// Goodbye Little Darlin' Goodbye //

Goodbye, little darlin', we're parting 
Parting don't always mean goodbye 
Although we had to part, you're always in my heart 
Goodbye, little darlin', goodbye 

Goodbye, little darlin', I'll miss you 
Miss you like the stars would miss the sky 
I hate to see you go, I'm gonna miss you so
Goodbye, little darlin', goodbye 

Goodbye, little darlin', I love you
Love you until the day I die 
Would you dream a dream of me, wherever you may be 
Goodbye, little darlin', goodbye

// I Just Thought You'd Like To Know //

I just thought you'd like to know
Since you'd made your plans to go
It's gonna hurt me so to see you go
But I hope you find another love and he'll be good to you
But still and yet I can't forget the things we used to do

I just thought I tell you this
I love you since that first sweet kiss
It's gonna hurt to miss your tender kiss
But I hope you get to do the things you say you wanna do
But still and yet I can't forget the happiness we knew

I just thought you'd like to know how much you've hurt my pride
I just thought you'd like to know how much my heart has cried over you
But darling you could never see the misery you caused for me
So I will tell you so cause I just thought that you'd like to know

// You Tell Me //

Tell me why she left me I'll tell you why I cried
Tell you why I stayed around tell me why she lied
I'll tell why my heart's broken tell me why she said goodbye
Tell me why she left me I'll tell you why I cried
You tell me then I'll tell you
I'll tell you why I loved her tell me why she said goodbye
Tell me why she left me I'll tell you why I cried

Tell me why I'm lonely I'll tell you why I'm alone
Tell you why I stayed around tell me why she's gone
I'll tell why my heart's broken tell me why she was untrue
Tell me why she left me and I'll tell you why I'm blue
You tell me then I'll tell you

// Just About Time //

(Just about time I'm feelin' blue tryin' to get over you)
Maybe it's just about time I told you I'm all through with you
But just about the time I start to tell you I start feeling blue
And just about then I lose my nerve and wait another day or two
Cause just about the time I think it's over I start missing you
(Hardest thing I'll ever do tryin' to get over you)
It's just about time I had my sayin' I told you a thing or two
It's just about time I paid you back you treat me like you do
But just about the time I get the nerve I can't seem to carry through
Cause just about then an mpty feelin' reminds me I miss you
(Like to find somebody new I could just get you)

(Just don't know what I go through tryin' to get over you)
It's just about time I let you know I've had my fill of you
But just about the time I think about goin' I start missin' you
I'd like to go find another love that'll never be untrue
But just about the time I think about leavin' I start missin' you
(Havin' a hard time feelin' blue tryin' to get over you)

// Katy Too //

I'm not the going steady kind
I miss 'em all, all the time
I told Annie I'd be true
But I still think about Katy too

Katy too, Katy too
I still think about Katy too

If you should see miss Mary-Ann
Just tell her I'm her loving man
Give my love to Jane and Sue
But don't forget ol' Katy too

Katy too, Katy too
Don't forget ol' Katy too

I like Sadie's chicken stew
And Suzie's good at stitchin' wool
I like Mary's barbecue
But I still like ol' Katy too

Katy too, Katy too
I still like ol' Katy too

Now, girls I'm not the flirty kind
But I just can't make up my mind
I'd like to marry all of you
But I still miss ol' Katy too

Katy too, Katy too
I still miss ol' Katy too

To all the girls I make this toast
I love you eveyone the most
But don't ask me to say "I do"
'Cause I still miss ol' Katy too

Katy too, Katy too
I still miss ol' Katy too

Cupid you bet you been good to me
I got more girls than I can see
But if you give me all but two
Then let's squeeze in ol' Katy too

Katy too, Katy too
Let's squeeze in ol' Katy too

// Thanks A Lot //

You're tellin' everyone in town that I don't treat you right
You even say I stay away and don't come home at night
I'm losing you and you are all I've got thanks a lot thanks a lot

It seems you like to hurt me and you know I'm good to you
I'd give you anything I own do anything you want me to
Yeah now you really got me on the spot thanks a lot thanks a lot

Still I would forgive you if you'd let me I'd be glad if we could try again
But it seems that you're just out to get me
And it looks as if you're just about to win
No matter what you do I'll always do love you
And you will never know how it hurts to see you go
And you're callin' me those things you know I'm not thanks a lot thanks a lot

No matter what you do I always do love you
And you will never know how it hurts to see you go
You say I'm happy but you know I'm not thanks a lot thanks a lot thanks a lot

// Luther Played The Boogie //

We were just a plain ol' hillbilly band with a plain ol' country style
We never played the kind of songs that'd drive anybody wild
Played a railroad song with a stomping beat
We played a blues song, kinda slow and sweet
But the thing that knocked them off of their feet was, ooh-wee
When Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie in the strangest kind of way
Play it strange!

Well, we did our best to entertain everywhere we'd go
We'd nearly wear our fingers off to give the folks a show
Played jumping jive to make 'em get in the groove
We played sad songs, real slow and smooth
But the only thing that'd make 'em move was, ooh-wee
When Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie woogie, Luther played the boogie woogie
Luther played the boogie

Now, did Luther play the boogie strange?

// You Win Again //

The news is out all over town
That you've been seen out runnin' around
I know that I should leave, but then
I just can't go,
You win again

This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trusting in you was my great sin
What can I do?
You Win Again

Yes this heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me
Just trusting you was my great sin
What can I do?
You Win Again

// Hey Good Lookin' //

Hey hey good lookin' whatcha got cookin' how's about cookin' somethin' up with me
Hey hey sweet baby don't you think maybe we could find us a brand new recepie
I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill and I know a spot right over the hill
There's soda pop and the dancin's free if you wanna have fun come along with me
Hey hey good lookin' whatcha got cookin' how's about cookin' somethin' up with me

I'm free and ready so we can go steady how's about savin' all your time for me
No more lookin' I know I've been tooken how's about keepin' steady company
I'm gonna throw my datebook over the fence find me one for five or ten cents
Keep it till it's covered with age cause I'm writin' your name down on every page
Say hey good lookin' whatcha got cookin' how's about cookin' somethin' up with me

// I Could Never Be Ashamed Of You //

Everybody says you let me down I should be ashamed to take you round
Makes no difference what you used to do darling I could never be ashamed of you

Maybe you were reckless yesterday but together we can find a brighter way
In my heart I know that you'll come true darling I could never be ashamed of you

All the happiness I've ever known came the day you said you'd be my own
And it matters not what we go through darling I could never be ashamed of you

Maybe you've been cheated in the past and perhaps those memories will always last
Even though you prove to be untrue darling I could never be ashamed of you

// Rock And Roll Ruby //

Well I took my Ruby jukin' 
On the out-skirts of town 
She took her high heels off 
And rolled her stockings down 
She put a quarter in the jukebox 
To get a little beat 
Everybody started watchin' 
All the rhythm in her feet 

She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll 
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll 
When Ruby starts a-rockin' 
Boy it satisfies my soul 

Now Ruby started rockin' 'bout one o'clock 
And when she started rockin' 
She just couldn't stop 
She rocked on the tables 
And rolled on the floor 
And Everybody yelled: "Ruby rock some more!" 

She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll 
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll 
When Ruby starts a-rockin' 
Boy it satisfies my soul 

It was 'round about four 
I thought she would stop 
She looked at me and then 
She looked at the clock 
She said: "Wait a minute Daddy 
Now don't get sour 
All I want to do 
Is rock a little bit more" 

She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll 
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll 
When Ruby starts a-rockin' 
Boy it satisfies my soul 

One night my Ruby left me all alone 
I tried to contact her on the telephone 
I finally found her about twelve o'clock 
She said: "Leave me alone Daddy 
'cause your Ruby wants to rock" 

She's my rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll 
Rock'n'roll Ruby, rock'n'roll 
When Ruby starts a-rockin' 
Boy it satisfies my soul 

Rock, rock, rock'n'roll 
Rock, rock, rock'n'roll 
Rock, rock, rock'n'roll 
Rock, rock, rock'n'roll 
When Ruby starts a-rockin' 
Boy it satisfies my soul
