// I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day //

I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

I thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along unbroken song
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong that mocks the song
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doubt He sleeps
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth goodwill to men

Till ringin' singin' on its way
The world revolve from night to day
A voice a chime a chance so blind
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doubt He sleeps
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth goodwill to men

// Silent Night //

(Silent night holy night)
Silent night holy night all is calm all is bright
Round young virgin mother and child holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night holy night all is dark save the light
See the eastern wise men bring gifts and homage to our King
Christ the Saviour is born Jesus the Saviour is born
Silent night (holy night) all is calm all is bright
Poorest dreams from heaven afar heavenly host sing hallelujah
(Christ the Savious is born Jesus the Saviour is born)
Silent night holy night wonderous dark lend Thy light
With the angels let us sing hallelujah hail the King
Christ the Saviour is born Jesus the Saviour is born.
