// Seasons Of My Heart //

The seasons come the seasons go
We get a little sunshine, rain and snow
Just the way that it was planned to be

But there's no seasons in my heart
While you play the leading part
'Cause the flowers will bloom eternally

Your leaving will bring autumn sorrow
And my tears like withered leaves will fall
But spring could bring some glad tomorrow
And, darling, we could be happy after all

As it is in nature's plan
No season get the upper hand
How I try to keep this fact in mind

The trees are bare the cold wind blows
And by experience we should know
Winter comes but the spring is close behind
Your leaving will bring

// I Feel Better All Over //

Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere else baby
When I'm out with you
Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere else
When you kiss me like you do

Well, I am as wild as a buck everytime you cause me up
You sure makes me feel like a wheel
Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere else
That's exactly how I feel

Oh, I feel better all over more than anywhere else
When you whisper sweet nothings in my ear
Oh, I feel better all over more than anywhere else, honey
Anytime that you're near

Well, my heart beats double time when you hold your hand in mine
You sure is a wonderful deal
Well, I feel better all over more than anywhere else
That's exactly how I feel

Oh, that's exactly how I feel

// I Couldn't Keep From Crying //

I saw you walking by his side
Heard you whisper all those lies and I
Couldn't keep from crying

You sang him love songs tenderly
Just the way you sang to me me and I
Couldn't keep from crying

I saw you capture all his charms
While he held you in his arms
With his pretty words and ways
In your heart, he took my place

I stood and watched him steal a kiss
From two lips, I know I'll miss and I
Couldn't keep from crying

I saw you capture all his charms
While he held you in his arms
With his pretty words and ways
In your heart, he took my place

From two lips, I know I'll miss and I
Couldn't keep from crying

// Time Changes Everything //

Time has passed I've forgotten mother nature does wonderful things 
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time changes everything 
You can change the name of an old song rearrange it and make it swing 
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you but time changes everything 

Goodbye goodluck may God bless you Idon't say I won't love again 
I guess that it's true for me and for you that time changes everything

// My Shoes Keep Walking Back To You //

I may say that I don't care, hold my up head up in the air
Even tell my friends I'm glad that you don't call
But when the day is through my heartaches start anew
And that's when I miss you most of all

And my arms keep reaching for you
My eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you

No matter how much I pretend I wish I had you back again
'Cause nothing else means half as much as you
My world just seemed to die the day you left my side
And I can't forget no matter what I do

And my arms keep reaching for you
My eyes keep searching for you
My lips keep calling for you
And my shoes keep walking back to you

// I'd Just Be Fool Enough (To Fall) //

Oh please don't be so careless with your glances
Don't look at me that way and breathe a sigh
Please don't get too close and let me love you
'Cause I just might be fool enough to try

It's not that I don't think I'm worthy of you
But memories from the past I still recall
Please don't get too close and let me love you
'Cause I just might be fool enough to fall

It's not that I don't think I'm worthy of you
But memories from the past I still recall
Oh, please don't get too close and let me love you
'Cause I just might be fool enough to fall

// Transfusion Blues //

Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds
Took a transfusion and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' 44 beneath my head

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a transfusion and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico

Late in the hot joints takin' the pills
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said, "Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down"

Said, "Yes, oh yes my name is Willy Lee
If you've got a warrant just a read it to me"
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
Put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that country jail

Into the courtroom my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commenced to look about

In about five minutes in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
Verdict read in the first degree
I hollered, "Lowdy, Lowdy have a mercy on me"

The judge he smiled as he picked up his been
Ninety-nine years in the San Quentin pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot my woman down

Come on you guys and listen unto me
Lay off that liquor and let that transfusion be

// Why Do You Punish Me (For Loving You) //

Why do you punish me for loving you?
You're counting my mistakes, how about yours

Why do you sentence me, too nice of tears?
Convicting all these dreams, I've dreamed for all these years

My heart cries out behind these prison bars
It pleads to you for your true love to set it free

Why do you punish me is love a crime?
If so I'll spend the lifetime, loving, serving time

My heart cries out behind these prison bars
It pleads to you for your true love to set it free

Why do you punish me is love a crime?
If so I'll spend the lifetime, loving, serving time

// I Will Miss You When You Go //

I will miss you when you go much more than you'll ever know 
But I'll have a memory to keep you near 
In my heart you will remain but it just won't be the same 
I will miss a million things that make you dear 
Your lovely ways make you so sweet I prayed the angels fair will keep 
You're happiness so you'll be blessed just as you deserve to be 
I wonder why there are so few lovely people like you 
My but I will surely miss you when you go 

Your lovely ways make you...

// Just One More //

Put the bottle on the table
Let it stay there till I'm not able
To see your face in every place that I go
I've been sitting here so long
Just remembering that you are gone

One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind
One drink just one more and then another

I'll keep drinking it won't matter
I'll just remember that I once had her
I don't know why, I sat and cry every day
I've been trying to forget
But I haven't stopped as yet

One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind
One drink just one more and then another

Put the bottle on the table
Let it stay there till I'm not able
To see your face in every place that I go
I've been sitting here so long
Just remembering that you are gone

One more drink of wine and if you're still on my mind
One drink just one more and then another
