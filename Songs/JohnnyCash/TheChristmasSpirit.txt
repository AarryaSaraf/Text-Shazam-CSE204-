// Ballad Of The Harp Weaver //

Son said my mother when I was knee high 
You need of clothes to cover you and not a rag have I 
There's nothing in the house to make a boy's britches 
Nor shears to cut a cloth with nor thread to take stitches 
There's nothing in the house but a leaf end of rye 
And the harp with a with the woman's head nobody will by and she began to cry 
That was in the early fall and when came the late fall 
Son she said the sight of you makes your mother's blood crawl 
Little skinny shoulder blades stickin' through your clothes 
And where you get a jacket from God above knows 
It's lucky for me lad your daddy's in the ground 
And can't see the way I let his son go around and she made a queer sound 
That was in the late fall when the winter came 
I'd not a pair of bridges nor a shirt to my name 
I couldn't go to school or out of doors to play 
And all the other little boys passed our way 
Son said my mother come climb into my lap 
And I'll chave your little knees while you take a nap 
And oh but we were silly for half an hour or more 
Me with my long legs draggin' on the floor 
I rocked rocked rocked to a mother goose rhyme 
Oh but we were happy for half an hour's time 
But there was I a great boy and what would folks say 
To hear my mother singin' me to sleep all day in such a daft way 
Men say the winter was bad that year fuel was scarce and food was dear 
A wind with a wolf's head howled about our door 
And we burned up the chairs and sat upon the floor 
All that was left us was a chair we couldn't break 
And the harp with the woman's head nobody would take for song or pity sake 
The night before Christmas I cried with the cold 
I cried myself to sleep like a two year old 
And in the deep night I felt my mother rise 
And stare down upon me with love in her eyes 
I saw my mother sitting on the one good chair 
A light falling on her face from I couldn't tell where 
Looking nineteen and not a day older 
And the harp with the woman's head leaned against her shoulder 
Her thin fingers moving in the thin tall strings 
Were weave weave weaving wonderful things 
Many bright threads from where I couldn't see 
Were running through the harp strings rapidly 
And gold threads whistlin' through my mother's hands 
I saw the web grow and the pattern expand 
She wove a child's jacket and when it was done 
She laid it on the floor and wove another one 
She wove a red cloak so regal to see 
She's made it for a king's son I said and not for me but I knew it was for me 
She wove a pair of bridges and quicker than that 
She wove a pair of boots a little cocked hat 
She wove a pair of mittens she wove a little blouse 
She wove all night in the still cold house 
She sang as she worked and the harp strings spoke 
But her voice never faltered and the thread never broke 
But when I awoke there sat my mother 
With the harp against her shoulder lookin' nineteen and not a day older 
A smile about her lips and a light about her head 
And her hands in the harp strings frozen dead 
And piled up beside her toppling to the skies 
Were the clothes of a king's son just my size

// The Christmas Spirit //

Praises sing to Christ the King
And peace to men on earth

On Christmas Eve I dreamed I traveled all around the earth
And in my dream I saw and heard the ways the different people
Hail the king whose star shone in the east and what a dream it was

In London Town I walked around Piccadilly Circus
A mass of people movin' here and there, I wondered where
On every face at every place was, "Hurry up, I'm late"
But a kind old man at a chestnut stand said, "Merry Christmas mate"
And I felt the Christmas spirit

In a little town nestled down in Bavaria Germany
I walked along to see what the feeling there would be
And here again was the busy din, the rushin', the yellin'
But some kind boy said, "Frohliche Weihnachten"
Not understanding the words but gettin' the buyin' and sellin'
I felt the Christmas spirit

In Bethlehem I heard a hymn, some distant choir sang
And with other tourists I walked along to a Church as its bells rang
Then I heard someone tell someone, "There's where Christ was born"
I wonder if He looked like our baby looked on that first morn
And then I really felt the Christmas spirit

From a businessman in the Holy Land at a sidewalk souvenirshop
I bought a little Bible since I'd already stopped
And it was in Paris France somehow by chance that I took the Bible out
As I flipped the pages I saw these words

And I knew what it was all about
For I read, "Fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy
Which shall be to all people
For unto you He was born this day in the City of David, a Saviour
Which is Christ the Lord"

Then I took the little Holy Book, held it close and tight
I closed my eyes and visualized the glory of that night
So suddenly it came to me for when I awoke on Christmas Day
I felt the Christmas spirit down deep inside to stay

O little town of Bethlehem how still we see Thee lie
Above Thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in Thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in Thee tonight

// Blue Christmas //

I'll have a blue blue Christmas

I'll have a blue blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red, on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me

I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain
And when those blue blue heartaches start hurtin'
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas

I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red, on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me

I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain
And when those blue heartaches start hurtin'
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas

A blue blue Christmas without you

// The Gifts They Gave //

Jesus our King, kind and good
Was humbly born in a stable of wood
And the lowly beasts around Him stood
Jesus our King, kind and good

"I", said the donkey, shaggy and brown
"I carried His mother up and down
I carried His mother to Bethlehem town"
"I", said the donkey, shaggy and brown

"I", said the ox, "This was my hay
I gave Him my manger, 'twas here that He lay
I gave Him my manger, 'twas here that He lay"
"I", said the ox, "This was my hay"

"I" said the sheep with pearly horn
"I gave Him my wool for a blanket warm
He wore my coat on Christmas morn"
"I", said the sheep with pearly horn

"I", said the dove, from the rafters high
"I sang Him to sleep that He would not cry
We sang Him to sleep, my love and I"
"I", said the dove, from the rafters high

And so every heart, by some good spell
In the stable dark, was glad to tell
Of the gift that he gave to Emmanuel
Of the gift that he gave to Emmanuel

// Here Was A Man //

(Joy to the world, the Lord is come)
Here was a man, a man
Who was born in a small village
The son of a peasant woman
He grew up in another small village
Until he reached the age of thirty
He worked as a carpenter

Then for three years
He was a traveling minister
But he never traveled more
Than two hundred miles from
Where he was born and
Where he did go he usually walked

He never held political office
He never wrote a book
Never bought a home
Never had a family
He never went to college
And he never set foot inside a big city

Yes, here was a man

Though he never did one on the things
Usually associated with greatness
He had no credentials but himself
He had nothing to do with this world
Except through the divine purpose
That brought him to this world

While he was still a young man
The tide of popular opinion turned against him
Most of his friends ran away
One of them denied him
One of them betrayed him
And turned him over to his enemies
Then he went through the mockery of a trial

And was nailed to a cross between two thieves
And even while he was dying
His executioners gambled
For the only piece of property
That he had in this world
And that was his robe his purple robe

When he was dead
He was taken down from the cross
And laid in a borrowed grave
Provided by compassionate friends
More than nineteen centuries have come and gone
And today he's a centerpiece of the human race
Our leader in the column to human destiny

I think, I'm well within the mark when I say
That all of the armies that ever marched
All of the navies that ever sailed the seas
All of the legislative bodies that ever sat
And all of the kings that ever reigned
All of them put together have not affected
The life of man on this earth
So powerfully as that one solitary life

Here was a man
(Joy to the world, the Lord is come)

// The Little Drummer Boy //

Come they told me
Our newborn King to see
Our finest gifts we bring
To lay before the King

This is to honor Him
When we come

Baby Jesus, I am a poor boy too
I have no gift to bring
That's fit to give a King

But may I play for You
On my drum

The Mother Mary nodded
The ox and lamb kept time
I played my drum for Him
I played my best for Him

Then He smiled at me
Me and my drum

// Ringing The Bells For Jim //

The father heard church bells at midnight
A wrong time for church bells to chime
He went to the tower, found a little girl there
Said, "Why ring the bells at this time?"

"I'm just ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, ringing the bells for Jim
I'm sorry, I'm cryin' but my brother Jim's dyin'
So, I'm ringing the bells for Jim"

Please father, pray for him this Christmas
He's sick and he's in so much pain
The doctors all say, he'll be gone any day
So, I must ring the bells again

I'm just ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, ringing the bells for Jim
I'm sorry, I'm cryin' but my brother Jim's dyin'
So, I'm ringing the bells for Jim

On the day after Christmas
She brought him said, "Father, heed little Jim
You see, he got well, when he heard the church bells
I was ringing the bells for Jim"

"I'm just ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, ringing the bells for Jim
I'm sorry, I'm cryin' but my brother Jim's dyin'
So, I'm ringing the bells for Jim"

// We Are The Shepherds //

So here is the stable and there is the manger
The new Saviour sleeps on His first earthly night
The wise men brought riches but we brought a candle
It's all that we have but it gives a good light

We are the shepherds we walked cross the mountains
We left our flocks when the new star appeared
Oh, the beautiful singin' of heavenly choir
We had to come see Him, we had to come here

We beg You forgive us for such a small offering
But our sheep are out there with wolves in the night
We bring You this candle it's all we have with us
But with it the new Saviour has His first light
We are the shepherds

We thank Thee kind Joseph for bidding us enter
Please take our gift for the new babe to thine
'Tis only one candle but it is our symbol
Of how we believe that His great life will shine
We are the shepherds

// Who Kept The Sheep //

The shepherds afar left their flocks by night
Followed the new star by its heavenly light
Did the lambs fear the wolves
Did they lay down and sleep

Who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep

Did robbers not steal or did they fear the light
That the shepherds had followed night after night
Did they not stray
Did little lambs weep

Who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep

Under the new star, the new Saviour lay in his dim manger
He lay on the hay
The shepherds that came had a vigil to keep
But who kept the sheep

Who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep
Who kept the sheep
