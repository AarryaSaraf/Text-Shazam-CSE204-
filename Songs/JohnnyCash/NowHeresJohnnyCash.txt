// Cry, Cry, Cry //

Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down.
I think you only live to see the lights uptown.
I wasted my time when I would try, try, try.
'Cause when the lights have lost their glow, you'll cry, cry, cry.

Soon your sugar-daddies will all be gone.
You'll wake up some cold day and find you're alone.
You'll call for me but I'm gonna tell you: "Bye, bye, bye, "
When I turn around and walk away, you'll cry, cry, cry,

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll cry alone,
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.

I lie awake at night to wait 'til you come in
You stay a little while and then you're gone again
Every question that I ask, I get a lie, lie, lie
For every lie you tell, you're gonna cry, cry, cry

When your fickle love gets old, no one will care for you.
Then you'll come back to me for a little love that's true.
I'll tell you no and then you'll ask me why, why, why?
When I remind you of all of this, you'll cry, cry, cry.

You're gonna cry, cry, cry and you'll want me then,
It'll hurt when you think of the fool you've been.
You're gonna cry, cry, cry.

// So Doggone Lonesome //

I do my best to hide this lowdown feelin'
I try to make believe there's nothin' wrong
But they're always askin' me about you darlin'
And it hurts me so to tell 'em that you're gone

If they ask me, I guess, I'd be denyin'
That I've been unhappy all alone
But if they heard my heart they'd hear it cryin'
Where's my darlin' when's she comin' home

I ask myself a million times what's right for me to do
To try to lose my blues alone or hang around for you
Well I make it pretty good until that moon comes shinin' through
And that I get so doggone lonesome

Time stands still when you're a waitin'
Sometimes I think my heart is stoppin' too
One lonely hour seems forever
Sixty minutes more to wait for you

But I guess I'll keep waitin' till you're with me
'Cause I believe that lovin' you is right
But I don't care if the sun don't rise tomorrow
If I can't have you with me tonight

Well I know, I'll keep on loving you 'cause true love can't be killed
I ought to get you off of my mind but I guess I never will
I could have a dozen others but I know, I'd love you still
'Cause I get so doggone lonesome

// Sugartime //

Well now sugar in the morning sugar in the evening sugar at suppertime
Be my little sugar and love me all the time
Honey in the morning honey in the evening honey at suppertime
Be my little honey and love me all the time

Put your arms around me swear by stars above
You'll be mine forever in the heaven of love
Sugar in the morning sugar in the evening sugar at suppertime
Be my little sugar and love me all the time

Now sugar time is anytime that you're near oh you're so dear
Now don't you roam just be my honeycomb and live in a heaven of love

Well sugar in the morning...

// Down The Street To 301 //

There's a boy across the street lately he's looked very neat
Seems he's always on the run down the street to 301
(Seems he's always on the run down the street to 301)

Saturday he mows the lawn it's about a crack of dawn
Nine o'clock the work's all done down the street to 301
(Nine o'clock the work's all done down the street to 301)

When it's back to school this fall winter's chill may end it all
But for now there's lots of fun with the girl at 301
(But for now there's lots of fun with the girl at 301)

Maybe they will never wed sure they may break up instead
But for now she is the one the girl who lives at 301
(But for now she is the one the girl who lives at 301)

The boy who lives across the street has a reason to be neat
He's in love and on the run with the girl at 301
(He's in love and on the run with the girl at 301)

Don't you tell 'em to beware of a summer love affair
You know she is only one the girl that live at 301
(You know she is only one the girl that live at 301)

// Life Goes On //

My baby left me just the other day
I guess the things will never be the same
But I must forget that she is gone
Cause time goes by and life goes on

Making plans, shaking hands
Try to prove that I'm a man
It's hard to do but I must try
Cause life goes on and so will I

It's been kinda tough these last few days
Trying to act normal and be gay
It's not easy to be all alone
But time goes by and life goes on

If I see her anywhere
I hope she thinks that I don't care
For after night there comes the dawn
Yes time goes by and life goes on

// Port Of Lonely Hearts //

A ship came in, but it was empty;
And then it sailed back out to sea again.
Now there's the sail on the horizon,
And now I wait until your ship comes in.

And I'll be waiting in the port of lonely hearts,
Watchin' for your topsail on the sea.
Prayin' that my ship of love will come 
To the port of lonely hearts where I will be.

I'll brave the storm until you're with me,
Cause wind and rain can't change a love that's true.
I'll be alone until you anchor and then
I'll leave this lonely port with you.

Till then I'm waiting in the port of lonely hearts,
Watchin' for your topsail on the sea.
Prayin' that my ship of love will come
To the port of lonely hearts where I will be.

// My Treasure //

I saved a lot of money my fortune was untold 
And like a fool I idealized my silver and my gold 
My earthly treasure's mounted but when I counted through 
I realized the treasure I had overlooked was you 

My treasure unmeasured but forsaken of the treasures that come from above 
My treasure unmeasured but it don't hold a heart of the one that I love 

If I had my life before me if I could see it all 
I'd stake my claim on things that are secured against downfall 
I'd work for earthly treasures like any man would do 
But I set my sights much higher and I'd be sure that I had you 

My treasure unmeasured unmeasured...

// Oh Lonesome Me //

Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set set me free oh lonesome me

A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
I thought of everything from A to Z oh lonesome me

I'll bet she's not like me she's out and fancy free
Flirtin' with the boys with all her charms
But I still love her so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms

Well there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I thought of everything from A to Z oh lonesome me oh lonesome me

Well I'll bet she's not like me...
Oh lonesome me

// Home Of The Blues //

Just around the corner there's heartache
Down the street that losers use
If you can wade in through the teardrops
You'll find me at the Home of the Blues

I walk and cry while my heartbeat
Keeps time with the drag of my shoes
The sun never shines through this window of mine
It's dark at the Home of the Blues

Oh, but the place is filled with the sweetest mem'ries
Mem'ries so sweet that I cry
Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad
I just want to give up and lay down and die

So if you've just lost your sweetheart
And it seems there's no good way to choose
Come along with me, misery loves company
You're welcome at the Home of the Blues

Oh, but the place is filled with the sweetest mem'ries
Mem'ries so sweet that I cry
Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad
I just want to give up and lay down and die

So if you've just lost your sweetheart
And it seems there's no good way to choose
Come along with me, misery loves company
You're welcome at the Home of the Blues
You'll find me at the Home of the Blues
Yeah, you're gonna find me at the Home of the Blues

// You're The Nearest Thing To Heaven //

I have sailed the peaceful waters of the ocean deep and blue
I held my breath and watched the western sunsets golden hue
I've flown above the mountain peaks and valleys wide and green
But you're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

You're the nearest thing to heaven yes you are
I have searched for happiness so long and far
But my search for love was through the day that I found you
Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven yes you are

I confess that I've been tempted by a luring magic charms
When the smile was flashed my way and stood before two open arms
But I turned and walked away because I love you like I do
You're the nearest thing to heaven darlin' you

You're the nearest thing to heaven...

I have watched the silver raindrops fall to earth to cool the day
Watched the rainbow at twilight when the clouds had blown away
I love the pretty flowers but they cannot buy the worth
Cause you're the nearest thing to heaven on this earth

You're the nearest thing to heaven...

// The Story Of A Broken Heart //

Hmm the story of a broken heart 
Well the sprinftime is coming and the honeybees are humming 
And I just saw a robin flying by 
While your wedding bells are ringing my poor heart is singing 
The story of a broken heart hmm the story of a broken heart 

When the trees start to blooding the mem'ries start to flooding 
And my heart takes a trip to yesterday 
When we walked neath the moon an our love was in bloom 
Now we're two lovers drifted apart hmm the story of a broken heart 

Now the wedding invitation forced out to your relation 
But you ask me to give the pride away 
Although I can't show it I think that you'll know it 
A story that's told from my heart hmm the story of a broken heart
