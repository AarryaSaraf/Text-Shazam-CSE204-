// The Suburbs //

In the suburbs I
I learned to drive
And you told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys we're leavin'

You always seemed so sure
That one day we'd be fighting
In a suburban war
Your part of town against mine
I saw you standing on the opposite shore

But by the time the first bombs fell
We were already bored
We were already, already bored

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling again

Kids wanna be so hard
But in my dreams we're still screamin' and runnin' through the yard
And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
And all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall
Meant nothin' at all
Meant nothin' at all
It meant nothin

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling and into the night

So can you understand
Why I want a daughter while I'm still young?
I wanna hold her hand
And show her some beauty
Before all this damage is done

But if it's too much to ask, if it's too much to ask
Then send me a son

Under the overpass
In the parking lot we're still waiting
It's already past
So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
Cause it's already past
It's already, already past

Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm movin' past the feeling again

I'm movin' past the feeling
I'm movin' past the feeling

In my dreams we're still screamin'
We're still screamin'
We're still screamin'

// Ready To Start //

If the businessmen drink my blood
Like the kids in art school said they would
Then I guess I'll just begin again
You say, "can we still be friends? "

If I was scared... I would
And if I was bored... you know I would
And if I was yours... but I'm not

All the kids have always known
That the emperor wears no clothes
But they bow down to him anyway
'Cause it's better than being alone

If I was scared... I would
And if I was bored... you know I would
And if I was yours... but I'm not

Now you're knocking at my door
Saying please come out with us tonight
But I would rather be alone
Than pretend I feel alright

If the businessmen drink my blood
Like the kids in art school said they would
Then I guess I'll just begin again
You say, "can we still be friends? "

If I was scared... I would
And if I was pure... you know I would
And if I was yours... but I'm not

Now I'm ready to start

If I was scared... I would
And if I was pure... you know I would
And if I was yours... but I'm not

Now I'm ready to start

Now I'm ready to start
I would rather be wrong
Than live in the shadows of your song
My mind is open wide
And now I'm ready to start

Now I'm ready to start
My mind is open wide
And now I'm ready to start
You're not sure
You open the door
And step out into the dark

Now I'm ready

// Modern Man //

So I wait my turn, I'm a modern man
And the people behind me, they can't understand
Makes me feel like
Makes me feel like

So I wait in line, I'm a modern man
And the people behind me, they can't understand
Makes me feel like
Something don't feel right

Like a record that's skipping
I'm a modern man
And the clock keeps ticking
I'm a modern man
Makes me feel like
Makes me feel like

In my dream I was almost there
Then they pulled me aside and said you're going nowhere
They say we are the chosen few
But we waste it
And that's why we're still waiting
On a number from the modern man
Maybe when you're older you will understand
Why you don't feel right
Why you can't sleep at night now

In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man

Oh I had a dream I was dreaming
And I feel I'm losing the feeling
Makes me feel like
Like something don't feel right
I erase the number of the modern man
Want to break the mirror of the modern man
Makes me feel like
Makes me feel like

In my dream I was almost there
Then they pulled me aside and said you're going nowhere
I know we are the chosen few
But we waste it
And that's why we're still waiting
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man

If it's alright
Then how come you can't sleep at night?
In line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man

I'm a modern man
I'm a modern man
I'm a modern man
I'm a modern man

// Rococo //

Let's go downtown and watch the modern kids
Let's go downtown and talk to the modern kids
They will eat right out of your hand
Using great big words that they don't understand
They're singing:

Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo
Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo

They build it up just to burn it back down
They build it up just to burn it back down
The wind is blowing all the ashes around
Oh my dear God what is that horrible song they're singin'

Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo
Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo
Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo
Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo
Rococo, rococo!
Rococo!

They seem wild but they are so tame
They seem wild but they are so tame
They're moving towards you with their colors all the same
They want to own you but they don't know what game they're playing

Rococo, rococo, rococo, rococo
Rococo!
Rococo!

(Rococo)
(Rococo)

Rococo!
Rococo!

(Rococo)
(Rococo)

Rococo!

// Empty Room //

Said your name, in an empty room
Said your name, in an empty room
Something I would never do

Said your name, in an empty room
Said your name, in an empty room
Something I would never do

I'm alone again

When I'm by myself
I can be myself
And my life is coming
But I don't know when

You were burning out, you're black and gray
You were burning out, you're black and gray
Something I would never say

I'm alone again

When I'm by myself
I can be myself
And my life is coming
But I don't know when

Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Moi j'attends, toi tu pars

Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Moi j'attends, toi tu pars

// City With No Children //

The summer that I broke my arm
I waited for your letter
I have no feeling for you now
Now that I know you better

I wish that I could have loved you then
Before our age was through
And before a world war does with us whatever it will do

Dreamt I drove home to Houston
On a highway that was underground
There was no light that we could see
As we listened to the sound
Of the engine failing

I feel like I've been living in
A city with no children in it
A garden left for ruin by a millionaire inside of a private prison

You never trust a millionaire quoting the sermon on the mount
I used to think I was not like them but I'm beginning to have my doubts
My doubts about it

When you're hiding underground
The rain can't get you wet
But do you think your righteousness could pay the interest on your debt?
I have my doubts about it

I feel like I've been living in
A city with no children in it
A garden left for ruin by a millionaire inside of a private prison

I feel like I've been living in
A city with no children in it
A garden left for ruin by and by as I hide inside of my private prison

// Half Light I //

You told us that
We were too young
Now that night's closing in
And in the half light
We run
Lock us up safe
And hide the key
But the night tears us loose
And in the half light
We're free

Strange how the half light
Can make a place new
You can't recognize me
And I can't recognize you

We run through these streets
That we know so well
And the houses hide so much
But in the half light
None of us can tell
They hide the ocean in a shell
The ocean in a shell

Our heads are just houses
Without enough windows
You say you hear human voices
But they're only echoes

They're only echoes
They're only echoes
Only echoes

[x3:]
We are not asleep,
We are in the streets

// Half Light II (No Celebration) //

Now that San Francisco's gone,
I guess I'll just pack it in.
Wanna wash away my sins,
In the presence of my friends.

You and I we head back East,
To find a town where we can live.
Even in the half light,
We can see that something's gotta give.

When we watched the markets crash,
The promises we made were torn
Then my parents sent for me,
From out West where I was born.

Some people say, we've already lost,
But they're afraid to pay the cost for what we've lost.
Pay the cost for what we've lost

Now that you have left me here,
I will never raise my voice.
All the diamonds you have here,
In this home which has no life.

Oh, this city's changed so much
Since I was a little child.
Pray that God won't live to see
The death of everything that's wild.

Though we knew this day would come,
Still it took us by surprise.
In this town where I was born,
I now see through a dead man's eyes.

One day they will see it's long gone.
One day they will see it's long gone.
One day they will see it's long gone.
One day they will see it's long gone.

// Suburban War //

Let's go for a drive
And see the town tonight
There's nothing to do but I don't mind when I'm with you

This town's so strange
They built it to change
And while we sleep we know the streets get rearranged

And my old friends, we were so different then
Before your war against the suburbs began
Before it began

Now the music divides
Us into tribes
You grew your hair so I grew mine
You said the past won't rest
Until we jump the fence
And leave it behind

My old friends, I can remember when
You cut your hair
I never saw you again
Now the cities we live in
Could be distant stars
And I search for you
In every passing car

The night's so warm
Yeah, the night's so warm
I've been living in the shadows of your song
Living in the shadows of your song

In the suburbs I
I learned to drive
And you told me we would never survive
So grab your mother's keys we leave tonight

But you started a war
That you can't win
They keep erasing all the streets we grew up in

Now the music divides
Us into tribes
You choose your side and I'll choose my side

All my old friends, they don't know me now
Oh-oh
All my old friends, are staring through me now
Oh-oh
All my old friends, they don't know me now
All my old friends, they don't know me now

All my old friends wait

// Month Of May //

One two three four!

Gonna make a record in the month of May
In the month of May, in the month of May
Gonna make a record in the month of May
When the violent wind blows the wires away

Month of May, it's a violent thing
In the city their hearts start to sing
Well, some people sing,
It sounds like they're screaming
Used to doubt it
But now I believe it

Month of May, everybody's in love
Then the city was hit from above
And just when I knew what I wanted to say
A violent wind blew the wires away

We were shocked in the suburbs

Now the kids are all standing with their arms folded tight
Kids are all standing with their arms folded tight
Well, some things are pure and some things are right
But the kids are still standing with their arms folded tight
I said some things are pure and some things are right
But the kids are still standing with their arms folded tight

So young, so young
So much pain for someone so young, well
I know it's heavy, I know it ain't light
But how you gonna lift it with your arms folded tight?

First the built the road, then they built the town
That's why we're still driving around
And around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around

Two-thousand nine, two-thousand ten
Wanna make a record how I felt then
When we stood outside in the month of May
And watched the violent wind blow the wires away

If I die in the month of May
Let the wind take my body away, yeah
I wish I may, I wish I might
Don't lay me down there with my arms folded tight

Start again in the month of May
Start again in the month of May
Come on and blow the wires away
Come on and blow the wires away

Start again in the month of May
Start again in the month of May
Come on and blow the wires away
Come on and blow the wires away

Start again in the month of May
Start again in the month of May
Come on and blow the wires away
Come on and blow the wires, the wires away

// Wasted Hours //

All those wasted hours we used to know
Spent the summer staring out the window
The wind it takes you where it wants to go

First they built the road, then they built the town
That's why we're still driving around and around
And all we see
Are kids in buses longing to be free

Wasted hours, before we knew
Where to go, and what to do
Wasted hours that you make new
And turn into
A life that we can live

Some cities make you lose your head
Endless suburbs stretched out thin and dead
And what was that line you said?

Wishing you were anywhere but here
You watch the life you're living disappear
And now I see
We're still kids in buses
Longing to be free

Wasted hours, before we knew
Where to go, and what to do
Wasted hours, that you make new
And turn into
A life that we can live

// Deep Blue //

Here
In my place and time
And here in my own skin
I can finally begin
Let the century pass me by
Standing under night sky
Tomorrow means nothing

I was only a child then
Feeling barely alive when
I heard a song from the speaker of a passing car
And prayed to a dying star
The memory's fading
I can almost remember singing
La la, la la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la

We watched the end of the century
Compressed on a tiny screen
A dead star collapsing and we could see
That something was ending
Are you through pretending
We saw the signs in the suburbs?

You could never predict it
That it could see through you
Kasparov - Deep Blue 1996
Your mind's playing tricks now
Show is over so take a bow
We're living in the shadows of...
La la, la la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la

La la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la

Hey
Put the cellphone down for a while
In the night there is something wild
Can you hear it breathing?
And hey
Put the laptop down for a while
In the night there is something wild
I feel it, it's leaving me

La la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la

// We Used To Wait //

I used to write
I used to write letters
I used to sign my name

I used to sleep at night
Before the flashing light settled deep in my brain

But by the time we met
By the time we met the times had already changed

So I never wrote a letter
I never took my true heart, I never wrote it down

So when the lights cut out
I was lost standing in the wilderness downtown

Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

Now it seems strange
How we used to wait for letters to arrive
But what's stranger still
Is how something so small can keep you alive

We used to wait
We used to waste hours just walking around
We used to wait
All those wasted lives in the wilderness downtown

We used to wait
We used to wait
We used to wait
Sometimes it never came
We used to wait
Sometimes it never came
We used to wait
I'm still moving through the pain

I'm gonna write
A letter to my true love
I'm gonna sign my name

Like a patient on a table
I wanna walk again
Gonna move through the pain

Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last

We used to wait
We used to wait
We used to wait
Sometimes it never came
We used to wait
Sometimes it never came
We used to wait
I'm still moving through the pain
We used to wait
We used to wait
We used to wait

We used to wait for it
We used to wait for it
Now they're screaming "sing the chorus again! "

We used to wait for it.
We used to wait for it.
Now we're screaming "sing the chorus again! "

I used to wait for it
I used to wait for it
Hear my voice screaming "sing the chorus again! "

Wait for it!
Wait for it!
Wait for it!

// Sprawl I (Flatland) //

Took a drive into the sprawl
To find the house where we used to stay
Couldn't read the number in the dark
You said let's save it for another day

Took a drive into the sprawl
To find the places we used to play
It was the loneliest day of my life
You're talking at me but I'm still far away

Let's take a drive
Through the sprawl
Through these towns they built to change
Then you said, the emotions are dead
It's no wonder that you feel so strange

Cops shone their lights
On the reflectors of our bikes
Said, do you kids know what time it is?
Well sir, it's the first time I've felt like something is mine
Like I have something to give
The last defender of the sprawl
Said, well where do you kids live?
Well sir, if you only knew
What the answer is worth
Been searching every corner
Of the earth

// Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains) //

They heard me singing and they told me to stop
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock
These days my life, I feel it has no purpose
But late at night the feelings swim to the surface

'Cause on the surface the city lights shine
They're calling at me, come and find your kind
Sometimes I wonder if the World's so small
That we can never get away from the sprawl
Living in the sprawl
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
And there's no end in sight
I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights

We rode our bikes to the nearest park
Sat under the swings and kissed in the dark
We shield our eyes from the police lights
We run away, but we don't know why
Black river, your city lights shine
They're screaming at us, we don't need your kind
Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small
That we can never get away from the sprawl
Living in the sprawl
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
And there's no end in sight
I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights

They heard me singing and they told me to stop
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock
Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small
Can we ever get away from the sprawl?
Living in the sprawl
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
And there's no end in sight
I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights
I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights

// The Suburbs (Continued) //

If I could have it back
All the time that we wasted
I'd only waste it again
If I could have it back
You know I'd love to waste it again
Waste it again and again and again

I've got to ask
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again
Sometimes I can't believe it...

// Culture War //

Now the future's staring at me
like a vision from the past,
and I know these crumbs they sold me,
they're never gonna last.
Though we know the culture war,
we don't know what it's for but
we've lived the southern strategy.
You know it's never gonna last,
so keep it in the past.

These are different times that we're living in.
These are different times.
Now the kids are growing up so fast.
Paying for our crimes.

You left while I was sleepin'.
You said, "It's down to me".
Oh I've read a little Bible.
You see what you want to see.
Oh, we know the culture war,
we don't know what it's for but
we've lived your southern strategy.
You know it's never gonna last
so keep that shit in the past.

These are different times that we're living in.
'Cause these are different times.
Now the kids are growing up so fast.
They're paying for our crimes.

The dominos they never fell
but bodies they still burn.
Throw my hand into the fire
but still I never learn,
will I ever learn?

That these are different times.
Now the kids are growing up so fast
and paying for our crimes.
We'll be soldiers for you, mommy and daddy,
in your culture war.
We'll be soldiers for you, mommy and daddy,
but we don't know what it's for.

We're soldiers now in the culture war.
We're soldiers now, but we don't know what it's for.
We're soldiers now in the culture war.
We're soldiers now, but we don't know what it's for.
So tell me what's it for.

You want it? You got it, here's your culture war.
You want it? Now you've got it, so tell me what's it for.

// Speaking In Tongues //

Hypocrite reader,
My double, my brother

Your daddy really took it out of you

But did he speak it in tongues?
But did he speak it in tongues?

Sneaking out the windows now

You've got the spirit now

Hypocrite reader,
My double, my brother

Where did we lose our way?

It's like we're speaking in tongues
It's like we're speaking in tongues

Sneaking out the windows now

You've got the spirit now
You've got the spirit now
You've got the spirit now

Hypocrite reader,
My double, my brother

Now I can't understand a word

Now you're speaking in tongues
(Speaking in tongues)
Now you're speaking in tongues
(Speaking in tongues)
Now you're speaking in tongues
(Speaking in tongues)
Now you're speaking in tongues

Come out of your head
And into my world now

Come out of your head
