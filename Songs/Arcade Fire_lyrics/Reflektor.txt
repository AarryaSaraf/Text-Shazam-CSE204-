Album: Reflektor

// Reflektor //

Trapped in a prison,
in a prism of light.
Alone in the darkness, 
a darkness of white.
We fell in love, 
alone on a stage,
in the reflective age.

Entre la nuit, la nuit et l'aurore.
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts.
[Translation: "Between the night, the night and the dawn. Between the realm of the living and the dead."]

If this is heaven,
I don't know what it's for.
If I can't find you there,
I don't care.

I thought I found a way to enter;
it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)
I thought I found the connector;
it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)

Now the signals we send
are deflected again.
We're so connected, 
but are we even friends? 

We fell in love when I was 19,
and now we're staring at a screen.

Entre la nuit, la nuit et l'aurore.
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts.

If this is heaven,
I need something more.
Just a place to be alone,
cause you're my home.

I thought I found a way to enter;
it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)
I thought I found the connector;
it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)
Just a reflector.

It's just a reflector, just a reflector.
It's just a reflector, just a reflector.
Just a reflector, reflector.

Just a reflector. [repeat x 7]

Just a reflection of a reflection
of a reflection of a reflection of a reflection (ah!),
but I see you on the other side.
We all got things to hide.

Just a reflection of a reflection
of a reflection of a reflection of a reflection (ah!),
but I see you on the other side.
We all got things to hide.

(Alright let's go back.)

Our song it skips
on little silver disks.
Our love is plastic, 
and they break it to bits.

I want to break free, 
but will they break me
down, down down,
don't mess around.

I thought I found a way to enter;
it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)
I thought I found the connector;
it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)

It's just a reflector. [repeat]

Thought you were praying to the resurrector;
turns out it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector;
turns out it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)
Thought you were praying to the resurrector;
turns out it was just a reflector. (Just a reflector)

Just a reflector.
Just a reflector.
Just a reflector.

But I see you on the other side.

Just a reflector.

(Ah!)

But I see you on the other side. (Reflector)
We all got things to hide. (Reflector)

Just a reflector.

But I see you on the other side.

// We Exist //

They're walking around
Head full of sound
Acting like
We don't exist
They walk in the room
And stare right through you
Talking like
We don't exist
But we exist

Daddy it's true
I'm different from you
But tell me why they treat me like this?
If you turned away
What would I say?
Not the first betrayed by a kiss

Maybe it's true
They're staring at you
When you walk in the room
Tell 'em it's fine
Stare if you like
Just let us through
Just let us through
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

They're down on their knees
Begging us please
Praying that we don't exist
Daddy it's fine
I'm used to 'em now
But tell me why they treat me like this?
It's cause we do it like this

Maybe it's true
They're staring at you
When you walk in the room
Tell 'em it's fine
Stare if you like
Just let us through
Just let us through
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

Let 'em stare, let 'em stare!
If that's all they can do!
But I'd lose my heart
If I turn away from you

Oh Daddy don't turn away
You know that I'm so scared
But will you watch me drown?
You know we're going nowhere
We know that we're young
And no shit we're confused
But will you watch us drown?
What are you so afraid to lose?

Down on my knees
Begging us please
Praying that we don't exist
You're down on your knees
Begging us please
Praying that we don't exist

But we exist
We exist
We exist
We exist
Maybe if you hang together
You can make the changes in our hearts
And if you hang together, you can change us
Just where should you start?

// Flashbulb Eyes //

[Verse]
What if the camera
Really do
Take your soul
Oh no
What if the camera
Really do
Take your soul
Oh no

[Chorus]
Hit me with your flashbulb eyes!
Hit me with your flashbulb eyes!
You know I've got nothing to hide
You know I got nothing
No I got... nothing

[Verse]

[Chorus x2]

// Here Comes The Night Time //

When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down you head inside
'Cause the lights don't work
Yeah nothing works they say you don't mind
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time

And the missionaries
They tell us we will be left behind
Been left behind
A thousand times, a thousand times

If you want to be righteous
If you want to be righteous, get in line
'Cause here comes the night time

Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night
Here comes the night time
Look out, here comes the night time!

They say, heaven's a place
Yeah, heaven's a place and they know where it is
But you know where it is?
It's behind the gate, they won't let you in
And when they hear the beat, coming from the street, they lock the door
But if there's no music up in heaven, then what's it for?

When I hear the beat, my spirit's on me like a live-wire
A thousand horses running wild in a city on fire
But it starts in your feet, then it goes to your head
If you can't feel it, then the roots are dead
And if you're the judge, then what is our crime?
Here comes the night time

Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time

Here comes the night!
Here comes the night!
Look out, here comes the night!
Here comes the night!
Here comes the night!
Here comes the night, the night, the night, the night time!

Now the preachers they talk
Up on the satellite
If you're looking for Hell, just try looking inside

Here comes the night time, the night time
Here comes the night time, the night time
Here comes the night time, the night time
Here comes the night time, the night time
Here comes the night time, the night time

When you look in the sky, just try looking inside
God knows what you might find
When you look in the sky, just try looking inside
God knows what you might find
Here comes the night time

// Normal Person //

Oh man
Do you like Rock and Roll music?
'Cause I don't know if I do

Is anything as strange as a normal person?
Is anyone as cruel as a normal person?
Waiting after school for you
They want to know if you
If you're normal too
Well, are you?
Are you?

I'm so confused. Am I a normal person?
You know, I can't tell if I'm a normal person
It's true, I think I'm cool enough, but am I cruel enough?
Am I cruel enough for you?

And they will break you down
Till everything is normal now
I know
And they will break you down
Till everything is normal now
I know

They take their tea at two
All the normal people, they do
They burn the jungle down
While they were sleeping, it grew
You dream in English now
In proper English, look how
You're just the same as me
It's through

And they will break you down
Till everything is normal now
I know
And they will break you down
Till everyone is normal now
I know

If that's what's normal now
I don't want to know
If that's what's normal now
Mama don't make me go

When they get excited, they try to hide it
Look at those normals go
When they get excited, they try to hide it
Look at those normals go
When they get excited, they try to hide it
Look at those normals go
When they get excited, they try to hide it... No!

And they will break you down
Till everything is normal now
I know
And they will break you down
Till everyone is normal now
I know

If that's what's normal now
I don't want to know
If that's what's normal now

Maybe if you hang together
You can make the changes in our hearts
And if you hang together
You can change us, just where should you start?

I've never really ever met a normal person
I've never really ever met a normal person
I've never really ever met a normal person
I've never really ever met a normal person... like you!
How do you do?
How do you do?

// You Already Know //

[Intro sample]
Arcade Fire!

[Verse 1]
Sometimes it moves so fast
Sometimes it moves so fast
If you stop to ask
It's already passed
So how can you move so slow?
How can you move so slow?
You miss it if you don't
You miss it if you

[Chorus]
Don't already know
Already know
Already know
Already know
Already know

[Verse 2]
When your love is right
When your love is right
You can't sleep at night
You've been sleeping just fine
But when your love is bad
When your love is bad
I don't know why you're so sad
But it's time to go

[Chorus]
You already know
Already know
You already know
You already know
You already know
You already know
Already know

[Verse 3]
Sometimes it moves so fast
Sometimes it moves so fast
If you stop to ask
It's already passed
So how can you move so slow?
How can you move so slow?
You missed it, you know
You missed it

[Chorus]
You already know
Already know
You already know
You already know

[Bridge]
Please stop wondering why you feel so bad
When you already know
(Already know)
Please stop wondering why you feel so sad
When you already know
(Already know)
Please stop wondering why you feel so bad
When you already know
(Already know)
Please stop wondering why you feel so sad
When you already know
(Already know)

[Outro]
You already know
Oh, it's time to go

She said
"Well how do I know
When I know
When I know?"
(You already know)

Well then he said
"Well how do I know
When I know
When I know?"
(You already know)

She said
"Well how do I know
When I know
When I know?"...

[Outro sample]
Haha, haha
Arcade Fire, ladies and gentlemen!

// Joan Of Arc //

You're the one that they used to hate
But they like you now
And everything that goes away
Will be returned somehow
They're the ones that spit on you
Cause they got no heart
I'm the one that will follow you
You're my Joan of Arc

Joan of Arc

You had a vision they couldn't see so
They put you down
But everything that you said would happen
It came around
And they're the ones that put you down
Cause they got no heart
But I'm the one that will follow you
You're my Joan of Arc

[Chorus 1]
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc)
Tell the boys their time is through
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
Tell the boys I'll follow you
I'll follow you

Now they tell you that you're their muse
Yeah, they're so inspired
But where were they when they called your name
And they lit the fire?
When the voices came, you cut your hair
But you're still confused
But I'm the one with a heavy heart
Cause I'll follow you

[Chorus 2]
My Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
Tell the boys their time is through
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
Tell the boys I'll follow you
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
When the boys are over you
Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, ah ooh)
Tell the boys I'll follow you
I'll follow you

I really wanna know you

[Regine Chassagne]
Tu dis que tu es mon juge
Mais je ne te crois pas
Alors tu dis que je suis une sainte
Mais ce n'est pas moi
J'entends des voix
Mais ce n'est pas moi
Je ne suis pas Jeanne d'Arc
And if you shoot you better hit your mark

[Chorus 2]

Joan, it's true
I only wanna know you
Joan, it's true, it's true
I only wanna know you
But Joan
I only wanna know you

First they love you
Then they kill you
Then they love you again
And then they love you
Then they kill you
Then they love you again
Love love love you
Kill kill kill you
And then they love you again
They love love love you
Kill kill kill you
And then they love you again

// Here Comes The Night Time II //

Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time

I hurt myself again
Along with all my friends
Feels like it never ends
Here comes the night again

Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time

You hurt yourself again
Along with all your friends
Feels like it never ends
Here comes the night again

Here comes the night time 
Coming on slow
Here comes the night time
I know that you know

Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time

I hurt myself again
Along with all my friends
Feels like it never ends
Here comes the night again

Here comes the night time 
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night time
Here comes the night

// Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice) //

You and I were born in a little town
Before the awful sound started coming down
Oh no, oh

You came home from school and knew you had to run
Please stop running now, just let me be the one for you
I know you can see things that we can't see
But when I say I love you, your silence covers me
Oh, Eurydice, it's an awful sound

I was so disappointed you didn't want me
Oh, how could it be, Eurydice?
I was standing beside you by a frozen sea
Will you ever get free?

Just take all your pain, just put it on me
So that you can breathe
When you fly away will you hit the ground?
It's an awful sound

I know there's a way, we can make them pay
Think it over and say, "I'm never going back again"
I know there's a way, we can leave today
Think it over and say, "I'm never going back again"

You were born in the little town
Before the awful sound started coming down
There's so much inside you that you won't let me see
You fly away from me, but it's an awful sound when you hit the ground
It's an awful sound when you hit the ground

I know there's a way, we can make them pay
Think it over and say, "I'm never going back again"
I know there's a way, we can leave today
Think it over

We know there's a price to pay for love in a reflective age
I met you up upon a stage, our love in a reflective age
Oh no, now you're gone

// It's Never Over (Oh Orpheus) //

Hey, Orpheus!
I'm behind you
Don't turn around
I can find you

Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through
And if I call for you
Oh, Orpheus!
Just sing for me all night
We'll wait until it's over
Wait until it's through

You say it's not me, it's you

Hey, Orpheus!
De l'autre côté de l'eau
Comme un écho
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through

And if I shout for you
Never doubt
Don't turn around too soon
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through

It seems so important now
But you will get over
It seems so important now
But you will get over
And when you get over
When you get older
Then you will remember
Why it was so important then

Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
When you get over
And when you get older
Then you will discover
That it's never over

Hey, Eurydice!
Can you see me?
I will sing your name
Till you're sick of me
Just wait until it's over
Just wait until it's through

But if you call for me
This frozen sea
It melts beneath me
Just wait until it's over
Wait until it's through

Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
Seems like a big deal now
But you will get over
And when you get over
And when you get older
Then you will remember

He told you he'd wake you up
When it was over
He told you he'd wake you up
When it was over
Now that it's over
Now that you're older
Then you will discover
That it's never over

It's never over (it's never over) [8x]

Sometime (Sometime)
Sometime (Sometime)
Boy, they're gonna eat you alive (eat you alive)
But it's never gonna happen now
We'll figure it out somehow

Sometime (Sometime)
Sometime (Sometime)
Boy, they're gonna eat you alive (eat you alive)
But it's never gonna happen now
We'll figure it out somehow

Cause it's never over
It's never over (it's never over) [6x]

We stood beside
A frozen sea
I saw you out
In front of me
Reflected light
A hollow moon
Oh Orpheus, Eurydice
It's over too soon

// Porno //

Take the makeup off your eyes
I've got to see you, hear your sacred sighs
Before the break up, comes the silence
I'm talking to you. You say you're over it,
But I know

I thought I knew you. You thought you knew me
But now that you do, it's not so easy now
That I know

You can cry; I won't go. You can scream; I won't go
Every man that you know would have run at the word go
Little boys with their porno, oh, I know they hurt you so
They don't know what we know. Never know what we know

And all your makeup, just take it all off
I've got to find you before the line is lost
I know I hurt you, I won't deny it
When I reach for you, you say, "I'm over it."
But I know

You can cry; I won't go. You can scream; I won't go
Every man that you know would have run at the word go
Little boys with their porno, oh, I know they hurt you so
They don't know what I know. It's so little that we know
But the cup it overflows. Little boys with their porno
This is their world, where can we go?

Makes me feel like something's wrong with me
Makes me feel like something's wrong with me
Can you see me?

You can cry; I won't go. You can scream; I won't go
Little boys with their porno. Little boys with their porno
Makes me feel like something's wrong. It's the only world we know
Yeah, something's wrong. Little boys with their porno

And boys they learn some selfish shit until the girl won't put up with it
On and on and on we go. I just have to know. I'm not over it
I'm not over it

So love is real like a disease. 
Come on tell me please, 
I'm not over it
I'm not over it

// Afterlife //

Afterlife
Oh my God, what an awful word
After all the breath and the dirt and the fires are burnt
And after all this time, and after all the ambulances go
And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on in the dead lights
Of the afterglow

I've gotta know...

Can we work it out?
If we scream and shout, 'till we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout till we work it out
Till we work it out, till we work it out
Till we work it out, till we work it out

Afterlife
I think I saw what happens next
Oh, it was just a glimpse of you, like looking through a window
Or a shallow sea
Could you see me?
And after all this time
It's like nothing else we used to know
And after all the hangers-on are done hanging on in the dead lights
Of the afterglow

I've gotta know...

Can we work it out?
If we scream and shout, till we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout till we work it out?

But you say, "Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?"
And you say,
"Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?"
And where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?
Where do we go?

And after this
Can it last another night?
After all the bad advice
That had nothing at all to do with life

I've gotta know...

Can we work it out?
If we scream and shout, till we work it out
Can we just work it out?
Scream and shout till we work it out?

But you say,
"Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?"
And you say,
"Oh, when love is gone
Where does it go?"
We know it's gone
But where did it go?
And where do we go?

Is this the afterlife?
It's just an afterlife with you.
It's just an afterlife.
It's just an afterlife.
It's just an afterlife with you.
It's just an afterlife.
It's just an afterlife.

// Apocrypha //

I said I wanna be born
Born again
But not right now

Please don't take me there
But God said,
Son, it's time to go
But when you'll return 
I don't know just yet

But even stars they die when they get old
The precious ones that we used to hold
So if you gonna shoot you better hit your mark
Send that arrow,
Sent it through my heart
My heart

You said,
This time, I won't get turned away
This time, I won't get turned away
This time, I won't get turned away

You said

Well, Joan of Arc
I walk in the dark
She said,
I've seen how the world ends
First they love you
Then they kill you
Then they'll love you again, and again
Again

She said,
This time, I won't get turned away
This time, I won't get turned away
This time, I won't get turned away
[Repeat]

But Jesus Christ
What did you do
To deserve what they done to you?
[Repeat]

We're coming downtown
See what we got
We got the right

We know something ain't right
We know something ain't right

Going downtown
See what we got
We got the right

// Women Of A Certain Age //

Women of a certain age
Made to feel they gotta change
Some of them change their faces
But they don't smile the same
Some of them take night courses
Some of them get divorces
As the world gets strange
It's time for a change

Go and let your men get strange markings
Go and let the world get strange
Never change

Women own the world tonight
'Cause all the boys, they just wanna fight
And women of the world are born
To all the boys little wars
Mother, sister, daughter
The boys, they just can't father
It's time to take the ranks
When it's away from the strange

Go and let your men get strange markings
Go and let the world get strange
But never change
Never change
Never change

// Soft Power //

Soft power got them so upset.
They think it's over.
But it's not done yet.

Soft power in the underground
Gonna let the wind
Blow the shit all around.

Well,
Soft power gets into our brains
Soft power now it's never going to be the same
All your voices in the streets tonight
Soft power
It's alright

All your power makes the world go round
You can cut the speakers
You can cut all the sounds.
But can you hear us
Singing our song?
Soft power
Now it's coming on strong

Soft power gets into our brains
Soft power now it's never going to be the same
All your voices in the streets tonight
Soft power
It's alright

Soft power
Look at them go
Soft power
They're about to explode
Soft power
In the Underworld
Soft power
Every boy and girl

We were born
So it's our right
You can cut all the power
You can cut all the lights
But we can see you even in the dark
Your words are fire
And we are the spark

Well
Soft power gets into our brains
Soft power now it's never, ever going to be the same
All your voices in the streets tonight
Soft power
It's not alright

Soft power
Look at them go
Soft power
They're about to explode
Soft power
In the Underworld
Soft power
Every boy and girl

Call a doctor
when it's not alright

Call a doctor
Cause it's not alright

Call a doctor
It's not alright

Call a doctor
Cause it's not alright

Well.

We'd love to help you
But we're not home.
Leave a message:
It's impossible now.

We'd love to help you
But we're not home.
Leave a message:

We'd love to help you
But we're not home.
Leave a message:

// Get Right //

Better get right
Before you die
Better get right
[3x]

'Cause you can't take it down with you
Where you're going to
No, you can't take it down with you
Where you're going to

And forever (ever) is longer than you could ever
Yeah, forever (ever) is longer than you could ever
Imagine

Better get right (right)
Better get right (right)

// Crucified Again //

On the twelfth of January
You don't need what you can't carry
The blood will flow into the ocean
The voices breaking with the motion

Crucified
Then crucified again
Crucified
Then crucified again

In the night, they started singin'
They had no right to keep believin'
But down bellow, there's someone screamin'
A broken church, no bells a-ringin'

They crucified
Then crucified again
They crucified
Then crucified again

Crucified again
Crucified again

The preachers talk on television
Hand out the judgments of their religion
But when I heard those women singin'
They made a sound I couldn't believe in

Crucified
Then crucified again

He who strikes the blow forgets it
But he who bears the scar remembers
The fire is burnin' down to embers
The fire is burnin', but I can't remember

Crucified
Then crucified again
Crucified
Then crucified again

Crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again, and again, and again

All you great and mighty nations
Who think you've payed for your high stations
The cities may be built in the sand
But ours were built by their fathers' hands

They crucified
Then crucified again
They crucified
Then crucified again

Crucified again
Crucified again
Crucified again, and again, and again

Till the crowd cries
Do it again
[Repeat]

Crucified again
Crucified again
