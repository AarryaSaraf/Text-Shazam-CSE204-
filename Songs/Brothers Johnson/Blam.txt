// So Won't You Stay //

Two together, love forever
That's how it should be

One so lonely, two's the only way to be
Won't you stay with me
Fulfill my fantasy

Love's the season
You're the reason
I feel ours is real

Time will measure
All the pleasure
Don't be shy
Oh how time can fly
Let's not say goodbye

So won't you stay
Together we'll find a way
So baby won't you stay
Don't give all your love away
To the world 'cause they could never feel
The tenderness of all your love
Like I do
Won't you stay with me
I need you baby

So won't you stay
Together we'll find a way
So baby won't you stay
Don't give all your love away
To the world 'cause they could never feel
The tenderness of all your love
Like I do
Won't you stay with me
You belong to me
Won't you stay with me

// Blam! //

Well well well well
Well well well well, hey

You shake me to my knees
And you knock me off my feet
When I see you coming
Got so much style in your strut
Can't keep my eyes off you know what
When you're walking

Oh, how I want you so badly, right now
Oh, how I need you so badly, right now

Have some mercy

Your sexy ways are all I see
You stir up all my energy
Girl I'm ready
I can hear your body talk
You're the prey I want to stalk
Foxy lady

Girl, I could please you
If I had you right now
Girl I could squeeze you
If I had you right now

Oh, how I want you so badly, right now
Oh, how I need you so badly, right now

You shake me to my knees
And you knock me off my feet
When I see you coming
Got so much style in your strut
Can't keep my eyes off you know what
When you're walking

// Ride-O-Rocket //

Ride-o-rocket
Ride-o-rocket

If we get to Jupiter
We'll be on the right course
Past the satellite
We're bound to meet the force

And we'll beam, we'll beam, we'll beam, we'll beam
Shaka!
How high
Where is infinity?
Where lies the mystery

Dilliup, dilliup, dilliup, dilliup
Ride-o-rocket
Oh, yeah, do it, do it, do it, do it
Ride-o-rocket
Aw, come on

Neptune is the place
That I know nothing of
So take me to Venus
She's the goddess of love

And we'll beam, we'll beam, we'll beam
I'll make you scream
Shaka!
How far
Must we go past the sun
Are we the only ones

Dilliup, dilliup, dilliup, dilliup
Ride-o-rocket
Oh, take me to it, take me to it
Ride-o-rocket
Oh, ride, rid, ride, ride
Ride-o-rocket

Ride-o-rocket
Won't you do it, do it, do it, do it
Ride, ride, ride
Won't you
Ride, ride, ride
Yeah
Ride, ride, ride

How far
Must we go past the sun
Are we the only ones

Dilliup, dilliup, dilliup, dilliup
Ride-o-rocket

// It's You Girl //

We talk about it every day
Seems your love don't wanna come my way
I've been wrong so long
And played little games
Just can't believe I could ever change

But I will for you and me, you'll see
Just let our love grow naturally
My words go round and round and upside down
I don't care
I don't care who knows it

'Cause it's you girl and you know it
Me and you girl
We've got a good thing goin'
It's you girl and you know it
Me and you girl
We've got a good thing goin'

Don't pay no mind to what folks say
This time it's up to me, this time I'm gonna stay
I used to roam without reason, I would roam
And now with you, my love has found a home

So trust me baby and you'll see
Just let our love grow naturally
My words go round and round and upside down
I don't care
I don't care who knows it

'Cause it's you girl and you know it
Me and you girl
We've got a good thing goin'
It's you girl and you know it
Me and you girl
We've got a good thing goin'
