// Sweet Dreams //

Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why cant I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you.

You don't love me its plain
I should know you'll never wear my ring
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you.

Sweet dreams of you
Things I know can't come true 
Why cant I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you...

// Window Up Above //

I've been living a new way
Of life that I love so
But I can see the clouds are gath'ring
And the storm will wreck our home
For last night he held you tightly
And you didn't even shove
This is true for I've been watching
From the window up above.

You must have thought that I was sleeping
And I wish that I had been
But I guess it's best to know you
And the way your heart can sin
I thought we belonged together
And our hearts fit like a glove
I was wrong for I've been watching
From the window up above.

From my eyes the teardrops started
As I listened on and on
I heard you whisper to him softly
That our marriage was all wrong
But I hope he makes you happy
And you will never lose his love
I was wrong, I was watching
From the window up above.

How I wish I could be dreaming
And wake up to an honest love
I was wrong for I was watching
From the window up above...
