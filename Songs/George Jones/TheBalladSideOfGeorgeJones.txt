// One Is A Lonely Number //

One is a lonely number
One can never have fun
When I met you
I thought I lost the blues
But now I find that I'm back in
That same old boat again.
One is an unhappy number
Why do you always make me wait
One and one makes two
That's why I need you
One is a lonely, lonely number.
One is a lonely number
One is always on it's own
When I met you
I thought I lost the blues
Now I find that I'm back in
That same old boat again.
One is an unhappy number
So why do you always make me wait
One and one makes two
That's why I need you
One is a lonely, lonely number...
