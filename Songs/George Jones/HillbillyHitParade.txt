// Hold Everything //

Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone
Don't be tempted by their money and booze
Nobody's gonna fill my shoes.
When I get back I won't even knock
'Cause the same ole keys fits the same ole locks
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone.
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone
Don't try to sell our little shack
Just keep it till I get back.
Just keep everything in apple shape
If you feel to quessy put on the brake
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone.
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone
Just meet 'em at the door with a 44
And tell 'em I'm right next door.
If they ask you for a date just show 'em they gate
And if they don't like it tell them your to late
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone.
Hold everything I'm a-comin' home
No matter how far I roam
When I return we're gonna be alone
You'll forget I've ever been gone.
When I get back you won't sleep
And you won't have much time to eat
Hold everything till I come home
No matter how long I'm gone...

// You Gotta Be My Baby //

Oh, you said you wes my baby 
Now I know that you're my baby
But it seems to me you got rovin' eye
If you wanna be my baby 
Then you gotta be my baby
You can't keep your finger in two different fire.

I remember how you pleaded 
When you told me that you needed
My lovin' I believe it without a doubt
So if you wanna be my baby 
Then you gotta be my baby
And you gotta leave 'em kissin' cousins out.

Oh, when you're high steppin' I'm a crawlin' low
I get suspicious and I'm a gonna tell you so
If you wanna be my baby 
Then you gotta be my baby
And be nobody's baby but mine.

Now I heard there was another 
So I went and asked your mother
If anybody hung around 'sides me
She gave me no satisfaction 
So now I can't take no action
But I think that I'll just hang around and see.

If you wanna be my baby 
Then you gotta be my baby
And you gotta come to me and tell me so
If you're gonna be my baby 
Then you gotta be my baby
I'm tired of waitin' round so let me know.

Oh, when you're high steppin' I'm a crawlin' low
I get suspicious and I'm a gonna tell you so
If you wanna be my baby 
Then you gotta be my baby
And be nobody's baby but mine.

You've gotta be nobody's baby but mine...

// Crazy Arms //

Now blue, ain't the word for the way that I feel
And the storm's are brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream, I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now, you're not mine.

Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
For my yearning heart keeps saying, you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon, to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time.

So please take the treasured dreams I had for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Some day my crazy arms may hold somebody new
But now I'm so lonely all the time.

Oh, Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
For my yearning heart keeps saying, you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon, to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time...

// Satisfied Mind //

How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I could do things my way
But little they know that's so hard to find 
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
Once I was waiting in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game
But suddenly it happened I lost every dime 
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind
Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times 
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind
When my life's ended and my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave there's no doubt
But one thing for certain when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

// You Are The One //

You are the one, you're the one in my heart
You're my darling, my life's greatest thrill
You are the one in my heart and I know
That I love you and I always will.

I've had some sweethearts and dear so have you
And I've done somethings I know I shouldn't do
We tasted life both the bitter and the sweet
It helps us to know love when we get to meet.

You are the one, you're the one in my heart
You're my darling, my life's greatest thrill
You are the one in my heart and I know
That I love you and I always will.

We pay for our future with the tears from the past
It helps us know when we've found love at last
I didn't know what joy was till I've been through
I didn't know what love was till I met you.

You are the one, you're the one in my heart
You're my darling, my life's greatest thrill
You are the one in my heart
And I know that I love you and I always will

// Searching //

Searching I've spent a lifetime darling
Searching looking for someone like you
Dreaming in all my dreams I dream that someday
I'd find someone like you
Other loves have come my way but they were not for me
Tell me that you're here to stay don't ever set me free
Cause I've been searching I've spent a lifetime darling searching
Looking for someone just like you
Other loves have come my way...

// I Take The Chance //

I'll take the chance
To lose my soul, my life, my pride
I'll take the chance
To be with you.

I tried to live
My life the best I can
I prayed I'd never cheat
To heed
My hearts command

But did you know
You are my tried and true?
I wonder if you think
I'd do the same by you

I'll take the chance
Of causing you to doubt my love
I'll take the chance
To be with you.

I know it's wrong
For us to
And when you hold me in
Your arms I can't resist.

I have a home
And some one tried and true
I know I'll lose it all
If I would dream of you.

I'll take the chance
To lose my soul, my life, my pride
I'll take the chance
To be with you...

// Blackboard Of My Heart //

When I was young and went to school they taught me how to write
To take the chalk and make a mark and hope it turns out right
Well that's the way it is with love and what you did to me
I wrote it so you'd know that I was yours eternally

But my tears have washed I love you from the blackboard of my heart
It's too late to clean the slate and make another start
I'm satisfied the way things are although we're far apart
My tears have washed I love you from the blackboard of my heart

If you'd been true the way you should and not have gone astray
These tears would not have fallen down and washed the words away
No need to talk, cause if the chalk should write those words again
It will be for someone else not things that might have been

But my tears have washed I love you from the blackboard of my heart
It's too late to clean the slate and make another start
I'm satisfied the way things are although we're far apart
My tears have washed I love you from the blackboard of my heart...
