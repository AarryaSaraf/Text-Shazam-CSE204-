// Everything Sucks //

Got up this morning to make some coffee.
Everything sucks today.
Prayed someone hired a hitman to off me.
Everything sucks today.

Got up on the wrong side of life this morning.
Nothin' today is gonna go my way. 
Horoscope told me lies this morning.
I don't think anything's gonna be okay. 

Today! 
Everything sucks today! 
Everything sucks today!
Everything sucks today!

Right girl didn't call, and the wrong one's knocking. 
Everything sucks today. 
Flat tire on my car, so I guess I'm walking. 
Everything sucks today. 

Taxman came and took my money. 
Now, all my other bills are gonna be late.
My girlfriend's moving in this morning.
I don't think anything's gonna be okay. 

Today! 
Everything sucks today! 
Everything sucks today!
Everything sucks today!

Got up on the wrong side of life this morning.
Nothin' today is gonna go my way. 
Horoscope told me lies this morning.
I don't think anything's gonna be okay. 

Today! 
Everything sucks today! 
Everything sucks today!
Everything sucks today!

// I'm The One //

I'm the one; I've been here for you all along.
I'm the one whose shoulder you've been cryin' on.

Nice guys finish last-no one knows as good as me.
We're just good friends, and you come to me for sympathy.

You tell me that I'm not your type,
But still you call me late at night
Every time he picks a fight.
After all he's said and all he's done-

I'm the one; I've been here for you all along.
I'm the one whose shoulder you've been cryin' on.

He's a total dick; that's the truth, and you know I'm right.
From everything you say, there's no way he'll ever do you right.

You love a man who treats you wrong.
You think you'll change him, but you're wrong.
He'll use you; then, he'll say, "So long."
After all he's said and all he's done-

I'm the one; I've been here for you all along.
I'm the one whose shoulder you've been cryin' on.

I'm the one who wants you more than anything;
You don't feel the same way-you've made it clear to me,
But I'll stand my ground and maybe
You'll hear what I've been sayin'.

After all I've said and all I've done-

I'm the one; I've been here for you all along.
I'm the one whose shoulder you've been cryin' on.
I'm the one; I've been here for you all along.
I'm the one whose shoulder you've been cryin' on.

I'm the one.

// Coffee Mug //

Mug mug mug

Coffee mug
Gonna clear away the haze
Liquid proof
That I can win this race
Coffee mug
The grip that keeps me tall
My inter-link
Keeps me questing all

I don't need no booze or drugs
I just chug-a-lug-o my coffee mug
And I don't need your kiss and hug
I just chug-a-lug-o my coffee mug

They haven't banned
My liquid drug of choice
There's too many hooked
And they've got too much voice
So for the moment
We're all pretty good to go
With 98 cups
With 98 more to go

I don't need no booze or drugs
I just chug-a-lug-o my coffee mug
And I don't need your kiss and hug
I just chug-a-lug-o my coffee mug

Here a bean, there a bean
Everywhere a mean mean
Bean chug-a-lug-o my coffee mug mug mug mug

// Rotting Out //

Shove all your problems under the rug
Then you wonder where the smell came from
Rotting out from the inside

This is your fucked up family
So many minds that nobody ever speaks
Rotting out from the inside
Rotting out

Nuclear family falling out
Winter forever in this house, they're
Rotting out from the inside

So put me out of my misery
If it ever happens to me, no
Rotting out from the inside
Rotting out

Rotting out
Rotting out
Rotting out
Rotting out

Beat my head till I can't speak
Not gonna let it happen to me, no

Rotting out
Rotting out
Rotting out
Rotting out

// Sick-O-Me //

New love, new fun, new me
Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?
New fear, nothing's clear to me
And that's how it's always gonna be
I've never been real sure of myself
Never trusted someone else
Something you do puts my fears to rest

We'll bring it up and never touch the ground
And when you need me I'll be around
This is how it's gonna be
If you don't get Sick-O-Me

She loved me and I loved her
It was all so fun and new
We were going to go all over the world
And do everything there is to do
But something spoiled our plans
We couldn't meet our own demands
Every problem put us to the test

We brought it up but then we let it down
And when she needed me I wasn't around
That was how it had to be
Then she just got Sick-O-Me

Relationships deteriorate
I've seen it from the start
Easy as it is to fall in love
It's easier to fall apart
I won't let it fall apart

Bring it up and never touch the ground
And when you need me I'll be around
This is how it's gonna be
If you don't get Sick-O-Me

We'll hold it up and never let it down
And when you need me I'll be around
This is how it's gotta be
So you don't get Sick-O-Me
So you don't get Sick-O-Me
So you don't get Sick-O-Me

// Caught //

Hear about the president?
He used to smoke pot
He never broke the law
Cause he never got caught

It's a sign of the times, it's the ultimate crime
Guilty of being caught red handed
The roll of the dice says your gonna do time
Guilty of being caught red handed

Junkie drug dealer does 50 years time
While the millionaire murderer just pays a fine

It's a sign of the times, it's the ultimate crime
Guilty of being caught red handed
The roll of the dice says your gonna do time
Guilty of being caught red handed

I'll pretend not to see
What you pretend you don't do
I'm innocent like you

So many stupid laws gonna have to break a few
Speed or run a red light i might too
When the man pulls you over like it or not
You're just one of the many
Only you got caught

It's a sign of the times, it's the ultimate crime
Guilty of being caught red handed
The roll of the dice says your gonna do time
Guilty of being caught red handed

I'll pretend not to see
What you pretend you don't do
I'm innocent

It's a sign of the times, it's the ultimate crime
Guilty of being caught red handed
The roll of the dice says your gonna do time
Guilty of being caught red handed

// When I Get Old //

What will it be like when I get old

Will I still hop on my bike, and ride around town
Will I still want to be someone, and not just sit around
I don't want to be like other adults 'cause they've already died
Cool and condescending, fossilized

Will I be rich, will I be poor
Or will I still sleep on the floor
What will it be like when I get
What will I be like when I get
What will it be like when I get old

Will I still kiss my girlfriend and try to grab her ass
Will I still hate the cops and have no class
Will all my grown up friends say they've seen it all before
They say hey act your age and I'm immature

Will I do myself proud
Or only what's allowed
What will it be like when I get
What will I be like when I get
What will it be like when I get old

Will I sit around and talk about the old days
Sit around and watch T.V.
I never want to go that way
Never burn out not fade away

As I travel through my time
Will I like what I find
What will it be like when I get
What will I be like when I get
What will it be like when I get old

// Doghouse //

In the world of man in the great rat race
Makes his speeches then he does what he please
Winners of the mosh impart their grace
As I wallow in the mush in a doggy daze

I live in a kennel smells like rotten cheese
Chums lots of flies but why should I mind
Then I get trashed by the ho that's my wife
She can't get enough of kickin' my hiney

Life in the canine world
Cats to chase and a bone to bury
Full of doggy stench in this poo poo place
If I get a piece of tail I don't want to get married

This is just a doghouse why should I stay
If these folks are crazy
They try to tell me that they know where it's at
I don't know maybe I'm lazy

This is just a doghouse, you said I'm a dog
I live like a dog
This is my doghouse

So now it's time to go work for the man
I work for the man at the taco stand
I keep on grinding like a dog always does
No place to hide for this American dog

This is my doghouse, you said I'm a dog
I live like a dog
This is my doghouse

When I frickin' find what I'm lookin' for
I dig right in and take my place
Maybe I seem crass and crude
But a dog's gotta do what a dog has to do

This is my doghouse, you said I'm a dog
I live like a dog
This is my doghouse

I'm just a dog, I eat cat feces
Feel like a hydrant on this doggy street
I live in the doghouse, everybody hates me
I want to get laid, but everybody takes me

I'm your dog and you're bitches

// She Loves Me //

She loves me; it's not just in my head. 
She loves me even though it's not been said, 
And if anything means anything, then this means something good.
I guess I'd love her back if I only could. 

She loves me; I can see it when she smiles ear-to-ear. 
She loves me, and I'm sure that she can't hear 
How I scream out for someone else 
When I'm asleep or by myself,
How I'm so sad, I hate myself. 
I don't know where to go for help! 

Her love could never grow sour. 
It grows more pure with every hour. 
I never wanted anything like that from her. 

But still, she loves me; it's not just in my head. 
She loves me even though it's not been said, 
And if anything means anything, then this means something good.
I guess I'd love her back if I only could. 

She loves me, and I know she can accept me for myself. 
She loves me, but I'm sure that she can't help 
How I'm this close to cashing in, 
How I chase dreams that don't exist, 
How I hate girls and I hate my life, 
The pain-it rips me, tears me, ruins me! 

Her love could never grow sour. 
It grows more pure with every hour. 
I never wanted anything like that from her. 

But still, she loves me. 
(I don't have to be)
She loves me. 
(All by myself) 
She loves me. 
(She don't love no one else)
She loves me. 

The way she loves me. 
The way she loves me.

// Hateful Notebook //

The words she writes will change the world
She's much smarter than me
Inside she writes a side of herself
She won't let me see

Such a hateful little girl
Her little book is her whole world
It's all there in her little book
And I can't help but wonder
But she says I'll never understand

She says there's no love and everyone's out to get her
She keeps me shut out and I don't want to let her

Such a hateful little girl
Her little book is her whole world
It's all there in her little book
And I can't help but wonder
What chapter I fit under, yeah

I'm a stone age male and that's a fact
There's so much more to me than that

Such a hateful little girl
Her little book is her whole world
She's writing in her little book
She don't like me but she's got me hooked
And I can't help but wonder
What she's like between the covers
I can't help but wonder
What she's like between the covers
I can't help but wonder
What she's like between the covers, yeah

// We //

I don't care what they say
Those numbers don't mean a thing
We've got it made

This world is just me and you
And we know just what to do
We've got it made

Hey, everything's gonna be okay
(We've got it made together)
Hey, everything's gonna be okay
(We've got it made)

I don't care if we get a job
We've already got a life
We've got it made

I don't know what the future holds
All I know is you're there with me
That's all I need

Hey, everything's gonna be okay
(We've got it made together)
Hey, everything's gonna be okay
(We've got it made)

When I look in your eyes
I know what I want in life

Nothing more, nothing less
Nothing more, nothing less
(Everything's gonna be okay)

Nothing more, nothing less
(Everything's gonna be okay)
Be the key to my success
Nothing more, nothing less

// Eunuch Boy //

Eunuch boy, eunuch boy
Thought a lawnmower was another toy
Don't laugh at him cause he can't piss straight

He can't even masturbate
Got no gonads, only two sockets
Got no bulge in his pockets

Eunuch boy, eunuch boy
Thought a lawnmower was another toy
Can't even make it through a day of school

They try to stomp his shriveled little tool
It must suck to know you'll never fuck

// This Place //

This place sucks. 

I haven't found a single thing to call my own,
And there's nothin' left for me to do. 
Just play the game, pretend to do work. 
No, my boss isn't a jerk; it's just this place. 

This place sucks. 

I've been slinkin' through the halls like an unwashed dog,
And everybody treats me like a criminal,
Talk about me behind my back. 
At least I don't have a stick up my ass like the people in this place. 

This place sucks.
This place sucks. 
This place sucks. 

I feel my confidence draining away. 
I feel them laughing at me everyday. 
I never thought it would end up this way. 
Good thing I'm not gonna stay. 

This place sucks. 

I haven't found a single friend in three whole years 
'Cause there's nobody here but the Bible boys,
Talkin' 'bout their white bread politics. 
Gotta leave the room 'cause you're makin' me sick; gotta leave this place.

This place sucks.

// Thank You //

I listen to you for hours, I'll listen all day
Just keep hitting me the right way
Sing your song in the shower
Cause you got a way
To say what I can never say right - right on
When I feel weak you make me feel strong
Make me feel strong

I won't say your name
But you know who you are
I'll never be the same again now - no way
I just want to say
Thank you for playing the way you play

You don't get played on the radio
That's not the game you play
Well I don't care anyway
I glued your tape in the stereo
So I know every word, every note
And every chord is right - right on
When I feel weak you make me feel strong
Make me feel strong feel like nothing's wrong

I won't say your name
You know who you are
I'll never be the same again now - no way
I just want to say thank you for playing the
Way you play

Did you know you're why I go
And waste my time
At a rock and roll show
You let me know I'm not alone
You make me feel strong, make me feel strong,
Feel like nothing's wrong

I won't say your name, you know who you are
I'll never be the same again now - no way
I just want to say
Thank you for playing the way you play
Thank you for playing the way you play
Thank you for playing the way you play
