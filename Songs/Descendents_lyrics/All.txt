Album: All

// All //

All!

// Coolidge //

I'm not a cool guy anymore
As if I ever was before
I took a look at all the signs
They're rolling over in my mind

The feelings I could not release
Became a bitter part of me
What was I thinking of?
I couldn't stand the way it was

Looked at my reflection
And I saw a stranger's face
I saw where I was going
And I had to walk away

I lost a girl it's just as well
She tried to save me from myself
I still got her on my mind
Tossing and turning in my bed

But if she had stayed another week,
I would have dragged her down with me
She took off 'cause she had enough
Is that what I thought love was?

I told her "See you later"
But it's hard to see at all
At the bottom of the barrel
With your back against the wall

I'm not a cool guy anymore
Left it behind and closed the door
I know you can't escape the past
Now I look back and have to laugh

I was my worst enemy
It almost got the best of me
What was I thinking of?
I couldn't stand the way it was

I looked up one day and saw that
It was up to me
You can only be a victim if you
Admit defeat

// No! All! //

All? No, All!

// Van //

Here in my van I can beat my small cock
Fart on your face, sleep on a loaf
Here in my van I can piss in a cup
Do what I want, scrounge for some change
I can lose

Here in my van I can eat my small squid
Dance the can-can with my feet in the air
Here in my van I can play the last tape
Play my small uke, write stupid songs
Like this one...
Yeah, yeah like this one

Haven't slept in days but that's okay
Gonna let 'er eat
Cat pizza road apples coffee shun Vivarin
Have a little snack
Put in a quarter and play road rally
Driving down the dark corridor
Fall asleep and wake up in another place

Here in my van I can beat my small cock
Fart on your face, sleep on a loaf
Here in my van I can piss in a cup
Scrounge for some change, do what I want
I can lose

Here in my van I can hate everyone
Wait for no girls to call me in the middle of the night
Here in my van I can lose my small mind

// Cameage //

I'm looking straight down
I'm sick and I need a friend
I didn't know they came like that
I'm thinking things now
I thought I'd never think
I didn't know they came like that

You came so quickly
Right in and out of my life
I didn't know they came like that
Did I ever tell you
How much I love to hold you
I didn't know they came like that

It doesn't really matter if I live or die
The only thing that matters is you're by my side
There's no turning back from this one

I judged too quickly
I've never been good at trust
I didn't know they came like that
But did I ever tell you
How much I love to love you
I didn't know they came like that

It doesn't really matter if I live or die
The only thing that matters is you're by my side
There's no turning back from this one
No turning back from this one

It's not that I don't want your love
But I don't deserve anyone
I didn't know they came like that
I will return to you
When I am 32
I didn't know they came like that

You came so quickly
Right in and out of my life
I didn't know they came like that
Did I ever tell you
How much I love to love you
I didn't know they came like that

It doesn't really matter if I live or die
The only thing that matters is you're by my side
There's no turning back from this one
No turning back from this one

Did I ever tell you
How much I love to love you
I didn't know they came like that

// Impressions //

That could be me
That could be me
Walking along the Seine
Where I'd throw my glasses away

That could be us
That could be us
Walking through the garden

Watch the flowers melt together
Boats reflected in the river
The picture on my wall
Your picture in my wallet
Blurry and beyond
If I stare and stare
Maybe I'll be there

And we'd walk through
Breathe through
Open mouth

I don't care

And we'd walk through
Breathe through
Open mouth

What they'd say

// Iceman //

He's not alive
He can't dream
Stone cold monster
Thinking machine
Never feels
Anger or pain
What's left of his heart
Is inside his brain

Get down on your knees
Say pretty please
Or do you want to freeze?

The iceman cometh

My pretty pretty thing
Do you you want to freeze?

Born without a hug
Or an ounce of love
Doesn't know how much
He can hurt someone
Do you feel the chill
In his calculated prose?
His words will kill
If you leave yourself exposed

He is part of our generation
Let us mourn
It's too late to save this child
It started when he was born

The iceman cometh

Keep your distance
Don't get too close
A beautiful girl once made that mistake

She froze

The iceman cometh

He is part of our generation
Let us mourn

// Jealous Of The World //

Jealous of the world again
Don't even try to be my friend
Everything is wrong for me
And everything's right for them
I'm jealous of the world again
I represent the worst in man
Jealous of the world again

I'd like to interrupt you
Fuck you to everything you say
It's nothing personal, mind you
But either you or I should go away
So go away

Jealous of the world again
Don't even try to be my friend
Everything is wrong for me
And everything's right for them
I'm Jealous of the world again
Don't give a shit about your deadly sin
Jealous of the world again

You belong to a useless subset
The one that's not me
Don't try to define my problems
Or understand me
I'll trip you up, I'll flip you off
Pardon me
Don't wanna hear your voice
I think I'll fart on your face

And there's nothing I can do
No there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing you can do
I'll just stay away from you

I'd like to make a comment
Roll down the window and scream
I hate you cause I hate me
I gotta shake this disease

Jealous of the world again
Jealous of the world again
I'm jealous of the world again
And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing you can do
I'll just stay away from you

// Clean Sheets //

Clean sheets mean a lot to a guy who sleeps on the floor. 
I wanted your love and a shelf on your dresser drawer. 
You tucked me in, stopped my tossin' and turnin',
But I turned back the covers, and I saw those sheets are dirty.

Even though you'll never come clean, you know it's true.
Those sheets are dirty, and so are you. 

The warmth of a bed to a guy who sleeps on the floor
Was enough to perpetuate all the lies I heard before,
And now I wanna hold you, gotta hold my pillow instead,
'Cause my pillow will never lie, or be with a stranger in my bed.

Even though you'll never come clean, you know it's true.
Those sheets are dirty, and so are you. 

Where's the love I was lookin' for? It's out the door. 
I'm afraid to see you anymore, so it's back on the floor,
'Cause those sheets are dirty. 

[Guitar solo]

Woke up this mornin', alone on the floor,
Thinkin' about those clean sheets and the way it was before. 
When I looked in the mirror, I saw your face and thought of the past, 
But now I know how dirty you are-took my fist and smashed the glass!

Even though you'll never come clean, you know it's true.
Those sheets are dirty, and so are you. 

Even though you'll never come clean, you know it's true.
Those sheets are dirty, and so are you. 

Those sheets are dirty.
Those sheets are dirty. 
Those sheets are dirty.

// Pep Talk //

It's not the end of the world
Since your baby left you
It's gonna be okay
You don't need her anyway

You're looking around for someone to love
So you don't have to face the world alone
But give it some time and you might find
That you're better off on your own
Cause you could be dead right now
You could be the stupidest thing in the world
But you're not, look at what you've got
And stop thinking about that girl

You deserve the best, but it's up to you to get it
Don't settle for less, you know you're gonna regret it

It's not the end of the world
Since your baby left you
It's gonna be okay
You don't need her anyway

Watching the tube, moping around
Might as well be six feet underground
You're watching the game go by
Waiting for the final score
You got the beer commercials memorized
So you've probably heard this before
But this ain't the TV talking to you
It's a friend who's gonna tell you what you can do

You deserve the best, but it's up to you to get it
Don't settle for less, you're the best and don't you forget it

I know what you're thinking... you'll never find another
And even if you did, well, you couldn't love her
But out there somewhere is the person, place or thing
That you need to make you believe in you

It's not the end of the world
Since your baby left you
It's gonna be okay
You can find something better anyway

Just take your time. and you will find
What your life requires
Just take your time. and you will find
What your heart desires
Just take your time. and you will find
You will find

// Schizophrenia //

It's dark outside, I'm riding alone
But I know the road
Can't even see ahead of my nose
But I know the road
A little scared, but I know where to go
Cuz I know the road
I can do it by feel, take it real slow
I know the road

Hold on
Hold on
A fork in the road
Life in transition
Hold on
Hold on
Moving too fast
In the wrong direction
Hold on
Hold on
Gotta feel the road
Know my position

Break the speakers
Crack the books
Over you shoulder
Not another look
Burn off the shackles
Of a wooden past
Melt through the ice
Be free at last
Dare to be stupid
Dare to smell
You can be crazy
You can be hell
The end result
Is always the same
Whichever you choose
You lose
You're insane

Granite poured into my veins
Black hole explodes in my brain
The accident is to blame

You say you're going insane
Say it like you mean it, man
I wish I could, but I can't

You say that life is a pain
It isn't for me, man
I don't feel anything at all

Shield myself from the world
Hold everything inside
Fold my arms across my chest

Shield the world from myself
Make sure the sleeves are tied
Wrap my arms across my chest

Death is my life
Life is my Death
Lay my arms across my chest

I know the road
I know where it goes
I know the road
I know where it goes
Don't tell me what I already know
I know where it goes
That's why I'm going so slow
