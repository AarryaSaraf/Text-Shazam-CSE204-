// Descendents //

Just because we've gone away
Here's a message from me and Ray
We're not gonna let the music die
Join us if you've got the energy

We're the proud, the few
Descendents rockin' alone tonight
We're the proud, the few
Descendents pickin' our butts tonight

We're looking for a few good men
Degenerates need not apply
Attitude is a must
On our endless quest
To play hard, play fast
You must sacrifice (Aaah)
Nothing else will suffice
Pay the price

We never did a popular thing
Don't even know how to sing
Couldn't sell out a telephone booth
What I'm telling you is the truth

We're the proud, the few
Descendents rockin' alone tonight
We're the proud, the few
Descendents pickin' our butts tonight

We're looking for a few good men
Degenerates need not apply
Attitude is a must
On our endless quest
To play hard, play fast
You must sacrifice (Aaah)
Nothing else will suffice
Pay the price

// I Don't Want To Grow Up //

I don't want to grow up
I don't want to grow up

If growing up means being like you
Then I don't want to be like you
Recycled trash it's deja vu

I don't want to grow up
I don't want to grow up

You're grown up, told what to do
Your suit can't hide the truth
You're a fool and I refuse to be like you

I don't want to grow up
I don't want to grow up

// Pervert //

Don't you think it's time I let you know
Don't you think I should before you go
I'm not gonna let you get away
I want to fuck you night and day

I'm a pervert

I like to go out on dates
See a movie, communicate
We'll go home and have some fun
I'll tell you, sure you're the only one

Then when I leave your house I smell of sex
Then I know I'm a pervert because I like it
And I know I'm perverted because I want it

Want it all of the time
Want it all of the time
Want it all of the time
Want it all of the time

Don't you sometimes wonder what I want
Don't you sometimes think I just want your cunt
I'd hate to think that romance is just a pose
But all I want to do is rip off your clothes

I'm a pervert

I like to hold you in my arms
You know I wouldn't do you harm
I never take advantage in my book that's a sin
But somehow I find myself caressing your skin

Then there's one word on my mind and that word is fuck
Then I know I'm a pervert because I like it
And I know I'm perverted because I want it

Want it all of the time
Want it all of the time
Want it all of the time
Want it all of the time

Then I know I'm a pervert because I like it
Yeah, want it right now

// No FB //

What do I care what you think of me
What do you think you mean to me
You mean nothing, can't you see
And I don't want to smell your stinky beaver

No fat beaver
No fat beaver
Swear I'm gonna leave her
Can't stand her fat beaver

You look real nice to talk to
But I can't stand to look at you
Stop chasing me all over the place
And get your fucking f.b. out of my face

No fat beaver
No fat beaver
Swear I'm gonna leave her
Can't stand her fat beaver

You may be the only chance I've got
But I think I'd rather be shot

What do I care what you think of me
What do you think you mean to me
You mean nothing, can't you see
Get away from me, you fucking f.b.

// Can't Go Back //

It's not like you said it was
Nothing like you said it was
It's a dirty old place and I can't go back

It's not like you said it was
Nothing like you said it was
I've been misused and I can't go back

It's a dirty old place and it's full of lies
And I can't see a thing through virgin's eyes
It's a dirty old place and it's full of lies
And I'm still seeing through virgin's eyes tonight,
And I can't go back and I can't go back

I had a young boy's dream
But I can plainly see
It's a filthy world and I can't go back
Now I can't go back
Now I can't go back I've been misused
And I can't go back

Everybody here is out to get me
Or at least that's how it seems to me
Everybody here is laughing at me
But now I know my weakness is my strength
And I want to go back and I can't go back

It's not like you said it was
Nothing like you said it was
It's a dirty old place and I can't go back

It's not like you said it was
Nothing like you said it was
I've been misused and I can't go back

It's a dirty old place and it's full of lies
And I can't see a thing through virgin's eyes
It's a dirty old place and it's full of lies
And I'm still seeing through virgin's eyes tonight,
And I can't go back and I can't go back

// GCF //

All I want is some good clean fun
Yeah all I want is some good clean fun

You can freak out, you can shoot up
You can fall down, you can self-destruct
Just leave me alone

Work hard, play hard
Work up a sweat stay out of trouble
If you're able don't spoil my day

So don't misunderstand what I say
It's hard to say no and not o.k.
Just take the drugs out of sex and drugs
And rock and roll

All I want is some good clean fun
Yeah all I want is some good clean fun

You can freebase, fall on your face
Waste what you got don't corrupt my life
Just leave me alone

Drown it in alcohol, I don't care at all
I like lust and sexual thrust
I like good clean fun

So don't misunderstand what I say
It's hard to say no and not o.k.
Take the drugs out of sex and drugs
And rock and roll

All I want is some good clean fun
Yeah all I want is some good clean fun
A good clean fun

// My World //

Stop knock knock knocking
Stop knock knock knocking
Stop knocking
Stop it

Went to the No Nukes rally
The Don Quixotes made me feel silly
Went to the punk rock show
Nobody that I know did go
Went to my university
Boys and girls dress up and look pretty
Went to the party last night
I was there, but it was really out of sight

My world is my mind
I'm locking myself inside
People, they can't get in
I have no use for them

Well I just came from my girl's bed
Don't think I'll ever forget what she said
I tried to show her my song
She laughed and said the chords were all wrong
Went out to look at the moon
Blood red and the water was too
Just ran away from her house
Not another word from her pretty little mouth

My world is my mind
I'm locking myself inside
People, they can't get in
I have no use for them

So stop knock knock knocking
Stop knock knock knocking
Stop knocking
Stop it
Stop knock knock knocking
Stop knock knock knocking
Stop knocking
Stop it

Well let me tell you what I did

I went to the toilet and sat down
There was no one else around
I went inside my closet
Took my guitar and strummed upon it
Went out to run 5 miles
Sifted through my personal files
Went to my desk to study
There's no world, no love, nobody

But me
And that's the way it's gonna be, yeah
That's the way it's gonna be, yeah
That's the way it's gonna be
Cause

My world is my mind
I'm locking myself inside
People, they can't get in
I have no use for them

So stop knock knock knocking
Stop knock knock knocking
Stop knocking
Stop it
Knocking on my world

// Silly Girl //

Started on a summer Sunday
Your pink dress on the setting sun
You were going to Grandma's house, I was too scared to come 

My silly girl, I'm beggin you
Tell me all the things that I want to hear
My silly girl, I'm in love with you

I had to run to catch you, 
You always moved so fast 
With your cute little smile and your silly laugh,
God gave me love at last 

My silly girl, I'm beggin you
Tell me all the things that I want to hear
My silly girl, I'm in love with you

They said just stay away
Right now I wish I had
I'm so in love with you, my silly girl 
They made me go away 
Sometimes life just isn't fair, but I'll be back someday
I hope you'll still be there 

My silly girl, I'm beggin you
Tell me all the things that I want to hear
My silly girl, I'm in love with you

When you're just a silly boy like me, you're always so scared 
Now I'm just out of luck, I wonder if you ever cared

My silly girl, I'm beggin you
Don't stop being a silly girl
My silly girl, I'm in love with you

They said just stay away
Right now I wish I had
I'm so in love with you, my silly girl

// In Love This Way //

I'm lonely today
Won't you come out to play
When I'm with you all the world goes away
Your smile and your eyes
They keep me alive
Your voice is a bell that massages my mind

And it makes me wonder
And it makes me sad
And it makes me nervous
And it makes me oh, so mad

Because I think about you every night and day
And when I could have asked I let it slip away
I've got to get to know you, but I'm so afraid
Well it's so hard to be a friend and be in love this way
Be in love this way
Be in love this way

Oh, talk to me please
You've brought me to my knees
Only your words melt my twenty year freeze
I've known you so long
I've known all along
But suddenly my thoughts of you are so strong

And it makes me wonder
And it makes me sad
And it makes me nervous
And it makes me oh, so mad

Because I wonder if I'm more than just a friend
Did I really see a fire or just inside my head
Sometimes I know you just want me to go away
Well it's so hard to be a friend and be in love this way
Be in love this way
Be in love this way

Karen, may I
See your blue eyes
Karen, may I
Tell you tonight
That it makes me wonder

// Christmas Vacation //

You were depressed, you were really messed up
You know I understand
But why did you not talk to me
Why didn't you help me prepare for the nightmare

You took a vacation
Into oblivion
You were so low
And I felt like I didn't know you

Christmas vacation, you took a vacation from me, oh
From me, oh

Once it ended, I mended myself
But it keeps falling back down off the shelves in my head
A twinge of pain now, a shudder of disgust
As I shield my eyes from my own memory

I knew all about your plans
I really did understand
But you didn't let me know
I wasn't invited to go

Christmas vacation, you took a vacation from me, oh
From me, oh

I watched in desperation as you stumbled before my eyes
She needs beer, she doesn't need me, I finally realized
My anger and pain in all your fun, you couldn't recognize
I stopped caring long before you started to cry

I knew all about your plans
I really did understand
But you didn't let me know
I wasn't invited to go

Christmas vacation, you took a vacation from me, oh
From me, oh
From me, oh
From me, oh

// Good Good Things //

I know a place,
Up in the air
It's not very far,
I've been there before

Well I know a place,
Cool and warm
Cooling my blood,
Warming my heart

So come on down and walk with me,
And tell me I'm your man
I only want to know a couple of things about you

Where were you when I was in so much trouble with myself
And do you still believe in me like I believe

I've been thinking good good things about you
Cool and warm, good good things about you
If you've been thinking good good things about me
So cool and warm when you put your arms around me

On my own,
I know where to go
Living the lie,
In your eyes

Well I know a place,
Cool and warm
Cooling my blood,
And warming my heart

So come on down and walk with me,
And tell me I'm your man
Let's see if I can get it right with you this time around

I'm not afraid of losing you, my little girl
But do you still believe in me like I believe

I've been thinking good good things about you
Cool and warm, good good things about you
If you've been thinking good good things about me
So cool and warm when you put your arms around me

// Ace //

I see the anger in the back of your eyes
I know the vengeance running through your mind
You're up on the cross with a heart full of nails
Hanging your head low whenever you fail

You're thinking (now's the time)
You keep saying (now's the time)
But you still keep standing still
You're free now (now's the time)
It's over now (now's the time)
And I believe now's the time to live

And there ain't a thing now that you can do
You expect everyone to have pity on you
Nobody else can put their life in your hands
So get up and move while you still have the chance

With all of your mind
And all of your soul
And all of your heart
If you want to be smart
You've got a lot to give
Don't throw it away
You'll have your way some day
It will come to you

You're thinking (now's the time)
You keep saying (now's the time)
But you still keep standing still
You're free now (now's the time)
It's over now (now's the time)
And I believe now's the time to live

Do what you do with the rest of your days
You had it all and you gave some away
It's not going to matter when you're dead and gone
You'll be rewarded for the good that you've done

So quit thinking (now's the time)
And start doing (now's the time)
You've got a lot to live for
So quit crying (now's the time)
And start trying (now's the time)
Now's the time
Now's the time to live

You say you've been run through the lover's mill
But people are starving while you get your fill
There's no time for standing still
There's another void that you can fulfill
That you can fulfill

With all of your mind
And all of your soul
And all of your heart
If you want to be smart
You've got a lot to give
Don't throw it away
You'll have your way some day
It will come to you

So quit thinking (now's the time)
And start doing (now's the time)
You've got a lot to live for
So quit crying (now's the time)
And start trying (now's the time)
Now's the time
Now's the time to live
