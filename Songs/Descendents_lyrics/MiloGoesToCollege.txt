// Myage //

Almost ready, almost there, 
Or is it already over? 
She's a friend in need; she's a friend indeed, 
Needs someone to hold her. 

Alone at night, she plans her game,
Correctly thinking that I'm in pain,
Every night, it's all the same. 
She's been a-fuckin' with my brain. 

She don't need no one. 
She don't need no one. 

We all wanna play your game with you.
We know you're just a starter. 
There's no reason for you to quit
Just because we try harder. 

I don't wanna talk on the telephone. 
I don't wanna see no pictures. 
She'll find out just what she needs. 
When she does, I'll get her. 

She feels safe when she's with him.
He'll never try anything with her. 
Now, you know, girl, you're just what I want.
Are you gonna let it scare you? 

I knew it would. 

She don't need no one.
She don't need no one. 

She don't need no one. 
She don't need no one. 
She don't need me.

// I Want To Be A Bear //

Got your jourdache jeans
Got your pretty long hair
Dinner and a movie powder your nose
Take their honey for lay
Just like pay
You're just a human being on this planet
You're just flesh and blood like all the rest
You'll get old and have a wrinkled ass
Humans are ses I want to be a bear
I want to shit in the woods
In my cave hunt my prey
Could be you, I want to have food
Burgers not berries
Ladies are women but women are ladies
Got a baited hook you are calling it
Your cherry
You want to settle down
And you want to get married
I don't want to smell your muff

// I'm Not A Loser //

Think that I'm a loser,
'Cause now my pants are too low
Think that I'm a slob,
'Cause I got holes in my shoes
Think my cock is like,
Just like my dirty shirt
Well you can fuck off,
'Cause I'm working sixty a week

You think that life is really tough
When your daddy won't buy you a brand new car
Take a girl out, she won't fuck you,
You just bought her a gram of coke
Spent all your money on shitty coke

I'm not a loser!
That's right, I'm not a loser!
I'm not a loser!

Cruise down the boulevard wasting mommy's gas
While you're looking for some kicks on Friday night
Your only goal in life is to smoke a joint
And decide how you're gonna get laid tonight

You are a fucking son-of-a-bitch, you arrogant assholes
Your pants are too tight, you fucking homos
You suck, Mr. Buttfuck, you don't belong here
Go away, you fucking gay. I'm not a loser!

// Parents //

Parents, why won't they shut up?
Parents, they're so fucked up
They treat me like a tool
They take me for a fool

Parents, why won't they shut up?
Parents, they're so fucked up
Oh they're so fucking dense
They look into the past
For future reference

Parents, why won't they shut up?
Parents, they're so fucked up
They don't even know I'm a boy
Just treat me like a toy
But little do they know
That one day I'll explode

I am a boy and not a toy
I will kill and I'll destroy
I am a boy and not a toy
I will kill and I will destroy

Parents!
Parents!
Parents!

They don't even know I'm a boy
They treat me like a toy
But little do they know
That one day I'll explode

I am a boy and not a toy
I will kill and I'll destroy
I am a boy and not a toy
I will kill and I will destroy

Parents!
Parents!
Parents!
Parents!

// Tonyage //

You beat up Fearl's bass player
You were all surfers last year
3 years ago it wasn't cool
You spit on me, but I'm no one
Eh, bobby pin had long hair
But you spit on Darby Crash
He had a fucking mohawk man
3 years ago
Forming in 1975
I'm a new waver
My girlfriend's a surfer
I'm no more a trendy than you are
And she's not going to fuck you anyways
Eh, it dosen't matter, you all suck
You don't know shit about punk rock
You're just a bunch of drug addicts
Screwing up what we call fun
I hate everything, that means you
I hate you more than I do
I got no time to sleep, time to get laid
I got a 2"x 2", but it dosen't matter
Fake hard core
You spit on urinals

// M-16 //

Go shoot your M-16. 
Go shoot your M-16.
Go shoot your M-16. 
I'm not gonna live your American dream.

Army life is right for me.
Kill to save democracy.
Got a rebel in my sights.
Money's worth more than his life,
So kill; it's fun.

Shoot him; you're better than him.
Shoot him in the eye.
Shoot him; it gives you a thrill.
Just like as a kid, only now it's for real.

Army life is right for me.
Kill to save democracy.
Got a rebel in my sights.
Money's worth more than his life,
So kill; it's fun.

// I'm Not A Punk //

I'm not a punk; how can I be?
Show me the way to conformity.
Try to be different, but it's always the same.
End up playin' someone else's game.

I'm just a square goin' nowhere. 
I'm just a square goin' nowhere.

You used to walk by my side.
Now you see me comin', now you hide.
I see you here, I see you there.
I can see that you don't care. 

I'm just a square goin' nowhere. 
I'm just a square goin' nowhere.

I'm just a square goin' nowhere.
Square goin' nowhere.
I'm just a square goin' nowhere.
Square goin' nowhere.

// Catalina //

My room's a mess, I don't care
Tired of sitting at my desk
You can't bother me
Man, I'm far away from you
Got to get away
You can't ruin my day
You can't tell me what to do
You can't make me think I love you

Shoot it in your arm, you can't hurt me
I'm on my way to Catalina
I'm not going to read your books
My tank's full of squid
And it's getting light

Whores, you can't make me want
I got all the fish I need
On the deck of my boat
You can't take my heart when I'm here
('Cause it's a) long swim home
For your cute little arms

I'll steal some gas, fix my motor
Turn on my Beatles tape
And get you out of my head

Ah yes, here I am, far away from everyone
And the only fish I smell
Is on the deck of my boat
Yeah, I want to go (I really want to go)
but my motor's broken
There's no scotch tape, I'm out of gas,
Looks like I'm stuck here
(Shit)Looks like I'm stuck here

I'll steal some gas, fix my motor
Turn on my Doors tape
And get you out of my head
Get you out of my head

Ah, head.

// Suburban Home //

I want to be stereotyped
I want to be classified

I want to be stereotyped
I want to be classified

I want to be a clone
I want a suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home

I want to be masochistic
I want to be a statistic

I want to be a clone
I want a suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home

I don't want no hippie pad
I want a house just like mom and dad

I want to be stereotyped
I want to be classified
I want to be masochistic
I want to be a statistic

I want to be a clone
I want a suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home

I want to be stereotyped
I want to be classified

// Statue Of Liberty //

Well the people walk all around
The thing on an island very far from here
They pay it homage like a god
And they paint it on each and every year
A sign for all it was given to us
And we all appreciate this bomb
The tourists don't know and never will
It has no use it's meaning is gone
The Statue of Liberty
And for united we stand
We all agree it's a mystery
But why'd they give it to us?
We still don't know just why it came
A present from god or by the rain
The crowds swarm wildly to see it's peak
When I watch I go insane
Why is it so important to them
What is the beauty they see in it
I don't know why I just accept it
I don't want it cause it makes me sick

// Kabuki Girl //

Look out get out of my way

I'm going to the atomic cafe 

I'm going to the atomic cafe 

You're a mystery to me kabuki girl


Don't say sayonara I want to see you tomorrow

I want to see you tonight

You're a mystery to me kabuki girl


Your face is white 

Your hair is black 

You'll probably stab me in the back 

But that's the chance I'm gonna take 


Don't say sayonara I want to see you tomorrow

I want to see you tonight

You're a mystery to me kabuki girl


East is east, west is west 

Girls from the east are the best

They got more of what I'm lookin' for


Ahhhhhh! 

Look out get out of way 

I'm going to the atomic cafe

I'm going to the atomic cafe 

You're a mystery to me kabuki girl

// Marriage //

Do you know what I think about you? 
Do you know what I feel is true? 
Do you know what I think about her? 
I know she thinks about me, I'm sure

I don't know why it's so, but it's true [x2]

So you know what I think about you 
Do you know what you want me to do? 
When you see me staring at you,
Do you know what I want you to do? 

I don't know why it's so, but it's true [x4]

I don't want to have sex with you 
I want to be your friend 
I want to be with you 
I want you to marry me 

So you know what I think about you 
Do you know that my speed is you?
I know I want you to be my wife 
It's you and me for the rest of your life 

Do you know what I think about you?

// Hope //

Why can't you see you torture me
You're already thinking about someone else
When he comes home
You'll be in his arms and I'll be gone
But I know my day will come
I know someday I'll be the only one

So now you wait for his spark
You know it'll turn you on
He's gonna make you feel
The way you want to feel
When he starts to lie
When he makes you cry
You know I'll be there
My day will come i know
Someday I'll be the only one

Call me selfish
Call me what you like
I think it's right
To want someone for all your own
And not to share her love
And I'll have my way
And won't have to say anyway
Cause I've got you
You don't stand a chance

So now you wait for his cock
You know it'll turn you on
He's gonna make you feel
The way you want to feel
When he starts to lie
When he makes you cry
You know I'll be there
My day will come
I know someday I'll be the only one

My day will come
I know someday I'll be the only one

So now you want perfection
I see your self destruction
You don't know what you want
It's gonna take you years to find out
I'm not giving up
And when you've had enough
You'll take your bruised little head
And you'll come running back to me
You know that I'm gonna be the only one.

// Bikeage //

Running out of time again
Where did you go wrong this time?
When your problems overwhelm you
Go get drunk, it's party time

Take a Quaalude, relax your mind
Relax your body too
Run from your problems but you'll never get away
No one wants you, and you wonder why?

Sitting there with your mouth full of beer
Your eyes are glazed, your face is red
Who's gonna pick you up and use you for tonight?

When you're on the streets with a needle in your arm
Selling your body for another fix
Who's gonna pick you up and take you home with them tonight?

You're running out of breath again
You're an old maid, but you're only 15
You're losing your little girl's charm
Cry all night but you'll never get it back

Don't be afraid, it's not too late
Save yourself, I need you here
Wearing off, wearing out
I can't think about it cause it makes me sick

Sitting there with your mouth full of beer
Your eyes are glazed, your face is red
Who's gonna pick you up and use you for tonight?
Not me, not me

When you're on the streets with a needle in your arm
Selling your body for another fix
Who's gonna pick you up and take you home with them tonight?
Not me, not me...

// Jean Is Dead //

Wake up early, mad at you.
Go to school, but where are you? 
You should've told me, I should've known,
But now you're gone, and I'm alone.

Your mother told me last night on the phone.
Why'd you do it? Now I'm alone.
I would've helped you, would've done anything.
Taken you with me, or bought you a ring.

Now you're gone, and I'm alone!
Now you're gone, and I'm alone!

You should've told me, I should've known,
But now you're gone, and I'm alone.

Your mother told me last night on the phone.
Why'd you do it? Now I'm alone.
I would've helped you, would've done anything.
Taken you with me, or bought you a ring.

Now you're gone, and I'm alone!
Now you're gone, and I'm alone!
Now you're gone, and I'm alone!
Now you're gone, and I'm alone!

You should've told me, I should've known,
But now you're gone, and I'm alone.
