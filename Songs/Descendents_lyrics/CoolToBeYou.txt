Album: CoolToBeYou

// Nothing With You //

I don't wanna move
I'll just sit here in my living room
And see what's on the tube
While I'm hanging out with you

People knock on my door
Ringing my phone
Telling me the things I gotta get done today
To satisfy them, but what about me?
Lately I've been wishing I was brain dead
No responsibilities in my head today
Baby let's see what's on the TV

Doing nothing having fun
off to bed to get things done
I'm not lazy, I'm in love
I don't wanna move
I'll just sit here in my living room
And see what's on the tube
While I'm hanging out with you

People pressing my flesh
Taking my time
They don't know a thing about my life with you
I'm trying real hard
Hard not to care
Cause all I ever really want to do
Is sit around doing nothing with you
Because nothing's only fun when you're there

"Mad About You" at dinnertime
"Seinfeld", "Simpsons", "So-Called Life"
Seen the reruns 20 million times

I don't wanna move
I'll just sit here in my living room
And see what's on the tube
While I'm hanging out with you

all I wanna do is just sit here in my living room
And see what's on the tube
While I'm hanging out with you

All I wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
Is do nothing with you

All I wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
Is do nothing with you

// 'Merican //

We flipped our finger to the king of England
Stole our country from the indians
With god on our side and guns in our hands
We took it for our own
A nation dedicated to liberty
Justice and equality
Does it look that way to you? It doesn't look that way to me
The sickest joke I know

Listen up man, I'll tell you who I am
Just another stupid American
You don't wanna listen, you don't wanna understand
So finish up your drink and go home

I come from the land of Ben Franklin
Twain and Poe and Walt Whitman
Otis Redding, Ellington
The country that I love
But it's a land of the slaves and the ku klux klan
Haymarket riot and the great depression
Joe McCarthy, Vietnam
The sickest joke I know

Listen up man, I'll tell you who I am
Just another stupid American
You don't wanna listen, you don't wanna understand
So finish up your drink and go home

I'm proud and ashamed
Every fourth of July
You got to know the truth
Before you say that you got pride

Now the cops got tanks 'cause the kids got guns
Shrinks pushing pills on everyone
Cancer from the ocean, cancer from the sun
Straight to Hell we go

Listen up man, I'll tell you who I am
Just another stupid American
You don't wanna listen, you don't wanna understand
So finish up your drink and go home
Listen up man, I'll tell you who I am
Just another stupid American
You don't wanna listen, you don't wanna understand
So finish up your drink and go home
Finish up your drink and go home

// Talking //

Talking about our life
No matter how much I don't like
Talk is never cheap between you and me
Look at how far we've come
And so we always come undone
Maybe that's how it always has to be

I'm out here alone
Talking on the phone
Tensions are risin' it's never surprising
This is the way it goes
Maybe we'll fall in love when I get home

Talking about our life
Seems like we never get it right
But we always get an A for effort
We're searching for what to say
Communications the only way
If we ever hope to stay together
Communicate

I'm out here alone
Talking on the phone
Tensions are risin' it's never surprising
This is the way it goes
Maybe we'll fall in love when I get home

Tell me the problem
I wanna know
If there's a solution I'll fix it now
And if there isn't I'll just be there
If I don't say something
Don't say I don't care

Well I go yaduh duh duh duh duh
And you go yaduh duh duh duh duh
Yaduh duh duh duh duh ya that's what we gotta do

I'm out here alone
Talking on the phone
Tensions are risin' it's never surprising
This is the way it goes
Maybe we'll fall in love when I get home
Maybe we'll fall in love when I get home
I said maybe we'll fall in love when I get home

// She Don't Care //

I get up every morning
And make her coffee like I've always done
She won't look in my eyes
What has our love become?

Tried talking about it (We talk around it)
We talk around it
And never get nowhere
I gave her everything I got
And she don't care

She don't care...
No she don't!

Ten years before
I recognized the sacrifice she made to be with me
Said 'when you want to you can leave'

It's easy to make promises
While you're dumb in love
Watch them all evaporate 
Because she's had enough

Tried talking about it (We talk around it)
We talk around it
And never get nowhere
I gave her everything I got...

She made up her mind
I lost my wife, my lover, my best friend
And I don't think I'll ever be right again

It's easy to make promises
While you're dumb in love
Watch them all evaporate 
Because she's had enough

Tried talking about it (We talk around it)
We talk around it
And never get nowhere
And I'm lonelier than you know...
She don't care

She don't care
She don't care

// Dog And Pony Show //

Another night of maybe and almost
Abandoning a land of passin' ghosts

Just a lot of sad people forgive them Lord
They don't care what they do
Or who they do it to
At the dog and pony show

They don't wanna know

To think I could have stayed home
Instead of watching this ugly lust and ordinary dirt
But no one cares, so nobody gets hurt

Just a lot of sad people forgive them Lord
They don't care who they do
Or what it does to you
At the dog and pony show
They don't wanna know
They're doing some blow

They all stand in line and take their chances
Roping all their robot dances
Dying to get off
There's a lot of pretty girls here looking tight
They're not good girls
But they're good for the night
They're telling me to buzz off
Well that's okay, cause I never liked them anyway

It's no place for a mongrel mutt like me
Mating rights go to the best of breed

Just a lot of sad people
Caught in between 
Desire and despair
I guess I'll see you there
At the lost and lonely
Dog and pony show

They don't wanna know
They don't wanna know
They don't wanna know
So afraid and alone

// Blast Off //

Stay away from the chili verde
Unless you want to get blown away
Treat the spider with a little respect
You take the heat - it's gonna bite back

Blast off at Cape Canaveral
Toilet seat is your launching pad
Blast off at Cape Canaveral
4, 3, 2, 1, Blast off!

Capsaicinoids are a thing to avoid
Unless you wanna burn in that 'roid
Weâll be laughing and rolling on the floor
When we hear you screaming through that door

Blast off at Cape Canaveral
All systems go!
Blast off at Cape Canaveral
4, 3, 2, 1, Blast off!

Shhhh, shh shh you can hear him! You can hear...
No, no, listen! You can hear him

Jalepeno, Habenero
Burning all yo' hair down there-o
Picinu, Vindaloo
They're gonna getcha
They're gonna getcha too!

You know those red things in the Kung Pao?
Don't say I didn't warn you now
Take the time to pick them out
Or the spider gets grouchy
And it's time to countdown!

Blast off at Cape Canaveral
Ohh ohhh ohhh
Blast off at Cape Canaveral
WOOOOO HOOOO!
Blast off at Cape Canaveral
Houston, we have a problem
Blast off at Cape Canaveral
Now 4, 3, 2, 1, Blast off!

// Dreams //

Why do I daydream?
Oh why do I get my hopes up at all?
I've been living this Walter Mitty life for too long
Somebody save me
I'm a prisoner of my own fears

Sometimes fantasy is the only problem I bear
My mind is a dream filled balloon
Dripping dreams into my shoes
And I'm too afraid to move
To face the real world
And when I fall, I fall down hard
When will I ever learn?
Don't take your dreams to heart 
You'll only wind up getting burned
(BURNED)

Well maybe I'm lazy
But circumstances always knock me down
So I'll just lie here
Never get up, off the ground
Well maybe it's crazy 
To sit and think of all the things I want to do
What's the use of dreaming
When dreams never come true?

And when I fall I fall down hard
When will I ever learn?
Don't take your dreams to heart
You'll only wind up getting burned

Why do I daydream? 
Why do I daydream? 
Why do I bother? 
WHY?

Why do I daydream? (Time to get up off your ass)
Why do I daydream? (Pull your head up take a chance)
Why do I bother? (Grab whatever you can grab)
WHY? (There's no such thing)

It's time to get up off your ass
Pull your head up take a chance
Grab whatever you can grab
There's no such thing

It's time to get up off your ass
Pull your head up take a chance
Grab whatever you can grab
There's no such thing

It's time to get up off your ass
Pull your head up take a chance
Grab whatever you can grab
There's no such thing
No such thing

// Cool To Be You //

I don't believe in unity
it's just one more abandoned dream
once the people get together it's easy to see
it's just a matter of time til they come after me

but it must be pretty cool to be you
with your brothers at your back, protecting you
it must be pretty cool to know you belong
isolated my whole life counting scars in the land of the smiling knives
yes I'm envious it's true, but it must be cool to be you

you got a loving family to give you everything you need
my family loves each other so much
we live a thousand miles away and never stay in touch

but it must be pretty cool to be you
with a home and a family to go home to
must be pretty cool to know you belong
isolated my whole life counting scars in the land of the smiling knives
yes I'm envious it's true but it must be cool to be you

what can I do? I know this bitter jealousy is wrong
maybe i'll move, and find a brand new place I don't belong
some friends I'll never know (I'll never know) 
New places I can't go (I can't go)
Cause everywhere I've been
Is on the outside lookin in...

You got a deep sustaining faith,
a lord who listens when you pray
I was raised in a church and I was taught to believe
I wonder if god believes in me...

It must be pretty cool to be you
with your holy faith sustaining you
must be pretty cool to know you belong
isolated my whole life counting scars in the land of the smiling knives
yes I'm envious it's true but it must be cool to be you

Must be cool to be you

Must be cool...................

// Maddie //

Come on baby
We gotta get our clothes on
There'll be no easy days
Cause I got no degree

You'll see your brother in a week or three
Here's a picture of me 
Just don't let them see
Cause they're not that fond of me
They're gonna tell you that I'm not real
But their time is through
And I'll be the one
Ya I'll see this through

I'll fight for you
No one else is going to 
They're to busy fighting over you

Come on baby
We gotta get our plane now
Punk rock won't pay the bills
So we gotta get started early
I like to hang around here with you
Gotta life to teach you
Just you and me

Their gonna tell you that I'm not real
But their time is through
And I'm with you still
And I'll be the one (I'll be the one)
Ya I'll see this through 

I'll fight for you
No one else is going to 
Their to busy fighting over you

Their gonna tell you that I'm not real
But we're having fun together everyday
What could be more real than that?
To a girl who and her dad
And there is no way for they to brainwash you away from me

Come on baby
I gotta try to explain things
There's no easy way to say these things to you
There's no easy way to tell you what is real
So come on baby let's just go home now
I'll be responsible
I'll do everything I have to 

Ya I'll be the one
I'll be invincible
I'll see it through
I'll be invincible
I'll fight for you
I'll fight for you
We'll be okay

// Mass Nerder //

Don't got no goatee
Don't got no tattoo
Don't got no nose ring
Don't wanna be like you

See I got these glasses
So I'll never be cool
Always get my ass kick
When I get to school

Don't worry about image
Don't got no attitude
I know I won't get laid
If I wont be like you!

Don't got no biceps
Don't got no pecks
But I'll read you under the table
With my thick specks

See I got these glasses
So they kick my ass
But I'll kick their asses
When I get to class

I got these glasses
So I can't wear shades
I'll kick their asses
I'll get good grades

Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna get good grades!

I can't get rid of the times
Can't stop the party line
Don't know what the scenes about
Don't tell me to mellow out!

Don't got no goatee
No fucking safety pin
No I ain't no junkie
Don't got no heroin

Don't got no styling lotion
Don't wanna live by the ocean
Just wanna be myself
All you posers go to hell!

Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna get good grades!

Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna get good grades!

Asses in class

Somebody get me a book!

// One More Day //

Spent the last years
In denial of my grief
Because you hated me
Anyone could see
I'll always wonder
What I meant to you
And why you hated me
What I did to you

I can't get anywhere
Pretending that I don't care
Lying to everyone I see
When the only thing I needed was

One more day like yesterday
I'd pick you up, you'd put me down
Wish you were still around
For one more day like yesterday
With you

And in the end
We didn't have a thing to say
Still those games to play 
Then you passed away
I'll always wonder
Why you had to leave
Why you hated me
Then laid the blame on me

Cold antiseptic stares
The smell of the sickroom air
Yeah, I let you go down there
The only child
Who never cared about

One more day like yesterday
I'd pick you up, You'd put me down
Wish you were still around
For one more day like yesterday
With you

I'll always wonder
If I could have meant more to you
I'll always wonder 
If I could have done more for you
How could I just turn my back
How could I just walk away
How could I just close my eyes 
And watch you die

We never got along
We never got a chance
To sing our song of love

I loved my daddy boy
Did you love your boy?
Oh, you feel so warm to me now
But it's cold in this room
Tomorrow they'll put you
In the ground
Then there's nothing I can
ever do to have

One more day like yesterday
I'd pick you up, you'd put me down
Wish you were still around
For one more day like yesterday
With you

// Tack //

Time for a new me
I hear they're having a sale
At thrifty
I'm trading myself in
And I don't care what I get for it
'Cause I finally burned out
Been kicking myself 
For way too long

Finally found out 
What it feels like to be living a lie
Wasting my time, paralyzed
Wishing I was in another world

I'm taking a new tack
Gotta turn my back to turn back
I don't wanna close doors
But I don't wanna feel this way anymore
So I'm finding my way out
By turning away from a brick wall

Finally found out 
What it feels like to be living a lie
Wasting my time, paralyzed
Wishing I was in another world

Somebody tell me what to do
I've wasted my last 15 years
Jumping through their hoops
Only to find nothing waiting for me
But academic oblivion 
My proud destiny

See I finally burned out 
Been kicking myself 
For way too long

Finally found out 
What it feels like to be living a lie
Wasting my time, paralyzed
Wishing I was in another world

Wishing I was in another world..
(Somebody tell me what to do)
Wishing I was in another world:

Time for a new me.

// Anchor Grill //

Love in our hearts, we didnât know the world is complicated
Gleam in our eyes, time would show just what our love was made of

Who knew the way things work in this world weâve made for ourselves?
Where I work myself to death, and you raise the kids

Canât we try to amend our path of struggle for a while?
To pretend our lives are free and carefree still?
And that I just fell in love with you at the Anchor Grill

Money and timeâ¦ we didnât know theyâd be so hard to come by
"Look and youâll find"? We didnât know, thatâs just some fabled school rhyme

Weâll never get ahead in this world
Not âtil we move ahead of this world weâve made for ourselves
Where thereâs no time to kiss, and no room to even breathe

Canât we try to amend our path of struggle for a while?
To pretend our lives are free and carefree still?
And that I just fell in love with you
At the Anchor Grill
Itâs our life, itâs standing right in front of me
Itâs our time, and we know the way we wanna be
Canât you see?

So letâs drop the kids at your folks, letâs go
Where itâs never too late for breakfast
And everythingâs gonna get better

Canât we try to amend our path of struggle for a while?
Canât we try to amend our path of struggle for a while?
To pretend our lives are free and carefree still?
âCause I just fell in love with you
At the Anchor Grill

// Dry Spell //

If it was for me,
I thought it would come so easy.
Never realized, lifes just a series of lows and highs.
I just want to create, it doesnt matter how i do it.
Nobody ever said thats theres nothing to it.

Goosebumps been gone, for way to long.

Couldnt get it for free, couldnt do it for the money.
It just disapeared, spent alot of bearin years.
and if it doesnt work out, you can just set it down for later.
Nobody ever said you'd be dead forever.

Goosebumps been gone, for way to long.
Who knows how long, they'll stick around.
