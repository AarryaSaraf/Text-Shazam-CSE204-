Album: Energy

// Lay It On The Line //

Boy, you've got something special
That keeps me coming back for more
I'll be your slave, don't make me your fool
It's time that I knew the score
I know your mama done told you
That I'm not that kind of girl
But I'm old enough to know what I want
Lay it on the line
Lay it on the line

You know you got me rocking and reeling
And tossin' in my sleep
I really need you
Only want to please you
For each and every day, now
And your friends try to tell you
That I'm not good enough for you
But you know my point of view
Lay it on the line
Lay it on the line

Lay it, lay it on the line
Come on and lay it, lay it on the line

You can follow smiling faces
They will take you to many places
But you'll never find another love like mine
So think before you close the door
Your friends try to tell you
That I'm not good enough for you
But I'm old enough to know what I want
Lay it on the line
Lay it on the line

// Dirty Work //

Times are hard
You're afraid to pay the fee
So you find yourself somebody
Who can do the job for free
When you need a bit of lovin'
Cause your woman is out of town
That's the time you get me runnin'
And you know I'll be around

[Chorus:]
I'm a fool to do your dirty work
Oh yeah
I don't wanna do your dirty work
No more
I'm a fool to do your dirty work
Oh yeah

Light the candle
Put the lock upon the door
You have sent the maid home early
Like a thousand times before
Like the castle in it's corner
In a medieval game
I foresee terrible trouble
And I stay here just the same

[Chorus]

// Hypnotized //

It's the same kind of story
That seems to come down from long ago
Two friends having coffee together
When something flies by their window
It might be out on that lawn
Which is wide, at least half of a playing field
Because there's no explaining what your imagination
Can make you see and feel
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
Now it's not a meaningless question
To ask if they've been and gone
I remember a talk about North
Carolina and a strange, strange pond
You see the sides were like glass
In the thick of a forest without a road
And if any man's ever made that land
Then I think it would've showed
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized
They say there's a place down in Mexico
Where a man can fly over mountains and hills
And he don't need an airplane or some kind of engine
And he never will
Now you know it's a meaningless question
To ask if those stories are right
'Cause what matters most if the feeling
You get when you're hypnotized
Seems like a dream
They got me hypnotized

// As I Come Of Age //

As I come of age
I keep fallin' down
And I feel just like a schoolboy
I was in a senseless rage
Runnin' too hard
And I tore you all to pieces

Yes but it's all over now
I'm a little bit older now
The lessons that I'm learnin' now
Gonna make it easy
Somehow

Now then can I try
Starting over
Put the pieces back together
Even as I cry bitter tears
I can see it's all a puzzle
A game
Always the same

By the time I die with the passing
If I've sorted out my changes
And if you could take the time
I would tell you that it's still a puzzle
The same
Always a game

// Come And Get Your Love //

How long must I sit around waiting for you
Think of all the heartache you've been putting me though
You must have a soul, but it don't show.
Come on and love me or let me go
Or come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love,
Before I give it away.
Come and get it.

You're a devil witch and I'm hypnotized
But woman I can see right through your eyes.
Here's something for you, take it from me.
Why don't you love me or set me free
Or come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love,
Before I give it away.

I've been holding on to your love for so long.
Could be I will tire of the face I admire.
So why don't you say just go away.
Or come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
Before I give it away.

// Happiness //

I love the way you love to live
You got life, you're inspiration
I love the way that you do
Your heart's so freely
You're a sweet sensation
You're my invitation to happiness
You're full of sweet surprises happiness
You fill my heart desire
More, more, more and more
And over and over again
Keep that goodness coming
I love the way you watch the world
Through kind eyes
That's why you're never sad, sad
Things don't bother you like dos, don'ts and whys
You hold on to the good and you let the bad go by
Yeah, yeah
Happiness
I want your love forever
Happiness
Give me your love forever
More, more, more and more
And over and over again
Keep that goodness coming
Happiness

More, more, more and more
And over and over again
Keep that goodness coming
Keep it coming, keep it coming
Keep it coming, coming
Keep it coming, keep it coming
Keep it, keep it coming

// Fire //

I'm ridin' in your car
You turn on the radio
You're pullin' me close
I just say no
I say I don't like it
But you know I'm a liar
'Cause when we kiss
Ooooh, fire

Late at night
You're takin' me home
You say you wanna stay
I say I wanna be alone
I say I don't love you
But you know I'm a liar
'Cause when we kiss
Ooooh, fire

You had a hold on me
Right from the start
A grip so tight
I couldn't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin'
Actin' like a fool
Well, your kisses they burn
But my heart stays cool

Well, Romeo and Juliet
Samson and Delilah
Baby you can bet
A love they couldn't deny
My words say split
But my words they lie
'Cause when we kiss
Ooooh, fire

Ooooh, fire
Kisses like fire
Burn me up with fire
I like what you're doin' now
Fire
Touchin' me
Fire
Touchin' me
Burnin' me
Fire
Take me home

// Angry Eyes //

Time, time and again I see you staring down at me
Now, then and again I wonder what it is that you see
With those Angry Eyes
Well, I bet you wish you could cut me down
With those Angry Eyes

You want to believe that I am not the same as you
And now I can't conceive, oh Lord, of what it is you're trying to do
With those Angry Eyes
Well, I bet you wish you could cut me down
With those Angry Eyes
What a shot you could be if you could shoot at me
With those Angry Eyes

You and I must start to realize
Blindness binds us in a false disguise
Can you see me through those Angry Eyes?

You try to defend that you are not the one to blame
But I'm finding it hard, my friend, when I 'm in the deadly aim
Of those Angry Eyes
Well, I bet you wish you could cut me down
With those Angry Eyes
What a shot you could be if you could shoot at me
With those Angry Eyes

// Echoes Of Love //

I hear your voice everywhere
Echoes of love

Making me look back
Over my shoulder
Echoes of love are starting all over
Echoes of love
Keeps on hurting
They're out of control
Keeps on burning
Echoes of love are out of control
Bringing back love I used to hold

Darling since you went away
I think about you every day
So-oh many memories
About to get the best of me

Recalling the time
I used to hold you
I just wouldn't do what I was supposed to
I've done things I'd like to undo
But darling it's you I'd like to run to

Echoes of love
Keeps on hurting
They're out of control
Keeps on burning
Echoes of love are out of control
Bringing back love I used to hold

Darling since you went away
I think about you every day
So-oh many memories
About to get the best of me.

Echoes of love
Echoes of love
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Echoes of love
Echoes of love
Keeps on hurting
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Echoes of love
Keeps on hurting

// Everybody Is A Star //

Everybody is a star
Who could rain and chase the dust away
Everybody wants to shine
Who would come out on a cloudy day

'Til the sun that loves you 'round
When the system tries to bring you down
Never had to shine at night
You don't need darkness to do what you think is right

Everybody is a star
I can feel it when you shine on me
I love you for who you are
Not the one you feel, you need to be

Ever catch a falling star
Ain't no stopping 'til it's in the ground
Everybody is a star
One big circle moving 'round and 'round

Shine, shine, shine, shine, shine
Come on and shine, everybody shine
Shine, shine, shine, shine
Shine
Come on and shine, everybody shine
