// Yes We Can Can //

Now's the time for all good men
To get together with one another
We got to iron out our problems
And iron out our quarrels
And try to live as brothers

And try to find peace within
Without stepping on one another
And do respect the women of the world
Remember, you all had mothers

We got to make this land a better land
Than the world in which we live
And we got to help each man be a better man
With the kindness that we give

I know we can make it
I know darn well, we can work it out
Oh, yes, we can, I know we can, can
Yes, we can, can, why can't we?
If we wanna, yes, we can, can

I know we can make it work
I know that we can make it if we try
Oh, yes, we can, I know we can, can
Yes, we can great gosh Almighty
Oh, yes, we can, I know we can, can

And we gotta take care of all the children
The little children of the world
'Cause they're our strongest hope for the future
The little bitty boys and girls

We got to make this land a better land
Than the world in which we live
And we gotta help each man be a better man
With the kindness that we give

I know we can make it
I know, darn well we can work it out
Oh, yes, we can, I know we can, can
Yes, we can, can, why can't we?

// Cloudburst //

I was blue and I was always wearing a frown
Because my man had turned me down.
Then we met and you can bet I knew from the first,
You were my love,
And that's when the old gray cloudburst.

My heart really flew,
The day you caught my eye.
I hope that we two will never say "Good-bye."
Clouds of gray have silver linings when they reverse.
I found your love and that's when the old gray cloudburst.

Hey, baby...
I'm gonna tell you 'bout your lovin'
And your kissn' and your huggin'
And your sweet turtle-dovin' pretty baby.
I won't be satisfied til I hear 'em play,
"Here comes the bride."
Listen to me baby and I don't mean maybe.
Listen to my story,
It's terrifficly true.
I gotta find a way of telling you that I really go for you.
I hope you really believe me baby 'cause I certainly do.
'Cause you're thrillin' me, you're really,
Really thrilling when you tell me that you probably got a kind of crush on me,
That moves me, grooves me.
How divine can one woman be?
Well little darlin',
You got me fallin'.
You got me goofy and gay.
I'm gonna get carried away.
Just think, you're gonna be mine someday.
Oh, let's spin a little,
Park a little, stop a little,
Spark a little,
Live a little,
Love a little,
Maybe turtle-dove a little baby.
Every time you hold me so near,
Nobody loves me like you, dear.
Let's stop a little, squeeze a little,
Probably maybe tease a little,
Try a little, sigh a little,
Maybe have to cry a little bit,
'cause to tell you the truth,
I'm gonna love you and that's it.
'Cause I love you baby,
Love you baby,
Love you baby,
Love you baby,
With all my heart.
Oooh, listen to me while I say I let
A lotta little ladies get away
Because I know,
I know pretty baby, I know,
I know, pretty baby,
I know you're the one, yes you're the one.
I knew when I met you what a break it was to get you.
When it's cloudy and gray and that's the worst.
How do you cause the cloud to burst?
You got to find a lover,
Find a lover, find a lover, find a lover.
If it's silvery under clouds of gray.
How do you chase the clouds away?
You gotta find a little girl
And make her love you a lot.
Don't ever leave unless you flip your
Lid and really want to ruin the plot.
Sounds easy does it?
Light as a breeze thru the trees.
Boy, how pleasant was it?
Pleasant as one summer day, boy.
It's so wonderful,
What a love can do.
Look at what love has done for you.
Hey, I'm a lucky lover, lucky lover,
I got the love you should discover.
I was blue and I was always wearing a frown,
Because my gal had turned me down.
Then we met and you can bet I knew from the first,
You were my love,
And that's when the old gray cloudburst.
Take a look at me.
Boy take another look,
Take another look,
Take another look,
Take another good, long, look at me.
Love opened my eyes and now I see,
Clouds of gray have silver linings when they reverse.
I found your love,
And that's when the old, gray, cloudburst.
That's when the old, gray, cloud burst!

// Jada //

Jada's coming home.
Jada's coming home. 
She will not cross the Bay bridge, 
But she ain't gone for long.
Jada's coming home.
Jada's quite a gall. 
She's in love with Al.
But he don't love her, no we know,
He is in love with sadly so. 
He's gonna break her heart.
Now when she drives up in that Volvo,
And the horn begins to blow.
I am gonna get out my chair, 
Run down the stairs,
And open up the door.
Jada is my friend.
Don't want to see her hurt again.
'Cause she has such a pretty smile,
Jada is my only child.
Now when she drives up in that Volvo,
And the horn begins to blow.
I am gonna get out my chair, 
Run down the stairs,
And open up the door.
Jada is my friend.
Don't want to see her hurt again.
'Cause she has such a pretty smile,
Jada is my only child.
(het slot is erg moeilijk te verstaan
Maar hier een voorzichtige poging)
Bad I hurt him then, 
And he will hardly have a hope.
Sorrow sitting there, ribbons in her hair,
Such a pretty child, oh what a smile. 
He loves me, he loves me not,
He loves me not, that's what I got.
I taught you all your ABC's, didn't I? 
Here me out. Why don't you leave me at all. 
Boom! She-bop! She's gonna go for the top.  
Sure can't tell her when to stop. 
Easy cause her daddy,
Don't you mess with my daughter.
Jada's coming home.

// River Boulevard //

Walking down the road this morning,
The sun is in my eyes.
The smell of the sweet sweet blossoms
Steps right thru my mind.
And I say

Isn't it just a beautiful day?
Isn't it just a beautiful day?

Passing by familiar houses;
I was getting on close to home,
I could tell by that special feeling,
That was gong down to my soul.
And I say:

Isn't it just a beautiful day?
Isn't it just a beautiful day?

The river was rolling
Gently on it's way.
Sweet little children
Coming out to play.

And it made me feel so happy!
I didn't know what to say, except:
Thank You! for this life I'm living
And the songs I sing today,
And I say:

Isn't it just a beautiful day?
Isn't it just a beautiful day?
Isn't it just a beautiful day?
Isn't it just a beautiful day?
Isn't it just a beautiful day?
Isn't it just a beautiful day?
Isn't it just a beautiful day?
Isn't it just a beautiful day?
