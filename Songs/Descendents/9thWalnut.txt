// Ride The Wild //

You messed around with all my friends and everyone you see
But you're trying to ride the wild when you mess around with me
And all my friends tell me they see you out on the town
They all look down upon you with some pity and a frown

Bankshot baby, I saw through your eyes
I see you run around with a thousand other guys
Tell them all your newly thought up lies

You don't want to be wanted by someone else new
If you can't show some love for me then I don't want to see you
Girl, you got me runnin', why can't you see?

Now lately when I wake, it's on the wrong side of the bed
And I know your voice distinctly, it reverberates in my head
And all my friends tell me they see you out on the town
Tryin' to ride the wild, but the words been passed around

Ride the wild, baby, you like to ride all night
Ride the wild, baby, I'm sure you're not so tired
Come on, baby, now give me a try

You don't want to be wanted by someone else new
If you can't trust a liar, then I don't want to trust you
Girl, you got me running, why can't you see?

Ride the wild, baby, you like to ride all night
Ride the wild, baby, I'm sure you're not so tired
Come on, baby, now give me a try

You don't want to be wanted by someone else new
If you can't trust a liar, then I don't want to trust you
Girl, you got me running

// It's a Hectic World //

It's a hectic world, making me a nervous wreck
It's a hectic world, wish I had no intellect

It's a rat race
God, what a pace
It's a rat race
It's a disgrace

You gotta keep up with the crowd
If you can't be quiet then I gotta be loud

It's a rat race
It's a rat race
It's a rat race

Hey!
You!

Try to get ahead is what I'm supposed to do
No matter what I do, I gotta get ahead of you

It's a rat race
God, what a pace
It's a rat race
It's a disgrace

You gotta keep up with the crowd
If you can't be quiet then I gotta be loud

It's a rat race
It's a rat race
It's a rat race
