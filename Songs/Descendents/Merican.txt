// Here With Me //

Wet sand on a foggy beach, the sky is grey
You would call it a perfect day
And naturally I'd have to agree
If you were here with me

When I'm hanging out with all my friends
Something still holds back my smile
Something tells me they're the enemy, the enemy
'Cause you're not here with me
No, you're not here with me

And I know she was everything
When everybody's having fun
I sit and stare at everyone
Back to myself again

I took a walk outside along the beach
Watch the waves roll along the shore
The things I felt before aren't there anymore, not anymore
'Cause you're not here with me
No, you're not here with me

And everybody's having fun
But not me
I sit and stare at everyone

Back to myself again
Back to myself again

Wet sand on a foggy beach, the sky is grey

Keep workin', stay busy
Don't think about
Don't think about
Keep workin', stay busy
Don't think about
Don't think about her

// I Quit //

Music was my hobby, something that I did for fun

Now that it's become a job, the damage has been done

No amount of money can repair my broken lungs

And who cares what yer makin' if yer makin' it alone


Sick all the time, I miss my wife - I quit

Got better things to do with my life - I quit

I quit - I quit


Go ahead and say it, tell me I'm getting old

Tell me I'm a sellout, but it's you that's being sold

See, I refuse to think of rock and roll as my career

Tell me all my opportunities, ask me if I care


The rock star lifestyle ain't for me - I quit

Got somewhere else I'd rather be, so I quit

I quit - I quit


Go ahead and say it, call me a fuckin' wimp

Just cuz I've got a different kind of life that I wanna live

You can criticize my ideals and my priorities

But ultimately I don't give a flying fuck what you think of me


I don't believe in that macho shit - I quit

I know there's no way you can understand it - I quit

Sick all the time, I miss my wife - I quit

Got better things to do with my life - I quit

I quit - I quit


What'd ya think, I wanted to be Mick Jagger or something,

Playing the pixie at 50 or 60?

Gimme a break!

I mean,I don't wanna grow up and all that, but

The time has come for me to sayâ€¦

I quit

// Alive //

I know I don't control you. 
I know I don't own you, 
But I still feel a sense of pride
'Cause I know what we have is alive. 

It's alive, and it always used to frighten me. 
Now, I know it'll always be a part of me. 
It's alive. 

I know sometimes we're strangers. 
I know there's still some danger,
But I still feel a sense of pride
'Cause I know what we have is alive. 

It's alive, and it always used to frighten me. 
Now, I know it'll always be a part of me. 
It's alive. 

Alive, more than survive, 
More than get by, 
More than our lives. 
It's alive.

I know we'll be together. 
I know -- forever. 
Baby, look into my eyes, 
And you'll know what we have is alive, alive alive. 

It's alive, and it always used to frighten me.
Now, I know it'll always be a part of me. 
Yeah, it's alive, and it always used to frighten me. 
Now, I know it'll always be a part of me. 

It's alive. 
It's alive. 
It's alive.
