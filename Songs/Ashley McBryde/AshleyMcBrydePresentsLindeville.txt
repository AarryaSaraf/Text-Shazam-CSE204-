// Brenda Put Your Bra On //

Brenda, put your bra on, there's trouble next door
Grab a pack of cigarettes and meet me on the porch
Marvin baby mama 'bout to catch him with a whore
Brenda, put your bra on (Bra on, bra on)

I knew she shouldn't let that bitch watch her baby
I used to work with her at the Krystal
She always got them good shifts just 'cause she had good tits
And cut her shirts off at the middle

Brenda, put your bra on, it's just getting good
Shit's goin' down in the trailerhood
Pants 'round his ankles, still sportin' wood
Brenda, put your bra on (Bra on, bra on)
Brenda, put your bra on (Bra on, bra on)

Well, did you hear that? There went the good dishes
I hope they don't knock out the cable
Ole Suntan City won't look quite as pretty
When Tina puts that ass through a table

Brenda, put your bra on, there's trouble next door
Grab a pack of cigarettes and meet me on the porch
Marvin baby mama put that whore on the floor
Brenda, put your bra on (Bra on, bra on)
Brenda, put your bra on (Bra on, bra on)
Put it on

Put it on, shit

Brenda, put your bra on, here comes Channel 4
We ain't never been on the TV before
Grab the marijuana, stick it down your drawers
Brenda, put your bra on (Bra on, bra on)
Brenda, put your bra on (Bra on, bra on)
Brenda, put your bra on (Bra on, bra on)
Brenda, put your bra on

// Jesus Jenny //

Jesus Jenny
What the hell's gotten into you
Girl you've got a lot to lose
In the morning you've got work to do
Jesus Jenny
God damnit its Monday night
You're fucked up on vodka and sprite
Can't even cuss me right

I ain't saying I'm a saint
But I'm living proof a heart can change
And honey I ain't judging
But I can just say nothing
All I can do for you right now is pray
To Jesus Jenny

Titties popping out your turtleneck
You're riding around in your red corvette
Getting all the wrong kinds of respect
Jesus Jenny
Shit I wouldn't want your man to see
The way you keep looking at me
Don't do him like you did me
Jesus Jenny

I ain't saying I'm a saint
But I'm living proof a heart can change
And honey I ain't judging
But I can just say nothing
All I can do for you right now is pray
That your demons go away
That you get home ok
I ain't saying
I'm just saying
Jesus Jenny
Jenny you're drunk
Jenny go home
Blah blah blah blah

// Dandelion Diner //

It's high time for pie time at the Dandelion Diner
It's high time for pie time at the Dandelion Diner
Blueberry, strawberry, rhubarb too
Butterscotch or chicken pot
We got the pie for you
Yes it's high time for pie time at the Dandelion Diner

// The Girl In The Picture //

She didn't see the flash
Her makeup wasn't perfect
Purse slung on her chair
Cigarette hand in her hair
A thousand-mile stare
Just sittin' there

If looks could kill, she'd be killin' it killin' it
Oh, but life ain't fair
If hearts could spill, she'd be spillin' it spillin' it
On the tablecloth right there
It's a shame that all she'll ever be
Is the girl in the picture
That won the blue ribbon
At the Faulkner County fair

Naw, she didn't dance
But not 'cause nobody asked her
She just sat and laughed
Like the bubbles in her glass
Disappearing like her happy ever after

If looks could kill, she'd be killin' it killin' it
Oh, but life ain't fair
If hearts could spill, she'd be spillin' it spillin' it
On the tablecloth right there
It's a shame that all she'll ever be
Is the girl in the picture
That won the blue ribbon
At the Faulkner County fair

Shouldn't be a prize
For catching the last smile of a girl named Caroline

If looks could kill, she'd be killin' it killin' it
Oh, but life ain't fair
If hearts could spill, she'd be spillin' it spillin' it
On the tablecloth right there
It's a shame that all she'll ever be
Is the girl in the picture
That won the blue ribbon
At the Faulkner County fair
At the Faulkner County fair

// If These Dogs Could Talk //

There's a three-legged beagle who lays there spread eagle
On the driveway outside Patti's trailer
He looks like he's sleepin' but he knows she's dealin'
And that she's been bonin' the neighbor
There's a mean little poodle we call cranky doodle
Ridin' high in Lynnette's Vera Bradley
And he'll take to the grave that her husband is gay
Cause doodle likes chewin' his panties

If these dogs could talk
They'd sure tell on you
We're all lucky barkin' is all they can do
They dig up your secrets, they know all your trash
The tales they could tell, the tongues they could wag
God knows what they'd say
Might ruin your day
If these dogs could talk

There's a brown one named Patience
She always waitin' for scraps outside of the diner
Leroy is servin', one thing's for certain
A hamburger steak always finds her
He may be a meth head who smokes up his paycheck
But everyone needs a best friend
And she may be blind, but she sees him just fine
And don't care what they say about him

If these dogs could talk
They'd sure tell on you
We're all lucky barkin' is all they can do
They dig up your secrets, they know all your trash
The tales they could tell, the tongues they could wag
God knows what they'd say
Might ruin your day
If these dogs could talk

They could sniff out the cheaters and point out the liars
Shit on their lawns and piss on their tires
They can smell kindness so maybe be kinder
And don't even think about kickin' one

They dig up your secrets, they know all your trash
The tales they could tell, the tongues they could wag
God knows what they'd say
Might ruin your day
If these dogs could talk

God knows what they'd say
Might make someone's day if these dogs could talk

// Play Ball //

Pete chalks the ballfields down at Dennis Linde park
Turns the sprinklers on at sun-up and the lights on after dark
If you got time to talk, he'll give you his two cents
The grass is always greener on his side of the fence
Yeah

He lost his wife to cancer and a thumb in Vietnam
Jokes he used to be a hitchhiker but not for very long
He runs off the gophers in a golf cart full of dents
And the grass is always greener cause he makes sure it is
Yeah

Says you're old as you feel, and I feel 35
And any day you wake up's a damn good day to be alive
Soak it in when you win 'cause you can't win 'em all
Go to church, love your mama
And play ball

I broke into concessions once, but he didn't call the cops
He just made me clean the grease traps and replace the bubble pops
That's the spring that daddy left, he knew I was actin' out
And when I hit my first homerun, he took me to Golden Corral
Yeah

Says you're old as you feel, and I feel 35
And any day you wake up's a damn good day to be alive
Soak it in when you win 'cause you can't win 'em all
Go to church, love your mama
And play ball

Someone to put the time in or fill an empty seat
The world would be a better place if we all had a Pete

// The Missed Connection Section Of The Lindeville Gazette //

For all you lovebirds out there, this is What the Fuzz Radio
And now the brand-new hit, straight off the press, guys
Here is "The Missed Connection Section of the Lindeville Gazette"

You were wearin' a sparkly top
At the Food City, Tuesday night
I saw you grab a case of beer
How'd you know I only drink Bud Light?
Well, I got avocados
And I know you got some limes
What you say maybe me and you
Make a little guac sometime?

Man seekin' woman
Twenty-five to forty-four
Cool if separated
Even better if divorced
I didn't catch your number
So I'll give you mine
Man seekin' woman
Who won't tell his wife

I felt your eyes burnin' through me
All the way down aisle three
Felt your strong arm brush against me
When you reached for them beans
You must be makin' nachos
I know I'm not yours, but
I got some jalape√±os
Boy, if you wanna spice it up

Woman seekin' a man
For just an hour or two
Don't have to be the Hilton
That SuperCab will do
If you're free on Thursday
Well, I ain't doin' nothin'
Woman seekin' a man
That won't tell her husband

(Never done it like that before)

Man seekin' woman
Woman seekin' a man
Just a low-down distraction
From a pawn shop weddin' band
When you ain't gettin' any
You get it where you can
A man seekin' woman
Woman seekin' a man
Man seekin' woman
Woman seekin' a man

// Gospel Night At The Strip Club //

It's gospel night at the strip club
Been sleepin' in my car
I lead the singin' service with a half-ass tuned guitar
Brandy's singin' backup while Lonnie's tendin' bar
Just waitin' for more sinners to show up

Crystal just started dancin'
She's always right on point
She don't mind if you don't tip her
As long as you slip her a joint
Patti's got an upper
To get her through her shift
And a downer so she can lay down with the kids

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Jesus loves the drunkards and the whores and the queers
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Would you recognize him if he bought you a beer

Lonnie he's a listener
He shoulda been a priest
It's the same confession on a barstool or your knees
He makes a mean Manhattan but he ain't drank since '93
Does the last call benediction then wipes the bar slate clean

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Jesus loves the drunkards and the whores and the queers
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Would you recognize him if he bought you a beer

The same old dirty dollars, keep gettin' passed around
To whoever needs 'em most and I guess that's me right now
Cause I'm starin' at this Jackson someone laid here at my feet
That's gas in my ol Honda and somethin' warm to eat

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Jesus loves the drunkards and the whores and the queers
Hallelujah, hallelujah
He laid down a twenty and then he disappeared

// When Will I Be Loved //

I've been cheated, been mistreated
When will I be loved?
I've been put down, I've been pushed 'round
When will I be loved?

When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time

I've been made blue, I've been lied to
When will I be loved?

When I find a new man
That I want for mine
He always breaks my heart in two
It happens every time

I've been cheated, been mistreated
When will I be loved?
When will I be loved?
When will I be loved?

Tell me, when will I be loved?

// Bonfire At Tina's //

Small town women ain't built to get along
But you burn one, boy, you burn us all
We'll be here drinking 'til the smoke is gone

You don't feel pretty (Light it up)
You've been lonely (Light it up)
He's so damn lazy (Light it up)
My step-kids hate me (Light it up)

And when it's gone to ashes, we'll be laughing, fall down drunk
If we fall down on our asses, hell, we'll pick each other up

Small town women ain't built to get along
But you burn one, boy, you burn us all
We'll be here drinking 'til the smoke is gone
Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh
Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh

You got cheated on (Light it up)
Don't get paid enough (Light it up)
Don't get laid enough (Light it up)
Got a joint (Light it up)

Small town women ain't built to get along
But you burn one, boy, you burn us all
We'll be here drinking 'til the smoke is gone
Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh
Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh

When memory comes around, yeah, we'll go back to talking shit
But tonight, we're all just bitches that are sick of taking it (Bonfire at)

Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh
Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh
Oh, small town women ain't built to get along (Oh-oh-oh)
But you burn one, boy, you burn us all
We'll be here drinking 'til the smoke is gone (Oh-oh-oh)
Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh
Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh
Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh
Bonfire at Tina's, oh-oh-oh

// Lindeville //

The dogs are howlin' at the moon tonight
The breeze is blowin' through the trees just right
And I'm way up here with the whippoorwills
And there's nothing but stars over Lindeville
Nothing but starts over Lindeville

Betty had just one glass of wine
She's alright, but just feeling fine
And Patti fell asleep without her pills
There's nothing but stars over Lindeville
There's nothing but stars over Lindeville

Leroy and Patience layin' down for rest
Her little brown face layin' on his chest
He misses Caroline, he always will
Cause there's one more star over Lindeville
There's one more star over Lindeville

And I've seen parades
And I've seen fire
Watching over this ole town
Like a bird on a wire

I've been keeping time on the courthouse square
Since their Daddy's Daddy's put me here
And tonight I wish I could just stand still
Cause look at those stars over Lindeville
There's nothing but stars over Lindeville
