// Levitating (The Blessed Madonna Remix) //

If you wanna run away with me
I know a galaxy and I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way is separating
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you, all night
Come on, dance with me
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you, all night
Come on, dance with me

I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see it written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far

Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever, every time we get together
No, we're never gonna be apart

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way is separating
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you, all night
Come on, dance with me
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you, all night
Come on, dance with me (Come on, dance with me)

You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
(Let me take you for a ride)
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
(Can't stop it, baby) let's go!

Boy, I'm advanced, got my real tight pants
When I back it up I put you in a trance
If you wanna dance then show me all your bands
'Cause tonight I might give you that chance
(Let's get it, skrrt) Pull up in the coupe
Ooh, that dude, he look hella cute
Yeah, he looking at me like, ooh
Say my breasts like Betty Boop
Oh my, my, my
Get to sweltering like ay-ay-ay
I'm a freak, I like to play shy
But I will get it poppin', anything I'll try it
Say I'm on his top five list
On a Major Key like Kylie
Don't speak, open up your eyelids
(I can be your girl if you keep it private)

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way is separating
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you, all night
Come on, dance with me
(Come on, dance with me)

You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride

You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride

Come on, come on, come on dance with me

Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name

Put you in my hall of fame, middle of the wall
Yeah, you're my one, my favourite, my ride or die, oh

// Don't Start Now (Kaytranada Remix) //

Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)

Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now (Oh)
Up, up
Don't come out, out
Walk away, walk away
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody (Somebody)
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me (Stop me)

Don't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)
Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)
Don't start caring about me now (So)

Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away (So)
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away, oh
Walk away, oh
Walk away

// Love Is Religion (The Blessed Madonna Remix) //

I see the lights
Dancing, dancing in your eyes
So how do I begin to tell you now
That I can be the one to bring your angel out?
In this life of sin

I can be your muse, I can be your ally
I can be your moon, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven tonight
Put your hands together and close your eyes

Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
They say love is religion

There's a fire
Rising in my heart like a choir
I can hear them singing our favourite song
The one that played while I was layin' in your arms
Just let me stay in your arms 'cause

I can be your gold, I can be your delight
I can be feed your soul, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven for life
Put your hands together and close your eyes

Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me

(Love is a religion)
Put your hands together and close your eyes
(Love is a religion)
Put your hands together and close your eyes
(Love is a religion)
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
(Love is a religion)
Put your hands together and close your eyes

They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
They say love is religion
(Put your hands together and close your eyes)
They say love is religion

// Pretty Please (Masters At Work Remix) //

Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah

I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please

Exactly where I want me, yeah
Underneath your body, yeah
If we take it further, I swear I ain't gonna break
So, baby, come try me
Baby, come find me
Baby, don't wind me up

I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
When your kisses climb
Oh, you give me sweet relief
Made me feel so pretty
Would you help me out, please? (Woo)

Hate it when you leave me unattended

Every single night, I need your hands on me
When your kisses climb
Oh, you give me sweet relief

// Good In Bed (Gen Hoshino Remix) //

Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but

I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

I dedicate this verse to
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah
You always let me down, boy
But when you're going down, I get so up
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do

I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

Yeah, we don't know how to talk
But damn, we know how to fu...

I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn (Goddamn), you got me in love again

Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn (Goddamn), you got me in love again
You got me in love again

// Cool (Jayda G Remix) //

Guess I never had a love like this
Hit me harder than I ever expected
We been up all goddamn night, all night, all night
Keep it going till we see the sunlight

And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby, I could see us in the real life
You know, you know you got

Got me losin' all my cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We'll get the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool
I guess we're ready for the summer

I like us better when we're intertwined
The way you touch me got me losin' my senses (Ah-ah)
Put your love with your lips on mine, on mine, on mine
You got me working up an appetite-tite

And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby, I could see us in the real life
You know, you know you got

Got me losin' all my cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We'll get the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool

Skintight
I'll show you heaven, there's nothing better
I'll give it to you all night
You know, you know, you know
Got me losin' all my cool
Yeah, you like the way I move
In control of what I do
And my love makes you brand new

Got me losin' all my cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We'll get the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you

Hey, go
Woo, yeah

// Don't Start Now (Yaeji Remix) //

Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me now
Don't start caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Don't start caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me now
Don't start caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me now

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me now
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Don't start caring about me now
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me

// Pretty Please (Midland Refix) //

-Lief, pretty
-Lief, pretty
Oh, you look so pretty
-Lief, pretty
Put my mind at
-Lief, pretty
Put my mind at
Pretty
Put my mind at

Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window (Gonna break, gonna break)

Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please
Pretty

Exactly where I want me, yeah
Underneath your body, yeah
If we take it further, I swear I ain't gonna break
So, baby, come try me
Baby, come find me
Baby, don't wind me up

Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me

I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please
Pretty
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me

Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Put my mind at ease
Put my mind at ease
Put my mind at ease
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me

// Good In Bed (Zach Witness Remix) //

Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but

I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

I know it's really bad
Messing with my head
We drive each other mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me
I know it's really bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

Ahh
Mmm
Hey, ah

I dedicate this verse to (Verse to)
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah (Oh)
You always let me down, boy (Oh, oh)
But when you're going down, I get so up (So up)
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do

I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist (Ah-ha)

I know it's really bad
Messing with my head
We drive each other mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me
I know it's really bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

Ahh
That's what makes us good in bed
Hey, ahh

Sometimes I think about you, you know?
I can't get you out of my mind
It's like an addiction
I can't stop
I love you

Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
