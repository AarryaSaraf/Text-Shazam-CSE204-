// Show Some Respect //

I made a resolution and I plan to keep my word
But I need you to make it work
You've got to read the message
Understand what's on my mind
'Cause not to see would be a crime
And we could lose it anytime

We've got to show some respect
We've got to learn to protect
Don't take it for granted, I know
That if you want to stay close
We've got to show some respect

But I believe in working, then I believe in a little help
'Cause I'm not a light unto myself
Without a thing of value, why settle for second best
We don't know what's up ahead
And we can't let ourselves forget

We've got to show some respect
We've got to learn to protect
Don't take it for granted, I know
That if you want to stay close
We've got to show some respect

For the things that I love about you
From the woman that you see inside
Don't let it walk out the door
Love follows every time

We've got to show some respect
We've got to learn to protect
Don't take it for granted, I know
That if you want to stay close
We've got to show some respect

// Steel Claw //

It's the story of a steel claw

It's just a television wonderland
Just one more
Fairy tale about some rich bitch
Lying by the swimming pool
Life is so cruel
Easy living when you make the rules
Last Friday was the first time
It took only about half a minute
On the stairway
It was child's play
The odds turn out even
When you give up believing in the

Cold law, steel claw
Try to get on board you find the lock is on the door
Well I say no way, no way!
Don't try to get out or there'll be hell to pay
I don't know who's right, who's wrong
But it really doesn't matter when you're lying in the gutter
It's a see-saw
A long hot battle with the cold law
Is what you get for messing with the steel claw

The politicians have forgotten this place
Except for flying visits in a black Mercedes
At election time
They cross the line
And everybody runs to watch the pantomime
If they could see what's going on around here
So many people hanging on the edge
Crying out for revolution
Retribution
The odds turn out even
When you give up believing in the

Cold law, steel claw
Try to get on board you find the lock is on the door
Well I say no way, no way!
Don't try to get out or there'll be hell to pay
I don't know who's right, who's wrong
But it really doesn't matter when you're lying in the gutter
It's a see-saw
A long hot battle with the cold law
Is what you get for messing with the steel claw

Sometimes I think I'm going crazy
Sometimes I do a line, makes me laugh
Makes me want to take a joyride
On the high tide
Sometimes I'm contemplating suicide
Meanwhile Eddy's on the West Coast now
He's making out with some sweet seÃ±orita
Up in 'Frisco, you and I know
The odds turn out even
When you give up believing in the

Cold law, steel claw
Try to get on board you find the lock is on the door
Well I say no way, no way!
Don't try to get out or there'll be hell to pay
I don't know who's right, who's wrong
But it really doesn't matter when you're lying in the gutter
It's a see-saw
A long hot battle with the cold law
Is what you get for messing with the steel claw
It's cold law, steel claw
Try to get on board you find the lock is on the door
Well I say no way, no way!
Cold law
When you give up believing in the cold law, steel claw

// Help //

When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self-assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never did before

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self-assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
Won't you please, please help me?

Oh please, please
Won't you please help me? Ooh
