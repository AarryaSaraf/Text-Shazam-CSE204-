// Care //

It's been a while since I've talked about it
Maybe it's time to co-operate
I need some help to forget about it
I don't want your sympathy
Stop saying you give a shit
Because you don't really care
Care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah

It's been a while since I've thought about it
Maybe it's time to communicate
I was seven to think about it
The fact I still can't forget about it
I don't want your sympathy
I guess I've had it rough
But you don't really care
Care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah

Oh, by the way I'm still the same
I'm still the same
But are you the same?
Oh, by the way I'm still the same
I'm still the same
But are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Forget about it

I don't want your sympathy
I guess I've had it rough
But you don't really care
Care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah

Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Oh-oh, oh-oh
You, you-ou

Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you?

// Worth It //

Your eyes are just like his but your face is a bit different
You're a bit more fucked but I guess that's fine
Maybe, that's what I want this time

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

This is too bad to boast
But this is my way to float
And if I shut up I'm scared I'll drown
But maybe that's the best for now

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

Don't think this is worth it
Don't think this is worth it
I'm not wasting time
But you've been on my mind
Don't think this is worth it
This time

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

// Dye It Red //

Kiss my ass, you don't know jack
And if you say you understand you don't
You don't
You don't
You don't

Fuck me, only when I'm keen
Not according to your beer
Your beer
Your beer
Your beer

So let me be what I've wanted to be

So let me cut my hair and dye it red if I want to
I haven't found myself so comfortable
I'm not stopping now

Touch me as if you mean it
Because I'm getting tired of being all alone
Alone
Alone
Alone

And if it's not for you guess I'll find it on my own

So let me cut my hair and dye it red if I want to
I haven't found myself so comfortable
I'm not stopping

Think I'd be better off alone
Now that I had some time to think
I've had to put up with your shit
When you're not even that cute

And maybe it's time to change my ways
But that doesn't include you

Let me cut my hair and dye it red if I want to
I haven't found myself so comfortable
I'm not stopping

Think I'd be better off alone
Now that I had some time to think
I've had to put up with your shit
When you're not even that cute

That cute
That cute
That cute

// Back To Mars //

Ask me again, are we friends or are we something more?
Doesn't it hurt to think about how we were just before?
Doesn't matter if sometimes we cannot stick to being friends
Doesn't matter if we break up just to act all fine again

Take me to the South of France where we could just be old friends
We'd go to the beach and you could braid my hair
You could braid my hair

// Emo Song //

Back on old ways, I know your face
I haven't seen you in some days
It hurts my head, my conscience dead
The fact I miss the way it felt

You're coming back again
Don't want you back again

You call me up and lie again
Like all the men I use to trust
Nobody knows when I was young
I lost my self in cosmic dust

You're coming back again
Don't want you back again

Just the thought of you doesn't stop
You're not a person or a thing
Just the thought of you on my limbs
It's all your fault
It's all your fault
It's all your fault
It's all your fault

// Further Away //

Say what you want
It's hard 'cause it sucks
I'll just pretend to give a fuck
Maybe then you'll try to stop

'Cause was it so hard
To keep your mouth shut?
They say the moon's miles away but your brain's further away

Who's laughing now?
The shit that you used to say is out your mouth
Guess you feel better now?

'Cause was it so hard
To keep your mouth shut?
They say the moon's miles away but your brain's further away

Further away
Further away
Further away

// Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene //

He-, hold up, fuck
He-, what the fuck?
Sounds like a fart
(One, two, three, four)

He smells very nice
Oh so nice
Wears clothes that I like
He doesn't even try
He doesn't even try

And I think that I want to marry him
But I really don't want to freak him out
I know all our children's names
They're called Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

Loves me till I die
I'll be his corpse bride
And when I smell he says it's fine
Oh how nice

And I think that I want to marry him
But I really don't want to freak him out
I know all our children's names
They're called Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

I'm scared he's gonna leave me
'Cause when I'm mad I get pretty scary
But he won't and he won't because I'm pretty
And we'll have lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots
Of babies

Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

// First Date //

Meet me by the corner shop
The one that sells the flower pot
To tell me that you bought it with your cash
And not your mother's coupons

Build a rocket ship out of soft clay
And take me right up into space
And I can see how our day went
We'll see if we're just friends

'Cause I know you know
It's still pretty awkward
Grow some balls and just say
Where'd you wanna go, where'd you
Where'd you wanna go on our first date?
