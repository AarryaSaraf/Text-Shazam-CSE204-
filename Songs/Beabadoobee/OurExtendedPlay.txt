// Last Day On Earth //

You made it
It's your last day on Earth
You killed someone last night
And burned down a church
Oh, you made it
For what it's worth
Well, and if it all goes wrong
And it looks like we'll soon be gone
Then we should all just get along
And sing a song I wrote
And it goes like this, it goes

Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo, oh yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo, oh yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You made it along
You got a problem with Peter, you got a problem with John
You can't go on
All this follow me shit
I want to get fucked up at home
Be naked alone
And turn up my phone
Because this song I wrote is just so fucking sick, it goes...
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Wait, I got something to say
(What's that? Oh shit)
I forgot, wait a minute
The world's about to end so I'm gonna have to finish
I guess if it were nicer, we'd be better off innit?
I haven't got a plan, so I'm think I'm gonna wing it
Naked, alone with this song I wrote and it goes like this
It goes

Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo, oh yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo, oh yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo, oh yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo, oh yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

// Cologne //

Am I seductive?
Call me back in an hour
If you wanna go back home
Oh babe, at least leave the scent of your cologne
Leave the scent of your cologne

I'm not done yet
Please kiss my neck
Let's go for another round
I hate what this song is about

Am I attractive?
Tell me, am I good enough?
Lately I've been on and off
I think I've heard too much, my wrists are numb
Heard too much, my limbs are numb

I'm not done yet
Please kiss my neck
Let's go for another round
I hate what this song is about

You're in my head
You're in my head
Fuck

I'm so attractive
Think I'm going to explode
Baby, I've been hung around
Won't you just drop your shit and pick up the phone?
Drop your shit and pick up the phone

I'm not done yet
Please kiss my neck
Let's go for another round
I hate what this song is about

// Animal Noises //

I'm still afraid of the dark
But mornings are scarier
'Cause when I'm awake, I spend half of my day
Wondering what to do
I'll miss the 9 a.m train
'Cause I slept through my alarm again
Forgetting to eat is affecting my sleep
But I guess that's just part of the trend

I miss the mornings I spent making animal noises with you
I just need someone to hold but I guess that I'm getting too old
It's something I keep getting told
I guess that I'm getting too old for this

Well, I guess that I've made some mistakes
And you know that I've told a few lies
If I call in the morning, I know you'd be boring
And say my behavior's alright
Maybe you like my mistakes
And maybe I get what I like
Maybe the things that made you wanna live
Were the things that made me wanna die

I miss the mornings I spent making animal noises with you
I just need someone to hold but I guess that I'm getting too old
It's something I keep getting told
I guess that I'm getting too old for this

For this
I'm too old for this
For this
Ah, ah, ah

I miss the mornings I spent making animal noises with you
I just need someone to hold but I guess that I'm getting too old
It's something I keep getting told
I guess that I'm getting too old for this
