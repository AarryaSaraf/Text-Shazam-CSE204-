// I Wanna Be Your Lover //

I ain't got no money
I ain't like those other guys you hang around
And it's kinda funny
But they always seem to let you down
And I get discouraged
'cause I never see you anymore
And I need your love, babe yeah
That's all I'm living for, yeah
I didn't wanna pressure you, baby
But all I ever wanted to do
I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come running
I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out, all night long, make you shout
Oh, lover! Yeah
I wanna be the only one you come for

I wanna be your brother
I wanna be your mother and your sister, too
There ain't no other
That can do the things that I'll do to you
And I get discouraged
'cause you treat me just like a child
And they say I'm so shy, yeah
But with you I just go wild!
I didn't wanna pressure you, baby. No!
But all I ever wanted to do

I wanna be your lover
I wanna be the only one that makes you come running
I wanna be your lover
I wanna turn you on, turn you out, all night long make you shout
Oh, lover! Yeah
I wanna be the only one you come for, yeah

// Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad? //

There's some talk going 'round town
That you really don't give a damn
They say you really put me down
When I'm doing the best I can
I gave you all of my love
I even gave you my body
Tell me, baby, ain't that enough?
What more do you want me to do?
I play the fool when we're together
But I cry when we're apart, yeah
I couldn't do you no better
Don't break what left of my broken heart, baby

Why you wanna treat me so bad
When you know I love you?
How can you do this to me
When you know I care?
Why you wanna treat me so bad
When you know I love you?

You know, I try so hard
To keep you satisfied
Sometimes you play the part
Sometimes you're so full of pride
And if it's still good to ya
Why you wanna treat me so bad?
You used to love it when I'd do you
You used to say I was the best you'd ever had

I play the fool when we're together
I give you everything I can, yeah
And if it's still good to ya
There's something that I can't understand

Why you wanna treat me so bad
When you know I love you?
How can you do this to me
When you know I care?
Why you wanna treat me so bad
When you know I love you?

// Sexy Dancer //

Sexy dancer
Sexy dancer
Sexy dancer, you got my body screamin'
Sexy dancer, you got me just-a-creamin'
Sexy dancer, when you rub my body
Sexy dancer, it gets me so hot...hot!
Sexy dancer, sexy dancer
Sexy dancer, sexy dancer

Sexy dancer, I want your body, want your body
Sexy dancer, dance
Sexy dancer, I want your body, want your body
Sexy dancer, dance
Sexy dancer, I want your body, want your body
Sexy dancer, dance
Sexy dancer, I want your body, want your body
Sexy dancer, dance

Sexy dancer, do that sexy dance
Sexy dancer

Sexy dancer, sexy dancer
Sexy dancer, sexy dancer
Hot!

// When We're Dancing Close And Slow //

When we're dancing close and slow
I never want to let you go, no, no
I feel your warm embrace
The softness of your face
Tell me, baby, are we here alone?
When we're kissing long and hard
I can almost taste the thoughts within your mind
Sex-related fantasy is all that my mind can see
Baby, that's honestly the way I feel

When we're dancing close and slow
I'm not afraid to let my feelings show
I want to come inside of you
I want to hold you when we're through
Can't you feel my love touching you?

// With You //

I've held your hand so many times
But I still get the feeling I felt the very first time
I've kissed your lips and laid with you
And I cherish every moment we spend in each other's arms
I guess my eyes can only see as far as you
I only want to be with you

We've come so far in so little time
Sometimes I wonder if this is meant to be
Sometimes you are so very kind
That the nights you're not with me I'm scared that you're gonna leave

I guess you could say that I'm just being a fool
But I only want to be with you

I guess you could say that I'm just being a fool
But I always, always want to be with you

// Bambi //

I knew from the start
That I loved you with all my heart
But you were untrue.
You had another lover and she looked just like you
Bambi, can't you understand?
Bambi, it's better with a man

It's so hard to believe
Maybe it's because you're so young
Or maybe I'm just too naive
Who's to say, maybe you're really having fun

Bambi, can't you understand?
Bambi, it's better with a man

All your lovers - they look just like you
But they can only do the things that you do
Come on, baby, and take me by the hand
I'm gonna show what it's like to be loved by a man

Bambi, I know what you need
Bambi, maybe you need to bleed

Yeah!

// Still Waiting //

All my friends tell me
About the loves they've had
Can't they see what they're doing to me?
It makes me feel so bad
'Cause I'm so alone
And brokenhearted
It ain't like my life is ended
But more like it never started
The love my friends rap about I keep anticipating
I try so hard but don't you know, my patience is fading away
Still waiting
I'm waiting for that love
Still waiting
I wish on every star above
Still waiting
Waiting for the love to come around
Oh, love.
Waiting for the love to come around

People say that I'm too young
Too young to fall in love
But they don't know, they really don't know
That's all that I've been dreaming of
'Cause I spend my nights just a-crying
And I spend my days just a-trying
To find that love to call my own
'Cause I'm sick and tired of being alone

Still waiting
Waiting for that love
Still waiting
I wish on every star above
Still waiting
I'm waiting for the love to come around.
(Waiting for the love) Don't you know that I'm waiting
(Waiting for the love) Say..
(Waiting for the love) To come around now

I need somebody to hold on to baby
Waiting and waiting, don't you know that I'm

Still waiting
I'm waiting for the love, sugar
Still waiting
If you're out there girl, please come to me
Still waiting
Don't make me cry no more
Still waiting
If you're out there, baby, please come to me
Still waiting
Wishing and wishing for days, baby
Still waiting
If you're out there, girl, please come to me
Still waiting

// I Feel For You //

Baby, baby, when I look at you
I get a warm feeling inside
There's something about the things you do
That keeps me satisfied
I wouldn't lie to you, baby
It's mainly a physical thing
This feeling that I got for you, baby
It makes me wanna sing
I feel for you - I think I love you
I feel for you - I think I love you

Baby, baby, when I lay wit' you
There's no place I'd rather be
I can't believe, can't believe it's true
The things that you do to me
I wouldn't lie to you, baby
I'm physically attracted to you
This feeling that I got for you, baby (Ooh baby)
There's nothing that I wouldn't do (for you girl)

I feel for you - I think I love you
I feel for you - I think I love you

Play

I think it's love
I feel for you - I think it's love
I feel for you - I think I love you
I feel for you - I think it's love

Play

I feel for you - I think I love you
I feel for you - I think I love you

// It's Gonna Be Lonely //

We've been together for quite some time
I'd think by now you'd know
It would take forever to get you off my mind
If ever you decide to go
I guess I got a little insecurity when it's concerning you
I guess I'm just afraid that if you ever leave
I'd be in a messed-up state of blue
And I'd be so lonely

Without you loving me
I know it's gonna be lonely
Without you giving me everylittlesinglething that I need, lonely

Whatever's in your kiss, it really turns me on
'til I go right out of my mind
And who could ever resist your accent from gay Paree
It gets me every time
I betcha thatcha never knew that in my dreams you are the star
The only bummer is that you always want to leave
Who do you think you are

Don't you know it's gonna be lonely
Without you loving me
I know it's gonna be lonely
Without you giving me everylittlesinglething that I need, lonely

It's gonna be lonely

Without you loving me
Giving me everything that I need
Oh pretty baby, can't you see
It's gonna be lonely

Without you loving me
I know, I know it's gonna be lonely
Oh, whatever's in your kiss
I never could resist
Oh, baby don't go!

We've been together for quite some time
It'd take forever to get you off my mind
Oh, girl!

Without you loving me
I know it's gonna be lonely
Without you by my side
Don't you know that I could die, baby

Without you loving me
Can't you see
It's gonna be lonely

It's gonna be lonely, baby
So lonely, baby
