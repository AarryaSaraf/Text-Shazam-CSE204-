// Ride //

[Spoken introduction:]
I was in the winter of my life, and the men I met along the road were my only summer
At night I fell asleep with visions of myself, dancing and laughing and crying with them
Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour, and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me, and my only real happy times
I was a singer. Not a very popular one
I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet, but upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky that I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken
But I didn't really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted, and then losing it to know what true freedom is
When the people I used to know found out what I had been doing, how I'd been living, they asked me "Why?", but there's no use in talking to people who have home
They have no idea what it's like to seek safety in other people, for home to be wherever you lay your head
I was always an unusual girl
My mother told me I had a chameleon soul, no moral compass pointing due north, no fixed personality; just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean
And if I said I didn't plan for it to turn out this way I'd be lying
Because I was born to be the other woman
Who belonged to no one, who belonged to everyone
Who had nothing, who wanted everything, with a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn't even talk about it, and pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me

I been out on that open road
But you can be my full-time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
But you can be my full-time baby, hot or cold

Don't break me down (Don't break me down)
I been traveling too long (I been traveling too long)
I been trying too hard (I been trying too hard)
With one pretty song (With one pretty song)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life and art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it, light 'til dark

Don't leave me now (Don't leave me now)
Don't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)
Don't turn around (Don't turn around)
Leave me high and dry (Leave me high and dry)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

[Spoken ending:]
Every night I used to pray that I'd find my people, and finally I did on the open road
We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore, except to make our lives into a work of art
Live fast. Die young. Be wild. And have fun
I believe in the country America used to be
I believe in the person I want to become
I believe in the freedom of the open road
And my motto is the same as ever:
"I believe in the kindness of strangers. And when I'm at war with myself I ride, I just ride."
Who are you?
Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies?
Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?
I have. I am fucking crazy
But I am free

// 1949 //

Carry me up them stairs
With my white socks on
And my pretty song
You like my blue nail polish?
What is all this? You said
Of the mess upstairs
Don't be scared

Daddy dearest, you know
How I like to take trips
Pops, first stops at the K-Mart, buy me my peach lip-gloss
Cigarettes and lollipops
For our trip across the USA

We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Gonna party like it's 1949

Carry me up the stairs
With my white socks on
And my blonde hair long
You like my pin-up bodice and the solace
That comes with the midnight air
And my icy stare

It's the clearest when it's me and him alone
He stops, he talks about all the ways he used
To about all ways he used to [?]
Dinerettes and soda pops for our trip across the USA

We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Gonna party like it's 1949

Daddy likes Blackpool Pleasure Beach and road stops
Me, I like the Swiss Alps souvenir gift shops
Late night, midnight radio show talks
Him and me, a big jailbreak

Ponytail and lollipops, dinerettes and soda pops
New blue bathing suit, ruched tops and Cadillacs
Blue lake, Carter Docks, hopscotch, hot talk
Alabama hard knocks, motel brass locks

// Afraid //

I'm America's sweetheart
Tryna get away
You make it hard to leave
But it's easier for me to stay
Why I'm so afraid

And I've had it up to here
With the fighting, baby, we're
Not fooling anyone these days
I don't wanna stray
But boy, I'm so afraid

But it's not love that keeps me here
And it's not what you want to hear

So I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
Thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid

We were just teenagers when we fell in love
Driving in your fast car
Looking at the stars above
But it was not enough
You should never come between
A woman and her dream
And a man who never knew his place
There's no easy way
To come back from where you came

So, I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
I-I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
Nothing in your heart, boy
I thought that I could make you change
But I'm so afraid

And it's not love, it's just the fear
That you've put down for all these years

But I'm leaving now
I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
I am done being afraid
Oh, I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
I thought that I could make you change
But I'm so afraid

Oh, it's not love that keeps me here
It's not love that keeps me here
I'm done being afraid
I'm done being afraid
Oh, oh, oh

// All Smiles //

All dressed up, with nowhere to go
That's the story of the girl you know
Me
I'm all smiles but inside I frown
'Cause I've seen you walking around with Betty Lou
Didn't I tell you what I heard about her?

It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you what them other girls do
You'll date anyone, you'll date anyone

Are they more fun than me, baby?
I'm smiling, the New Jersey queen
And you're the best thing I ever seen
So won't you pull up your white corvette
Jimmy, let me get a better look at your face
I know it ain't doing
But I know what you like
So come on inside and I'll fix you ice-cream
A little banana split for you, Jim

You're so fine, you're like silk la roux
Guess that's why you keep slipping through my fingers
You're the state's number one
Everybody knows it
You smile all the time
'Cause how can you not show it
When even you know
That you're so
To die for, to die for
What do I need to get high for?
When I have you
When I have you

It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you what those other girls done
I'm gonna prove to you
I'm gonna prove to you
You'll never find nobody more fun

Dah, dah, dah
More fun

// Architecture //

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the Houses of the Holy, smoking on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck, he was cool as heck

Tell me how life treats you now

// Beautiful Player //

Uh, what? Starz, Starz
Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey
Sing it to me, sing it to me

You're so easy to love
You make me cuckoo like a turtle dove
So hot that I can't get enough, enough of you
Hit me and it felt like a kiss
You know it hurts so good, when you do me like this
So sad when I hear the girls talk
When I walk by, I start to cry-y-y

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause you're a beautiful player
You're a beautiful player, baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah, ah
(Sing it to me, doll)

Sunset on a Saturday night
Having a drop-top 'bach-ride time of our lives
He's selling souls on the boulevard of broken dreams
And faded queens
Live young like we oughta die fast
'Cause he's been breaking the law and he's not going back (going back)
I love him violently all through the night
And yes it's true, I live for you-oo-oo

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause you're my beautiful player
(Sing it to me)
You're my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh, oh, yeah

L is for your love that you gave and took away
O is for the only one I wanted to stay
V is for my valiant Valium baby
E is for the X that we took with champagne

I don't wanna leave, I just wanna breathe
I drive 'em crazy, baby girl, just being me
I'm not selfish, I can't help it
I was playing the cards I was dealt-ed
The name Starz got a lot of love to give
Riding down Broke Dream Boulevard in the Benz
How you love that? I think too much
A thin line between insanity and true love

Hit me and it felt like a kiss
Baby if it don't hurt, then I'll have to insist
We have just one life to live
But true love's more than he can give

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause he's my beautiful player
He's my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah, ah

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause he's my beautiful player
(Sing it to me)
He's my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh, oh, yeah

// Because Of You //

On the streets of LA
Where the future is now
We dance like nobody is watching us
And we live like we want to
But it can also get a little crazy
Unless there's something to hold on to
For me, that was true love

I was a young girl, selfish and wild
Like a fire in L.A
Hot like the summer and mean like a child
Who keeps crying 'til she gets her way
(Like a true star)

Rock and roll on blare and I was in trouble
No one could rock me like you could
I was a bad girl gone good

Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
And it brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you
(You know what I'm talking about)

It was a mad world, we lived for fun
And we got shit for free
Had a face like an angel but inside my heart
Was as black as a broke movie screen
(It was pretty sad)

But then I saw you standing there
Like a millionaire, give me your number
Call me before I get stupid
Make me uncrazy like you did

Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
But you brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you

It isn't hard to see you've got a hold on me
Give me your money, love me to death
Talk like a baby cause I'm so elated
He tell me that I ain't seen nothing quite yet
I don't wanna lose it
I'm in love but I didn't choose it

Roses in my hair, dancing in the air
Feels like I'm flying
Tell me you love me, boy, do it
It's just like I thought, I just knew it

Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
You bring me to my knees
And it's all because of you
Yeah, it's all because of you

// Behind Closed Doors //

I like 'em mad, bad baby, you could be the one
If you wanna get trashed and have fun
Throw me wholly in the sky like a pizza pie (Are you crazy?)
You take my whole world, baby, and twist it to the right
Throw me in the air and whoop like dynamite
Baby you know anytime you can swing by

You know I like 'em bad, boy
Wrong side of the track, boy, oh
You know I like 'em bad boy, like you
(Like you, you know I do)
I like a man with kick, yeah
So come around and hit me up
No other man can lick me like you
(Like you, you know what you do)

Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I'm not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only show a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
(No one can see us)
(I know you like me)

I see my best friends kissing
Touching all the time
But I don't need no jet to write it in the sky
I see it in his eyes, I'm his cherry pie

You know I like 'em bad, boy
They think you make me sad, boy, no
The best I ever had, boy, it's you
(Like you, you know I do)
I want a man that's hot, yeah
To come around and rock me, yeah
No one can dirty talk me
(Like you, you know what you do)

Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I'm not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only shout a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

Everybody's at the park tonight
Everybody's at the shore
Everybody's on the street tonight
What the hell would we do that for?
Everybody's at the park tonight
But we got fireworks galore, behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I'm not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only shout a little but you give me more

// Ben //

Ben's song, another try
Not that you deserve it right now, Ben
No faculties to care and all
But I deserve it, I deserve it, I know
(We can quibble over the history once we make it)
Right?

Lie down, my sad executive love, lie down
Right now, my man, bored out of his head, right now
Fans turn on a May night
Darkness assumes the room
Lie back, he does, in the late night
Hands folded back
Certain of doom
Hold me he sang "Hallelujah"
The midnight's became my noon
You don't know what you do, do ya?
I am on fire for you
I'm on fire, I'm on fire

Lie down, my sad executive love, lie down
Right now, my man, bored out of his head, right now
Fans turn on a May night
Darkness assumes the room
Hold me, hmm
Hold me he say "Hallelujah"
The midnight's became my noon
You don't know what you do, do ya?
I am on fire for you
I'm on fire, I'm on fire

Lie down, my sad executive love, lie down
I can smoke if I want to
I can dance if I want to
Yeah, it's true I want you
But don't say you don't want no harm
If you can't understand
'Cause I won't be here long enough for you to be my man

It's not a very nice ending, but that's what you get, just kidding

God bless America
Land that I love
Stand beside her
And guide her
I don't know anything, hm

There you are

// Bentley //

He drive up in a summer sky, blue Bentley
Death reflecting in his eyes
Thought about all the women who loved me
I said, "Oh no!"
He said, "Get inside"
I said, "Oh no!"
He said, "Get inside"

I got into his summer sky, blue Bentley
Sun reflecting in my eyes
Thought about all the fun I had lately
I said, "Uh huh" I said "I want to drive"
I said, "Uh huh I want, I want to drive"
We drive, we drive

You say you wanna go swimming in my ring
It's green and shimmering
Like my lipstick, the color of dawn
Like my lipstick, the color of dawn
We got out of his summer sky, blue Bentley

Death reflecting in the sky
He held my hand to the ocean he lead me
I said, "Uh huh, I want, I want to die"
"Uh huh, I want, I want to die."

// Big Bad Wolf //

I told you not to go into the woods
I told you that he wasn't any good
I told you not to go into the woods
I told you that he wasn't any good

I'll take the wrong path
I think I've gone a little off track
And now there's no way back
You took all the apples that I had

But I heart you and I wanna be your girl
I heart you and I know you'll rock my world

'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up
(I told you not to go into the woods)

Big, bad, naughty rock star
Your claws are shining bright in the dark
Lifting up my little red skirt
I know you'll leave me here in the dirt

But I heart you, and I wanna be your girl
I heart you, so come back and rock my world

'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up

Life is like, like a little game
That we like to play, just for fun, just for fun
Yeah, we take nothing seriously, nothing's wrong, make me run, all night long
Hide and seek is how you play with me
Oh, you're tempting me, just for fun, just for fun
I hear you calling me over city streets, through the trees, mess with me, then you'll leave
Oh, be still my heart, escaping in your cherry-red car

'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up
'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got

// Big Eyes //

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

I saw you creeping around the garden; what are you hiding?
I beg your pardon, don't tell me "nothing"
I used to think that I could trust you
I was your woman
You were my knight and shining companion

To my surprise
My love's demise
Was his own greed
And lullabies

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

I noticed you got hot in summer
You had no comfort
Your shirt was cotton
Your face was sunburned
You paced around like you'd been waiting
Waiting for something
Your world was burning and I stood watching

As I looked on
The flames grew high
You watched me frown
I said "goodbye"

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

Is it me, was I wrong to have trusted you?
Did I see what I wanted, what wasn't true?
Was I wrong to go on like a little fool?
It's amazing what women in love will do

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

Caught up in a blizzard yesterday
Ought to be alone, or so I say
I needed a change of scenery
She was really starting to annoy me

I went out shopping and planned to go to all them vintage stores
Then I got tired and ended up in some lame department store
And that's okay, cause I found a really cool belt and

I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you

I have a commitment Friday night
First I say my prayer then I'm alright
I sit in my chair, you dim the light
When I look I stare with inner sight

I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you

Met up with some friends for Thai food
I liked it but wasn't in the mood
Can't you see that I'm just feeling blue?
What I do's got nothing to do with you

I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you

Take me for a ride boy, don't leave me on the side boy

I know we fight, we go out every night

// Buddy's Rendezvous //

Everybody's girl
What's the point in
Being everybody's girl?
Maybe you think that way
There's no chance getting hurt
Living for no one cost me way
More than it's worth

So you're gonna be a singer
Well I'll be goddamn
You're as pretty as a postcard
No thank to the old man
It's the same coat I had on
The night that I went in
I can stay an hour at Canter's
The streets cool off by then

When can I see you again?
Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Everything you want
What's the fun in getting
Everything you want?
I wouldn't know but, look
Baby you should try
Forget that lefty shit
Your mom drilled in your mind

Give the world a new savior
Sell his pictures to the press
Buy a place out in the country
Leave this world for
Someone else
My destruction is an hour late
I'm at Buddy's Rendezvous
Telling the losers
And old-timers
How good I did with you
They almost believe me too
Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news
Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Whatever happened
Whatever happened

// Butterflies //

We're sipping cocktails, looking down upon the riot
You whisper "Baby, love the way you look tonight
I wanna save you, save you from the world outside."
I know it seems you're all I wanted and much more
But then, to tell the truth, I've been through this before
They say "I'll save you, save you", but they never do

I think you know I want to believe you
But in my heart, I know that I'll leave you
It's sort of sad how instincts deceive you, or does it please you?
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you've done makes me wanna run, run

I made the decision that I can't be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies
I make the decision that I'm too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it's hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies

Well back in high school, in the yard, we used to fight
But you would sneak in through my window every night
"I wanna take you, take you to the world outside"
Well, I assume it's what I wanted at the time (oh, at the time)
But your eyes were like a constant warning sign (oh, warning sign)
"I wanna take you, take you" and I didn't mind

And even then I didn't believe you (no)
You had a smile so easy to see through
I know a little part of me will always need you (yes)
Try to reach you, try to please you (what?)
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you done makes me wanna run, run

I made the decision that I can't be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies
I make the decision that I'm too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it's hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies

I know, I know, I know, we aren't good together
I can't let go, I'm sure that we should be forever

I look around, there's no one above you
I think you know that I'll always love you
And baby, I'm bad too, it's not just you
But I can't wait forever to trust you
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you've done makes me wanna run, run

I made the decision that I can't be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies
I make the decision that I'm too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it's hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies

// Butterflies (Part 2) //

You're hot for God, but we all got a hunch that
Maybe you've gone astray
Control yourself, but it's so hard
When you can look so good on Sunday
I know he knows that I knew what he's thinking
I know he knows
I know he knows that what he's doing is wrong
But I just tell him, "Go on, sing a sad song."

My baby has an eye for pretty things, pretty things
He thinks that little girls are butterflies and clips their wings
Sicko, psycho, sicko, but he's my beau
Puts them on a roller coaster, lures them in with Coca-Cola!

Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catching butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering high

You're hot to trot, but boy, you got a
Secret that you cannot betray
He likes it hot, you're burning up
But baby boy, your secret is safe
I know he know that I knew what he's thinking
I know he know
I know he know that what he's teaching is wrong
But, honey, this preacher's song has got me too far gone

My baby has an eye for girls who sing, girls who sing
He's lucky I'm the type, that's his thing, that's his thing
Sicko, psycho, sicko, but he's my beau
Dresses up in rings and rollers, poses as a Holy Roller!

Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catching butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering high

His butterflies are in a golden cage, safe and bound
He puts on "Lola" by The Kinks and he dances 'round
And he's so happy that his feet don't even touch the ground
And I'm in love cause I was lost and now I'm finally found

Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catching butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering

Fluttering, fluttering
Fluttering, fluttering
Fluttering
(Psycho, sicko, psycho)

// C U L8R Alligator //

Don't say I'll see you later alligator, so cute
When you know it's not true
I know you're seeing her
But you can still see me, too
If you wanted to, baby

I know they say I'm cheap
And you're two-timing me
That's what you get
We're in the 21st century
So much for chivalry
I know you'll come to me
I have a way with men like you, baby

You're all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic's flawed and you've been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your little baby come, oh, come to you
When you gonna let me drive you crazy like nobody do
You're all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you're scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?

I did the Playboy dip that made us famous
And you was watching there with your crew
I should have known just by the circumstances and who
I was meeting you through
That you were bad news

I know that's not the way
Most people meet but, hey
We're living in the fast lane
Post-modern day
You're not sure you can change
Or get out of the game
You're not the only one
I've heard say, "Maybe."

You're all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic's flawed and you've been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your baby tie you up and drive you crazy?
You're all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you're scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?

// Catch & Release //

So, I heard you wanna go to Rio, baby
Yes, I seen page six lately, ah
I told you both them broads was crazy
Hacking in your phone and shit
Diamonds and pearls, your little girl
She got the best, sparkling like a Hollywood movie, ah-ah-ah

If you got the cash, lock it down tight
I got the looks, you got my heart right
And you love me, 'cause I'm just like neon
Lighting up your night

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothing from you
Just to be like you, my king

I thought that you wanted a real girl, baby
You lured me in with all your gold
Catch and release, and you're so cold
Are you crazy?
You didn't know what kinda fish you caught
'Cause I am a shark, beware of my bark
I'll eat you up like the center of a tootsie pop

'Cause we were a match in heaven, high
Only one catch, Frank was the boss, right?
And it's so sad, 'cause the only way
That you know how to love is fight

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothing from you
Just to be like you, my king

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
You know how I like my world on a string
You know how I like my world on a string

// Caught You Boy //

Everything you do, everything I like
On the radio, dancing in the night
Flowers in my hair, roses on the vine
You can be my guy, and I'm your baby, right?

My, my, apple of my eye
Looking really hot while I make ya cherry pie
Show me what you got, got a sparkle in your eye
You're so high

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

Every way I move, every way you like
Pulling on my dress, holding me too tight
I know we'll probably lose, only got tonight
But I love the way we kiss, love the way we fight

My, my, looking really fly
Like the way the bling on your pinkie ring shine
You spin me really fast and you catch me in the sky
I'm so high

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

I wish I may, I wish I might
Have my one true love tonight
Will you be mine?
Oh hi, looking kinda shy
Cause the way you put your hands on me
Well I, I can barely breathe
Baby boy you make me sigh-igh-igh-igh

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

Thunder in the air, trouble on my mind
Hold me in the dark, kiss it all behind
Baby don't be scared, come on honey, smile
Everything is fine now, everything is fine

My, my, talking all night
Laughing really hard and it makes me wanna cry
I love our playing house, love our dressing-up nights
Drinks on ice

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you, I want you
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
I caught you, I caught you

I caught you boy, I caught you boy
I caught you, I caught you
I caught you boy, I caught you boy
I caught you, I caught you

// Chelsea Hotel No. 2 //

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street
But those were the reasons and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left

Ah, but you got away, didn't you baby?
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, "Well, never mind
We are ugly, but we have the music."

Ah, but you got away, didn't you baby?
You just turned your back on the crowd
And you got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
That's all, I don't even think of you that often

// Children Of The Bad Revolution //

Take me in your fast car, Mercedes
Kissing on your neck while you drive, he, he
Doesn't care, I'm always on my Blackberry
All the time, all the time, buying into every lie

I'm a flashy little lush, but he thinks I'm really fine
Notorious and wild, takes me where I'm gonna shine
Where the bad boys roll hard, dressing like James Dean
And the vixen starlets feels so good to be

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free

Baby, we are chancers on the scene
Glamour in the gutters, only so RT
Sick graffiti artists and tabloid queen
Mix it up, mix it up
Every 'do you've ever seen

We're acting really tough
Like the world belongs to us
Cause it does, yeah, it must
What we do creates the buzz
Where the bad boys blow smoke
Just like they're James Dean
And the it girls blow kisses
Just like Marilyn

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free

Run for our lives
Break outta the chains
So cutting edge
Create our own games
DJs, rock stars, posers we are
The new politicians
The celebrity editions
And it's so pornographic, then it's tragic
Nothing magic makes us free
To be what we wanna be, wanna be

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free
We're gonna get free, oh

We were born to kill, stripped for success
I'm his sweet mess
Do you love me? Yes, yes
Hell yes!

Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
(Going Nero, Nero)
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life
(You're my hero, hero)

Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl

He's the get-rich-quick type
Mafioso-hit type
Girl, I'm gonna marry him
I'm the bad girl next door
Baby's always wanting more
Buying diamond jewelry
Take me to the Jersey Shore

He like my mink white (White)
We go out all night (Night)
We're living off the grid
Shining in the crime light
We were born to kill, best of the best
The new Wild West
Honey, put on that party dress
Hell yes!

Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
(Going Nero, Nero)
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life
(You're my hero, hero)

Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl

Me and my baby planning world domination
Together, taking over our fair nation
'Cause we're born to kill, keeping it fresh
Gold chain, white mesh
Fame is the name of the game
Yes, yes (Yes, yes, yes, yes)

Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
(Going Nero, Nero)
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life

Baby, I'm a four alarm fire

// Daytona Meth //

It's like a Hollywood movie
The black and white waves sparkling truly
My man likes to watch me while I watch TV
While he's t-t-touching me

I remember vintage green wallpaper
Your criminal arms, I couldn't feel safer
King Creole daddy, chasing that paper
I l-l-love you

Baby you'll never be old in my eyes
With your golden grill true love never dies
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride
I will ride
I will ride

Baby you know mama never had much money
But I plan on using this face to pay, honey
Give me give me give me give
You're so funny, love you 'til I die

Who's living life like it's the Belvedere
Swinging all night on the crystal chandelier
Bring that velvet Elvis over here

Come on, baby you never know 'til you try
Baby you never live 'til you die
Baby you never love 'til you're mine
C'mon you're mine, you're mine, you're mine

She is a Spanish seÃ±orita
Her eyes are green and her heart is gold
You have a vision, you'd like to meet her
And so you're walking down that road to the sea

You hear a lot of things about her
Her reputation's widely known
The people talk but that don't matter
Because to you she feels like home
You feel free because

She'll never bring you down
You're hot, then she'll bring you water
She wears a flower crown
She is the people's daughter
She's holy, holy
Maria's prayer, the dragonslayer
She's fighting fire by the sea

She is a Spanish la Lolita
Her eyes are green and her dress is gold
She is a siren, la femme Nikita
Her children young but her soul is old
She feels free

She'll never bring you down
You're tired, she'll bring you water
She'll never leave this town
She is the father's daughter
She's holy, holy
Maria's prayer, the dragonslayer
She's fighting fire by the sea
Maria's prayer, if you should see her
Give her my best wishes for me

Holy, dragonslayer
These troubled waters
They don't mean nothing to you
Patron saint of troubled daughters
Hold your light and you have it true
Because you're holy, you're holy
Holy, holy, you're holy, holy

Mariah's prayer, the dragonslayer
She's fighting fire by the sea
Mariah's prayer, if you should see her
Give her my best wishes for me

I can be your dream girl
I can be your dream girl

When you wake up to the day
And see the city, dark and gray
You can already see the curtain coming down
Sitting, open up your files
Right click JARs to see her smile
Transfer to your heart, and let the world go 'round
Shoo-wop shoo, baby

I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
When it all gets too much
Darling, I'm soft to the touch
Hush, hush and stop your rushing
I can be your dream girl, baby

iPhone ringing, boss is screaming
On the TV, news streaming
It means nothing to you though, you tune it out
Close your eyes and change the station
Switch the pictures on your wavelength
Put me on your playlist, I'm your favorite song
Shoo-wop shoo, baby

I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
When it all gets too much
Darling, I'm soft to the touch
Hush, hush and stop your rushing
I can be your dream girl, baby

Candlelight burns twice as bright, baby burns half as long
So keep your fire burning, so you always love me strong
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Whoa-whoa
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Whoa, baby
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Whoa-whoa
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Whoa, baby

Now it's night time, driving uptown
City's sparkling, but you shut down
So you signal right and turn your engine off
Cars fly by you, stars beside you
Turn that radio inside you
Tune the station that's playing the one you love
Shoo-wop shoo, baby

I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl

Hush, hush and stop your rushing

// Drive //

I've been out on that open road
You can be my full-time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
You can be my full-time baby, hot or cold

Don't break me down (Me down, me down)
I've been traveling too long (Too long, too long)
I've been trying too hard
With one pretty song (Hmm-hmm)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just drive, just drive
Just drive, just drive

Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it
Light 'til dark

Don't leave me now (Me now, me now)
Don't say goodbye (Goodbye, goodbye)
Don't turn around
Leave me high and dry (Hmm-hmm)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just drive, just drive
Just drive, just drive

You think I'll ever feel different than I do now?
You think I'll ever feel any magic again
You think I'll ever transform into the man
God meant to make when he began?

Hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just drive, just drive
Just drive, just drive

// Driving In Cars With Boys //

They say I'm wasting time, they say that I'm no good
Summer of my life, not doing what I should
Call me poison ivy 'cause I'm far from good
But pretty from afar, like a dark star

They think I'm dangerous, they think I'm really bad
I'm just making up for what I never had
Go out every night whenever I feel sad
All this drive-by love got me crazy like a drug

I wear my red lipstick, got my make-up on
Stumble into trouble, siren with a sad song
They all got girlfriends but I'm the one that they want
Miss America with the blue mascara on

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know

Mommy's Mercedes or Billy's pick-up truck
Come home late at night and baby picks me up
Tell him just drive on and d-don't ever stop
Don't take me home again, take me to a new land

I wear my red lipstick, grab my coat and gun
Wonder if this is it, it's darkest before dawn
Sometimes I wanna give in but I just have to go on
Miss America now I'm gone, baby, gone

Leave a beautiful corpse, live my life on the run
I got my cash and my Louis Vuitton, diamonds and guns
Girls just wanna, just wanna have fun

You can say what you really think
Just say goodbye to the sweet Pacific
Goodbye to your lonely queen

Earthquakes happen naturally down in California
Walls shake, but I don't give a shit, 'cuz dying's better for ya
Fuck life, everything here sucks, there's no music anymore, yeah
I pray that he takes me in
The next big 9.4, yeah

I don't know what's overcome me
Just say you're my baby, but
I'm feeling tired and I think I'm done, yeah

Goodbye to your lonely queen

// Elvis (Demo) //

Platinum and vale acrylics
Skim the paper for the critics
Baby's breathing Elvis lyrics
On the copper bar
Late in motel lounges singing
Spotlight on the band is swinging
Chateau Marmont memories fading
Hope is very far

Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my Chantilly lace catching
Baby, on the chandelier

Sweeping scents and blue hydrangea
Summer hail and summer stranger
Baby, he's in constant danger
Help is very far
You look like a Florida native
"Are you?" I said, at the rate of
Slow molasses from the state of
Vermont with a Southern drawl

Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my Chantilly lace is catching
On the chandelier

He said he'd come to welcome, warn me
Just your diamond to adorn me
Come to be and see the one and only
For my final year
Well, thank you

Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my Chantilly lace is catching
On the chandelier
It's catching on that chandelier
It's catching on that chandelier
Where are you when I need you most?

// End Of The World //

Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
Cause you don't love me any more

Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand, no, I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye

// Every Man Gets His Wish //

You can whistle for it

Baby, you'll never grow old in my eyes
With your golden grill, true love never dies
You wanna watch me while I watch TV
While you're t-t-t-t-touching me
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride

We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in that Chevrolet from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Every man deserves to see the sunrise

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

You said I'd never make it out outta here alive
At the rate I was going, I'd be lucky to die
I was born so bad, not naturally right
The brightest star on Hollywood and Vine

We're gonna party like we're running outta time
We're getting drunk and driving fast on cherry wine
Never do belong to anyone I find
Leaving everything I ever knew behind

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Promised me this
Well, you lied

I learned how to make love from the movies
He found me waitressing at Ruby Tuesday's
He said I wanna buy you a classic white milkshake
I said I'll serve you up a special side of heartbreak
Special side of heartbreak
I was working down in the corner cafe
You drove by in a Chevrolet
Whistle at me as my hips go sway
Lana Del Rey, how you get that way?
How you get that way?
I said, "He loves my heart shaped sunglasses
He loves the heart shape my ass is
Cristal, crystal champagne glasses."

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Promised me this
Well, you lied

// Fake Diamond //

You're like a fake diamond
Sparkling when the lights are on
But when the nighttime comes
And all the lights go off
You turn off with them
(Where do you go when the lights turn low boy?)
You're like an old film reel
Kissing me when the crowd can watch
But when the velvet falls
And the projector coughs
I can be sure you're gone
(You say it's not true but I know how you do, boy)

I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

You're like a fake diamond
Sparkling in the moon and sun
You shine like the only one
But when the darkness comes
Baby, you're on the run
(Where do you go when the lights turn low boy?)
You're like my ex-boyfriend
Kissing me when the camera's on
I'm candy for your arm
Look like a debutante
But I'm not what you want
(You say it's not true but I know how you do, boy)

I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

Baby I can hold you tight
Let me love you right
In the middle of the night
I don't wanna fight
Give it to me
Sing it to me
Show me the light
(You say it's not true, but I know how you do, boy)

I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

// Find My Own Way //

Snow is coming down like rain
I'm at it myself again
A little tired, even more confused
Come on, baby, don't be shy
You can say what make you high
I see the way you be lying, be abused

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
I don't care what you think

Breathing getting fast again
Now I'll start my worrying
When will I learn that there ain't nothing I can do?

Jesus was a dying man
If he can't do it, no one can
When will you learn that we ain't nothing without you?

We don't need anybody when we're down
We don't really find it hard to get around
We'll find our own way back to town
And oh, don't you tell us how we need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
We don't, we don't care what you think

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody but me
And I don't care what you think

// Fine China //

I wore diamonds for the birth of your baby
For the birth of your son
On the same day, my husband-to-be
Packed his things to run
Was bittersweet to say the least
One life begins, one comes undone
I've always been a strong woman of faith
Strong like a tree, but the unlucky one

I'm going down now
With all of my

Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough, but it wasn't
The Earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire, but we were wooden

I wore diamonds for the day of our wedding
For our day in the sun
On the same day, my mother-to-be said she wouldn't come
It's always been that way with me
No time for change, no time for fun
It's always been that way, it seems
One love begins, one comes undone

I'm going down now
With all of my

Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough, but it wasn't
The Earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire, but we were wooden

All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
Blue, ah, blue
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
Blue, ah

Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough, but it wasn't
The Earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire, but we were wooden

Fine china, fine china, fine china
Fresh linen, fresh linen, fresh linen

// For You //

All these feelings I'm tired of them
Ruling over my life again
Emotions aren't my friend
I keep them ordered as best I can

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Layman, workman, his man, her man
How about about the weather?

All these people I'm tired of them
Sifting into my life again
Their questions, the "how and when"
I try and answer the best that I can but

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Layman, workman, his man, her man
How about about the weather?

All my worries, they come and go
They tend to leave when I let you know
On bad days I take it slow
I try to dance when I hit a low

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
It will all get better

Oh, the days they go so fast
I can't believe what is in my past
The future's here at last
I don't need to have what she has

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
It will all get better

Sing it out, sing it loud
Sing it out, sing it loud
Be proud, come out
Be proud, come out

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
We can make it better, yeah
We will have it better

// Fordham Road //

30 blocks to Fordham Road
That's a bad neighborhood
Crack house on the corner
I know I shouldn't do what it is I could

The stone Mary in the garden
She let me know she watching
She said I better get walking
I better walk away

I don't know why it is that I wanna stay
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away

I catch a dollar in the wind and I
Buy a cup of coffee
There's a place on Valentine
That still charge ninety cents
I keep on walking in the daytime
And in my eyes, it's always nighttime
And I like it when it's me at night
'Cause that's when all the stars come out
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh

I don't know why it is that I wanna stay
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away

It's the greatest, it's the greatest day
It's the greatest, it's the greatest day, oh

I'm not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away

// Freak Like Me //

Flames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes, like an endless summer
That's the way I feel for you
If time stood still, I'd take this moment, make it last forever

Your halo's full of fire
I'm rising up, rising up
My hot love's full of fire
Love's full of fire
La, ah

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Leather black and eyes of blue
Sun reflecting in your eyes, like an easy rider
Life makes sense when I'm with you
Looking back, my past
It all seems stranger than a stranger

So let's dance in slow motion
Tear it up, tear it up
Let's dance by the ocean
Ah, ah

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Marry me, marry me
Take a long vacation
Money and power and dresses, big standing ovation
Loving you can't be wrong
There's no complications, no

Marry me, marry me
Use all your relations
Carry me, carry me
Fuck our generation
Loving you can't be wrong
Love is our salvation now

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Hit the streets, city beat
I know what you want
Talk to me softly
French restaurant
Every time I turn around
I look at you like we're now
I'm telling you, it's all true

I'm talking to him while I'm thinking of you
I'm trying my best, I don't know what to do
Talking to you, don't know what it's about

I know they think that I had everything
If I can't have you, then they can't have me
(I know it looks like I have everything)
If I can't have you, then they can't have me
(I know they think that I had everything)
Why am I crying on the balcony?

If I can't have you, then they can't have me
(Honestly)

Super cool, swimming pool
Would you paint me sweet?
Look at you, playing cool
In the color of it all
Every time I turn around
I look at you like we're now
Can't one single thing
Be just what it appears to be?

I'm talking to him while I'm thinking of you
I'm trying my best, I don't know what to do
Talking to him, I don't know what it's about

Back the way it was, a summer of love

I been drinking Jack and Coke a lot
Sucking on my lollipops
Listening to my hard rock mu-mu-mu-music
Thinking 'bout you quite a lot
Smoking all my cigarettes
Missing what we used to got
You-you-you-you kid

Won't you come home to me now, babe?
I've been holding it down, but I'm losing my ground
Won't you come home to me now, babe?
I'm a strong babydoll but I want you around

// Go Go Dancer //

I drop it like it's hot on the pole, on the pole
Shining in the club, neon gold, neon gold
They call me "Firecracker" and alcohol's a factor
I drop it like it's hot, baby bold, baby bold
A little bit of fun for your soul, for your soul
They call me "Firecracker", 'cause ain't nobody faster

In my white go-go boots and my silver design?
I know it makes you wild

// Golden Grill //

What happened to 'nobody does it better'?
See ya walking 'round like you were born to kill
Driving in your Escalade flash that golden grill
You're picking up a bad habit you get the ones that no one will
Where did your love go babe before you turned criminal?

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

So here we are, there we go and that's the way
That you gonna roll, that you gonna fight, gonna play
It doesn't really matter to me that you find your way
You've been gone for so long that you're a shell of yourself babe

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

The sun once shined for you
I've changed my mind for you
Your golden day has turned to night
Your golden day has been denied

There's no more chances for you now, you never learn
You lit my fire baby, but I just got burned

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happen to no one does it better than you babe
You babe

// Goodbye Kiss //

Doomed from the start
We met with a goodbye kiss, I broke my wrist
It all kicked off, I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind 'cause love's hard to find

Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs

Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words, can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and Roll, sent us insane
I hope someday that we will meet again

Running wild
Giving it everyone, now that's all done

Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs

Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words, can save us, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and Roll, sent us insane
I hope someday that we will meet again

You go your way and I'll go my way
No words can save us, this lifestyle made us
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and Roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again

// Greenwich //

Hey, back in, ah
Baby, come on

Are you back in Greenwich, dropping acid?
Are you at the Archive, watching television?
Did you leave for Battery with your weed?
And your leather, looking like Ray Gillen?
Are you still the king of rock 'n' roll, babe?
Bet you miss hearing me sing, calling me Lana
And did you take your run today
Along that West Side Highway?
Do you miss your baby mama?
Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never come back to me?

Does it feel like yesterday to you, yet?
How quickly you forget how I made you smile
I remember everything
The diamond horseshoe, wedding ring, and the tiara
Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never return to me?

// Hangin' Around //

You'll see me hanging around on the edges of town
I could be bad for you
And honey don't think about chasing this girl around
I could be bad for you

And anywhere you go, I will follow
Even if it's only in spirit, baby
But honey you should go by tomorrow
I predict that shit's gonna get real crazy

Leave while you still can
Before I take you down, take you down
Boy there's still a chance
For you to get out now, get out now

You'll see me hanging around on the edges of town
I could be bad for you

// Hawaiian Tropic //

Hawaiian tropic, dark, and a bottle of jack in the Cadillac
As I drive down the highway
You aren't coming back and I know that now
So I let the wind hit me in my face

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish

Your red Hawaiian shirt and your hair jet black
Hanging 'round with your friends by the track
Baby, you can't come back from being that bad
Just to sit at home, pledge allegiance to the flag

Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone

Copacabana, yes in my party dress
I'm shimmering in love on that crystal meth
A Coca Cola kid, roller coaster child
You my everything, give me that baby doll smile

Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, where is mine?
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, were you lying?

And the velvet Elvis and the rosaries
And your white Corvette under willow trees
You the one for me, my one true king

Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone

I remember party dresses
I remember party dresses

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
But sometimes it comes too late

// Heavy Hitter //

I was lounging at the Chateau Marmont
Glimmering by the swimming pool
My man walked in like a slow-motion movie
I said, "You're so cool."

I heard a man screaming, "Lights, camera, action!"
I c-c-can't remember what happened
I overdose, you throw me over your shoulder
I was dying, you were screaming
"Open up that Lamborghini."

Open up your butterfly doors

You're the king mafia baby
I'm the Queen of Alchemy
I know a way to make gold
By mixing our souls to escape reality

Me and Monterrey went to that ocean
I got that magical trance potion
Gotta leave, I can't wait 'til I'm older
You was laughing, I was running
Use that remote to open up

// Hey Blue Baby //

Hey blue baby
Put that Hank Williams on
It's your little blue baby
Calling for her favorite song
Get out that whiskey
Pour it right quickly
Put them hallway lights on
I hope one day you can remember
Our love before it all went wrong

But the only stars we saw were in the sky
Not the boulevard
And the only thing we wanted was to be free
And the only girl you had eyes for played downtown
At the local bar
That was me
She was me

Hey blue baby
Get that old pickup going
Turn it once, twice, three times
If you love me, oh
Get out that dirt bike
Get on that turnpike
Do what you have to do
Just know your baby's back here waiting
Just know she thinks you're really cool

And the only stars we saw were in the sky
Not the boulevard
And the only thing we need is to be free
And the only girl you have eyes for plays downtown
At the local bar
That was me
She was me

I tell you all the time, get yourself in line
Tired of waiting, tired of crying
I tell you all the time, get yourself in line
Tired of yelling, tired of hollering
You're making me blue, you're making me blue
Making me blue, just do what you do

And the only stars we need were in the sky
Not the boulevard
And the only thing we want is to be free
And the only girl that you love still
Plays downtown at the local bar
Yeah she's me
Yeah she's me

// Hey You //

Do, do
Ah, ah
I said

Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me

He's a walk with the past
Love of the fast
Girls in the fast lane
His knuckles are brass
A heart like a horse
Love of the games, gold in his veins

Met him at the club
Singing my songs
He says, "Are you famous?"
I was once
A b-movie actress
Has been, but never was
He knows that it's love

He saw me on stage
Pointed my way
The look of desire, all on his face
I gave him the eye
And took my place
I could tell that he'd be mine by daytime

Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me

He's a man with a cast
Cane and a glass
Rim full of champagne, looking for class
A mind like a steel cage
Soul full of rage
Tactical nature so they call him insane

Met him at the club
And from that night on
He called me his princess, right on!
I'm his little ex-beauty queen
Never going back to where I've been

Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me

No one can save me
Oh, do, do, woah
When did I ever care
What they said about our love, my baby
My baby boo

Yo, our friends think it's sad
Living so bad
I'm always crying
He's always mad
Our life is a mess
Oh it's a shame
"What did they see in each other?" they say

I met him at the club
And from that night on
Called me his princess, right on!
I'm his little ex-beauty queen
Never going back to where I've been

Hey you, what you doing?

// Hollywood //

One day, my hoops will be made of diamonds
My knuckles made of real gold
I'll spend my days getting high with all my friends
In the glamorous and green old part of Hollywood

Sun will rise, I'm a supernova
Body electric and I dance like Morrison
When the night begins, baby comes alive again

In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
I'm alive again
I'm alive again

One day, I'll drive in a gold Mercedes Benz
Singing opera on Bel Air Road
Hair to my ass will be flying in the wind
Shooting heroin and speedballs

See the sea, I'm a supernova
I walk on water and I dance like Joplin
When the sun descends, I dive into the waves again

In Hollywood
In Hollywood

Oh-oh, oh-oh, c-can you see me?
Whoa-oh, my heart beating fast

I was built to last
Whoa-oh, c-can you feel that?
Ah-ah, ah-ah, my heart shaking fast
I can feel that you're the one for me
You'll be my first, and you'll be my last

// Hollywood's Dead //

Our kind of love
It was once in a lifetime
It couldn't last
It was doomed from the first time
And you
Were '50s cool
In blue suede shoes
But it was a cover for all of the trouble
You got into

I always fall for the wrong guy
Things that are bad always taste nice
That's what girls like me do, lose you

Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Vicious in flames
Roland is dying
And in the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful

This kind of life
Wasn't meant for the good girl
Try as I might
In the end, it's a cruel world
And you
Are living proof
Sinatra aloof
But you were an actor who only went after
The ones who swooned

I always fall for the same type
Gangsters in Vegas on game night
That's what girls like me like, the limelight

Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Marilyn's sad
Hendrix is lying there
In the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful

If you should go before me, then know
That I always loved you
There's no one above you, babe

Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Lennon, wake up
Cobain, stop lying there
In the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodnight, you're so beautiful

I have to be your girl
I gotta be your girl

You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

You shot, shot, shot, shot, shot
An arrow through my heart now I want you a lot

Just for fun, just for fun
'Cause we take nothing seriously
Nothings wrong, nothings wrong, oh

'Cause we love to play
Just for fun, in the sun
Yeah we know nothing means a thing cause
We have won, boy we won, won, won, won, won, won, won

I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

I had bright wishes in the summer, I was bathing in sunlight
Painting in the garden like a ghost in mid-July
Running fast from something with my eyes wide like
Saucers spinning in the sun

I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine

I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

Your lies were hot kisses in the summer
I was dreaming of a lake
Dreaming of the water where I'd rise like a phoenix
Or an iron from the fire
I've got things to tell you like I know that you're a liar

I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine

I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

Your words cut like a knife in butter
I was fighting for my art
Fighting with my lover, you had me so tied up
Thinking there's no other
Yeah, right
Yeah, right

You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly

In his soft leather and his blue jeans

He got a way, oh, baby, he got a way, oh, baby
He got a way with his words
They be like diamonds and pearls
They be like diamonds and pearls
He gives to his little favorite girls

I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby, tonight

Stands real quiet in the moonlight

So slow like a two-step, you hold me real tight

All my friends say my lifeâs
Like a bad country song
I just smile, say "I know, but I like to sing along"
For the sweet wedding days
I just put Hank Williams on
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want

They think I'm crazy but I keep laughing
They think I'm funny for wearing a smile
But itâs just in my nature and it's just how you move me
Real slow like a movie and I wanna rewind

All my friends say my life's
Like a bad country song
I just smile, say "I know, but I like to sing along"
For the sweet wedding days
I just put Hank Williams on
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want

Ah, la, la
Ah, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want

// I Still Love Him //

And I remember when I met him, it was so clear that
He was the only one for me
We both knew it, right away
And as the years went on, things got more difficult -
We were faced with more challenges
I begged him to stay
Try to remember what we had at the beginning

He was charismatic, magnetic, electric and everybody knew it
When he walked in every woman's head turned, everyone stood up to talk to him
He was like this hybrid, this mix of a man who couldn't contain himself
I always got the sense that he became torn between being a good person and missing out on all of the opportunities that life could offer a man as magnificent as him

And in that way I understood him
And I loved him
I loved him, I loved him, I loved him
And I still love him
I love him

// I Talk To Jesus //

One, two
One, two

I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
What the fuck happened here?
I guess what they meant when
They paid the price
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
Where are the trailer parks?
And where all the Christmas lights?

I had a boyfriend
He came from this town
We used to pretend we were married and start again
He read the Bible
Showed me what Jesus said
He said I should rewrite (He only read the red)

I want Jesus to take me out this life, baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
Nothing looks familiar here
No one even that I like
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
I was so much happier when I was gonna be your wife

We had a deal and
I fucked it up when
I made the decision to become someone
We had the one thing that no one ever had
True love
It's true love

I ask Jesus to take me out this life baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

I never meant to hurt you baby
It's so hard to be true
In this world where everything's so black and blue
I never meant to hurt you darling
It's so hard to be good
In this world where you do what you know you shouldn't

I want Jesus to take me out this life baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

// I Want It All //

Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?

I'm the national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on", he said "Yes, yes, yes..."
(Of course we can, my darling)

And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact kiss, kiss

I sing the national anthem
While I'm standing over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron
He says to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real
Don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
(Yes, of course I will my darling)

And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel

Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

I'm the national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of sweetness and danger
Queen of Saigon
He says to be cool and I know he means it
He's loving my look
And I'm loving all his strategic ways
I said "do you think you'll kill for me one day?"
(Yes, of course I will, my darling)

And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on his stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
I'm your national anthem, national anthem
I'm your national anthem, national anthem

// I Was In A Bad Way //

Wait, wait, for me
Wait, wait, wait, for me
Come on, baby

I was in a bad way, honey
'Til I met you
I was in a bad place, honey
I need you

I was going nowhere fast, you were bringing me down
I wanted to go, you were the cutest guy in town

Wait, wait, wait, for me
I don't wanna go
Wait for me
I wanna go, I wanna go
Wait for me
I wanna go

I was in a bad way, honey
I was in a bad way, I was in a bad way

Bring it on punk, you know that I want it
I'm not a bad girl but when I go to clubs, I want to flaunt it
I feel like, you're Superman, and I'm not
It's on your terms, we can waste all my time
Because I want you, I want to go with you
Don't leave me here, I want to go with you

Can I be your baby doll, my my
Can I be your cherry pie
Why do all the best girls like bad guys
Cause they're to die for

I know what they say about you, you know that I never care
You were always my type with your dark heart and your long, black hair, yeah
Baby, I wanna take you higher, higher
So let me, so let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me love you
Let me love you, let me love you

I don't wanna go
Take me with you
I don't wanna go away, no
Take me with you

I need you, I want you, you know that

// If I Die Young //

All the roses are red and Jupiter, too
I'm lying in my nightgown making confessions to you
It's all over now, baby blue
All my secrets are out
I told them all to you

And it's a little grim
But I sing a hymn only for you
I seal it with a kiss
And it goes like this
"Baby, love me too"

If I die young, let me die in California
And when I'm gone, let 'em play my favorite song
It's Jimmy Buffet
To remember life's a beach, baby, enjoy it
When I'm done, let the music play on
And on and on and on
Go on and on and on

All my stories are out
All the lies are out, too
When we drive in the nighttime
I lift them up to you

And it's a little grim
But I sing a hymn only for you
I seal it with a kiss
And it goes like this
"Baby, love me, too"

If I die young, let me die in California
And when I'm gone, make 'em play my favorite song
It's Jimmy Buffet
To remember life's a beach, baby, enjoy it
When I'm done, let the music play on
And on and on and on
Go on and on and on

Be my baby (Ohh)
Be my baby, tonight
We'll go on and on and on
Be my baby (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Be my baby, tonight
Go on and on and on

It's a little grim
But I sing a hymn only for you
I seal it with a kiss
And it goes like this

We'll go on and on and on
Be my baby (Mmm)
Be my baby, tonight
Go on and on and on

// In The Sun //

Everybody said that it wasn't love
I was dumb
I was getting high on your sugar rush
For too long
You told me that we could have it all
Now you're posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, what the hell?
We were in heaven then we fell
I believed you, said I'd never leave you
I-

I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Living with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you're posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun

Everybody said, "Careful of that guy"
Baby couldn't stop, it was suicide
Headed for a cliff, eyes open wide
You were feigning love by holding tight
But I need you, don't want to, but need to
I-

I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Living with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you're posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun

You been messing around with my beating heart
You should be ashamed
Boy, you never loved me from the start
Such a wicked game
I told you I needed somebody
I never used you for love or for money, boy
I feel like I can't trust nobody
Beat on my heart and you left it all bloody, now

I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Living with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you're posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun

// In Wendy //

Well, dark clouds they'll subside for awhile
And sit down, I can make my friends smile
I have lost a lot but I'm sane, you know
And I'm calling you up just to say hello, so
Hi, my lovely, hi, my lovely
I am someone else

I did think I would live life alone
I was sure I was made out of stone
I have lost a lot but you helped me find
What was really real and some peace of mind
And I'm awfully thankful and I am so grateful
I need no one else

Will you think of me when I am gone?
Will you comfort me when I am wrong?
I have a lost a lot but I'm feeling fine 'cause I
Finally found out nothing's mine and I'm
Only human, I'm so human
I am nothing else

// Is It Wrong? //

I guess it's symptomatic of a slight infatuation
Stalking you has sorta become like my occupation
Used to be a beauty queen with simple acquisitions
Met my local rock star now I'm having visions

I fell for you, you like me too
Let's get it on, check one, two
I fell for you, you want me too
Let's get it on

Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
I'm making out with you while you're singing your song
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
You're playing your guitar and it's turning me on
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walking around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your car like a star
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it's wrong, I don't wanna be right

I get so systematic in this kind of situation
I need it, have to have it, t-take over, domination
Used to be so simple, never wanting, never wishing
Now I'm hooked on fame and I'm a girl on a mission

I fall for you, it's all for you
Let's get it on, check one, two
I fall for you, it's all for you
Let's get it on

Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
I'm making out with you while you're singing your song

You're playing your guitar and it's turning me on
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walking around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your car like a star
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it's wrong, I don't wanna be right

A funny little thing about love is that you're blind all the time
And even when you think you had enough
You're wanting more, it isn't right but
You can't stop

You got your eyeliner, long hair, walking around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your ca-ca-ca-car-r-r
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walking around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your ca-ca-ca-car-r-r
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it's wrong I don't wanna be right

You smell like a million roses
Bathed in rock 'n' roll
Ours was the greatest
Love story ever told
Throat like an angel with a voice that was made of gold
That's my baby

He was the king of the town
With a crown that would never fall
A heart that would beat
Like a bass for his baby doll
One in a million, inimitable soul
That's my baby

Young or old, summer or cold
Young or old, summer or cold

You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy

You never cared what I did at all
Motel singer or the silver pole

Femme fatale, always on the run
Diamonds on my wrist
Whiskey on my tongue
Before I get bad, I gotta get drunk
So get over here
Pour me a cold one

Babe, you can see that I'm danger
Teetering off of the stage, yeah
Sparkling in sequins, say, hey-yeah
Time to give in to the kindness of strangers

So tell me you're mine
Let's get it on

He don't like no spotlight
He the kinda man, stand real quiet
He don't wanna go, go home
He don't wanna go, go home

He's a sweet baby, but he looks mean
In his soft leather, and his blue jeans
He don't wanna go, go
He don't wanna go, go, go

You are just an American boy, you got your youth and you got your dreams
You ride your Harley like there's nothing to lose, you got the wind, but you're not free

And you don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
We don't wanna go, go home

He don't like no small things
He be riding round on some tall dreams
He don't wanna go, go home
He don't wanna go, go home

Hollywood sun, small town things
Probably he's changed, that's why he drinks
He don't wanna go, go home
He don't wanna go, go home

He was just an American kid, liked rock and roll and wanted to have fun
He felt the same way all of us did like probably he was the only one

And you don't wanna go, go home
I won't wanna go, go home
We won't wanna go, go home

I was just an American girl, I was reaching for the sun
I never really had big dreams when I saw you, were my only one
And I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home

// Last Girl On Earth //

Baby has a broken heart
She can't belong to only one
Until another girl is found
I don't pay for anything
My cigarettes or diamonds rings
My feet don't even touch the ground

Chariots of gold, I ride with Jay-Z, Jared Leto
I'm a superpower, now they call me the tornado
I got roses in my hair, I belly dance, and do the tango
Sometimes I get lonely, everybody told me no

No one lives forever, but that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on

Cleopatra used to rule
But she got nothing on me now
'Cause I'm the last girl on earth
I turn the television on
They only play my favorite song
Since I'm the last girl on Earth

Chariots of gold, I'm sitting, sipping cherry cola
Caesar said he'd fall in love with me if I was older
I own all of Mexico and I got my own roller-coaster
Sometimes I get lonely, millions can hold me now

No one lives forever, but that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on

I stay up late at night, try not to think about it
Pretend I'm happy, ruling all the world without love
I get so tired being on display somehow
Sometimes I get lonely, but millions all know me now

No one lives forever, but that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
There's no such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on

// Let My Hair Down //

You make me wanna let my hair down, man

You make me wanna let my hair down

You get me moving like no one can
Get me moving like no one can
You get me moving like no one can

// Life Is Beautiful //

Don't be that way
Don't you pretend
You're not awake
When you know you are
I see the way
You're lying there
I know you can't
Be very far

God wouldn't do that
He knows how I feel
I can't go through that
And so it's not real

Life is still so beautiful
Life is still so beautiful

Don't be so still
You never are
You like to play
Your soul's on fire
I don't believe this is the end
And I still feel your heart's desire

God couldn't do that
He knows you belong
To me and me only
And so I'll be strong

Life is still so beautiful
Life is still so beautiful

Come on, boy, let's go
We can hit the road
We don't have to say
Where we're going
We can go anywhere
We can go anywhere
We can go anywhere
Right now

Life is still so beautiful
Life is still so beautiful

// Lift Your Eyes //

You should have let me know
That I had no chance at all
I can never be what you wanted
Should have let me know
That you're still thinking about her
Should've told me you was on it

Sometimes I wonder why
Why I even bother
Trying to pull you out, boy
Should have let me know
I would lose you to the drink

Lift your eyes, lift your eyes
Just a little higher, just a little higher
Lift those eyes, look into mine
Cause I can guide ya, I can guide ya
Lift those eyes, lift your eyes
I know that you're scared to death
Running out of breath
But I can hold you, hold you

You should have let me know
That you worked around the clock
Could have tried a little harder, yeah
You should have let me know
That you were afraid to love me
Afraid of looking like a liar

Sometimes I wonder why
Why I even ask you, but I do

Lift your eyes, lift your eyes
Just a little higher, just a little higher
Lift those eyes, look into mine
Cause I can guide you, I can guide you
Lift those eyes, lift your eyes
I know that you're scared to death
Running out of breath
But I can hold you, hold you

// Looking For America //

Took a trip to San Francisco
All our friends said we would jive
Didn't work, so I left for Fresno
It was quite a scenic drive
Pulled over to watch the children in the park
We used to only worry for them after dark

I'm still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind

I flew back to New York City
Missed that Hudson River line
Took a train up to Lake Placid
That's another place and time, where
I used to go to drive-ins and listen to the blues
So many things that I think twice about before I do now

I'm still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind

It's just a dream I had in mind

// Lust For Life (BloodPop® Remix) //

There's nobody here, just us together
Keeping it hot like July forever

'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
There's no way for us to come, wait
'Cause boy we're gold, boy we're gold
And I was like

Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all of your clothes

They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight, yeah

And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)
And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)

'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
So there's no need for us to hesitate
We're all alone, let's take control
And I was like

Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all of your clothes

They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight, yeah

And a lust for life
And a lust for life

We dance on the H of the Hollywood sign
'Til we run out of breath, gotta dance 'til we die
My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever
There's no more night, blue skies forever

And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)
And a lust for life (and a lust for life)

To make a connection
Is it working or not?

But it's funny how some things just change in a day, or even in an hour
I'm like a wild caged animal, lying by the swimming pool, losing all my power
It's funny how my life just stopped and shifted from meeting you as a stranger
Now I'm like a wild caged animal, lying by the swimming pool, trying to avoid danger

But my lust for life

// Maha Maha //

Every time that you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
He's someone I have never talked about
'Cause I know that we'd both be dead if you found out

Every time you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something I have been withholding
I'm not like every other girl

Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for

So if you begin to think
That my light might be supernatural
I'd have to say "You're right, you're right, mon cher, it is"
I come from a place that your mind cannot even imagine
Where we sing "Maha, maha, maha, maha"

Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for

Maha, oh Maha
Oh Maha, Maha
I give my loving, I'm your devoted
I'll give my love, babe
I'm your devoted

Maha, Maha, Maha, Maha
Maha, Maha, Maha

// Making Out //

Hiya honey
What ya doing?
I been hula-hooping waiting for you, aah
Whoa haters, fakers, mass-manipulators
Don't know what you're trying to prove
I'm the New York City queen queen
You should hear me sing sing
Baby I'm the real thing, check one two
Stop looking at my train-wreck life and start
Listening to the way I sing the blues

You know, I know what they say about me
I know that they think I'm danger
So what if it makes me happy, happy, happy?

It doesn't really matter what you say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Baby you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot

"Hiya honey
How's it going?
Saw you skipping up on TV looking blue aah
You're shaking, making music and you're famous
Deep down you're the same girl I knew"

She said, I know what they say about you
I know that they think you're crazy
I know that they are mistaken, baby, baby

It doesn't really matter what they say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Baby you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot

Singing for the gangsters
Chasing all that paper
Living life so dangerously
And there's nothing for my anger
Money is my savior
I can be whatever I think
It's like heaven, heaven
Living on the edge never knowing where I'm going to be
And I am dreading, never settling down
That's when dying is beginning to please

It doesn't really matter what you say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Honey you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot

// Match Made In Heaven //

(Sing that shit, girl)

It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

You give me butterflies, heart skipping one, two

I want it bad, bad, I want it bad

I know you're sick, boy, I wanna get the flu
I'm running temperatures thinking of your love, boo

If they're gonna talk, let 'em

You're such a bad boy, I heard about you
And so has every other girl, that's why they want you
My local rock star, the Willie B. crew
You out there on the grind
Now come home to your queen, boo

I, I, I, gotta get it started
I want it bad, bad, I want it bad

You're number one, boy, no one else will do
I'm like a prize fighter, clocking chicks to get to you
This race I run for you, won't stop until I'm through
I'm out there doing shit that I should never ever do

I, I, I, gotta get it started
I want it bad, bad, I want it bad

Sweet neighborhood

It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Down on your knees, begging me, please
I am your queen, oh-ah

Don't wanna trip but I could fall for you
Heaven is a place called earth on your arm, ooh

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

// Meet Me In The Pale Moonlight //

Understand this, I'm not looking for true love tonight
If you wanna be my little baby
You can meet me in the pale moonlight
I been working every day 8 to 9 and
Serving coke and fries at the movie blue drive-in
If you want me, you know where to find me

I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby

Understand this, I been liking you since I was small
I don't wanna get you running scared
When there's no pressure there at all
I been working 8 to 9 every day
And think about you almost all the time, all the time and
If I wanna see you, I drive by

I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby

I'm the sweetest girl in town so why are you so mean?
When you gonna ditch that stupid .... you got?
It's me you should be seeing

Hello-o-o you are looking so fine, so fine
Fantasy about you's like a gold mine, gold mine
Asking everybody, "Is he mine? Is he mine?"
Not quite yet, but I'm gonna get-get him
Not quite yet, but I'm gonna get-get him!

I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby

// Melancholia //

If it was the New York Times, they'll say that I'm dead
And if it's Rolling Stone, they'll say I'm uninviting
I don't really give a fuck, it's no surprise
I never had friends here either
Still I'm on a run with the light in my eyes
And if you did it wouldn't happen either

Sometimes bad things happen to good people
And sometimes angels touch pure evil
That don't mean they stop
They can fight for what's right and I will
'Cause I don't have the time to kill
And I, I don't have the will

If you see the light in my eyes, know I'm shining
I walk my road alone 'til here, so I'll keep writing
I don't need your love, I've been this far down
Back into the New York City
I've been sober for eleven years right now
If that don't mean a thing, well, I try

Sometimes bad things happen to good people
And sometimes angels touch pure evil
And I won't stop, I won't fight
I'll just stray towards the light
'Cause I know sometimes bad things happen to good people
And that's mine

Jesus, walk with me
I don't have anything I can offer up to you
But Jesus can comfort me
I don't really wanna drink, some pot will do
Heaven is on Earth
I have peace and that's more than you
I can live in the light like a maniac
In the stars attack, in the zodiac

So ride for the first time and die for the last time
I'm with the angels and I'm stressed in the back row
Keeping me harder, I try and I start
But I'm scared I won't catch up and it don't matter

Sometimes bad things happen to good people
And sometimes angels touch pure evil
And I will fight for the right
To keep on making art out of my life
Fight for the right to be different
In a world full of fake bitches

// Methamphetamines //

Methamphetamines, pink flamingo
Blue 50's queen, blue oyster cove
For the big dream, why don't we go
To Coney Island?
When the hour numb the guy lies on
The record spins blue '50s song
The veranda looks ocean now
Neon palms sway
What's happening? Where did we go?
The Jersey Shore was long ago
As with our hopes and ocean grove
And so I bid you farewell

But it doesn't mean
You can't come in
And get cool
Get cool, get cool (Oh-oh)
Get cool, oh-oh, ah (Oh-oh, ah)
Get, get cool, cool!
Mmm

// Money Hunny //

Have you ever seen a dead man?
A dead man lying in the road
Have you ever heard his best friend?
Heard his best friend say you'd better go
Before you get fined
Or else you'll do time

Oh it's all about money, money
Money hunny
It's all about money, money
Well alright

Have you ever seen an old man?
Seen an old man living all alone
Have you ever heard an old man?
Heard an old man hear the way he moans?
Because he's so tired
Because he just got fired

Oh it's all about money, money
Money hunny
It's all about money, money
Well alright

Lately I've been
Feeling like the world is weighing
Down on me again
Ah ah ah ah ooh

Have you ever seen a broke man
Seen a broke man begging for his life?
Have you ever heard a broke man
Heard a broke man, heard the pain and strife?
In his one-line plea, in his dull-edged knife

He asking for money money yeah money hunny
He asking for money money well alright
Well alright
Well alright
Well alright

// More Mountains //

I top every mountain there's a hurdle in the sky
When at last you've found them you will understand as I
There is no solution
Life is without resolution

You must ask yourself what you really want in life
You must trust in me when I tell you it's alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright tonight

I remember New Year's that your everything seemed right
We had not made plans and we just drove all the whole night
Let's all go find a friend
Don't stop until the end

You must ask yourself, am I really the one?
You can't be of help if you can't have any fun
I'm your one if you want me to be
Please leave me be
Who are you to say a soul won't live forever
Yeah, yeah

Atop every mountain there's a hurdle in the sky
When at last you've found them you will understand as I
Each breath is sent from angels
These people, they are not strangers

You must ask yourself what you really want in life
You must trust in me when I tell you it's alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright tonight

Even my best days without you
Were nothing in comparison to my worst days
Once I had found you
Once I had you
I had everything
I had everything
I had everything
Please don't leave
It's all happening

When I was sleeping without you
Haunted by the baddest dreams
I asked you beside me
I have you, yes I have you
Smiling in your sleep
You would talk to me, in my wildest dreams
I never knew I'd find somebody like you
Like you
Like like
I'd find somebody like you
Like you
Like you

When I was sleeping without you
Haunted by the baddest dreams
At last you're beside me
I have you, yes I have you
Smiling in your sleep
Pillow talk to me
In my wildest dreams
I never knew I find somebody like you
Like you

// National Anthem (Music-Video Version) //

Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday, Mr. President
Happy Birthday to you
Thanks, Mr. President
For all the things you've done
The battles that you've won
The way you deal with US Steel and our problems by the ton
We thank you so much
Everybody

Money is the anthem
Of success
So before we go out
What's your address?

I'm your National Anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons
Bugatti Veyron

He loves to romance them
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom
Upper echelon

He says to "be cool" but
I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on?"
He said, "Yes, yes, yes"

Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Booyah, baby, bow down
Making me say wow now
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body downtown
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and
Baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem

Money is the reason
We exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss

I sing the National Anthem
While I'm standing over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me
Or your pants on
See what you've done to me
King of Chevron

He said to "be cool" but
I'm already coolest
I said to âget real",
âDon't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?â

Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Booyah baby, bow down
Making me say wow now
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body downtown
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and
Baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem

It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick sick rampage
Wining and dining
Drinking and driving
Excessive buying
Overdose and dyin'
On our drugs and our love
And our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely
I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his bell tower, hotel

Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara, and your party dress

I'm your National Anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and Danger
Queen of Saigon

Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Booyah, baby, bow down
Making me say wow now
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body down town
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and
Baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success

And I remember when I met him.
It was so clear that he was the only one for me.
We both knew right away.
And as the years went on things got more difficult,
We were faced with more challenges.
I begged him to stay,
Tried to remember what we had in the beginning.
He was charismatic, magnetic, electric, and everybody knew him
When he walked in every woman's head turned.
Everyone stood up to talk to him.
He was like this hybrid, this mix of a man who couldn't contain himself.
I always got the sense that he became torn between being a good person and missing out on all of the opportunities that life could offer a man as magnificent as him.
And in that way, I understood him.
And I loved him, I loved him, I loved him, I loved him.
And I still love him, I love him.

// Never Let Me Go //

Hold me in your arms
Love me like your best friends did
Promise I won't hurt you, kid
Hold me really tight until the stars look big
Never let me go

All the world is ours
Like they say in Scarface, kid
You can push your drugs and I can make it big
Singing at CBGB's, have a real good gig
Hey, you never know

'Cause, baby, we were born to live fast and die young
Born to be bad, have fun
Honey, you and me can be one
Just believe, come on

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay

We gonna go far
I can already taste it, kid
L.A.'s gonna look real good
Drive me in your car until the sky gets big
Never let me go

Send me to the stars
Tell me when I get there, kid
I can be your Nancy, you can be my Sid
Get into some trouble like our parents did
Hey, they'll never know

'Cause baby, we were born to be bad and move on
Built to go fast and stay strong
Honey, you and me, and no one
Just believe, come on

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay

I remember when I saw you for the first time
You were laughing, sparkling like a new dime
I came over, "Hello, can you be mine?
Can you be mine? Can you be mine?"

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Baby, it's a sweet life, sing it like a song
It's a short trip, only getting one
Can count on you, my love, more than anyone?
Never let me go

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay

Walking is an art, so is my body
Papi is a workaholic, I'm his little party
I'm Miss Parlor-Tricks, sips of the Bacardi
I can make you dope, sick from the naughtiness
He says, "Who the best?" You is!

I'm glamorous, famous
Notorious, dangerous, "But you're crazy"
"I'm gonna leave you,"
He said, "You're not a real girl
You're like a cartoon
All caught up in this fame game
Yo, good luck, good luck, good luck
May all the stars in the sky
Bow down to you, we're through."

You gotta be smart and I'm a little smarty
Papi is a gangsta, I'm his little dolly
Party favor favorite of them all
He says "Baby doll is so sick"
Sick off your naughtiness-ness-ness-ness-ness

Let's go to Vegas
He say "Who the best?"
He said "She is, she is but, yo
She crazy like in every single way
Like a hurricane
You gotta get out of the way
But she's hot, and she's cold
And she's cool and she's bold
And she's full of rage like me
And I like the game, yo"

Cause I'm glamorous I'm famous
Notorious dangerous but I'm crazy, yo
Glamorous dangerous
Notorious but famous but I'm crazy

He's gonna hate me
He wants a real girl
I'm like a cartoon
All caught up in this fame game
Yo, good luck, good luck
He said "We're through"

You, you light my red fire babe
Hot white, and blue
And I, I think that you
I think you're so cool, babe
Loving everything you do

You say we're gonna run away
Put on your sundress, summer day
Flying around on the highway

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and every day
Top down, gonna make a getaway, top down
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
You found me when I had lost my way
Foot down, we're going all the way, touchdown
Gonna make a getaway, top down

You know what I want
Take me to the K-Mart, pick me up pink lip gloss
How you get so hot?
You're making me crazy
Hoping you'll never stop

You say that we were meant to be
We'll be together finally
Flying around and I'm finally free

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and every day
Top down, gonna make a getaway, top down

Why do I think too much?
You tell me not to worry
Because you're the boss
And you, you got a real good plan
My trouble's all over now
Because you're my man

You don't know what you've done to me
You're heavier than heavenly
Life on the run has set me free, me free now

We're on our way

You tell me not to worry
Because you're the boss

You say you wanna make me smile and see my wild side
If we don't leave town now
We're never gonna get out of here alive
I'm walking home from school
My thoughts are drifting into space
Why don't we leave tonight
And take off to a different place?
Don't tell my daddy why
Gotta get on that plane and just fly

// Party Girl (St. Tropez) //

Standing on the rooftop
Just out of earshot
Looking at this gangster guy

Thinking he's a hot shot
Pouring me a big shot
Trying to get me drunk and high

He wishes to be seen with me in his limousine
And he says, "We'll have a real good time"
Well, XXO, but I want you to know

Every single night, in the lights I'll be sparkling bright
I'm just a party girl, trying to get my drinks for free from you
If you hold me tight, it's alright, let the fire ignite
I'm a party girl, and I'm just warning you

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on display
Bringing New York down to St. Tropez

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
I won't fall in love, I won't ever stop
I'm partying all night, I'm gonna make it pop

Kissing on your white yacht
Show me what you got got
Play a little rock n' roll
On an island hop stop, maybe we should dot dot dot
(Lose control)

Do you think it's really mean that I'm only on the scene
'Cause I want a little danger boy?
Well, XXO, but I told you so

Every single night, in the lights I'll be sparkling bright
I'm just a party girl, trying to get my drinks for free from you
If you hold me tight, it's alright, let the fire ignite
I'm a party girl, and I'm just warning you

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on display
Bringing New York down to St. Tropez

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
I won't fall in love, I won't ever stop
I'm partying all night, I'm gonna make it pop

It's not about us, just forget about us
Tonight
Put your cigarette down, baby, light up the town
Beside me

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on display
Bringing New York down to St. Tropez

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
I won't fall in love, I won't ever stop
I'm partying all night, I'm gonna make it pop

// Pin-Up Galore //

Pin up girls at the roller derby
Take me down to Newark, New Jersey
American flags
Blue, blue streamers
Everybody's laughing
The crowd is cheering

Baby, I've become someone
Baby, I've become
Baby, I've become someone
Not of this world
Not of this world

Dance at night back in Alabama
Christmas lights on my teal-green trailer
American flags
Blue, blue streamers
All the men are watching
The crowd is screaming

Baby, I've become someone
Baby, I've become
Baby, I've become someone
Not of this world

Prizes, prizes
A diamond tiara
Here's to the girl with the blue mascara
I have a disco ball mind
Lights flashing all of the time
I have a disco ball mind
I wanna die, I wanna die
I wanna die, I wanna die

Ooh, ooh

// Pink Champagne //

I don't really wanna die
I just want the pain to be over
I know that I talked about it all the time, babe
Just wanted you to come over
I got tired of America
It got hard to just stay sober
Then I met you and you blew my mind
That was it, game over

We could get lost in the purple rain
Talk about the good old days
I could get drunk on some pink champagne
Lost in the purple haze

Let me love me like you a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be your one time beauty queen
You don't know the world like I do
You don't know how good our love can be
Let me love me like you a woman
Let me take you to infinity
Baby, take you to infinity
Baby

I don't really wanna fly
I just want this tour to be over
I know that I dreamed about it all my life
Then the dream got closer
I miss the smell of America
Green palms, green clover
I can still feel it when I close my eyes
It comes right over

We could get lost in the purple mist
Think about the good old times
Let it come down like the ocean wave
Hold your body in my mind

Let me love me like you a woman
Let me love you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be your one time beauty queen

You don't know the world like I do
You don't know how good people can be
Let me love me like you a woman
Let me take you to infinity
Baby, take you to infinity
Baby

I n-n-n-need you
Don't, don't fucking leave yet
I need, n-n-n-need you
Don't fu-, don't fucking leave yet

Let me love me like you a woman
Let me love you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be your one time beauty queen

You don't know the world like I do
You don't know how good people can be
Let me love me like you a woman
Let me love you like a baby
Baby, take you to infinity
Baby, take you to infinity

Baby, get drunk on some pink champagne
Get lost in the purple haze

Biding my lines

I'm wearing the invisible crown

Touring up and tearing the town, a soul sinner, yes
Sometimes I rap too
I'm a white girl, but the world is my oyster
I'm a little pearl, yep

// Playing Dangerous //

Everybody knows I'm a good girl officer
No, I wouldn't do a thing like that, that's for sure
The house was already on fire, I swear I'm not a liar
Well I'm a little shaken, but I'm fine, thanks for asking
Tell me, do you always work alone so late?
Gosh, I'm a little shy standing here in my nightgown
Do you really have to put those tight handcuffs on?

Looking at me, then suddenly
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane, hurricane, hurricane

Let's get in the back of your cop car, officer
You can ask me anything you want
Anything, anything

Do you have a girl?
I don't see a ring on your finger
Well that's interesting have you
Ever thought of dating a singer?

The flames are getting higher
So is my desire
It's kind of exciting
Don't you think?

Then suddenly he is uncuffing me
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane, hurricane, hurricane

If you can't stand the heat
Then stay out of the fire
You might get what you desire
Boy, love is strange
Sometimes it makes you crazy
It can burn or break you

If you can't stand the heat
Then stay out of the fire
You might get what you desire

Sometimes it makes you crazy

Loving hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong

// Prom Song (Gone Wrong) //

Boy, it's late, walk me home, put your hand in mine
At the gate, stop and say, "be my valentine"
You are, by far, the brightest star
I've ever seen, and I never dreamed
I'd be so happy that I could die

You used to say that I was beautiful like Cleopatra
But you the king, too, so I would say, "Back at ya"
I flip my hair and make you stare and put my make-up on
And make up stories 'bout my life and put on very cherry bomb
And even then, I knew that we were something serious
That you would dominate my thoughts like radio to Sirius
I'd see you in the hall like, "Hello, hello"
Up against the wall like, "Let's go, let's go"

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

If you're lonely, baby, hold me, you're my only one
Watching television, kissing 'til we see the sun
So far, we are safe in the dark
And I never dreamed that I'd be the queen
And I'd be so happy that I could die

You used to call yourself The Don and call me Queen Diana
You always make me blush and say, "Shut up boy, you bananas!"
You pull my hair and push me down and chase me, make me run
You played me Biggie Smalls, and then my first Nirvana song
So even then, when no one's friends were really serious
I knew you loved me by the way you looked in second period
I'd see you in the hall like, "Hello, hello"
Up against the wall like, "Let's go, let's go"

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

I know that they say that all I want
Is to have fun
And get away for rainy days
I know that they think I've come undone
But I'm in love, I wanna run, run, run away
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

// Puppy Love //

It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love

You make me wanna be like one of those girls
From the 1950s wearing those big pearls
I'll cook you breakfast, coffee on your desk, yes
I might burn your toast but baby I'm still the bestest

It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love

You make me wanna be like one of those girls
On the color TV, it was a new world
The Dick van Dyke show, we're Cher and Bono
The way I sing "I Got You Babe", makes you say, "Oh, no."
Cause you're the class president without Jackie O
And I'm singing "Happy Birthday" like Marilyn Monroe

(One) This is not a school girl crush (No)
(Two) This is not puppy love (uh-uh)
It's the real thing when you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby

(One) This is not a school girl thing (No)
(Two) What about the diamond ring (uh-uh)?
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby

It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love

You make me wanna be like one of those girls
Calendar pin-up queen, in platinum curls
I'll do my summer pose, golden sand between my toes
You can pack my favorite snack, a Veuve Clicquot and Ho Hos
You're everybody's hero and you're hitting it hard
While I'm singing for the soldiers like Marilyn Monroe

(One) This is not a school girl crush (No) (Two)
This is not puppy love (uh-uh)
It's the real thing when you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby
(One) This is not a school girl thing (No) (Two)
What about the diamond ring (uh-uh)?
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby
And if I call you on the telephone, I might overdose
Cause I'm strong but I'm lonely like Marilyn Monroe
This is not a school girl crush
This is not puppy love

It's the real thing when you told me you loved me
What ever happened to hold me and trust me, baby (One)
This is not a school girl crush (No)

(Two) This is not puppy love (uh-uh)
It's the real thing when you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby
(One) This is not a school girl thing (No) (Two)
What about the diamond ring (uh-uh)?
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love

Got me sparkling just like an emerald
Set my soul on fire and make me wild

No other boy ever made me feel beautiful

Painted on my soul, it was indelible ('Cause you're the one)
Let's celebrate our twisted fate
We're the broken ones

Shut your complaining, aye-aye-aye-aye
You make me so angry, someone should pay me
Why don't you get the sty-y-y-yle?
Make me smile

Life's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance

Oh, honey, when you call me, I want to
Stay on the telephone for hours just to get you home
Oh, sugar, when you call me after school
I see your smile and I could run a methampheta-mile

I'll never forget it, oh, you'll regret it
Nowhere to kiss it, aye-aye-aye-aye
Take it or leave it, better believe it
You'll never see why-y-y-y
Say goodbye

Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance

New kind of porno
One that has yet been born, oh
Loving you's like loving a hurricane, I'm tired of
All the mess you make, all the hearts you break
Loving you's like loving a dirty bomb, you're blowing up
All the cash I'm paid, all the love we made

Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul

Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance
Your problem with commitment is
The bane of my existence

True love, it comes once
You messed it up, you stupid

// Roses //

(Uh, feeling's gone, feeling's gone)
(Uh, this love is dead)

You always buy me roses when I'm mad
Do you think I'll forgive you just like that?
Did you forget who you were seeing, yeah?
I'm not letting you off easy, I'm still sad

I'm kissing you hard, you got my lipstick on your face
I stole your girlfriend's keys, kicked her out of your place
Cause I want you more than I did before, -fore
I'm missing you hard, give you my soft-core baby face
And then we start to fight, tumble down the staircase
And when we hit that floor, you want me even more, more

And then you buy me roses and it's fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you're mine
I'll let you off easy, it's alright
And then you buy me roses and it's fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you're mine
I'll let you off easy, it's alright

You always buy me roses like a creep
Asking for forgiveness, unsexy
What happened to the man you used to be?
If you still want my love then work for me

You're kissing me hard, you got my lipstick on your face
You show me what you got and put a girl in her place
If you want me more than you did before
(Uh, feeling's gone, feeling's gone)

And then you buy me roses and it's fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you're mine
I'll let you off easy, it's alright
And then you buy me roses and it's fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you're mine
I'll let you off easy, it's alright

We had conversations, ain't nothing said
This girl is crazy, I've done lost my head
"Her life is awesome", the doctor said
But my shit feel awful, this love is dead

And then you buy me roses and it's fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you're mine
I'll let you off easy, it's alright
And then you buy me roses and it's fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you're mine
I'll let you off easy, it's alright

See I could see the pain
In her eyes, in her eyes
This love is dead
This love is dead

// Run Motorcycle //

This is stupid, this whole sober
This is stupid, this whole sober thing
All the boys with me like to drink
This is stupid, this whole music thing
I'm burnt out, and I don't wanna sing

But I've got nothing better, but my sleeve
If life can't be fun, then I guess I'll have to leave
I said, "Run motorcycle run"
Run motorcycle run

Am I lovely? Flowers in my hair
Do you love me? You, yes you over there
Everybody asks me who I am
I'm nobody, I'm only a man

And I got nothing better, but my sleeve
If life can't be fun, then I guess I'll have to leave
So I say "Run motorcycle run"
Run motorcycle run
Run motorcycle run
Run motorcycle run

// Serial Killer //

Wish I may, wish I might
Find my one true love tonight
Do you think that he could be you?
If I pray really tight
Get into a fake bar fight
While I'm walking down the avenue
If I lay really quiet
I know that what I do isn't right
I can't stop what I love to do
So I murder love in the night
Watching them fall one by one, they fight
Did you think you'll love me too?

Baby, I'm a sociopath
Sweet serial killer
On the warpath
'Cause I love you just a little too much
I love you just a little too much (much, much)
You can see me drinking Cherry Cola
Sweet serial killer
I left a love note
Said, you know I love the thrill of the rush
You know I love the thrill of the rush

I love you just a little too much
Love you just a little too much, much

My black fire's burning bright
Maybe I'll go out tonight
We can paint the town in blue
I'm so hot, I ignite
Dancing in the dark and I shine
Like a light, I'm luring you
Sneak up on you really quiet
Whisper, "Am I what your heart desires?"
I can be your ingenue
Keep you safe and inspired
Baby, let your fantasies unwind
We can do what you want to do

Baby, I'm a sociopath

// She's Not Me //

Down, down, down
Mm, uh-huh
Huh, let's go!

When you got her in the back seat
Driving round the back streets
Trying to block me out
(Do you remember my name?)
Cruising down Santa Monica Boulevard
Does it light up the spark?
(Do you remember my name?)

Is she your ride-or-die bitch
Does she know I'm tattooed onto your heart?
You can try to fight it
I have left my mark on you
There is nothing you can do

When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real-life suicide blonde
(You like that?)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

When you take her to Chateau Marmont
'Cause you booked the top suite
Lay her on the bed
(Do you remember my name?)
Strip her down to her bare ass
In her Kiki de Montparnasse
Like I used to have
(Do you remember my name?)

Is she your ride-or-die bitch
Does she make you shiver under your skin
Just the way that I did?
It won't be the same again
She don't compare to who I am

When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real-life suicide blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

You try to forget and you tell her that you miss her
But I bet every time you go to kiss her
You get a hot rush feeling on your lips
It's me taking over you, throwing you a curve ball
Reminding you of our true romance and
Just like the first time you learned to dance and
I showed you all those moves she can't do
She's not me (me, me)

When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real-life suicide blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me
When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real-life suicide blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

You were the freak king of the piercing shop
All the girls thought they could sing
But they're really not, shit, I don't get it
You're looking like a man, you're talking like a baby
How the fuck is your song in a Coke commercial? Crazy
I don't get it, your taste once exquisite

What happened to Brooklyn?
What happened to New York?
What happened to my scene?
What happened to punk rock, rock?

You called me the queen of the downtown scene, babe
How the fuck would you go switch it up and then replace me?
I don't get it, I'm so legit

Tell me, was it 'cause I wasn't platinum in jewels?
That perhaps, you thought I was a little bit of an uncool
Kid, was that it?

Stefani, you suck, I know you're selling twenty million
Wish they could have seen you when we booed you off in Williamsburg
You're hurt, I know my words don't hurt ya

Oh, girl, I see you walking 'round in your pearls
Thinking that you're number one
You're so funny, 'cause honey, you're not

What happened to Brooklyn, the last frontier?
They said you could make it anywhere if you can make it here
But where?
No magic in the air

What happened to Brooklyn?
What happened to our scene, baby?
Have we all gone Gaga crazy?
Remember when the streets used to be dangerous
And we were born bad?
And we were born bad?

Punk rock, punk rock
The boys used to punch each other in the face
And girls were walking 'round wasted
Everyone had a good night, come back in sunlight
Punk rock, rock, rock

Even the roses get up to walk to you
You're crazy but I knew that at the time
I just cannot resist your golden grill
And your stupid pickup line

Fly body, dope in the face
Fly body, dope in the face

There's something about you when you say
"Come on, come on with me babe."
And I don't know why but I know
Wherever you go, I'm gonna follow

Hey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you're dreaming of?
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine?
What makes you fall in love?

It's strange the way we met
A desert road and then
My car had stopped and you pulled off
On your black motorcycle
You rode me to the bar
We danced all night under
The Christmas lights and the dark black night
With the lightning and the thunder

Hey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you're dreaming of?
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine?
What makes you fall in love?

You took me to the edge
Of town, that's where you slept
You liked it best when no one else
Could find you or could bother
You poured us mint juleps
And kissed me the lips
You held me tight in the TV light
And you said you never loved her

You have a dark heart, like mine
Things that you've seen in dark time
Let me love you, let me touch you
Let me show you you'll be fine

Hey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you're dreaming of?
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine?
What makes you fall in love?

// Summer Of Sam //

Like the summer of Sam, back in '69
I'd be heavenly, deadly on the grind
'Cause to sing this nice has to be a crime
I be murdering and murdering 'em

Like the summer of love back in '69
You can say that I'm yours, but my body is divine
I belong to everybody that I walk by
Like hi, hi
I'm the master of my destiny
You haven't seen the best of me
And if you want the rest of me
You'll have to pay a lovely fee
Hard to stay far, far away from me
'Cause I am the baddest girl in NYC
You can look but please don't touch, boy
Stay away from me

Baby, I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it fresh on the far east side
Baby, I'm a tenement girl
Keeping it in touch, your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Baby, I'm a dangerous girl
You should stay away from me

I've been murdering and murdering 'em
I be murdering and murdering 'em

Like the summer of Sam, back in '69
I'll be tying them up, and hang 'em out to dry
'Cause I'm hot like that when I walk, they die
I be murdering and murdering 'em

Like the summer of love back in '69
When I get on the microphone my, my
They be looking at each other like ay, ay, ay
Like bye, bye

Please excuse m-my vivacity, capacity for hating
'Cause it's incredible
It's better if you stay away from me
I know it's hard, hard to stay far, far away from me
I am the baddest girl in NYC
You can look but please don't touch
But boy, step away from me

Baby, I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it fresh, on the e-east side
Baby, I'm a tenement girl
Keeping it in touch, your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Baby, I'm a dangerous girl
Baby, you should stay away from me

I've been murdering and murdering 'em
Happily
Murdering and murdering 'em ah, ah
Murdering and murdering 'em

I'm diggable, predictable
No, everyone knows all my people
I'll give you a fistful
You know you'll be in a fight
Unmissable, invincible, behavior is despicable
If you're looking for fun you can come out with me tonight

I am the baddest girl in NYC
I am the baddest, ya liking what you see? Yup!

Baby, I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it sweet, on the far east side
Baby, I'm a tenement girl
Keeping it in touch, your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Honey, I'm a dangerous girl
You should stay away from me

// Summer Wine //

Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things

I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to
A song that I had only sang to just a few
She saw my silver spurs and said, "Let's pass some time
And I will give to you summer wine."
Oh, summer wine

Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Mm, summer wine

My eyes grew heavy and my lips, they could not speak
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamiliar line
And then she gave to me more summer wine
Mm, summer wine

Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Mm, summer wine

When I woke up, the sun was shining in my eyes (in my eyes)
My silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size (in my eyes, uh)
She took my silver spurs, a dollar and a dime (Uh, Uh)
And left me craving for more summer wine
Oh, uh, summer wine

Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Mm, summer wine
Mm, summer wine
Mm, summer wine

// Summertime Sadness (Cedric Gervais Remix) //

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzling like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

I'm feeling electric tonight
Cruising down the coast, going about 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzling like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

// Summertime The Gershwin Version //

Summertime
And the living is easy
Fish are jumping
And the cotton, the cotton is high

Oh, your daddy, he's rich
And your ma, she's good looking
So hush, little baby
Don't you cry

One of these mornings
You're gonna rise up singing
You gonna spread your wings
And take, and take to the sky
Until that morning
Ain't nothing can harm you
With daddy and mammy standing by

Standing by
Standing by, little baby
Standing by

// Super Movie //

Drop me off at the Copacabana
You're my one true love, aren't you man, ah?
I'm your little Super 8 movie
You know I'm in love with ya truly, yeah
So when, baby, if you
Don't get down (ah ah ah)
Don't get down

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
It's finally time to make a safe get away
I could not be happier

Drop me off, Santo Casino
I got an idea, why don't we go to Mexico?
Like we said we would, and you, don't want, want to
But I think, I think it'd be good for you, Billy
You never want to do nothing anymore and I
Remember the days when you used to sway and you'd

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
It's finally time to make a safe get away
I love you, baby

What happened to us? Me and you?
I was funny once and you were funny, too
One day, we woke up and I found that we had grew
And only I wasn't me, I had come out blue
And you, I don't know what to make of you
You're not a color, you're more of a shape
Of your former self, like they say, babe
I remember the days when you'd

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
And I'll continue always to keep that way

Yellow, red or blue
Don't matter to me if it don't matter to you
We'll just keep on trucking and see what we do and
I remember every way that you love me, baby

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
Top down, howling "Vegas" all the way
We almost had it all, didn't we, baby?

// Teenage Wasteland //

Boy, it's late, walk me home
Put your hand in mine
At the gates stop and say
"Be my Valentine."

You are by far
The brightest star
I've ever seen
And I never dreamed
I'd be so happy
That I could die

Used to say that I was beautiful
Like Cleopatra
But you the king too so I would say
"Back at'cha!"

I flip my hair and make you stare
And put my make-up on
And make up stories 'bout my life
And put on Very Cherry Bomb

And even then I knew that we were
Something serious
That you would dominate my thoughts of
Radio Two serials

I'd see you in the hall like
"Hello, hello"
Up against the wall like
"Let's go, let's go!"

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste
Within this teenage wasteland

You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place
Now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

If you're lonely, baby, hold me
You're my only one
Watching television, kissing
'Til we see the sun

So far, we are
Safe in the dark
And I never dreamed
That I'd be the queen
And I'd be so happy
That I could die

You used to call yourself "the Don"
And called me "Queen Diana"
You always make me blush I say
"Shut up, boy, you bananas."

You pull my hair and push me down
And chase me, make me run
You play me Biggie Smalls and then
My first Nirvana song

So even then when no one's friends
Were really serious
I knew you loved me by the way
You looked in second period

I'd see you in the hall like
"Hello, hello"
Up against the wall like
"Let's go, let's go!"

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste
Within this teenage wasteland

You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place
Now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

I know that they say
That all I want
Is to have fun
And get away for rainy days

I know that they think
I've come undone
But I'm in love
I wanna run, run, run away

I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste
Within this teenage wasteland

You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place
Now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

// Television Heaven //

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Mm-mm, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Come on, come on

I hope you remember me like this
Smoking cigarettes in my sundress
Glamorous and gangster, oh yes
(My battle lines look like paradise next to you)
I hope I remember you just like that
Looking fresh to death in your ball cap
You say you'll tap it like a hi-hat
(Your stupid lines, they're like dynamite)

The future's looking bright as black tonight
You tell me that our love cannot endure
Baby, if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right
Oh, I don't know a thing of this, I'm sure

There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathing heavily
The way you're smiling, it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swinging in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothing but that t-t-television on
We're kissing in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you
(And now, here's Johnny!)

I wonder if you'll think of me like this
On your fire escape like a hot mess
You say, "You're beautiful but hopeless"
("Come on inside, oh, you crazy child, look at you")
I promise that I'll think of you as the king
Quoting Corleone like you're so mean
It's Cosa Nostra 'cause it's our thing
(I made you mine like a thousand times)

Lucy's in the sky with ice tonight
Heaven knows I've tried hard to find a cure
Baby, if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right
And if you ask again, I'll say I'm sure

There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathing heavily
The way you're smiling, it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swinging in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothing but that t-t-television on
We're kissing in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you

Stay up tonight, turn out the light
It feels so right, baby, you're a vision in blues
Stay up tonight, turn out the light
It feels so right, watching television with you

There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathing heavily
The way you're smiling, it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swinging in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothing but that t-t-television on
We're kissing in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you

Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skip-a-dee-doo-dah day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A

Good morning, morning, hello sunshine
Wake up sleepy head
Why'd we move on that bojangle clock
So far away from the bed?

Just one more minute, that's why we moved it
One more hug or two
Do you love waking up next to me
As much as I love waking up next to you?

Well you make the coffee and I'll make the bed
I'll fix your lunch and you'll fix mine
Now tell me the truth, do these old shoes look funny?
Honey, it's almost nine

Now you be careful, gotta go
I love you, have a beautiful day
And kiss the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A

Skip-a-dee-doo-dah
Thank you Lord for making him for me
And thank you for making life turn out
The way I always thought it should be

There once was a time when I could not imagine
How it would feel to say
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A

Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skip-a-dee-doo-dah day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A

Chandeliers and seizures, honey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly
I can't be with the man I love
I can't be, if he treats me rough
I can't see him, I can't call him up
All that's real to me is trailer parks and beaches
Alabama breezes
Platinum and peaches, honey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly
I can't be with the man I love
I can't be, if he treats me rough
I can't see him, I can't call him up

You are the love of my life
And if you don't wanna talk to me
Well, then I think that's alright

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love

Knowing you are hurt inside
I think of all your happy times
Oh, my
When I ask what I can do
You say remember me the way I was six months ago, oh
I could do so much more for you, y'know
I could make you well if you just asked me to
Oh

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
I'll do anything
For you or for him
Or whoever else needs some help out there
I swear, I swear

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
Always

Think of you on quiet nights
At traffic lights and
Every highway and
I get a little scared sometimes when
Everyone I meet I find has
A friend

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love

// Tired Of Singing The Blues //

You know, sometimes I think God is playing a little game with me
Looking down from heaven, laughing, and trying to see how much I can take
Because the way things go, it's like a joke
Nobody's had more shots at the moon, and missed, than me

It's like I got my life stuck, stuck on rewind
Trying to make something of myself, life's got something else in mind
I'm fighting a losing game and I'm biding my time
You won't be my man, do I understand? No, stop
I don't want to hear another word about your 'Why not's'
I bought your bullshit all before, now you trying to sell me more, babe?

Man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired

I'm walking down the streets, you wouldn't know what I was thinking
It's just another white girl day, hey ribbons in my hair, and I am sinking down
A double life, a sordid past, and I am drinking now
I want to be bad, you say you were glad to see me, shut up
I don't want to know another thing you think you know about me
I'm not who you think I am, smiling, but I ain't happy

Man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired

Oh, I'm so far gone, I can't turn off my mind
It's like a ticking time bomb
Trying to kill me from inside
Haunting day and night
Is there no remedy for memory?

I've felt this way before I've known the depths of utter desperation
My boyfriend says I'm like an old movie star with loneliness as my occupation
I know that he's right but I don't care tonight
I want to be bad, I want to be bad, I can't stop
I keep running around the same town, knocking you down, I'm fucked
How can I get out when there's nowhere to go for miles around?

A man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired

// TV In Black And White //

If you get lonely, think of me only
Prison isn't going to keep me from you
Remember Coney Island and how we
Went into the water, 'til the waves turned blue?
Nobody does have to know that our love's alive
Keep it on the low if you want to hide
Got that same address if you want to write
One Greenwich Avenue, wishing and thinking of you

Living without you's like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When I'm around you, suddenly, I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

If you get lonely, think of this only
Heaven hasn't forgotten about you
Though you can't hold me, pick up and phone me
Use your one phone call on your ex girl, boo
I won't tell a single soul how you spend your nights
In that single cell, holding your pillow tight
If you really are afraid, then you ought to know
That you're the one I want, the one I want forever more

Living without you's like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When I'm around you, suddenly, I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

I know you get scared sometimes, boy
Nothing to be feared when you're in my heart
Troubles come in threes but in your case
They came in millions and trillions, but that's all right

Living without you's like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When I'm around you, suddenly, I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white

// Unidentified Flying Bill //

Bill takes me down to the beach
In the coat that he got from his father
He whispers to me that sometimes
He thinks he sees things over the water
Like maybe UFOs or something
Flying in the air
Well, I don't know about those, Bill
But I don't care

Slow burn, I'm hot like a fire
I'm sober, but you're getting higher
Life is so crazy, I can't take it
But at least we've got the night
We still got tonight

Bill takes me down to the beach
In East Hampton and walks on the water
Says they don't know it yet
But I'm the second coming of the Father
And he keeps on fishing
Tryna turn one into twenty
He's turnin' the ocean into wine for the summertime

Slow burn, I'm hot like a fire
I'm sober, but you're getting higher
Life is so crazy, I can't take it
But at least we've got tonight
We still got tonight
We still got tonight
We still got tonight

Tell it to me
Tell me I'm wrong
Come to me
Come to me
Tell me I'm wrong
Come to me
Send me, now
Tell me I'm wrong

Ohh

Slow burn, I'm hot like a fire
I'm sober, but you're still getting higher
Life is so crazy, I can't take it
But at least we've got the night

You were afflicted by booze

Life is a velvet crowbar
Hitting you over the head
You're bleeding but you want more
"This is so like you," I said
Put yourself on back to bed

You were a dick with your crew
Always on the road

You wanna touch life so hard
Why can't you give it a rest?
You're not that bright for a star
Burned yourself out nothing left

Wait a little longer kid
What you want to grow up so fast for?
Why you doing like I did?
Didn't you say I got what I asked for?

But you're afraid to find out
Like me and climb out
But you're always close to me
You got a different story
It's the same damn thing
Got a long way, rest your feet
I know you can do anything

You were such a handsome boy
Don't you give up your glory
Why you want to hit them streets?
Didn't you never hear my story?

And it's fine to waste time
But you got a beautiful mind
And you're always close to me
You're a different kid
But it's the same damn thing
And it's a long way, you better rest your feet
I know that you want everything

That's what you told me
I still believe you
I still see it's true
I need you and I know you, dear
But if you've gotta make it then
I can take it from here

Wait a little longer kid
Didn't I never say I would miss you?
Don't go until I come home
Please don't go until I kiss you

And it's hard to grow up
But we all know it's tough
Yeah, you're always close to me
You have a different story
It's the same damn thing
You got a long way, c'mon and rest your feet
I know you can do anything

Why you always doing that?
Breaking up with me then making up
Just to make me mad

I think that you taste like rock candy
Sweet like beaches, leave me all sandy
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?
Young love don't always last forever
Wild horses can't keep us together
So what if you taste just like heaven
That don't make it right
Hot summer and cold watermelon
Your love stings like blood and a lemon
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?

Watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes
That don't make it right

Why you always doing that?
Playing guitar while I'm sleeping
Acting like a brat

I think that you're sweet like rock candy
Warm like beaches that leave me sandy
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?
Young love don't always last forever
Wild horses can't keep us together

Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?

He was a big wave surfer
Living down by Waimea Bay
We had a few friends
Never thought it would end

I remember an all white day with 8-story waves
He said, "Your eyes are gray." (Beautiful)
We were living on CÃ´te d'Alene
On Carol Lane, sun Manta Ray

Driving in our Mercury down to Waimea
Driving in our Mercury
Driving in our Mercury down to Waimea
Driving in our Mercury

I remember we came in May
And we changed our names to Lana and Ray
We be up 'til the sun rose, ay

You didn't think about anyone else
You didn't think about any of us
When you left that place
You didn't want to go anywhere else
Nothing could satisfy you 'til you left
So you went away

Where did you go?
Where are you now?
I ask about
So many of my friends
Oh, about their ends
What about us?
Are we just dust
On the floor again
I thought we were on the mend

You really put me in a quite a position
You got me struggling as a musician
With a song
You like to write about all of your problems
Put them in songs because you think it will solve them
But you're wrong

Why did you go?
I guess I know
Maybe my question is
Why must it come to this?
You talk about
Being strong, yeah
How I want to be
You and your melody

Trying to learn about something important
You keep taking up space, you're annoying
But I love you so
Yeah, you already know
They're trying to teach me about new ways of living
They're trying to teach me about ways of forgiving
But you make it hard
You're such a bad, bad boy

I love you anyway
No matter what they say
You were not approved
But you are on the moon
I care about
How this turns out
It's just more than I
Ever knew how to fight
I guess I won't
Tell me I have to
Tell me I have to
I know you could
I said I know you could
Where are you now?
I ask about

// What's A Girl To Do //

Don't tell me that I'm fine
You break me all the time when you don't mean to
Yo, heartbreak's not a crime
But maybe it should be when it comes to you
I don't really know why you do them things
But maybe now, baby, if I start to sing
I can knock a little sense into you

What's a stupid girl to do
When she loves somebody as fucked up like you
Where am I supposed to go
When the only boy I ever knew said no
Absolutely nothing

Don't tell me it's alright
You never really knew what you meant to me
I'm, I'm crying every night
Because everything's so strange when you're not with me

And I don't really know why you had to go
But I have to trust that only God can know
If I pray, maybe I'll find out what's true

What's a stupid girl to do
When she loves somebody as fucked up like you
Where am I supposed to go
When the only boy I ever knew said no
Absolutely nothing

Ahh, ahh, uh uh oh
Ahh, ahh, uh uh oh

You break me down
I get back up
You're telling me
I say "What's up"
Nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
Can't go back to you

What's a stupid girl to do
When she loves somebody as fucked up as you
And where am I supposed to go
When the only boy I ever loved said no
Absolutely nothing

Absolutely nothing, no
Absolutely nothing
Absolutely nothing, no
Absolutely nothing
Absolutely nothing, no

I used to dance every Saturday night
I used to shake it for him, shake it for him
I want to stay but there's something ain't right

Freedom's my love, God is my king
I'm a wild one

It's the middle of winter but in my mind it's summer, Mike
Used to move for you, move for you
Was a pleasure and the pleasure was mine

Try hard to remember the days
Sick as fucking cyanide
Diamonds and getting blazed
Your tattoos, still magnificent
No longer high, but you're not very different

Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive
It's just you and the sun, it's just you and the sun now baby

I get so damn tired
You set my soul on fire
Ignite me, inspired
Make me higher and higher

Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive

Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don't let it stop

All the gin joints
In all the towns in all the world
She walks into mine

// You Must Love Me //

Where do we go from here?
This isn't where we intended to be
We had it all, you believed in me
I believed in you

Certainties disappear
What do we do for our dreams to survive?
How do we keep all our passions alive
As we used to do?

Deep in my heart, I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess, what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me, you must love me

Why are you at my side?
How can I be, any use to you now?
Give me a chance, and I'll let you see how
Nothing has changed

Deep in my heart, I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess, what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me, you must love me, you must love me

// You're Gonna Love Me //

Cherry says that anytime
I think I have a good idea
That I should do the opposite
Of whatever it is I feel
And that's because I have a bad mind
And I have gold in my veins
But he says I got the purest heart
That he's ever seen

What'd God give me a brain for?
He won't help me use it
What'd God give me a plan for
If he won't help me do it?

You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you
You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you

Well I can tell that you're the type
To never trust a beauty queen
But I was never voted for nothing
And high school never meant
Anything to anybody
Never ever gave myself away
But even when I'm funny
You think I'm acting, so I say

What'd God give me a brain for
If he won't let me use it?
What'd God give me a plan for?
He never helps me do it

You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you
You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you

You say that you don't want to be hypnotized
But baby I, I don't want to hypnotize you
There's nothing from you that I want to take
I just want to be like you
(Maybe love you just a little bit)
Please

Jim, I'mma dedicate this whole album to you
You told me to get my way
That's exactly what I'm gonna do
I'm going to strike out, right now
I'm striking out right now with this song
But I can't help myself
I can't do right for long
You know that

What God give me a brain for?
He knows that I can't use it
I don't know why he'd give me a plan for
He never lets me do it

You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you
You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you

// You, Mister //

I'm doing alright, most of the time
In fact, yesterday, I was even doing real well and I
Think that I might claim you as mine
So that my head can rest and everybody can tell, and I

Had a strange dream and I
Called you at night and I
Had to make known that I wasn't alright
And say that I had you on my mind
Had you on my mind

I make it a point to rest through my day
To close my eyes and visualize my troubles away and I
Think of you here and I close my eyes tight
Somehow the vision of you near makes me feel alright and I

Had a strange dream and I
Called you at night and I
Had to make known that I wasn't alright
And say that I had you on my mind
Had you on my mind

Had you on my mind
Had you on my mind
Had you on my mind

// Young And Beautiful //

I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

Dear Lord, when I get to heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?

// Your Band Is All The Rage //

I think we're losing what we used to have, you know
You loved me better one year ago, oh
Don't let me down, don't let me down so low

But I won't be ashamed if you leave me
I won't be all that mad if you go
'Cause I know, yes I know

You always spending all that stupid time
With your band on the road
But your band is all the rage
So I've been told
But you can still come home
You can still come home when you want
And I won't be ashamed to take you back in
Won't be ashamed to put a kiss on your lips
'Cause I know, I know

Boy, don't call me up quickly on the phone
It's been five nights since I heard the tone of your voice
You act like everything's alright
But we both know, we both know that it's not
And it's far from ever being good again
Darling, I'm gonna love you forever
If you come back, I'll take you back in baby
Back in, baby, back in, back in

I love you more than I will even know
You're so special
I guess that's why you got it where you go
But when you get real big, baby
Remember that little old cowgirl
Waiting for you back in that Red River Valley
Waiting back in that Tallahassee
I love you

// Your Girl //

Carry me off the stage
I can't do this anymore
Been gone for 3 years
Is that enough for you boy?

Carry me to my bed, paint my toe nails blue
Tell me all about the things that you and I will never do

I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah

Carry me off the stage
Had too much to drink
Been on tour too long
And I've had too much time to think

Carry me to my bed
Lay me in a pillow town
Kiss me on my head
And remind me of the way we will not know

I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah

Late at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, laying in Versailles
You and I get to know one another

Late at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, baby you and I
Can get to know one another

Cause late at night, we have one life to kill
Oh you and I
Can get to know the thrill
Cause baby you're my sign
And I wanna get to know ya

I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah

(Ah)
(Ah)
(Ah)
