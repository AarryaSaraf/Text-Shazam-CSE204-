// Queen Of The Gas Station //

Give me coffee, king-sized cup
Come on, Kitty cat fill her up
What's your name, little buttercup?
That's for me to know and you to make up

Love casinos
Indian reservations
But, baby, if you love me
Take me to the gas station
Gas station

Look at you smoking in them neon lights
Under the thunder, yo, you look so nice
Made me wonder how you spend them nights
Me, I spend them looking for men I might like
Like you, like you, like you

I'm the kind of girl you dream of
And I'm trying to tell you what I dream of
And that's gas stations
With Slurpee machines and organs playing
Preferably with smoking inside
If you can swing it (swing it, swing it, swing it)
And I'd be real pleased if we could find one just like it
Again, again
Again, again
Again, again
Again, again, again, again, again

// Oh Say Can You See //

Oh say can you see
My stars
The night time is almost ours
To wander through alleys
And look at the bars
Nighttime is almost ours

The headlights from passing cars
They illuminate my face and
Leave me the dark
The voice of Nirvana says
"Come as you are"
And I will
Nighttime is almost ours

The sway of the hips and arms
Will cradle you from afar
They swing 'til you're tired
And send you to Mars
Nighttime is almost ours

// For K Part 2 //

Alright, you caught me, I don't play a good guitar but
What do you want from me, it's just a stupid bar and
I didn't promise anything, no
You think I'm pretty and you like the way I talk
I like your music and you like the way I walk
So, I think we're gonna get along

I like the way you wear your sweater off your shoulder
The way your hair comes down and makes you look older
How are you getting so handsome, my boy?

Pretty baby
Pretty baby

The way your face is shaped, I wonder if you know
The way you stand up and your silhouette glows
I'm electrified, I'll be up all night now
Use that voice, sing that song
And tell me to come on, to come on, come on
You won't hear no, you won't hear no

Pretty baby
Pretty baby
Pretty baby

// Jump //

Palm trees in black and white
Last thing I saw before I died
Palm trees in black and white
Was the last thing I saw before I died
Right line, right man
Right mixture of cocaine and heroin

Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you, do you wanna?

Hair thinning in the wind
Cadillac convertible with him
I was shot at 2 AM
You got the grin of a very old man

Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you, do you wanna?

Palm trees in black and white
You are a junkie on your window smiling wide
Palm trees in black and white
Lean forward and you close your eyes
Last fight, fuck them
Last words before you went under again

Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you, do you wanna?

Just do what you love
Just do what you can
Just do what you love
Just do what you can
Just do what you love
Do it better than
(Do you wanna?)

// Mermaid Motel //

Maybe we could go to Coney Island
Maybe I could sing the national anthem
Buy a white sweater for the last white day of the summer
Buy my purple wig for my mermaid video
Walk back to where I live in my motel on Neptune (Avenue)

You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off

(Maybe we could go to) Suede Tokyo
Or see Van Halen at their reunion show
Heavy metal hour on TV
Diamond Dave and Ray Lee
And you salute me, Miss America
Because I am, I am

You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off

Maybe we could go to Coney Island
Maybe I could sing you to sleep
God bless the universe, god bless the ocean
God bless you and god bless me
God bless you and god bless me

You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine

Well, I didn't know it would come to this but
That's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright with letting nice things go

Well, I pawned the earrings that you gave me
Golden metal flowers dangling
And I almost cried as I sold them off
And I don't mind living on bread and oranges, no, no
But I got to get to and from where I come
And it's gon' take money to go

Oh, no
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh

In the name of higher consciousness
I let the best man I knew go
'Cause it's nice to love and be loved
But it's better to know all you can know
I said it's nice to love and be loved
But I'd rather know what God knows

Oh, no
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no
Oh, no

I can do this once more
No man can keep me together
Been broken since I was born

Well, I didn't know it would come to this but
That's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright with letting nice things go
