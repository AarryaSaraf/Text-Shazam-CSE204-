// Drive By (For K) //

It was a drive-by Sunday night
Most of us were in bed all right
I turned down the light
Then I heard the sirens
Interrupt the silence

Is this what you wished
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime, commit a crime, commit a crime?

He was a nice guy, really bright
Making money's hard to do right
Guilty was his plight
Now he's in a jail cell
For some thirty years now

Is this what you wished
To be serving time?
Is this what you wished
To be serving time?
Is this what you wished
To be serving time, serving time, serving time?

K's a friend of mine
I think about him as he does time
Miss his white wine
Funny I don't feel free
Even though it's not me

Is this what you wished
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind, me behind, me behind?

Last year they decided
That his time is up and then he got retried
Double homicide
Sent him on to death row
Not to hang around though

Is this what you wished
Did you want to die?
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die?
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die, want to die, want to die?
Did you want to die, want to die, want to die, want to die?
Did you want to die?

// Next To Me //

Another day is over
Another day is done
Now I'm getting closer
To the rising sun

Hey, there, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, man, how you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me?

Another day is over
Another day is done
Another night I'm waiting
Waiting for the sun

Hey, there, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, man, how you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me?

Well, I don't know, little lady
You're awfully pretty
But I'm a nice man, I live a nice life
I have a nice house, I have a great wife
And I'm tired of making
Decisions without thinking

Another moon is shining
Another evening come
Another hour unwinding
Till the night is done

Hey, man, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, there, how are you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me, next to me, next to me?

// A Star For Nick //

Well you know it and I know it
I'm gonna be a star
You won't, you won't get me very far

Don't say hello
It's already time to go
Oh, the wind is carrying me home
Me home, me home again

Well you know it and I know it
I'm gonna be a star
You won't, you won't get me very far

You saw life back in the countryside
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, my soul rise up and go beyond, beyond
To what you know

// My Momma //

My momma wouldn't say you were a nice guy
But you're under forty and you have a job
My momma wouldn't say you was a good boy
But you're making money and you're working hard so

I'm gonna take you on, I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along

My momma, she would say your hair was too long
But your hair exactly is what I like the best
And my momma she would say you was a hoodlum
But I'd have known a hoodlum and you don't pass the test

I'm gonna take you on, I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along

Oh, baby, you're standing so close, I can't back down
You're smiling and I know, I'm over and done now
I am done now

My momma'd say that it was wrong to see you
I lied just to meet you, I lied to get in
My momma she would say that I deceived you
But that's the only way I knew how to begin

So maybe you got your own problems, who doesn't?
I'm crazy, you're addicted, we are all of a sudden

My momma, she would love you like I love you
If she ever met you, if she ever knew
My momma, she would fall right on top of you
If she ever saw you, she'd be smitten, too

I'll never take you home, I want you all for my own
Don't let my momma hear your pretty song
I'm gonna take you on, I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along

// Bad Disease //

Well, there is something about watching a crime
It makes me want to go out and make it all mine
It's something about seeing you fight
It makes me want to go out tonight

I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, it's true

There's something about seeing him die
That puts it all into perspective and I
Want to stay home, be left alone
Someone make my mind up so I don't have to decide

I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, I do

There's some reason why I can't sit still
Every waking moment I feel so unfulfilled
I try to lie down, but I don't know how
Baby, when I'm sleeping, it feels less like I am dreaming

Oh, my god
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees

There's a fear I have of feeling real bad
I'm fine now, if I find out that I'm not I'll be sad
I try to quiet the thoughts in the night
Oh, they got me thinking, I'd be happier just drinking

It's not true
And I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees
Oh, no
I got a bad disease
Will no one help me please?
Not even you?

// Out With A Bang //

Little bits and pieces fall into the corners
Box of broken laces, lined up in an order
I'll do what you tell me, we can have it your way
I'll tell you the future, you tell me your story

I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

Smiles from a stranger, seem to change your day when
You were just about to go and throw your towel in
Lately I've been thinking about making changes
It's been on my mind for some time and I'm anxious

I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

Scowling like the sunshine, set on Sarasota
Happy like a twister over Oklahoma
Clear as Penny Mason lying in a coma
This is how I feel when all my hurt is over

I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

Meet me in the morning, wrap your arms around me
Tell me that it's over, now that you have found me
Walk me to the river, see the willow bowing
Carry me into the water, now we're drowning

We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're going to go home again

// Dear Elliot //

You didn't think about anyone else
You didn't think about any of us when you left that place
You didn't wanna go anywhere else
Nothing could satisfy you 'til you left
So you went away

Where'd you go?
Where are you now?
I ask about, so many of my friends
Oh, about their ends
What about us?
Are we just dust on the floor again?
I thought we were on the mend

You really put me in quite a position
You got me struggling as a musician with a song
You like to write about all of your problems
Put them in songs because you think it would solve them
But you're wrong

Why did you go?
I guess I know
Maybe my question is, why must it come to this?
You talk about being strong, yeah
And how I want to be you and your melody

Trying to learn about something important
But you keep taking up space, you're annoying
But I love you so
Yeah, you already know

They're trying to teach me about new ways of living
They're trying to teach me about ways of forgiving
But you make it hard
You're such a bad, bad boy

I love you anyway
No matter what they say
You are not a prude, but you are on the move
I care about how this turns out
It's just more than I ever knew how to fight
I guess I won't

Tell me I have to, tell me I have to
I know you could
I said I know you could
Where are you now?
I ask about

// Try Tonight //

Can't put my finger on it
But I know I want it
I'm willing to try another way
That is, if I get by another day
Back and forth, I don't get anywhere
And I've been searching everywhere

And I'll try tonight
Just try tonight

Happy as the moon shine
Sifting in the night-time
Clichés find a home inside of him
When he enters all of the lights go dim
He's so sure he's got a tragic lifestyle
And I'm so sure I can make that man smile

And I'll try tonight
Just try tonight

A dark room in the night-time
Is how he spends all his time
If he could go on without your help
Then he would do it all by himself
But I don't think he got strength to muster
And he don't got a lot – lacklustre

He'll try tonight
To not get high
He'll try tonight
To not get high
But he will, he will, he will, yes he will

// Peace (All You Need) //

You have a right
To live your life
Like no one else does
Like no one else might
If you have visions
Come on and live them out

All you need
Is some peace
While you are here
Just let go
Till you are home, dear

I had a dream
When I was young
I dreamt our lives were
Going to be found
When we were always
Waiting to live

All you need
Is some peace
While you are here
Just let go
I'll be it all, dear

You have the choice
To hear the noise
Or hear the sweet sound
Of your sweet voice
I know I've heard it
I heard it in my sleep

All you need
Is some peace
While you are here
Just let go
Don't say no, dear

Wake up each night
At the same time
Pull up the blind
And look outside
And in the orange light
The fog is rising

This is life
The still night
Peace in the quiet
Happiness
Is the sky

// I'm Indebted To You (How Do You Know Me So Well?) //

What an unusual name, you said
What a spectacular redhead
You really seem like a prize to me
And you are so mysterious
When you are not delirious
Oh what you mean to me

And she said, how do you know me so well
After only one night?
How do I love you, tell me
With all of my might

I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you
Always

There's something she doesn't know about
A secret he doesn't show about
A sensitive side all his own, oh my
She got her skeletons as well
Some secrets he know she'd never tell
People who keep her alone

And she said
"How did I know you so well, why am I not surprised?"
He said, "Baby, go to hell."
And that was the demise of their love
Don't ever pick up a man if you don't think he'll understand
Don't ever trust yourself if you have a history of being a loving fool

So that's what she got when she married him
A lifetime promise to carry him
Him and his every second of need
I do not know you so well
Not more than that one night
Do you still love me, oh tell me
With all of your might?

I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you, my love

// Pretty Baby //

Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I touch you
Then I won't touch you no more, yeah
Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I love you
Then throw my love on the floor

My mean daddy, my bad baby
Don't you want me?
I don't believe you when you say
You want to leave

Darling, honey, if you don't think that you're gonna want me
Then, honey, let me know
Listen, honey, I don't wanna keep thinking you love me
Just to find out you don't

My mean daddy, my bad baby, don't you want me?
I don't believe you when you say you want to leave

Aren't you gonna miss me?
Honey, I'll miss you
I just wanna kiss you, tonight

Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I hold you
Then, honey, let me go
Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I told you
Then, baby, tell me so

My mean daddy, my bad baby, don't you want me?
I don't believe you when you say you want to leave

// Aviation //

Do you think I'm crazy
For considering aviation?
I'm a fan of flying
Why not do it for the nation?
Cause I have nothing else to do
This summer but commit it to you
Have a big degree in philosophy
But I don't know what I want to be

So I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
Going into aviation
I'm going into aviation

Do you think I'm crazy
Cause I'm up and leaving, baby?
Well, I ain't got nobody
And I ain't got no money, baby, yeah
I feel high as I might tonight
So lean back and enjoy the ride
And the weather is clear, yeah, nobody is near
The future is not here

So I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
Going into aviation
I'm going into aviation

Do you think I'm crazy
Cause I'm going to Pensacola?
Where nobody knows me
Where someone could just start over
I'll be all right in a month or two
Cause it's warm there in the winter, too
Think New York is great, I really like the state
But it's time to be on my way

I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
I'm gonna take a vacation, yeah, man
Fly fighter jets all over the nation
Fly fighter jets all over the nation

// Move //

Snow is coming down like rain
I'm at it myself again
A little tired, even more confused
Come on, baby, don't be shy
You can say what make you high
I see the way you be lying, be abused

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
I don't care what you think

Breathing getting fast again
Now I'll start my worrying
When will I learn that there ain't nothing I can do?
Jesus was a dying man
If he can't do it, no one can
When will you learn that we ain't nothing without you?

We don't need anybody when we're down
We don't really find it hard to get around
We'll find our own way back to town
And oh, don't you tell us how we need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
We don't, we don't care what you think

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody but me
And I don't care what you think

// Junkie Pride //

You have this way of making me
Say the opposite of everything I mean
I kiss you, I hug you
But I could not feel less connected from you

I know I wanted all this in the beginning, I really tried
I know I caught you at a not-so-happy time of your life
My dreams are bigger than your junkie pride

I don't quite fit the part of
She who loses everything and falls into insanity
The sunbeams mean nothing
If you can't find the light shining in one thing

I know I wanted all this in the beginning, I really tried
I know I caught you at a not-so-happy time of your life
My dreams are bigger than your junkie pride

It's fine if you're hateful
As long as all in all you remain grateful

It made me nervous to know you didn't like me, I really tried
The way I'm feeling in this moment, it can't last my whole life
My dreams are bigger than your junkie pride

// Birds Of A Feather //

Met you in front of a diner and you had blue hair
You were so nice
You were from L.A. but you were all there
You were all right

So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather

Met you in front of a diner and you were so sweet
Made my heart beat, oh, my, my, my, my, my
I met you with your mother and she had green shoes
She was so cool, it was fine, fine, fine, fine, fine

So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather
Oh, feather, oh, birds

You were sorting pictures and you gave me one
Of a nun who was playing the drums
She was crazy, her name was Katie
I think you're so fun

So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather

You don't think I'm that strange, you're so weird
That's 'cause you're so queer
But who's not these days?
You wear purple socks and you still like Purple Haze

So many people think that you have it together
But they don't see you crying in the shower
Bet I can make you better
'Cause you make me better
Yeah, you make me better
Yeah, you make me better
