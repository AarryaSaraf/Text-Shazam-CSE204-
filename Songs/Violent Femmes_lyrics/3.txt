Album: 3

// Nightmares //

It seems that the problem is very deep
'Cause every time I try to sleep
I have nightmares
Thinking about 
Getting together with you 

No, no, I wouldn't say so
I would not call it a curse
But what worries me then
Is when I wake up if it might be worse

// Just Like My Father //

I'm just like my father
but I am much worse 
he hurt his mother 
I hurt mine worse 
I'm just like my brother 
he hurt his wife 
I hurt mine first 
it hurts to be like Cain 
ain't no way 
I'm not able 
y'know what I mean 
he hurt my mother 
I hurt her worse 
never stop the 
never stopping

// Dating Days //

Three women 
in thirty days 
tell me seriously 
our dating days 
are over and done 
are dead and gone 
it seems that no matter how much I drink 
I seem to still stay sober 
it seems that no matter how young I am 
I seem to still feel older 
three men are going to hell 
thirty women are going to jail 
Jonah swore he swallowed the whale 
thirty thirsty women 
three hundred women in three hours 
told me boy forget the flowers 
Christ told a man called 1 legion 
come into the fold and start preachin' 
your devil days are over and gone 
your weary days are dead and done 
your happiness has begun

// Fat //

I hope you got fat
I hope you got really fat 
'Cause if you got really, really fat
You just might want to see me come back
I hope you got fat

I don't care, I don't care
How heavy or how skinny
I don't care, I don't care
No, how heavy or how skinny

Just gimme, gimme something to love
A little extra weight would never look 
No nicer on nobody else but you
And I could always use a little bit more to hold on to

And if I get a fright in the middle of the night
I'll cling to you
I hope you got fat
I hope you got really fat
If you got truly fat, fat, fat
You just might want to see me come back

// Fool In The Full Moon //

I've been following women all afternoon
I've been following women all afternoon
don't turn around 
too soon 
I've been following you all afternoon 
following you a fool in the full moon 
something's got a hold on me when I get a hold of you 
following women 
after dark 
nobody knows what's in my heart 
let your loving be 
I'm a lechery 
I do not spread leprosy 
I will not touch but let me see 
my building's burning down and i cannot breathe 
following you 
who won't believe 
perfect peace I cannot perceive 
when I'm following you I'm a fool in the full moon

// Nothing Worth Living For //

There's nothing worth living for tonight 
Tell me that there's something worth living for tonight 
Don't let me down 
Don't let me drown 
The pain is somewhere very close to me

// World We're Living In //

I can't go out no more
I just better stay at home
I can't go out no more
I just better stay all alone

'Cause what am I gonna do
If I see someone I'd like to do something to
What am I gonna say
If I see someone I'd like to say something to
If I see someone who'd like to do something too

I can't help being careful
Did you notice the world
That we're living in
Did you notice, did you see
Something might happen to me
Ddid you notice a chill in the wind 
People are dying
Just because they had a little
Girlfriend is not my girlfriend
Ny neighbor is not my lover
Boyfriend is not my boyfriend
My brother is not my lover
Behavior is not my behavior
My neighbor is not my savior
Didn't you notice the world
That we're living in

// Outside The Palace //

I've been outside the palace 
I've been outside the gate 
I still don't feel that I made any mistake 
when I got off that train 
I felt my feet hit the ground 
I didn't want to go 
where that gravy train was bound 
GOD help me to see 
I've been loved all along 
and not to get too confused 
between the moonlight and the dawn 

if I go back to the palace 
I'll walk right thru' the gate 
nobody knows how much here was at stake 
I might get on that train 
in feel the wheel on the train 
move it on up the mountain like a foregone fact 
GOD help me to know 
I've been in love my whole life 
and not to get so confused 
between the struggle and the strife

// Telephone Book //

I look at my telephone book 
I can't stand the way it look 
I hate to think the way you took 
me down into a burnin' rage 
I wrote your name on every page 
but you don't return my calls 
you don't return my calls 
you don't return my calls 
I'm ready to bust down the walls 
I'm going down Niagara Falls 
in a barrel of fun 
hey ain't I a lucky one 
you don't return my calls 
my telephone book is the color red 
my telephone book is the color red 
the red is all in my head 
some things are left better unsaid 
is that why you don't try 
to acknowledge or reply 
you don't return my calls 
why did you hear from an old friend 
I knew once way back when 
I did some bad things to myself and my health 
or did you happen to hear an old song I once sang 
did it make your sweet sweet blood run cold in your veins 
and will you never think of me the same

// Mother Of A Girl //

You look like you could be the mother of a girl 
a girl I hated more than any other girl in the world 
the way I let her treat me was totally a disgrace 
I wanted to permanently wipe that smile off her face 
no I'm not joking 
yes I was choking 
You look like you could be the mother of a girl 
a girl I loved more than any other girl in the world 
the way that i treated her was totally a crime 
I wanted to permanently wipe the joy out of my mind 

no I'm not joking 
yes I was choking 
You look like you could be the mother of a boy 
who bored me more than any other man in the land 
the way that he dogged me like I was totally a jerk 
I wanted to permanently pound his prick into the dirt 
no I'm not joking 
yes I was choking

// Lies //

Well, I'm reading this poem
and it's so profound 
and I like its rhythm 
and I like its sound 
it's by a very famous poet 
no critic can criticise 
and then I pause a moment 
and I start to realize 
he's tellin' 
lies lies lies 
on the motel TV. 
I dig the evangelist 
he'll tell you all about that 
and then he tell you all about this 
he's preachin' up a storm 
by the sea of Galilee 
he's mixin' up the truth 
with something funny I start to see 
he's tellin' 
lies lies lies 
I never had this problem 
with nobody in the government 
I guess I always figured 
they never mean what they meant 
and GOD help us all 
not to be so stone surprised 
when we wake up in the stars 
with the skies in our eyes 
if we keep tellin' 
lies lies lies

// See My Ships //

See my ships 
they are sailing 
in and out of the harbor 
will they go together 
or must they stay apart 
yes I know it's in my heart 
surely you see what's inside of me 
Jesus is coming soon 
I can hear Gabriel 
blow his trumpet tune 
this I know 
this I know 
our lord is coming soon 
mercy mercy me 
Marvin Gaye he was shot 
by his father 
o my Father 
have mercy on me 
cold kane o my cheap thrill 
o my shame for Cain 
and the devil 
momma I need water 
I'm thirsty 
surely you see 
what's inside of me
