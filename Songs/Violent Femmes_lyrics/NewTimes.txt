// Don't Start Me On The Liquor //

Don't start me on the liquor
I'll drink it all down straight
I'll make a toast to love
But I drink the most
When I got somebody to hate
I'm an old man
I got an old man's pain
Will the morning
Will the morning ever come again
Well, I'm likin' lickin' a lotta liquor
I'm drivin' down the drink
I'll take a toast to life
But I drink the most
When my devil start to think
I'm an old man
I got an old man's pain
Will the morning
Will the morning ever come again
Oh, I could drink, drink, drink
So I can't think, think, think
I got a hope or a home
In this life I'm all alone

On this long cold lonely night of fright
Followed by a lonely day 
'Til there's nothing left I can say
Except I didn't know I was sick
And so I got sicker
He's a low down lying
Peckerwood cotton picker
Don't start me on the liquor 
I got nothing more to say
I had a little money
But it all flown away
And I said oh man
Oh, ain't that a shame
Oh, I keep manin', I keep manin'
LIke I got an old man's pain
Don't 
Don't start
Don't start me
Don't start me on
Don't start me on the
Don't start me on the liquor

// New Times //

New Times. New Times. New Times.
Good morning. Good morning. Good morning.
I'm the guard. At one time
This was rather pleasant
The poets they still had to muse
Over the classicism of clean shoes
But who today still knows a button stick
Well, that's the new times
That's the new times
That's the new times
The girls would lie down before us
First one went dancing, then behind the bushes
Today you have to run through twenty places
Get drunk on saccharin and methyl
And then you still don't get them that far
Well, that's the new times
That's the new times
That's the new times
Now take it easy there in the early morning
Who arrives but the brethren from the press
If somewhere there lies a cadaver
Or something is foul in the state
You can be sure that a writer is not far behind
With his Excellency I only say:
Hands off the literature
The laurel wreath one gets today
Second hand so to speak
>From the old Empire's stories
Sold underhand at the Alexanderplatz
With all the wigs and costumes
Twitching from the shoulder one is informed
Well, that's the new times
That's the new times
That's the new times
New times. New times. New times.

// Breakin' Up //

There's a crack in my smile 
Dark voices are talking to me 
Dark voices tell me the way 
It's supposed to be 
They said "Breakin' up" 
They said "It's hard to do" 
But what they say 
About breakin' up 
Y'know it's just not true 
Breakin' up, it's easy to do 
Breakin' up, it's easy to do 
Why if you know 
Why did you have to go 
And leave me on t he floor 
About as sick as a dog 
I'm feeding my face 
Like a bleary-eyed hog 
Why'd it have to stop 
With so much good undone 
Breakin' up, it's easy to do 
Y'know I break up every time 
I break up with you

// Key Of 2 //

Well I was sentenced to prison
To do about one year
They said it isn't so bad 
We got a good band here
We play every Wednesday night
Sometimes Tuesday too
It's the music of the future and it will get to you
When I heard the band for the first time
They has no (rhythm). They had no (rhyme)
Well it almost like a dream
I never wanted to have
It drove me (crazy). It drove me (mad)
The man said: "C'mon and play
And here's an instrument for you
It's an ancient flute

It's in the key of 2. Blow..."
I gotta get more time. I gotta stay in here
I used to be foggy
But the music made me clear
Now the jail in rockin' like Elvis never knew
I'm on the inside now. I'm in the key of 2
Now we all are lifers and I'm in the band too
We play my favorite song. It's in the key of 2
And it will get to you
It's the music of the future and it will get to you
And it will get to you
It's the music of the future. It's in the key of 2

// 4 Seasons //

How will I stand the summer when spring was such a bummer?
How will I weather my winter when my fall was such a ballbuster?
It's spring and there'll be no spring fling when my winter was what a winner.
And I am taking a fall 'cause if I ain't got you I got nothing at all.

How will I stand the summer when the spring just made me dumber?
How will I fare my fall -- will I lose my mind in the wintertime?
It's spring and I'm a spring ding-a-ling...
It's summer and I'm just a little dumber...
And I am taking a fall 'cause if I ain't got you I got nothing at all.

Through the four seasons, I'm searching for reasons.

I'm not gonna take the spring 'cause the spring don't mean a thing.
I'm not gonna take the winter 'cause my winter is a splinter.
I'm not gonna take the summer -- summer is such a bummer.
But I am taking the fall 'cause if I ain't got you I got nothing at all.

Through the four seasons, I'm searching for reasons.
Vivaldi, the four Seasons...
It seems to me to be a theme of love with no variations of aggravations.

How will I stand the summer when spring was such a bummer?
How will I fare my fall -- will I lose my mind in the wintertime?
It's spring and I'm a spring ding-a-ling...
It's summer and I'm just a little dumber...
And I am taking a fall 'cause if I ain't got you I got nothing at all.

Through the four seasons, I'm searching for reasons.

Spring, summer, winter and fall...
Spring, summer, winter and fall...
Spring, summer, winter and fall...
If I ain't got you, I got nothing at all.

// Machine //

I got a machine 
And I took over the world 
In one weekend 
I took over the world 
With my machine 
I did it because 
I was looking for a project 
And it was either 
Take over the world or learn French 
So I took over the world 
And next weekend 
I can learn French 
I got a machine 
And I took over the world 
But nothing changed 
That wouldn't be fair

// When Everybody's Happy //

Can you imagine
The world at peace 
What would it be like 
Can you imagine 
Such harmony 
And what will happen 
When everybody's happy 
But me 
Can you imagine 
This headache I have 
Writing this song 
Can you imagine 
The storm inside 
And the quiet 
When everybody's happy 
But me 
I think that I would really 
Like to love 
Give and receive 
I pray that my spirit 
May rise above 
And I'll live a good life 
When everybody's happy 
But me

// Agamemnon //

The telephone, the telephone 
I have an idea 
Women always have ideas 
Hello... 
Here is Agamemnon 
Here is Agamemnon 
Who? Wrong connection 
This is... 
I am a moralist 
An anti-militarist 
I am against duels 
I cannot stand seeing 
A fly in rage 
I cannot look at 
A uniform or blood 
That woman has seduced me 
And now I am done for 
Darling, where shall I 
Hide you in a hurry? 
Here is Agamemnon 
Here is Agamemnon 
I am coming 
Directly from the trenches 
And look forward 
To a solemn luncheon 
Oh, my nerves 
I'm losing my find 
This damned telephone 
Spoils my favorite position 
And no I can start 
Writing poetry again

// This Island Life //

This tea's too strong for me 
As I await your company 
I had too much sun today 
Ocean waters wash away 
Nothing but the present 
Presenting its presence 
This island life 
Separate my right from my wrong 
No I am not pagan 
But my heart has been forsaken 
And the hand of God was on my mind 
It took some time from time to time 
Now in the course I know 
Time itself will go when 
This island life 
Separates my right from my wrong 
You forgot your shoes and I 
I have sent a message but I 
There's so many stars in the sky 
It's the truths that will not lie 
There's a you wild native maiden 
Running mad and barefoot to the sea until 
This island life 
Separates my rights from my wrongs 
This island life 
Finally separates my right from my wrong 
This tea's too strong for me 
As I await more company 
I had too much sun today 
Dram of lands lying far away 
Pregnant with the present 
Presenting its presents 
This island life 
Separate my right from my wrong 
This island life 
Will separate my rights from my songs 
Separate my right from my wrong

// I Saw You In The Crowd //

I saw you in the crowd
I saw you singing out loud
The people were swaying
The band was playing
Something real loud
I couldn't hear one word
Screams were all that I heard
But I saw her face
I saw her eyes
I saw His grace
In the dark'ning skies
I saw you raise your hand
Stretching out to the band
You reach exceeding your grasp
On the beach from the whale
Comes one last gasp
Meet me in my hotel room
Meet me just for fun
And I will not be boring

Some things I been storing
Inside to show someone like you
A few friends just stopped by
I think they wanted to get high
But it wasn't you
Who they led me to
So I bid them all good-bye
I probably would forget
This episode of regret
So I wrote this song
So when you sing along
I hope my message you will get
Meet me in my hotel room
Oh, meet me just for fun
And you will not be boring
Something you been storing
Inside to show someone like me

// Mirror Mirror (I See A Damsel) //

I see a damsel in danger and distress -- I see that she is pretty...
I see a young girl dressed in a dirty dress -- I see that she is pretty...

Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest one of all?
I see a fat girl with her hair a mess -- I see that she is pretty...
I see a proud girl, she's pregnant, I would guess -- I see that she is pretty...

Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest one of all?
Mirror, mirror, do not fail, who deserves to go to jail?
I see the school girls dressed in their Sunday best -- I see that they are pretty...
I see the wagon trains of pioneer women heading west -- I see that they are pretty...

Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest one of all?
Creature, creature, here the plan leads unto the fall of man.
I see a matron unbuttoning a tightly fitting dress -- I see that she is pretty...
I see a maiden, she's careless like all the rest -- I see that she is pretty...

Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest one of all?
Mirror, mirror, do not fail, who deserves to go to jail?
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the prettiest one of all?
Mirror, mirror, humor me, do they see what I see?

// Jesus Of Rio //

Christ the Redeemer towering high over Rio... Rio de Janeiro. Rio... 
Christ the Redeemer towering high over Rio... Rio de Janeiro. Rio... 

Where they held a summit to save the world, and to mark the time when development,
As traditionally understood, had failed, and the affluent North raping the South,
Investment from the North means economic bondage for the South...

Under the burden of debt payments, I was with a whore in Copenhagan,
Drinking eight hundred dollars worth of champagne in kroner...
She came from Rio, we were trying to save the world...
We did not get what we wanted. 
She wanted money... she did not get what she wanted. 
I missed my wife... I did not get what I wanted.

Death sat on my lap. Death sits on all our laps.
While Christ the Redeemer towers high over Rio... Rio de Janeiro. Rio...
