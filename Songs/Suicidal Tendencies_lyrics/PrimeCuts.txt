// I Saw Your Mommy //

[Mike Muir]

Yesterday as I went out of the house
I saw her body lying down as quiet as a mouse
She was lying face down in the sewer
What you do-I got up closer and realized that I knew her
What you see-All her organs coming from her inside
That's nasty-Slashed up skin, sliced-up hide
Tell me some more-I turned her over and saw the tire tracks on her head
Then what-That's when I realized she was dead

Twisted body, chopped-off feet
Her body was minced meat
Bust crawling on her arms
She's dead can't do no harm
Gnarled-up legs, broken and bent
Her last breath has been spent

I wonder how much you had to pay
To get your mom killed in such a bloody way

I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I watched her as she bled
Well she had-Chewed-off toes on her chopped-off feet
Say what?-I took a picture 'cause I thought it was neat
That's cold-But the thing I like seeing the best
What's that-Were the rodents using her hair as a nest
Damn-I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
Say what?-I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead

Twisted body, chopped-off feet
Her body was minced meat
Bust crawling on her arms
She's dead can't do no harm
Gnarled-up legs, broken and bent
Her last breath has been spent

I know it is your allowance that you'll really miss
But make it look good at her funeral and give her little kiss

I saw your mommy and your mommy's dead
I saw her lying in a pool of red-And she don't know how to swim
I think it's the greatest thing I'll ever see-What's that?
Your dead mommy lying in front of me-Ba doo be do
I'll always remember her lying dead on the floor-Ba doo be va
I hope she dies twenty times more

I saw your mommy and your mommy is dead
I saw your mommy and your mommy is dead

Twisted body, chopped-off feet
Her body was minced meat
Bust crawling on her arms
She's dead can't do no harm
Gnarled-up legs, broken and bent
Her last breath has been spent

I wonder how much you had to pay
To get your mom killed in such a bloody way

I saw her, I saw her...mommy

I saw your mommy

// Institutionalized //

Sometimes, I try to do things
And it just doesn't work out the way I want it to
And I get real frustrated
And like, I try hard to do it
And I like, take my time, but it just doesn't work out the way I want it to
It's like I concentrate on it real hard
But it just doesn't work out
And everything I do and everything I try
It never turns out
It's like, I need time to figure these things out
But there's always someone there going
"Hey Mike, you know, we've been noticing you've been having a lot of problems lately, you know?
You should maybe get away
And like, maybe you should talk about it, you'll feel a lot better"
And I go, "No it's okay, you know, I'll figure it out
Just leave me alone, I'll figure it out, you know?
I'm just working on myself"
They go, "Well you know, if you want to talk about it, I'll be here, you know
And you'll probably feel a lot better if you talk about it
So why don't you talk about it?"
I go, "No I don't want to, I'm okay! I'll figure it out myself!"
But they just keep bugging me
They just keep bugging me and it builds up inside

So you're gonna be institutionalized
You'll come out brainwashed with bloodshot eyes
You won't have any say
They'll brainwash you until you see their way

I'm not crazy! (Institution!)
You're the one that's crazy! (Institution!)
You're driving me crazy! (Institution!)
They stick me in an institution
And said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect from the enemy, myself

I was in my room
And I was just like, staring at the walls thinking about everything
But then again, I was thinking about nothing
And then my mom came in, and I didn't even know she was there
She called my name and I didn't hear her
And then she started screaming, "Mike! Mike!"
And I go, "What? What's the matter?"
She goes, "What's the matter with you?"
I go, "There's nothing wrong mom"
She goes, "Don't tell me that, you're on drugs!"
I go, "No mom, I'm not on drugs, I'm okay, I'm just thinking, you know? Why don't you get me a pepsi?"
She goes, "No! You're on drugs!"
I go, "Mom, I'm okay, I'm just thinking"
And she goes, "No! You're not thinking, you're on drugs!
Normal people don't act that way!"
I go, "Mom, just get me a Pepsi, please? All I want's a Pepsi"
And she wouldn't give it to me
All I wanted was a Pepsi
Just one Pepsi
And she wouldn't give it to me
Just a Pepsi!

They give you a white shirt with long sleeves
Tied around your back, you're treated like thieves
Drug you up because they're lazy
It's too much work to help a crazy

I'm not crazy! (Institution!)
You're the one that's crazy! (Institution!)
You're driving me crazy! (Institution!)
They stick me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect from the enemy, myself

I'm sitting in my room, and my mom and my dad came in
They pulled up a chair and they sat down
They go, "Mike, we need to talk to you"
And I go, "Okay, what's the matter?"
They go, "Me and your mom, we've been noticing lately you've been having a lot of problems
And you've been going off for no reason
And we're afraid you're gonna hurt somebody
And we're afraid you're gonna hurt yourself,
So we decided that it would be in your best interest if we put you somewhere you could get the help that you need"
And I go, "Wait! What are you talking about?
We decided?! My best interest?!
How do you know what my best interest is?
How can you say what my best interest is?
What are you trying to say? I'm crazy?!
When I went to your schools
I went to your churches
I went to your institutional learning facilities!
So how can you say I'm crazy?!

They say they're gonna fix my brain
Alleviate my suffering and my pain
But by the time they fix my head
Mentally, I'll be dead

I'm not crazy! (Institution!)
You're the one that's crazy! (Institution!)
You're driving me crazy! (Institution!)
They stick me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect from the enemy, myself

It doesn't matter, I'll probably get hit by a car anyway

I never said I don't like religion, I just don't like TV
You say I got a bad attitude, around you that comes naturally
You say I need more compassion, I can forgive, I just can't forget
You say control my temper, but when I feel like shit, I feel like shit

Cause I was born to be-ST!
And it'll always be-ST!
Don't get down on me-ST!
Cause I'm down OG-ST!

Why can't I ask any questions of what you say is true
Am I supposed to believe anything or just everything said by you?
And how can you call me stupid when you don't understand what I say
And how can you call me evil, have you spoken to God today; and what did He say?

Cause I was born to be-ST!
And it'll always be-ST!
Don't get down on me-ST!
Cause I'm down OG-ST!

Not afraid to die-ST!
Just you promise me-ST!
You got to carry on-ST!
You gotta carry on-ST!

As long as your heart beats...pledge your allegiance!

ST...
ST...
ST...
ST...

You can call me ugly, but I still dress the way I choose
How you gonna judge me; you've never taken a walk in my shoes
Why don't you ever trust me when I'm smiling; is it a sin to have fun?
And why should I repent when there's nothin' wrong with anything that I've done

Cause I was born to be-ST!
It'll always be-ST!
Don't get down on me-ST!
Cause I'm down OG-ST!

Not afraid to die-ST!
You gotta promise me-ST!
You got to carry on-ST!
You gotta carry on-ST!

// How Will I Laugh Tomorrow //

[Mike Clark/Mike Muir]

Here I sit and watch my world come crumbling down
I cry for help but no one's around
Silently screaming as I bang my head against the wall
It seems like no one cares at all

Always an emotion, but how can I explain; how can I explain?
Kind of like the scent of a rose, with words I can't explain, the same with my pain
Caught up in emotion, goes over my head; goes over my head!
Sometimes I got to think to myself is this life or death, am I living or am I dead

The clock keeps ticking, but nothing else seems to change
Problems never solved, just rearranged
And when I think about all the times that I've had
Some were good most were bad

I search for personality and I look for things I cannot see
Love and peace flash through my mind; pain and hate is all I find
Find no hope in nothing new and I never had a dream come true
Lies and hate and agony; through my eyes that's all I see

If I'm gonna cry, will you wipe away my tears?
And if I'm gonna die, Lord please take away my fear
Before I drown in sorrow, I just want to say;
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today

Today today; when I can't even smile today
Today today; when I can't even smile today
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today

You think it's so funny...
...laugh at this!

So when I look outside my room
I see the world, but not the reason
What is done to me is not fair
You call it fair I call it treason
But I don't know what to do
Give me a sign I'll take whatever
But if you want me here I am
Ain't gonna die forever

And I tried to hold ya
But you just turned away
And I tried to tell ya
But not a word I say
I cried out so loudly
But you just covered your ears
And gave me all the signs
That you don't want my tears

So if you want me here I am
I sit and wait your decision
But my body fights my mind
I headed straight for a collision
So am I getting near or am I still
Looking in all the wrong places
But the only thing that seems to change
Are the looks on the faces...

Doesn't anyone...seems like no one cares at all
I search for personality and look for things I cannot see
Does anyone even care at all?
Love and peace flash through my mind; pain and hate is all I find
Seems like no one cares at all
Find no hope in nothing new and I never had a dream come true
Does anyone even care at all?
Lies and hate and agony; through my eyes that's all I see
Seems like no one cares at all

How will I laugh tomorrow?
How will I laugh tomorrow?
How will I laugh tomorrow?
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today

Today today; when I can't even smile today
Today today; when I can't even smile today
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today
How will I laugh tomorrow, when I can't even smile today...

// You Can't Bring Me Down //

[Mike Muir/Rocky George]

What the hell's going on around here?

First off-let's take it from the start
Straight out-can't change what's in my heart
No one-can tear my beliefs apart, you can't bring me

You ain't-never seen no one like me
Prevail-regardless what the cost might be
Power-flows inside of me, you can't bring me

Never-fall as long as I try
Refuse-to be a part of your lie
Even-if it means I die, you can't bring me

You...can't...bring...me...down!

Who the hell you calling crazy? You wouldn't know what crazy was
If Charles Manson was eating fruit loops on your front porch....

Time out-let's get something clear
I speak-more truth than you want to hear
Scapegoat-to cover up your fear, you can't bring me

You ain't-never seen so much might
Fight for-what I know is right
What up-you got yourself a fight, you can't bring me

Stand up-we'll all sing along
Together-ain't nothin' as strong
Won't quit-we ain't in the wrong, you can't bring me

You...can't...bring...me...down!

Bring me down-you can't bring me down!
Bring me down-you can't bring me down, no!
Bring me down-you can't bring me down!
Bring me down-you can't bring me down, you can't bring me down!

Tell them what's up Rocky!

You...can't...bring...me...down!

Bring me down-you can't bring me down!
Bring me down-you can't bring me down, no!
Bring me down-you can't bring me down!
Bring me down-you can't bring me down, you can't bring me down!

So why you trying to bring me?
Well you can't bring me down...No, no, no, no
Can't bring me down....No, no, no, no, no, no
Can't bring me down....No, no, no, no, no, no
Can't bring me down....No, no, no, no, no, no
So why you trying to bring?
Well you can't bring me down

Just cause you don't understand what's going on don't mean it don't make no sense
And just cause you don't like it, don't mean it ain't no good
And let me tell you something;

Before you go taking a walk in my world
You better take a look at the real world
Cause this ain't no Mister Roger's Neighborhood

Can you say "feel like shit"?
Yea maybe sometimes I do feel like shit
I ain't happy 'bout it, but I'd rather feel like shit than be full of shit!

And if I offended you, oh I'm sorry...
But maybe you need to be offended
But here's my apology and one more thing...fuck you!

Cos you...can't...bring...me...down!

Bring me down-you can't bring me down!
Bring me down-you can't bring me down, no!
Bring me down-you can't bring me down!
Bring me down-you can't bring me down!
Bring me down-you can't bring me down, no!
Bring me down-you can't bring me down, no!
Bring me down-you can't bring me down, you can't bring me down!

Can't bring me down!
Can't bring me down!
Can't bring me down!

Suicidal!

// Lovely //

[Mike Muir/Mike Clark/Robert Trujillo]

Lovely, la la la la la la lovely!

Screwed up people everywhere, but I ain't got time to care
I feel lovely, lovely...
Ha! La la lovely, oh-oh...

All kinds of souls down to the curb, but me help? Don't be absurd
I feel lovely, lovely...
La la la lovely, oh-oh...

Cause it's not a problem of society, if...it don't affect me
And I feel lovely, lovely...
As long as I feel lovely, yea...oh so lovely!

And I'm not guilty of your abuse, see it's all self-induced
And I feel lovely, lovely...
Everything's so lovely, la la la lovely, oh-oh...

All your kind are like a pollution, look 'em up quick that's the solution
Lovely! Lovely...
Wouldn't that be lovely? Everything is lovely, oh yea...

So Tipper babe don't you remember me? Now I'm kinder, gentler and so happy
It's lovely, lovely...

La la la...as long as I feel lovely, yea
La la la...and I feel lovely, yea, yea, yea
La la la...and everything is la la la la la la la la la la la la la la lovely

Everything's so lovely, yea
I think I'll throw a party
"Won't you come along darling?"
It's a surprise party for me
Simply because I feel lovely!

If everything's so lovely, yea...then why don't I, why don't I,
Why don't I, why don't I feel lovely?
Lovely, la la la la...lovely, la la la la...lovely, la la la lovely

// Send Me Your Money //

[Mike Muir]

Lights, camera, silence on the set
Tape rolling, 3-2-1 action
Welcome to the Church of Suicidal
We'll have a sermon and a wonderful recital
But before we go on there's something I must mention
An important message I must bring to your attention
I was in meditation and prayer last night
I was awakened by a shining bright light
Overhead a glorious spirit, he gave me a message and you all need to hear it
"Send me your money," that's what he said
He said to "Send me your money"
Now if you can only send a dollar or two
There ain't a hell of a lot I can promise to you
But if you wants to see heaven's door
Make out a check for five hundreds or more
"Send me your money", do you hear what I said?
"Send me your money"

Now give me some bass, um yea that's how he like it
Now let's have some silence, for all you sinners
Now give me more bass, yea that was funky
Now take them on home Brother Clark, send me your money
Here comes another con hiding behind a collar
His only God is the almighty dollar
He ain't no prophet, he ain't no healer
He's just a two bit goddamn money stealer
Send me your money
Send it, you got to send it
Send me your money
You hear what I'm saying?
You got to send it, send it
Send me your money

Now how much you give is your own choice
But to me it is the difference between a Porsche and a Rolls Royce
I want you to make it hurt when you dig into your pocket
Cause it makes me feel so good to watch my profits rocket

Send me your money
Now dig in deep, dig real deep into your pocket
I want you to make it hurt!
We'll take cash, we'll take checks
We'll take credit cards, we'll take jewelry
We'll take your momma's dentures if they got gold in them
So whose gonna be the new king of the fakers
Whose gonna take the place of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker?
See my momma, she didn't raise no fool
Cause you can't put a price on a miracle
Amen

// Nobody Hears //

[Mike Muir/Rocky George]

I talk through my eyes, the words pourin' down
Nobody hears
You ask me what's wrong, but what can I say
Nobody hears

I try to tell you, I try to show you
How else can I tell you, how else can I show you

I'm screaming inside, why can't you hear
Nobody hears
You're looking right through me, like I'm not here
Nobody hears

When the last tear falls down
Nothing gets washed away
Another plea put to rest
As nobody hears, nobody hears

So what did I do to you
That makes you run from me
Now I'm sitting here screaming inside myself
Don't understand why nobody hears

You figured it out, shaped it to your perfection
Nobody hears
Subtracted my feelings from the equation
Nobody hears

Is it all in my mind, all in my mind
Then it would be easy to find, easy to find

When the last tear falls down
Nothing gets washed away
Another plea put to rest
As nobody hears, nobody hears

So what did I do to you
That makes you run from me
Now I'm sitting here screaming inside myself
Don't understand why nobody hears

So if it's all, if it's all in my mind
Then wouldn't it, wouldn't it, wouldn't it be so easy to find

When the last tear falls down
Nothing gets washed away
Another plea put to rest
As nobody hears, nobody hears

So what do I have to do
To make you comfort me
Now I'm sitting here screaming inside myself
Don't understand why nobody hears

So I'm sitting here screaming inside myself
Well I'm sitting here crying inside myself
So I'm sitting here screaming to nobody else
Don't understand why nobody hears
And nobody hears, nobody hears, nobody hears
Nobody hears...

// Gotta Kill Captain Stupid //

[Mike Muir/Mike Clark]

Ah damn, we got a lot of stupid people
Doing a lot of stupid things
Thinking a lot of stupid thoughts
And if you want to see one
Just look in the mirror

Gotta kill Captain Stupid, can't you see him
Today we start the new way, we're Suicidal
Gotta kill the old way, we'll make it better
Won't you join our mission, don't be stupid

Got to kill Captain Stupid
Got to kill Captain Stupid

Brothers killing brothers, what up with that?
Can't you see they're laughing, that ain't funny
Babies making babies, that ain't love
You just got screwed over, get some respect

Got to kill Captain Stupid
Got to kill Captain Stupid
Got to kill Captain Stupid
Got to kill Captain Stupid

Kill him, kill him, kill him
Gotta kill Captain Stupid
Kill him, kill him, kill him
Gotta kill Captain Stupid
Kill him, kill him, kill him
Gotta kill Captain Stupid
Kill him, kill him, kill him

And I don't understand why
People be bringin' Captain Stupid in their lives
Treating him like a superhero
Glorifying him when he ain't nothing but a superpunk
And you see, you're the one who's gonna have to stop him
'Cause you're the one that started him

Oh, what's that?
So now you say life sucks
Well, ninety-nine percent of it's
What you make of it...
So if your life sucks, you suck

What's that crap you're smoking, playing the fool
Waste your life for nothing, when you're something
What the hell you thinking, mind pollution
Got to get back control, it's your life fool

Got to kill Captain Stupid
Got to kill Captain Stupid
Got to kill Captain Stupid
Got to kill Captain Stupid

Kill him, kill him, kill him
Gotta kill Captain Stupid
I gotta, you gotta, I gotta
Gotta kill Captain Stupid
Kill him, kill him, kill him
Gotta kill Captain Stupid
I gotta, you gotta, I gotta
Gotta kill Captain Stupid

What's that now?
Ah, so you're scared to do something about it
Well, you better be scared not to do something about it
Because if you don't kill Captain Stupid
Captain Stupid gonna kill you
Got to kill Captain Stupid...fool

// No Fuck'n Problem //

[Mike Muir/Mike Clark]

You talk your shit, but I ain't listenin'
And I don't do no ass kiss'n
Now here's the point that you've been missin'
No fucking problem at all

Ain't got no fucking problem
I got no fucking problem at all
Ain't got no fucking problem
I got no fucking problem at all

You ain't alive, if you ain't livin'
You waste your life whinin' and snivelin'
So buckle up cause now I'm drivin'
No fucking problem at all

Ain't got no fucking problem
I got no fucking problem at all
Ain't got no fucking problem
I got no fucking problem at all

No fucking problem at all
No fucking problem...

You think you know everything and more
But a surprise you'll be in for
Add it all up and you got no score
No fucking problem at all

You play the part, that I got no use
Don't mean a thing cause you got no juice
I live in a peace, I don't need a truce
No fucking problem at all

No fucking problem at all
No fucking problem at all
No fucking problem at all
No fucking problem...

I got a piece, but not to the puzzle
No time to think staring down a muzzle
I rise above and watch you fizzle
No fucking problem at all

// Join The New Army //

[Louiche Mayorga/Mike Muir]

S.T.!

Listen up real well, I got a story to tell
Pay attention this way to what I've got to say
Took it to the street, rap to the people we meet
We're rocking out hard to the Suicidal beat
Tried to deny our right, so we put up a fight
Just doing our thing, they tried to call it a gang
Saw the way we look, and that's all that it took
All that they wrote, they had their scapegoat

Dressed down...
Homeboyz...
Minority...
Join the Army!

Join the New Army!
The S.T. Army!
Join the New Army!

We're the few, we're the proud, we like to jam it loud
The music we play won't have it any other way
We're armed to the bone with our music and our tone
Recruiting on the street to the sound of our beat
Growing larger every day and every time we play
Don't need no college plan, we're just a hard-rocking band
We like our music to please but we ain't gonna appease
No pressure's too much to make us change our touch

Hardcore...
Punk rock...
The Cyco way...
Join the Army!

Join the New Army!
The S.T. Army!
Join the New Army!

Don't be no fool, don't let your prejudice rule
Don't judge by your fear, judge us by your ear
Can't believe every word of every story you've heard
Just play the song, I know you'll start to rock along
Well I don't care 'bout the clothes you wear
It's the size of your heart, not the length of your hair
Don't make no difference to me, the color that you be
Black, white or brown, it's all the same to me

Join the Army...
Join the Army...
The Suicidal Army!
Join the Army...

Suicidal!

S.T.!

Well if you still don't believe you best get up and leave
Do what you must do, but this ain't the place for you
You got no right but if you start a fight
We'll be rockin' your head but with our fists instead
I'll fight it with the band, right down till the end
Ask anyone I've met, this ain't no idle threat
Don't flap no lip and it won't come to hip
But as for me, I'm down with the Army

New York...
Paris...
Venice...
S.M., Westside...Suicidal!

Join the New Army!
The S.T. Army!
Join the New Army!

// Feeding The Addiction //

[Mike Muir/Mike Clark]

Taste like addiction
Smells like addiction
This is addiction

Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction

You haven't eaten in days and your gums are bleeding
Swearing to God the pipe's all you're needing
It's robbing or stealing or turning a trick
You do whatever it takes to suck on the Devil's dick

The more you feed it, the harder it is to tame
Taking in the Beast, playing it like a game
Lying to yourself saying the same old shit
"I don't need it, I just don't want to quit"

Taste like addiction
Smells like addiction
This is addiction

Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction

The hunger of addiction calls
There's nothing romantic about going through withdrawals
You're craving a sample well, here's just a taste
Picking and scratching the scabs on your face

Your life support system's a syringe
Killing a piece of your soul every time you binge
Praying to God and begging for forgiveness
Knowing damn well that you can't keep going on like this

This is addiction
Feed the addiction
This is addiction

Taste like addiction
Smells like addiction
This is addiction

I won't give up the plot but here's a few surprises
Muscle spasms, you're puking as your temperature rises
Led off to slaughter like a heard of cattle
The demons inside have won the battle

The Devil takes another soul to burn
What does it take for another fool to learn
The ritual's over as another one dies
The ritual begins as another one tries

It's a feeding time...
It's your feeding time
It's a feeding time...
It's your feeding time
It's a feeding time...
It's your feeding time
It's a feeding time...
Feeding...the monster!

Cursing at God and praying to die...
Cursing at God and praying to die...
Cursing at God and begging to die...
Cursing at God and begging to die...

Taste like addiction
Smells like addiction
This is addiction

Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction
Feeding the addiction

Cursing at God and praying to die...

Cursing at God and praying to die...

// I Wasn't Meant To Feel This / Asleep At The Wheel //

[Mike Muir]

What's he saying?

Yeah...just...a little...closer...

What's he doing?

It was, I know, by the corner...yeah
Sitting in the darkness...yeah
I didn't see it, but I know
It tries to hide sometimes, he he he
But it can't fool me...no
Because I had this thing, it's the way I see
The way I see when my eyes are closed
A conception of misconception
It's really quite, shall we say...
The really beautiful thing!
This is certain things that I've come to find
In my communications that never existed
Certain understandings that I've come to realize...yeah
But I don't believe it...no
Not for second!
It wasn't really truthful in the ways that I, that I, that I, that...
They're here right now...yeah

I wasn't meant to feel this...
I wasn't meant to feel this...
I wasn't meant to feel this way

I wasn't meant to feel this...

...

Counting on nothing............Uuuuuuuh...
The numbers get higher.........Ai ai ai ai ai...
Blinded by reason..............Uuuh ah uuuh ah...
You're asleep at the wheel.....Yeeeeeea...

Ai ai ai ai ai ai ai...
Ai ai ai ai ai ai ai...

Confused understanding.........
With a slip...for the hold.....Ai ai ai ai ai...
Squeeze past the pressure......
You're asleep at the wheel.....

A magical moment
Is it...too much of a good thing
Recycled in memory
Was it...too much of a good thing
Why can't you remember
Is it...too much of a good thing
Preserved in its danger
You're all asleep at the wheel...

Blank stare and a whisper, blank stare and a whisper
But who are the judges, who are you judging?
I thought you'd be different, I thought you'd be different
You're all asleep at the wheel, you're asleep at the wheel

A special assignment
Is it...too much of a good thing
Unlocked under pressure
Was it...too much of a good thing
Confined unforgivingness
Is it...too much of a good thing
A new kind of danger
You're all asleep at the wheel...

Ai ai ai ai ai ai ai...
Ai ai ai ai ai ai ai...

Hope in revision...............Uuuuuuuh...
Slight miscalculation..........Ai ai ai ai ai...
It all goes in stages..........Uuuh ah uuuh ah...
You're asleep at the wheel.....Yeeeeeea...

Ai ai ai ai ai ai ai...
Ai ai ai ai ai ai ai...

Ai ai ai ai ai ai ai...
Ai ai ai ai ai ai ai...

A blank stare and a whisper....
I thought you were different...
But who are you judging........
I thought you were different...

You're asleep at the wheel...

// Go Skate! (Possessed To Skate '97) //

[Louiche Mayorga/Mike Muir]

Let's skate!

Seemed like such an innocent toy
He was an All-American boy
Got a skate at eight years old
Now the story can be told

Beware he's possessed to skate!

Skating takes him up in height
He's a pilot on a modern flight
See him flying through the air
Well if he don't land then he don't care

Cause he rips-he rips
When he skates-he skates
He never hesitates...
He's the wizard on the wheels
He's a modern gladiator and he ain't got no fears
So skate!

He shoots the pool like a launching pad
If it ain't insane then you can't get rad
Skating is all that's on his mind
Well he's skating radical all the time

Cause he rips-he rips
When he skates-he skates
He never hesitates...
He's the demon on the wheels
He's like a modern gladiator and he ain't got no fears
So skate!

Possessed to skate!

Looks like a magic carpet ride
Six foot airiels inverts backside
Optical illusion it must be
Well he redefines insanity

Cause he rips-he rips
When he skates-he skates
He never hesitates...
He's the wizard on the wheels
He's a modern gladiator and he ain't got no fears
So skate!

Doesn't understand why you'd wanna walk
Ain't got time to sit and talk
Used to be just like you and me
Now he's an outcast of society

Beware he's possessed to skate!

Possessed to skate!
Possessed to skate!
Possessed to skate!

Possessed to skate!
Possessed to skate!
Possessed to skate!

Possessed to skate!

// Human Guinea Pig //

Lying on my back, wheeled under blinding light
Shackled restraints resist my attempted fight
The scalpels hovers over me, the incision is made
Once again they're watching me, no new sensation, just frustration

They said it was for science
But I'm the human guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig
The guinea pig

My sleep has been altered, I open my eyes
The nightmare continues, I see through their lies
The papers keep turning, the tests never ends
Once again they're watching me, no new sensation, just frustration

They said it was for science
But I feel like the human guinea pig

Time may have passed on, but I won't soon forget
The old sensation, pure frustration of a human guinea, guinea pig
