Album: Crown

// Crown //

Hey, hey you there - where's your crown?
You didn't leave the house without your crown did you?
Just as sure as the earth is round
We bounce back up when they throw us down
So don't forget your crown
And hold your head high
Like you caught a glimpse of God through the clouds
And you stuck in awe
Don't worry we got y'all
Mind and body, body and mind, tell 'em homies
The world is bigger than your street and mine
And that colour and this
And every shade of our skin is rich
Knowing your future depends on our involvement
So, block boys, block boys
It's in our hands more than Parliament
The gun can kill or the gun can save
Rather congratulate a stage than carry him to a grave
That's responsibility
My brother's keeper
My sister's big sister
Life full of lemons we just gotta add a little sugar to
To those sweet dreams
You can be anything
Go farther than me, be better than him, climb higher than her
And never ever let em knock your crown, that's my word
All hands on deck
Making kings and queens of all cards we dealt
Jamla, Roc Nation
Let's go

I lied to mama one time when I was eleven
Riding in the car she told me something I won't forget it
Truth gon' chase the light no matter what night that you said it
It make me feel so low
She peeled my feelings back like lettuce
With no salad told me save all of the carriage for the ballads
Now I'm dropping jewels as if we gave up on the marriage
I know it's hard to handle we ain't came here in no carriage
The hood is for the rain
And where they throw us is the barracks
Where we learn to master beats without a panther or a ferret
It came out in the '80s same as me I was a baby
And what I learned 'bout life is: Lord is sure is not the fairest
If your skin ain't as fair as all the Beckys, Tiffanys, and Sarahs
Black don't crack, Obama ain't flinch
I sat inside that White House having conversations
How boys turn to men if we show 'em more than the rims
If they jumping high for the rims
Ain't a goal that we cannot win
I'm setting picks for you and them I hope you roll off
Million black graduates, woo! Just go and show off
Reaching out to everyone from the top to block y'all
Lemonade pitchers we grew up with, what's a curve ball?
Made something out of nothing
Better out of worse
Take care of your own
I know I gotta do that first
I know there's power in my time
I know there's power in a verse
Tell a kid good job and tell him go hard on the work
You know the world you grew up in is very small compared to Earth
It's the worst they lied and told you your limits on the future
Y'all can brush it off though, came back around and groom ya
Me, Alicia, Talib, Busta, everyone and you ya, agh!
In life there ain't no rules, rule
Whatever you dream you can do, do
They tell me I'm a king!
They tell me I'm a queen!
In life there ain't no rules, rule
Whatever you dream you can do, do
They tell me I'm a king!
They tell me I'm a queen!

// Gonna Miss You //

[Raphael Saadiq:]
Gonna miss you, gonna miss you
Tell me what went wrong
Gonna miss you, gonna miss you
You never came back home
Gonna miss you, gonna miss you
And now you're gone
No one can find you, how could this be?
Please tell me this can't be
True

[Rapsody:]
Sometimes you got to kick rocks
Tired of you always being mad and pissed of, they saying
Now y'all cool I'm at a stage in life like Pablo
Over the handouts, know me I'm sicker
Friends like Bishop
Some days I feel like Draymond when he got tripped up
I ought to go nuts
Dress for success in the platinum gold tux
In the White House singing "we gon' be alright" all night with the POTUS
Yeah, and so I sat down wrote a Hallmark
A couple lines to touch your feelings stared at wall art
Some days I feel like Three Stacks up at that altar
International player like DeRozan I can ball hard
Real friends always pick up where they left off
If I ain't the greatest then I'm somewhere in the ballpark
Yea, catching all the flies
When niggas wanna pop up when you poppin' and wanna ride
Right? Dawg, that's why I seldom join the convoy
I can't share a word if I don't listen to their convo
Then pop, pop, pop
I hit the block and rock them with the combo
A little pop, little rock, little neo soul and Van Gogh yea
Y'all like neighbours with the blinds closed
I see you watching bruh, I'm like Neo when the time froze
Jordan in the iso
Love me I'm your idol
I turn your whole world upside down you look like Wil Myers
It's a stranger thing how Prince left
Still contemplating my next step, they saying
Know when I'mma fly like doves
Y'all cry like doves, you mad cause we don't show y'all love?
"For Us By Us" Solange sing with a shoulder shrug
Becoming a master of not giving a fuck
Somewhere drinking the Reisling up, the season of the cuff
Spoon-feeding y'all the illest is us - JamRoc
Like Tip told Phife, Mos told rap, Kobe told ball
I'mma tell all y'all I'm gonna (miss you)
Like Martin told Tommy
Frank told the tits and punanis look girl
I don't know if he gon'
Like Vine I'm repeating it
That fake beef y'all talking, we don't believe in it
The real you, that is
I don't know who all of you actors is, look homie I'mma
Be happy with yourself first
Can't be coerced in needing leathers and purses
When you price assess worthless, I'mma spit the shit
That baptize the Christians and all the churches
And those who no longer virgins, I'mma

// Tina Turner //

[Public Enemy sample (Rapsody):]
Brothers and sisters (oh my)
Brother and sisters
I don't know what this world is coming to (OooWee)

[Rapsody:]
Snow Hill made a real one
Lot of y'all front on the real 'til the bill come
What it cost to be a boss now? A billion?
Let's put some money together and build it
I did it all with honor the rest of y'all wanna steal shit
I'm sorry homie, we got some different ceilings
Real ones I know don't be catching them kind of feelings
The homies get a lick, we celebrate for their brilliance
But y'all pilgrims, y'all just want to steal shit
I feel like Nat Turner reciting these God verses
I'mma play hard with or without the jersey
I'm misunderstood, yet you love Tiimmy Turner
Back in the kitchen and my wrist still turning, shit
I'm Tina Turner, I need wheels by Germans
All black everything, the color code of purrdy
Show you the beauty of it, meet me in person
The irony of it, you can't afford an excursion
Got love for all my sisters and brothers who rocking turbans
Who don't speakie no Ingles I'm MJ
Pen game better than Pintrest, I'm MJ
Spread my legs to fly, nope ever did that
Ain't a goal too high if you push the rim back
I'm just a chip when this one was a scrimmage
You wrote a whole book, I could kill you with a sentence
Slavery still alive, they just changed it to a sentence
First project in a couple years, I told them I ain't finished
Walking on water and the rest just swimming
Actin' like they don't know me but inside you just timid
Tina Turner, Turner
Tina Turner, Turner

Tina Turner is a goddess
Science can't explain why my flow is so solid
Black women the most educated and graduates from college
5'3" and I'm the tallest and there's no one that could follow
Shade don't phase me, I sleep in a sombrero
Follow the feeling I don't never follow arrows
Made my own path, read a different Bible
Laughed at you niggas celebrating fake titles
I seen more talent at recitals with the babies
I rock clothes that ain't got designer labels
Roc with Jamla, I ain't on Desiigner's label
But my flow been good since April
2010, no matter the cost, I learn from the boss
By next year I won't even need a pen nigga
A plane in the sky couldn't be more fly
Waiting on the day Trayvon killer die, and Ta-Ta
Probly riding round bumpin' this real loud
Cap low with his fist in the sky screaming out
Tina Turner, Turner, Turner
Tina Turner, Turner, Turner

Tina, Tina, Tina Turner
She been working on a burner
Kill everything walking
Bodies all on the corner
Tina, Tina, Tina Turner
She been killing on a burner
Kill everything walking
Bodies all on the corner
Tina Turner, Turner, Turner
Tina Turner, Turner
Tina

// #Goals //

Making short term goals when the weather folds, huh
When I hit a million I'mma still buy fake gold
You seen Stranger Things, the Will in me won't let go
I was born on two-one so eleven is all I know
1 of 1, I got a team to run, I'm Bledsoe
I'm only a Patriot if the flag got a paper plane fold
A circle with Jamla written in script like on scrolls
It's been a while we been bubblin' underground like mould
She got a goal to be married by 25 or 24
Want him to figure it out but if you ask her, she don't know
Long as he got the money money
That's all he need to show
Got a goal to be happy but got 99 totes
You gon' hurt your back carrying them bags like that, that's a quote
Some chicks around my way gold in go to church mode
But she ain't make it, she party hard the night before
Goals goals, goals, goals goals
Know a chick in Atlanta want a body like Teyana
Join a gym but only went 3 or 4 times the whole summer
Everybody got goals but they all got different numbers
Got a mama and her goal is to grow up and then not become her
Know a chick that got a goal to grow her hair down to her stomach
But she bleached it last Sunday and she cut it just Monday
Know a broad at the job that got a goal to be the boss
Yo, she late every day though and she always taking off
Got goals to stack money but she can't, she love to shop
Goals, goals, goals, I ain't never takin' off
Goals, goals, goals, we ain't never takin' off
Goals, goals, goals, they ain't never takin' off
Let's talk about some goals
Let's talk about some goals

You got millionaire goals, self esteem goals, relationship goals
Let's talk about some goals

Making short term goals when the weather folds
Politic and handling business, added some o's
Got to go and pull up in something that makes them go "ooh, shit"
She gotta goal to cover Ebony
In her world it's better and more prestigious than being on Vogue
And maybe Rolling Stone, secondly
I know some girls that just wanna be chose
I know some fly girls, smart girls and some hoes
I know some fly men, smart guys and some hoes
A bruh grew up down the street that only rocked the retros
He got a goal to get drafted into the NBA
Y'all got goals to all graduate with a MBA
You wanna move out your mama crib
Yesterday, to make it home safe was the goal
Cause round her place they been shootin' shootin'
She got a goal to sleep in late, play shooter-shooter
Kids don't ever sleep in late
She got a goal to have a Michael or Prince estate
Her girls all got goals, they hope they marry some ball players
Uh and you just wanna be debt-free
And he just want a job but got a criminal history
Your whole life you been Michael-like with your goals
You and Steph Curry both chasing victory
She got a goal to live rent-free
She said I'mma pimp the system like it's been pimpin' me
Talkin' 'bout some goals

// Mad //

Ooh, they gon' be mad
They gon' be big mad
Tell 'em why you mad son
(Why you always gotta be so mad)

You gettin' on my nerves a bit
Told me one thing I found out that weren't so accurate (mad)
You drove my car, ain't put no gas in it
One on one until you sleepy
But the boys holla you out til 6 nigga, you Dracula (mad)
Oh, oh ok you actin' up
Yea I'm big mad after I vent though I'm good afterwards (mad)
Black love they still attackin' us
Tellin' us how to feel and react
Chill, you ain't as black as us (mad)
Wait a minute watch your tone with me
Don't come for the throne
Remember youngin' you ain't grown as me (mad)
Dot called me for a feature spot
You felt you shoulda been the one so you treat me funny
Now I gotchu (mad)
Like when I'm trippin' and emotional
He mad I read too deep in things and complicate what's simple (mad)
Mo, you mad?
I don't listen like I should at times
Confusin' you with dubs and lames
He said look girl, man man [?]
Some others made we make more money
Your single hot but my whole album hot we make more from it
(Now tell 'em why you're mad son)
Yea tell 'em why you mad son
Cause the boss man's wife's sister's sample is what I'm rapping on?
Jamla is the squad and Roc Nation still the family man
You mad you just a family guy, watching real families man
They mad the First Family love me, President say he a fan
They mad a Black man is the best President that we ever had
(Where'd your love go?) Tell 'em why you mad son
(Where'd your love go?) T-tell 'em why you mad son
(Where'd your love) Tell 'em why you mad son
(Baby, baby, baby) Tell 'em tell 'em
(Why you always gotta be so mad)

Let me tell you why I'm mad son
It's 2016 and Black brothers still harassed dumb
They took The Cosby Show off air son
Bill might be in question but Heathcliff done saved us all, nigga
'Bout some stars and some stripes
Cause some lines bein' crossed and stars sayin' it ain't right now you (mad)
They mad we speakin' super loud now
And money can't buy us, naw, we ain't the type to bow down, ya (mad)
I'mma take a bow now
And y'all can respect every Black and Brown one that wear a crown, ya (mad)
I call my EP Crown, huh
Yo, "who she think she is" is tryna represent for y'all, some (mad)
But y'all ain't secure in your position
Hurt dogs holla, that's some old folks wisdom, niggas (mad)
That we made it through the gate for free
Jay and Khaled ain't the only ones I see that got the keys

// Take It Slow //

[Rapsody:]
Slowly, baby
Take my time to get to know you, baby, baby
Hold me baby
I'll wait however long to hold you baby

Dancing at the party
Don't slow down, hold my body
Hold my hand, whisper in my ear
"Where yo man?" I said I'm single and I'm in college
He said he likes smart girls and that he from the islands
Gave him my number told him "make sure that you dial it"
Watched me as I walked away, you know your girl stylin'
Playing playlists off Tidal
He text me soon after I have to admit I got excited
He asked if I was tired, I waited and sat in silence
I know the code, but I was feeling bold, so I went over
We talked about religion, I'm a witness of Jehova
We talked about sports and all sorts of things on the sofa
The sun was coming up, I took the bed, he took the sofa
I told him take it slow, baby
You'll get to know me
He said I'm worth the wait
He agreed and he would show me that
Slow, slowly

Slowly
Hold you baby
Hold you baby
I'll wait however long to hold you baby, baby

[Rapsody & D.R.A.M. sample:]
It's the vibe, it's the vibe
It's the vibe, it's the vibe, vibe
It's the vibe, it's the vibe, vibe
It's the vibe, it's the vibe, vibe
It's the vibe, it's the vibe
It's the vibe, it's the vibe, vibe
It's the vibe, it's the vibe
It's the vibe, it's the vibe
It's the vibe, it's the vibe
Cause I really wanna show you somethin'
And I just wanna impress you darling
And I just wanna make you feel good
So is you with me

[Rapsody & D.R.A.M. sample:]
What up boy? Oh ok, oh, you into retros? I got those
I got the 8's and 11's and, I mean, I mean whatever impress you
I mean, I'm just sayin'
I just wanna impress you, I got tickets to the game
And a shirt with your favorite team
I mean more than the rest do
I bought this new fit cause I want this night to feel special
And I paid the most for Uber, the black truck
Look hun, I just wanted to impress you
We can kick it, chill, it ain't gotta get sexual
I ain't the type to give it up fast
If you respect that then I'm sure it will impress you
To know I like you and I just wanna impress you darling
I know all the words to Prince too
I take my feelings back if you say that don't impress you
I like it that you hold conversations, that's intellectual
And you don't take yourself too serious, that's impressive too
And I just wanna impress you darling
And I just wanna make you feel good
So is you with me
And I just wanna impress you darling
And I just wanna make you feel good
So is you with me
It's important we communicate
Wait, I wanna impress you, I got the grapes
Wait, I wanna impress you, I got the 8's
You ain't just a regular friend to me as of late
And before I been feeling this way since MySpace
And I ain't like none of them other girls you used to date
You laughing but I wasn't impressed with your bad taste
I'm being honest, look I saved you ok?
Look I was hoping maybe you would try with me when
Bruh bruh split
Or maybe you ain't like I was a tomboy then, hmm
Or maybe you ain't think I was as pretty as them
Now you like maybe I shoulda came and said something back then, true
And I just wanna impress you darling
So what you like, the movies or walks?
A lit restaurant or home cooking at all?
A comedy show joyride or somethin' else special?
Look baby boy, I'm just tryna impress you
And I just wanna impress you darling
And I just wanna make you feel good
So is you with me
And I just wanna impress you darling
And I just wanna make feel good
So is you with me

// Through With Him //

[Sample - Dionne Warwick:]
I can't wait until I see my
My baby's face when I tell him that I'm through

[Rapsody:]
He don't think I know his move
That he leave the house everyday between 1PM and 2
I notice every time she call he leave the room
The volume on his phone up and I know it ain't no dude, nigga
I know the signs I've been around a block or two
My mama and my aunties and my grandma gave me jewels, nigga
I had my homegirls watching when you made your move
They followed you around the town and even sent me pictures too, you stupid
When I pull up in that black thing and you lie like prove it
I'ma show you date and time, every new receipt, every movie
I'm a OG, you a fucking student
Your boys are even looking at you like you fucking stupid
They probably told you "don't be out here flossing her so loosely"
They probably told you I'm a good thing and better not lose me
Got me sitting in the rain while ya'll sip on D'UssÃ©
When you turn that corner with her, whew boy that's gon' be a doozy
I should have known, your baby momma called she told me truth
She said you called your son and told him he weren't yours and that you're moving
Uh, that's some pussy shit, punk shit
Have you up in county nigga laying on top bunk shit
While I'm sipping on this Sunkist
Laughing at you running around thinking that you run shit
Yeah I'mma let you have your fun shit
But you don't know she got a boyfriend, he be on that gun shit

[Jay-Z sample:]
Ok I'm reloaded

[Martin Lawrence stand up sample:]
Go in the closet, put on your "fuck him" dress
Go to the club
Fuck him girl

[Rapsody:]
Ain't no putting up with that
Y'all ain't talked since yesterday
He said he would call you back, I mean shit (Fuck him girl)
He ain't go no job yet, you ain't met his mama and they live together, how's that?
Naw girl (Fuck him girl)
Oh, you went and read his texts
He's still talking to old girl
He say they just friends
Naw come on, she want to (Fuck him girl)
Love, he got an attitude, look
This what you gon' do
The next time that he touch you
You just don't (Fuck him girl)
He don't help you with the bills
Eat your food, and drive your car
And never tells you where he is, hell naw (Fuck him girl)
Oh you know he got a daughter
What would you tell her if she ever came to you with problems
He said (Fuck him girl)
But on the flip if he a good one
And he's fine, never lying
Then girl you better run home and (Fuck him girl)
Cause these tricks they be lying
I see 'em when we walking
Looking at my man, I know they wanna (Fuck him girl)

Fuck that nigga
Fuck him girl
Fuck him, fuck his mama
Fuck his sister
I should have fucked his nigga
Who tried to come at me
Fuck him
He was a fuck nigga from the beginning
He ain't have no money
His friend's dick was probably bigger anyways
Should have never fucked with that fuck ass nigga
When I pulled up on him with that bitch at his mama's house
I should have beat her ass
Fuck that bitch
I should have listened to his mama
When she told me he was a fuck nigga
Just like his daddy, another fuck nigga
That shit run in the genes
Nigga was broke anyway
Had to lend that nigga money too many fucking times
Still ain't got all my shit back
Fuck that nigga
(Fuck him girl)

// 2 AM //

[Rapsody:]
Backrubs on backbones and black booty
Ain't nothing else popping out here at 2AM
If it ain't good intentions niggas out looking for food
Or end up in intensive, down in county zoos

I couldn't count on you yesterday nigga, where you was?
Everybody ain't family just because they call you cause
I know a few used to beens and some that never was
And I ain't have to grow up in streets, I know it well enough
Growin' up with homies that grew up in it, fell for some
Sometime after whoop, there it is for some
Just learning to hoop some, look son ain't no unsinging
I mean I'll never be an unsung
My uncle had bad lungs and I hope my brother learned something
And he just tell me we gon' die from something anyway
But my motto ain't no need to speed it up none
But my niggas like anyway

Backrubs on backbones and black booty
Ain't nothing else popping out here at 2AM
If it ain't good intentions niggas out looking for food
Or end up in intensive, down in county zoos

[Ab-Soul:]
You know the freaks come out at night
How am I so bright but my eyes so sensitive to the light
That's a balance you'll never understand in your life
It's like you never play Jenga or Life in your life
Or like you never met a nigga that got life in your life
I'm sacrilegious making sacrifices, ain't I Christ?
I tried to tell Lo God, everybody got talent it's just what you do with it that matters
That's coming from one who in acquiring skills saw his words would eventually cut deeper than Skilsaws
See music is the king of all professions, that's partially
Cause even at crossroads it can bring Bone-Thugz-N-Harmony
Hip is to be intelligent, hop is for the movement
In other words if you ain't riding you stupid
We spreading like germs all over the whole earth
I propose to you a purpose for your own birth
To let your soul glow all over the universe y'all
Get it? We united by verses, all
Protons, neutrons, and electron, that's all

[Rapsody:]
Backrubs on backbones and black booty

I couldn't count on you yesterday nigga, where you was?
Everybody ain't family just because they call you cause
I know a few used to beens and some that never was
And I ain't have to grow up in streets, I know it well enough
Marcus Mariota, came in with wings on my shoulder
Where I'm standing the grass the same green all over
Ain't gotta throw the skin cause the lines don't flinch
Heartless in this department, I ain't changed a cent
I don't count on y'all the same, math problems
The more I add, the more I lose, math problems
If my lane ain't like Problem's with all diamonds
I know the pressure gon' bust more than water columns
Y'all blow pipes like Whitney out this motherfucker
Singing my business to my other nigga's other niggas
Imagine if Ricky had a gun out this motherfucker
There woulda been a lot less blood in the street, get it?
I heard a ho nigga a ho nigga that talk, nigga
Like he know niggas, no no nigga, I know niggas
I know common niggas act common, but I know Common
This bitch in you well all see, yea I'm so honest
Come around talking big game, you ain't Torry homie
I don't drive pickup but I do dodge rams
This really all wolves all clothed as lambs
I'm really superhuman, y'all just pose like Cam
Putting broads on the 'Gram get out my business, damn nigga
Don't like pigs, my mouth ain't even ham nigga
Know how to handle y'all, call me Shammgod nigga
Know the game and when and how to bounce quick
Cause I don't stick with those I suppose I don't trust
Mama taught me right from wrong, be aware of your clique
So I guess I gotta switch up my faculty quick
I see error in your ways, ain't no future with it

2AM the whole block up
Wanna be alone tonight, I pray no one no pop up
Chillin', some days I don't feel like comin' out my taco, shell
I know niggas who got goals like soccer who ain't doin' well
Living through me yellin' "throw the Roc up!"
Instead of watching news, the days events, they never shock us
Know niggas around my way playing tata and chocolate droppas
Your feelings spillin' over, hope there's someone there to mop up
Wanna let me ego go on you niggas
I'll be modest, I'll be hottest, I won't hide it
Call the kettle what the pot is, I'm black and proudest of that
Yea I made it from the bottom
Like I stood in line for hours for Jordans and they ain't got 'em
I been disappointed
Took it and this the point
Some of you rappers corny
I know we all just fornicating there's no debating my rating
Should be way up there with Lauryn's
If you colour me bad make sure the colour you use is orange
I'm a Frank Ocean; a realist
Only rock with the people that got that real in 'em
Carolina, what up? You know I'm still with 'em
If they ain't rockin' like this then we don't deal with 'em
Hey, uh
Only rock with the people that got that real in 'em
Carolina, what up? You know I'm still with 'em
If they ain't rockin' like this then we don't deal with 'em
Hey, uh

// Fire //

Maybe we should love somebody
Yep yep
Joy come in the morning
The sun rise tomorrow no matter how dark the night gets
You feel me right?

We gon' still be alright
Joy come in the morning, we just gotta last for a night
The mask came off tonight
Don't matter who in the Big House
We gon' still march and fight, word to my people! Whaddup!
My brothers still standing strong holding dey nutz
Sistaaaaahs! We built tough right? Right
It's super heavy though to think about these bodies
'Tween the sheets Ron Isley wasn't singin' 'bout
I know the disbelief and pain that we all feeling now
Why some feel the need to wanna burn it down
It's understood
Ain't no fear in my heart! I only fear God!
Feel like Beast Mode with the ball
World on our back but we still gon' go super hard for you all
Right? Right
Do it for the children, I got some things on my soul!
On my soul
Another hashtag in the streets, motherfuck it all
Don't invest your money in a business that don't fuck with y'all
Look the babies in the eye and tell 'em "We'll do better"
Yesterday is over, but tomorrow still waiting for us all
Yea sing that, sing that loud, how it go?
What it feel like?

Walk through the fire
All my people growing tired
Mamas fighting with they babies
They the ones to start the revolution, shit crazy
The media portray me with lies
Wanna justify how my Black folk died
They don't want hear our cries
So we set that motherfucker on fire

Crispus Attucks
They drug us through the system, America like an addict
Abuse the power I can show you a real savage
Being peaceful nowadays a little below average
I pride myself in being exceptionally well at it
We'll play it like y'all play and let our children throw tantrums
We hear the media telling you all to fear us
They never took a day off from killing us like Ferris
All day circus, they spinning shit like Ferris
We gotta bigger wheel, our will to live is apparent
Just ask a parent
We're living in America but ain't paying the same rent
We need progress and they still talking past tense
Where we going now? Ain't no need in backing down from shit
(What is feel like?)
Walking through the fire, all my people growing tired
Mamas fighting with they babies
They the ones to start the revolution, shit crazy
The media portray me with lies
Wanna justify how my Black folk died
They don't want hear our cries
So we set that motherfucker on fire

Walking through the fire (burn that bitch down)
All my people growing tired (we tired bruh)
Mamas fighting with they babies (we tired bruh)
They the ones to start the revolution, shit crazy
It's crazy out here (losing our minds)

Hard to get a grasp on how I feel
