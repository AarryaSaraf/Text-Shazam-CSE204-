[Guilty:]

You can blame me for a lot of wrongs that I've done here
Checking your phone wondering who has called here
And when you gone, I be wondering who you chilling with
Insecurities steam emotions from past relationships
Highly insecure when all ever you do fill me with
Compliments of how no one touching me on this continent
Guess I need to trust you more, fucking find me some confidence
So I be silent
Arguing or faking it, thinking its on some hating shit
Really I'm just passionate hoping you know you mean a bit
Lot to me, Lottery of all the a million picture number one, know I be tripping but where its coming from
I did hard, told myself nothing like that you play smart
And what I do,
Oh heart! Save me I'm guilty of being in love
I miss us
Guilty of doing things for attention
Social networks, I be wondering who you friending
Call your guy friends who drafting 'bout your interests
Checking his story, I'm making sure that the end is the same
And what you told me last night ain't been changed
I'm guilty, of loving you dangerously I put you through this bullshit
I'm sorry, don't wanna lose you like Harley lost Azea
I pray, forgive me my despair
What I have broken may we repair

// All Black Everything //

Yeah
Eric, your a real live G for this one
Yo

All black everything, all black you know
All black in the name of all my black heroes
All black everything, all black polos
All black medallions, yeah, all black you know
Say

All black everything, polo and socks
Symbolize we not defeated by them system and cops
Word to 9th, and that all black leather I wear
Coatin my skin, I'm all black just like a pair of mcnair
Family wore the warm blacks, yo, resemble my hair
They brush it off, pardon them all, they got no reason to care
All T's, all black, cause at the top is Barack
In a stack of all black jeans cause I'm never gon slack
Black boy shorts on my ass, like teachers stay on short black boys in class, so they grow to lead the masses
Black sunglasses cause my future bright, Molasses
Blackberry, write my rhymes in them every night, they scary
Black scarves, they represent scars and nooses they hung us by
But now they hangin on my word, dueces
Yo, too black to not be a fan of Michael Jack
Word the bible colors all black
Just like my scully cap, cause blacks be on my mind

All black everything, all black you know
All black in the name of all my black heroes
All black everything, all black polos
All black medallions, yeah, all black you know
Say

All black belts for all the blacks that didn't buckle
In the stuggle, Black medallions medalin they didn't love us
Crosses burning in our yards, Black bangers for the wrists
Up on the wrist I told them this
Black friday in the black
Just like a prophet I would profit
To the black's worth
To the blackness of my bra
Gon support you
Word, to Phylicia Rashad's black lashes,
All blacks they used to make up all the back of buses
I wear liner on the lids for all my brothers
And the mothers, black picks we stay ahead of dissin black
My bookbag be dippin cause rapsody has got your back
Blacks they be hypin, I'm the light that lit your match
A black watch for all the times I watched MTV raps
Black lights and blues burn when I record for watts
And every black like Troy Davis who never had a fair shot
All black everything, everything black
Culture over everything, yo, we taking it back
Black

All black you know
All black in the name of all my black heroes
All black everything, all black polos
All black medallions, yeah, all black you know
Say
All black everything, all black you know

// Rock The Bells //

Here comes a change and another change
And another change and another wave of change
Like a heartbeat coming from another world

[Rapsody:]
I burn, bush on Sinai
None higher than I
Roll up, like that good kush that they've been smokin' since 5
Pull out like 2 9's and I aim it dead at they eyes
And tell them lyrically motherfucker you have met your demise
Jedi, the black chapter
Like the bone in they thigh been hip to the game niggas lame
I am July working my fire
Know to fucking light up the sky
UFO with the flow, I'm like that alien guy
ET, high power, I three, I see
With it, lyrically niggas never touching us sick
A cell, hard to pass me, I'm too cold they ain't well
I gel, with black hippie Mon√°e Janelle
A droid, roid, hemmed in they pit, niggas smell
The shit coming through, silver-back monkey at zoo
Bananas, I've been really forreally like a milli leroux
East side, now show respect cause the west coming through
It's like lyrically Big and Pac, man if they friendship was cool
Motherfucking jams we making until the skies turn blue
My view is by Badu sitting at window seats
Lookin' down, word to Nate Dogg, and all dog pounds they he peep
We high, touching the sky now and the rest of 'em sheep
I'm that ba-ba black one now standing out in the heap
Buh-baa, but brag, I part rappers, fingers on Chad
From the rad and so-so's I top, most niggas that lag
Behind, never they catch up like the britches they sag
Close to fallin' off, I'm in front I'm the jag on the jag
Catch up, catch us, good luck like clover niggas now gag
Throw up your 3 for K-dot, now wave 'em repping the flag
Jamla, camera, I snap like ginger cookies, a monster with stanzas
Stand us, they can't Walker Texas, I'm rangers at ranches
Out of their ranges
Kickin shit up now these niggas can't stand up
Sit down I'm too fuckin' profound, I'm rap Diddy to strangers, I'm gone

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Look into the new vision in mind
Kendrick divine intervention, I drop a jewel and the diamonds glisten
Don't chime in my business you'll run into atomic collision
You knew my colonic was different
I'm shitting on shit that was shifting your image
I rhyme like a chemist
I rhyme like the Guinness book of records was records I written
I rhyme and you mimic the rhyme that I didn't like when I did it
You bit it
Your bite is so big you need bridges at night, and 9th can admit it
The pint that Hennessy spiked this minute a mic and a menace
And time is dependent on what you pretending to be
Your grind is diminished by me and mine is the menace the preach
I'm findin my soul on this beat definin' my flow
And you know I fold any foe at defeat its 4 in the morning
Formin a George Foreman that's a grill when I speak and I'm on it
Till the mill in the jeep then living orders
I feel like feets of the fortune of gorgeous of bitches I see when recordin sheesh
