Album: FireItUp

// Fire It Up //

[Chorus:]
(We want Rick to funk us up.)
(We want Rick to funk us up.)

Hey
Yeah, yeah
Hey

(Hey everyone, tonight we're gonna have fun.)
What you want us to do with the funk?
(Fire it up.)
(Hey everyone, tonight we're gonna have fun.)
What do you want us to do with the funk?
(Fire it up.)

If funky music makes you groove
And you just can't wait to move
And getting off is what you've come here for
Then there's no need to hesitate
Cause you know I hate to wait
I'll funk you til' you roll on out the door.

[Chorus]

(So wave the funk sign in the air.)
And show me that you care
You've been sitting on your booty much too long
(We'll funk you, but don't go nowhere.)
If you say it's fun
Then fire up cause the show has just begun

(Hey everyone tonight we're gonna have fun.)
What you want us to do with the funk?
(Fire it up.)
Hey everyone tonight we're gonna have fun.)
What you want us to do with the funk?
(Fire it up)
Blow
(Hey......)

Now don't just sit there in your chairs
Actin' like L-seven squares
Freak on out, that's what this song's about
(Funk is for the young and old)
I know you have been told

Don't ever get too hip to sing and shout now
I haven't come to bring you down
Or to turn your head around
Or to tell you what you should or should not do
(Funk was made to get you high.)

That's no alibi
Do what you want, it's all left up to you
Yeah
(Hey everyone tonight we're gonna have fun.)
What you want us to do with the funk?
(Fire it up.)

(Hey everyone tonight we're gonna have fun.)
What you want us to do with the funk?
(Fire it up.)
(People get up and dance to the music.)
(People get up.)
(People get up.)
(People get up.)
(People get up and dance to the music.)
(People get up.)
(People get up.)
(People get up.)
(Hey......)
Yeah
(Hey......)
What you want us to do with the funk?
(Fire it up.)
What you want us to do with the funk?
(Fire it up.)
Say fire it up
(Fire it up.)
Say fire it up
(Fire it up.)
Say fire it up
(Fire it up.)
Fire it up.

// Love In The Night //

Woke up this morning, the sign of loneliness had left my face
In its place, peaceful contentment
Seemed to caress me, as I watched you sleep
So beautiful you made me weep
Just yesterday we were strangers babe
Meeting each other in nighttime charades
You with a glance, I with romance
And together, we took a chance baby, yeah
We made love in the night
We made love in the night
Love in the night
If you want me say yeah, yeah
If you want me say yeah, yeah
Anger and madness, that's how I felt before I met you, dear
In my heart there was fear, oh, don't get me wrong now

They're many, many girls I have let use my bed
Take my heart and my head

Oh what's the use girl you're fast asleep
You can't hear me or see me, so what does it mean?
Is there a trace of a tear on your face
Could it truly be
You've been listenin' to me, yeah, baby

Let's make love in the night
Love in the nighttime is the right time for you baby

Love in the night
If you want me say yeah yeah
If you want me say yeah yeah
yeah baby

Love in the night
Baby, baby let's make love in the night
If it's good to you mama keep on talkin', say
Love in the nighttime is the right time for makin'
Love in the night
Love in the night
Love in the night, if it's good to you baby
[Chorus]
(Love), Hear me talkin' to you people
(Love), Makin' love is gonna be so fine
Sing
Everybody make love
Everybody every single body
Let's make love yeah, yeah

People sing it, yeah yeah

When it feels lonely baby
(Let's make love)
Makin' love is better than war

(C - O - M - E)

// Stormy Love //

Today my love is like a raging storm
The emptiness surrounds me, and I am torn and lost
Within the realm that you are gone
Drowning am I in a pool of tears
To think that for years to come
I must live alone without you
The only one I've ever loved
And in the night my heart must reminisce
And I savor each memory of you
Like a fine wine
It is said that time will heal the wounds of all men
As for me there is no time and no cure
For the love you gave was pure
Until this day the gods have not forgiven me for betraying you
And you, do you lie awake at night with thoughts of me in your head?
Is there another lover, a stranger beside you in your bed?
To take the place of me
These words and thoughts from me to you
Will come and go in space and time
And I'll never forget that once you were mine
If saying come back will bring you here
I'd say come back my dear
As for now my love is like a storm today

// When Love Is Gone //

Girl you're old enough to know the way your life should be
Why then do you always ask your mother and me?
Chances are our future's are over said and done
The battle now is over and the war I have won
Think that over
While you're lying in your sleep at night
You and me we could have made it baby, baby
But you walked out of my life

Now my love is gone
Now my love is gone
Now my love is gone
Now my love is gone

Girl, I see no further reason for me to carry on
This will be the last time I write to you in song
My heart's an open secret your love has closed the door
It's over
Like the time that's passed away til' now
How much longer will I suffer baby, baby
Must I bear this pain and smile

Now my love is gone, gone, gone, gone
It's gonna be hard to carry on
Look at me baby
Haven't you ever seen a grown man cry
Don't it look funny, sugar
Watchin' tears fall from his eyes
Yes indeed I cry, cry

[Chorus]
(When your love is gone)
(When your love is gone)
[It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone)
(it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone)
I When your love is gone)
(When your love is gone)
(It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone)'
(It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone)
(When your love is gone)
(When your love is gone)
(It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone)
(It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone)
Girl, to see my life without you is more than I can stand
Picture me an empty hollow shell of a man
Caged within, a feelin' that one day you'll return
Knowing that can never be, my flesh starts to burn
Don't you care baby?
Don't you even feel the pain and hurt
I'm goin' through
If you really, really, really cared baby, baby
You'd know what I'm goin' through

Now my love is gone
Gonna be so hard to carry on
Look at me baby
Haven't you ever seen a grown man cry?
Don't it look funny sugarÂ ?

Watchin' tears fall from his eyes
Won't you tell me why
Oh why
Oh why
Oh why has it gone
