// Money Talks //

When you're out walkin'
and money's talkin'
Just stop and listen
to what's it's sayin'

Don't need a dollar
to be a scholar
Drop all your money
and don't you holler

When you hold the cash
and the dough
and those greenback dollars go
Money's walkin', money's walkin'

People need to eat
To put shoes
on their little baby's feet
That's money talkin', yeah


yeay yeah yeah
Oh Yeah
Money Talkin
yeay yeah yeah
Oh Yeah

Ronnie ran for President
Because he wants to control
where the money's spent

What about the war and destitute
Well, they don't matter
They do not compute

What about the blacks
and the whites
and the reds are so uptight
Cause money's walkin', money's walkin'

Taxes rising high
Till my cup
Is so empty I could cry
Money's talkin', yeah

yeay yeah yeah
Oh Yeah
Money Talkin'
yeay yeah yeah
Oh Yeah

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Money talk
Money, money
I say yeah
Money talk
Money, money
I said yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Money talk
Money, money
I say yeah
Money talk
Money, money

Money talkin' loud and clear
in my ear

She works the corner
of Twelfth and Vine
Making her tax free money
pinching every dime

She has to hustle
to make ends meet
Even a workin' lady
finds it hard to eat

What will be the deal
in the end
if to live we've got to steal
But the money's walkin', money's walkin'

Ronnie find the cure
this is just too much for us to endure
That's freakin' talkin', yeah

// Teardrops //

(Teardrops are falling from your eyes
Teardrops are falling, teardrops are falling
Teardrops are falling from your eyes
Teardrops are falling, teardrops are falling)

A teardrop fell from my eyes yesterday
Letting me know I was not to be to cry
Although I asked the girl "please go away"
Should I be a man and just apologize?

I was all so wrong (baby, you were so wrong)
Hiding my foolish pride (hiding behind your pride)
Over and over again

Now the teardrops are falling (falling, falling, falling)
They are falling
Now my girl is gone away
Teardrops are falling (falling, falling, falling)
They are falling
But my girl is gone to stay

A teardrop fell from my eyes yesterday
Suddenly there was an emptiness inside
To lose a precious love like yours that way
And feeling such pain that brought teardrops to my eyes

I was all so wrong (baby, you were so wrong)
Hiding behind my foolish pride (hiding behind your pride)
Over and over again

Now the teardrops are falling (falling, falling, falling)
They are falling
Cause my girl is gone away
Teardrops are falling (falling, falling, falling)
They are falling
Cause my girl is gone to stay

Blow baby
Blow Danny

You know it takes a very, very special kind of man
To admit to his woman that he's been wrong
I've lost many ladies in my life
And through losing I've learned one thing
That you must be honest with the one you love

When you lose the one you love
And the teardrops start to fall
Don't hesitate or even wait
Say you love her, thinking of her
Give the one you love, your all in all
All and in all, all in all
Give her all the love you've got

(Teardrops are falling from your eyes
Teardrops are falling, teardrops are falling
Falling...)

// Standing On The Top //

Yi yi yi, yi yi yi yi

When you're on the top
There's no place
You can really go
But down, down, down

People on the street
Congratulate you
They say they love the way
You sound, well

When you're on the low
No one wants to chit or chat
Or even know your name

Your agent's never there
Your manager has ripped you off
And gone somewhere
Standing on the top

Standin' on the top, top
On the top gettin' down, yeah
Standin' on the top, yeah, top
On the top gettin' down

[Temptations sing:]
Standin' on the top
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Standin' on the top
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

When you're on the top
Everyone you meet they
Wanna be your
Long lost friend

They say how great you are
A superstar but do you
Have any money to lend
(Hey, man, can you loan me a few bucks?)

When you're on the low
Where do all the freaks
And fancy people go
I don't know
(I don't know)

People sit and stare
Askin' crazy questions
Do you braid your hair
(And what's L-7 Square)

Standin' on the top, top
On the top gettin' down, yeah
Standin' on the top, top
On the top gettin' down, ho

Standin' on the top, top
On the top gettin' down, yeah
Standin' on the top, top
On the top gettin' down
Down, down, down

We understand it
Can you understand it
What I'm talkin' about
When I say that funk
Is here to stay

We understand it
If you understand it
Sing it, yeah, yeah

We understand it
When I say that funk
Is here to stay
Funk is here to stay

We want the funk
We want the funk
And nothin' else will do
Nothin' else will do, no

We want the funk
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We want it back
Nothin' but the punk funk

We want the funk, ooh
We want the funk
And nothin' but the funk

We want the funk
(We want the funk)
I was sayin' that
We want the funk

We want the funk
We want the funk
And nothin' else
But the funk will do
We want the funk
And nothin' else will do

We want the funk
We want the funk
And nothin' else will do
We want the funk
And nothin' else will do

We want the funk
We want the funk
And nothin' else will do
We want the funk
And nothin' else will do...

// Happy //

Lady, I can understand your problems and your worries
When you love a man like me
And if you donât mind I will try to say âI love youâ in this song now
Listen to this melody

You belong to me
I belong to you, yes, I do
And we belong to each other, lady
Listen to me, baby

Thereâll be times when Iâll be down and Iâll be troubled
Trying to be that rising star
But donât worry, I will never in our lifetime bust your bubble
Or bring you down from where you are

Youâre a queen to me
And Lord knows Iâm a king to you, yeah
And we belong to each other, baby
Yeah

You go to my head
Youâre a part of everything I say and do
You go to my head
And you keep me happy

Ooh, baby, I can understand your worries and your problems
Trying to be a rising star
And if youâre lonely all you have to do is call my name out
And Iâll be there where you are

You belong to me
Lord knows I belong to you
And we belong to each other, baby
Yeah

You go to my head
Baby, youâre a part of everything I say and think and do
(You go to my head)
Every time we make love on the bed you go to my head
And Iâm givinâ all my love to you
You go to my head, baby (Ooh...)

Can I bring it down and talk to you awhile
Can I talk to you (Ooh...), woman, can I talk to you
(Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...ah)
Can I talk to you, baby

{You keep me happy} When weâre makinâ love under stars aglow
{You keep me happy}
{You keep me happy} Kissing you all over from your head to your toes (Ooh...)
{You keep me happy} Caressing you, touching you (Ooh...ooh...ooh...)
Kissinâ every little part of you (Ooh...ooh...)
{You keep me happy}
{You keep me happy} When Iâm lovinâ you and I (Mmm, hmm)
{You keep me happy} With my arms around you squeezinâ you tight
(Mmm, hmm, mmm, mmm)
{You keep me happy} When we do all the things that only you and I can see (Mmm)
{You keep me happy} You go from the bottom of my toes to the top of my head
(You go from the bottom of my toes to the top of my head)
{You keep me happy} You keep me happy

// She Blew My Mind (69 Times) //

Just like the fool I went and stayed too long
I never listen to your tender song
My only wish to was just to satisfy
And keep you happy till the day I die

You got hung up that night we made love
And when your cried what were you thinking of?
I kiss the tears and fears off your face
That's when you let another take my place, yeah!

You turn my head around
Turn me upside down
You turn my head around
Blew my mind... 69 times
Yeah...

Why you want to go and break my heart? Yeah!
Just like a child you had to have your cake
Playing with me that was your first mistake
There are too many cakes and pies to taste
You are the one I did not want to waste
Just like a baby acting insecure
When all the time I thought that you were sure
You are the twinkle turn into a star
Just this time little girl, you've gone to far, yeah!

You turn my head around
Turn me upside down
You turn my head around
Blew my mind... 69 times

// My Love //

Turn the lights off
Woman come to my bed
Lay beside me, rest your beautiful head
No need for you to feel alone
Now that you're in my home, my love

Don't be nervous
And girl don't be shy
I won't love you and then say goodbye
There's no need for you to resist
Now that we have kissed, my love

Feel the fire
Feel the flame as it grows
Where we will burn too
Only heaven knows
There's no need for you to be alone
Now that you are in my home, my love
My love
