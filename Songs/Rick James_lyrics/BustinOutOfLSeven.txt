// Bustin' Out (On Funk) //

Well all right you squares it's time you smoked
Fire up this funk and let's have a toke
It'll make you dance and some of everything
Everybody get high, sing

Bustin' out
Bustin' out
Bustin' out
Bustin' out
Bustin' out

We're bustin' out of this L seven square
Freaks like you and I could never funk from there
We're bustin' out, everybody come along
We're gonna dance on the funk and make love on this song
We're bustin' out and if everyone agrees
Put your hands in the air and sing along with me

We're bustin' out on the funk
We're bustin' out on some serious funk, y'all
We're bustin' out on the funk
We're bustin' out on some serious funk, y'all

Bustin' out
Bustin' out
Bustin' out
Bustin' out
Bustin' out

We're bustin' out of this serious joint
It was too square for me, do you get my poin?
We're bustin' out and we're free from the square
We done braided our hair, we don't mind if you stare
We're bustin' out and we don't give a damn
If you don't like our funk then take your stuff and scram

We're bustin' out on the funk
We're bustin' out on some serious funk, y'all
We're bustin' out on the funk

Bustin' out
We're bustin' out, we couldn't wait
L seven just the letter too damn straight
Now that we're free to communicate

And we're all a little stoned and we freak when we're at home
And for me I only freak when I'm bustin' out
And we're all a little stoned and we freak when we're at home
And for me I only freak when I'm bustin' out

We're bustin' out on the funk
We're bustin' out on some serious funk
We're bustin' out on the funk
We're bustin' out on some serious funk

We're bustin' out on the funk
We're bustin' out on some serious funk
We're bustin' out on the funk
We're bustin' out on some serious funk

We're bustin' out on the funk
We're bustin' out on some serious funk
We're bustin' out on the funk
We're bustin' out on some serious funk
Bustin' out

// Spacey Love //

I can tell by the way you look there lady,
And you're freaky style upsets me... it drives me wild baby
I know you know how to make me feel at ease
Won't you please, won't you please
Tell me something good, tell me something bad
Make me feel happy baby, make me feel sad

For that spacey love, for your spacey love baby
I want your spacey love... Baby give me all your love
Well... woo woo give it to me gently baby, sweet baby well, well

Oh Labelle, you don't ring alone my lady
You had two angels by your side and they helped you fly
I hope and pray that one day you'll hear
And take me... to your stratosphere, yeah yeah
Sing to me again, tell me about those rainbows far away
Say to me in French, voulez-vous coucher avec moi

// Cop N Blow //

(Do-do-do-do-do...)
Uh, say girl
You look fine, freaky thing, you
I've got some love rap to put on you

Love me tender, love me right
Treat me special, come here tonight
Give me pleasure, and I'll give you fun
I'm not that kind of guy who likes to hit-n-run

I bet no one has ever said such things to you
Well pay attention, cause I'm not through
I bet no one has shown you what true love could be
It's happened to you, since you met me

Oh, I've been hurt by love before
Girl I know in my heart

Aah... blow!
I don't ever wanna cop-n-blow
No no, no no, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Blow!
I don't wanna cop-n-blow
No no, I don't wanna cop-n-blow, baby

Instead...

(Do-do-do-do-do...)
Uh, say young girl
I know you're old enough to understand what I'm saying to you
Now get on this, baby

Come on sweet thing, girl don't be shy
I won't hurt you, or make you cry
That's not my way girl, that's not my style
You'll feel so good girl, I think I'll stay a while

I bet no one has ever said such things to you
Talkin' sweet talk, the way I do
I bet no one has shown you what true love could be
Just come on baby, and follow me

Oh, I've been hurt by love before
And I know in my heart

Aah... blow!
I never ever wanna cop-n-blow
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Blow! No, no
I never ever wanna cop-n-blow
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Blow! Oh, no
I never ever wanna cop-n-blow
Baby, baby
Blow! Oh, no
I never ever wanna cop-n-blow
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Baby baby, blow!

// Jefferson Ball //

May I, my lady...
Escort you to Jefferson ball?
Yeah

My clothes on tough satin
My horse, not the white one
I bear deeper riches
No thang, no, no
But I have been waiting
Anticipating
In hopes that my lady
I might take you to the ball
And love you, it's all

May I, my lady
May I, my lady
Escort you to Jefferson ball?
Yeah

I've seen you each morning
Since you were a baby
And now you're the queen of my heart
Maybe one day I'll know you
Maybe then I'll show you
My plan to see castles
On Venus and Mars
We'll make love in the stars

May I, my lady (may I, my lady)
May I, my lady (may I, my lady)
Escort you to Jefferson ball?

May I my lady, now may I?
Now may I, my lady, now may I?
May I my lady, now may I?
Now may I, my lady, now may I?
May I my lady, now may I?
Now may I, my lady, now may I?
May I my lady, now may I?
Now may I, my lady, now may I?

If you come to the ball
And we love after all
When the dancing is through
I'll make sure of you
There's no need to say no
If you do, I won't go
There'll be no ball

When you come to the ball

Yeah...

You know, in our livetimes, of living, learning, loving each other
There comes a time when we all must kinda like... just sit down
Think about the love we give to one another
It's not a hard thing to give up the feeling, whether it be black or white
There's no color to the feel, the love makes anything alright
So think love, feel love, try love, taste love
Know love, grow love, touch love, it's yours

You're not black, you're not white
You're not cool as the ice
You're not high as the sun
You're my lover one
And you make me those things
And you teach me to sing
I feel in your arms
I'm the only one

Baby
Baby
Baby
Baby...

May lady, my lady, my lady
Could it be I...

// Fool On The Street //

Love, came quite by surprise
Hit me right between my eyes
And made me realize
You and I
We were born right from the streets
We both know how to stay alive
We both knew how to shuck and jive
Didn't we, baby?
Such a cold blow when you tried to tear my po' heart down
I was man enough to stand my ground
Even though you didn't want me around
I was a fool, baby

Now you come right back on the scene
Tryna run that same game on me
Stop playin' with my heart
Just leave before you start
Furthermore, my baby (Furthermore, baby)
I won't be fooled no more
(I won't be fooled)
Furthermore, my baby (Furthermore, baby)
I won't be fooled no more
(I won't be fooled)

I was a fool, baby
But I won't be fooled no more

Love, the day you walked on me I died
For days I sat around and cried
I even thought of taking my life
I was a fool, yeah
As time went on, I grew stronger within myself
I wrote a song and changed my name
From the street I went to wealth and fame, ah yeah
Now this fool on the street
That you knew and loved a long time ago
Has died and changed his name
Somebody else has taken his place, and he doesn't know your face

Now you come right back on the scene
Tryna run that same game on me
Stop playin' with my heart
Just leave before you start
Furthermore, my baby (Furthermore, baby)
I won't be fooled no more
(I won't be fooled)
Furthermore, my baby (Furthermore, baby)
I won't be fooled no more
(I won't be fooled)

Yeah, you fooled me but you'll never fool me anymore
I was a fool for you, baby
Yeah, you fooled me but you'll never fool me anymore
Yeah, I was a fool on the street
Yeah, you fooled me but you'll never fool me anymore
Yeah, you fooled me but you'll never fool me anymore

Had enough, had enough, had enough, had enough
Had enough, had enough, had enough, had enough

I was a fool for you, baby
I was a big fool, baby, but I won't be no more
Fool for you, baby
Fool for you, baby
Big fool, baby
I was a stupid bloomin' fool, yeah, yeah yeah

When you are on the street and someone you meet
Don't be foolin' me, don't be foolin' me
When you are on the street and someone you meet
Don't be foolin' me, don't be foolin' me
When you are on the street and someone you meet
Don't be foolin' me, don't be foolin' me
When you are on the street and someone you meet
Don't be foolin' me, don't be foolin' me
When you are on the street and someone you meet
Don't be foolin' me, don't be foolin' me
When you are on the street and someone you meet
Don't be foolin' me, don't be foolin' me
When you are on the street and someone you meet
Don't be foolin' me, don't be foolin' me
When you are on the street and someone you meet
Don't be foolin' me, don't be foolin' me
