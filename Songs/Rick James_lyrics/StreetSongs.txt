// Give It To Me Baby //

When I came home last night
You wouldn't make love to me
You went fast asleep
YOu wouldn't even talk to me
said I'm so crazy
Coming home intoxicated
I said I just wanna love ya
(I just wanna love you baby)
Guess that's why I'm so elated (C'mon girl)

Give it to me baby (give to me baby)
Give it to me baby (give to me baby)
Make it hot like you've had enough
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
Just give it to me baby
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
I'll make you hot like you had enough

Give it to me
Give me that stuff
that funk
that sweet

(Give it to me)

that funk
that sweet
that funky stuff
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give me that stuff
that sweet, funky stuff

Oooooh HOW woo

(Give to me baby)

When I was high as the sky
Out all night just dancing
You say let's go home (c'mon, I'm tired let's go home)
That's the time I start romancin'
You say "how can I love ya?" 
(how can I love you baby)
"When your body keeps on moving"
I say "Wait til I sqeeze you" (oh)
Maybe then you'll start to groovin'
(c'mon girl)

Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
(I betcha) I'll make ya hot like you had enough
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
(Just give it to me babyy)
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
(I betcha) I'll make ya hot like you had enough

Give it to me
Give me that stuff
that funk
that sweet
that funky stuff
(Give it to me)

Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give me that stuff

Give it to me what you say 
Give it to me what you say 
Give it to me
Give it to me (hey)
Give it to me

// Ghetto Life //

When I was a young boy
Growing up in the ghetto
Hanging out on corners
Singin' with the fellas
Lookin' for the Gypsy
Trying to find a bit of fun
Looking for some trouble
Or anyone who'll give me some

I was young and crazy
In the ghetto
Didn't know what my life would be
In the ghetto
I was dumb and oh so lazy
In the ghetto
Something had a spell on me
In the ghetto

You wanna know what I'm talkin' bout?
Talkin' 'bout ghetto life
Ghetto Liiiiiiiiiiiife
You wanna know what I'm singin' 'bout?
Talkin' 'bout ghetto life
Ghetto Liiiiiiiiiiiife

When I was a young man
Kind of free and fancy
Met this little cute girl
She said her name was Nancy
She had pigtails to her shoulders
She couldn't have been much older
She taught me what I had to know
To make a girl not want to go

She was very kinky
In the ghetto
She laid her pigtails down on me
In the ghetto
And I was feeling oh so sneaky
In the ghetto
I had to see what love could be
In the ghetto

I knew it all along
That my game was strong
But I was wrong that time
I knew I had to pray
And give myself away
Did you think I was man enough?
Yeah
Did you think I was smart enough?
Yeah
Did you think I was strong enough?
Yeah
Did you think I'd work it out?

The Ghetto Life

Sing it to ya, hit it baby baby
Talkin 'bout ghetto life
You got to get on over
Talkin 'bout ghetto life

When I was a young boy
Tenements, slums and corner bums
Playing tag with winos
The only way to have some fun
One thing 'bout the ghetto
You don't have to hurry
It'll be there tommorow
So brother don't you worry

Ghetto Life
Talking 'bout ghetto life
Talking 'bout Ghettoo Liiiiiiiiife
Ghetto Life, baby
Talkin' 'bout ghetto life

Life

Life
(Talkin' 'bout ghetto life)
Shoop Shoop Shoop Shoop, Shoop be doop in the ghetto
People we got to get over
Shoop Shoop Shoop Shoop, Shoop be doop in the ghetto
Talkin' 'bout the life
Shoop Shoop Shoop Shoop, Shoop be doop in the ghetto
Life

Where's the place we funk?
Ghetto Land that's the place we funk
The place we like to funk
Ghetto Land that's the place where we funk
Say where the place we funk
Ghetto Land that's the place where we funk
The place we like to funk
Ghetto Land that's the place where we funk
Ho!
The place we like to funk

Ghetto Land, we like to funk
Where the place, we like to funk

Ghetto Land, that's the place
Where we funk from day to day
Ghetto Land Ghetto Land

// Make Love To Me //

Taste so good to the very last drop
You on bottom and me on top
Rollin' around to the saxophone sound
Feel so good don't wanna come down
Make love to me baby
Do it nice and slow
Make love to me woman
Let your feelings show - hey baby
Feel so good soaking wet like the rain
So soft and gentle and we show no shame
Kissing you baby only you and I know
Feel so good just let your love flow
Make love to me
Let your feelings show
Feelin' hot, feelin' cold
Feelin' young and feelin' old
That's what I feel when I'm holding you tighter squeezin' you baby
Loving you with all my might
All I'm askin' is just to make love to you
(Hey baby hey baby well, well)
Don't you dare be nervous, don't you dare be shy
Just let me make sweet love to you baby
Don't you dare be nervous, don't you dare be shy
There's no need to wonder why
Don't you dare be nervous when I call your name
What will you do when 1 call your name
Will you come like the fallin' rain?
Come like the fallin' rain
Come like the fallin' rain
Feels so good
Woman do me
Woman do me good
Do me
Do me

// Mr. Policeman //

Hey Mr. Policeman
I've seen you in my neighborhood
You look to me up to no good
I've seen you with your gun in your hand
Hey Mr. Policeman
I saw you shoot my good friend down
He was just havin' fun
Checkin' out a one & one
It's a shame and disgrace
Everytime you show your face
Somebody dies man
La la la la la la la la la
Hey Mr. Policeman
Why don't you leave the boys alone
Why don't you just roll your own
And call me on the telephone
Hey Mr. Policeman
I see you walkin' on your beat
Searchin' strangers on the street
Especially the whores you meet
It's a shame such a disgrace
Everytime you show your face
Somebody dies man
Somebody dies
[Police monologue, Siren]
This is a car #54 wait to check out etc...
Hey Mr. Policeman
I saw you shoot my good friend down
He was just havin' fun checkin' out a one & one
Hey Mr. Policeman
I see you never havin' fun
Strapped to your side a gun
.357 Smith Magnum
It's a shame & disgrace
Everytime you show your face
Somebody dies man
I'd rather be a farmer than to be a police
I'd rather be a singer than to be a police
I'd rather be a father than to be a police

// Super Freak //

She's a very kinky girl
The kind you don't take home to mother
She will never let your spirits down
Once you get her off the street, ow girl

She likes the boys in the band
She says that I'm her all-time favorite
When I make my move to her room
It's the right time
She's never hard to please

Oh, no

Super freak, super freak

She's a very special girl
(The kind of girl you want to know)
From her head down to her toenails
(Down to her feet, yeah)
And she'll wait for me at backstage
With her girlfriends
In a limousine
(Going back in Chinatown)

Three's not a crowd to her, she says
(MÃ©nage Ã  trois)
Room 714, I'll be waiting
When I get there she's got incense
Wine and candles
It's such a freaky scene

That girl is pretty kinky
(The girl's a super freak)
The kind of girl you read about

// Fire And Desire //

Wow, it's really good to see you again, baby
And I must admit you're looking very, very, very nice these days
I guess life must be treating you well, oh, me
Well, Ive just been doin' the same ol' thing I've always been doin'

You know, I've got a new lady now
And it's a little different then it was when I was with you
You know, I think back to when we met
The way I use to be and the cold way I used to act

But more than that
I think of how you changed me
With your love and sensitivity
Remember when I used to

Love them and leave them
That's what I used to do
Use and abuse them
Then I laid eyes on you

It was pain before pleasure
That was my claim to fame
With every measure, baby
Tasted teardrop stains, yeah

I was cold as ice long ago, baby, baby
I wasn't very, very, very nice, you know
Sugar, sugar, sugar
Then I kissed your lips

And you tuned on my fire, baby
And you burn me up within your flame
Took me a little higher
Made me live again

You turned on my fire, baby
Then you showed me what a love could do
Fire and desire, baby
Feel it comin' through

And I thank you, baby
Oh, how I thank you, baby
You taught me so much
And you showed me so much and love and insensitivity

That since you've been gone
I don't think I've ever felt this way before
You know it's funny how a man can change
So quickly from a cold blooded person

Thinkin' he's God gift to women
Remember how I use to do that
I must have been crazy then
Remember when you used to

Love them and leave them
Oh, that's what I used to do
Use them and abuse them, whoa
Then I laid eyes on you

It was pain before pleasure
Oh, that was my claim to fame
With every measure
Tasted your teardrop stains, yeah

You were cold as ice, baby, baby
(Woo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
(I, I wasn't, I, I wasn't very nice, I know, woo)
Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar
Then I kissed your lips

And you  turned on
(You turned on, you turned on)
(You turned on my fire)
My fire, baby
(Ooh)

Then you showed me what a love could do
(Woo, hoo)
Fire and desire
(Fire and desire)
Feelin' good to you
(Feelin' good to you)

You turned on my fire, baby
(Fire, ooh, ooh)
(Oh, baby)
And you burn me up within your flame

(You burn me, you burn me)
Fire and desire
(Fire and desire)
And were both to blame, both to blame
(Ooh, ooh)

You know, I guess I think we both said a little too much today
(No, ooh, hoo, hoo)
After all Tee, you're kind of with somebody else
I'm kind of livin' with somlivinebody
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

But please do me a favor just before you go
(What is it, baby)
Just put your arms around me and hold me like you used
(I wanna hold you tight)

Tell me "Rick", "Everything is gonna be alright"
(Everything, everything, everything is gonna be alright)
Put your arms around me
Put your arms around me
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Oh, baby
(Woo, ooh, ooh)
Oh, baby
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh)

// Call Me Up //

Love me tender baby
I don't like no pain (I don't like no pain)
Make me surrender sugar
When you call my name (my name is Rick)
Rock me roll me
Baby don't you stop (Don't you ever stop)
Wake me shake me
When your love gets hot
I can feel your body burning to my flesh
Like fire, hot fire
Baby you can call me up (You know my number)
Hey baby you can call me up
Call me up
Touch me places baby
I've never been touched before (You can do it baby)
Kiss me in spaces make me holler out for more
Give more & more
Give me pleasure baby
Give me every bit you got (Give it to me baby)
Make me feel better by telling me
You'll never stop (Say you'll never stop)
I can feel your body burnin' to my flesh
Like fire hot fire
[Repeat 1st and 2nd verses]
Baby when you want a hand to hold
When you don't want to be alone just gotta call me up
Baby when you do it all night
When you want to get it right
Just gotta call me up
Baby when you want my lovin' around
And when you want to get on down
Just gotta call me up
Baby when you want to do it all night
When you want to get it right
Just gotta call me up

// Below The Fun (Pass The J) //

I was born in a city we call Buffalo
Zero degrees below is too damn cold and funky
Mama raised me on the numbers racket
With eight kids and no father
Said she couldn't hack it
On the eastside where I started
Singin' on the corners
Hangin' out with all the hoodlums
Pass the joint
Now the love I find in the city
Is such a cryin' pity
Ain't no love for brothers
Pass the joint
I think I want to talk
'Bout the place I was born, I was torn
Said pass the joint
Give me one mo' hit
I ain't finished with it
I got some more to say
Now the players hangin' 'round the main strip
Actin' like they're on a trip
If they had my cash they could be hip
But it's strange the gossip is so tragic
They call me a faggot
Me and all my women laugh at it
Love I got my good friends there
They really keep me dancin'
They really keep me laughin'
In the country me, my dog and horses
Hangin' out with my family talkin'
'Bout stone city
Pass the joint
I wanna talk 'bout the city I was born
I think I wanna talk 'bout the place where I was torn
Said pass the joint
I need one mo' hit
I ain't finished with it
I got some more to say
'Bout the city I was born
I got to talk
I wish they wouldn't be so torn
I wanna talk 'bout the city I was bred
I need to talk 'bout the city that has led me to my thang
I was born in a city we call buffalo
Zero degrees below is too damn cold and funky
I think I wanna talk about it
Ooh pass the. Joint
La la la la la la la la la
I think I wanna sing about it
Pass the joint
Thank you
