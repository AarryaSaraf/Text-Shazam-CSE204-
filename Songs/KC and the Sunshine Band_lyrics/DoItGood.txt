// Queen Of Clubs //

In every night club across the nation
Sheâs the life of the party, sheâs a real sensation
Sheâs got style, yâall, sheâs got class
She can groove it slow or move it fast
In the early eveninâ through the midnight hour
She keeps swinginâ, sheâs got super power

Sheâs the queen of clubs
Sheâs the queen of clubs

If you throw a party and she ainât there, well, well, well, well
People let me tell you that your partyâs nowhere
From city to city and coast to coast
Sheâs more than hip now, sheâs the most
Up in the mountains, out on the plains
Down in the valley they echo her name

Sheâs the queen of clubs
Sheâs the queen of clubs

Here she comes - fine lady
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Sheâs the queen of clubs - out in the valley
Sheâs the queen of clubs
Sheâs the queen of clubs ....

I'm so glad...

I will never find another lover
Sweeter than you

And I will never find another lover
More precious than you

Girl you are..
Close to me you're like my mother,
Close to me you're like my father,
Close to me you're like my sister,
Close to me you're like my brother
And you are the only one my everything
And for you this song I sing....

All my life
I prayed for someone like you
And I thank god
That I...that I finally found you
All my life
I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me too

I'd send you all that I'm thinking of...baby

Said I promise to never fall in love with a stranger
You're all I'm thinking of
I praise the lord above
For sending me your love
I cherish every hug
I really love you

All my life (ohhhh..baby, baby)
I prayed for someone like you
And I thank god
That I...that I finally found you
All my life
I prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me

You're all that I ever know,
When you smile all my face always seems to glow,
You turn my life around,
You pick me up when I was down,
You're all that I ever know,
When you smile my face glow
You pick me up when I was down
Say...you're all that I ever know
When you smile my face glows
You pick me up when I was down
And I hope that you
Feel the same way too
Yes I pray that you do love me too

And all my life
I prayed for someone like you
And I thank god
That I...that I finally found you
All my life
I prayed for someone like you
Yes, I pray that you do love me too

All my life
I prayed for someone like you
And I thank god
That I...that I finally found you
All my life

Yes, I pray that you do love me too
