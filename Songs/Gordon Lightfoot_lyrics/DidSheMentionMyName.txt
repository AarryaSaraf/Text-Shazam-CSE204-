// Wherefore & Why //

When I woke this mornin', something inside of me told me this would be my day
I heard the morning train, I felt the wind change, too many times I'm on my way
Come on sunshine, what can you show me
Where can you take me to make me understand
The wind can shake me, brothers forsake me
The rain can touch me, but can I touch the rain

And then I saw the sunrise above the cotton sky like a candycane delight
I saw the milkman, I saw the business man, I saw the only road in sight
Then I got to thinkin' what makes you want to go, to know the wherefore and the why

So many times now, oh lord I can't remember if it's september or july

Then all at once it came to me, I saw the wherefore, and you can see it if you try
It's in the sun above, it's in the one you love, you'll never know the reason why

Come on sunshine, what can you show me
Where can you take me to make me understand
The wind can shake me, brothers forsake me
The rain can touch me, but can I touch the rain
So much to lose, so much to gain

// The Last Time I Saw Her //

The last time I saw her face, her eyes were bathed in starlight and her hair hung long
The last time she spoke to me, her lips were like the scented flowers inside a rain-drenched forest
But that was so long ago that I can scarcely feel the way I felt before
And if time could heal the wounds, I would tear the threads away that I might bleed some more
The last time I walked with her
Her laughter was the steeple bells
That ring to greet the morning sun
A voice that called to everyone
To love the ground we walked upon
Those were the days

The last time I held her hand, her touch was autumn, spring and summer, and winter too
The last time I let go of her, she walked a way into the night
I lost her in the misty streets, a thousand months, a thousand years
When other lips will kiss her eyes
A million miles beyond the moon, that's where she is

But that was so long ago that I can scarcely feel the way I felt before
And if time could heal the wounds, I would tear the threads away that I might bleed some more
The last time I saw her face, her eyes were bathed in starlight and she walked alone

The last time she kissed my cheek
Her lips were like the wilted leaves
Upon the autumn covered hills
Resting on the frozen ground
The seeds of love lie cold and still
Beneath a battered marking stone
It lies forgotten

// Black Day In July //

Black Day in July
Motor City madness has touched the countryside
And through the smoke and cinders you can hear it far and wide 
The door are quickly bolted and the children locked inside
Black Day in July
Black Day in July
And the soul of Motor City is feared across the land
As the book of law and order is taken in the hands
Of the sons of the fathers who were carried to this land
Black Day in July
Black Day in July
In the streets of Motor City there's a deadly silent sound
And the body of a dead youth lies stretched upon the ground
Upon the filthy pavements no reason can be found
Black Day in July
Black Day in July
Motor City madness has touched the countryside
And the people rise in anger and the streets begin to fill
And there's gunfire from the rooftops and the blood begins to spill
Black Day in July
In the mansion of the Governor there's nothing that is known for sure
The telephone is ringing and the pendulum is swinging
And the wonder how it happened and  they really know the reason
And it wasn't just the temperature and it wasn't just the season
Black Day in July
Black Day in July
Motor City's burning and the flames are running wild
They reflect upon the waters of the river and the lake
And everyone is listening and everyone's awake
Black Day in July
Black Day in July
The printing press is turning and the news is quickly flashed
And you read your morning paper and you sip your cup of tea
And you wonder just in passing is it him or is it me
Black Day in July
In the Office of the President the deed is done the troops are sent
There's really not much choice you see it looks to us like anarchy
And then the tanks go rolling in  patch things up as best they can
There is no time to hesitate the speech is made the dues can wait
Black Day in July
Black Day in July
The streets of Motor City now are are quiet and serene
But the shapes of gutted buildings strike terror to the heart
And you say how did it happen and you say how did it start
Why can't we all be brothers why can't we live in peace
But the hands of the the have-nots keep falling out of reach
Black Day in July
Black Day in July
Motor City madness has touched the countryside
And through the smoke and cinders you can hear it far and wide
The door are quickly bolted and the children locked inside
Black Day in July
Black Day in July
Black Day in July

// May I //

Finders, keepers, losers, weepers
Ring around the rosy and I'll catch you if I can
And if you don't say may I, then you'll have to start again
But first you must indulge me and count from one to ten
Let the game begin 
I adore you when you touch me
Pin the tail upon the donkey, you will surely win
And if you don't say may I, then I'll pass the cake around
And I won't give you any, but you won't make a sound
You don't eat soap, anyhow 

Red light, green light, blue light, yellow light
You can take three giant steps or a baby step will do
But if you don't say may I, then I'll march you out the door
Where you'll be contemplating the numbers one to four
I hope you're keeping score 

Cause if you don't say may I, then I'll get you with the hose
And spoil your Sunday clothes Will it please you if I tease you
While you're at the spindry, I'll pass the pie around
But you won't make a sound
You don't eat blackbird anyhow 

There's four and twenty reasons why it can't be wrong
How long have you been gone
Finders, keepers, losers, weepers
Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater
Wear your sneakers around sound sleepers

// Magnificent Outpouring //

It is said that all the good things
Must come to him who can pretend
He doesn't have to wait
For as surely as the light of day
Must come to drive the night away
The needles and the pins
That's where the line begins 
With your magnificent outpouring
Of that old familiar story
That's been used a million times
To ease a million minds 

There are times when I have told you
That htere must be two of us
To try to work things out
But if I can't see you every day
Then I must hide my thoughts away
And see you when I can
And try to understand 

With your magnificent outpouring
Of that old familiar story
That's been used a million times
To ease a million minds 

So let us treat our love likeany game
To fan the flames would really be a sin
For as surely as the snow must fall
I shall be waiting for your call
Pretending it is spring
And you'll be mine again 

With your magnificent outpouring
Of that old familiar story
That's been used a million times
To ease a million minds

// Does Your Mother Know //

Does your mother know
You had to go someday 
Does your mother know
That you would go so fast
Anyway, that's all you think about
You'd call her if you could 
But the letters that you write
In the faded winter light
Just tell her they tell her
That you've got ten dollars and you'll be all right
And when you get straight you're gonna come back east some day 

Does your mother know
You have a man in the West
Does your mother know
You drove him from your door
Anyway that's all you think about
You'd call her if you could 

Does your mother know
You walked all day in the rain
Does your mother know
How deep your love could be
Anyway that's all you think about
You'd call her if you could 

But the letters that you write
In the faded winter light
Just tell her they tell her
That you've got ten dollars and your rent costs eight
And when you get straight you're gonna come back east some day 

But the letters that you write in the faded winter light
Just tell her they tell her

// The Mountains And Maryann //

All is well
I've made my peace where highways never end
Yesterday's a memory today is just a friend
For the mountains and Maryann are calling me again
And the red pines will bow their heads
The rivers and the watersheds will swallow up my tears 
All is well
I left the cold midwestern towns behind
There's a semi up the road ahead I'll take him in my time
For the hot-blooded mountain love is calling me again
And the vagabond within me cries
The wind and rain might burn my eyes but I won't feel the pain
For the mountains and Maryann will greet me there as only she can do 

All is well
As I swing up to the border bent for hell
And the service station man agreed I didn't look too well
But the mountains and Maryann are calling out to me
And I got my bedroll on my back 
And everything that I could pack to see me on my way 

All is well
I've made my peace and man, I'm feelin' fine 
And the losers that I left behind I'll think about some other time
For the border men were all my friends they couldn't find a dime
And the prairie towns go sailing by
Saskatchewan there's mud in your eye I'm leavin' you behind
There'll be hot-blooded mountain love to satisfy my soul
And the red pines will bow their heads
The rivers and the watersheds will carry us along
And the mountains and Maryann will greet me there as only she can do 

All is well
The foothills are coming into sight
Today is just a memory the future is tonight
And the red pines will bow their heads
The rivers and the watersheds will carry us along 
And the mountains and Maryann will greet me there as only she can do

// I Want To Hear It From You //

I want to hear it from you
I want to hear it from someone who knows how it is
All the second-hand words seem to get in my way
I want to hear it from you 
I want to hear it again
I want to know if the soft scented touch of your lips
Must be taken away like a mother's first kiss to the life that she gives 

I've got a right to get it straight from you
To give my life a different point of view 
To find a way to keep from losing you 

If you don't know what to say
To understand is my life and the question is why 
You should cry in the night while your eyes look away
Every time that I speak and there's nothing to say 

I want to hear it from you
I want to hear it from you
Let me know how you feel
You've got to make up your mind
Tell me where I can run
When my roof tumbles in 

I want to hear it from you
I want to hear it from you

// Something Very Special //

She was something very special to me
The kind of girl you'd like to see
In a movie or a rosary 
She could be straight-laced or homespun 
Or free and easy on the run
She could be meek and mild or full of fun

She liked country lanes and aeroplanes
And cigarettes would make her strange
And when she wanted you she made it plain 

She would never say where she came from 
It didn't seem that she had anyone
To answer to or dwell upon 

She liked candlelight and good wine
And I would call her any time
Of day or night she didn't mind 

The was nothing that I wouldn't do
To prove to her my love was true
And she gave to me a dream or two 

There were times when she would never appear
For days and then she'd disappear
But now the days have turned to years 

I was something she could use
Like a good friend or a pair of shoes
Or any kind of good news 

Now the eastern sky is crimson and red
As I lie here in my lonely bed
And think about the things she said 

She said darling there will come a day
When I must run far away
I will go my love and you must stay 

She departed in the early spring
She didn't leave me anything
To follow or to find her 

She was something very special to me
The kind of girl you'd like to see
In a movie or a rosary

// Did She Mention My Name //

It's so nice to meet an old friend and pass the time of day
And talk about the home town a million miles away
Is the ice still in the river, are the old folks still the same
And by the way, did she mention my name
Did she mention my name just in passing
And when the morning came, do you remember if she dropped a name or two
Is the home team still on fire, do they still win all the games
And by the way, did she mention my name

Is the landlord still a loser, do his signs hang in the hall
Are the young girls still as pretty in the city in the fall
Does the laughter on their faces still put the sun to shame
And by the way, did she mention my name

Did she mention my name just in passing
And when the talk ran high, did the look in her eye seem far away
Is the old roof still leaking when the late snow turns to rain
And by the way, did she mention my name

Did she mention my name just in passing
And looking at the rain, do you remember if she dropped a name or two
Won't you say hello from someone, there'll be no need to explain
And by the way, did she mention my name
