// This Is Always //

This isn't sometimes, this is always
This isn't maybe, this is always
This is love, the real beginning of forever

This isn't just mid summer madness
A passing glow, a moment's gladness
Yes it's love, I knew it on the night we met

You tied a string around my heart
So how can I forget you?
With every kiss I know that this is always

// All Or Nothing At All //

All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all

// The Way You Look Tonight //

Some day, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me but to love you
And the way you look tonight

With each word your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart

Lovely, never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it?
Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight
Just the way you look tonight

// When The Sun Comes Out //

When the sun comes out
And that rain stops beatin' on my window pane
When the sun comes out
There'll be bluebirds 'round my door, singin' like they did before

That ol' storm broke out
And my gal walked off and left me in the rain
Though she's gone I doubt
If she'll stay away for good, I'd stop livin' if she should

Love is funny, it's not always peaches, cream and honey
Just when everything looked bright and sunny
Suddenly the cyclone came, I'll never be the same

Til that sun comes out
And the rain stops beatin' on my window pane
If my heart holds out
Let it rain and let it pour, it may not be long before
There's a knockin' at my door
Then you'll know the one I love walked in
When the sun comes out
...

// Everything I've Got Belongs To You //

I got eyes for you to give you dirty looks
I have words that do not come from children's books
There's a trick with a knife I'm learning to do
And everything I've got belongs to you

I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist
There are hammerlock holds I've mastered a few
And everything I've got belongs to you

Share for share, share alike
You get struck each time I strike
You for me, me for me
I'll give you plenty of nothing

I'm not yours for better but for worse
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two
And everything I've got belongs to you

Share for share, share alike
You get struck each time I strike
You for me, me for me
I'll give you plenty of nothing

I'm not yours for better but for worse
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two
And everything I've got
Everything I've got
Everything I've got belongs to you

// It Might As Well Be Spring //

I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had Spring fever
But I know it isn't Spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be Spring
It might as well be Spring

// Yesterdays //

Yesterdays
Yesterdays
Days I knew as happy sweet
Sequestered days
Olden days
Golden days
Days of mad romance and love

Then gay youth was mine
And truth was mine
Joyous free and flaming life
Forsooth was mine
Sad am I
Glad am I
For today I'm dreaming of
Of yesterdays

Then gay youth was mine
The truth was mine
Sad am I
Glad am I
For today I'm dreaming of
Of yesterdays
