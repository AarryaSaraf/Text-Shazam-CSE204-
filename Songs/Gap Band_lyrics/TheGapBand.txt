// You Can Count On Me //

Face of stone, and lips so cold 
A mask for all the world to see 
It's so hard to know what is real 
But baby, you can always count on me 

A prickly thorn, can bear a rose 
A sight for all of us to see 
It seems that life is oh so strange 
But baby, you can always count on me 

Life's solutions, and illusions 
Things are seldom what they seem 
Were surrounded by our confusions 
But baby, you can always count on me 

There will be trials and tribulations 
And heartaches yeah And miseries 
But when it's all over, 
You can always count on me.

// Open Up Your Mind (Wide) //

You say you're trying to handle the situation
But your mind is filled with aggravation
You say you can't turn to your relations
You say you can't deal with world invasion

'Cause your mind is getting tighter
Don't think that the load's gonna get any lighter
Hoping that your world doesn't get any wider
Hoping that your life's gonna get any brighter

If you open up your mind
Turn your head toward the sky
Every little thing's
Gonna get a little better, yeah, yeah
If you open up your mind
Turn your head toward the sky
Reach way down in your heart
And you'll feel better

If you open up your mind
Turn your head toward the sky
Every little thing's
Gonna get a little brighter, yeah, yeah
If you open up your mind
Turn your head towards the sky
Reach way down in your heart
And you'll feel better

Yeah, yeah, yeah, wide
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wide
Oh, baby, baby, yeah, wide
Come on and open up, wide
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wide
Everybody come on, wide
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wide

Come on and open up, wide
Open up your mind, wide

Open up, open, open, open up, wide
Uh-huh, uh-huh, ah, uh-huh, wide
Come on, come on, y'all, wide

As the world turns
Everything we do this evening
Is on the one
Funking on the edge of night this evening
You got your G-A-P
Gonna put it on the three
If you don't believe that, turn to channel two
Ha, on the one this evening
If you wanna funk with me
You have to drop all material things
You see they're not--it's so very important
You have to drop all material things
And come on, on the one side, you see

Wide, come on, come on, come on, go
Wide, mm-hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wide, wide, wide, wide
Wide, ah-ah-ah-ah, uh-huh, come on

Is still on the one this evening
Beyond the edge of night
Beyond sunset tomorrow
You see, we got Robert, we got Ronnie
And your boy Charlie
We gonna put everything on the one the evening
This is G-A-P
We're gonna put it on the one
Still talking about the bad material things
That you are so hung up on this evening, uh-huh
You have it your way and you'll celebrate the day
You see, come on over my side of town
Everything we do is one, the one
You wanna open up your mind up very wide this evening
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on through!

Wide, yeah, yeah, yeah, open, open, open up
Wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, yeah
Wide, wide, wide, wide, wide, hey!
Wide, wide, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah...

// Messin' With My Mind //

I don't know what to do
You're tellin' me that we're through
You've done that to me before
But you won't do it to me no more

There you go, messin' with my mind
There you go, leavin' me behind
Messin' with my mind
Wastin' time, all mine

You said you'd take me home, mmm...
So that we could be alone
But you told another lie
Girl, I don't know why

There you go, messin' with my mind
There you go, leavin' me behind
There you go, messin' with my mind
Wastin' time, yours and mine
No, no, no, no

Messin' with my mind, there you go

Wastin' time, all mine
But I knew before
But you won't do it to me no more, yeah

There you go, messin' with my mind
There you go, messin' with my mind
There you go, messin' with my mind
There you go, messin' with my mind
(Leavin' me behind)

There you go, messin' with my mind
There you go, messin' with my mind
(Leavin' me behind)
There you go, messin' with my mind
There you go, messin' with my mind
(Leavin' me behind)
There you go, messin' with my mind
There you go, messin' with my mind
(Leavin' me behind)

There you go, there you go
There you go, there you go
There you go, messin' with my mind...
