// Desire //

You ought to do something to make a living
'Cause I have desire, desire...

Desire!
Desire!
Desire!
Desire!

You give me that desire
Work hard all night long
You give me that desire
Keep me goinâ strong

I don't mind workin'
Seven days a week
When I come home to you
I know youâre gonna treat me sweet

Desire keeps me goin' strong
Desire keeps me burnin' like a red hot fire

I really don't mind, girl
I don't mind workin' hard
When I come home, girl
I know I'll get my reward

Desire keeps me goin' strong
Desire keeps me burninâ like a red hot fire

Desire

Youâre my inspiration
Will you keep me, please?
Never run from love, babe
Give me all I need

I remember what you told me
The sweet words in my ear
Each time you love me
I know what I wanna hear

Desire keeps me goin' strong
Desire keeps me burninâ like a red hot fire

Desire
Desire

Do-do-do-do-do-do, desire
Do-do-do-do-do-do, desire

Desire keeps me goin' strong
Desire keeps me burnin' like a red hot fire

Desire, desire

Desire keeps me goin' strong
Desire keeps me burninâ like a red hot fire

Desire keeps me goin' strong
Desire keeps me burnin' like a red hot fire

// Going In Circles //

I'm an ever rolling wheel
Without a destination real
And I'm an ever spinning top
Whirling around 'till I drop

Oh, but what am I to do
My mind is in a whirlpool
Give me a little hope
One small thing to cling to

You got me going in circles
Oh, around and around I go
Going in circles
Oh, around and around I go
I'm strung out over you

I'm a faceless clock
With timeless hopes that never stop
When I feel that way
You know my soul's at stake

Oh, but what am I to do
My mind is in a whirlpool
Give me a little hope
One small thing to cling to

You got me going in circles
Oh, around and around I go
Going in circles
Oh, around and around I go
I'm strung out over you

I'm strung out over you( I need you baby)
Uuh, I need (I need you baby)
Call me (I need you baby)
I need baby, my baby, my baby
My baby, my baby girl

// Automatic Brain //

Deep in the land, there is funk
Music has no alternative to stop
But there's a woman that walks around
And when she gets down, this woman has
Automatic, an automatic brain
An automatic brain

Uh! She has an automatic brain
Uh! The kind that drives you insane
Uh! She has an automatic brain
Ah! The kind that drives you insane

The girl has a personality
She make you wanna scream
The girl, the way she walks
In designer jeans
She make you wanna wiggle
She make you wanna talk
But when she shakes her body
She make you wanna walk, watch out!

Uh! She has an automatic brain
Uh! The kind that drives you insane
Hear me out
Oh! She has an automatic brain
Ah! The kind that drives you insane
Hear my now

She has an automatic
Au-automatic, automatic-tic brain
She has an automatic
Au-automatic, automatic-tic brain

She has an automatic
Au-automatic, automatic-tic brain
She has an automatic
Au-automatic-matic brain
(Deep in the land, there's funk)

Uh! Uh!
(Yeah, oh, yeah)
Uh! Ah!
(Oh, yeah, oh, yeah!)
Uh! Ah!
Uh! Ah!
(Deep in the land, there's funk)
Uh!

Deep in the land, there's funk

Uh! She has an automatic brain
Uh! The kind that drives you insane
Hear me out
Uh! She has an automatic brain
Ah! She gonna drive you insane
(Deep in the land, there's funk)

Uh! She has an automatic brain
Uh! The kind that drives you insane
Uh! She has an automatic brain
Uh! She gonna drive you insane
(Deep in the land, there's funk)
Sing it, fellas!

She has an automatic
Au-automatic, automatic-tic brain

The way she walks
And wiggles behind...

// Ooh, What A Feeling //

I want you, I need you
Each and every day
But the feeling inside me
That just won't go away
I lay awake at night
Holding my pillow tight

Ooh, what a feeling
Ooh, what a feeling now, baby
Ooh, what a feeling
Ooh, what a feeling now, baby

You kiss me and hold me
You make me fall in love
Satisfaction is something
You give me so much of
You are my night and day
I never felt this way

Ooh, what a feeling
Ooh, what a feeling now, baby
Ooh, what a feeling
Ooh, what a feeling now, baby

What a feeling, what a feeling
What a feeling, baby
What a feeling, what a feeling
What a feeling, baby, ooh-ooh...

I don't care what nobody say about you
I don't wanna feel surprised
All I know is when you come near me
It feels so nice

Ooh, what a feeling
Ooh, what a feeling now, baby
Ooh, what a feeling
Ooh, what a feeling now, baby

Hey, baby!

I lay awake at night
Holding my pillow tight
Tight, tight, hey
I lay awake at night
Holding my pillow tight

What a feeling
Oh, what a feeling
Oh, what a feeling
Oh, what a feeling...

// I Want A Real Love //

I want a real love
Don't want someone to play with
I want a real love, oh...
I want a true love
Not just another teaser
I want a real love

True love is hard to find
Infatuation can rob you blind
It's time I leave it all behind
I've reached the point in my life
My future's on the line

I want a real love
Don't want someone to play with
I want a real love, oh...
I want a true love
Not just another teaser
I want a real love

I've come a long, long way
But I still got a long way to go
Now you say you wanna journey with me, lady
Well, I think it's only fair
That I let you know

I want a real love, oh-whoa-whoa...
I want a real love, oh-whoa-whoa...
I want a real love, oh-whoa-whoa...
I want a real love, oh-whoa-whoa...
Yeah, yeah

Oh, girl
Be my lady
I wanna say it just one more time

I want a real love, oh-whoa-whoa...
I want a real love, oh-whoa-whoa...
I want a real love, oh-whoa-whoa...
I want a real love, oh-whoa-whoa...

I want a real love, oh-whoa-whoa...
I want a real love, baby, oh-whoa-whoa...
I want a real love, yeah, oh-whoa-whoa...
I want a real love, baby, oh-whoa-whoa...
