// Steppin' (Out) //

Steppin' out on the floor
Boogie woogie woogie some more
If you can boogie with your baby
Baby you can boogie with me
Steppin' out on the one 
We're gonna have a whole lot of fun
If you can boogie with your baby
Baby you can boogie with me

High steppin', low steppin', rock steppin', roll steppin'
Rollin' on down the floor

Steppin' to the rumba boogie baby

// No Hiding Place //

Hi, honey
What you doing?
I want to talk to you

There's a look into your eyes
It's not to my surprise
That you are lonely, girl, yeah
When I listen to you speak
I see that you're so weak
It's in your heart, oh yeah

And you can show your pretty smile
Behind the tears
That's on your face, ooh, yeah
And you can run, you can run
You can run, you can run, you can run
But there's no hiding place, oh, yeah

As you stand there in the room
I see the lonely gloom
That shows on your face, yeah
I wanna see you smile
To lighten up your face
Don't let the world turn you around
Turn you around, turn you around
Turn you around

You can see your pretty smile
That's on my face
I love your smile, oh-oh-oh girl
And you can run, you can run
You can run, you can run, you can run
But there's no hiding place
Oh-oh-oh-oh...

Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

Oh, you can show your pretty smile
Behind your tears
That's on your face
Mm-hmm, oh, yeah, oh...
And you can run, you can run
You can run, you can run, you can run
But there's no hiding place
Uh-huh, whoa-whoa...

And you can run, you can run
You can run, you can run, you can run
But there's no hiding place
Whoa-whoa-whoa-oh...
And you can run, you can run
You can run, you can run, you can run
But there's no hiding place
Whoa-oh, yeah

And you can run, you can run
You can run, you can run, you can run
But there's no hiding place
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
And you can hide, you hide, you can run
You can keep on hiding
But there's no hiding place, oh, no
Whoa-whoa...

Don't let the world turn you around
As there's no hiding place, oh, no
Whoa, yeah
And you can hide, you can run
You can hide, you can run
You can hide, you can run
But there's no hiding place
Oh-whoa-whoa

Over and over and over and over and over
And over and over and over again
You can run
One more time, baby
Over and over and over and over and over
And over and over and over and over again
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa...

And you can hide, you can run
You can hide, you can run
You can hide, you can run, yeah
No hiding place
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Over and under and over and under
And over and under
There's no hiding place
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Over and under and over and under
Over and under
There's no hiding place, alright...

// The Boys Are Back In Town //

Just got off a long hard road back at home again
remeniscing good ole times, the things that happened then

Standing in a summer breeze, whistling in the tall oak trees
no one here but the guys in me, the boys are back in town

Drifted into town one day, my how things had changed
skyscrapers and parking lots, boy its a shame
how music calls you to your fame, get out there and play it's game
come back home the whole town is strange
the boys are back again

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Strolling through a park that day, where a church had been
watching all the young kids play, make their spinning tops spin

happy youthful children sounds mocked a crazy carnival clown
a little boy kicking a ball around, glad we're back in town

Went on to the town square, a crowd was gather there
looking at the pretty girls, the fairest of the fair
The whole damn crowd began to cheer, many friends that we held so dear
made us glad that we were all here, glad we're back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say Na

What the children need to see, is what the world really should be
no one knows but the guys and me, glad we're back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say Na

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na

The boys are back in town

Here me say na

What the children need to see, is what the world really should be
no knows but the guys and me, the boys are back in town

Here me say Na

Na, na na na na na, na na na, na na na na na
