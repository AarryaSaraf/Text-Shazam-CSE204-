// Weak Spot //

Girl, you know my weak spot
You know just what to do
Girl, give me your lovin'
Just the way I want

I'm singin' that 'cause I'm so in love
Like never before
Day by day, I can feel myself fallin'
In love with you more
Nothing else really matters, baby
As long as you're close to me
When you're doing the things you do
No one else can fill my need, yeah

You know my weak spot, baby
You know just where to put your love
You always give me your lovin'
Just the way, the way I want

You're better for me, my love
Than all I've ever known
And now you're the holder of
The key that opens my heart
Till the end of time, I'll be there
Whenever you call my name
Never ever will I set you free
Only you can relight the flame, oh...

You know my weak spot, baby
You know just where to put your love
You always give me your lovin'
Just the way, the way I want

// I Believe //

I'm living on my memories
I'm drifting on my dreams
It's not so unusual
It's not as strange as it seems

Remembering my yesterdays
And the times from the past
It almost reminds one, yeah
Of seeing life through a looking glass, oh...

I believe you gotta need me
Need me or I won't be around, no
I believe you gotta need me
Need me or I won't be around, no

I'm sharing my memories
Sharing all, sharing all my dreams
With you 'cause you're special, yeah, yeah
Oh, baby, do you know what I mean

I believe you gotta need me
Need me or I won't be around, no
I believe you gotta need me
Need me or I won't be around, no

I believe you gotta need me
Need me or I won't be around
No, no, no, no, no, no
I believe you gotta need me
Need me or I won't be around
No, no, no

I believe
If you really love me
You're gonna need me
And I won't be around, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
(Some, some girls like diamonds)
I believe
You're gonna need me
Need me or I won't be around

// Don't You Leave Me //

You just might be the one
I've been searchin' for
The way you make me feel
I've got to have some more
Girl, you're runnin', runnin'
Can't you see the light
You keep me runnin', runnin'
But you're never out of my sight

Oh, it's you, it's you that I'm livin' for
Gonna give you my love and more
Give you the key to my heart's door
Mm, the love that I'm feelin' tonight
Girl, I wanna hold you tight
I wouldn't give you the chance to run
Girl, don't you go

Don't leave me, don't ever go
(Don't you go, please believe, baby)
Don't leave me, don't ever go
Don't leave me, don't ever go

I know you're into me
You told me so yourself
But you still run from me
You know you really care
I'm so lonely, lonely
Lonely as can be
I gave you money, money
Come on and set me free

Oh, it's you, it's you that I'm livin' for
Gonna give you my love and more
You're the key to my heart's door
Come on the love that I'm feelin' tonight
'Cause I just wanna hold you tight
I wouldn't give you the chance to run
Don't you, don't you go, baby

// The Sun Don't Shine Everyday //

What's wrong?
Why are you crying?
Aw...
Aw, you know the sun donât shine everyday

A lonely smile on your face
A broken heart that can't be replaced
The sun don't shine everyday
Ooh, little girl
The sun donât shine everyday, yeah
Ooh, little girl
The sun don't shine everyday

A lonesome tear on your face
From the rain, from the rain
That has long gone away
A cloud that was left behind
Only the sun can erase
Little girl, little girl, don't cry
'Cause you know
That the sun don't shine everyday
Mmm, little girl, little girl
The sun don't shine everyday

A lonely smile, a broken heart
A shattered mind, a shattered mind
That you left behind
A cloud that the sun could only erase
Little girl, little girl, little girl
The sun don't shine everyday
Mmm-mm, I said, little boy
Little girl, little boy
(Little girl, little boy)
(Little girl, little boy)
The sun don't shine everyday

Lift your face and smile
âCause a shattered mind
Will take you back in time
Lift your face and smile
âCause a shattered mind
Will take you back in time
Take you back in time, back in time
Little girl, little boy, little girl
The sun don't shine

I said, lift your face and smile
âCause a shattered mind
Will take you back in time
The sun don't shine
Little girl, little boy
The sun don't shine everyday
The sun don't shine everyday...
