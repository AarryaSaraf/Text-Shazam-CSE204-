// I'm So Tired //

Out here I can barely see my breath
Surrounded by jealousy and death
I can't be reached, only had one call
Dragged underneath, separate from you all

This time I've lost my own return
In spite of everything I've learned
I hid my tracks, spit out all my air
Slipped into cracks, stripped of all my cares

I'm so tired sheep are counting me
No more struggle, no more energy
No more patient and you can write that down
It's all too crazy and I'm not sticking round

// In Defense Of Humans //

In defense of humans

Lay down your power trip

Stop toying with emotions and relationships

Cause you don't rise when people fall


In defense of humans

Lay down your politics

They're all big money and media tricks

Cause you don't rise when people fall


I see you rot this world

I see you ride this world

I see you rape this world

On, off, on, off, on, off

And I don't like what I see

Greed


In defense of humans

Lay down your human pride

We're born into our bodies

No chance to decide

Cause you don't rise when people fall


In defense of humans

Lay down your sticks and stones

Weapons and violence are better off left alone

Cause you don't rise when people fall


I see you rot this world

I see you ride this world

I see you rape this world

On, off, on, off, on, off

And I don't like what I see

Greed


You don't rise when people fall
