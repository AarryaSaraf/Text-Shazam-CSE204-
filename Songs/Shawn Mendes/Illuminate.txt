// Mercy //

You've got a hold of me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around you

Show me an open door
Then you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
I'm saying baby

Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart

I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy

I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
My pride is all I got
I'm saying baby

Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart

Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice

Oh, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy (on my heart)
I'm begging you, begging you please baby
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy (on my heart)
Oh, I'm begging you, I'm begging you, yeah

// Treat You Better //

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

Better than he can

Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

Better than he can

Better than he can

// Three Empty Words //

I'll pick you up at the same time,
At the same place, the same old drive
We'll just talk about our day
To try to fill the awkward space tonight

We'll play the songs we used to love
While we try to fall in love again
We don't know who's wrong or right
We don't even care enough to fight
We're going through the motions
'Cause we can't fix what's broken
And I know it's gonna hurt
But, darling, I'll go first
'Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
No, I won't keep on saying those three empty words

We're still talking everyday
I'm running out of things to say to ya
What's really gonna break my heart
Is to have to tell your little brother

It might be easier to stay
But it'll never be the same, no, oh, no
And if something doesn't change
Then we'll keep on sinking further

Oh, we're going through the motions
'Cause we can't fix what's broken
And I know it's gonna hurt
But, darling, I'll go first
'Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
Those three empty words
Will only make it worse
I'm tired, I can't take it anymore
Those three empty words
Will only make it worse
We're tired, we can't take it anymore

We're going through the motions
'Cause we can't fix what's broken, no
And I know it's gonna hurt
But, darling, I'll go first
I won't keep on saying those three empty words
We don't have to keep on saying those three empty words
No, I can't keep on saying those three empty words

// Don't Be A Fool //

You've got my heart
But I can't let you keep it, babe
Cause I won't be sure that I can stay
And don't waste your time
Trying to pull me in
Cause I'm just a mess
You don't wanna fix

Just promise me one thing that you won't forget
But for now kiss me softly before I say

And don't be a fool
And wait on me darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move

And don't be a fool
And say that you love me
Cause you'll find a man
Who will stand by your side
And will be there for you

And just know that I do
Oh I really like you babe
And I wanna be there for you
For the rest of your days
But I know that you'll hurt
If we keep on doing this
So I'm sorry to end this now
But I know that it's for the best

Don't be a fool
And wait on me darling, yeah
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move

And don't be a fool, yeah
And say that you love me
Cause you'll find a man
Who will stand by your side
And will be there for you

I don't think you'll ever understand
I don't think you'll ever understand
I know that you don't wanna hear this but darling please don't be a fool

Oh, don't be a fool, yeah
And wait on me darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move

Yeah...
Just don't be a fool, yeah
And say that you love me, girl
Cause you'll find a man
Who'll stand by your side
And will be there for you

And don't be a fool
And wait on me darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But don't be a fool

// Like This //

You say it's not supposed to be
Tell me not to waste my time
This was never up to me
But if it was I wouldn't mind

And I'm trying to ignore ya
I try to go on with my day, hey
But I still pick up the phone, yeah
And get lost in what you say

I can try to stop it, all I like
Hands down, I've lost this fight
Thought I was strong enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth

So I guess I'm going down
I guess I'm going down
Like this

And I love it how she's honest
You don't find that nowadays
She's not even drop dead gorgeous
But she kills me anyway

I can try to stop it, all I like
Hands down, I've lost this fight
Thought I was strong enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth

I guess I'm going down
I guess I'm going down
I guess I'm going down
Like this

I can try to stop it, all I like
Hands down, I've lost this fight
Thought I was strong enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth

I can try to stop it, all I like
Hands down, I've lost this fight
And I thought I was strong enough for you
But I just can't hide the truth

So I guess I'm going down
Like this

// No Promises //

Staring out my hotel window
Too much on my mind
Maybe we should keep it simple
We don't have to decide

Oh no we don't need to overcomplicate it
Cause I've been here once before don't even say it

Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises

I've never been a fan of heartbreak
So tell me what you want
Take my hands across your body
We don't have to hold on

Oh no we don't need to overcomplicate it
Cause I've been here once before don't even say it

Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises

Cause I've been living only for this moment
And I don't want to let it slip away
I've been living only for this moment
And I don't know how much that I can take, yeah

Baby please no promises
Cause we won't keep our promises
And I know the consequences
So baby please, baby please no promises
Yeah baby please no promises, yeah
Oh baby please no promises
Baby please
Baby please no promises

// Lights On //

Oh, yeah

Damn, you look so good with your clothes on
And I'm not trying to come off too strong
But you know that I can't help it
Cause girl you're beautiful

And I can't deny I want your body
But I'm a gentleman so I'll be
The one who takes it slowly
Cause girl you're so beautiful

I wanna love you with the lights on
Keep you up all night long
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
Hold you 'til the night's gone
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on

Hey, no

I like the vibe in this hotel room
And I'd really like to get to know you
Start discovering your secrets
Underneath these very sheets

Your skin's so perfect up against me
Your lips are talking when we don't speak
And I never wanna leave this
Cause there's so much left to see

I wanna love you with the lights on
Keep you up all night long
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
And hold you 'til the night's gone
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move

I wanna love you with the lights on
Keep you up all night long
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
Hold you 'til the night's gone
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move

I wanna love you with the lights on
Keep you up all night long
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move
I wanna love you with the lights on
And hold you 'til the night's gone
Darling, I wanna see every inch of you
I get lost in the way you move

I wanna love you with the lights on
Love you with the lights on
Love you with the lights on

// Honest //

Oh, yeah

Hey, how's it going?
Can you meet me down on Adelaide Street?
Can you talk for a moment?
There's no way to say this that easily
And everything I said, I swear I meant it
I need to tell you that this isn't your fault
And I know that I'll probably regret it
And it kills me 'cause the worst part of all

Is that I hate to hurt you but I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need
Oh, you deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby, I'm just tryna be honest, yeah
I'm tryna be honest with ya
You know that I'm sorry
But I'm tryna be honest with ya

Hey, can you listen?
I swear to God to you, there's nobody else
You're gonna say that I'm lying
When I tell you every feeling I felt
Was honest and sincere and that you were different
And when we kissed I felt like that kid in love, yeah
And I know that I'll probably regret it
I might wish I never said this at all

Oh, I hate to hurt you but I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need
Oh, you deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby, I'm just tryna be honest, yeah
I'm tryna be honest with ya
You know that I'm sorry
But I'm tryna be honest with ya

Oh oh oh, I don't want to see you cry
Oh oh oh, swear that I don't want to see you cry

Cause I hate to hurt you but I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need
Oh, you deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby, I'm just tryna be honest

I hate to hurt you but I got to be honest
I can't give you what you need
Oh, you deserve more than I can promise
And I'm just tryna, I'm just tryna
Baby, I'm just tryna be honest

// Patience //

You hit me up, it's late at night, this is the same old story
Your friends should take your phone away
I always give in when you tell me lies to reassure me
I always make the same mistakes, yeah

Ooh, you give me a little taste
Lure me in then you take it from me
Oh, I hate that, I love it cause you're driving me crazy

First you say you love me then you say you don't
I wake up in the morning and I'm all alone
Tell me that you're willing then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up, please, I'm losing my patience
You know I'm losing my patience, yeah

I'm in your room, it's just us two, I feel you getting closer
You rest your head upon my chest, yeah
Deep down I know that this should be the last time I come over
You always leave me such a mess

Ooh, you give me a little taste
Lure me in then you take it from me
Oh, I hate that, I love it cause you're driving me crazy

First you say you love me then you say you don't
I wake up in the morning and I'm all alone
Tell me that you're willing then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up, please, I'm losing my patience
You know I'm losing my patience, yeah

And you gotta stop if you know
So I can start letting go
Cause it's driving me crazy
Yeah, you keep driving me crazy

When you say you love me then you say you don't
Wake up in the morning and I'm all alone
Tell me that you're willing then you say you won't
Yeah, you're driving me crazy

First you say you love me then you say you don't
I wake up in the morning and I'm all alone
Tell me that you're willing then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up, please, I'm losing my patience
You know I'm losing my patience, yeah
Please, I'm losing my patience, yeah

// Bad Reputation //

She got a bad reputation
She takes the long way home
And all of my friends seen her naked
Or so the story goes
Mistakes we all make them
But they won't let it go, no
Cause she's got a bad reputation
But I know what they don't, hmm

And I don't care what they say about you baby
They don't know what you've been through
Trust me, I could be the one to treat you like a lady
Let me see what's underneath, all I need is you

She got a bad reputation
Nobody gets too close
A sight of a soul when it's breaking
Making my heart grow cold
And into the deeper she's sinking
I'm begging her please don't let go
She's got a bad reputation
But she's all that... all I want, though
Hmm, yeah

And I don't care what they say about you baby
They don't know what you've been through
And trust me, I could be the one to treat you like a lady
Let me see what's underneath, all I need is you

Ah, ah, ah, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ooh

Nobody knows the way that I, I know her, said
Nobody knows the weight that's on her shoulders, said
Nobody knows the way that I, I know her, said
She got a bad, she got a bad

Nobody knows the way that I, I know her, said
Nobody knows the weight that's on her shoulders, said
Nobody knows the way that I, I know her, said
She got a bad, she got a bad

And I don't care what they say about you baby
They don't know what you've been through
Trust me, I could be the one to treat you like a lady
Let me see what's underneath, all I need is you

And I don't care what they say about you baby
They don't know what you've been through
Trust me, I could be the one to treat you like a lady
Let me see what's underneath, all I need is you

She got a bad reputation
She takes the long way home

// Understand //

Am I asking all these questions for nothing?
I'm wondering if anyone's there, yeah
And I really need to make a confession
I hate to say that I'm a little bit scared, yeah

But I've been on this train too long
People getting off and on
Praying that I don't forget where I belong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turning into someone else?
I'm praying that I don't forget just who I am

I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand

I'm calling all my friends after midnight, yeah
To remind 'em that I'll always be there for them
It gets lonely when there's no one to talk to
But it's good to know that somebody cares

Cause I've been on this train too long
People getting off and on
I'm praying that I don't forget where I belong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turning into someone else?
I'm praying that I don't forget just who I am

I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand, yeah

Oh yeah

Cause we all get lost sometimes, yeah
Yeah we all get lost sometimes
But don't leave your heart behind, no, yeah
Cause we all get lost sometimes

I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah
No I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand, oh who I am

[Talking:]
When you wake up
Your whole world's flipped
It's just different and you gotta, you know
You gotta, you gotta go with it and
That's just simply growing up
And not see it in a negative way
You have to see it as it's been given to you
I mean, as much as times can be crazy
You're gonna feel like that's where you're supposed to be
You're not gonna feel out of place anymore
You're gonna feel like that's where you are meant to be
You don't have to pretend that it's easy all the time
You just let it go and, and grow with it
And you can't hold on
To the old you
Or the old this
Or the old that
Because you know you change
And it's not changing in a bad way
It's just changing
Because that's what happens in life
You grow up
Everyone moves on
You're just learning
You stay true to yourself
Changing isn't a bad thing
It never was
But at the end of the day, you know
You're the same person
And, and where your heart is
That doesn't change

And every time I ask myself
Am I turning into someone else?
And I just pray to God that I'm still who I am

I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah
No I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand, oh who I am

// Hold On //

Stop, take it in and I
Breathe for a minute, I
Think too much when I'm alone
I never win when I
Keep all my thoughts inside
So I'll pick up the phone

And my dad says, "Shawn, stay with me
Everything will be alright
I know I haven't seen you lately
But you're always on my mind

I don't know what
You're going through
But there's so much life
Ahead of you
And it won't slow down
No matter what you do
So you just gotta hold on
All we can do is hold on, yeah"

These days are flying by
Weeks feel like minutes, I
Can't remember being small
I try to figure it out
I can't seem to find out how
I guess I don't know much at all

And my dad says, "Shawn, stay with me
Everything will be alright
I know I haven't seen you lately
But you're always on my mind

I don't know what
You're going through
But there's so much life
Ahead of you
And it won't slow down
No matter what you do
So you just gotta hold on
All we can do is hold on, yeah
All we can do is hold on
Yeah, you just gotta hold on
Just, just hold on
Just hold on for me"

And my dad says, "Shawn, stay with me
Everything will be alright

I don't know what
You're going through
But there's so much life
Ahead of you
And it won't slow down
No matter what you do
So you just gotta hold on
All we can do is hold on, yeah
Yeah, you just gotta hold on
Just hold on for me"

// Roses //

It's not that I'm afraid I'm not enough for her
It's not that I can't find the words to say
But when she's with him, she seems happier
And I don't want to take that away

How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

I'm not tryna start a fire with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose and I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?

Die or let it go

It's not that I don't care about the love, if you have
It's not that I don't want to see you smile
But there's no way that he can feel the same
Cause when I think of you, my mind goes wild

How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?
I just have to let you know

I'm not tryna start a fire with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose and I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?

You can tell me to stop if you already know
Though I'm not sure my heart can take it
But the look on your face says don't let me go

I'm not tryna start a fire with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose and I need to know
Will you let it die or let it go?

I'm not tryna start a fire with this flame
But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose and I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?

// Mercy (Acoustic) //

You've got a hold of me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around you

Show me an open door
Then you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
I'm saying baby

Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart

I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy

I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
My pride is all I got
I'm saying baby

Please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart

Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice

Oh, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
I'm begging you, begging you please baby
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
Oh, I'm begging you, I'm begging you, yeah

// There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back //

I wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause every time that she gets close, yeah

She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing, mmm
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

There's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back

She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation

Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing, whoa
And maybe I should stop and start confessing
Confessing, yeah

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

There's nothing holdin' me back

'Cause if we lost our minds
And we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright,
Know we would be alright

If you were by my side
And we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright,
I know we would be alright

'Cause if we lost our minds
And we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright,
I know we would be alright

If you were by my side
And we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright,
We would be alright

Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back

There's nothing holdin' me back

I feel so free
When you're with me,
Baby

Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
