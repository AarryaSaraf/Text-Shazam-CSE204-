Album: SmallTownRomance

// Roll Over Vaughan Williams //

Gentle ladies, gentleman
Waiting till the dance begins
Carefully we come to speak
A word for all to hear
If you listen, if you should
We won't be misunderstood
But don't expect the words to ring
Too sweetly on the ear

Live in fear, live in fear
Live in fear

In the gutter, in the street
Off his head or off his feet
Listen to the scratchy voices
Eating at your nerves
Pencils ready, paper dry
Shoot the girls and make 'em cry
Run for cover, things are bad
But now they're getting worse

Live in fear, live in fear
Live in fear, live in fear

Is it painful, is it right?
Does it keep you warm at night?
Fool your friends and fool yourself
The choice is crystal clear
If you break it on your knee
Better men might disagree
Do you laugh or do you stick
Your finger in your ear?

Live in fear, live in fear
Live in fear, live in fear

// I Want To See The Bright Lights Tonight //

I'm so tired of working every day
Now the weekend's come I'm gonna throw my troubles away
If you've got the cab fare, mister you'll do all right
I want to see the bright lights tonight

Meet me at the station don't be late
I need to spend some money and it just won't wait
Take me to the dance and hold me tight
I want to see the bright lights tonight

There's crazy people running all over town
There's a silver band just marching up and down
And the big boys are all spoiling for a fight
I want to see the bright lights tonight

Meet me at the station don't be late
I need to spend some money and it just won't wait
Take me to the dance and hold me tight
I want to see the bright lights tonight

A couple of drunken nights rolling on the floor
Is just the kind of mess I'm looking for
I'm gonna dream till Monday comes in sight
I want to see the bright lights tonight

Meet me at the station don't be late
I need to spend some money and it just won't wait
Take me to the dance and hold me tight
I want to see the bright lights tonight

Take me to the dance and hold me tight
I want to see the bright lights tonight

// Down Where The Drunkards Roll //

See the boys out walking
The boys, they look so fine
Dressed up in green velvet
Their silver buckles shine
Soon they'll be bleary-eyed
Under a keg of wine
Down where the drunkards roll
Down where the drunkards roll

See that lover standing
Staring at the ground
He's looking for the real thing
Lies were all he found
You can get the real thing
It will only cost a pound
Down where the drunkards roll
Down where the drunkards roll

There goes a troubled woman
She dreams a troubled dream
She lives out on the highway
She keeps her money clean
Soon she'll be returning
To the place where she's the queen
Down where the drunkards roll
Down where the drunkards roll

You can be a gambler
Who never drew a hand
You can be a sailor
Who never left dry land
You can be the Lord Jesus
All the world will understand
Down where the drunkards roll
Down where the drunkards roll

// The Great Valerio //

High up above the crowd
The great Valerio is walking
The rope seems hung from cloud to cloud
And time stands still while he is walking
His eye is steady on the target
His foot is sure upon the rope
Alone and peaceful as a mountain
And certain as the mountain slope

We falter at the sight
We stumble in the mire
Fools who think they see the light
Prepare to balance on the wire
But we learn to watch together
And feed on what we see above
Until our heart turn like the seasons
And we are acrobats of love
How we wonder, how we wonder
Watching far below
We would all be that great hero
The great Valerio

Come all you upstart jugglers
Are you really ready yet?
Who will help the tightrope walker
When he tumbles to the net?
So come with me to see Valerio
As he dances through the air
I'm your friend until you use me
And then be sure I won't be there

How we wonder, how we wonder
Watching far below
We would all be that great hero
The great Valerio

// A Heart Needs A Home //

I know the way that I feel about you
I'm never gonna run away
I'm never gonna run away
I never knew the way when I lived without you
I'm never gonna run away
I'm never gonna run away

I came to you when no one could hear me
I'm sick and weary of being alone
Empty streets and hungry faces
The world's no place when you're on your own
A heart needs a home

Some people say that I should forget you
I'm never gonna be a fool
I'm never gonna be a fool
A better life they say if I never met you
I'm never gonna be a fool
I'm never gonna be a fool

Tongues talk fire and eyes cry rivers
Indian givers, hearts of stone
Paper ships and painted faces
The world's no place when you're on your own
A heart needs a home

// For Shame Of Doing Wrong //

It seems like a lifetime since I saw you
Lover lover I've been away too long
When I see lovers holding hands and sighing
I hang my head for shame of doing wrong

Bus wheels spinning, song birds singing break my heart
Take me back to old remembered days
Remind me of the times we spent together
Times before we went our separate ways

I wish I was a fool for you again
I wish I was a fool for you again
I wish I was a fool for you again

I'm sorry for the things I've said, the things I've done
I'm sorry for the restless thief I've been
Please don't make me pay for my deceiving heart
Just turn up your lamp and let me in

I wish I was a fool for you again...

// Beat The Retreat //

I'm beating my retreat
Back home to you
I'm beating my retreat
Back home to you
I'm burning all my bridges
I'm burning all my bridges
I'm burning all my bridges
I'm running back home to you

I'm trailing my colours
Back home to you
I'm trailing my colours
Back home to you
This world is filled with sadness
This world is filled with sadness
This world is filled with sadness
I'm running back home to you

I'll follow the drum
Back home to you
I'll follow the drum
Back home to you
There was no joy in my leaving
There was no joy in my leaving
There was no joy in my leaving
I'm running back home to you

// Don't Let A Thief Steal Into Your Heart //

Don't let a thief steal into your heart
Or you may end up broken hearted
Don't let a whisper tear you apart
Or you'll be right back where you started

How many days does a man think he has
That he can spend his whole time dreamin'
How many schemes is one man thinkin' of
And does he think he's the only one scheming

Don't let a thief steal into your heart
Or you may end up broken hearted
Don't let a whisper tear you apart
Or you'll be right back where you started

Stop your lies and stop your cheating
It never did you no good, no good
How can you say you will when you want to
When you know you never would if you could

Don't let a thief steal into your heart
Or you may end up broken hearted
Don't let a whisper tear you apart
Or you'll be right back where you started

Everyone is in love with money
Strange news 'cause they say that love is blind
How many times did you meet somebody
Who said they had some real peace of mind

Don't let a thief steal into your heart
Or you may end up broken hearted
Don't let a whisper tear you apart
Or you'll be right back where you started

// Time To Ring Some Changes //

This old house is a-tumbling down
The walls are gone but the roof is sound
The landlord's deaf, he can never be found
It's time to ring some changes

They'll arrest you son if you just stand still
They'll ask you to pose with your hand in the till
They'll ask you to die when you've written your will
It's time to ring some changes

It's time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes

O the politicians they look so smug
You say tell the truth and they give you a shrug
You might find the truth swept under the rug
It's time to ring some changes

You pay for your money for your daily bread
But the bread's gone up so you need more money
The money's gone down, better borrow instead
It's time to ring some changes

Time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes
Time to ring some changes

O you fall in love with the girl you've seen
Diamond studded on a TV screen
But the change in your pocket won't buy you a dream
It's time to ring some changes

So you steal a car and you go for a ride
You end up sleeping with some girl guide
And everything you do leaves you empty inside
It's time to ring some change

Time to ring some changes...

// Woman Or A Man? //

I stepped on the dance floor feeling very cool
I thought I saw an angel sitting on a stool
I just couldn't tell, you'll think I'm a fool
If she was a woman or a man

She was the kind of woman that a man could crave
From her high-heeled shoes to her permanent wave
Except maybe she was needing a shave
Was she a woman or a man?

O I asked her to dance and I took her by the hand
She held me so tight, it was hard for me to stand
Built like a lumberjack, I couldn't understand
If she was a woman or a man

Well, I walked her home, it was quarter past four
My heart was thumping as we ducked in the door
And then when she kissed me I thought I was sure
If she was a woman or a man

Well, she stole my wallet and she knocked me off my feet
She tied on her roller skates and made her retreat
All I found was a blond wig a-lying in the street
Was she a woman or a man?

Well, I don't care if she seemed unkind
She stole my heart and she robbed me blind
I love her so much that I still wouldn't mind
If she was a woman or a man

// Genesis Hall //

My father he rides with your sheriffs
And I know he would never mean harm
But to see both sides of a quarrel
Is to judge without hate or alarm

Oh, oh, helpless and slow
And you don't have anywhere to go

You take away homes from the homeless
And leave them to die in the cold
The gypsy who begs for your presents
He will laugh in your face when you're old

Oh, oh, helpless and slow
And you don't have anywhere to go

Well one man he drinks up his whiskey
Another he drinks up his wine
And they'll drink till their eyes are red with hate
For those of a different kind

Oh, oh, helpless and slow
And you don't have anywhere to go

When the rivers run thicker than trouble
I'll be there at your side in the flood
T'was all I could do to keep myself
From taking revenge on your blood

Oh, oh, helpless and slow
And you don't have anywhere to go
Oh, oh, helpless and slow
And you don't have anywhere to go

// Honky Tonk Blues //

Well I left my home down on the rural route
I told my paw I'm going steppin out and get the
Honky tonk blues
Yeah the honky tonk blues
Well lord I got 'em
I got the honky tonk blues

Well I went to a dance and I wore out my shoes
Woke up this mornin wishin I could lose
Them jumpin' honky tonk blues
Yeah the honky tonk blues
Well lord I got 'em
I got the honky tonk blues

Well I stopped into every place in town
This city life has really got me down
I got the honky tonk blues
Yeah the honky tonk blues
Well lord I got em
Got the honky tonk blues

I'm gonna tuck my worries underneath my arm
And scat right back to my pappy's farm
And leave these honky tonk blues
Yeah the honky tonk blues
Well lord I got 'em
I got the honky tonk blues

// Small Town Romance //

Small town romance
Back seat for a bed
Nothings must be whispered
Rumours must be fed

Small town romance
Everyone knows your mind
They peep from faded curtains
They read your valentines

O you got to get away
O you got to get away
O you got to get away
O they can't stand love in a small town

They knew you when you were weaning
They knew you when you were grown
They think they know all about you
They'll never leave you alone

Small town romance
There's too many jealousies
Old maids with long gone lovers
Old flames with bad memories

O you better get away
O you better get away
O you better get away
O they can't stand love in a small town

Midnight packing and leaving
Note pinned upon the sheets
Tail lights off in the distance
A ride through the painted streets

O small town romance
They'd still break you if they could
They'd always say I told you so
She never was no good

See she never loved him anyway
See she never loved him anyway
See she never loved him anyway
O you can't have love in a small town

See she never loved him anyway
See she never loved him anyway
See she never loved him anyway
O you can't have love in a small town

// Love Is Bad For Business //

What time of day is this? O you really look a mess
Clean down the tables and help out on the door
It's just no good to me if you're in ecstasy
Running all night with that boyfriend of yours

Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Empties the tills and it don't pay the bills
It'll do you no good
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Runs down your stocks and it leaves you on
The rocks

It'll do you no good

You better wipe that Mona Lisa smile off your face
Clean up those broken dishes, scrub down the floor
Wipe the stars out of your eyes, there's a job to do
And you've been dreaming for three weeks or more

Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Drives you insane but you're doing it again
It'll do you no good
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Pawn everything just to buy her a ring
It'll do you no good

Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Empties the tills and it don't pay the bills
It'll do you no good
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Runs down your stocks and it leaves you on the rocks
It'll do you no good

Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business
Love is bad for business

// How Many Times //

You broke my heart so many times
I can't count the pieces
Everytime you push me down
It seems my strength increases
How many times do you have to cry
While people stand there gawking
How many times do you have to fall
Before you end up walking

I tried to give you all I had
To prove that I'm not bluffing
They say it's a man with nothing to lose
Who ends up losing nothing
My head's full of scheming schemes
My tongue's tied up with talking
How many times do you have to fall
Before you end up walking

I tried to give you all I had
I thought my love was strong
I thought that I could treat you right
How did I treat you wrong
O won't you even open the door
To see the wares I'm hawking
How many times do you have to fall
Before you end up walking

O won't you give me one more chance
I couldn't do no worse
Empty out my heart for you
Before it has to burst
I'm too hungry not to win
But you're the game I'm stalking
How many times do you have to fall
Before you end up walking

// Meet On The Ledge //

We used to say "There'd come the day we'd all be making songs
Or finding better words" These ideas never lasted long

The way is up along the road, the air is growing thin
Too many friends who tried, blown off this mountain with the wind

Meet on the ledge, we're going to meet on the ledge
When my time is up, I'm going to see all my friends
Meet on the ledge, we're going to meet on the ledge
If you really mean it, it all comes around again

Yet now I see, I'm all alone, but that's the only way to be
You'll have your chance again, then you can do the work for me

Meet on the ledge, we're going to meet on the ledge
When my time is up, I'm going to see all my friends
Meet on the ledge, we're going to meet on the ledge
If you really mean it, it all comes around again

Meet on the ledge, we're going to meet on the ledge
When my time is up, I'm going to see all my friends
Meet on the ledge, we're going to meet on the ledge
If you really mean it, it all comes around again
