(Why I go easy?)
(Know why I go easy)
Wait

King of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland
King of the filthy, king of the fallen, we livin' again
King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin'
King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin'
King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed
King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect
King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it
King of the winner's district and geniuses with conviction
King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated
King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken
King of the empathy, your resentment, king of remorse
King of my enemies, may they fall defeat, I rejoice
King of the skyscrapers, dodgin' haters, broke religion
Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision
I embrace them with collision, kings did it
King's vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick, all hail the king!
I dropped a million tears
I know several responsibilities put me here
I don't pedal backwards, but I live old-fashioned
The lens that I'm lookin' through
Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free
Ashes I'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas
Sisters and brothers in unison, not because of me
Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace
But still'd fuck up your organization if any beef
What do you stand for?
Are you a activist? What are your city plans for?
Are you a accident? Are you just in the way?
Your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say
Are you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'?
Are you a king or you smokin' bowl rocks to keep you open?
Because the king don't cry, king don't die
King don't lie, king give all, king get by, king don't fall
Kingdom come, when I come, you know why
(King, king, king, king)
I am T'Challa!

Bought a coupe with the spinning rims, get inside
Bring a friend, bleeding hands from the genocide
Clean me up, beam me up to the other side
Brothers die, 'cause coons turn to butterflies
They don't wanna see me sittin' in the Benz
They don't wanna see me livin' on the end
Of the city in a city wide bend
Show no pity in the city for the sin
They don't wanna see me gettin' to the check
They just wanna see me swimming in the debt
Don't drown on ground wait until you hear

When I flex them tendons like rubber trees
Young Millie Jackson back to the shit
Mouth piece drawn, got a verbal armory
Stack bodies not figurines
Move beneath the surface, submarine
I'm half machine, obscene with a light sword
Look inside the brain, it's a ride in the psych ward
What you standing on the side for?
Roar like a lioness, punch like a cyborg
Spit slick, attack is subliminal
Flowers on my mind, but the rhyme style sinister
Stand behind my own bars, like a seasoned criminal
Gotham city streets I'll blame the [*censored*]
Crushing any system, that belittles us
Antidote to every poison they administer
Switch it like time signatures
Colours in my aura tend cover the perimeter
Brown bodies that the blues wanna shoot through
Hi-rez lasers wanna (zoom, zoom, zoom)
Roll over your eyes
My strength ain't nothing like my size
Blades on the top, Kathleen Cleaver
Tangle my chords like a weaver

Fo' sho man down, mando
Thank God I never had to knock your partner off
Or be an another casualty of war, Amen
There's 4 footprints in the sand where I walk
I never claimed to be a saint at all
Four Russians trippin' with hollow tips
And a kalashnikov, ain't that ya'll
No, Soulo hoe, kept it clean
Riding dirty jury would have gave me thirty
Herby love buggin' out, hit the target blindfolded
Electorial college devoted
To hit the score, to write the score that's not a metaphor
Raging against the machinery, taping up the scenery
You gotta keep the piece, to keep the peace
Got dough, squad up and mopped the block up for a cleaning fee

Bought an '83 Cutlass for the weekend (for the weekend)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like, we like
Fast cars, fast money, fast life, fast broads
Egotistic, goin' ballistic, why God?
Born warrior, lookin' for euphoria, but I don't see it
I don't feel it, I'm paraplegic
Tapped in when I'm maxed in
Compound with the MAC 10s and the pumps in the background
I was absent, never OG, standout
I was lackin' everything else but doubt
In the Magnum, holding Magnums with a Magnum
Nigga, ad-lib and I sing out loud
Never had friends, never had ends, never had hope
They was like, "Nope," I was like, "Boo yaow, boo yaow"
Yeah, God
Tee off the day, know we off the, be off the
Eat off your plate, throw me off, I be, "Off ya head"
Well ate, on C4, I'm way off the edge
Fuck integrity, fuck your pedigree
Fuck your feelings, fuck your culture
Fuck your mom, fuck your family, fuck your drive
Fuck your land, fuck your children, fuck your wives
Who am I? Not your father, not your brother
Not your reason, not your future
Not your comfort, not your reverence, not your glory
Not your heaven and not your angel, not your spirit
Not your message, not your freedom
Not your people, not your neighbor
Not your baby, not your equal
Not the title y'all want me under
All hail King Killmonger
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light, they like, we like
Fast cars

I cry with lil' brotha, got high and watched the sunrise
Wiggle on 'em if it's One Time they done hung all of my people
I love all of my people, I'm in the slums with all of my people
They trynna tell us that we all equal
We gettin' no justice so it ain't peaceful
Think they bluffin' they ain't gon' beat you
Paid attorney we gon' need it
Momma told me there was demons, she ain't never lied on her G
She worked her ass off just to feed us, she went to Ross to cop the new Adidas
She used to tap in with all the teachers, they wasn't teaching nothin' it wasn't no secret
Whole lotta grind, lil' niggas beefin', we gotta keep it or end up a victim
Trapped in the system, trafficking drugs, modern day slavery, African thugs
We go to war with this African blood, We go to war with this African blood
When I put niggas on it was all out of love
You was disloyal can't call it no love

Look my nigga I came from the sewer, don't shit on my past you ain't come from manure
You see Reason and you see LA, but bitch I ain't come for no ruin
Just know all of my niggas we struggled for it, had to hustle for it, cried puddles for it
My pops watch my sister get locked for it
I done seen my niggas get popped for it like (pop!)
Gimme that, I carry the llama like a piggyback
I carry my city like guilt that ain't got no forgiveness
No way out, shit we locked in the system
Catch a case and they not gon' forgive ya
White skin you be out 'fore Christmas
Shit, auntie missed eight of those days
Tears from me had to pray those days, had to slave those days
Shit, we had to hit up a couple hood-give-aways those days
Thank God for every inch that he gave us
Thank God for everything 'cause he made us
Like when that car bent the block, brock, brock, brock
Hit the homie but we made it, he already saved us
Thinkin' that he could've died nigga, we as praying to the sky and his mother cried rivers
Healed up, but tough luck, he tried to get revenge, had to drop but his popped and they killed him
Worst part is that it sound so familiar

I am Killmonger

I'm always ready to take a life again (That life again)
You know I'll ride again (I'll ride again)
It's all the same (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me who's gon' save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
Without you, I'm all alone

Take my pain for me? (Take my pain for me?)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption, the souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be
Sacrificed for the greater good then that's what it gotta be

[The Weeknd:]
Who gon' pray for me? (Who gon' pray for me?)
Take my pain for me? (Take my pain for me?)
