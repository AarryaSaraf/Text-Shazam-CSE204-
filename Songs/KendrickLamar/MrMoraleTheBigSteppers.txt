// United In Grief //

I hope you find some peace of mind in this lifetime
(Tell them, tell 'em, tell them the truth)
I hope you find some paradise
(Tell 'em, tell 'em the truth)
(Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em your—)
I've been goin' through somethin'
One-thousand eight-hundred and fifty-five days
I've been goin' through somethin'
Be afraid

What is a bitch in a miniskirt?
A man in his feelings with bitter nerve
What is a woman that really hurt?
A demon, you're better off killing her
What is a relative making repetitive narratives
On how you did it first?
That is a predator, hit reverse
All of your presidents' evil thirst
What is a neighborhood rep'table?
That is a snitch on a pedestal
What is a house with a better view?
A family broken in variables
What is a rapper with jewelry?
A way that I show my maturity
What if I call on security?
That mean I'm calling on God for purity
I went and got me a therapist
I can debate on my theories and sharing it (Woah)
Consolidate all my comparisons
Humblin' up because time was imperative (Woah)
Started to feel like it's only one answer
To everything, I don't know where it is (Woah)
Popping a bottle of Claritin (Woah)
Is it my head or my arrogance? (Woah)
Shaking and moving, like, what am I doing?
I'm flipping my time through the Rolodex
Indulging myself and my life and my music
The world that I'm in is a cul-de-sac
The world that we in is just menacing
The demons portrayed as religionous
I wake in the morning, another appointment
I hope the psychologist listenin'

The new Mercedes with black G-Wagon
The "Where you from?", it was all for rap
I was 28 years young, twenty mill' in tax
Bought a couple of mansions, just for practice
Five hundred in jewelry, chain was magic
Never had it in public, late reaction
50K to cousins, post a caption
Pray none of my enemies hold me captive

I grieve different
I grieve different (Huh)

I met her on the third night of Chicago
North America tour, my enclave
Fee-fi-fo-fum, she was a model
Dedicated to the songs I wrote and the Bible
Eyes like green penetratin' the moonlight
Hair done in a bun, energy in the room like
Big Bang for theory, God, hopin' you hear me
Phone off the ringer, tell the world, "I'm busy"
Fair enough, green eyes said her mother didn't care enough
Sympathize when her daddy in the chain gang
Her first brother got killed, he was twenty-one
I was nine when they put Lamont in the grave
Heartbroken when Estelle didn't say goodbye
Chad left his body after we FaceTimed
Green eyes said you'd be okay, first tour, sex the pain away

I grieve different
I grieve different (Huh)

The new Mercedes with black G-Wagon
The "Where you from?", it was all for rap
I was 28 years young, twenty mill' in tax
Bought a couple of mansions, just for practice
Five hundred in jewelry, chain was magic
Never had it in public, late reaction
50K to cousins, post a caption
Pray none of my enemies hold me captive

So what, paralyzed, the county building controlled us
I bought a Rolex watch, I only wore it once
I bought infinity pools I never swimmed in
I watched Keem buy four cars in four months
You know the family dynamics on repeat
The insecurities locked down on PC
I bought a .223, nobody peace treat
You won't doo-doo me, I smell TNT
Dave got him a Porsche, so I got me a Porsche
Paid lottery for it, I ain't want it in portions
Poverty was the case
But the money wipin' the tears away

I grieve different
(Everybody grieves different)
(Everybody grieves different)
I grieve different (Huh)

// N95 //

Hello, new world, all the boys and girls
I got some true stories to tell
You're back outside, but they still lied
Woah-oh-oh-oh (Yeah)

Take off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi
Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
Take off the weird-ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I'm taking off top five
Take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside (Take that shit off)
Take off your idols, take off the runway, I take off to Cairo (Take that shit off)
Take off to Saint-Tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mill', hell, if I know (Take that shit off)
Take off the front flag, take off perception, take off the cop with the eye patch (Take that shit off)
Take off the unloyal, take off the unsure, take off decisions I lack (Take it off)
Take off the fake deep, take off the fake woke, take off the, "I'm broke, I care" (Take it off)
Take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if I'm rich, I'm rare (Take it off)
Take off the Chanel, take off the Dolce, take off the Birkin bag
(Take it off)
Take all that designer bullshit off, and what do you have?

Bitch, huh, huh, ugh
You ugly as fuck (You outta pocket)
Huh, two ATMs (Hah, hah, hah, hah)
You steppin' or what? (You outta pocket, huh)
Who you think they talk about?
Talk about us (You outta pocket—shoot, shoot, shoot)
Who you think they copy off? (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
Copy off us (Get back in pocket)

The world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on a run
The prophets abandoned, the law take advantage, the market is crashin', the industry wants
Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box while they makin' a mockery followin' us
This ain't Monopoly, watchin' for love, this ain't monogamy, y'all gettin' fucked
Jumpin' on what the hell is that? I gotta relax when I feel (Huh, facts)
All my descendants, they come in my sleep and say I am too real (Huh, facts)
I'm done with the sensitive, takin' it personal, done with the black and the white, the wrong and the right
You hopin' for change and clericals, I know the feelings that came with burial's cries

Bitch, huh, huh, ugh
You ugly as fuck (You outta pocket)
Huh, two ATMs (Hah, hah, hah, hah)
You steppin' or what? (You outta pocket, huh)
Who you think they talk about?
Talk about us (You outta pocket—shoot, shoot, shoot)
Who you think they copy off? (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
Copy off us

Servin' up a look, dancin' in a drought
Hello to the big stepper, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house
Ventin' in the sa—

Can I vent all my truth? I got nothin' to lose, I got problems and pools, I can swim on my faith
Cameras movin' whenever I'm movin', the family suin' whatever I make
Murder is stackin', the president actin', the government taxin' my funds in the bank
Homies attracting the feds when I'm bracking, look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (Hold up, hold up)
Let's think about this for a second (Let's go)
Tell me what you would do for aesthetic (Let's go)
Would you sell your soul on credit? (Let's go)
Would you sell your bro for leverage? (Let's go)
Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant? (Let's go)
Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant? (Let's go)

Huh, huh, ugh
You outta pocket, yeah, you outta pocket (This shit hard)
You entertain the mediocre, need to stop it (This shit hard)
You entertainin' old friends when they toxic (This shit hard)
What your life like? Bullshit and gossip (This shit hard)
What the fuck is cancel culture, dawg?
Say what I want about you niggas, I'm like Oprah, dawg
I treat you crackers like I'm Jigga, watch, I own it all
Oh, you worried 'bout a critic? That ain't protocol (Bitch)

// Worldwide Steppers //

Kodak Black, Oklama
Eckhart Tolle
And this here is the big stepper

I'm a killer, he's a killer, she's a killer, bitch
We some killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch
Germophobic, hetero and—

I am not for the faint of heart
My genetic build can build multi-universes, the man of God
Playin' "Baby Shark" with my daughter
Watchin' for sharks outside at the same time
Life as a protective father, I'd kill for her
My son Enoch is the part two
When I expire, my children'll make higher valleys
In this present moment, I saw that through
Ask Whitney about my lust addiction
Text messagin' bitches got my thumbs hurt
Set precedent for a new sacrilegion
Writer's block for two years, nothin' moved me
Asked God to speak through me, that's what you hearin' now
The voice of yours truly
Teleport out my own body for comfort
I don't pass judgment, past life regressions keep me in question
Where did I come from? I don't think like I used to
No, I don't blink like I used to
Awkward stares at everybody, see the flesh of man
But still, this man compared to nobody
Yesterday, I prayed to the flowers and trees
Gratification to the powers that be
Synchronization with my energy chakras, the ghost of Dr. Sebi
Paid it forward, cleaned out my toxins, bacteria heavy
Sciatica nerve pinch, I don't know how to feel
Like the first time I fucked a white bitch

The first time I fucked a white bitch
I was sixteen at the Palisades
Fumblin' my grades, I traveled with the team
The Apache life, Centennial was like
When Mrs. Baker screamed at Doughboy
Mixed that with Purple Rain
They interchanged the scenes
Happy just to be out the hood
With all the wealthy kids
Credit cards and family plans
She drove her daddy's Benz
I found out that he was a sheriff
That was a win-win
Because he had locked up Uncle Perry
She paid her daddy's sins
Next time I fucked a white bitch
Was out in Copenhagen
Good kid, m.A.A.d city tour
I flourished on them stages
Whitney asked did I have a problem
I said, "I might be racist"
Ancestors watchin' me fuck was like retaliation

I'm a killer, he's a killer, she's a killer, bitch
We some killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch
Germophobic, hetero and homophobic
Photoshoppin' lies and motives
Hide your eyes, then pose for the pic

What the—

Eight billion people on Earth, silent murderers
Non-profits, preachers and church, crooks and burglars (Woo)
Hollywood corporate in school, teachin' philosophies
You either gon' be dead or in jail, killer psychology
Silent murderer, what's your body count? Who your sponsorship?
Objectified so many bitches, I killed their confidence (What the—)
The media's the new religion, you killed the consciousness
(What the fuck?)
Your jealousy is way too pretentious, you killed accomplishments (What the fuck?)
Niggas killed freedom of speech, everyone sensitive (What the fuck?)
If your opinion fuck 'round and leak, might as well send your will (What the—)
The industry has killed the creators, I'll be the first to say (What the fuck?)
To each exec', "I'm saving your children"—We can't negotiate (What the—)
I caught a couple of bodies myself, slid my community
My last Christmas toy drive in Compton handed out eulogies
Not because the rags in the park had red gradient
But because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin'
So what's the difference 'tween your life when hiding motives?
More fatalities and reality bring you closure
The noble person that goes to work and pray like they 'posed to?
Slaughter people too, your murder's just a bit slower


I'm a killer, he's a killer, she's a killer, bitch
(What the fuck?)
We some killers, walkin' zombies, tryna scratch that itch
(What the—)
Germophobic, hetero and homophobic
Photoshoppin' lies and motives
Hide your eyes, then pose for the pic'

I wonder where I lost my way
Mmm, ah-ah
Been waiting on your call all day
Tell me you in my corner right now
When I fall short, I'm leaning on you to cry out
We all got enough to lie about
My truth too complicated to hide now
Can I open up? Is it safe or not?
I'm afraid a little, you relate or not?
Have faith a little, I might take my time
Ain't no saving face this time

But my past won't keep me from my best (I-I-I, yeah, yeah)
Subtle mistakes felt like life or death (I-I-I, yeah, yeah)
I wanna see the family stronger
I wanna see the money longer
You know that I'd die for you (I'd die for you)
I get emotional about life
The lost ones keepin' me up at night
The world be reminding me it's danger
I'll still risk it all for a stranger
If I told you who I am, would you use it against me?
Right or wrong, no stone, just love to send me

[Blxst:]
I hope I'm not too late to set my demons straight
I know I made you wait, but how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me, I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me, yeah

Baby, you make me pray for London
Yeah, 'cause if I won it all without you involved (Fucking love you)
I guess it's all for nothing

You really need some therapy
Real nigga need no therapy, fuck you talkin' about?
Nah, nah, you sound stupid as fuck
Shit, everybody stupid
Yeah, well, you need to talk to somebody
Reach out to Eckhart

I come from a generation of home invasions and I got daddy issues, that's on me
Everything them four walls had taught me, made habits bury deep
That man knew a lot, but not enough to keep me past them streets
My life is a plot, twisted from directions that I can't see
Daddy issues ball across my head, told me, "Fuck a foul"
I'm teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won't think out loud
A foolish pride, if I lose again, won't go in the house
I stayed outside, laughin' with my friends, they don't know my life
Daddy issues made me learn losses, I don't take those well
Momma said, "That boy is exhausted," he said, "Go fuck yourself
If he give up now, that's gon' cost him, life's a bitch
You could be a bitch or step out the margin," I got up quick
I'm chargin' baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance
Oh, this the part where mental stability meets talent
Oh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice
Tactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues

Early mornin' wake-ups (Ah), practicin' on day-offs (Ah)
Tough love (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah)
Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser (Ah)
Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chase
Early mornin' wake-ups (Ah), practicin' on day-offs (Ah, day-offs)
Tough love (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah)
Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser (Ah)
Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser

I got daddy issues, that's on me
Lookin' for, "I love you", rarely empathizin' for my relief
A child that grew accustomed, jumping up when I scraped my knee
'Cause if I cried about it, he'd surely tell me not to be weak
Daddy issues, hid my emotions, never expressed myself
Men should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped
His momma died, I asked him why he goin' back to work so soon?
His first reply was, "Son, that's life, the bills got no silver spoon"
Daddy issues, fuck everybody, go get your money, son
Protect yourself, trust nobody, only your momma'n'em
This made relationships seem cloudy, never attached to none
So if you took some likings around me, I might reject the love
Daddy issues kept me competitive, that's a fact, nigga
I don't give a fuck what's the narrative, I am that nigga
When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused
Guess I'm not mature as I think, got some healin' to do
Egotistic, zero-given fucks and to be specific (Ah)
Need assistance with the way I was brought up (Ah, ah)
What's the difference when your heart is made of stone
And your mind is made of gold
And your tongue is made of sword, but it may weaken your soul?
My niggas ain't got no daddy, grow up overcompensatin'
Learn shit 'bout bein' a man and disguise it as bein' gangsta
I love my father for tellin' me to take off the gloves
'Cause everything he didn't want was everything I was
And to my partners that figured it out without a father
I salute you, may your blessings be neutral to your toddlers
It's crucial, they can't stop us if we see the mistakes
'Til then, let's give the women a break, grown men with daddy issues

Early mornin' wake-ups (Ah), practicin' on day-offs (Ah, day-offs)
Tough love (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah)
Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser (Ah)
Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser

// Rich (Interlude) //

I learned in trappin', in the business
Smart people makin' horrible decisions, you know?
Rich nigga, gettin' my dick sucked after the show
I ain't gon' lie, we were poor
A bunch of lost souls in survival mode
It wasn't no way for us unless we found our own
Runnin' in stores, kickin' in doors, nigga, give me my glory
Nigga play with me, he ain't gon' live to tell the story
You know, this the type of shit we glorify, everybody gang-gang
Most of the people that you grew up with are now in the chain gang
In the box, gettin' pink
Niggas shittin' where you sleep
Niggas shittin' where you eat
Who'da ever knew that I'd become a fuckin' Kodak? Yeah
Rap money good, but I'm still pumpin' gas through the hood
Droppin' off plates to the fam' like Thanksgivin'
Got the baby snipers standin' on that murk business, yeah, slidin' for Yak
They ready for whatever
I always knew that everything would get better
And it sho' got greater later
All the game came from the elders like hand-me-downs
Me and my brothers wearin' hand-me-downs
Now I'm givin' game back to the old heads
And the respect come first, yeah, you know?
Can't be better than the OGs, you gotta get it somewhere
Gotta come from somethin', God don't come from nothin'
We ain't seen this comin', nigga, it's more than a blessin'
What you doing with Kendrick? (Ooh, ooh)
What you doing with a legend? (Ooh, ooh)
So what they call you? (Ooh, ooh)
When it's all said and done, we ain't leavin' empty-handed (Ooh, ooh)
That's on gang (Ooh, ooh)
That's on Ma' Dukes (Ooh, ooh)
Poorer than that bitch but she fall through (Ooh, ooh)
Makin' ends meet (Ooh, ooh), daddy deadbeat (Ooh, ooh)
Had to steal for a meal or you can't eat, you know? (Ooh, ooh)
Poverty (Ooh, ooh)
Red Cross, food banks, W.I.C. (Ooh, ooh)
Now look at this shit, we own property

Takin' my baby to school, then I pray for her
'Cause you bitches ain't never been cool, writin' testament
Paintin' pictures, put me in the Louvre, that's a definite
Universal shift, I'm in a groove
And celebrity do not mean integrity, you fool
I'm a good man, shake your hand, firm grip rule
Seventy-two wins, lost ten, ballin' with the flu
More than two M's for a show, but add another two
Hmm, lil' Man-Man, the big mans

The morality can wait, feedback on low latency, I'm glitching from the face
As my thoughts grow sacredly, I'm runnin' out of space
Ask Whitney, she okay, never mind a hundred K
Why you lyin' on Benjamin? He turnin' in his grave
I'd be lyin' if I said I wouldn't give this shit away

I would never live my life on a computer
IG'll get you life for a chikabooya
More power to ya, love 'em from a distance
Why you always in the mirror more than the bitches?
And my cousin tried to sue me like he got the privilege
But I didn't lose sleep 'cause I got the spirit, ayy (Ooh)

Lost friends, family, gained more enemies 'cause of you
Bitches starin' at me in Zara, hoes scratchin' my cars up
Shoulda followed my mind in '09 and just moved to Georgia
Oh, what, that's my fault now? Bitch, you power trippin' or guilt trippin'? (Okay)
I held your ass down
You just kept me down, that's a big difference
Stressin' myself tryna figure why I'm not good enough
Goin' to church, prayin' for you, searchin' for good in us
Lil' dick-ass nigga that's tryna go big

Shoulda thought about cuffin' you, bitch
Nigga, you dirty and you broke
Ho, you goofy and gullible, fuck you talkin' 'bout?

You the reason, we overlooked, underpaid, under-booked, under shame
If you look, I don't speak, then I'm called on my name (Hah...)
I am flawed, I am pained, never yours, I remained (Come on, bro)
You the reason bitches start fuckin' with bitches when they change
You the reason bitches start callin' y'all bitches 'cause y'all useless
You the reason Harvey Weinstein had to see his conclusion
You the reason R. Kelly can't recognize that he's abusive
Man, shut the fuck up, we all know you still playin' his music
Said I'm tired of these emotional-ass, ungrateful-ass bitches
Fake innocent, fake feminist, stop pretendin'
Y'all sentiments ain't realer than what you defendin'
(Here he go, shut the fuck up)
It's a split decision, broads like you and real victims (Look at you, look at you)
Let's talk the truth (Okay), women in general just can't get along (Explain, nigga)
Hmm, when Tash got a man, you didn't pick up the phone (Explain, nigga)
Uh-uh, when Nate got a job, you said you stayin' home (Explain)
Oh, why R&B bitches don't feature on each other songs then?
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Never mind, bitch, I'm walkin' out
Whatever, nigga, I'm off you now
Yo' evil ass kept me well in doubt
Pussy nigga, best watch your mouth
Pussy and mouth is all you got
Lay this pussy back on the couch
Doggie style, then you get on top

Fuck me, nigga (I'ma fuck you, bitch)
Nah, fuck me, nigga, fuck me (I'ma fuck you, bitch)
Nah, fuck you, fuck me (You playin' man)
Fuck me
Nah, you playin'

Stop tap-dancing around the conversation

// Purple Hearts //

Mmm, tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin', hmm
Rollin' sevens, I ain't ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
If God be the source then I am the plug talkin'
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby

This my undisputed truth, uh-huh
My life is like forbidden fruit, my bitch know better than I do
A woman's worth, I barely went to church, I'd rather fast with you
Than fuck it up, fucking with skirts 'cause I'm rational
A nigga still gon' be a nigga, emoji heart, my family pictures
Two-steppin' away from rappers, I don't trust their true intentions
I'm not in the music business, I been in the human business
Whole life been social distant, hoes like, "When you not trippin'?"
I duck the party, who said they saw me?
Crown on Bob Marley, wrist on Yo Gotti
They gon' judge your life for a couple likes on the double tap
Them hoes is sorry, they all get bodied
I bless it that you have an open heart, I bless that you forgive
I bless it that you can learn from a loss, I bless it that you heal
I bless one day that you attract somebody with your mind exact
A patient life, flaws, bless 'em twice, and they'll bless you back

Tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin', hmm
Rollin' sevens, I ain't ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
If God be the source, then I am the plug talkin'
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, yeah

(How's love) How's love when it's heart to your soul?
But my nigga left, his ass on the road
Gossiping 'bout some shit you don't know
Oh, you ho (Yeah, yeah, yeah, fasho)
I hate it here, baby daddy still on my phone
I hate it here, asking if I been on the pole
I hate it here, if you keep lurking on the low
If you a fan, just let me know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Now if it's love, I deserve to get some head on a balcony sometimes, sometimes
And if I feel where your heart can be, you'll still be a part of me
I love mine, love mine (Love mine, love mine)
Summer in the storm, I cannot conform
(I cannot conform, I cannot conform)
I just might love you still, just think I love me more
It ain't love if you gon' judge me for my past
No, it ain't love if you ain't never eat my ass
It ain't love if you just only tie me down because you seen me in my bag
That's why I'm anti-everyone before this mask

Mmm, tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin', hmm
Rollin' sevens, I ain't ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
If God be the source, then I am the plug talkin'
Yeah, baby, yeah, baby
Yeah, baby, yeah

Yo, yo
Telekinesis, I'm purifying these D speeches
While I'm crying, I clean the feet of the sweet Jesus
Dreams, visions get blurry of the Elohim, it's light
It's known to tear retinas in a single gleam
Shut the fuck up when you hear His love talkin'
To the mind, it's God's cypher divine in a small portion, uh
Faded pictures, this global madness, the intervention
This world's in The Twilight Zone, this is the fifth dimension
God, please blow the whistle, we need an intermission
My good deeds in front of your door, I'm standing by the entrance
With heavy baggage, my brother's ashes
I seen tragic, I did dirt, smacked death and held it to that nigga cabbage
Love, we killin' greed, we killin' homelessness
And I don't give a fuck about this land, I want ownership
Bow your head for just God's sake
Listen what the stars say when I say it's God's way

Tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin', hmm
Rollin' sevens, I ain't ready for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'
If God be the source, then I am the plug talkin'

// Count Me Out //

We may not know which way to go on this dark road
(Mr. Duckworth)
All of these hoes make it difficult
Session 10, breakthrough

One of these lives, I'ma make things right
With the wrongs I've done, that's when I unite
With the Father, Son, 'til then, I fight
Rain on me, put the blame on me
Got guilt, got hurt, got shame on me
Got six magazines that's aimed at me
Done every magazine, what's fame to me?
(And I'm tripping and falling)
It's a game to me, where the bedroom at?
Sleep, I ain't never had affairs with that
What's fair when the hearts and the words don't reach?
What's fair when the money don't take things back?
It's rare when somebody take your dreams back
(And I'm tripping and falling)
I care too much, wanna share too much, in my head too much
I shut down too, I ain't there too much
I'm a complex soul, they layered me up
Then broke me down, and morality's dust, I lack in trust
(And I'm tripping and falling)
This time around, I trust myself
Please everybody else but myself
All else fails, I was myself
Outdone fear, outdone myself
This year, you better one yourself
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Masks on the babies, mask on an opp
Wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop
But a mask won't hide who you are inside
Look around, the reality's carved in lies
Wipe my ego, dodge my pride
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Look myself in the mirror
Amityville, ain't seen nothin' scarier
I fought like a pitbull terrier
Blood I shed could fill up aquariums
Tell all my angels, "Carry 'em"
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Every emotion been deprived
Even my strong points couldn't survive
If I didn't learn to love myself, forgive myself a hundred times, dawg

I love when you count me out (Huh)
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
(Wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)
I love when you count me out
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up
How you gon' win my trust when the lies run deep? (Wah, woo, wah)
How you gon' bend your love when the bad don't sleep? (Sheesh)
Beep, beep, crash our feelings in the middle of the street (Vroom, vroom)

Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (Huh, huh)

When you was at your lowest, tell me where the hoes was at?
When you was at your lowest, tell me where the bros was at?
Three-thirty in the mornin', scroll through the call log (Huh, huh, huh, huh)
Ain't nobody but the mirror lookin' for the fall off (Brrrt)

I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
(Wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)
My name is in your mouth, shoo, shoo
It's gon' take more than pride to stop me
Call 9-1-1, I caught a body
Sun up now, and yesterday is fadin'
Healing's only 'bout a mile away
Let me tell you 'bout the woman I know (That's my baby)
I know karma like to follow us strong (Sheesh)
I know millionaires that feel alone (Sheesh)
Anytime I couldn't find God, I still could find myself through a song
Many find they life in a phone

Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up

You said I'd feel better if I just worked hard without liftin' my head up
That left me fed up
You made me worry
I wanted my best version, but you ignored me
Then changed the story, then changed the story
Good energy in the room, drop the location, please
Antibiotic for the womb when I'm frustrated, please
(Antibiotic for the womb when I'm frustrated)
Tryna keep my good conscience in rotation
Thoughts in my head, they livin' there with no— (Tryna keep my good)
I made a decision, never give you my feelings
Fuck with you from, fuck with you from a distance
Some put it on the Devil when they fall short
I put it on my ego, lord of all lords
Sometimes I fall for her, dawg

I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out (Sheesh)
I love when you count me out (Sheesh)
I love when you count me out (Wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)
My name is in your mouth

Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (True, true)

Miss Regrets, I believe that you done me wrong (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regrets, can you please exit out my home? (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regret, I think I'm better off alone (Miss Regrets)
(Miss Regret) Miss Regret, I got these deep regrets
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Some things I can't forget
Lord knows, I tried my best
You said it's not my best
I came up out my flesh
Something's up, must confess (Ah, ya)
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Spoke my truth, paid my debt (Ah, ya)
Can't you see I'm a wreck? (Ah, ya)
Let me loose, I digress (Ah, ya)
This is me, and I'm blessed (Ah, ya)
This is me, and I'm blessed (Ah, ya)

// Crown //

You walk around like everything is in control
Favor come with favors and you can't say no
Go out the way to make the coin available
That's what I call love
The closest ones afraid to say they need some time
The turnaround is life or death, but you don't mind
Go out the way to say you made the compromise
That's what I call love

But the time it'll come to not be there when somebody needs you
You say no and all you've done gives them amnesia
One thing I've learned, love can change with the seasons

And I can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
Wait, you can't please everybody
No, I can't please everybody
I can't please everybody

They idolize and praise your name across the nation
Tap the feet and nod the head for confirmation
Promise that you keep the music in rotation
That's what I call love (That's what I call love)

But the time it'll come (But the time it'll come)
To not be there when somebody needs you (When somebody needs you)
You say no and all you've done gives them amnesia (They don't remember)

[Kodak Black:]
They don't fuck with me even if they could
Pull out the stick, hit a bitch with the wood
First to park Rolls Royce, 'vert in the hood
Don't worry about us, over here we good
The AP Roman numeral, everywhere I go, I need pharmaceuticals
I ran my whole conglomerate, I was just mappin' shit out in the cubicle
Suicide coupe was a funeral, Trackhawk launch like a slingshot
Big ol' ruby diamond on my pinky finger, that bitch look like a Ring Pop
Money on my mind, money on your head
Can't ride three times while you comin' through the 'jects
Red Cross kept a nigga fed
In the studio with K. Dot fresh out the feds
Yeah, you niggas can't stand the rain, you niggas don't stand a chance
Yeah, Chevrolet candy paint, I spin the bend in the Benz
I caught a bale off a Google app
I'm the type to get my shooter whacked
I had to survive off a tuna pack
Five percent tint on the whip like, "Who was that?"
Coupe take off like it's mad
Beat the dope with a fork, I'm whippin' up Sudafed, I'm doin' scams in the lab
Every Thursday, girl's day, spendin' time with my daughter, make me go harder
Every Sunday's son's day, teach my boy to be a man, I ain't had no father
Fell in the love with the block, I ain't have no pop, just a sawed-off shotgun, Mossberg
We stackin' that money up proper, awkward diamonds, look like marbles
Audemars water, aqua, beatin' the block up 'til we spot 'em
I don't want your ice, boy, I want your life, but fuck it, I still might rob 'em

[Eckhart Tolle:]
If you derive your sense of identity from being a victim. Let's say, bad things were done to you when you were a child. And you develop a sense of self that is based on the bad things that happened to you.

[Baby Keem:]
You ever seen your mama strung out while you studied division?
Your uncle ever stole from you, day after Christmas?
Seen both of those in the county jail visits
The first and the fifteenth, the only religion
Noodles in the microwave, shark tank tidal wave
Grandma shootin' niggas, blood on the highway
Crosses on the dashboard, you just want a platform
I wanna take everything that I ask for
Catch me a body, I'll put that on anybody but my mama
She showin' a pattern for certain
I think it's white panties and minimal condoms
My uncle would tell me the shit in the movies could only be magic
This year, I did forty-three shows and took it all home to buy him a casket
Jack of all trades, got money out the way
Put my heart in the faith, I'm good, love
Cousin in the courts, heard he jumped off the porch
Turn a brick to a Porsche, I'm good, love
Catch us, you know I'm gon' rack up
I need the advance and the equity to match up
The engineer dead if the drive don't back up
These words come of God, you could never outrap us
Nowadays, gotta walk cautious, ayy
Nowadays, I'm a new prophet, ayy
Game dead, no autopsy, ayy
City girl with they new hobby, ayy
Catch a body, put the Prada in the ta-da
Nigga 'boutta get some pussy, give me five (Give me five)
Gun dirty, got the thirty in the purse, purse
Tight bitch, put a perky in her salad
I gotta pray for the basic
I never seen my niggas bust down faces
Them niggas not tasteless
I only had one chance, I ain't even waste it
Been down on my luck
Been down on my luck when I fa-a-all
I gotta get up
I gotta get back up and ba-a-a-all
R-I-P, under my people
I'm proud of my people, I'm proud of my dawgs
My ex got a beamer, she want me to see it
I still ain't gon' see it, like, okay
I love when they ratchet, I don't do her Patek
I still do the watches the old way
She think I'm conceited, I'm thinkin' 'bout cheatin'
I don't do the flowers or roleplay
Now, how can I fold lookin' at twenty million
This money don't come with a probate
Mama, I said it'd be okay

I got this shit brackin' in four days
Four eyes, four eyes, two eyes
Switch sides, nigga be fresh out
Suicide doors, I suicide, suicide
Lambo body, who gon' stop me?
Baby Keem is too wild
Function at the temple
Jesus pieces in the luau

Mr. Morale, give me high-five
Two times center codefendant judging my life
Back pedaler, what they say? You do the cha-cha
I'ma stand on it, 6'5" from 5'5"

I tell the whole truth from A to Z, ayy
Show me you real, show me that you bleed, ayy
Hello? Crackers? (Let me hear that back)
I seen niggas arguing about who's blacker
Even blacked out screens and called it solidarity (Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck)
Meditating in silence made you wanna tell on me (Fuck)

Bitch, are you happy for me?
Really, are you happy for me?
Smile in my face, but are you happy for me?
Yeah, I'm out the way, are you happy for me?
Bitch, are you happy for me?
Really, are you happy for me?
Smile in my face, but are you happy for me?
Yeah, I'm out the way, are you happy for me? (High up)

Bite they tongues in rap lyrics
Scared to be crucified about a song, but they won't admit it
Politically correct is how you keep an opinion
Niggas is tight-lipped, fuck who dare to be different
Seen a Christian say the vaccine mark of the beast
Then he caught COVID and prayed to Pfizer for relief
Then I caught COVID and started to question Kyrie
Will I stay organic or hurt in this bed for two weeks? (You really wanna know?)
Do you want peace? (How I get so low?)
Then watch us in the street (Only one way to go)
One protest for you (High up)
Three-sixty-five for me (You really wanna know?)
Vladimir making nightmares (How I get so low?)
But that's how we all think (Only one way to go)

Calamities on repeat, huh

Bitch, are you happy for me?
Really, are you happy for me?
Smile in my face, but are you happy for me?
Yeah, I'm out the way, are you happy for me?
Bitch, are you happy for me?
Really, are you happy for me?
Smile in my face, but are you happy for me?
Yeah, I'm out the way, are you happy for me?

Truth, it resides in the fire
The need of it's dire
Deceiving the lies, I know
Truth, it resides in the fire
The need of it's dire
Deceiving the lies, I know

The cat is out the bag, I am not your savior
I find it just as difficult to love thy neighbors
Especially when people got ambiguous favors
But they hearts not in it, see, everything's for the paper
The struggle for the right side of history
Independent thought is like an eternal enemy
Capitalists posing as compassionates be offending me
Yeah, suck my dick with authenticity
Yeah, Tupac dead, gotta think for yourself
Yeah, heroes looking for the villains to help
I never been sophisticated, saving face
Being manipulative, such an acquired taste
I rubbed elbows with people that was for the people
They all greedy, I don't care for no public speaking
And they like to wonder where I've been
Protecting my soul in the valley of silence

// Auntie Diaries //

Heart plays in ways the mind can't figure out
Heart plays in ways the mind can't—
Heart plays in ways the mind can't figure out
This is how we conceptualize human beings

My auntie is a man now
I think I'm old enough to understand now
Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Motorola pager, off-white Guess jacket
Blue Air Max's, gold chains, and curl kits
'93 Nissan wax job, the earliest
Big social, big personality, vocal
Played the underground verbatim and stayed local
My auntie is a man now
I watch him and his girl hold their hands down
Tip of the avenues under street lights made his
Thinking, "I want me a bad bitch when I get big"
They hug on the corner like California king
Cold hand all up her skirt, cars whistling down the road
See, my auntie is a man now, slight bravado
Scratching the likes from lotto
Hoping that she pull up tomorrow
So I can hang out in the front seat
Six by nines keeping the music up under me
My auntie is a man now
Asked my momma why my uncles don't like him that much
And at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much
She said, "Ain't no tellin'
Niggas always been jealous because he had more women
More money and more attention made more envy
Calling him anything but broke was less offending"

My auntie is a man now
I think I'm old enough to understand now
Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Back when it was comedic relief to say, "Faggot"
Faggot, faggot, faggot, we ain't know no better
Elementary kids with no filter, however
My auntie became a man and I took pride in it
She wasn't gay, she ate pussy, and that was the difference
That's what I told my friends in second grade
She picking me up from school, they stare at her in the face
They couldn't comprehend what I grew accustomed
We pull off bumpin' Quik like it was nothing
My auntie is a man now, what a relationship
I grew up fast, I needed no one to babysit
He gave me some cash then gave me some game
Cherry freshener on the dash, I never complained
She even cut my hair at the pad, was loving my fade
The first person I seen write a rap
That's when my life had changed
House full of demo, smoke stuck on the window
Cameras on the microphone, all women and men though
My auntie was a man now, we cool with it
The history had trickled down and made us ign'ant
My favorite cousin said he's returning the favor
And following my auntie with the same behavior

Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
He's more confident to live his plan now (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)
But the family in disbelief this time (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)
Convincing themselves, "He ain't living discreet, he's fine" (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)
They said they never seen it in him, but I seen it (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
The Barbie dolls played off reflection of Venus (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
He built a wall so tall you couldn't climb over
He didn't laugh as hard when the kids start joking (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
"Faggot, faggot, faggot," we ain't know no better
Middle school kids with no filter, however
I had to be very mindful of my good cousin
I knew exactly who he was, but I still loved him
Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
I mean he's really Mary-Ann, even took things further
Changed his gender before Bruce Jenner was certain
Living his truth even if it meant see a surgeon
We didn't talk for a while, he seemed more distant
Wasn't comfortable around me, everything was offensive
But I recall we both had a sick sense of humor
Made raw, but time changes all

Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
Remember church, Easter Sunday?
I sat in the pew, you had stronger faith
More spiritual when these dudes were living life straight
Which I found ironic 'cause the pastor didn't see him the same
He said my cousin was going through some things
He promised the world we living in was an act on abomination
And Demetrius was to blame
I knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacherman
Wondering if God still call you a decent man
Still you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint
Until he singled you out to prove his point, saying
"Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
Church, his auntie is a man now," it hurt
You the most 'cause your belief was close to his words
Forcing me to stand now
I said, "Mr. Preacherman, should we love thy neighbor?
The laws of the land or the heart, what's greater?
I recognize the study she was taught since birth
But that don't justify the feelings that my cousin preserved"
The building was thinking out loud, bad angel
That's when you looked at me and smiled, said, "Thank you"
The day I chose humanity over religion
The family got closer, it was all forgiven
I said them F-bombs, I ain't know any better
Mistakenly, I ain't think that you'd know any different
See, I was taught words was nothing more than a sound
If ever they was pronounced without any intentions
The very second you challenged the shit I was kicking
Reminded me about a show I did out the city
That time I brung a fan on stage to rap
But disapproved the word that she couldn't say with me
You said, "Kendrick, ain't no room for contradiction
To truly understand love, switch position
'Faggot, faggot, faggot,' we can say it together
But only if you let a white girl say 'Nigga'"

// Mr. Morale //

It was one of the worst performances I've seen in my life
I couldn't sleep last night because I felt this shit–
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah
Ooh, ah, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yee

Enoch, your father's just detoxed, my callin' is right on time
Transformation, I must had a thousand lives
And like three thousand wives
You should know that I'm slightly off
Fightin' off demons that been outside
Better known as myself, I'm a demigod
Every thought is creative, sometimes I'm afraid of my open mind

Shit on my mind, and it's heavy
Tell you in pieces 'cause it's way too heavy
My diamonds, the choker is heavy
More life to give on demand, are you ready?
Who keep 'em honest like us?
Who in alignment like us?
Who gotta heal 'em all? Us (Us)
When there's no one to call

Don't need no conversation
If it ain't 'bout the business, shut the door now
Bitch, it's a celebration
And if this shit ain't bussin', what's it for now?

Steppin' out when the weight lifts
Floatin' on 'em (Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin' on 'em (Float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin' on 'em (Float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin' on 'em (Float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Steppin' out when the weight lifts
Floatin' on 'em (Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin' on 'em (Float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin' on 'em (Float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Floatin' on 'em (Float, float, ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)

Uzzi, your father's in deep meditation
My spirit's awakened, my brain is asleep
I got a new temperature
Sharpenin' multiple swords in the faith I believe
I think about Robert Kelly
If he weren't molested, I wonder if life'd fail him
I wonder if Oprah found closure
The way that she postered the hurt that a woman carries
My mother abused young
Like all of the mothers back where we from
SSI bury family members
At the repass, they servin' Popeyes chicken
What you know about Black trauma?
F&Ns, kickin' back is another genre
Tyler Perry, the face of a thousand rappers
Using violence to cover what really happen
I know somebody's listenin'
Past life regressions to know my conditions
It's based off experience
Karma for karma, my habits insensitive
Watchin' my cousin struggle with addiction
Then watchin' her firstborn make a million
And both of them off the grid for forgiveness
I'm sacrificin' myself to start the healin' and...

Shit on my mind and it's heavy
Tell you in pieces 'cause it's way too heavy
My diamonds, the choker is heavy
More life to give on demand, are you ready
Who keep 'em honest like us?
Who in alignment like us?
Who gotta heal 'em all? Us (Us)
When there's no one to call us (Us)

Say, "Hydrate, it's time to heal"
Safe, you're frustrated, I can feel
Huddle up, tie the flag, call the troops, holla back
Huddle up, tie the flag, call the troops, holla back
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
People get taken over by this pain-body (Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
Because this energy field (Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da) that almost has a life of its own (Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da)
It needs to (Ooh-ooh-ooh, da-da), periodically, feed on more unhappiness

// Mother I Sober //

I'm sensitive, I feel everything, I feel everybody
One man standin' on two words, heal everybody
Transformation, then reciprocation, karma must return
Heal myself, secrets that I hide, buried in these words
Death threats, ego must die, but I let it purge
Pacify, broken pieces of me, it was all a blur
Mother cried, put they hands on her, it was family ties
I heard it all, I should've grabbed a gun, but I was only five
I still feel it weighin' on my heart, my first tough decision
In the shadows clingin' to my soul as my only critic
Where's my faith? Told you I was Christian, but just not today
I transformed, prayin' to the trees, God is taking shape
My mother's mother followed me for years in her afterlife
Starin' at me on back of some buses, I wake up at night
Loved her dearly, traded in my tears for a Range Rover
Transformation, you ain't felt grief 'til you felt it sober

I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

I remember lookin' in the mirror knowin' I was gifted
Only child, me for seven years, everything for Christmas
Family ties, they accused my cousin, "Did he touch you, Kendrick?"
Never lied, but no one believed me when I said "He didn't"
Frozen moments, still holdin' on it, hard to trust myself
I started rhymin', copin' mechanisms to lift up myself
Talked to my lawyer, told me not to be so hard on myself
He has an aura, I hope to achieve, if I find some help
Congratulations, made it to be famous, still I feel uneasy
Water watchin', live my life in nature, only thing relieves me
Spirit guide whisper in my ear, tell me that she sees me
"Did he touch you?" I said "No" again, still they didn't believe me
Mother's brother said he got revenge for my mother's face
Black and blue, the image of my queen that I can't erase
'Til this day can't look her in the eyes, pain is takin' over
Blame myself, you never felt guilt 'til you felt it sober

I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

I was never high, I was never drunk, never out my mind
I need control, they handed me some smoke, but still I declined
I did it sober sittin' with myself, I went through all emotions
No dependents, except for one, let me bring you closer
Intoxicated, there's a lustful nature that I failed to mention
Insecurities that I project, sleepin' with other women
Whitney's hurt, the purest soul I know, I found her in the kitchen
Askin' God, "Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?"
Broke me down, she looked me in my eyes, "Is there an addiction?"
I said "No," but this time I lied, I knew that I can't fix it
Pure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me
Gave me a number, said she recommended some therapy
I asked my momma why she didn't believe me when I told her "No"
I never knew she was violated in Chicago, I'm sympathetic
Told me that she feared it happened to me, for my protection
Though it never happened, she wouldn't agree
Now I'm affected, twenty years later trauma has resurfaced
Amplified as I write this song, I shiver 'cause I'm nervous
I was five, questioning myself, 'lone for many years
Nothing's wrong, just results on how them questions made me feel
I made it home, seven years of tour, chasin' manhood
But Whitney's gone, by time you hear this song, she did all she could
All those women gave me superpowers, what I thought I lacked
I pray our children don't inherit me and feelings I attract
A conversation not bein' addressed in Black families
The devastation, hauntin' generations and humanity
They raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters
Then they made us watch, then made us rape each other
Psychotic torture between our lives we ain't recovered
Still livin' as victims in the public eyes who pledge allegiance
Every other brother has been compromised
I know the secrets, every other rapper sexually abused
I see 'em daily buryin' they pain in chains and tattoos
So listen close before you start to pass judgement on how he move
Learn how he cope, whenever his uncle had to walk him from school
His anger grows deep in misogyny
This is post-traumatic Black families and a sodomy, today is still active
So I set free myself from all the guilt that I thought I made
So I set free my mother all the hurt that she titled shame
So I set free my cousin, chaotic for my mother's pain
I hope Hykeem made you proud 'cause you ain't die in vain
So I set free the power of Whitney, may she heal us all
So I set free our children, may good karma keep them with God
So I set free the hearts filled with hatred, keep our bodies sacred
As I set free all you abusers, this is transformation

I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

You did it, I'm proud of you
You broke a generational curse
Say "Thank you, dad"
Thank you, daddy, thank you, mommy, thank you, brother
Mr. Morale

Before I go in fast asleep, love me for me
I bare my soul and now we're free

// Mirror //

I choose me

The pressure's taking over me, it's beginning to loom
Better if I spare your feelings and tell you the truth
Lately, I redirected my point of view
You won't grow waitin' on me
I can't live in the Matrix, huh
Rather fall short of your graces, huh
This time I won't trade places, huh
Not about who's right, who's wrong, huh
Evolve, the only thing known, huh
Ask me when I'm coming home, huh
Blink twice again, I'm gone

I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry

She woke up in the morning for the daily news
I was so low and mourning through the family feuds
Baby, I told you a story and laid down all the rules
Still, you won't grow waiting on me

I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry

'Cause all of it's toxic
Girl, I'm not relevant to givin' on profit
Personal gain off my pain, it's nonsense
Darlin', my demons is off the leash for a moshpit
Baby, I just had a baby, you know she need me
Workin' on myself, the counselin' is not easy
Don't you point a finger, just to point a finger
'Cause critical thinkin' is a deal-breaker
Faith in one man is a ship sinking
Do yourself a favor and get a mirror that mirror grievance
Then point it at me so the reflection can mirror freedom
She told me that she need me the most, I didn't believe her
She even called me names on the post, the world can see it
Jokes and gaslightin'
Mad at me 'cause she didn't get my vote, she say I'm triflin'
Disregardin' the way that I cope with my own vices
Maybe it's time to break it off
Run away from the culture to follow my heart

I realized, true love's not savin' face
But unconditional
When will you let me go?
I trust you'll find independence
If not, then all is forgiven
Sorry I didn't save the world, my friend
I was too busy buildin' mine again

I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
