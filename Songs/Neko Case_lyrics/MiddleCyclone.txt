// This Tornado Loves You //

[Chorus:]
My love I am the speed of sound
I left them motherless, fatherless
Their souls dangling inside-out from thier mouths...
But it's never enough
I want you

I carved your name across three counties
And ground it in with bloody hides
Broken necks will line the ditch
Till you "stop it! stop it! stop this madness! "
I want you

I have waited with a glacier's patience
Smashed every transformer with every trailer
Till nothing was standing
Sixty-five miles wide

But still you are nowhere, still you are nowhere, nowhere in sight
Come out to meet me, run out to meet me
Come into the light

Climb the boxcars to the engine
Through the smoke and to the sky

Your rails could always outrun mine so I
I picked them up and crashed them down
In a moment close to now
Cause I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss
How you'd sigh yourself to sleep
When I'd rake the springtime across your sheets

[Chorus]

My love, I'm an owl on the sill in the evening
But morning finds you
Still warm and breathing
This tornado loves you, what will make you believe me?

// The Next Time You Say Forever //

I hear the tiniest sparks in the tenderest sound. 
Diving music, drowning the sound. 
waltzing with the hairs upon my arms. 
And your fire flood alarm, and you tremble, and you stumble, and you scrape up your palms. 
I can't stay here to hold your hand. 
I've been away for so long. 
I've lost my taste for home, and that's a dirty fallow feeling.
To be the dangling ceiling. 
From the roof came crashing down. 
Peeling in the heat.
Vanish in the rain.
The next time you say forever, I'll punch you in your face. 
Just because you don't believe it, doesn't mean I didn't mean it.
You never know when I'll show you the never.
You never know when I'll show you the never.

// People Got A Lotta Nerve //

So the saying says 
An elephant never forgets 
Standing in the concrete cave 
Swaying side and sing 
They walked over the ocean 
And their dreams they dreamed awake 
Until the lights grew dim 
Until the cop cars came 
Everybody tells me this is crazy, yes I know 

But I'm a man man man man man man man eater 
But still you're surprised prised prised when I eat ya 

You know they call them killer whales 
But you seem suprised 
When it pinned you down to the bottom of the tank 
Where you can't turn around 
It took half your leg and both your lungs 
And I craved I ate hearts of sharks, I know you know it 

I'm a man man man man, man man man eater 
But still you're surprised prised prised when I eat ya [X2]

It will end again in moonlit song 
It will end again in moonlit song

// Polar Nettles //

He takes his dinner in the bath 
Love sickened and infirmed 
The orderly found him there 
Fileted on the marble stairs 
Hat still in hand 
His smoking remains 
Blown out by a kiss from the Sunday scene 
Sunday soon Sunday soon someday soon 

Someday someday someday 

His eyes are closed his mouth has named her rosary her lips and tongue 
She is the centrifuge that throws the spies from the sun 
The cistine chapel dated with the gattling gun 
Someday soon [x4]

Oh the meadows set on him 
Move like starlings of the clearing and tenor of a foggy tongue 
The forcefield round his frosty hips 
Whose shape recalls the wicked spade 
That buried him but on his lips the last rites of man 
Someday soon

// Vengeance Is Sleeping //

I didn't know what a brute I was 
I dipped my cigarette and rode the bus 
Vengeance built me hastily 
And I drag the clanging notion I was nobody, nobody 
Nobody 

All I had was my invention 
And my love it fitted on you 
Oh, look what thoughts can do 
What thoughts can do 
If you're not by now dead and buried 
You're most certifiably married 
Oh, married 

I'm sure you're sleeping sound 
With a mistress of the hours 
The hours that grind your life to dust 

Oh, easy loves 
You keep lap pets 
Denied them you are powerless 
Whatever keeps you sleeping through the night 

I'm not the man you thought I was 
My love has never lived indoors 
I had to drag it home by force 
Hired hounds at both my wrists 
Damp and bruised by stranger's kisses on my lips 
But you're the one that I still miss 
You're the one that I still miss 
And the truth is that it comes as no surprise 

I'm not the man you think I am 
I'm not the man you think I am

// Never Turn Your Back On Mother Earth //

[Originally performed by Sparks]

When she's on her best behavior
Don't be tempted by her favors
Never turn your back on mother earth

Towns are hurled from A to B
By hands that looked so smooth to me
Never turn your back on mother earth

Grasp at straws that don't want grasping
Gaze at clouds that come down crushing
Never turn your back on mother earth

Three days, two nights away from my friends
Amen to anything that brings quick return
To my friends, to my friends

I'll admit I was unfaithful
From now on I'll be more faithful

Never turn your back on mother
(Never turn your back)
Never turn your back on mother
(Never turn your back)
Never turn your back on mother earth
(Never turn your back)

// Middle Cyclone //

Baby, why'm I worried now, 
Did someone make a fool of me 
'fore I could show 'em how it's done? 
Can't give up actin' tough, 
It's all that I'm made of. 
Can't scrape together quite enough 
To ride the bus to the outskirts 
Of the fact that I need love. 

There were times that I tried, 
One for every glass of water 
That I spilled next to the bed, 
Wretching pennies in a boiling well 
In a dream that it once becomes 
A foundry of mute and heavy bells. 
They shake me deaf and dumb 
Say, "Someone made a fool of me 
'fore I could show 'em how it's done." 

It was so clear to me 
That it was almost invisible. 
I lie across the path waiting, 
Just for a chance to be a spiderweb 
Trapped in your lashes. 
For that, I would trade you my empire for ashes. 
But I choke it back, how much I need love...

// Fever //

In an open field at dusk
To footfalls I awoke
Marching ants across my temples, oh
Their feet had no intention
They followed some magnetic drum
Prisoners of their destination

Prom the slats of the factory come
Where once they did make rails
Old death's peculiar songs

He didn't know I was listening
So he crowed out nice and long
To the spiders and the lumber and the dust
Of his conquests and his hunger, his lust
I heard his feet rejoice
I heard him tap his cane
As if he had his own review
On stage at the Athenaeum

I caught his words with my open mouth
I gagged and choked and spit them out
I heard him turn as he did hear
My tiny heartbeat in his ear
I was already running
I heard him coming
Shrapnel spitting from his wheels
His scything arms rake for my heels
I dove and rolled and hid my face
And I said these magic words:

"My dove is home, her breast is warm, my dove is home"

I spoke these magic words and
Fell down, down, the anthill
For days

"My dove is home, her breast is warm, my dove is home"
"My dove is home, her breast is warm, my dove is home"

// I'm An Animal //

You could say it's my instinct
Yes, I still have one
There's no time to second guess it
Yes, there are things that I'm still so afraid of
But my courage is roaring like the sound of the sun
Cause it's vain about its mane
And will reveal them to no one

Now I'm an animal
You're an animal, too

Pick up that rock (drink from that lake)
I do my best but I'm made of mistakes
Yes, there are things I'm still quite sure of
I love you this hour
This hour today
And heaven will smell like the airport (airport)
But I may never get there to prove it
So let's not waste our time thinking how that ain't fair

I'm an animal
You're an animal, too

You're an animal, too

// Prison Girls //

Where am I tonight? La, da, da 
My hotel room won't remember me 
And this dream will die, die by morning 
And this dream won't remember me 

Awakened by a droning voice 
I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 
Is it a lady or is it a man 
Humming helicopters through the blades of a fan 

I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 
I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 

On my feet to chase it down 
The lights were spokes and rungs away 
I stumbled back and hit the floor 
Long shadows crawl beneath the door 
To a passage so poorly lit 
There's moths flying away from it 

Who am I tonight? La, da, da 
My hotel room won't remember me 
Darkness enter prison girls 
Pushing mops and kicking pails 
Now's my chance 
I clasp my chest 
And declare unto my audience 
I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 
I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes 

Prison girls are not impressed 
They're the ones that have to clean this mess 
They've traded more for cigarettes 
Than I've managed to express 

Filing past miles long 
The cheek is frozen to the floor 
The prison girls have filled their beds 
Their thoughts too dry above their heads 

I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes

// Don't Forget Me //

In the wintertime keep your feet warm
But keep your clothes on and don't forget me
Keep your memories
But keep your powder dry too

In the summer by the poolside
While the fireflies are all around you
I'll miss you when I'm lonely
I'll miss the alimony too

Don't forget me, don't forget me
Make it easy, only just for a little while
You know I think about you
Let me know you think about me too

And when we're older and full of cancer
It doesn't matter now, come on get happy
'Cause nothing lasts forever
But I will always love you

Don't forget me, please don't forget me
Make it easy, only just for a little while
You know I think about you
Let me know you think about me too

// The Pharaohs //

You were married in the mirrored hall when I was 16 
You spoke the words, "I love girls in white leather jackets" 
That was good enough for love, it was good enough for me 

I listened in when you thought you were lost 
Caught in those fangs on a tornado sprawl 

Who knows what you know 
I only heard what I wanted 
You said I was your blue, blue baby 
And you were right 
You said I was your blue, blue baby 
And you were right 

Wondered the halls of the nighttime 
My body burned, my legs ached 
But you never came to bed 
You just left me there awake 

You kept me wanting wanting wanting 
Like the wanting in the movies and the hymns 
I want the pharaohs, but there's only men 
I want the pharaohs, but there's only men 

You said I was your new blue baby 
And you were right 
You said I was your new blue baby 
And you were right

// Red Tide //

There's a smell here that stands my hairs on end 
Dog hair in the heater, gas pumps and cedar 
And jackknifes on the nine 
And seabirds choked on fishing line 

Clouds are a hush but the chainsaws mush on to Custer and Columbia 
Salty tentacles drink in the sun but the red tide is over 
The mollusks they have won 

There's a smell here of gravel and cigarettes lit 
When the match made them sweet 
When the engine turned over and beat up our street 
Oh, that was the day 
To remember 

I remember because of the fires that leapt 
From the caves of the things that have not happened yet 
When I think of it now they smell to me quite sinister 

I want to go back and die at the drive in 
Die before strangers can say 
I hate the rain 
I hate the rain
