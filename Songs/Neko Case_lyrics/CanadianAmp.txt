// Andy //

One, two, three, four

Andy
The summer's over
I never noticed
Did you really think you'd leave so fast

This morning
Was feeling colder
One year older
Did you really think we'd feel so bad

Andy
It scares me sober
Think it's over
Did you really think we'd feel so bad
Did you really think we'd feel so bad

It helped me through the spring
Just to dream of what it might become
Woke up to find it'd been here and gone

Andy
Summer's over
I never noticed
Did you really think you'd leave so fast
Did you really think you'd leave so fast
Did you really think you'd leave so fast

// Dreaming Man //

I'm a dreaming man
Yes that's my problem
(Dreaming man)
I can't tell when I'm
Not being real
In the meadow dusk
I park my Aerostar
(Dreaming man)
With a loaded gun
And sweet dreams of you

I'll always be a dreaming man
I don't have to understand
I know it's all right

See your curves and I
Feel your vibrations
(Dreaming man)
You're dressed in black and white
You're lost in the mall
I watch you disappear
Past Club Med vacations
(Dreaming man)
Another sleepless night
A sun that won't fall

I'll always be a dreaming man
I don't have to understand
I know it's all right

Now the night is gone
A new day is dawning
(Dreaming man)
And our homeless dreams
Go back to the street
Another time or place
Another civilization
(Dreaming man)
That really make this life
Feel so complete

I'll always be a dreaming man
I don't have to understand
I know it's all right

Dreaming man
He's got a plan
(Dreaming man)
Dreaming man
He's got a plan
(Dreaming man)
Dreaming man
He's got a plan
Dreaming man

// Knock Loud //

Knock loud, I'm home
Just sleeping to pass the time
Wondering if you'll come by to visit me

Ten years have passed
Since you walked out of my life
But late last night in the pharmacy
You were in the line in front of me
So I ran away to hide

Knock loud I'm home
I wrote in black felt pen
Took that sign and taped it to the door

If you come in
To see how I have been
Make sure the door is closed behind you

Stand above me
While I poised do plunge
Through my heart attack
Kills the worst of me
Said I was sorry
Drink to forgive
I wake up alone
Knock loud I'm home

// Make Your Bed //

Make your bed the river young girl
Make your bed the river young girl
La la la la la la:
Make your bed the river young girl

Did you come here to meet him my dear
You're surprised to find only me
Well I put him to rest at the bend in the river
And the same I require of you

I'm thick with disease in my madness
Only one thought pacifies me
That the murky black water grounds your bones to sand
When the catfish have stripped off your hide

Make your bed the river young girl
Make your bed the river young girl
I know you can't swim but I'll tuck you in
Make your bed the river young girl

So go down as his trembling bride
For too frail are fury inside
And if there's a chance the Lord recognizes you
Pray he has more mercy than I

Make your bed the river young girl
Make your bed the river young girl
I know you can't swim but I'll tuck you in
Make your bed the river young girl

Make your bed the river young girl

// Poor Ellen Smith //

Poor Ellen Smith, how was she found
Shot through the heart lying cold on the ground
Her body was mangled, and all cast around
A blood marks the spot where poor Ellen was found

They picked up her body, and carried it away
Now she's a-sleepin' in some lonesome grave
Who had the heart, and who had the brain
To shoot my little darling on that cold lonesome plain

They picked up their rifles, and hunted us down
They found us a loafin' all around town
The judge my convict me, and God knows he can
But I know I died as an innocent man

I've been in this prison for seven long years
Each night I see Ellen through my bitter tears
I got a letter yesterday I read it today
The flowers on her grave have all faded away

The warden just told me that soon I'll be free
To go to her grave 'neath that old willow tree
I'm free from the walls of that prison, at last
But I'll never be free from my sins of the past

Poor Ellen Smith, how was she found
Shot through the heart lying cold on the ground

// In California //

In California I dream of snow
And all the places we used to go
With the night falling down
With the night falling down
Now I'm living in Korea Town
Waking to the sound of car alarms

I remember your face when I showed you the ticket
Said you were happy for me, your heart wasn't in it
Just a phone call away
Now there's nothing to say
As the days roll by, disconnected

In the land where the sun is always shining on
Crying alone, palm tress are laughing at me
Another fool playing songs that don't matter
For people who chatter endlessly

Another suicide on the 405
The Black Dahlia she's smiles and smiles
It's the same old town that bled her dry
One more starlet one more time
Bound to make it do or die
Talk a walk to Bonnie Brae
Try to wash these dreams away
They try to tell me L.A is beautiful when it rains

// Alone And Forsaken //

We met in the springtime
When blossoms unfold
The pastures were green and
Meadows were gold

Our love was in flower as summer grew on
A love like the leaves has withered and gone
The roses have faded
There's frost at my door
The birds in the morning don't sing anymore

The grass in the valley has started to die
Out in the darkness the whippets will cry

Alone and forsaken
Oh lord if you hear me then hold to my hand
Oh please understand

Where has she gone to, oh where can she be
She may have forsaken some other like me
She promised to honor, to love and obey
Each vow was a plaything that she threw away

The darkness is falling
The sky has turned gray
A hound in the distance is starting to bay

I wonder, I wonder what she's thinking of
Forsaken, forgotten without any love

Alone and forsaken
By Fate and by man
Oh lord if you hear me then hold to my hand
Oh please understand
Oh please understand
