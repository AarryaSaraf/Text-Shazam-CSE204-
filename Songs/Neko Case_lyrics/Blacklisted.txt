Album: Blacklisted

// Things That Scare Me //

Fluorescent lights engage
Blackbirds frying on a wire
Same birds that followed me to school when I was young
Were they trying to tell me something?
Were they telling me to run?

The hammer clicks in place
The world's gonna pay
Right down in the face of God and his saints
Claim your soul's not for sale
I'm a dying breed who still believes
Haunted by American dreams
Haunted by American dreams

// Deep Red Bells //

He led you to this hiding place
His lightening threats spun silver tongues
The red bells beckon you to ride
A handprint on the driver's side
It looks a lot like engine oil and tastes like being poor and small
And Popsicles in the summer

Deep red bells, deep as I've been done
Deep red bells, deep as I've been done

It always has to come this
Red bells ring this tragic gun
Lost sight of the overpass
The daylight won't remember her
When speckled fronds raise round your bones
Who took the time to fold your clothes
Who shook the Valley of the Shadow

Deep red bells, deep as I've been done
Deep red bells, deep as I've been done

Where does this mean world cast its cold eye
Who's left to suffer long about you
Does your soul cast about like an old paper bag
Past empty lots and early graves
Those like you who lost their way
Murdered on the interstate
While the red bells rang like thunder

Deep red bells, deep as I've been done
Deep red bells, deep as I've been done
Deep red bells, deep as I've been done

// Outro With Bees //

How's hope feeling today
Tired and sick of this place
Red wine is fast
At the lip of your glass
Saying I'm going to ruin
Everything
Everything
So its better my sweet
That we hover like bees
'Cause there's no sure footing
No love, I believe

// Lady Pilot //

What?

Stars can't fight city lights
They've turned their backs on us
It's true today, I saw it from the plane
Aeroplanes were never built to fly

Down down down down...
Don't look down
Don't look now

Crosshairs of our shadow trace the dam
Told that there were people trapped alive
Boulder City looks like coals in the fire

Cabin's perched by satellites
And now it's flying down
We've got a lady pilot
She's not afraid to die

It's true today, I saw it from the plane
We've almost finished reeling in the sky
Power lines once laced the heavens
Pima County looks like coals in the fire...

// Tightly //

When I'm walkin' under stars
I covet all the waning hours
All the lonely houses stand like monuments
To thieves

When I'm walkin' in the dark
I'm free to covet all I want
You've made it all so very dangerous
I can't stay away

When I'm walkin' under trees
I'm free to covet all I please
New moons in the alley
And it's madness calls to me

Tonight, tonight, tonight...

If I meet you in the night
You're free to covet all you like
Don't you try and stop me
I cling tightly...to this life

// Look For Me (I'll Be Around) //

When you tire of all the bright lights
Haste that's killing and you're willing to stay home nights
When your feet are back on the solid ground
Look for me, I'll be around

When the new crowd starts to bore you
Just remember there is someone to adore you
When you're weary of nights out on the town
Look for me, I'll be around

May not seem exciting the way those others do
I'm emotion, my devotion
You will need some day as I need you

When the kicks go that it brings you
You will hanker for an anchor just to cling to
When you've lived it up till it's got you down
Look for me, look for me
Look for me, I'll be around

// Stinging Velvet //

Rain falls, I fix my eyes
Let go of the focus and I blur out all the lines
Just to remember, remember

Crying 'cause it's not my fault
Water through my lashes look just like Christmas lights
And I still remember, remember

Cold and shivering
Cold and shivering
Cold and shivering warm

Sing please, rock me to sleep
Quiet as a canyon up under heaven's eaves
I surrender, surrender

Downstairs the furnace swells
Safe from all the horrors in your stinging velvet arms
And I surrender, surrender

Cold and shivering
Cold and shivering
Cold and shivering warm

// Pretty Girls //

Oh pretty girls, you're too good for this
How you break my heart in this cold waiting room
Oh pretty girls, you're too good for this
Don't let them tell you you're nothing
Don't let them break your hearts too

The TV is blaring and angry
As if you don't know why you're here
Those who walk without sin are so hungry
Don't let the wolves in, pretty girls

Your hearts are so tried and so innocent
Wind your flimsy blue gowns tight around you
Around curves so comely and sinister
They blame it on you pretty girls

Oh pretty girls, you're too good for this
How you break my heart in this cold waiting room
Oh pretty girls, you're too good for this
Don't let them tell you you're nothing
Don't let them break your hearts too

My girls, you're just like the heavens
Not a soul to take your hand in theirs
Your tears and wild constellations
Broad limbs and hard folding chairs

But there's millions to count you and keep you
And lovers that don't understand
Don't let them tell you you're nothing
'Cause you'll change the world pretty girls

Come chain yourself from my ankles
You'll see the world like a bird
Diving down low, flying up high
Thru all of these saccharine gutters we'll ride and I

Won't say that I told you so

// I Missed The Point //

I have lightning
If the stars dry out to guide me
I have soft clay
To knit my bones astride
What a miracle they say
Dark clouds gather
Velvet holes
Gaping wide oh
And they pour it down
And they sing to me
Of wonders
Unseen
Like clouds that rise
From the sea, oh
And I'm sorry
I'm so sorry
That I missed the point
Of this pageantry
But I'm grateful
That you love me

// I Wish I Was The Moon //

Chimney falls and lovers blaze
Thought that I was young
Now I've freezing hands and bloodless veins
As numb as I've become

I'm so tired
I wish I was the moon tonight

Last night I dreamt I had forgotten my name
'Cause I had sold my soul but awoke just the same
I'm so lonely
I wish I was the moon tonight

God blessed me, I'm a free man
With no place free to go
I'm paralyzed and collared-tight
No pills for what I fear

This is crazy
I wish I was the moon tonight

Chimney falls and lovers blaze
Thought that I was young
Now I've freezing hands & bloodless veins
As numb as I've become

I'm so tired,
I wish I was the moon tonight

How will you know if you found me at last
'Cause I'll be the one, be the one, be the one
With my heart in my lap
I'm so tired, I'm so tired
And I wish I was the moon tonight

I'm so tired, I'm so tired,
And I wish I was the moon
I'm so tired, I'm so tired,
And I wish I was the moon tonight

// Runnin' Out Of Fools //

Are you sure you got the right number
Is it me you wanna talk to tonight
Everyone in town's got your number
Everybody's got you pegged right

Is that why you got in touch with me
Ohhh, guess you must be runnin' out of fools

You left me all alone right here
Your goodbye was even colder than last
Didn't bother you I was cryin'
Now you wanna break my heart twice

Is that why you got in touch with me
Ohhh, guess you must be runnin' out of fools

You got back to my name in your little black book
Tell you what I guess you forgot how I even look
Yes you did

So go ahead with all your sweet talkin'
Go ahead for all the good it can do
Have yourself a dime's worth of talkin'
Then I'm gonna hang right up on you

'Cause this time you're not getting through to me
Ohhh, gues you must be runnin' out of fools

Even fools like me (fools like me)
Even fools like me

Runnin' out of fools (fools like me)
Even fools like me (fools like me)

// Ghost Wiring //

What happens at home since I've gone away
Needles drop soft and sharp
And the leaves gently sway
Low ceiling moves in and circles the bay
Rain rakes the trees
The Sound that's counted so many days
So many days

Wet shoes drag you off to school
Shoes that never dry
Crows curse and beat their wings
Why can't you be smarter girl?
Lift up your face

Don't feel sorry for yourself
I'll always wait for you
Your ghost is a lightshow at night
On the Grand Coulee Dam
The river is watching you
At the drive-in tonight
Who do they comfort now
Since I've gone away

// Outro With Bees (Reprise) //

How's hope feeling today
Tired and sick of this place
Red wine is fast at the lip of your glass
Sayin' I'm gonna ruin everything...everything

So it's better my sweet
That we hover like bees
'Cause there's no sure footing
No love I believe
