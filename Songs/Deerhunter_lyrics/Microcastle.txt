// Agoraphobia //

Cover me, cover me
Come for me, come for me
Cover me, cover me
Comfort me, comfort me

I had a dream
No longer to be free
I want only to see
Four walls made of concrete

6 by 6 enclosed
Soon we're on video, oh, oh, oh
Feed me twice a day
I want to fade away, away

Cover me, cover me
Come for me, come for me
Cover me, cover me
Comfort me, comfort me

And after some time
I know I would go blind
But seeing only binds
The vision to the eye

I'd lose my voice, I know
But I've nothing left to say
It is nothing left to pray
No echo in this place

// Never Stops //

I had dreams
That frightened me awake
I happened to escape
But my escape

Would never come
Would never come
Would never come
Would never come

I had plans
To go away for days
To try and risk a pace
That haunts my days

That haunts my days
Haunts my days
Haunts my days
Haunts my days

I love
I love
I love

Winter
In my heart
It never stops
It never stops

Oh, winter
Oh, winter
Oh, winter
Oh, winter

It never stops
It never stops
It never stops
It never stops
It never

I love
I love
I love

// Little Kids //

Kids drinking gin on the
The front lawn
The kids see that man walking down
The dirt road

These kids see the sky and they think of him
Dressed in flames
Kids walk behind, slowly stalk
That old man

To get older still
To get older still
To get older still
To get older still

These kids followed him in
Into his shed
Where he turns on the radio
And smokes a cig
These kids come with gasoline
And they strike a match

To get older still
To get older still
To get older still
To get older

To get older still
To get older still
To get older still
To get older still

// Microcastle //

All I've seen
All I've seen

Try to
Describe it
In the time
Of all of it

Try not to
Come to bed
Warm me and
I might slip
I might do
I might

Try to
Describe it all
In your time
End it all

All I do
It may be not it
On and on, it could
Be my beginning

All through time
All through time

// Calvary Scars //

Crucified on a cross
In front of all my closest friends

// Green Jacket //

I take
What I can
I give
What I have left

I take
By the hand
What I need
What I see

Skulls pressed
Flesh on flesh
Skulls pressed
Flesh on flesh

// Activa //

Wasted our lives
We wasted our time
I trickled out
Creek would run dry

Steam would rise
I tried
I tried
I tried
I tried

// Nothing Ever Happened //

Only when I dream but there's no way out
You learn to talk, you learn to shout
Focus on the depth that was never there
Eliminate what you can't repair

Nothing ever happened to me
Nothing ever happened to me
Nothing ever happened to me
Life just passed and flashed right through me

Sleep through the winter, awake in spring
Adjust your eyes to the state of things
Focus on the depth that was never there
Nothing's easy, nothing's fair

Nothing ever happened to me
Nothing ever happened to me
Nothing ever happened to me
Life just passed and flashed right through me

I never saw it coming
Waiting for something, for nothing
I never saw it coming
Waiting for something, for nothing

// Saved By Old Times //

Mrs. Hemmings was OAO
Pretty soon we were all OAO
We were captured by Victorian vampires
With elaborate designs, with elaborate designs

This is the land of OAO
This is the land of OAO
This is the land of OAO
This is the land of OAO

We are a Romanian sound collage (old black bandit)
Searching for the ghost of past [?] (I can't stand it)
But this futile coffin will not let us gain entry (I'm your planet, old black bandit)
Into the immortal soul of the redneck (I can't stand it)
You are trapped in your basement for a war of 16 years (I'm your planet, old black bandit)
To combat prevention and in combat with yourself
We are in combat with these cultural vampires
We were trapped in the basement
We were trapped in the basement of the fucking teenage halfway hell

I was saved by old times
I was saved by old times
I was saved by old times
I was saved by old times

I was saved by old times
I was saved by old times
I was saved by old times
I was saved by old times

// Neither Of Us, Uncertainly //

So long to the
The days you grow sad of
And you try to find
Not much for you to hold
The more that you hold the
The more you feel alone

And wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
No more

So long to the
The days you come to know
So you had to
To get there on your own

To wait
To grow old
You're waiting
To grow old

Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
No more

Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait

Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
Until you can wait
No more

// Twilight At Carbon Lake //

Go to the shore and
Pray for the sea
Go towards the mirror and
Pray that you'll see
Someone else
Downtown
Go downtown

Go to the waves of grain
In the center of the state
Go away
Go to a parking lot
Sit on the ground and cry
You'll never know why

Start over

Go to the ocean
On a ship
Wave goodbye to the waves
And the
Frozen shit
That was in your heart

So long
Time slows when it goes away
Go away
Time Slows
So long
