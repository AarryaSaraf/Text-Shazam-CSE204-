Album: WhyHasntEverythingAlreadyDisappeared

// Death In Midsummer //

Come on down from that cloud
And cast your fears aside

You're all here and there
And there's nothing inside

May God's will be done
In these poisoned hills

And let the devil be cast out on his tail
Hey!

There was a voice that called me
There was a light that burned me

Come on and let's be sure
Let's not pave the way

Your friends have died
And their lives, they just fade away

Some worked the hills
Some worked in factories
Worked their lives away

And in time, you will see your own life fade away

There was no time to go back
There was no time to go back
Come on!

They were in hills
They were in factories
They are in graves now

They were in debt to themselves
And what is it made of now?

I go around and feel how it fades
I walk around and I see what's fading
Walk around and you'll see how it fades
Walk around and you'll see what's faded

// No One's Sleeping //

No one's sleeping
Great unrest
In the country
There's much duress
Violence has taken hold
Follow me
The golden void

No one's sleeping
The village green
Is nocturnal
Finally
Follow me
To golden pond
There is peace
The great beyond

// Element //

The wind was stained
Orange clouds laid out for a toxic view
Of endless time, endless time
Let it wash over your body

The wind was stained
Orange clouds laid out for the last time
There would come a time, radar flashed
Indoors we go

And it said
"Do you go?"
(Elemental, elemental)
Completely gone
(Elemental, elemental)
Element (Elemental)
Element (Elemental)
Elemental (Elemental)
Elemental (Elemental)
Elemental (Elemental)
Elemental (Elemental)

Comes a time
Reborn until you die
Lay these plans out on the paper
They said he was gone
Never coming home
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

Cancer words
Laid out in lines
The road was wide
The road was silent
Curtain call for all those lives
Expensive lighting for that final day

Come on down
(Elemental, elemental)
Fire, wind, water
(Elemental, elemental)
There will be time to see
(Elemental, elemental)
Just watch me shocked

It's elemental how I move
It's elemental how I move
It's elemental how I move
It's elemental how I move

// What Happens To People? //

What happens to people?
Their lives up in arms
What happens to people?
They quit holding on
What happens to people
And what can they do?
They're only returning
The powers of youth
What happens to people?
What happened to you?
What happens to people?
They fade out of view

I can't remember
Your face
It's lost to me
It's lost to me
Now it's ending
The wounds remain
On the page
On the page

What happens to people?
They quit holding on
What happens to people?
Their dreams turn to dark
The rust in your castle
You're trying to fill

Old lady
Let me into your rotting house
Your rotting house
Old man
Take a step back
And figure it out, out
Figure it out

Old lady
Cover your branches
Winter is coming
Beware
Old man
Oil your engine
You're rusting out
You're rusting out

What happens to people?
They quit holding on
And they're locked out
They get locked out
Locked out
They get locked out
Locked out
They get locked out

// Détournement //

Good morning to Japan
And the eastern sunrise
Over these majestic cliffs
And the vultures circling
Hello to salt water and good times
And there is not much left to go
Your struggles won't be long
And there will be no sorrow on the other side
Only three freedoms and range of texts
[?], old times coming back
Hello to Europe and your gardens wet with rain
Hello to Spain
There is some form of art left
That we can imagine a world drawn piece for piece
And we can contact the higher spirits from our electronic brains
Hello to America and many lines drawn across America
Hello to California, with your mists of driftwood and rock
And giant redwoods casting shadows on the past

(Hello)

Hello Russia
Hello Australia
Eternal jet lag
And time starts to run backwards
Hello eternal return
Eternal détournement

// Futurism //

Your cage is what you make it
If you decorate it
It goes back faster
Goes quick, laughter
Permeates the carnage
Laying out in sunlight
At daybreak, oh
Daybreak, oh
Oh

You look cute in plastic
My existence drastic
And lake of flowers
Burning flowers
Try to make it faster
Crayons in the laughter
A screen of gel
Patient hell

Call it what you want, dear
I call it fear
And I am an expert
Laying out brick by brick
Call it what you need to
I left behind reason
Faith I take, I, faith I take, I

// Tarnung //

When the day goes by
Objects of the mind
Rivers open wide
Call for me to come outside
Avenues with rain
A place to fade away
Face into gold light
I fade black and white

// Plains //

I was listening to the trains
I was up all night
And something glistened in the strange
Blood diffuse light
My friend was missing
And I was ghost
I was flame, I was bright
I was listening to the trains
I was up all night

Oh, James
You've got no reason to stay
In these plains

I was racing against time
With this friend of mine
Collapsing just before
We reached the end of the line
He was lifting diamonds straight
Straight was cold, cold was black
And black was glistening
All the night the sound remained

Oh, James
You've got no reason to stay
In these plains
These plains
Are barren and hateful to rain
And what remains
Is the sound of trains

// Nocturne //

I was in the pi- scented -otograph
Laying on the cold -d
And the boundary was spreading like disea-se
Like disea-e
And there were no boundaries left to cross
Only the space imagined from due discou-rse
I was in the boundary
Abducted by border guards in the
Back country road
Back country road

Ba-need
Oh, oh, there were no, no atmospheric devices
There were no -d out and the basement was so moldy and wet
Mildew spread like spider webs on these
Back, back, ba-
-ountry road
