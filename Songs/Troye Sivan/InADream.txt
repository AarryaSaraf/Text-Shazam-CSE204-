// Take Yourself Home //

I'm tired of the city
Scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die
Let's die somewhere pretty (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Sad in the summer
City needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time
Then it's time to go
Take yourself home

Talk to me
There's nothing that can't be fixed with some honesty
And how it got this dark is just beyond to me
If anyone can hear me switch the lights (Lights, lights, lights)
Oh-oh-oh-oh

And happiness
Is right there where you lost it
When you took the bet
Counting all the losses that you can't collect
Got everything and nothing in my life

I'm tired of the city
Scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die
Let's die somewhere pretty (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Sad in the summer
City needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time then it's time to go
Take yourself home
Take yourself home

Who you really tryna be when they see your face?
Is it worth it trying to win in a losing game?
Well it's all waiting for you
And, boy, I know you're eager
But it just might destroy you
Destroy you, yeah

I'm tired of the city
Scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die
Let's die somewhere pretty (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Sad in the summer
City needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time then it's time to go
Take yourself home
Take yourself home
Take yourself home

// Easy //

You ran away to find something to say
I went astray to make it okay, and he made it easy, darlin'
I'm still in love and I say that because
I know how it seems between you and me, it hasn't been easy, darlin'

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo!
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy
Easy
Please don't leave me
Leave me

What's left of the dance? That's all on my hands
The rock in my throat, a hair on my coat
The stranger at home, my darlin'
(Like some kind of freak, my darlin')
Now I'm vulnerable, so sad and alone
But don't cry for me, 'cause everyone knows
You reap what you sow, my darlin'
Uh-yeah, yeah, yeah

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo!
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy
Easy
Please don't leave me
Don't leave me

(He made it easy)
(Please don't leave me)
(He made it easy)
(Please don't leave me)

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo!
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy
Easy
Please don't leave me, no
Don't leave me

(He made it easy)
(Please don't leave me)
(He made it easy)
(Please don't leave me)

// could cry just thinkin about you //

Now I'm knee-deep in this mess
I could cry just thinking about you
Every line I write is something about you
Every guy I want looks something just like you
Every book I read I only read for you
Every art piece is just to remind you
I don't know who I am with, or without you
But I guess I'm bout to find out
I, I, I

// STUD //

Hey, stud, you can come
And you can come and meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love

Hey, tough, what's it like to be so big and strong and so buff?
Everything I'm not, but could I still be a hunk to you?
Enough for you
A stud to you

Takin' the fun out of fucks
Searchin' for something I'm not
Knowin' that you're not the one
(But you're the one for right now, yeah)

How much of me would you take?
And how much of me would you change?
On second thought, don't say a thing
('Cause you're the one for right now)

Just let me believe that you like what you seein'
When you're lookin' at me and your heartbeat is speedin'
At seven hundred miles down highways to Eden
Like my body's the apple you're eatin'

Hey, stud, you can come
And you can come and meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love

Hey, stud, you can come
And you can come and meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love

We're into this (Right?)
We should do this (Right?)
You could make my (Night)
We should do this (Right?)
We're into this (Right?)
We should do this (Right?)
You could make my (Night)
We should do this (Right?)
(Right?)

Just let me believe that you like what you seein'
When you're lookin' at me and your heartbeat is speedin'
At seven hundred miles down highways to Eden
Like my body's the apple you're eatin', yeah

You're into this
We should do this

You're into this (Right?)
(You could make my night)
(You're into this, right?)
(You could make my night)
You're into this
(My night)

// 10/10 //

Now we're adversaries in a pretty house, yeah
Couldn't tell you what we're even fight 'bout, yeah
That's probably something we should figure out, yeah
Ooh

'Cause I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
But let's be what we are (Let's be what we are)

Infatuation fading in and out, yeah
Gotta find a piece that keeps us sticking 'round, yeah
I should say I don't have a shred of doubt, yeah
We're alright, 'cause

I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
But let's be what we are (Let's be what we are)

There will be dark days, ooh
Swear that they'll be short
There will be good days, ooh
There'll be so many more
You can always be sure that

I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
But let's be what we are (Let's be what we are)

// Rager teenager! //

Hey you
Where you been hanging out lately?
(You)
Sleeping and spending nights, wasting time
Never thought I'd see you again in my life
Why you been acting like a stranger?
Feeling the love, a teenager, ooh
Feels kinda cool in the rager and I
Never thought I'd see the day in my life
Yet here you are

I just want to go wild
I just wanna fuck shit up and just ride
In your car tonight
In your bed tonight
I just want to sing loud
I just want to lose myself in a crowd
In your arms tonight
Burn in his arms tonight

Hey, my lil rager teenager
Trying to figure it out
Living a season of screaming
And turning it out
Hey, my lil rager teenager
I've missed you around, yeah
Missed you around

Hey you
Where you been hanging out lately?
(You)
Sleeping and spending nights, wasting time
Never thought I'd see you again in my life
Why you been acting like a stranger
Feeling the love, a teenager
Feels kinda cool in the rager and I
Never thought I'd see the day in my life
Yet here we are, yeah
Never thought I'd see the day in my life
Yet here we are

I just want to go wild
I just wanna do some shit just to try
In your car tonight
In your bed tonight
I just want to sing loud
I just want to lose myself in a crowd
In your arms tonight
Or in his arms tonight

Hey, my lil rager teenager
Trying to figure it out
Live in a season of screaming
And turning it out
Hey, my lil rager teenager
Trying to figure it out
Hey, my lil rager teenager
I've missed you around
Missed you around

// IN A DREAM //

I think about it
Can't think about it
Took a flight all the way home, yeah, ooh
No way around it
I still see you way up here, yeah

I'm stressed about it
Went West about it
Took a hammer to my phone, yeah, ooh
The way you run it
I still hear you crystal clear

But I won't let you in again
I'm gonna lock the doors and hide my shit
'Cause my spirit's wearing thin
And there's only so much I can give
I won't let you in again
That's the hardest thing I've ever said
You know, that's the hardest thing I've said

Guess I might understand it
If you don't listen to me
But I thought it was obvious
That you don't show up in a dream
Guess I even forgive you
For you not wanting to leave, no, no, no
Put my shoes on and run away
You still show up in a dream
Only making this harder
'Cause I still have to see your, see your face, yeah

Can you come back?
Wait, I don't mean that, no
It's all just feeling real now, ooh
So far away, but I still feel you everywhere

But I can't let you in again
I'm gonna lock the doors and hide my shit (Hide my shit)
'Cause my spirit's wearing thin
And there's only so much I can give (I can give)
I don't wanna let you in again
That's the hardest thing I've ever said
You know, that's the hardest thing I've said

Guess I might understand it
If you don't listen to me
But I thought it was obvious
That you don't show up in a dream
Guess I even forgive you
For you not wanting to leave, no, no, no
Put my shoes on and run away
You still show up in a dream
Only making this harder
'Cause I still have to see your, see your face, yeah

But I can't let you in again
I'm gonna lock the doors and hide my shit
'Cause my spirit's wearing thin
And there's only so much I can give
I won't let you in again
That's the hardest thing I've ever said
You know, that's the hardest thing I've said

Guess I might understand it
If you don't listen to me
But I thought it was obvious
That you don't show up in a dream
Guess I even forgive you
For you not wanting to leave, no, no, no
Put my shoes on and run away
You still show up in a dream
Only making this harder
'Cause I still have to see your, see your face, yeah
