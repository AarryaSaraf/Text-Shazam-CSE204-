This song is not for the living
This song is for the dead

With my face
Against the floor
I can't see who knocked me out of the way
I don't want
To get back up
But I have to, so it might as well be today

Nothing appeals to me
No one feels like me
I'm too busy being calm to disappear
I'm in no shape
To be alone
Contrary to the shit that you might hear

So walk with me
Walk with me
Don't let this symbolism kill your heart
Walk with me
Walk with me
Just like we should've done right from the start

Walk with me
Walk with me
Don't let this fucking world tear you apart

// Sarcastrophe //

Wallow in the winter of it
Discover what you truly covet
Underneath and far above it
You slither in all kinds of shit

How could you forget about it?
Did you think you could minimize?
This is the age of consent
You'll get a day in the sun
Before I kill your fucking lights

Burn up in your atmosphere
Burn up in your utmost fear

Desecrate your temples
Only hell and hate remain
Don't look for crows to scatter
Prepare for judgment day

We are kill gods

The kings are falling down
Can I find a way to get there?
Bury your head in the ground
Will you falsify for your fair share?

When it's done, it's done plus negative one?
It's everybody's guess but the apathy won
Will you come testify in the court of myopic opinion?
Or will you settle for oblivion?

We are kill gods

(We) We make this world worth saving
(Are) Are you prepared to believe?
(Kill) Kill everything that kills you
(Gods) Live long and die for me

You rape crutch and sick in the middle of an evidence bag that'll never obey
All these years spent hiding all the bodies
I can never be sure but I remember the graves

We are kill gods

(We) We make this world worth saving
(Are) Are you prepared to believe?
(Kill) Kill everything that kills you
(Gods) Live long and die for me

Live long and die for me
Live long and die for me

// AOV //

Black dirty teeth in the crease
Was the proof too good to be believed?
It's the cunt with the tongue.
Who belongs on broken knees

So far it occurs to me
That everybody in the world is afraid of me
Just one more sin and down we go
But the news is out
And I think I'm going to kill myself
Or fuck myself, or tell myself
About the only thing that matters now

We bury what we fear the most
Approaching original violence
Is the silence where you hide it?
'Cause I don't recognize you anymore

To each his own
Life can do with one less watered-down excuse
If this is over you can tell me it's no use

Use, just tell me it's over

Today we will deceive our better selves
Into assimilating pain from something else
Put on your face and show me why
Behind the scenes we had to simply comply

Now the community doesn't feel any better than it used to be
I want to be a judge in a criminal case
You covered up, did you cultivate?
Be yourself, not yourself, know yourself
'Cause no one seems to know you now

We carry what we can't control
Approaching original violence
In the silence there's a nihilist
Who doesn't care and never did

To each his own
Life can do with one less watered-down excuse
There comes a time when we can't take the same abuse
If this is over you can tell me it's no use

Use

Drug out, pissed on, everything's the same
Bitch and moan, it doesn't matter, nothing's going to change
I don't want to watch another brother fucking die
So discarded, fallen by the side
Don't tell me it's the only way
Just another reason why you never take the bait
The trials, the scheming, the burden of the beast
Both your faces turn your back on everything you fought to save a dream

Now that it's overâ¦ when this is overâ¦

We are the angels, fear to tread
Approaching original violence
We're the silence, we'll deny it
We can't continue on like this

To each his own
Life can do with one less watered-down excuse
There comes a time when we can't take the same abuse
My god, it would've taken just one word to stay from you
Now that this is over you can tell me it's no use
Now that this is over you can tell me it's no use

Use, just tell me it's over

It doesn't matter what you say
It doesn't matter what you do
We can't continue on like this

// The Devil In I //

Undo these chains, my friend
I'll show you the rage I've hidden
Perish the Sacrament
Swallow, but nothing's forgiven
You and I can't decide which of us was taken for granted
Make amends, some of us are destined to be outlived

Step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times, we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore

Under the words of men
Something is tempting the father
Where is your will, my friend?
Insatiates never even bother
You and I, wrong or right
Traded a lie for the leverage
In between the lens in light
You're not what you seem

Step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times, we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil
I'm not your Devil anymore

Your station is abandoned
Fooled you 'cause I know what you've done
Sensation, deprivation
You should've burned when you turned on everyone

So, step inside, see the Devil in I
Too many times, we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the Devil in I
I know you'll find your answers in the end
Step inside, see the Devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your Devil anymore

So step inside, step inside
See the Devil in I
See the Devil in I

// Killpop //

She's sticking needles in her skin
I turn with an ugly grin
Her canvas doesn't leave a lot to fantasy

But her peace of mind
Can't stay inside the lines
It's so confusing
The methods that she's using
She knows she shouldn't leave a mark that I can see

Will she ever find
One million of a kind?
It's cold and lonely
But that's because she told me
Lost inside her dirty world
No one hurts this pretty girl
But her

Oh, she's beautiful
A little better than a man deserves
Oh, I'm not insane
Please tell me she won't change

Maybe I should let her go
But only when she loves me (she loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me (she loves me)

She's drowning in herself again
My God, what a lovely sin
I guess there's nothing left to do, but have my way

She can feel it's right
So she doesn't close her eyes
She smiles and answers
It doesn't seem to matter
Lost inside my dirty head
Something tells me I'm the one who's kept

Oh, so volatile
A little better than a man defiled
Oh I need the pain
Please tell me she won't change

Maybe I should let her go
But only when she loves me (she loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me (she loves me)

We were meant to be together
Now die and fucking love me
We were meant to hurt each other
Now die and fucking love me
Die and fucking love me
Die and fucking love me
Die and fucking love me

// Skeptic //

Pissed!

Only when the fates
Commiserate
Do we get a little taste as unique?
The libertine
Know what I mean?
Hiroshima on a Sunday

You had a gift
You were a gift
But there's always a goddamn catch
Blessing and a curse
You made it work
The universe seems so much smaller

Legend! Bastard! Best friend!
Why?
Why do the limits have to realign?
Hero! Martyr! Mystery!
God, he was the best of us

The world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
The world will never know another man as amazing as you

Never be the same
I want the blame
To be assigned to the guiltiest one
It can't be done
Because the son
Was the victim they arrested

I'm so fucking pissed
At all of this
You gotta know that you are sorely missed
Miracles are real
They help you heal
They make you feel like things will get better

Father! Brother! Scapegoat! Why?
Why did we only get this time?
Fighter! Icon! Skeptic
God, stop taking the best of us

I won't let you disappear
I will keep your soul alive
If I can't have you here
History may have its share
Of lunatics and stars

But the world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
The world will never know another man as amazing as you
The world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
The world will never know another man as amazing as you

Skeptic
Skeptic
Skeptic

Skeptic

Where am I supposed to begin?
I'm killing for the karma again
Feed the meter in the machine
Believing is the way to be seen

Gone â are we alone?
Gone â are we alone?
Gone â are we alone?
Gone â we're not alone

I can't let you disappear
I will keep your soul alive
If I can't have you here
We were meant to be the kings
Rule the masses, run the risks
And keep our systems clean
History may have its share
Of lunatics and stars

But the world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
The world will never know another man as amazing as you
The world will never see another crazy motherfucker like you
The world will never know another man as amazing as you

The world will never see (will never see)
Another crazy motherfucker like you (like you)
Like you (like you)
Like you

// Lech //

I know why Judas wept, motherfucker

The fires burn on the summit
Shining a light on the ones I've killed
Survivor's guilt - undetermined
I could murder the world in all the blood I've spilled

Banishment
Sequestered and conquered
To hell with your intelligence
Just figure out your common sense

No one is bulletproof, yeah

I'll eat the skins of my brothers
The alabaster bones will make a perfect wall
Can I fill in the cracks of these feelings
With every terrible piece or maybe nothing at all?

Selfishness
Take credit for everything
What more could you ask for?
And does it matter anymore?

No one is bulletproof, yeah

Can you feel the cold?
Fortune never favors the old
Tired of defending myself
Go complain to somebody else
Somebody else

The monsters in your madness
Are the voices in your head
They're scratching at your windows
As you hide beneath the bed
You live like fucking heathens
So you'll die like pagan gods
In between the poisons and the pure
Contagions and the cure

Nine for sure 
Nine for sure 
Nine for sure 
Nine for sure 

I got a bone that's dead inside of me
It's a rotting sick that I don't need
Feel free to vent your denigration
I can't believe I'm saying this
I'll live with my regrets
I'll die by my decisions
I'm not your fucking superstar
Keep it close, you're going way too far

No one is bulletproof
Bulletproof
No one is bulletproof
Bulletproof
No one is bulletproof
Bulletproof

// Goodbye //

Come on over
Come unglued
It's not easy
To see all of you

Help yourselves
Help is on the way
Well there's nothing to lose
So now, I have something to say

Maybe we can all recognize a moment of silence
Maybe we can finally agree on the same point of view
A long time ago we believed and we were united
So the last thing on Earth I am ready to do is say goodbye

A long time ago we discovered that nothing could stop us
This hasn't torn us apart, so nothing ever will
How can we know where we are if the sun is behind us?
But this moment will show us the rest of our lives
No one is going to save us this time
No one can know what we're feeling.
So don't even try

// Nomadic //

Let's skip all the histrionics
Not again, not another excuse
The epidemic is co-dependent
Biting off more than your mouth can chew
Don't forget to convalesce your secrets
I don't want to be a man today
For all that you know I'm the silver in the bullet
I am the trigger that will make you all obey

I'm gonna make you cry tonight
I'm gonna make you hate me

Inside all my flaws again
I can't let go
In spite of you, I'm lost again
I still don't know
Disguises show me
What am I if I am only?
The status quo is not a punishment
But now it feels like home

Your association finds you guilty
Started with the end of the day
Black and white is such a fascist feeling
Right or wrong, and nothing to say
The last good bipeds cleaning up the fingerprints
Unappreciated medical fiends
Confiscate another classic inbred
Fuck it all - light the acetylene

No other choice I can't explain
Life keeps taking things away

Inside all my flaws again
I can't let go
In spite of you, I'm lost again
I still don't know
Disguises show me
What am I if I am only?
The status quo is not a punishment
But now it feels like home

"The tough guys who came to kill, but stayed to rape and ravage."

The future's here, I'm past my prime
When the evidence came, I committed the crime
Can you stand on your faith with your feet on the Bible?
Who could ask for a better disciple?
What's the point? I'm not sure I can
I'll never dig another grave, I'm afraid of what I'll find
If it hurts then you're too old
I'll take your shit and give you fucking gold

I'm gonna make you cry tonight
I need you to hate me

Inside all my flaws again
I can't let go
In spite of you, I'm lost again
I still don't know
Disguises show me
What am I if I am only?
The status quo is not a punishment
But now it feels like home
But now it feels like home

// The One That Kills The Least //

I don't seem to care today. I mirror what I love with what I hate
Empty ways can cloud your eyes. I only know because I tried
So come with meâ¦ come with meâ¦
Let's meet our contestants! That have no better time to play the game!

I don't wanna give it away! Underneath the citadelsâ¦
Buried deep with your guilt and regrets
Leading in the dark, everything is wonderful
I don't care - I don't wanna forget
Why is it a crime? It's none of your business
I prefer to be in hell by myself
Turn the other cheek and tell it to somebody who
Refuses to forgive, when nothing was taken

No one else survives - I've seen you live, now watch me die
But we don't see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes - alone in here, I realize
The one that kills the least still kills us all

â¦ Hidden in the rubble, everybody's got a story to tell
What do I need? Eliminate the possible
All that's left is a man in a cell
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe a decision is
The better way to go, the better way to be
I've got my demons - go get your own
Save another number - don't forget to hate me

No one else survives - I've seen you live, now watch me die
But we don't see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes - alone in here, I realize
The one that kills the least still kills us all

No one else survives - I've seen you live, now watch me die
But we don't see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes - lost in here, I realize
The one that kills the least still kills us all
The one that kills the least still kills us all
The one that kills the least still kills us
All all all all

Have this one!
Dat-dat-da, dat-dat-da, dat-dat-da-da-da
Dat-dat-da, dat-dat-da, dat-dat-da-da-da!

Rise

Half-alive and stark-raving free and maligned for encroaching on the purpose of this commercial-free interruption
Due to the prolific nature of this statement listener aggression is advised

It's strange, whenever I see a gun
I think about just how petty you are
And it blows my fucking mind!
Yeah, it blows my fucking mind!
These days I never seem to get enough
I'm tired of this shit, I wanna go home
Don't waste my fucking time!
Don't waste my fucking time!

Because anything exceptional
Gets crushed by common people
With jealousy and ignorance
And all their common evils
This planet isn't special
Collections made of clay
I'm waiting for the punishment
I know it's on my way

Cut, cut, cut me up
And fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up
And fuck, fuck, fuck me up!
Cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up

Irreverence is my disease
It's second-hand, but you know me
The son of a bitch is on his knees
The last man standing gets no pity

Somewhere on a toilet wall
I read the words
'You form a line to formalize the former lies.'
And I finally saw the truth
Something so profound and now it's sitting there
Surrounded by the garbage and the stains
Another victim of the refuse

Now I've been saying this for years
But you don't comprehend it
I fight hell and I fight fear
Because I understand it
Androgyny and insults
You try so hard to be difficult
You wanna win the war?
Know what you're fighting for

Cut, cut, cut me up
And fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up
And fuck, fuck, fuck me up!
Cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up and fuck, fuck, fuck me up

Cut (cut), cut (cut), cut me up
And fuck (fuck), fuck (fuck), fuck me up!
Cut (cut), cut (cut), cut me up
And fuck (fuck), fuck (fuck), fuck me up!

Irreverence is my disease
It's second-hand, but you know me
The son of a bitch is on his knees
The last man standing gets no pity
With angel eyes and demon seeds
You're missing what you really need
When all is said and done, you see
The last man standing gets no pity

No pity
No pity
No pity
No pity
No pity

Cut, cut, cut me up
And fuck, fuck, fuck me up
Cut, cut, cut me up
And fuck, fuck, fuck me up

Cut (cut), cut (cut), cut me up
And fuck (fuck), fuck (fuck), fuck me up!
Cut (cut), cut (cut), cut me up
And fuck (fuck), fuck (fuck), fuck me up!

Cut, cut, cut me up
And fuck, fuck, fuck me up!
Cut, cut, cut me up
And fuck, fuck, fuck me up!

// Be Prepared For Hell //

I can't get out, or I'll die 
Just let me be 
I'll never be never

Be prepared for hell, and I say, "Oh, well
Just tell me when I can open my eyes" and realize I've died 
Be prepared for hell, and I say, "Oh, well
Just tell me when I can open my eyes" and realize I've died

// The Negative One //

Fuck!

Fire and caffeine - a lot of nicotine
I'm gonna burn so I better tell you everything
The competition - the superstition
Never mind 'cause you're never gonna give in
It's a crisis, just how you like it
The same drama in a different disguise
I'm bound to walk with a target on my back
At least I'm ready for another attack

The lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me

Svengali - why are we the enemies?
I never follow and I never make apologies
Your dementias are gonna get you
Because your walls can't support each other
Settle for the cynical - you're so political
You're getting ready 'cause the first move is critical
Reciprocity - somebody's listening
What did we learn from our time in captivity?

The lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me
The negative one and me

I hope you live
To see the day
When your world goes up in flames
And as you die
You see my face
You're the only one to blame
(Fuck)

The prescient
The nascent
The quotient (They all will fall)
The cystic, symbolic, condition (Systemic)
Egregious, replete with
These lesions (Contaminate)
Succumb to the selfish
Creation (Your failure)

No accountability - divisibility
I point a finger but it's always looking back at me
The centipede's pulling on the mechanism
Unearthing scars of the cataclysm
When the innocent begin to circumvent
The color fades, but the picture is vibrant
What do you believe? Does it matter now?
Turn away - the killer is disavowed

The lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me
The negative one and me

I hope you live
To see the day
When your world goes up in flames
And as you die
You see my face
You're the only one to blame

The lord of lies (The lord of lies)
The morning star (The morning star)
You had to be set free
You had to be set free
Opposing sides (Opposing sides)
Your choices are (Your choices are)
The negative one (The negative one)
The negative one (The negative one)
The negative one (The negative one)
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
And me

// If Rain Is What You Want //

It's been years since anyone could be a friend
It's the fear that kills the feeling in the end
Can we face it? Can we shape it? Can we really die?
If rain is what you want
All you have to do is close your eyes
Just close your eyes

I am watching resurrection start to crawl
Is there any chance in hell? Any chance at all?
Do we need it? Do we see it? Is it really there?
If rain is what you want
Then take your seats, enjoy the fall
Enjoy the fall

Enjoy the fall

The only thing deeper than my last breath
The only thing darker than my last death
Is the panic, the static
I've come back from the dead
But my cities will never sleep again

In these diamonds we're left with coloured glass
As pressure takes its toll, we will outlast
But you can't break my heart
As long as I can be myself, I'll never fall apart
And you can't take me in
If I'm not broken, break me down
So I will never feel alone again

The only thing deeper than my last breath
The only thing darker than my last death
Is the panic, the static,
I've come back from the dead
But my cities will never sleep again
My cities will never sleep again
My cities will never sleep again
My cities will never sleep again
My cities will never sleep again

// Override //

The ghosts have given up
Familiar haunts have had enough
Too much thought will give you doubt
Now they found you
It's safer in a cage
They can tell you what to say
All your dreams come with a price, so they own you
But what did you expect?
Was it too much to protect?
Did you understand they had selfish intentions?
When they were pulling you in opposite directions

You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
We are the override
We are the override

The dead don't know, the dead are lonely
A fascination fades
When this mercy execution says it's over
You follow as preferred
Now their plans are undeterred
Who can bring them in to supersede? It's over
Even hate starts out as love
Sometimes when it's all you want
Maybe satisfaction will take you for granted
When all that's left is the emotion you abandoned

You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
We are the override
We are the override

You clawed out from nothing and I sent you back
Fought to the metal, and law's what you lacked
Covered in sores - you cannot be the one
You are the answer to why we have risen
You are not the way
You are judged to be afraid
You are simple and unchanged
We believe you should give up
Give up, give up, give up, give up
Satisfaction will take you for granted
When all that's left is a life you abandoned

You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
We are the override
We are the override

Give up
Give up
Give up
Give up
Give up
Give up
Give up
Give up

// The Burden //

(There's God)
(There's God)
(There's God)

There's God
Can I feed you again?
Will I have to stay dumb?
You can feel, and it begins
But I know inside this heart attack
I can see through your eyes
I'm terrified of everything
But it's no real surprise
Because the parasites are dancing closer
All this sacrilegion warns in posters
Can you handle it?

In the dark
Why I think I'm alone?
I sweat through my visions
I'm going too cold
Today is a tragedy
In the mouth of the mad
But that doesn't matter now
I've come home relaxed
I'm curled up in a ball and shaking
I'm hiding from the hell I'm making
I can't believe the chance I'm taking
Is there any other way? Is there any other way?

The burden
The burden

You can't save me
There is nothing more to give
I am changing
Almost like I never lived
Be my witness
Just don't leave me in suspense
Keep this, prove it
Tell them all the consequences

The burden
Have you ever been burdened before?
The burden
Was there anything you wanted more?

You can't save me
There is nothing more to give
I am changing
Almost like I never lived
Be my witness
Just don't leave me in suspense
Keep this, prove it
Tell them all the consequences

Our same plea
By now you know that looks are deceiving
I'm covered in a rash and receding
Is there any other way? Is there any other way?
For God's sake, we've suffered, this pain is now our lives
For God's sake, we've suffered enough
For God's sake, we've suffered, this pain is now our lives
For God's sake, we've suffered enough
For God's sake, we've suffered, this pain is now our lives
For God's sake, we've suffered enough
For God's sake, we've suffered, this pain is now our lives
For God's sake, we've suffered enough, enough, enough, enough

[Guy:] 'Cause I still have some uh, if I can remember where they are, I think they're in weggy back home in Texas and in the vault is some uncut stuff, y'know? Just like it's already on CDs

[Band member:] Mm

[Guy:] All it's gotta do is be produced, y'know'm'saying?

[Band member:] Yeah. Yeah

[Guy:] Yeah I got probably a hundred of 'em in uh... and I write, when I write I write extras... but all I put out was about six CDs, maybe seven

[Band member:] Right

[Guy:] To me that's it. Y'know?

[Band member:] Yeah

[Guy:] That's 10-year deal. That's a career in 10 years. Ha-ha

[Band member:] Yeah, exactly!

[Guy:] Six CDs, y'know? I'm Bob Seger. My son's Bob Seger!

[Band member:] Really!?

[Guy:] Yeah! When I wrote all the Bob Seger's, I hired this other guy that's like a Portugal guy. Well, I fired him after the first two CDs Bob came out with. I paid him uh... I paid him three million for two CDs. He's fucking good, man! But he make a lot for sure he was a child molester, man and I just... y'know, man I said, "Hey, dude. You gotta go, man." So I hired my son. My son works at Thailand's in Texas. And uh, he finished off those last five CDs of Bob Seger

[Band member:] Cool, man. Good luck to you, man

[Guy:] Yeah. I'll be back. Cool. I gotta go get me some rehabilitation and some new lessons

[Band member:] Yup

[Guy:] I used to work over there, man! That's my shop-my old shop! Down on Hollywood Vine right there

[Band member:] Yeah

[Guy:] You walk in there, and that first little creature down on the bottom, that's me back in the seventies, dude! Bad Company! Started out with Bad Company up in Detroit. Came down here, and joined two other bands. I played just in studio on rhythm

[Band member:] Wow!

[Guy:] Yeah. Bad trouble on Bad Company, man. Fuckin' cocaine habit. Fuckin'... ha-ha-ha

[Band member:] Yeah. That'll do it. That'll do it

[Guy:] You know what I mean, right? You get out on the road out there, and you're in that bus man, your shit

[Band member:] Yeah

[Band member:] So you were in Bad Company?

[Guy:] Yeah!

[Band member:] What'd you play for 'em?

[Guy:] Rhythm

[Band member:] Guitar?

[Guy:] Yeah. I play rhythm like a motherfucker, dude. I was uh, I just was re-certified in '85, let's see, maybe it was '85, for rhythm, for number seven all-time rhythm guitar player-Slash! Ha-ha-ha

[Band member:] Yeah

[Guy:] Yeah that was my name back then with Bob Seger. Um, Homer Deck, he used to play too! He's from Germany, but he's all fucked up now, too. I knew him back when we were ridin' bikes. I used to ride bikes, man. Got in trouble... ha-ha-ha
