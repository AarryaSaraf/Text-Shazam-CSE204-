// Insert Coin //

I'm counting all the killers...

// Unsainted //

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I'll never kill myself to save my soul)
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I didn't come this far to sink so low)
I'm finally holding on to letting go

I'm just weathering a rough patch
Another villain with an itch to scratch
Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole
Why does the hell make you feel so cold?
Make a move and you pay for it
Pick a lord and you pray to it
You're so demanding when you want the truth
But your stories don't read for me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

Indecision overload
Keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road
Reaching out for the hand of God
But did you think you'd shake your own?
This killing field is all grown over
The motherfucker wants it wild
Go sow your oats in alphabetical order
The anti-antagonist is back in style
Myopic, cannot see straight
Dystopic, one sin too late
You gotta lie if you wanna believe
But your bibles don't work on me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

Did you think you could win? And fill me in?
Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin
I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me
I was more than you thought I could be
So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?
You've killed the saint in me

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?

// Birth Of The Cruel //

(Let him crave understanding
Let him crave your wisdom
Let him crave
Let him... promote
Father... my self-control)

I'm just a Judas, looking for a silver line
And tomorrow is still a step behind
Hey hey drama, I'd love to be a waste of your time
Oh no, thanks so much for wasting mine
So hear me out

Let's hear it for the damaged
Who understands but the broken?
Developed in the arms of spite
I'm all fucked up and I make it look good
Adrenalin sight tonight

I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it

Sick, sickened, I'm sickening, I'm stricken by the fist
Blessed are the fires that have burned me
Listen to this, the lesson is, never underestimate the agony
Death of the fool, birth of the cruel

Remember how you spent the best part of forever in a state of pure disease
It was another thing altogether to forget that you brought out the worst in me
Hey Karma, you don't feel like I do
You just wish you'd hate like I do

We are the Bitter, the maladjusted and wise
Fighting off a generation too uptight
We're all dressed up with nobody to kill
The rhetoric stops tonight

I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it

Sick, sickened, I'm sickening, I'm stricken by the fist
Blessed are the fires that have burned me
Listen to this, the lesson is, never underestimate the agony
Death of the fool, birth of the...
Birth of the cruel!
Yeah!

Now's not the time for denying
Shifting the focus to scare
Let's not forget we're all guilty
All three dimensions polluted by earnest despair

I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm overthrown
I'm over your throne
I'm over it

(Let him crave understanding
Let him crave your wisdom
Let him crave
Let him... promote
Father... my self-control
That he can see and look at the enemy in front of him
And just goes, "Not today, sucker
Go back to Hell where you belong!")

// Death Because Of Death //

Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of death because of you
Death because of you

// Nero Forte //

Watch this!

I'm never enough
You bleed me dry, using me up
Dissatisfied, and used
Another key to the empty spot in you
I'm sick as a fuck
I'm in my prime, what do you want?
I guess it's time, to see
If you're lost in hell you'll find no peace

Ooh, wade through hate and fear
I haven't felt like this in years
Not much left, so uprooted
Fists clenched tight in the pockets of my hoodie
And I know where I need to go
But the voice of reason can't say no
It's in the eyes, and heart
Just the latest psycho off the charts

That's what you do best!

A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

I know, and even if I didn't
I would lie so, many would believe it
Stand up and resist the chains
Of all the people in belligerent sick restraint
I wasn't enough
You bled me dry, which way is up?
Oh, you're a lie, and fake
I hope the truth is not too late

That's what you do best!

A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best
A home like yours is upside down
Too much animosity
Nobody does it better than the enemy
A hope like yours won't help me now
You can do your worst to me
At the end of the day, that's what you do best

That's what you do best!

That's what you do best...
That's what you do best... Hahahahahaha...

(WHY) Why was it easy for you?
(DID) Did I deserve the abuse?
(I) I can't believe I let it
(NOT) Not what I wanted

// Critical Darling //

Yeah!

God's in a coma
Put Faith in a life support
Running away won't feel the same
If you reach a metaphysical last resort
Oh, malevolence and purgatory give you pause
It's a miracle you haven't broken any laws
We are not entitled to surviving
So keep your friends and your enemies thriving

(Good for you!) What a clichÃ©...
(Just not true!) What a giveaway!
(What comes now!) Can't be the last one
Falling down!

Every time this happens I'm breaking a promise I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet and keep it away from the leeches who want to deceive?

What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven

Once again, we got suffocated
In a sick perversion of a spider's web
Crawling over all the spent, digested pieces
Celebrate the dead
Here come all the judging eyes
Gotta pave the road with your best intentions
I only wish you could picture a future
That doesn't resemble your crazy inventions

(Good on you!) I don't mean it...
(Dream come true!) I don't need it!
(What goes up!) Another Hollow One
Must come down!

Every time this happens I'm breaking a promise I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet and keep it away from the leeches who want to deceive?

What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven

A mirror only works if you open your eyes
But even then you have to understand what's inside
The easy part is always hardest to see
I know you'll never guess, but darling
You're so critical
Darling, you're so critical
Oh, you're so critical

Oh, this is a cave-in
The weight of the catalyst
Just wait, let the games begin
Gonna tell you all about it for the savages

(Good for you!) Not another one...
(Just not true!) Not another one!
(What comes now!) This world is
Falling down!

Every time this happens I'm breaking a promise I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet and keep it away from the leeches who want to deceive?

What is coming has begun
It's something that you gotta see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven

It's begun!

Oh, you're so critical!
Yeah!
Oh, you're so critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!
Critical!

// A Liar's Funeral //

The season at an end
A harvest of seclusion and regret
The burning can begin
A period of ash is what you get
The quiet is a curse
But my respect was shown to you by force
Another day too late
Another neck too eager for the rope

Liar
Liar

Yesterday was hard
Tomorrow is just a promise of the same
When friends have all subscribed
To spitting on the ground to say my name
Fire on the ice
December in the summer kills the heart
Your hate is no surprise
I guess I have to die to play my part

Liar
Liar

Ooh, close your eyes and join the blind
Slit your wrists for peace of mind
Turn your back and show us the truth
There's only one way to remember it for you

Burn, burn, burn, the liar
Burn, burn, burn, the liar
Burn, burn, burn, the liar
Burn, burn, burn, the liar

Hold the weight
Never trust the one beside you
Carried away
You know just as much as I do
Hold the weight
Do it all for what you really love
Carried away
Use you up until you've had enough

Hold the weight
Never trust the one beside you
Carried away
You know just as much as I do
Hold the weight
Do it all for what you really love
Carried away
Use you up until you've had enough

Clench your teeth and tighten your grip
Stand up straight, don't let it slip
Burn, burn, burn, the liar
Burn, burn, burn, the liar

True victims and survivors learn to make war
Don't wanna be the Sad Man Singing anymore
I did it all wrong so I'd get it all right
We're wasting all the candles, the dead need no light

Liar
Liar
Liar

// Red Flag //

Yeah!

Past just saving, this is like escaping
Running wild in the middle of weeds
Eyes can't see me, careful with your breathing
Get away or they get to feed
Strength's not enough, be defiant
You're looking for a reason to suffer, you'll find it
But if you want to live to be better, begin it
Your energy won't keep you from getting exhausted and purge it

You don't own me!
You can't hold me!
This is beginning!
You are an ending!

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

(Vultures, vultures, vultures, vultures
Vultures, vultures, vultures, vultures)

Vultures salivate poison to exterminate
It's the dawn of the Renaissance
Emancipation, cattle on displacement, you want
To reason but there is no response
I won't allow this to happen
Another situation I feel like I'm trapped in
Nothing is my business and business is gone
I wish you all could fuck off and go back to hell where you belong!

You don't own me!
You can't hold me!
This is beginning!
You are an ending!

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

Plague! (Plague!) Don't panic (Plague!)
Don't believe the riddle that confuses you
Bitch! (Bitch!) So manic (So manic!)
I can see the light that exposes you
So dramatic, now it's all emphatic means
The bigger the mouth that I can eat you with
Force of habit, God you reek of your havoc
But consider the sources you've been tampering with!

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing

They'll smother their own just to feel you (Just to feel you...)
They'll get you alone just to steal you (Just to steal you...)
They'll eat you alive just to kill you (Just to kill you...)
Nobody will ever have you
You used to be something special
Now you're nothing new

Now you're nothing!
Now you're nothing!
Now you're nothing new!
New!
Oh!
Yeah!

// Spiders //

Well you can go it alone
Or keep it in between
The pages of the books you burn
So no one gets to read
The fingers pull your stitches tight
But knowing someone's secret is not enough
Everyone's a little bit a lot of the time

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

When now is not the time
Tomorrow disagrees
But your real world isn't ready to face
The face behind the real me
Time to think it over
I'm over trying to overthink, I've had enough, huh
Everybody's limited to what's on their mind

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

(Spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)
(Spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)

Make yourself a martyr's pet
And watch them all escape (spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)
Make yourself at home instead (spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)
You'll lose your toxic waste (spiders, spiders, spiders, spiders)

Go it alone
Suffer for your feelings, I'm not enough (no, no, no)
But everyone's a little bitter all of the time

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?
The spiders come in side by side
Two by two and night by night
Who is food and who is thrown away?

// Orphan //

I wept! When I realized
There were no more demons left to conquer
An opportunity to show my feelings
With skin so thick you'd swear it was armor
A penitentiary that only lets the oxygen out
I wasn't ready for a version of the truth to get out
I'm getting desperate, I wouldn't want to fester
In another bad dream, I am a man of extremes

I found the flesh and I'm liking it
I'll put an end to all your fucking psychobabble
We eat the meat 'cause the meat had a soul
We take their lives 'cause to hurt makes us whole

I am not the same
You never had a clue or knew my name
You wanna know the story, take my pain
I am ready, the lie is heard
I am not the same
You never had intent to keep my blame
You really wanna know who the fuck I am?
I am the orphan, the one who kills your world

Keeping up appearances with acts of attrition
It doesn't matter 'cause I know you'll never listen
Before, you knew it when you saw it
Now you say you never knew it, it was all a big conspiracy
We come together when the hands of pain let go
Is there anybody left to fill this hole?
This shit will never wash off
Give yourself a medal, I swear I fucking give up

We're nothing special, just an accidental tweak of the freak
An evolution of the kennel in the fetish you seek
There's still the part of me that's dying in a dumpster
The one who rose is a motherfucking monster

I've seen the future, and it's simply burning!
I wasn't put here to be so discerning!
You want the world to be dissatisfied?!
You don't care, so why the fuck should I?
Fuck, should I sell myself to stay alive?

I am not the same
You never had a clue or knew my name
You wanna know the story, take my pain
I am ready, the lie is heard
I am not the same
You never had intent to keep my blame
You really wanna know who the fuck I am?
I am the orphan, the one who kills...
The one who kills your world!

Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything

Tell me all about it
I'd love to hear it
The way I ruin everything I touch
I never thought I'd get to say I'm sorry
But then again I think you ask too much

Too white 2B black
Too black 2B blue
Too sick 2B me
Too fucked 2B you
I only wonder if I'll live to see the end of the road
It always gets me nowhere

I am not the same
You never had a clue or knew my name
You wanna know the story, take my pain
I am ready, the lie is heard
I am not the same
You never had intent to keep my blame
You really wanna know who the fuck I am?
I am the orphan, the one who kills your world

Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
I am the orphan, the one who kills...
Everyone has something
Someone here has everything
I am the orphan, the one who kills...

Yeah-hahahaha...

// My Pain //

Pain
She loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free to feel all of my pain

I'm your friend
And I'm your shade
Do what you want
Just remember it's for love

I'm your wall
And I'm your rock
Don't run away
Don't forget it's only love

I'm your chain
And I'm your lock
There's no escape
Just as long as I say... love

I'm your death
And I'm your cold
You end with me
Remember: this was never love
(Love, love, love, love)

I'll take this
(Love, love, love, love)
And I'll take that
(Love, love, love, love)
I'll take you too
(Love, love, love)
You can never give too much

Pain
She loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free
Pain

Pain
She loves me
Wants me to be
Less scared, more free to feel all of my pain

I've always felt love this way for you

// Not Long For This World //

Cutting or scratching, they scar the same
The angle is off, the edges are soft, the mark remains
I know I'm bitter and full of rage
You would be too, what I've been through
Knowledge is a difficult age

So decide
Tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide
Tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see...
Not long for this world!

Carving or biting, we bleed for keeps
Out of control, into the cold, hell repeats
God, I'm starving, spreading me thin
Buying a story, my soul is for sale
Trust is such an arrogant thing

So decide
Tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide
Tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see...
Not long for this world!
Not long for this world!

I KNOW THE SHIT YOU EAT
There's nothing mellow in the
DRAMA YOU LIVE AND BREATHE
You like your secrets to be
KEPT IN THE FAMILY
You don't get credit for your
RARE GOOD BEHAVIOR, GO BE A SAVIOR
You don't seem to get what I'm saying...
And I'm sick and tired of explaining!
GOODNIGHT, GOODBYE, GOOD LUCK
There's nothing worse than a
GHOUL MANIFESTO, I'M NOT IMPRESSED THOUGH

The greatest conclusion that I ever had
Was when I woke up and said, "That's enough!"
Living never felt so bad
You don't accept it, and I don't care
Bury yourself above all your guilt
When you're ready it'll be there

So decide
Tell me how I'm gonna die
'Cause I've already gone away
Decide
Tell me how you loved a lie
It wasn't really hard to see
Hard to see...
Not long for this world!
Not long for this world!
Not long for this world!

I was not long for this world...
I was not long for this world...

I was not long for this world!
I was not long for this world!
I was not long for this world!
I was not long for this world!

// Solway Firth //

Today, up on this hill, I'm counting all the killers
They sway as they swarm, a look of gluttons in their eyes
They mutter as the body loses warmth
They pick your bones like locks inside a tomb
And take great care to not take care of you
Here's an unexplainable one
Here's an unexplainable one

While I was learning to live, we all were living a lie
I guess you got what you wanted
So I will settle for a slaughterhouse soaked in blood and betrayal
It's always somebody else, somebody else was me
You want the real smile?
Or the one I used to practice not to feel like a failure?

I don't need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don't need you to hide it from me
I just want to feel like any other man
I won't show you the whole story
I won't show you the aftermath
I won't show you my allegory
Don't look away

Here's an unexplainable one
Here's an unexplainable one
Here's an unexplainable one

I'm not ahead of my time, I just drew the first breath
If I'm alive tomorrow
I will alleviate the pressure by cutting you out of me
I found my bottom line dead on the front lines
I know I'll never go home
So set fire to your ships and past regrets and be free

I don't need you to do it for me
I don't need you to understand
I don't need you to hide it from me
I just want to feel like any other man
I won't show you my whole story
I won't show you the aftermath
I won't show you my allegory
Don't look away

Here's an unexplainable one
What have you done?
What have you done?
Yeah

Oh, while I was learning to live, you taught me how to die
I guess I got what I wanted
Another needle in the back through purified scarification
It wasn't somebody else, you fucking did it to me
You want a real smile?
I haven't smiled in years

// All Out Life //

What a world, the horizon's
Coming like a hell-bent killing machine
Can't afford to be the goddamn wreckage
Burn it all again at a million degrees
Calling all the adamant upper-level
Undefeated counterfeit cunts with a reason to fear
Throw away all the meaningless shit that's clinging
The enemy is here, I said stop

Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
One by one against, give me the name
All you shiny pretty never-wills ruined the game
You hold all the keys, so the chains shouldn't hold you
I know you heard me, I fucking told you

Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
No excuses, I challenge you to all out fucking life

Drop that shit and put it on a pedestal
Children are afraid of the gods
Raise your hands and show me what's impossible
That makes us even, never tell me the odds
What a bore, I'm getting stuck in a metaphor
I don't wanna go to sleep
I need a breakdown quick in negotiations
Get it all together and remember to seethe, stop

Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
Drive by violence, more of the same
I can see where you're going, and I'm really ashamed
Do you think when you act or just act like you're thinking?
I gotta know now, you better tell me

Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
I challenge you to all out life

We are gathered here today to get it right
Repeat after me:
"I will not celebrate mediocrity
I will not worship empty shells
I will not listen to worthless noises
I will not subject myself to selected predictable choices
My time, my attention
My quality should not be bought and sold
For convenience's sake, ever"

We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind
We are not your kind

Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
Pay attention, it's gonna be a while 'til I really feel alright
Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
No excuses, I challenge you to all out fucking life

All out life, yeah
I challenge you to all out fucking life, yeah
Live, live, live, life
