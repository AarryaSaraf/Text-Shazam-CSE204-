// Prelude 3.0 //

I don't know why I never told you
I don't know why I never tried
When we shed these bitter skins again (Skins again)
All the reasons come to life

But now, it's over
Now it's over
Now it's over
Now it's over

I don't know why you never asked me
And I don't know why you never cared
When we hide these little sins again (Sins again)
All the reasons have to die

But now, it's over
Now it's over
Now it's over
Now it's over
Now it's over
And now, it's over
Now, it's over
And now it's over

No
No
No
No
No

// The Blister Exists //

One, two, three
Yeah
Drop it

Bones in the water and dust in my lungs
Absorbing archaic like a sponge
The ultimate way is the way you control
But can you stay if you detach your soul?
Bury the present and squeeze out the past
The ones you endear to never last
Chemical burns and the animalistic
I'm just another hardline pseudo-statistic

Can you feel this?
I'm dying to feel this
Can you feel this?

Blood on the paper and skin on my teeth
Trying to commit to what's beneath
To find the time is to lose the momentum
You learn the lessons and immediately forget them
Automatic and out of my reach
Consult all the waste to find the key
Minimal life and the polysyllabic
I'm just another blank page, push the button, pull the rage

Can you feel this?
I'm dying to feel this
Can you feel this?

I am all, but what am I?
Another number that isn't equal to any of you
I control, but I comply
Pick me apart then pick up the pieces, I'm uneven

I am the damaged one
All my life and the damage done
I am the damaged one
All my life and the damage done
I am the damaged one
All my life and the damage done
I am the damaged one
All my life and the damage done

Can you feel this?
I'm dying to feel this
Can you feel this?
I'm dying to feel this
Can you feel this?
I'm dying to feel this
Can you feel this?

I am all, but what am I?
Another number that isn't equal to any of you
I control, but I comply
Pick me apart then pick up the pieces, I'm uneven
I am all, but what am I?
Another number that isn't equal to any of you
I control, but I comply
Pick me apart then pick up the pieces, I'm uneven

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

// Three Nil //

One, two, three, nil

Chaos, it's just the beginning
Every promise I made I'm rescinding
Center mass in the middle of the monster
I'm getting tired of drowning the constant
Cry for help, it's debatable
The only reason that you love me is I'm hated by all
Come on, come see dysfunction
I guess we're gonna leave it open for discussion
Who am I? Where am I going?
Maybe I'm looking in the wrong direction
Maybe I'm looking for any direction

This is not my war
This is not my fight
This is something more
This is not my life
This is not my revolution
This is not my convolution
This is not my expectation
This is not my desperation

Yeah! Holed up, scarred and tamed for the hell of it
Look at me, I am the glorified malcontent
Save me? Save this
All I gotta do is give up and all is forgiven
I'm sick of being the butt of a cosmic joke
And I don't get the punchline
A million people lined up for miles
To see the great big mouth shut up and apologize

This is not my war
This is not my fight
This is something more
This is not my life
This is not my revolution
This is not my convolution
This is not my only reason to question why
Today I said goodbye, goodbye

Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today, I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today I said goodbye

Yeah

I'm the pariah, break me
I am the liar, save me
I can take anything, make me
Accuse me of everything, kill me
Cut off the system, enslave me
Deny my existence, waste me
I won't be afraid, try me
I won't be unmade, deny me
So come on, break it off
Come on, buy the lie
Come on, say it, say it
Come on, say goodbye

Goodbye
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today I said goodbye

One, two, three, nil
Yes

// Duality //

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside
If the pain goes on

I have screamed until my veins collapsed
I've waited as my time's elapsed
Now all I do is live with so much fate
I've wished for this, I've bitched at that
I've left behind this little fact
You cannot kill what you did not create

I've gotta say what I've gotta say
And then I swear I'll go away
But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise
I guess I'll save the best for last
My future seems like one big past
You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!

Put me back together or separate the skin from bone
Leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone
Tell me the reality is better than the dream
But I found out the hard way, nothing is what it seems!

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!

All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane!
All I've got, all I've got is insane!
All I've got, all I've got is insane!
All I've got, all I've got is insane!

I push my fingers into my eyes
It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache
But it's made of all the things I have to take
Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside
If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it!

All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane
All I've got, all I've got is insane!
All I've got, all I've got is insane!

// Opium Of The People //

Come on!

Watch those idiosyncrasies
Watch all the idiots fall on me
Running out of ways to get outta the way
Take another shot just to stay the same
But I need some balance - back it off
Fill your lungs 'til it makes you cough
Tell me everything's gonna be alright
'Cause I don't think I'll make it through tonight

The only way
Is all the way!
The only way
Is all the way!
The only way (The only way)
Is all the way! (Is all the way)
The only way (The only way)
Is all the way!
Oh my God!

It's judgment day, and I'm not prepared
Everybody out there's runnin' scared
So take a little bit off the top
I don't care, just make it stop

I won't give another soul to you (I will never)
I won't give another life to you

No, you have to stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!

Do one thing, and say something cryptic
But the styles always clash
One thing I know for sure
The hypothetical won't work anymore
One wrong move, and they will pound
My nails are tight inside my wrists
This sacrament is sacrilege and sentimental
Deity experimental, faith is accidental

I won't give another soul to you (I will never)
I won't give another life to you (I will never)
I won't give another thought to you (I will never)
I won't give any more of my hope to you

// Circle //

Give me the dust of my father
Stand on the face of the ancients
Bare the secret flesh of time itself

Follow me (follow me)
I've come so far, I'm behind again
Follow me (follow me)
I wish so hard I'm there again
Follow me (follow me)
Follow me (follow me)

All that I wanted were things I had before
All that I needed I never needed more
All of my questions are answers to my sins
All of my endings are waiting to begin

I know the way but I falter
I can't be afraid of my patience
There's a sacred place Razel keeps safe

Follow me (follow me)
I've seen so much I'm blind again
Follow me (follow me)
I feel so bad I'm alive again
Follow me (follow me)

All that I wanted were things I had before (Oh, oh)
All that I needed, I never needed more (Oh, oh)

// Welcome //

Yeah!

I am a product - of your conduct
The uncontrollable urges that made me
Have made us all - Are you proud? Do you even care?
You taught us all to lie - that's how we made it here
You should've buried the truth with your secrets
But you were far too impressed with your pretense
Now as far as I know, I don't know anything
'Cause you made damn sure I wasn't anything

Distractions, reactions!
The only way to go is to go away!
Discarded, retarded!
Before I let you go, you have to let me!
(Yeah!)

Clawed away from human clay
We are the broken shards the art disarray
Before you condemn, you rape them, feed us meconium
Stunt our growth from our souls to our throat - cut!
You shouldn't wall us up with your apathy
But you did, and now you're only growing enemies
This is the catalyst, the alpha, the first breed
'Cause you made damn sure, now we're everything

Distractions, reactions
The only way to go is to go away
Discarded, retarded
Before I let you go, you have to let me!
Much to my surprise, I will wake up
And follow the path of the ones I am made of
This time... I won't give in
I will save you from my sins

What is wrong with this?
Manipulation
Violence and chaotic
Go!

Ensconced... ('Onch) in all that's wrong (Wrong)
I slam you shut... (Shut) I can only take so much
How many times do I have to mistreat you?
Constantly biting my hand as I feed you
Maybe now, you'll understand severity
I'll sum it up with the best of amount of brevity
Welcome to the transformation
Welcome to annihilation
Welcome to the man that wanted
Everything, but couldn't have it

Distractions, reactions
The only way to go is to go away
Discarded, retarded
Before I let you go, you have to let me!
Much to my surprise, I will wake up
And follow the path of the ones I am made of
This time... I won't give in
I will save you from my sins (Yeah!)

Save you from my sins! (Yeah!)
Oh, save you from my sins!

// Vermilion //

She seems dressed in all the rings of past fatalities
So fragile yet so devious, she continues to see
Climatic hands that press her temples and my chest
Enter the night that she came home, forever
Oh, she's the only one that makes me sad!

She is everything and more, the solemn hypnotic
My Dahlia bathed in possession, she is home to me
I get nervous, perverse, when I see her, it's worse, but the stress is astounding
It's now or never she is coming home, forever
Oh, she's the only one that makes me sad!
(What am I doing here?
She's my imagination come alive
What am I doing? What am I doing here?
She's my imagination come alive
My imagination come alive, come alive)

Hard to say what caught my attention
Fixed and crazy, aphid attraction
Carve my name in my face (carve my name) to recognize
Such a pheromone cult to terrorize (terrorize)

I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me!

Yeah!

I'm a slave, and I am a master
No restraints and unchecked collectors
I exist through my need (I exist) to self-oblige
She is something in me (I despise) that I despise

I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me (I won't let this build up inside of me)
I won't let this build up inside of me
Won't let this build up inside of me
Won't let this build up inside of me
Won't let this build up inside of me!

She isn't real!
I can't make her real!

She isn't real!
I can't make her real!
She isn't real (She isn't real)
I can't make her real (I can't make her real)
She isn't real (She isn't real)
I can't make her real (I can't make her real)

// Pulse Of The Maggots //

This is the year where hope fails you
The test subjects run the experiments
And the bastard you know is the hero you hate
But cohesion is possible if we try
There's no reason, there's no lesson
No time like the present, tell me right now
What have you got to lose?
What have you got to lose except your soul?
Who's with us?

I fight for the unconventional
My right and it's unconditional
I can only be as real as I can
The disadvantage is I never knew the plan
This isn't just a way to be a martyr
I can't walk alone any longer
I fight for the ones who can't fight
And if I lose, at least I tried!

(We) we are the new diabolic
(We) we are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life, you can have it
(We) we are the pulse of the maggots

I won't be the inconsequential
I won't be the wasted potential
I can make it as severe as I can
Until you realize you'll never take a stand
It isn't just a one-sided version
We've dealt with a manic subversion
I won't let the truth be perverted
And I won't leave another victim deserted

(We) we are the new diabolic
(We) we are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life, you can have it
(We) we are the pulse of the maggots

(Do you understand?) Yes
(Do you understand?) Yes
(Do you understand?) Yes
(Do you understand?) Yes

Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)

We fight 'til no one can fight us
We live and no one can stop us
We pull when we're pushed too far
And the advantage is, the bottom line is
We never had to fight in the first place
We only had to spit back at their face
We won't walk alone any longer
What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger

(We) we are the new diabolic
(We) we are the bitter bucolic
If I have to give my life, you can have it
(We) we are the pulse of the maggots

(Do you understand?) Yes
(Do you understand?) Yes
(Do you understand?) Yes
(Do you understand?) Yes

Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)
Say it again, say it again
(We won't die)

// Before I Forget //

Go!

Stapled shut, inside an outside world and I'm
Sealed in tight, bizarre but right at home
Claustrophobic, closing in and I'm
Catastrophic, not again
I'm smeared across the page, and doused in gasoline
I wear you like a stain, yet I'm the one who's obscene
Catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections,
I've got no time to lose, and I'm just caught up in all the cattle

Fray the strings
Throw the shapes
Hold your breath
Listen!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!

I'm ripped across the ditch, and settled in the dirt and I'm
I wear you like a stitch, yet I'm the one who's hurt
Pay attention to your twisted little indiscretions
I've got no right to win, I'm just caught up in all the battles

Locked in clutch
Pushed in place
Hold your breath
Listen!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!

My end
It justifies my means
All I ever do is delay
My every attempt to evade
The end of the road and my end
It justifies my means
All I ever do is delay
My every attempt to evade
The end of the road!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh!

You're wasting it
You're wasting it
You're wasting it
You're wasting it
You're wasting it

// Vermilion, Pt. 2 //

She seemed dressed in all of me
Stretched across my shame
All the torment and the pain
Leaked through and covered me
I'd do anything to have her to myself
Just to have her for myself
Now, I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do when she makes me sad

She is everything to me
The unrequited dream
A song that no one sings
The unattainable
She's a myth that I have to believe in
All I need to make it real is one more reason
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do when she makes me sad

But I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me

I catch in my throat, choke
Torn into pieces
I won't, no
I don't wanna be this

But I won't let this build up inside of me
(I won't let this build up inside of me)
I won't let this build up inside of me
(I won't let this build up inside of me)
I won't let this build up inside of me
(I won't let this build up inside of me)
I won't let this build up inside of me

(I won't let this build up inside of me)
(I won't let this build up inside of me)
(I won't let this build up inside of me) She isn't real
(I won't let this build up inside of me) I can't make her real
(I won't let this build up inside of me) She isn't real
(I won't let this build up inside of me) I can't make her real

Tell me, tell me that you want to
Ha-ha-ha, shh, wait, wait
Not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet
Yeah

I can see you, but you can't see me
I could touch you, and you wouldn't even feel me
Wait a second and you'll settle down
I'm just waiting 'til you really let your guard down
You're relaxed, you're sublime, you're amazing
You don't even know the danger you're facing
If I'm quiet, I'll slide up behind you
And if you hear me, I'll enjoy trying to find you
I've been with you all day
I'm trying to stay calm
I'm impatient, and it's really hard to breathe
I'm going to empty you and fill you in with me
Just keep the violence down
Not yet, don't make a sound
Oh God, I'm feeling it
It's reaching fever pitch
My skin is caving in
My heart is driving out
No mercy, no remorse
Let nature take its course

Waiting - I am your disease
Lover - set my symptom free
Covered - you can't love me

Shh, wait, shh, no
Wait, wait, no
Shh, wait, wait, not yet
No, wait, wait

I'm sweating through my veins
I'm trying to hold on
It's unbearable, it's almost worse for me
I'm gonna tear you apart and make you see
Make you see

Bring me to my knees
Waiting - I am your disease
Lover - set my symptom free
Covered - you can't love me

The virus of life
This is inside us

This is the virus

This is inside us

It's almost time to play
It's time to be afraid
I can't control the pain
I can't control in vain
Oh God, I'm ready now
You're almost ready now
I'm gonna love you now
I'm gonna put you down
I see you in the dark
I see you all the way
I see you in the light
I see you plain as day
I wanna touch your face
I wanna touch your soul
I wanna wear your face

// Danger, Keep Away //

We too feel alone
We too feel alone
We too feel alone
We've too feel alone
We too feel alone
We too feel alone

That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine?
That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine?

Where have I been all this time?
Lost enslaved fatal decline
I've been waiting for this to unfold but
The pieces are only as good as the whole
Severed myself from my old life
Cut off the only thing that was bright
What if I never saw you again?
I'd die right next to you in the end

That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine?
That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine?

I won't let you walk away
Without hearing what I have to say
Without hearing what I have to say
Without hearing what I have to say

// Don't Get Close //

Come on!

Somebody give me some light not pointed into dark
Somebody show me the end and I try to push a start
I'm trying to figure out a better way, a better answer
But I keep finding all the problems I've been looking after
You can't wander through the world with nothing but a smile
I'll take your tongue for words and use it to instill denial

Don't get close
You don't know me and you'll never know
Chivalry will get you somewhere
Rivalry will take you there
Don't get close
You don't know me and you'll never know
Chivalry will get you somewhere
Rivalry will take you there

Maybe I should look away before I really miss
Maybe I should pick the time before I pick the place
I bet you all the things that you emulate, you penalize
But I don't wanna go until you learn to finalize

Don't get close
You don't know me and you'll never know
Chivalry will get you somewhere
Rivalry will take you there
Don't get close
You don't know me and you'll never know
Chivalry will get you somewhere
Rivalry!

You ascertain the plot, my vision's overshot
I have the best confection, I was gone for all the lessons
Who coined these words I use? Stay out and be abused
I didn't want to be the undeniable source of everything

Don't get close
Don't get close
Don't get close
Don't get close
Don't get close (You'd better stay away)
Don't get close (You'd better stay away)
Don't get close (You'd better stay away)
Don't get close (You'd better stay away!)

Waiting, watching all the conflicts
Constrict, just to fit in, squeeze in
I can insist claws and fist
Remember, remember

You take the reverent and never make much sense
I have the worst possession, what I want but so obsessive
Come out and be abused 'cause this is so confused
I only want to be left alone and rot away

Don't get close
Don't get close
Don't get close
Don't get close
Don't get close (You'd better stay away)
Don't get close (You'd better stay away)
Don't get close (You'd better stay away!)
Yeah!
Yeah!

// Scream //

Scream!

Fell forth, destroy the source
Can't see and my voice is hoarse
Tried to wash all your hands off us
But you should know better than to leave us in disgust
Let me take you right to the point
All you ever do is dedicate the disjoint
That does it the time has arrived
Take it or leave it you better not side
You did it again
All you ever did was doubt
What do you want?
Let me tell you what it's all about
One life
Nine hearts
And eighteen hands that'll rip you all apart
We're here to decimate
To show you all we will never fall
It's gonna get serious and critical
Don't stop because the feeling is terminal

Scream!
Scream like you never have before!
Scream!
Scream 'til you can't scream anymore!
Scream!
Scream like your throat is bleeding!
Scream!
Scream 'til your heart stops beating!
Scream for me!

Get off of me and give a lie
Show the whole damn world this will never die
No matter how the energies scatter
Got to know nothing exists but the dream
Give it all 'til there's nothing left to give
Save it all, 'cause it's saving you
If you're going to let the pain inside
Never underestimate the way you live your life

Scream!
Scream like you never have before!
Scream!
Scream 'til you can't scream anymore!
Scream!
Scream like your throat is bleeding!
Scream!
Scream 'til your heart stops beating!
Scream for me!

All our lives!
All we ever sacrificed has paid
Everything!
Everything is possible to me
Why no fate?
Found everything that I had to take away
Save your life!
Save it all and make a better way
All our lives!
All we ever sacrificed has paid
Everything!
Everything is possible to me
Why no fate?
Found everything that I had to take away
Save your life!
Save it all and make a better way

Yeah!

This stress is a feeling that you can't compress!
Everything you're going through is total stress!
Are you going to be a momentary king or just a run around?
Or will you handle the matter and prove you exist?

All our lives!
All we ever sacrificed has paid
Everything!
Everything is possible to me
Why no fate?
Found everything that I had to take away
Save your life!
Save it all and make a better way
All our lives!
All we ever sacrificed has paid
Everything!
Everything is possible to me
Why no fate?
Found everything that I had to take away
Save your life!
Save it all and make a better way

Scream! (Scream!)
Scream! (Scream!)
Scream! (Scream!)
Scream! (Yeah!)

// Vermilion (Terry Date Mix) //

She seems dressed in all the rings of past fatalities
So fragile yet so devious, she continues to see
Climatic hands that press her temples and my chest
Enter the night that she came home, forever
Oh, she's the only one that makes me sad!

She is everything and more, the solemn hypnotic
My Dahlia bathed in possession, she is home to me
I get nervous, perverse, when I see her, it's worse
But the stress is astounding
It's now or never, she's coming home, forever!
Oh, she's the only one that makes me sad!

Hard to say what caught my attention
Vixen crazy, aphid attraction
Carve my name in my face to recognize
Such a pheromone cult to terrorize

I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me

Yeah!

Oh, I'm a slave and I am a master
No restraints and unchecked collectors
I exist through my need to self-oblige
She is something in me that I despise

I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
(I won't let this build up inside of me)
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me

She isn't real
I can't make her real
She isn't real
I can't make her real
She isn't real (She isn't real)
Can't make her real (Can't make her real)
She isn't real (She isn't real)
Can't make her real

I'm not what you think
I'm not what you think
I'm not what you think
I'm not what you think
I'm not what you think
I'm not what you think
I'm not what you think
Or am I?
Or am I what you think?
Or am I what you think?
Or am I what you think?
You could never ever know
You could never ever know

Please keep far away (Far far away)
Keep far away (Far far away)
Far away (Far far away)
Far away (Far far away)
Please keep far away (Far far away)
Keep far away (Far far away)
Far away (Far far away)
Far away (Far far away)

I won't let you walk away
Without hearing what I have to say
I won't let you walk away
Without hearing what I have to say

That place in my mind
That space that you call mine
That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine
That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine
(Got trapped in)
(Got trapped in)
(Got trapped in)
(Got trapped in)

So please just trust in us
Just trust in us
Trust in us

So please just trust in us
Just trust in us
Trust in us

That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine
That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine

Where have I been all this time?
Lost enslaved fatal decline
I've been waiting for this to unfold
But the pieces are only as good as the whole

Severed myself from my whole life
Cut out the only thing that was right
What if I never saw you again?
I'd die right next to you in the end

That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine
That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine

I won't let you walk away
Without hearing what I have to say
Without hearing what I have to say
Without hearing what I have to say
Without hearing what I have to say
Without hearing what I have to say
