// Bone Church //

Burned my hands, wrapped around the sun
Raise my walls, but the damage is done
I see bugs from the corner of my eyes
Just a shadow, a figment, another empty lie

We kill what we love
We love what we kill
Nothing ever changes
Oh, nothing ever will

And my heart is a memory of the pain
I don't need a miracle
Prayers will not save me again

Again
Prayers will not save me again
Prayers will not save me again
Prayers will not save me again

We kill what we love
Oh, we love what we kill

Do no harm, reminders of the flesh
Blinded storms, the ignorance of rush
One man's jewel is another's moistened knife
Another coward, another cripple, another savior in the light

Don't take the place of my sins
Prayers will not save me again
Prayers will not save me again

Salt my wounds, then lick them clean
Cloud of dust, and then I'm gone
Filled within by vindictiveness
A release, I need a release
Searching for an explanation
Way to make you understand
May I feel, my fascination
My need to cut. My need to cut, to carve

Bleeding upon the silken pigtails
Watching the stain spiral down
Force the issue with the klaive
Releasing all the pain I've saved

(Carve) There's something inside
(Carve) There's nothing inside
(Carve) There's something inside
(Carve) Gonna let it out now
(Carve) There's something inside
(Carve) Nothing inside
(Carve) Something inside
(Carve)

Pants so soft, so I get off with that
Sticky, wet bass rap, gonna get your ol' face slapped
Bring more slicing, dicing, and enticing
Gonna slam dunk, you fat ass punk
Stickin' your rat face around the boys hidin' place
(Count to four) Won't bring you any more
Lickin' what I'm stickin' in your face like you're in a race
(Don't slow down) 'Cause I'm comin' up
On your ass, like I wanted to pass
Fist-fuck, (Cock-suck) corn-shuck, (Tough luck)
Sortin' through only part that's left of you
(Your big fat, fuckin' mouth)
Eyes and ears all over the countryside
So there's nowhere for you to run and hide
(Form our attack back at our haven)
No one who thinks your life is worth savin'

(Sit down) Gonna beat you down
(Shut up) Gonna rip you up
(Get out) Show you what pain's about
(Fuck you) Won't give you a reach-around
(Sit down) Gonna beat you down
(Shut up) Gonna rip you up
(Get out) Show you what pain's about
(Fuck you) 'Round

Round

All the pins are out
Nothing is leaking anymore
No less than a thousand times
My brain's been scattered about
Forced to deal with suffering
Make it more than a hobby
Leave my past behind me
Life, life

Show me (Show me) (Show me)
Show me (Show me) (Show me)
Show me (Show me) (Show me)
Show me

Now all the pins are back in
The fluids' resumed just one more time
To keep my face in
Life

You hide it all behind your pain face (Show me your pain face)
You hide it all behind your pain face (Show me your pain face)
You hide it all behind your pain face (Show me your pain face)
You hide it all behind your pain face

Smile while the blade slides down your face
Pain for at least two or three days
You will come to love all your scars
Feel all the blessÃ¨d release
Smile while the blade slides down your face
Pain for at least two or three days
You will come to love your scars
Feel all the blessÃ¨d release
Smile while the blade slides down your face (Smile)
Pain for at least two or three days (Pain)
You will come to love your scars (You)
Feel all the blessÃ¨d release (Feel)

You hide it all behind your pain face (Show me your pain face)
You hide it all behind your pain face (Show me your pain face)
You hide it all behind your pain face (Show me your pain face)
You hide it all behind your pain face

Smile while the blade slides down your face
Smile while the blade slides down your face
Smile while the blade slides down your face
Smile while the blade slides down your face
Smile while the blade slides down your face
Smile while the blade slides down your face
Smile while the blade slides down your face
Smile while the blade slides down face

// My Plague (New Abuse Mix) //

I'm in conniptions for the final act you came here for
The one derivative you manage is the one I abhor
I need a minute to elaborate for everyone the
Everyday abusive things that you have done
Your impossible ego fuck
Is like a megalomaniacal tab on my tongue
And if you touch me, I will rip you apart
I'll reach in and take a bite out of that bitch you call a heart

I know why you blame me
I know why you plague yourself
I know why you blame me
I know why you plague yourself

I'm turning it around like a knife in the shelf
I wanna understand why but I'm hurting myself
I haven't seen a lot of reasons to stop it, I can't just drop it
I'm just a bastard, but at least I admit it, at least I admit it

I know why you blame me
I know why you plague yourself
I know why you blame me
I know why you plague yourself
I know you plague me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself

Yeah!
Yeah!

I know why you blame me
I know why you plague yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you blame yourself
I know you blame me
I know why you plague yourself
I know why you blame me
I know why you plague yourself

Well, I know why you plague yourself!
I know why you plague yourself!
I know why you plague yourself!
I know why you plague yourself!

// Nature //

He can feel them turn
Spools of milky thread
Folding into thought
Seconds tick apart

You molded it, you made it, you caused it, reaction
You licked it, you stole from it, you lied to it, now watch it die
You beat it, you ate from it, you spit on it, retraction
You ignored it, didn't explain to it, you starved it, now watch it die

(Reversal)
Can't take anymore
(Reversal)
Can't take anymore
(Reversal)
Can't take anymore
(Reversal)
Can't take any

Resolved to find a way
To curb his skin addiction
To calcify his mind
To find the ones who made him made him this way

Greasy winged, uh cus-diaper beaking caw fuss
I hear your dung falling, I hear your dung falling down
Affing, I mean laughing
I mean affing at me, eyeing my dowNature
Fat jaws, winter winter present present sniff
Sniff for the fifth time, is no time
Do I come, do I go, do they really seem to know
Gotsta get me some of that creamy filling

(Reversal)
Can't take anymore
(Reversal)
Can't take anymore
(Reversal)
Can't take anymore
(Reversal)
Can't take any

My assembly line of faces are waiting in a row
Stiff, cold, blue complexions that I used to know
Burn abide my yearbook, for there I found no friends
But the ones I knew were shrink-wrapped in the end

(Reversal)
Can't take anymore
(Reversal)
Can't take anymore
(Reversal)
Can't take anymore
(Reversal)
Can't take any

Can't take any
Can't take any
Can't take any
Their feathers are my hair
Can't take anymore
Can't take anymore
Can't take anymore
Can't take any

// Part Of Me //

Once upon a time in the land of necks, where the streets are paved with hillbilly pricks
If you don't look the same, then you are fair game, but the wild inside can never be tamed

And it never will, so I still kill for the thrill
Punk-ass motherfucker dies like that 'cause they never chill
Blood on the ground and remains
Never found, poor fools - never knew what hit em

And so the aforementioned fuckers tried to hit me
In their four by four but they still didn't get me
Jumped through the air with their eight eyes on me, I stared back - then they wouldn't face me

Out of the window, I saw the shotgun
At that moment, they thought that I'd run
But it didn't happen, so the necks were snapping
As my wrath fell down upon them by the ton

Die, fuck, die

Fool

Spine crushed, motherfuckers dead
Snap, crackle, pop drank from their head
Quick turn, search for the three

Disemboweled, made them part of me

Part of

Part of me
You've become part of me
