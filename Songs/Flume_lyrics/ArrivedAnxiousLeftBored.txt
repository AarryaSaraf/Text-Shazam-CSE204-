// SKY SKY 1.3 (2016 Export Wav) //

Sky, sky, sky
Is it only here for some?
Do it and they overcome
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
Shining bright, mm

So what, so what, so why?
It's never what they say it's gon' be
Sky, sky, sky
Would you ever take it from me?

Sky, sky, sky
I'm over what I'm living on
Only thing I'll ever want
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
Shining bright at me
Shining bright past me

So what, so what, so what?
It's never what they say it's gon' be
Sky, sky, sky
Would you ever take it from me?
Oh

From me, from me, from me, oh
From me, from me, from me, mm
Oh, mm, mm, mm

// Chalk 1.3.3 (2017 Export Wav) //

You won't go fooling me twice now, baby
I'm sorry that's the way you're made
I let you get to me once now, baby
But I'll never let you win again

Cover it up, you like to play your own game
Cover it up, you let them know what you're thinking
I bet you never tell them how it feels
I bet you never even try to be real

// All There 1.9 (2019 Export Wav) //

I've gotta take control
'Cause I'm not feeling all there (There)
Minds got a place it can go
Guess I'm not feeling all there (There)

I've gotta take control
'Cause I'm not feeling all there (There)
Minds got a place it can go
Guess I'm not feeling all there (There)

Miss you, miss you
Listen to myâ
Miss you, miss you
Miss you (Oh, ah)
Miss you, miss you
Miss you, miss you (Ah, ah, ah)

Miss you, listen to myâ
Miss you, miss you
Listen to myâ
Miss you, miss you

Miss you, miss you
Miss you, miss you
Miss you, miss you
