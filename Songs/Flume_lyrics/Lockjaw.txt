// Drop The Game //

I've been seeing all, I've been seeing your soul
Give me things that I've wanted to know 
Tell me things that you've done
I've been feeling old, I've been feeling cold
You're the heat that I know
Listen, you are my sun

Oh oh oh oh oh 

Hush, I said there's more to life than rush
Not gonna leave this place with us
Drop the game, it's not enough
Hush, I said there's more to life than rush
Not gonna leave this place with us
Drop the game, it's not enough

I've been seeing all, I've been seeing your soul
Give me things that I've wanted to know
Tell me things that you've done
I've been feeling old, I've been feeling cold 
You're the heat that I know
Listen, you are my sun

Oh oh oh oh oh 

I've been seeing all, I've been seeing your soul
Give me things that I've wanted to know
Tell me things that you've done
I've been feeling old, I've been feeling cold
You're the heat that I know
Listen, you are my sun

Oh oh oh oh oh 

I've been seeing all, I've been seeing your soul
Give me things that I've wanted to know
Tell me things that you've done
I've been feeling old, I've been feeling cold
You're the heat that I know
Listen, you are my sun

Oh oh oh oh oh

// What About Us //

You can run again when it's dark
I don't want to get you now
I can't see you running out
I don't want to get you back

You can run again when it's dark
I don't want to get you now
I can't see you running out
I don't want to get you back

I can see you're running out
(what about us)
I don't want to get you now
It's clear to me you're not here alone
So far over you

I can see you're running out
(what about us)
I don't want to get you now
It's clear to me you're not here alone
So far over you

I can see you're running out
(what about us)
I don't want to get you now
It's clear to me you're not here alone
So far over you

// This Song Is Not About A Girl //

[Chet Faker:]
Cocaine heart is broken, time to retire
Head won't listen to the words I decide on
Meet this, this is from a point of arrival
Preach it from another human devour

Cocaine heart is broken, time to retire
I don't know purple, though tropical
Head won't listen to the words I decide on
I'm a ghost open for bidding poll
Meet this, this is from a point of arrival
Pardon, but knock the show overload
Preach it from another human devour

I don't know purple, though tropical
I'm a ghost open for bidding poll
Pardon, but knock the show overload
Easy, done - something for everyone

Meet this, this is from a point of arrival
Pardon, but knock the show overload
Preach it from another human devour
Easy, done - something for everyone

Cocaine heart is broken, time to retire
I don't know purple, though tropical
Head won't listen to the words I decide on
I'm a ghost open for bidding poll
Meet this, this is from a point of arrival
Pardon, but knock the show overload
Preach it from another human devour

Cocaine heart is broken, it's time to retire
Head spun overlooking, I don't want no fire
