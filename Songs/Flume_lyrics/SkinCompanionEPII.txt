// Enough //

Yeah, King Push
I could tell you what the Porsche cost, what my wrist like
What a brick weigh, what your bitch like
Ace bottles and late models, niggas happy with the base model
Fashion God from Bape model, they follow
I'm the culture, KRS in a roadster
Poetry, Scott La Rock with the coca, I'm the joker
My bitch got the poker face, she a soldier
Might let you fuck just so she can show me the safe
Yugh! I did live through drug wars, open suicide doors
Fuck the bitch on mink floors but it ain't enough
Yugh! Seen the world on these tours, Porsche paying 'til I'm bored
Yugh! I partied off shores but it ain't enough

Motivate or I can be a menace, you got two choices
I got one chopper, I'm hearing voices
I'm seeing visions, these Rolls Royces
In arms reach, I come creep, these snakes are poisonous
Oyster perpetual lifestyle, look at the watch on me right now
Bezel blinding like a bright cloud
It's a drug dealer's dream
Everything that I say is everything that I mean
Let's weigh it up

Check, kilogram on the neck, money, power, respect
Real shooter's on deck, but it ain't enough
Yes, man I just got the text, she's just waiting, undressed
Her girlfriend brought the checks, she ain't enough
Everybody get the tech, all you niggas hit the deck
Bitches think he got next, but it ain't enough
Haters still wanna test, but I just say, "Fuck the rest"
Always gave her my best, but it ain't enough

// Weekend //

Our love, was a weekend on the water
Silly me, for thinking you would want me longer
My love, found a home under the water
Glory be, 'tis the season for a slaughter

Girls will never know what they want, there's no sorrow now
Was it all a mistake, or are you sorry right now
If I had it all my way, I'd be with you right now
Haunted by a memory, yes I'm with you right now

// Fantastic //

Life is wrapped up in plastics, classics
Fucking fantastic
Television show a sitcom classic
Fuzzy screen static

Bad milk got my raisin bran tasting bad
Getting fiber-tastic
Say you'll go, say you're someone imagined
Life's looking tragic

Think Finn is the raddest; Jake, his is passed it
Little yellow bastard
Come get another boyfriend, number ten
What a romantic

Take a bite, it's relaxing, hands crack
Heart is full on acid
Jenny bitching bout her ex again, making me
Melodramatics

Need a hit, need to sit, need to get away
Intergalactic
Warmth fast be escaping me
Left in the attic

Once stoned, I'm down the hole again
It's automatic
Mama says I should get a date, lose weight
Fucking fantastic
