Album: Quits

// Quits //

Whole damn time we was loving undercover yeah
Don't you know that kills me inside
She always gets the best of me I lose my mind
I hate to start fights but I'm about to blow

Fuck that shit
Fuck that shit
I'm calling quits (Calling quits)
She lead me on then leave me lone
Let's call it quits (Call it quits)

I had to get it off the chest
Damn you make a nigga stressed
I hardly gotta flex but when I do I know you feel that
Change my bitch like a season
Cut her off I delete her
All smiles Mona Lisa
She give me too many reasons
How you do me like that
How you turn your back
I'ma pack these bags
I donât want you back

Whole damn time we was loving undercover yeah (We were)
Oh how that killed me inside (It did, it did)
She always gets the best of me I lose my mind
I hate to start fights but I'm about to blow

Fuck that shit
Fuck that shit
I'm calling quits (Calling quits)
She lead me on then leave me lone
Let's call it quits (Call it quits)

You done went and made a mess
Heisman with the step
Tried to catch me slippin'
Had to swerve that shit (Yeah)
Always gave you respect
You ain't give that back
Now she wanna make amends
And I donât want that

Whole damn time we was loving undercover yeah
Oh how that killed me inside
She always gets the best of me I lose my mind
I hate to start fights but I'm about to blow one time

Fuck that shit
Fuck that shit
I'm calling quits (Calling quits)
She lead me on then leave me lone
Let's call it quits (Call it quits)

Ca-callin quits
Ca-callin quits
I'm callin quits
I'm done with this
I'm done with this
Ca-callin quits
Ca-callin quits
I'm callin quits
I'm done with this

// Levitate //

I'm blowin' kisses couple states away
She blow me back and then I elevate
We go a hunnit like a speed race
You know your heart I'd never break
I thought I made that clear don't wanna have you livin' in fear you know I'm in it for the ride
Baby I'm in it for the ride, ride' ride' oh yeah

Ignited the fire it's climbin' we're high now
Excited we dive in she's frightened of flying (Flying)
We ain't planning on coming down

Strap up the only time we play it safe
Used to daydream of takin' you to second base
If they do you wrong I'd set aflame the whole place
I mean the whole place' oh yeah
I thought I made that clear
Imma make all ya worries disappear
Baby I'm in it for the ride
I said I'm in it for the ride, ride, ride' oh yeah

Ignited the fire it's climbin' we're high now
Excited we dive in she's frightened of flying (Flying)
We ain't planning on coming down

// Friends //

Pressure on me
Put that on me, you did
Build up slowly
Explode on ya, I did (I did)

Fed me lies, you're a snake
Yes, I meant that (I did)
Fed me lies yes, you did
You're gonna regret that

Thinking out loud, I'm thinking out loud
All that negativity is bringing me down
You're so toxic, how you live like this?
Don't wanna be friends, I don't wanna be friends
Burnt that bridge, yes you did
Your heart ain't full of love like this
Burnt that bridge, yes you did
Don't wanna be friends, I don't wanna be friends
Oh, no no

Do no talking
Do not call me (Holla)
Hit your heartstrings
Like I'm Rocky (I did)

Fed me lies, you're a snake
Yes, I meant that (I did)
Fed me lies yes, you did
You're gonna regret that

Thinking out loud, I'm thinking out loud
All that negativity is bringing me down
You're so toxic, how you live like this?
Don't wanna be friends, I don't wanna be friends
Burnt that bridge, yes you did
Your heart ain't full of love like this
Burnt that bridge, yes you did
Don't wanna be friends, I don't wanna be friends
Oh, no no

Don't wanna be your friend
(Don't wanna be you friend)
No, I don't want that shit
(No, I don't want that shit)
You're gonna regret that

Thinking out loud, I'm thinking out loud
All that negativity is bringing me down
You're so toxic, how you live like this?
Don't wanna be friends, I don't wanna be friends
Burnt that bridge, yes you did
Your heart ain't full of love like this
Burnt that bridge, yes you did
Don't wanna be friends, I don't wanna be friends
Oh, no no

Thinking out loud, I'm thinking out loud
All that negativity is bringing me down
You're so toxic, how you live like this?
Don't wanna be friends, I don't wanna be friends
