// Counting Sheep (V2) (2018 Export Wav) //

Yeah
Chip shoulder witcha chest out, yeah
Your tall tales are gettin' fleshed out
All that huffin' and puffin' ya breath out
Yeah, lame ass niggas gettin' pressed now (God damn)
Did your Googles, bring your best out
Now you think you could walk in they shoes, do your best now
Yeah, seen that shit on TV, did it when you countin' sheep
But it's all the same thing, right? Yeah

Once upon a while and few lies ago
Some misdemeanor niggas went when the time was gold
They say "Hang dry, hand wash if you can nigga"
"Hang dry, hand wash if you—", come on
Did this and that a few lines ago
But we believed that shit a few lies ago
Was-is-is-is-is-is-as-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is
Catch ya Z's, nigga

Please, nigga
You countin' sheep, nigga
Not even in your dreams, nigga
In the land of revolution, IMAX 3D'd
Niggas think they can act and get handed freebies
Please G, behind the screen is easy
But when the issues get pressed, don't try and sign off treaties
You said "two sheep, three sheep, four sheep, five"
"Black sheep, white sheep, gold sheep, why?"

Nigga, fuck that
No goin' back sheep, we live
Aimed to the tunnel, screamin' let that beat light
And you think it's all games, but they was like knee high
And you doin' all this shit for a reply
You think it's built in the day they six deep by feet, uh
Stack that they leave us, pass three feet high
Plug one, plug two, pause, this can't be right
And take the [?], you ain't get that reply

Yeah, once upon a while and few lies ago
Some misdemeanor niggas went when the time was gold
They say "Hang dry, hand wash if you can nigga"
"Hang dry, hand wash if you—", come on
Did this and that a few lines ago
But we believed that shit a few lies ago
Was-is-is-is-is-is-as-is-is-is-is-is-is-is-is
Catch ya Z's, nigga

// Rhinestone 1.7.2 (2018 Export Wav) //

Why don't I go back to my thing?
This relationship, I'm asking
For your undivided attention
Trust in all that we started

Chex Mix and blue cheese
What you wanna [?]
You are like a rhinestone
Just try to stay alive
[?]
Thought that I should let you know

I'm blushin', I'm still in love (Real love, real love)
More than in love
I'm blushin', is this real love? (Real love, real love)
You're like a flash, and I'm flickin' on, flickin' on
I'm blushin', I'm waitin' up (Real love, real love)
Until you come
I'm blushin', is this real love? (Real love, real love)
You're like a flash, and I'm flickin' on, flickin' on

Pick me up some time in the morning
Still before the sun is dawning
Moonflower, call me your moonflower
Treat me kind, I'll bloom forever

Chex Mix and blue cheese
What you wanna [?]
You are like a rhinestone
Just try to stay alive
[?]
Thought that I should let you know

I'm blushin', I'm still in love (Real love, real love)
More than in love
I'm blushin', is this real love? (Real love, real love)
You're like a flash, and I'm flickin' on, flickin' on
I'm blushin', I'm waitin' up (Real love, real love)
Until you come
I'm blushin', is this real love? (Real love, real love)
You're like a flash, and I'm flickin' on, flickin' on

How's she gonna love me?
How's she gonna leave me?
How's she gonna love me?
How's she gonna love me?
How's she gonna leave me?
How's she gonna love me?
How's she gonna love me?
How's she gonna leave me?
How's she gonna love me?
How's she gonna love me?
How's she gonna leave me?
How's she gonna love me?
(Real love, real love)
(Real love, real love)

// One Step Closer 1.4 (2021 Export Wav) //

If I could take only one step closer
To you
If I could take only one step closer
To you

It's one step closer
It's right there in the center of the screen
Soft touch on the back of the neck
Up in smoke, you can see it so clear now
Out mind when the smoke disappears

If I could take only one step closer
It's one step closer to you
If I could take only one step closer
To you

One step closer

And when it moves the shutter inside you
So close like a shadow of skin
Rubbed up against it, a sound in the distance
Made it banish with the press of a switch

If I could take only one step closer
It's one step closer to you
If I could take only one step closer
To you

It's one step closer to you
It's one step closer
