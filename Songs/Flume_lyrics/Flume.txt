// Sintra //

Left me lying here on the floor
Left me lying here on the floor
Left me, now I'm lying here on the floor
Left me lying here on the floor

Left me lying here on the floor
Left me lying here on the floor
Left me, now I'm lying here on the floor
Left me lying here on the floor

// Holdin On //

To keep on holdin on, holdin on.

// Left Alone //

This is the sound beating of my loves
This is the sound beating of my loves
This is the sound beating of my loves
This is the sound beating of my loves
This is the sound beating of my loves
This is the sound beating of my loves

Good down, Iâm for long
Got my word to be someone
Good down, thatâs alright
All I want is to be left alone
Left alone, left alone, left alone
Left alone, left alone, left alone
Left alone, left alone, left alone
Left alone, 

Cannot swallow blue found vow
More than that my sleep is wild
All I need is suffering bones
Breathe in sorrow
Gonna watch you fake it now
Will I freak can I calm down
And I take it all at a loss
Breathe in sorrow
Gonna watch you fake it now
Will I freak can I calm down
And I take it all at a loss
Breathe out sorrow

Gonna find them peace in loss
Holding by the knees and vow
I can always feel this proud
Breathe out sorrow
Oh I tell you something more
What my brain is bleeding for
And it hurts my darling, but breathe out sorrow
Gonna find them peace in loss
Holding by the knees and vow
I can't always feel this proud
Breathe out sorrow
Oh, I tell you something more
What my brain is bleeding for
And it hurts my darling, but breathe out sorrow

// Sleepless //

My rhymes so unspeakable
My dreams so unreachable
Give it a purpose, cause life itself isn't meaningful
Now that's the truth, I'm speaking for the youth
That's aiming for the top but falling from the roof
Here we, here we go again, with my paper and my pen
Summer 2012 its the year of the end, or is it?
Exquisite lyrics, you hear it or do you fear it
Jammin' in my car, smelling like teen spirit
I see a star falling form the sky, should I catch it
I wanna die in my car, should I wreck it

This drug makes you hooked once, should I test it
Yes no maybe so, now its time for me to grow
Outside of my flow, Do I ever get to know
what my real passion is, why am I so imaginative
Adverb, pronoun, noun, verb, adjective
Mouth running, talking shit, cool it with the laxatives
But its time, to recognize Armageddon's signs
Start lootin' stores, kill whoever, I don't mind
If you see me, don't bro me if you don't know me
That goes to you, you, you and all my homeys

Cause nobody knows me, and nobody told me
How to write poetry, this fucking world owes me
Everything I've ever wanted, fuck you and fuck your life
Fuck you everyday, fuck you every night
Look at all the fucks I give I should start a charity
Bitches thinking they in love, bitches starting to scare me
Only love is family, and my lost dog charlie
If you've seen a white English bull dog call me
All I want out of this world is a changed world
All I want is a metaphysical dream girl

To smoke DMT and weed starting at the universe
Trying to figure out how, nothingness is giving birth
To all of reality, if space had gravity
Would we fall forever or will hit the ground
I wanna step outside the Universe and see whats all around
Cause I don't believe in anything, not even myself
Only way to wake up from the dream is through death
But I keep my sanity, or whatevers left
Cause I gotta keep striving, opposite of thriving
Gotta stay alive and, always keep trying

// On Top //

All that I want in this life is the chance to do my thing
All that I want in this life is the chance to do my thing
Yeah

I want the top
All my people right there at the back of the spot 
I need the top
If you know me y'all now need to stop 
I need the top
All my people there back of the spot, now don't be shy
Yeah

And you don't just wake up rich one day
This kind of life never just slip your way
I gave up taking care free trips to the Bay
Cali banned us 'cause I got a flip in LA

Paris bound 'cause a new video's on the way
No breaks for me, no vaca's for me
I advance admit it before I live it
Watch out, they don't finish

I want the top
All my people right there at the back of the spot 
I need the top
If you know me y'all now need to stop 
I need the top
All my people there back of the spot, now don't be shy
Yeah

Drinks on chill, got drinks on chill
Lights get dim and I think I will
I work so hard that I think I will
Yeah, I had a long week, bitch, how you think I feel?

History favors the bulldog
Roast something, make sure my story gets told
Make sure our story gets told
The night's forever young, it's us that gets old

All that I want in this life is the chance to do my thing
All that I want in this life is the chance to do my thing
Yeah

I want the top
All my people right there at the back of the spot 
I need the top
If you know me y'all now need to stop 
I need the top
All my people there back of the spot, now don't be shy
Yeah

I want the top top top top top 
All my people right there at the back of the spot 
I need the top top top top top 
If you know me y'all now need to stop 
I need the top top top top top 
All my people there back of the spot, now don't be shy
Yeah
Yeah

I want the top top top top top 
All my people right there at the back of the spot 
I need the top top top top top 
If you know me y'all now need to stop 
I need the top top top top top 
All my people there back of the spot, now don't be shy

I want the top top top top top 
All my people right there at the back of the spot 
I need the top top top top top 
If you know me y'all now need to stop 
I need the top top top top top 
All my people there back of the spot, now don't be shy
Yeah
(I feel what you got for me world)
Yeah
What you got got got got

// Stay Close //

You told
You told me to, me to stay
To stay, to stay, to stay, to stay
To stay, to stay, to stay
To stay, to stay, to stay, to...
To stay, to stay, to stay
[x4]

// Insane //

You don't have to be afraid
You don't even have to be brave
Living in a gilded cage

The only risk is that you'll go
Go, Go
Insane
Go, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh, go, go, insane
Go, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Go
Go insane
And go
Go insane
And go
Go insane
And go, go, go, go insane
And go

Your mind is on track
For games we play these days
With every path we take
You know you're safe, safe, safe
The only risk is that you'll go insane
The only risk is that you'll go insane

And go
Go insane
And go, go, go
Go insane
And go
Go insane
And go, go, go
Go insane
Go insane
Go insane
Go insane
And go, go, go
Go insane

// Bring You Down //

Hush now
You're standing on a landmine
Tread lightly
Get ready to explode

Hush now
Those eyes can not harm you
Keep your wits about
Don't let it bring you down

Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down

Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
How can we disguise
This awful truth

I've seen it all before
Your eyes are wet
Your head is on the floor
And it's only a matter of time
Before you hit the ground running
Running running
Running running

Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down

Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
How can we disguise
This awful truth

Hush now
You're standing on a landmine
Tread lightly
Get ready to explode

Hush now
Your eyes can not harm you
Keep your wits about
Don't let it bring you down

And never let go
And I'm afraid of being too wrong
And I'm afraid of being too wrong in this side, oh

Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
Let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down

Don't let it bring you down
Don't let it bring you down
How can we disguise
This awful truth
