// Never Be Like You //

What I would do to take away
This fear of being loved, allegiance to the pain
Now I'm fucked up and I'm missing you
He'll never be like you
I would give anything to change
This fickle-minded heart that loves fake shiny things
Now I'm fucked up and I'm missing you
He'll never be like you

I'm only human, can't you see? I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face, tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it, ooh, he'll never be like you
I'm only human, can't you see? I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face, tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it, ooh, he'll never be like you

How do I make you wanna stay?
Hate sleeping on my own, missing the way you taste
Now I'm fucked up and I'm missing you
He'll never be like you
Stop looking at me with those eyes
Like I could disappear and you wouldn't care why
Now I'm fucked up and I'm missing you
He'll never be like you

I'm only human, can't you see? I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face, tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it, ooh, he'll never be like you
I'm only human, can't you see? I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face, tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it, ooh, he'll never be like you

I'm falling on my knees, forgive me, I'm a fucking fool
I'm begging, darling, please, absolve me of my sins, won't you?
I'm falling on my knees, forgive me, I'm a fucking fool
I'm begging, darling, please, absolve me of my sins, won't you?

I'm only human, can't you see? I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face, tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it, ooh, he'll never be like you
I'm only human, can't you see? I made, I made a mistake
Please just look me in my face, tell me everything's okay
'Cause I got it, ooh, he'll never be like you

Baby, baby, please believe me
C'mon, take it easy
Please don't ever leave me, ooh
He'll never be like you

// Lose It //

Put away your inhibitions
Let the beast in you just get loose
We all young, wild and different
We could all get lit from a lil goose
I know youâre terrified by what the future lies
But thereâs no compromising, itâs my way or the highway
We all just played the lust, hard building breaking trust
She gonâ get wowed when we come out
Like she gonâ get loud when the weed come out this instant
Give a fuck what your friends think
Tell their boosie ass go wait in line
With them lame niggas talking real rap
Tell âem break your neck go and bust a rhyme

Blow one down, pass it around, aye
Fuck with me now, weâre running wild, aye
Nobody game, we own the town, aye
Never come down, Iâll never come down

Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it

Everybody got guilty pleasures
Mine just turned to catch me cases
Handcuffs, police inspections
Lawyers, judges, allegations
Turn on your favorite station
You hear the same old song
I feel like Nagasaki, dog
Iâm âbout to drop the bomb

Blow one down, pass it around, aye
Fuck with me now, weâre running wild, aye
Nobody game, we own the town, aye
Never come down, Iâll never come down

Blow one down, pass it around, aye
Fuck with me now, weâre running wild, aye
Nobody game, we own the town, aye
Never come down, Iâll never come down

Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it

Lose it, lose it, lose it
I might
Lose it, lose it, lose it

// Numb & Getting Colder //

Make your decisions now
Weigh it up
Facing a long road down or
Keeping your head above
Saying the same thing twice, won't make it right
Head up in your desires, but

Maybe you're looking for different way
'Cause I know when you act like this
That you got into something
Let it take control of you, oh
'Cause you say it, but you won't admit it
You're numb and getting colder, physical existence
Disappears

Said you begged to leave
I won't be behind you
And I can't breathe, breathe
I won't be behind you
Said you begged to leave
I won't be behind you
And I can't breathe, breathe
I won't be behind you

Not gonna tell you stop, ease it up
Hold your emotions back, stop taking it out on her
I'm gonna lose no pride, giving up
We're going on lockdown

But maybe you're looking for a different way
'Cause I know when you act like this
That you got into something
Let it take control of you, oh
'Cause you say it, but you won't admit it
You're numb and getting colder, physical existence
Disappears

Said you begged to leave
I won't be behind you
And I can't breathe, breathe
I won't be behind you
Said you begged to leave
I won't be behind you
And I can't breathe, breathe
I won't be behind you

If I feel like losing my mind
We're in too deep
But feelings often we leave behind
I'm too weak from this
Slow down, take a second, refine
And trust your instincts
Broken down to one thing, survive
So primitively

Said you begged to leave
I won't be behind you
And I can't breathe, breathe
I won't be behind you
Said you begged to leave
I won't be behind you
And I can't breathe, breathe
I won't be behind you

// Say It //

[Verse 1: Tove Lo]
Feeling the song, party done
Shadows walking home
Walking with our game on
You are my kind, classic mind
And you look so fine
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Loving the cold, smoke a roll
See your fingers shake
I'm getting through your heart break
Some kinda freak, sing for me
Don't know what I need
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

[Pre-Chorus: Tove Lo]
Don't doubt me babe
You make me wanna change
Break my bed to make me wanna stay
I can't...
Bite me babe
You make me love the pain
Break my bed to make me wanna stay
I can't...

[Chorus: Tove Lo]
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Got me falling right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me fuck you right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 2: Tove Lo]
I'm getting the door, silent walk
Whose the first to speak?
Speak it like a real freak
Voice in my head, in my bed
Filled with you instead
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Taking your time, work my mind
And I play with you
I play pretend it's so true
Follow me down
Listen 'round to the deep dark sound
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

[Pre-Chorus: Tove Lo]
Don't doubt me babe
You make me wanna change
Break my bed to make me wanna stay
I can't...
Bite me babe
You make me love the pain
Break my bed to make me wanna stay
I can't...

[Chorus: Tove Lo]
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Got me falling right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me fuck you right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

[Bridge: Instrumental]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Tove Lo]
Don't doubt me babe
You make me wanna change
Break my bed to make me wanna stay
I can't...
Bite me babe
You make me love the pain
Break my bed to make me wanna stay
I can't...

[Chorus: Tove Lo]
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Got me falling right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
When you say it like that
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let me fuck you right back
Oh, oh, oh, oh

// Smoke & Retribution //

[Vince Staples:]
You ain't got no money, I ain't got no time
All these faces lookin' funny when I'm drivin' by
Had to tint my whip, my name is buzzin'
Know they plan on killin' mine
Aimin' at your temple, we was taught to kill a nigga mind
Genocide buried in the tide, cleanse it in the sand
Blood is sittin' in my hands, I'll never be the bigger man
I know they'll never understand, but I don't give a fuck
Lift your hands up high before I stick you up

[KuÄka:]
I held you to the ground cause you were floating
Told me you're afraid of disappointing
Pushing on your physical existence
Pushing only cause you felt resistance
Can't help but think about the situation
Tryna get to see but my mind's racing
Only got each other we can turn to
Lying here, I know they'll never break you free

[Vince Staples:]
You and me nobody else
If it can't be that way then I'll just be all by myself
I love the way you stay away from me, you make me melt
Those nights you used to come and stay with me
Replaying in my memory, it's no such thing as meant to be
That's fine cause you so fine, the way you walk, you talk
The way you leave your mark, just can't break you from my thoughts
Walkin' through Ramona Park like they wasn't tryna shoot me up
Doing all we did, we still ain't do enough

[KuÄka:]
Leaving through the night and starting fires
Going through society's desires
Smoke and retribution, keep it burning
Only cause of sorrow I'll be learning
Can't help but think about the situation
Tryna get to see but my mind's racing
Only got each other we can turn to
Lying here, I know they'll never break you free

[Vince Staples:]
Nah, I ain't scared of six feet
Cause I ain't scared to be free
All I seen while on this earth
Know that hearse can't be too worse
Tell the woman that I hurt
That I apologize for all my lies
And tell my mama blame my karma
Hate she had to see me die
I just wanna see the sky
Shinin' from the other side
Lookin' down on all my friends
Makin' sure they're walkin' right
Cause ain't nobody watch our back
And this life way too hard for that
I made it out with my heart intact
Might harm me, still can't harvest that

// You Know //

Sometimes it feels like
The world spin opposite of the way you spin
Sometimes you just gotta create your own
A world

[Allan Kingdom:]
I been on a mission, man
I been on a mission lately
Some sticky situations I just grinder down to make it
Iâve never been to prison, man
Still donât know what it is to break free, no, no
Now I live my vision plan, no need to hallucinate
The nigga be slipping, man, I think they gonâ make me angry
If they wouldâve listened I couldâa kept my cool today
Evil got me tripping, man, I donât think that you can say, no, no
Youâre in my position, man, you just couldnât hit the brakes

[Raekwon:]
I canât believe it
Word on the streetâs one of my soldiers talking to them alphabet boys
My first reaction is to find out who, where and why
Put the word out and bring âem to me now, but keep âem alive
Put some bread on his head and make sure heâll rot
Cause this is something I ainât tolerating
Plus Iâm getting impatient
Iâm fainting oâ breaking for real, but Iâm salivating
My phone rung itâs at the seven oâclock sharp
They said they had âem in one oâ my warehouses by the dock
Jumped in the Benz with a ill look, no grin
With a still hook, Iâma âbout to do this coward in
When I got there DD was already tied up
Pillow case on his head and the blood stains dried up
The moment I been waiting for is finally here
I get to see who done betrayed me
Snatched the pillow case off this wigger
Hold him here and now he's tryna' face me
Who I see, my little niece boyfriend I seen
He begging me not to kill him
I told âem I got him
As I poured the gasoline, I thought about my little niece
I know she love him, but he a snail
He tryna push love in jail
Take me from my wife and kids
Why should I spare this maggot life and limb
Man, it is what it is
He chose to play this game
I lit the match and watched his friend go up in flames

[Allan Kingdom:]
Get emotion
We in motion
Make commotion
I can feel
How we roll on
Keep it going
Let it go out
Take the wheel
Saw up in your eyes
I'm amazed, I know
Saw up in your eyes
To the things I know
We rode it for life
Put the game on me
If we don't get it right
Put the blame on me

Guess again
Thought that you could pull the word over a veteran
I would pull the trigger but I'm thinking that it's better I, better I
Burn you like a cinder, let me share the light, share the light
(Yeah)
Gasoline
Pour it in my tank
Now it's absorbing in your skin
Man, this fool is dimmer and I wish she had a better mind, better mind
Where you talking now you were regretting mind, get it right
I been cutting loose ends
Why your lips so loose talking
I could fuck with new friends too
Gotta get it with my new
I could be a nuisance
But not if you use caution
[?]
Itâs time we write some new commandments

// Take A Chance //

So you feel all your powers unfold
Stretching your big wings over waters turning gold
So tell your story, baby, donât give up
Just let all it go out, the quiet wishingâs not loud enough

Will you be the one to take a chance?
Have demands, spill your heart
Will you be the one to take a stand
Make the girls dance
Spill your thoughts
Will you be the one to take a chance?
Have demands, spill your heart
Will you be the one to take a stand
Make the girls dance
Spill your thoughts, will you?

You could break up clouds with your fist in the air
We're singing out loud as we march up the square
He always goes to put you in your place
And now you're chanting out loud so you can't be erased

Will you be the one to take a chance?
Have demands, spill your heart
Will you be the one to take a stand
Make the girls dance
Spill your thoughts
Will you be the one to take a chance?
Have demands, spill your heart
Will you be the one to take a stand
Make the girls dance
Spill your thoughts, will you?

Will you be the one to take a chance?
Have demands, spill your heart
Will you be the one to take a stand
Make the girls dance
Spill your thoughts
Will you be the one to take a chance?
Have demands, spill your heart
Will you be the one to take a stand
Make the girls dance
Spill your thoughts, will you?

// Innocence //

When you hold me
All your innocence, something broken
All your innocence when you hold me
You hold me
All your innocence, something broken
Broken
All your innocence when you hold me
You hold me
All your innocence, something broken
Broken
All your innocence when you hold me
You hold me
All your innocence, something broken
Broken
All your innocence...

(Yes, yes, yes, don't stop, stop, stop...)
When you hold me
All your innocence, something broken
Broken
All your innocence when you hold me
(Yes, yes, yes, yes....)
All your innocence, something broken
All your innocence....
(Yes, yes, yes, yes....)

Begin again, begin again
How do we begin again?
Start again, start again
How do we make it all a game?
Begin again, begin again
How do we begin again?
Start again, start again
How do we make it all a game?

How do we erase
And how do we evade
(Something broken, broken)
(All your innocence)
How do we erase
And how do we evade
(Something broken, broken)
(All your innocence)

All we want is a chance to give ourselves
Our way, our way
(All your innocence)
All we want is a chance to give ourselves
Our way, our way
(All your innocence)

// Like Water //

Melt into me
We go like water
We go like water

Bleed, we all bleed
We go like water
We go like water

Gift everything
We go like water
We go like water

All night
Close my eyes
Canât sleep
Cry tonight
Give me life
Rain down on me
All I need, all I need
Youâre all I need, all I need
Youâre all I need, youâre all I need

All I need, all I need
All I need, all I need
Youâre all I need, all I need
Youâre all I need, youâre all I need

// Tiny Cities //

[Beck:]
Can I, should I find my way home?
Now did I think I better go home?
All I said I needed was gone
But I thought I heard it all wrong

Now can it ever be a safe place?
When they never seem to forget
So admit it. More than you said
Grill it down inside of your head

Oh, she is following me in my head when I am all alone
Thinking of her every time I want to try to let her go
But it's never easy when you think you have it in control
Somehow you get caught up in the moment and you never know
All these tiny cities that you're holding in your little hand
In the wind like diamond lights, they'll blow away in desert sand
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last

It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last
It was never perfect, it was never meant to last

Why can't I fall down into the ground 
Gotta get it back, back
Why can't I fall down into the ground 
Gotta get it back, back

Can I ever get ahead of what I want and what I need?
And what'd I have to do to get away from what is killing me?
How can I convince myself to not believe in what I know?
When all I see is dominoes falling uphill as we go
