// Change (Remix) //

Everybody, everybody...

You left for work 
but I'm still thinking bout your touch. 
I see that, I kiss that, I flip that. 
Why'd you have to go? 
Your skin just like gasses in that roll up video. 
I see that, I want that. 
If you feel me let me know.

If you and me can be for real. 
Your touch, I need your love again,
and again, and again, and again...

Baby girl how your kisses so sweet? 
Let them want what they want, 
don't mean a thing to me 
cause everybody envies your touch. 

We're walking and your holding my hand. 
Yeah, that right there, 
now I can understand why everybody envies your touch.

Everybody, everybody...

Baby girl how your kisses so sweet? 
Let them want what they want, 
don't mean a thing to me 
cause everybody envies your touch. 

We're walking and you're holding my hand. 
Yeah, that right there, 
now I can understand why everybody envies your touch.

Everybody, everybody...

// Hyperreal //

[KUÄKA:]
We pulled into the back road
Shimmering this way forth
Wearing out its course end, I could only dream about
What is hidden, heard through its white noise

All seems too clear
Let it wash over me
Don't disappear
Visions are hyperreal

All seems too clear
Let it wash over me
Don't deserve it
Visions are hyperreal

Rising from the vapour misted patterns, voices left behind
From the vapour misted patterns, can we stay a while?
Guess I'm sick of things being the same
Doesn't have to be every day, never change
Just recycling things I thought were true when I was younger
But I'm older now, I should've listened, oh
The splinters left me blind, I had to change my mind

But constantly, it all seems too clear
Let it wash over me
Don't disappear
Visions are hyperreal

Let it wash over me
Don't deserve it
Visions are hyperreal

Voices left behind
Rising from the vapour mist
Can we stay a while?
Voices left behind

// Let You Know //

You wanna let me know now that you've let me go
Life is better still and I guess somehow
You'll just keep on coming back
I wanna let you know now that you've let me go
Life is better still and I guess somehow
Everyone says you're coming back

But I'll let you know that you fill me whole
So now you try to call me home
Let me know what you're thinking of
And now these words are all air

You wanna let me know now that you've let me go
Life is better still and I guess somehow
You'll just keep on coming back

But I'll let you know that you fill me whole
So now you try to call me home
Let me know just what you're thinking of
And now these words are all air
Boy let me know what you're thinking of
So now that you try to call me home
Let me know just what you're thinking of
And now these words are all air

You won't see what everyone can
Did I make you feel like less of a man?
I heard you drive past my house again
Over again, over again
But I'll let you know that you fill me whole
So now you try to call me home
Let me know just what you're thinking of
And now these words are all air

But I'll let you know that you fill me whole
So now you try to call me home
Let me know just what you're thinking of
And now these words are all air
And now these words are all air

// My Boo //

[KuÄka, Vera Blue & Ngaiire:]
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on, give me a call boo
If your love is strong, gonna give my all to you

[Vince Staples:]
Wake up in the morning
Yawning near you, on my mind
Would you mind movin' closer?
Let me look into your eyes
It's a sight for the ages
Got me anxious, so punch drunk right now
Loss and lovely, spun right 'round
I can't wait 'til the sun goes down

[KuÄka, Vera Blue & Ngaiire:]
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on, give me a call boo
If your love is strong, gonna give my all to you
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on, give me a call boo
If your love is strong, gonna give my all to you

I need you
To have you, hold you, squeeze you
So I'm going out every weekend
Just to see my boo again

[Vince Staples:]
If I care, hold your hand and walk you to the promised land
Would you take the trip or would you switch and flip the script?
No, this road ain't rowdy cobblestone
That big old house will make a home
All the money in the world, but you'll still die alone
I can't right my wrongs, so I just write my songs
Won't you dance with me to help escape my misery?
My two left feet are patient
Where you left me, I'm waiting
Send me your directions for my final destination

[KuÄka, Vera Blue & Ngaiire:]
These feelings I have for you
Can go deeper if you can come
Correct with your game, boy
No, no, no, you can't be late, boy

At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on, give me a call boo
If your love is strong, gonna give my all to you
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady, maybe
If your game is on, give me a call boo
If your love is strong, gonna give my all to you

I need you
To have you, hold you, squeeze you
So I'm going out every weekend
Just to see my boo again

// Rushing Back //

I always let the days slip away, I should have been making up my mind
I never opened up, took it all in and now I'm running out of time
Sometimes I dream about going back, keeping all the things I left behind
But now I know you can't change the past, way too young to know the reason why

And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back

I feel the gravity pulling me faster than it ever has before
When I was seventeen, nicotine loving had me rushing out the door
I try to hold it back, take a breath, looking at old pictures on the floor
But I hear everything telling me you don't have the time, you gotta go

And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back

All the years, all the issues
All the eyes I have looked into
The stages and the love
All comes rushing back at once

I always let the days slip away, I should have been making up my mind
I never opened up, took it all in and now I'm running out of time
Sometimes I dream about going back, keeping all the things I left behind
But now I know you can't change the past, way too young to know the reason why

And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back

I always
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
I always
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back

// Shooting Stars (triple j Like A Version) //

Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh

It's late and I'm awake, starin' at the wall
Open up my window, head floats out the door
No one else around, the shimmer takes my eye
I lift my head, blinded by the sky
Feel my weight in front, followin' the sound
Moves away so fast, fall down to the ground
I know there's more to come, jump back to my feet
Now I only see ahead of me, chasin' down the street
(Down the street, down the street, down the street, down the street)

Gave my love to a shootin' star
But she moves so fast that I can't keep up, I'm chasin'
I'm in love with a shootin' star
But she moves so fast, when she falls, then I'll be waitin'
Gave my love to a shootin' star
But she moves so fast that I can't keep up, I'm chasin'
I'm in love with a shootin' star
But she moves so fast, when she falls, then I'll be waitin'

// Some Minds //

In our home all day I waited for the change
Something warm that I could say
But I admit it won't come
Somehow I don't care
Though I love the clothes she wears
And I love her body bare (bare)

So, I pray, I pray that it won't feel the same, and
Don't think that I can't see it in your eyes
Darling yeah, we both knew it from the start
Some minds are better kept apart

Here I pass the day in a most peculiar way
Watching ships out in the bay
And I swallow so hard
Am I too weak to fight?
As the day becomes the night
And I don't want to be right (right)

So, I pray, I pray that it won't feel the same, and
Don't think that I can't see it in your eyes
Darling yeah, we both knew it from the start
Some minds are better kept apart

I pray that it won't feel the same, and
Don't think that I can't see it in your eyes
Darling yeah, we both knew it from the start
Some minds are better kept apart

// The Difference //

The difference in between
All the faces you read
When the grass ain't green
When you fix everything

I don't know about you
But I got to get it out
And I don't know how soon
But if we die
I want to bring the whole thing

Who cares about a game
When it's all been replaced
Each level feels the same
It really goes either way

I don't know about you
But I got to get it out
And I don't know how soon
But if we die
I want to bring the whole thing

Just another world that I gotta get a grip of and hold onto
Just another world that I gotta get a grip of and hold on
Just another world that I gotta get a grip of and hold onto
Just another world that I gotta get a grip of and hold onto
