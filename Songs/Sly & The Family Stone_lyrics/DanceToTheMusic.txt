// I Ain't Got Nobody (For Real) //

I ain't got nobody
Lookin' out for me
I ain't got nobody
I am afraid

Look around from time to time
If you see me lookin' don't pay me no mind
Let me tell you what I'm tryin to find
A girl who's for real all the time
She don't have to wear a wig
She don't have to be too big
In any given community as long as she loves me

I ain't got nobody
I ain't got nobody
I ain't got nobody
I ain't got nobody

For real
For real
For real

I ain't got nobody
Lookin' out for me
I ain't got nobody
Anybody can see

All I want is a downhome girl
I'll find her if she's in this world
For real is all she has to be
Reality is all she has to see
Love is all she has to give
Life is all she has to live
If I could have all of this
I'd let her have my every kiss

I ain't got nobody
I ain't got nobody
I ain't got nobody
I ain't got nobody

For real

I ain't got nobody
Lookin' out for me
I ain't got, ain't got nobody
I am afraid

Look around from time to time
If you see me lookin' don't pay me no mind
Let me tell you what I'm tryin to find
A girl who's for real all the time
She don't have to wear a wig
She don't have to be too big
In any given community as long as she loves me

I ain't got nobody
I ain't got nobody
I ain't got nobody
I ain't got nobody

// Are You Ready //

Are you ready (are you ready)?
Are you ready (are you ready)?

Don't hate the black
Don't hate the white
If you get bit
Just hate the bite
Make sure your heart is beatin' right

How's your backbone
How's your eye?
Add some bottom on mighty tight

Groovy people how do you do?
Let me dedicate my fuzz to you

Are you ready (are you ready)?
Are you ready (are you ready)?

Are you ready (are you ready)?
Are you ready (are you ready)?

// Don't Burn Baby //

I can understand frustration
Joined by agitation
Creates aggravation
Led by a congregation

But don't burn baby, burn
You just learn, baby, learn
Don't burn baby, burn
You just learn, baby

I can understand confusion
Creates bad illusion
Sometime the wrong one losin'
Everybody abusin'

But don't burn baby, burn
You just learn, baby, learn
Don't burn baby, burn
You just learn, baby, baby

Don't burn, baby, burn
You got to learn, baby, learn
So that you can earn, baby, earn
Get a little something called yearn, baby, yearn

You'd be sittin' around like the underdog
One of these days
Talkin about dearn, baby, dearn
So get yourself together and get together

I want to see you churn, baby, churn
I want to see you churn, baby, churn
I want to see you churn, baby, churn
Hey, hey

Everybody station to station
Help your part of the nation
Understand the proclamation
Retake the emancipation

But don't burn baby, burn
You just learn, baby, learn
Don't burn baby, burn
You just learn, baby, baby
