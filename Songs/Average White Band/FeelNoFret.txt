// When Will You Be Mine //

It's not what you do, it's just the way that you do it
Makes me feel this way
It's not what I see, it's what I read in to looks been giving me
Now make no mistakes (make no mistakes) I'm not sure
I can take anymore of this waiting game
If I had my way
(If I had my way) I'd like to hear you say
You kinda feel the same way to
So
When will you be mine, do I have to wait forever
When will you be mine do I have to wait forever, ever, ever
When will you be mine, when will you be mine, when will you be mine
It's not what you think, but when you take a drink
I feel this invitation
There's no need to worry, 'cause I'm in no hurry
I just want "that sensation"
I don't look for trouble (don't look for trouble)
Sometimes that trouble, come looking for me, yeah

There's one thing that I want to do
Is take you out of here with me
So
When will you be mine, do I have to wait forever
When will you be mine, do I have to wait forever
When will you be mine
When will you be mine
When will you be mine, do I have to wait forever
When will you be mine, do I have to wait forever
When will you be mine, what's the problem I've got to know
When will you be mine, please don't keep me in suspense this way
When will you be mine, this waiting is killing me
When will you be mine, I can't stand your drinking all night

// Please Don't Fall In Love //

Please don't fall in love
Leave the words unspoken
'Cause if you do you know
Your heart will get broken

Love is a plain and simple
Game for fools
What makes you think
You can change all the rules
But my advice to you
Is to look around
Don't even think twice about
This loving thing you've found

You talk about love as if
It's a matter of fact
Love deals the kind of hand
That's bound to bite you back
If you feel sure enough
Then that's all right
But when the doubt creeps in
You've got to let it slide

Please don't fall in love
Leave the words unspoken
'Cause if you do you know
Your heart will get broken
Please don't fall in love
Unless you're truly certain
'Cause if you do you know
You're gonna be hurting

// Walk On By //

If you see me walking
Down the street
And I start to cry
Each time we meet
Walk on by, walk on by
Make believe that
You don't see the tears I
Just let me grieve in private
'Cause each time I see you
I break down and cry

Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by

I just can't get over losing you
And so if I seem broken and blue
Walk on by, walk on by
Foolish pride
That's all that I have left
So let me hide the tears and
The sadness you gave me
When you said good-bye

Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by

// Feel No Fret //

My friend, my good friend
Don't you look so sad
I know that you've been cheated
That's bad, so bad
But time is too precious
Why don't you put on that smile
Forget about loneliness
If you occupy your time
Then pretty soon you'll

Feel no fret
Be no weeping no wailing
Feel no fret
Be no meaning no groaning
Feel no fret
Nothing new that you're owning

My friend, my good friend
Dry your weeping eyes
Handle it with courage
If you hold your head up high
Then pretty soon you'll

Feel no fret
Be no weeping no wailing
Feel no fret
Be no moaning no groaning
Feel no fret
Nothing new that you're owning
Feel no fret

My friend, my good friend
It's an all time low
But you can see right through it
If you hang in tight
Then pretty soon you'll

Feel no fret
Be no weeping and wailing
Feel no fret
Be no moaning no groaning
Feel no fret
Nothing new that you're owning
Feel no fret

// Stop The Rain //

Just yesterday you slipped
Away from me
Without so much
As one word of good-bye
You packed the sunshine
In your big old suitcase
Now only the rain fills the sky

You were mine
But suddenly it's changed
Wish that I... could find a way
To stop the rain

I thought that everything
Was going fine
But I was blind
Blind as a man could be
I took for granted
What you tried hard to give
And now the rain
Is all I can see

You were mine
But that was yesterday
Wish that I... could find a way
To stop the rain

Now tell me please
Do you understand
What this feeling
Is all about
'Cause when you left me
You took my heart
Squeezed the sunshine out

But in time
This heart of mine will heal
The Sun will shine
And I can find a way to stop the rain

// Atlantic Avenue //

Here I am, strolling down Atlantic Avenue
With the sunlight in my eyes
Here I am, and there's nothing I would rather do
When I want some peace of mind
I leave the smoke of Rio behind, as the evening starts to fly
I want to feel the ocean breeze, where the mountains kiss the sky

So come on, down Atlantic Avenue
Let the samba take a hold of you
'Cause I know there is no place like the Avenue
When the music gets a hold of you

Dive along to Ipanema there's always time to spare
Forget the troubles of the world, when they get to much to bear
Won't you please come on Atlantic Avenue

Flying down to Rio
Never thought I would be, walking by the ocean
Here today, no
Pretty soon I've got to leave, but I know my heart will stay, ooh
Atlantic Avenue

Here I am strolling down Atlantic Avenue
Here I am, and there's nothing I would rather do
When I want some peace of mind
So come on, down Atlantic Avenue
Let the samba take a hold of you

Here I am strolling down Atlantic Avenue
Here I am, and there's nothing I would rather do
When I want some peace of mind
So come on, down Atlantic Avenue
Let the samba take a hold of you

// Ace Of Hearts //

Just to be with you now
Is one thing I can't imagine
'Cause the part you play today
Is the one that was missing
And from where I stand right now
I can see, so clearly
That with every passing day
I want more of this magic

You're the ace of hearts
Number one in everything
That comes to mind
I think about it all the time
How you won my heart, easy
Easy was the game you played
Easy 'cause you had it made

So you see what you have done

And there's no way to undo it
I have only just begun
To understand it
Now on thing is clear to me
There is love and there is real love
And the only way to know
Is feel what I'm feeling

You're the ace of hearts
Number one in everything
That comes to mind
I think about it all the time
How you won my heart, easy
Easy was the game you played
Easy 'cause you had it made

// Too Late To Cry //

It's too late to cry
Too late for wondering why
You got to dry your eyes
Baby, it's too late to cry

You always told me
It was no good, no good
I never treated you the way
That I ought to do
I was an easy target
Too blind to see my weakness
I did you wrong, I know
But you couldn't really see my side
I know you didn't understand

Now it's too late to cry
Too late for wondering why
You got to dry your eyes
Baby, it's too late to cry

We had those good times
Some that were so bad, so bad
We couldn't hold what we had
At the start
It's too late to cry
The feeling is gone now, gone now
Gets so bad sometimes
It's hard to stop from breaking down
And you wonder if you really tried

Now it's too late to cry
Too late for wondering why
Yes it's too late to cry
Wondering just what passed you by
Baby, it's too late to cry
Gotta dry your eyes

// Fire Burning //

Keep the fire burning
Till I get back home to you
I'll keep the wheels turning...

When I'm away from you, baby
I'm running on half my speed
So I've got to know
At the end of the line
You will be waiting for me

Keep the fire burning
Till I get back home to you
I'll keep the wheels turning...

When I'm away from you
The road may be long and tough
But what I want you to do
I guess you know it too
Is keep the flame hot enough

Keep the fire burning
Till I get back home to you
I'll keep the wheels turning...
