// You're My Number One //

When it gets up the sunshine, is that what I'm about to go
So if I tried to get my love to someone else
I know it's love I'd be without
And love like us won't come around every day
And I need you all the way

Oh, you're my number one
You're my number one and only love
Oh, you're my number one
You're my number one and only love

I admit that I am in love yeah
Confused that I have place to go
No need to tell you I've been cheated in my mind
It's written on our face yeah

But now I know our love is real
Understand it
I don't want nobody else

Oh, you're my number one
You're my number one and only love
Oh, you're my number one
You're my number one and only love

Ooh, ooh

You're my number one (you understand)
Number one (ooh, ooh)
I don't want nobody else
You're my number one (you understand)
Number one
You better believe it, yeah
I don't want anybody else

You're my number one
You're my number one and only love (my love)
Oh
You're my number one
You're my number one and only love

Oh (oh)
You're my number one (you're my number one)
You're my number one and only love (number one and only love)
You better believe it
Oh (ooh)
You're my number one
You're my number one and only love

Oh
You're my number one
You're my number one and only love

// Easier Said Than Done //

Honey don't act that way
I think you better look before you leave
I'm not trying to make you stay
But the water may be too deep

Remember I walked after a fight
It was hard to get along, the feeling got to strong
But it was harder to stay away
When I toss and turn all night and I think of you all day

I stay out every night to find another
But it's easier said than done
Trying hard to find another to match up to my lover
But it's easier said than done
Trying hard to find another to match up to my lover
But it's easier said than done
To stay away

Maybe it's your turn
You think the flame in your heart has burnt out
But there's a lesson to be learned
You better stay out than put oneself down

Forgive me for what I said
I came down on you like a wave in the ocean
I'm back to you once more
And I wanna give to you all my love and devotion

I stay out every night to find another
But it's easier said than done
Trying hard to find another to match up to my lover
But it's easier said than done

If you still wanna go
Then I said all that I can say
But there's one thing you should know
When you're alone you see things in a different way

Life is much too lonely you need your one and only
But it's easier said than done
Trying hard to find another to match up to my lover
But it's easier said than done

Life is much too lonely you need your one and only
But it's easier said than done (Easier said than done)
Trying hard to find another to match up to my lover
But it's easier said than done (Easier)

Life is much too lonely you need your one and only
But it's easier said than done

// You Wanna Belong //

You wanna belong
To someone who will love you
Like you want them to
You wanna belong
There's no one who will love you
Quite the way I do

Sometimes you see me coming
And you go the other way
Running from a love you know that you need
But I'll keep right on coming, day after day
To capture your attention and finally make you see

You wanna belong
To someone who will love you
Like you want them to
You wanna belong
There's no one who will love you
Quite the way I do
You wanna belong

Know that I
Have slaved through times and hills
When you touched the bound
But you passed me by
But I'm the one who cares enough to stay around, oh
You're always hesitating like you can't make up your mind
But you're the one who's waiting
And surely you would find

You wanna belong
To someone who will love you
Like you want them to (oh-oh)
You wanna belong
And there's no one who will love you
Quite the way I do
Come on and belong

Sometimes you see me coming
And you go the other way
But I keep right on coming
Day after day (day after day) oh

You wanna belong
Belong to someone who will love you
Like you want them to (oh-oh)
You wanna belong
And there's no one who will love you
Quite the way I do
You wanna belong, oh-ooh

You wanna belong (come on and belong oh-oh)
You wanna belong (come on and belong)
Hay-ayy-ay
You wanna belong

// Is It Love That You're Running From //

Make me laugh, make me cry
You don't have to give a lot to me
When I don't really know you are gone
He was weak, you were strong
Or do I have it all completely wrong
Is there a little bit more than you like to say?
Something else that pulled you away
And I've got to ask sometime

Is it love that you're running from
Or is it yourself?
Is it love that you're running from?
Do you think I can help?
Is it love that you're running from
Or is it yourself?
Is it love that you're running from?
Come to me girl, I can surely help

What's the cost? What the cure?
I must say I'm not entirely sure
It's not another case of those well-fed blues
Come inside, lock the door
Even if you've said it all before
We might put something new in that same old line
Something that you're trying to find
And you've got to start somewhere

Is it love that you're running from
Or is it yourself?
Is it love that you're running from
Do you think I can help?

Is it love that you're running from
Or is it yourself?
Is it love that your running from or?
Girl, I gave you some help

Is it love that you're running from
Or is it yourself?
Would you want it woman?
Is it love that you're running from?
Let me give you some help, yeah
Let me help you

Is it love that you're running from
Or is it yourself?
Is it love that you're running from or?
Do you think that I can be some help?

// Reach Out (I'll Be There) //

Now, if you feel that you can't go on
Because all of your hope is gone
And your life is filled with much confusion
Until happiness is just an illusion
And your world is crumblin' down

Darling, reach out
Reach out (reach out for me, reach out for me)
I'll be there, with a love that will shelter you
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through
I'll be there

When you feel lost and about to give up
'Cause your best just ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold
And you're drifting out all on your own
And you need a hand to hold

Darling, reach out
Reach out (reach out for me, reach out for me)
I'll be there, to love and comfort you
I'll be there, to cherish and care for you
I'll be there, oh-oh

You feel that you can't no more
Reach out to me

Oh, I can tell the way you hang your head
That you're without love and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around
But there's no peace of mind to be found
You're alone, no love of your own

Darling, reach out, oh, oh
Reach out (reach out for me, reach out for me)
I'll be there, to love and cherish you
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through (with a love that will see you through)
I'll be there

// Isn't It Strange //

(Ahh) ehh

Will you be there to see me, oh?
To tackle this thing, oh no

For a man who showed her

Please, don't understand
That's not the way that it's supposed to happen, no

Isn't it strange?
Isn't it funny?
If I'ver get your ten, girl
Let you know it by heart
Isn't it strange?
Isn't it funny?
What love imparts
(What love imparts)

If ever I lose my place
Will you be there to turn the page?
Regardless of what it takes
I will be there for the final after

Please, don't run away (don't you run away)
Don't be afraid of what the future's holding, no

Isn't it strange?
Isn't it funny?
If I'ver get your ten, girl
Let you know it by heart
Isn't it strange?
Isn't it funny?

// Love's A Heartache //

You never made it your business, no
You never said that you'd take me there
You never told me you loved me
Yet I know that you care, oh yeah

Love's a heartache (heartache)
Makes you wonder why (why)
It's a heartache (heartache) oh, oh
Give it one more try (try)

The sudden death in the jungle
A true believer in paradise (oooh-oh)
You never answer your feelings, no
But I see it in your eyes, oooh

Love's a heartache (heartache)
Once you come alive
It's a heartache (heartache)
That you love so much (love so much)

All we lack (all that we lack)
It's a bridge of words
Call me back (call me back)
There's too much at stake

I can't bear to love alone
Oooh

Ohhh ohhh

Love's a heartache (heartache)
Once you come alive
It's a heartache (heartache), ohh
That you love so much (love so much)

Shine on me, don't wait
I don't seem to know myself of late
I know part of me is you
I can't seam or separate the two

Love's a heartache (heartache), oh, oooh
Once you come alive
It's a heartache
