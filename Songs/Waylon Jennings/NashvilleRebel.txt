// Silver Ribbons //

Travelin' down this lonesome railroad
Silver Ribbons with no ends
A million miles a crossties
Mark a million miles I've been.

I've picked peaches down in Georgia
Apples up in Maine
Pulled cotton out in Texas
Ridin' on the train.

I was just a lad of seventeen
My daddy turned me loose
Silver ribbons callin' me
Engine and caboose.

I can't recall my mother
She left when I was two
Brunetts, blondes and red heads
Were the only love I knew.

Don't ask me where I'm going
Don't ask me where I've been
Those silver ribbons will take me there
There and back again.

One more time back again

Travelin' to the tune of freight wheels
Is such a lonely sound
Hear that lonesome whistle blow
As leavin' another town.

I wish someone was waitin'
Somewhere to welcome me
Then those silver ribbons
Would see no more of me.

Don't ask me where I'm going
Don't ask me where I've been
Those silver ribbons will take me there
There and back again...

// Nashville Bum //

I've been chasin' the big wheels all over Nashville
Waitin' for my big break to come
Livin' on ketchup soup homemade crackers and coolaid
I'll be a star tomorrow but today I'm a Nashville bum.

I love good and cowboy clothes and I sing through my nose
Webb said that's the way that getter done
I smoke good old PA like the Opry stars they say
I'll be a star tomorrow but today I'm a Nashville bum.

[Instrumental]

Well, a friend of a friend of mine is a friend of art divider
And he finally got me on the Opry show
I'll walk up like a star tripped and busted my guitar
I'll be a star tomorrow but today I'm a Nashville bum.

Well now here's a song I wrote by myself note to note
With a lot of help it might make No 1
You can change a word or two and I'll give half of it to you
I'll be a star tomorrow but today I'm a Nashville bum.

Yes, I'll be a star tomorrow but today I'm a Nashville bum...

// Green River //

Green River, I've come back to you do you remember me
Do you remember Molly with the soft blue eyes
I left here with a lot of dreams none of them came true
What I wanted was here waiting all the time.

Green River, did she come here every evening
Like the neighbors say she did so faithfully
Green River, has she's gone away forever
She just disappeared one day as she gave upon me.

Green River, if you see her won't you tell her I'll return
All I've brought her is myself and this little dream
Please tell her that I love her and my lesson I have learned
Green River, tell her please come back to me...

// Nashville Rebel //

They call me the Nashville Rebel
They say leave that boy alone
Don't you give him advice or he'll turn to ice
And you might as well talk to stone.

But I've got things to do
And things to say in my own way
I don't have time for your parties
My love's little guessin' games.

I've got songs to write in the still of night
I was born to write and sing
And I've got things to do
And things to say in my own way.

[Instrumental]

They call me the Nashville Rebel
Little girl don't you waste your time
For I've given my heart to this old guitar
You deserve a better love than mine.

And I've got things to do
And things to say in my own way
I'm the Nashville Rebel
I'm alone and I like it fine.

I'd like to have a wife and live a normal life
But I just don't have the time
'Cause I've got things to do
And things to say in my own way.

I've got things to do and things to say
In my own way...

// I'm A Long Way From Home //

I'm a long way from home and so all alone
Homesick like I never thought I'd be
I'm a long way from home, everything is wrong
Someone please watch over me.

I'm not acustomed to this feeling
Loneliness is burning in my soul
Sometimes the mind is so mistreating
I wish I'd stayed at home like I was told.

[Instrumental]

I wish I knew the force within me
That keeps my mind out of control
What makes me reach for things that I can't see
I wish I'd stayed at home like I was told.

I'm a long way from home and so all alone
Homesick like I never thought I'd be
I'm a long way from home, everything is wrong
Someone please watch over me...

// Tennessee //

Tennesee, oh what I'd give to be back there
Once again with all the old friends
Who were so kind to me oh Tennessee
I was happy as could be.

Never got too much done
But livin' sure was fun in Tennessee
This big city just depresses me
Though everybody's as kind as can be.

A homesick feeling possesses me
I won't be the same till I'm back there again
Tennessee guess the country boy in me
Won't ever be at ease till I feel that southern breeze in Tennessee.

I won't ever be at ease
Till I feel that southern breeze in Tennessee...

// Norweigan Wood //

I once had a girl
Or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room, isn't it good
Norwegian Wood?

She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair.

I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
It's time for bed.

[Instrumental]

She told me she worked in the morning
And started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath.

And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire, isn't it good
Norwegian Wood?...
