// Don't Think Twice, It's All Right //

Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It will never do anyhow
When your rooster's a crowing at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason why I'm traveling on
But don't think twice, it's all right

An it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, baby
The light I never knowed
An it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, baby
I'm on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was somethin' I could do or say
To try and make you change your mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right

Well it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
It ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can't hear you any more
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right

So long honey baby
Where I'm bound, I cannot tell
But goodbye's too good a word, gal
So I'll just kinda say "Fare thee well"
Now I'm not saying that you treated me unkind
You could have done a lot better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right

// River Boy //

I was born and raised on the river
It's the only life that I know
People 'round here have put a name on me
And I hear it wherever I go
They call me river boy, river boy
Good for nothin' river boy
This old world don't hold a whole lot of joy
When you're nothin' but a river boy
I do a lot of fishin' on the river
To make my livin' you see
When I take my catch to the market place
The people call out to me
And they say, river boy, hey river boy
You got any fish today there, river boy
I sell my ware, but nobody cares 
About the feelin's of the river boy
There's a pretty girl works at the market place
I see her there everyday
But when I try to talk to her 
I can hear her papa say
Come away from that River boy, he's a river boy
Nothin' but riff-raff, them river boys
No girl of mine is gonna waste her time
On a good for nothin' river boy
So I head my boat back up the river
Back to my old fishin' place
I'm afraid this ol' river's gonna overflow
From the tears a-fallin' down my face
I'm nothin' but a river boy, river boy
A good for nothin' river boy
This old world don't hold a whole lot of joy
When you're nothin' but a river boy
River boy, river boy
A good for nothin' river boy
River boy [fade]

// Twelfth Of Never //

You ask me how much I need you, must I explain
I need you, oh my darling, like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love you, I'll tell you true
Until the Twelfth of Never, I'll still be loving you

Hold me close, never let me go, hold me close, melt my heart like April snow

I'll love you 'til the bluebells forget to bloom
I'll love you 'til the clover has lost its perfume
And I'll love you 'til the poets run out of rhyme
Until the Twelfth of Never, and that's a long, long time

Hold me close, never let me go, hold me close, melt my heart like April snow

I'll love you 'til the bluebells forget to bloom
I'll love you 'til the clover has lost its perfume
And I'll love you 'til the poets run out of rhyme
Until the Twelfth of Never, and that's a long, long time
Until the Twelfth of Never, and that's a long, long time, a long, long time

// The Race Is On //

I feel tears wellin' up cold and deep inside
Like my heart's sprung a big break
And the stab of loneliness, sharp and painful
That I may never shake.

You might say I was taking it hard
Oh, she wrote me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I may break right down and bawl.

[Chorus:]
Well, the race is on
And here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches a-going to the inside
My tears are holding back
And tryin' not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all.

[Instrumental]

One day I ventured in love, never once suspectin'
What the final results would be
How I lived in fear of waking up each mornin'
And finding that you're gone from me.

There's aches and pain in my heart
For today was the one that I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win her
I wound up in second place.

[Chorus:]
Well, the race is on and here comes pride
Up the backstretch
Heartaches a-going to the inside
My tears are holding back
And tryin' not to fall
My heart's out of the running
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all...

// House Of The Rising Sun //

There is a house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising sun
It's been the ruin of many poor boys and me
Oh God, I'm one.

My mother was a taylor
She sowed these old blue jeans
My father was a gambler
Lord, down in New Orleans.

Go tell my baby sister
Not to do the the things I've done
Outshine that house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising sun.

There is a house down in New Orleans
they call the Rising sun
It's been the ruin of many poor boys and me
Oh God, I'm one...

// Kisses Sweeter Than Wine //

Well, when I was a young man and never been kissed
I got to thinkin' it over, how much I'd missed
So I got me a girl and I kissed her and then
And then oh Lordy, well I kissed her again.

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had uh, uh, kisses sweeter than wine.

Well, I asked her to marry and be my sweet wife
I told her we'd be so happy for the rest of our life
I begged her and pleaded like a natural man
And then whups oh Lordy, well she gave me her hand.

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine...

Well, we worked very hard both me and my wife
A working hand in hand to have a good life
We had corn in the fields and whaet in the bins
And then whups oh Lord I was the father of twins

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had uh, uh, kisses sweeter than wine.

Well, our children then numbered just about four
And they all had the sweethearts a knockin' at the door
They all got married and they wouldn't hesitate
I was whups oh Lord the grandfather of eight.

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had uh, uh, kisses sweeter than wine.

Well, now that I'm old and ready to go
We get to thinkin' what happened a long time ago
Had a lotta kids a lotta trouble and pain
But then whups oh Lord we'd do it all again.

Because she had kisses sweeter than wine
She had uh, uh, kisses sweeter than wine...

// Unchained Melody //

Oh my love my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love
I need your love
God-speed your love
To me.

Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers cry wait for me wait for me
I'll be coming home wait for me

Oh my love my darling
I've hungered for your touch
Such a long lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love
I need your love
God-speed your love
To me.
