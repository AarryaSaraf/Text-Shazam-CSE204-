// Yes, Virginia //

I've been telling you there's someone else, Virginia.
Your not listening and this time I think you should.
But, you've never cared for me, have you Virginia?
So you just can't see how anybody could.

[Chorus:]
Yes, Virginia. There is another woman.
And she loves me like I used to wish you'd do.
Yes, Virginia. There is another woman.
Now I need her more than I ever needed you.

I have never measured up to what you wanted.
I'm through trying now I know, I never can.
That's the reason why I love her so, Virginia.
She accepts me just exactly like I am.

[Chorus:]
Yes, Virginia. There is another woman.
And she loves me like I used to wish you'd do.
Yes, Virginia. There is another woman.
Now, I need her more than I ever needed you.

Yes, Virginia. There is another woman.
Now, I need her more than I ever needed you...

// Brown Eyed Handsome Man //

Flyin' cross the desert in a TWA
I saw a woman walkin' cross the sand
She'd been a walkin' thirty miles on route to LA
To get a brown eyed handsome man.
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man.

Milo Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestlin' match
To get a brown eyed handsome man.
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man.

Way back in hist'ry thee thousand years in fact
Ever since the world began
Been a whole lot of women who sheddin' tears
For a brown eyed handsome man.
It was the trouble was a brown eyed handsome man.

[Instrumental]

Beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mama told her darlin' go out and find
Yourself a brown eyed handsome man.
Just like your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man.

Arrested on charges of unemployment
Sittin' in the witness stand
The Judge's wife called up the district attorney
She said free that brown eyed handsome man.
If you want your job you better free that brown eyed man.

Way back in hist'ry thee thousand years in fact
Ever since the world began
Been a whole lot of women who sheddin' tears
For a brown eyed handsome man.
It was the trouble was a brown eyed handsome man...

// Just Across The Way //

Just across the way a house is dark
I can hardly see
Just a cross the way lives a girl
Who's so in love with me
But I'm such a bitter soul
Who's mem'ries seemed to always get their way
So I live here with my memories.

She lives there with her love just across the way
Just across the way I can see her in the window watching me
With her face rest to the pain
And her eyes look more tearstained every day

But I'm such a bitter soul
Who's mem'ries keep standing in her way
I'm so lonely with my memories
She's lonely with her love just across the way

Just across the way
Might as well be in the heavens on a star
We're just close enough together
To see just what far apart we are
But I'm such a bitter soul
Who's mem'ries keep standing in the way
I'm so lonely with my memories
She's lonely with her love just across the way
Just acoss the way just across the way...

// Don't Play The Game //

The hardest thing you ever do
Is love yourself, that gal don't love you
She'll cause you sleepless nights and endless pain
But if you don't like the rules don't play the game.

Everytime that girl walks by
Your heart will ache your very soul will die
But love's one sided it's just yourself to blame
And if you don't like the rules don't play the game.

You think by now I see the fool I've been
Given my heart a chance to win
Well, I do but I don't, I will but I won't
Deep inside I know I'll do again.

The hardest thing you ever do
Is love yourself, that gal don't love you
With love one sided it's just yourself to blame
And if you don't like the rules don't play the game.

If you don't like the rules don't play the game...

// Shutting Out The Light //

I left the light in my window
Burning bright for you
And the door to this heart of mine
I left that open too.

We once had a love together
I believe that it was true
But now you search for somethin' better
So I'm shutting out the light on you.

Yes, I'm shutting out the light in my window
Locking up the heart that beats for you
This heart of mine can't take it any longer
So I'm shutting out the light on you.

[Instrumental]

I still recall when you told me
But I've made your every dream come true
But we now are dreaming of another
But baby, are you only foolin' you?

If I had a chance I'd wait forever
There's no use pursuing what's not true
This heart of mine can't take it any longer
So I'm shutting out the light on you.

Yes, I'm shutting out the light in my window
Locking up the heart that beats for you
This heart of mine can't take it any longer
So I'm shutting out the light on you...

// I May Never Pass This Way Again //

Little girl don't be so quit to give your love so free
Little girl what makes you want to throw yourself with me
Just in your teens you're lookin' more like twenty one
You run ahead of life when it's only just begun.
Don't you know I may never pass this way again.

Little girl you'd better go before I'd change my mind
Little girl walk away while you still have the time
It's just a part of growin' up someday you'll see
Then you'll wonder what you ever saw in me.
Don't you know I may never pass this way again.

Mama sets home awaitin' you to call by now daddy's lookin' tired
Wonder what can she be and what she's doin' out now late at night
Little girl you better go before I lose all sense and my control
I'll be crossed bridge down on the road
And you'll be left behind to pay the toll
I may never pass this way again.

Little girl wait for him he'll soon be on his way
Little girl you think within what I'd do today
It's just a part of growin' up someday you'll see
And then you'll wonder what you ever saw in me.
Don't you know I may never pass this way again.

I may never pass this way again. hmm...

// 33rd Of August //

Today there's no salvation band's packed up and gone
I'm left standing with my penny in my hand
Down at railroad station a blind man sings his song
I think he sees things I don't understand.

It's the 33rd of August
And I'm finally touching down
Eight days from Sunday
Finds me Saturday bound.

I stumbled through the darkness tumble to my knees
A thousand voices screaming in my brain
Wound up in a squad car busted down for vacancy
Outside my cell it's sure as hell looks just like rain.

It's the 33rd of August
And I'm finally touching down
Eight days from Sunday
Finds me Saturday bound.

I've put my dangerous feelings under lock and chain
Killed my violent nature with a smile
Let the demons danced and sang their songs within my fevered brain
Not all my God like thoughts were defiled.

It's the 33rd of August
And I'm finally touching down
Eight days from Sunday
Finds me Saturday bound...

// Yellow Haired Woman //

Yellow haired woman
Good for nothing empty headed
Most lovely creature that I've seen
With lips that kiss with such a firy stain
Many times I've dreamed
Of leaving my life behind knowin' all the while
I'm a victim of the smile of this yellow haired woman.

[Instrumental]

Yellow woman flows across this rich satin bed
Magnified of perfect feature leaving nothing left unsaid
As I listen to her breathing suddenly
I find no escape I'm weary kind
Who sets it up my mind it's this yellow haired woman.

[Instrumental]

Many times I've dreamed
Of leaving my life behind knowin' all the while
I'm a victim of the smile of this yellow haired woman...

// Where Love Has Died //

If my years were less, if my shoes were new
I'd pack my things and I'd leave you
Hitch myself to some westbound train
You'd never see me here again.

If I could dream as I once could
I'd be gone gone for good
I don't want to live, haven't another try
In some old house where love has died.

We once had love, it's gone now
Don't know when, don't know how
We're two strangers under one roof
No need to like it, we both know the truth.

Love has gone, there's nothing left
I wanna leave, I can't help myself
I don't want to live haven't another try
In some old house where love has died.

Too many ghosts walk the floor
Ghosts of the love that ain't no more
I'd like to have what we once had
And there ain't no use, that's too bad.

You're too much a part of me
For me to be ever free
We keep living but never try
In some old house where love has died...

// All Of Me Belongs To You //

All of me belongs to you all the time
You're the only one that's ever on my mind
There's no way that I would ever be untrue
There's not one single part of me
That don't miss you through and through
All of me belongs to you.

My eyes're worthless when you're not here to see
My lips would be forgotten if you forgotten me
My arms ached from reaching out to you the way they do
There's not one single part of me
That don't miss you through and through
All of me belongs to you.

Fingers claw the darkness in my dreams
Searchin' for a love I lost, I can't redeem
I'm yours and I can't give my heart to someone new
There's not one single part of me that my heart don't include
All of me belongs to you.

[Instrumental]

All of me belongs to you...

// This Time Tomorrow I'll Be Gone //

Girls have been a weakness all of my life
But I made a big mistake and I took one for a wife
I've thought that she was different I could settle down
But she won't and I didn't by now I'm leavin' town.

This time tomorrow I'll be gone.
This time tomorrow I'll be gone.

[Instrumental]

I'll be a datin' those southern belles there'll be no days of blue
All the queens in New Orleans I'll get around with you
When sun went down I'll come back up I'll be countin' every hour
Till I'm back headin' south for sweet sweet magnolia flowers.

This time tomorrow I'll be gone.
This time tomorrow I'll be gone.
This time tomorrow I'll be gone.
This time tomorrow I'll be gone...
