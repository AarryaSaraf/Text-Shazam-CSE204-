// The Chokin' Kind //

I only meant to love you don't you know it babe
Why couldn't you be contented with the love I gave
I've given you my heart and now you want my mind
Your love scares me to death girl it's the chokin' kind.

You can kill a man with bullets poison or a knife
But it hurts him more to take his pride and run his life
Whatever it is you want girl I hope you find
But that hat don't fit my head it's the chokin' kind.

When you fall in love again girl take a tip from me
If you don't like the peaches walk on by the tree
Find what you want and keep it treat it sweet and kind
But let it breathe don't make your love the chokin' kind...

// Hangin' On //

It's true you have me twisted round your finger
And it seems that's where I belong
You know how to hold me, to thrill me and control me
Just enough to keep me hangin' on.

For now, tomorrow and forever
I guess I'm tied to you right or wrong
My love keeps a growing 'cause your love keeps a showing
Just enough to keep me hangin' on.

A love that's strong as mine
Will make me do most anything
Like hiding tears and heartaches
And dreaming silly dreams.

You've got me where you want me
You keep stringing me along
Just enough to keep me hangin' on.
Just enough to keep me hangin' on...

// Julie //

When I married Julie
She was just seventeen
Pretty as the answer
To any man's dream.

[Instrumental]

From the start I gave Julie
All the love that I've had
Though everyone told me
That Julie was bad.

Julie liked parties
And clothes that fit tight
Drinking and dancin'
Around late at night.

She was everything evil
With the face of a child
But I sat home and waited
While my Julie went wild.

I had built me an empire
With my own two hands
With the money and power
To break any man.

But with all my possessions,
Power and gold
Julie was one thing
I couldn't control.

I gave Julie
All my money could buy
Begged her to love me
But she wouldn't try.

She'd only laugh
Then walk out the door
Each time she'd hurt me
Made me love her more.

[Instrumental]

Now I'm locked in this room
They say I'm insane
And I guess that I'll never
See my Julie again.

I'm a man with a heart
And a tormented soul
And the mind that Julie
Drove out of control...

// The Crowd //

I go out with the crowd, I play the game
Pretending out loud but it don't seem the same
For the heart of the crowd is gone from sight
And my part of the crowd is not with me tonight.

I remember the times, each dance with you
All those crazy things that we used to do
Sometimes we'd wait for the dance and then steal away
From the crowd and the dance till I hide away.

Oh, but you're gone and it's not the same old game
I fall apart everytime I hear your name
I'll go on with the crowd of make believe
Till you come back to me.

Run back to me
Hurry back to the crowd and me...

// Let Me Talk To You //

Just one more dance
Just one more chance
So I can talk to you
We've both have paid
Don't be afraid
Just let me try to prove
I would do anything
You want me to.

Just one more dance
Just one more chance
Let me talk to you
Don't go too far.
With that crowd at the bar
That's not the way to win 
Let's fall in love again
Give me your heart 
And let me start 
To build our life anew.

Just one more dance 
Just one more chance 
Let me talk to you
Just one more dance 
Just one more chance 
Let me talk to you...

// Woman, Don't You Ever Laugh At Me //

Yes, I guess I let you make a fool of me
So I'll just go my foolish way and let you be
But if you should find some human in my misery
All I ask is, please don't laugh,
Woman don't you ever laugh at me.

All I expect is your respect
For the pride inside of me
All I ask is please don't laugh
Woman, don't you ever laugh at me.

[Instrumental]

I guess I was just a joke to you right from the start
And the biggest live fool of all those when I gave my heart
Now it's past you don't jest it affects my sanity
All I ask is please don't laugh
Woman, don't you ever laugh at me.

All I expect is your respect
For the pride inside of me
All I ask is please don't laugh
Woman, don't you ever laugh at me.

Uhuh woman, don't you ever laugh at me...

// Gentle On My Mind //

It's knowing that your door is always open and your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shacked by forgotten words and bons
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
Keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be planted on their columns now that binds me
Or something that somebody said because they thought we fit together walkin'
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheet fields and the clothes lines
And the junk yards and the highways come between us
And some other woman 's cryin' to her mother cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walking on the back roads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind
I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurglin' cracklin' caltron in some train yard
My beard a roughen coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands round a tin can I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waving from the back roads by the rivers of my mem'ry
Ever you're just gentle on my mind

// Right Before My Eyes //

You do the things that hurt me
So right before my eyes
Just because I love you so
I overlook your lies.

Let you make a fool of me
Yes, that's what I'll always be
'Cause I pretend not to see
What's right before my eyes.

Everyone keeps telling me
What's right before my eyes
Love is blind and I can't see
What's right before my eyes.

[Instrumental]

I can't make myself believe
What's right before my eyes
I thought your love belonged to me
But now I realize.

You couldn't care and act this way
There's nothing I can do or say
Just watch my dream will fade away
Right before my eyes.

Everyone keeps telling me
What's right before my eyes
Love is blind and I can't see
What's right before my eyes...

// Lock, Stock And Teardrops //

Someday I won't come running when you call
The way you hurt me it's a wonder I'm still here at all
Someday you'll wake up and you'll find yourself alone
Lock, stock and teardrops I'll be gone.

I can't go on the way you make me live
Make me cry and every time expect me to forgive
Someday you'll wake up to a cold and lifted dawn
Lock, stock and teardrops I'll be gone.

[Instrumental]

Someday I'll wake up find me strenght and move along
Lock, stock and teardrops I'll be gone.
Lock, stock and teardrops I'll be gone...

// I Fall In Love So Easily //

You don't know what's good for you
You won't leave me alone
I know you've got a family
Sleepin' at home.

Don't make me go out of my way
don't tempt me please
Don't you be so nice to me
I fall in love so easily.

[Instrumental]

I'm all alone and need someone
I guess that it shows
But the things you make me want to do
I'll regret I know.

So don't say things that you don't mean
'Cause I just might believe
Don't you be so nice to me
I fall in love so easily.

[Instrumental]

I'm gonna leave tonight with you
Go on and have your fun
I don't want to be a part
Of what I might have done.

I'm tempted when I think about
The things that might have been
And I'll admit I'd like to try
But I know I couldn't win.

And so instead I'll say goodbye
I know it's time to leave
'Cause you been so nice to me
And I fall in love so easily.

[Instrumental]

'Cause you been so nice to me
I fall in love so easily.

[Instrumental]

'Cause you been so nice to me...

// Looking At A Heart That Needs A Home //

I'm just a stranger in this town
I'm just a drifter looking round
I might stay a lifetime or a week
It all depends if I'll find what I seek.

You're looking at a heart that needs a home
And a little girl to love me and me alone
One who wants a gentleman and accepts me like I am
You're looking at a heart that needs a home.

[Instrumental]

I thought I had found her many times
But love reserves the right to change it's mind
I guess perhaps my ways are strange
But without this cast I can't change.

You're looking at a heart that needs a home
And a little girl to love me and me alone
One who wants a gentleman and accepts me like I am
You're looking at a heart that needs a home.

You're looking at a heart that needs a home...

// How Long Have You Been There //

I've been walking in the shadows for so long
That I forgot the sun could shine
I've turned away from everything and everyone
That wanted to be mine.

Somehow I always shut my eyes and heart
To anything that I might share
Now I'm standing still and I wonder
How long have you been there?

Every path I've taken I've turned around
And quickly closed the door
It seems that all I knew if I ever stop
To feel I want more.

I kept a steady run so my eyes
Could never focus anywhere
Now I'm standing still and I wonder
How long have you been there?

How long have you been standing there
Protecting me from love that shouldn't be
Knowing all along that I would realize
That you were meant for me.

Now, I've got to mend every broken fence
And bridge that I have burned
And clear away the cobwebs
In my heart so I can start to learn.

For now I realize that you've been waiting
Just to teach me how to care
Now, I'm standing still and I wonder
How long have you been there?

Now I'm standing still and I wonder
How long have you been there?...
