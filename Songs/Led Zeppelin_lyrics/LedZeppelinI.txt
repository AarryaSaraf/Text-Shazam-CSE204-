// Good Times Bad Times //

In the days of my youth, I was told what it means to be a man
And now I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home with a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me 'til the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oh

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbours say
I'm gonna love you each and every day
You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part

// Babe, I'm Gonna Leave You //

Babe, baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you
I said baby, you know I'm gonna leave you
I'll leave you when the summertime
Leave you when the summer comes a-rolling
Leave you when the summer comes along

Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, baby, baby
I wanna leave you
I ain't joking woman, I've got to ramble
Oh, yeah, baby, baby, I believing
We really got to ramble (I can hear it calling me)
I can hear it calling me the way it used to do
I can hear it calling me back home

Babe, I'm gonna leave you
Oh, baby, you know, I've really got to leave you
Oh I can hear it calling me
I said don't you hear it calling me the way it used to do?

I know I know, I know
I never, never, never, never, never gonna leave you, babe
But I got to go away from this place
I've got to quit you, yeah
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Oh, don't you hear it calling me?
Oh, woman, woman, I know, I know
It feels good to have you back again
And I know that one day baby, it's gonna really grow, yes it is
We gonna go walking through the park every day
Come what may, every day, oh
My, my, my, my, my, my babe
I'm gonna leave you, go away

Oh, I miss you, baby
It was really, really good
You made me happy every single day
But now I've got to go away
Oh, oh, oh

Baby, baby, baby, baby
That's when it's calling me
I said that's when it's calling me back home

// You Shook Me //

You know you shook me
You shook me all night long
You know you shook me, baby
You shook me all night long
You shook me so hard
Baby, baby, baby, please come home

I have a bird that whistles
And I have birds that sing
I have a bird that whistles
And I have birds that sing
I have a bird, won't do nothing
Oh, oh, buy a diamond ring

You know you shook me, babe
You shook me all night long
I know you really, really did, babe
I said, you shook me, baby
You shook me all night long
You shook me so hard, baby
You shook me all night long

// Dazed And Confused //

Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Lots of people talk and few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below, yeah

You hurt and abuse telling all of your lies
Run 'round, sweet baby, Lord, how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you've been
Gonna love you, baby, here I come again

Every day I work so hard bringing home my hard earned pay
Try to love you, baby, but you push me away
Don't know where you're going, only know just where you've been
Sweet little baby, I want you again

Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Take it easy, baby, let them say what they will
Tongue wag so much when I send you the bill

// Your Time Is Gonna Come //

Lying, cheating, hurting, that's all you seem to do
Messing around with every guy in town
Putting me down for thinking of someone new
Always the same, playing your game
Drive me insane, trouble is gonna come to you
One of these days and it won't be long
You'll look for me but, baby, I'll be gone
This is all I gotta say to you, woman

Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come

Made up my mind to break you this time
Won't be so fine, it's my turn to cry
Do what you want, I won't take the brunt
It's fading away, can't feel you anymore
Don't care what you say cause I'm going away to stay
Going to make you pay for that great big hole in my heart
People talking all around
Watch out woman, no longer
Is the joke gonna be on my heart
You been bad to me woman
But it's coming back home to you

Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come

// Communication Breakdown //

Hey, girl, stop what you're doing!
Hey, girl, you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is that I like about you, but I like it a lot
Won't you let me hold you, let me feel your loving touch

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

Hey, babe, I got something I think you ought to know
Hey, babe, I wanna tell you that I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms, yeah!
I'm never gonna let you go, 'cause I like your charms

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane

Communication breakdown
It's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown
Drive me insane! Yeah!

Communication breakdown
(I want you to love me all night)
(I want you to love me all night)
Communication breakdown

Communication breakdown

Communication breakdown
(I want you to love, yeah)

// How Many More Times //

How many more times treat me the way you wanna do?
How many more times treat me the way you wanna do?
When I give you all my love
Please, please be true

I'll give you all I've got to give, rings, pearls, and all
I'll give you all I've got to give, rings, pearls, and all
I've got to get you together, baby
I'm sure, sure you're gonna call
Oh, when's the last time I done asked you?

I was a young man, I couldn't resist
Started thinking it over, just what I had missed
Got me a girl and I kissed her and then and then
Whoops, oh no, yeah, well I did it again
Now I' got ten children of my own
I got another child on the way, that makes eleven
But I'm in constant heaven
I know it's all right in my mind
'Cause I got a little schoolgirl and she's all mine
I can't get through to her cause it doesn't permit
But I'm gonna give her everything I've got to give

Oh, Rosie, oh, girl
Oh, Rosie, oh, girl
Steal away now, steal away
Steal away baby, steal away
Little Robert Anthony wants to come and play
Why don't you come to me, baby
Steal away, alright, alright

Well they call me the hunter
That's my name
They call me the hunter
That's how I got my fame
Ain't no need to hide
Ain't no need to run
'Cause I've got you in the sights of my gun

How many more times, barrel house all night long, alright
How many more times, barrel house all night long?
Well, I've got to get to you, baby
So, please come home

Why don't you listen to me, baby?
Why don't you please come home?
Why don't you please come home?
Why don't you please come home?
