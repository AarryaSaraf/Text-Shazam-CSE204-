// Whole Lotta Love //

You need cooling, baby, I'm not fooling
I'm gonna send you back to schooling
Way down inside, honey, you need it
I'm gonna give you my love
I'm gonna give you my love

Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

You've been learning, baby, I've been yearning
All them good times, baby, baby, I've been learning
Way, way down inside, honey, you need it
I'm gonna give you my love
I'm gonna give you my love

Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

You've been cooling, baby, I've been drooling
All the good times baby I've been misusing
Way, way down inside, I'm gonna give you my love
I'm gonna give you every inch of my love
Gonna give you my love

Yeah! All right! Let's go

Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love
Want a whole lotta love

Way down inside... woman... you need... love

Shake for me, girl
I wanna be your backdoor man
Keep it cooling, baby
Keep it cooling, baby
Keep it cooling, baby
Keep it cooling, baby

// What Is And What Should Never Be //

And if I say to you tomorrow
"Take my hand, child, come with me
It's to a castle I will take you
Where what's to be, they say will be."

Catch the wind
See us spin
Sail away
Leave today
Way up high in the sky

But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
By taking our time

And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh what fun it all would be
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby
But what is and what should never be

Catch the wind
See us spin
Sail away
Leave today
Way up high
In the sky

But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
By taking our time

So if you wake up with the sunrise
And all your dreams are still as new
And happiness is what you need so bad
Girl, the answer lies with you

Catch the wind
See us spin
Sail away
Leave today
Way up high
In the sky

But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
By taking our time

Oh the wind won't blow
And we really shouldn't go
And it only goes to show

Catch the wind
We're gonna see it spin
We're gonna sail
Leave today
Do do do, bop bop a do-oh. My my my my my my yeah

Everybody I know seems to know me well
But they're never going to know that I move like hell
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. Oh Lord
Baby baby babe. Huh? Oh I love ya
Do no no no no no no. C'mon now
I want you now

// The Lemon Song //

I should have quit you a long time ago
Oh, yeah, long time ago
I wouldn't be here, my children
Down on this killing floor

I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Oh, I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Every time I go away and leave you, darling
You send me the blues way down the line

Baby, yeah
Give it to me, baby
My, my, my
Take it down a bit
Give it to me, baby
Keep me satisfied

Trying worry 'bout me, baby
But I'd never get you with myself
Keep on worrying, baby
Can't keep you satisfied
Huh, let me tell you, baby
You ain't nothing but a two-bit no good jive

I went to sleep last night
I worked as hard as I can
I bring home my money
You take my money
Give it to another man

I should have quit you, baby
Oh, such a long time ago, oh
I wouldn't be here with all my troubles
Down on this killing floor

Squeeze me baby, 'til the juice runs down my leg
Squeeze me baby, 'til the juice runs down my leg
The way you squeeze my lemon, ah
I'm gonna fall right out of bed
Bed, bed, bed, yeah

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh

I'm going to leave my children down on this killing floor

// Thank You //

If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more

Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong
With you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die, my, my, my
An inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration â look, see

And so today, my world, it smiles
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
And thanks to you it will be done
For you to me are the only one
Alright, yeah
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness â I'm glad

If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

// Heartbreaker //

Hey fellas, have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long, just watch and see
How the fellas lay their money down

Her style is new, but the face the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile
Like that of one who knows

Well, it's been ten years or maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue

Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rolling along
With the grace of the Lord above

People talking all around
About the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at

One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me by another guy's name
When I try to make love to you, yeah

I try to make love but it ain't no use
Give it to me, give it

Work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried

Heartbreaker, your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away, heartbreaker
Heartbreaker!
Heartbreaker!
Heart!

// Living Loving Maid (She's Just A Woman) //

With a purple umbrella and a fifty cent hat
Living, loving, she's just a woman
Missus cool rides out in her aged Cadillac
Living, loving, she's just a woman

Come on, babe on the roundabout
Ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down

Alimony, alimony, paying your bills
Living, loving, she's just a woman
When your conscience hits, you knock it back with pills
Living, loving, she's just a woman

Come on, babe on the roundabout
Ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down

Telling tall tales of how it used to be
Living, loving, she's just a woman
With the butler and the maid and the servants three
Living, loving, she's just a woman

Nobody hears a single word you say
Living, loving, she's just a woman
But you keep on talking 'til your dying day
Living, loving, she's just a woman

Come on, babe on the roundabout
Ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down

Living, loving, she's just a woman
Living, living, loving, loving, she's just a woman
Li-li-li-li-live, lo-lo-lo-lo-love, she's just a woman

// Ramble On //

The leaves are falling all around, time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams

Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And though "our health" we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

Ramble on, and now the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on, I gotta find the queen of all my dreams

I tell you no lie

Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air
'Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her
Her, her, yeah
Ah, there's nothing I can do now
I guess I'll keep on

Rambling, I'm gonna shake (Sing my song)
I gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song
Gonna work my way, going 'round the world
Baby, baby (Ramble on)
Do do do do do do do do, my baby
I can't stop this feeling in my heart
Every time I think about my baby I think "we gots to part"
Gotta keep on searching for my baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I gotta keep on searching for my baby
My, my, my, my, my, my, baby
I can't find my bluebird!
I listened to what my bluebird said, but I, I can't find my bluebird!
I keep rambling, baby

// Bring It On Home //

Baby, baby
I'm gonna bring it on home to you
I've got my ticket, I've got that load
Got up, gone higher, all aboard
I'll take my seat, right way back, ooh yeah
Watch this train roll down the track
I'm gonna bring it on home
Bring it on home to you
Watch out, watch out

Try to tell you baby
What you trying to do?
Trying to love me, baby
And love some other men too
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Went a little walk downtown
Messed and got back late
Found a note there waiting
It said, "Daddy, I just can't wait."
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it back home, bring it back home to me, baby

Tell you, pretty baby
You love to mess me around
I'm going to give you loving, baby
Going to move you out of town
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Sweetest little baby daddy ever saw
I'm going to give you loving, baby
I'm going to give you more
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it on home, oh, right

Bring it on home, bring it on home to you
