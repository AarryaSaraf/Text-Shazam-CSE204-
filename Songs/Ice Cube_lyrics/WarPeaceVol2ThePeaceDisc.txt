Candied out while you spit yo' last on the pearl
The Don Daada, i'm hotta than holly watta
Wish i was your baby fatha, cuz i got a fuckin' head on my shoulder
And lead in my holster, face on the poster
The kinda nigga that you wanna get close ta'
But you can't so you start the lyin'
Just like that nigga that think he dyin'
Get ta cryin', snitchin' and testifyin'
To all my people if i'm talkin 'bout your baby mama

--You ain't got to lie ta kick it--

[Ice Cube  (verse two)]
I'm a be as real as I can with this
Not just the fake analyst on canabis, who only say that the world is
Scandalist, without findin' out a way to handle this
Dismantle this, either with the rhyme or the fist
How the fuck we get in the belly of this bitch?
I be rich if it wasn't for the snitch
Lyin' to the enemies, wild conspiracies
I'm a say this 'till the day that I die
Seven thirty fives bring on bitches lies
While you bullshitin', I'm hard hittin' like
2pac, I keep spittin' 'till my heart stop
Young niggas tryin' to tell me that i'm played
Once they say you played, nigga you must be payed (HA HA! huh ha)
Pushin' weight since the tenth grade do my thing
Got more plaques than Jordan got rings, nigga sayin'

I hate to see your ass comin' (yep), with your mouth runnin'
Talkin' 'bout somethin' (what?), that ain't meanin' nothin'
'Bout your second cousin (hmm), who be always buzzin'
Where she was or wasn't, who she now fuckin'
Stories by the dozen Punch you got the sequel (what?)
To let you tell it Randy Moss is your people
It's evident, your ass lie like the president
But stretch marks on your mouth is the evidence (ha ha)
How the fuck can your friends be the benjamins?! (punk)
And your little ass car's full of fender benz
There you go on the stand with your hand up (lyin')
Testifyin' about a man that's in handcuffs
We should do you like the Mack said
And if he lie like a crackhead pop 'em like a black head
Let him ooze, let him loose
Let him lie by his motherfuckin' ass on the news (yeah yeah)

[Chris Rock]
Yo Cube, check out this ring, 69 karots

I can collapse or puncture, the lungs of anyone
Give him a chance to spit his last word, unerve

20/20 ain't good enough
Rappers they ain't seein' me, this Jay-O Felony
And nobody can stand three of me

By the thug way, package and transportin' the drug way
Only means of makin' a livin', the Crip and Blood way
I'm on grates when i'm grindin'
I'm on stakes when i'm dinnin'
And on sunday's on the wine
Is you can't calm the savage beast (never)
And I can make your birds rise like geese, K-Mac tell 'em
You sell 'em, I swell 'em, loke (sell 'em loke)
Hard or soft determines how much a nigga sell 'em for
We got the fish scale texture (fish scale)

A hustler countin figures ain't pulled no triggers
Can you dig us, we be the ultimate lick
We's the hitters, that make the ultimate hits
Kinda floss-ey, kinda boss-ey
It's gotta be done my way, do what the {fuck} I say
Top of the pyramid, homey what I tell you
If you leave this Westside umbrella you hit the cellar
Bring me my slippers, black robe, and my globe
and I could rule the world with my eyes closed
(with my eyes closed..)

Chasin dreams, pullin mo' schemes for wealth
But the best thing in life is health, be yourself playa
Television it'll keep yo' ass wishin forever 
You'll never get you life together
Don't talk about death, I got too much life to live
Too many orders to give -- what it is, showbiz
Taught you what a trick and a hoe is (WHAT?)
Showed you what a Six-ty Fo' is (WHAT?)
Lord knows, "In God We Trust"
and everybody in the world wanna be like us (everybody)

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]
To the kids of the world that's waitin for wealth
Waitin for health, you better do for self
Homey that's yo' last cup
Forget about the fast buck; boy, get you ass up
People use yo' brain to gain
Do something that ain't never been done; and we can spend hun's
Wipe our ass with twenties, light our joints with ones
Throw away the guns, have nuttin but fun
And homey we could do that {shit}!
Police have a fit, when yo' paper's legit
We gotta get off the phone, we gotta teach our own
Send your baby to school and she'll come back grown
We got to talk to our grandma's
And she'll help us throught them dark halls, and them pitfalls
Everybody know we got the world to gain
We got to stop the pain, lord stop the rain

[Chorus]

[Ice Cube]
Keep goin, little homey why you slowin?
Keep rollin, little homey why you slowin?

Black and bicantay, with ass everwhere, how you do that there?
A sight to behold, break the mold
Just tryin' to get some before the world explode
I see you tryin' to get caught
Well shake what your mama gave ya, plus what you bought
We fuck and we fought, we laugh and we cry
Told the truth and we lie

[chorus]
You be good to me, i'll be good to you
Anything you want, anything you do
I got my eyes on you, and i'm in to you
Give it all I got, and to keep it hot

[verse two]
Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?
Explain it to your family
It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me--
You know you ain't right standin' at the light
Think it's chocolate with that shit too tight
And if I fuck around and get you in the car with me
Motherfuckers would think I had a star with me
Now see the haterism increase
They hate when you got a dime piece
And I got one shotgun, and I might catch a hot one
When i'm lookin' for love and niggas got none, uhh
If you let me handcuff your wrist
Bonnie and Clyde ain't got shit on this
Cuz Bonnie and Clyde had to take a risk
But most of my money see it's all legit --baby--
It's all about your state of mind
Now what would you do if I handed you a tech nine?
Are you feelin' me?
Would you stay down like Hillary?
Even if you thought about killin' me?

[chorus]
You be good to me, i'll be good to you
Anything you want, anything you do
I got my eyes on you, and i'm in to you
Give it all I got, and to keep it hot

[verse three]
Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?
Explain it to your family
It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me--
Are you the type of girl that would call them folks
Have your man leave the house in chains and ropes
Don't need the kind of girl that'll have me in court
On lawsuits lyin' about demestic abuse
Have a bitch like Judge Judy cussin' me out
Garnish my cheques, reposses my lex
Cuz I come from a place in southern Californi
Where hoes rake niggas for tons of alimoni
But fuck the world don't aks me for shit
Unless you my boo, and i'm fuckin' you
The rest of these broads ain't knowin'
That i'm a have you bumpin' Lauryn, in somethin' foreign
Come thru blow the horn
Stick your wrists out the window
And wave to your kinfolks
Let 'em know who you with
And to your crazy ass daddy, let him know who to get

[chorus]
You be good to me, i'll be good to you
Anything you want, anything you do
I got my eyes on you, and i'm in to you
Give it all I got, and to keep it hot

Now what a freak like you, doin' with a fool like me?
Explain it to your family
It's got to be insanity --because I like what you're doing to me--

// Record Company Pimpin' //

[Ice Cube]
Please listen to my demo [x8]

A nigga told me, the record company's the pimp
The artist is the hoe, The stage is the corner
And the audience is the trip, god damn

[verse one]
Incredible young nigga, you can't belive i'm just one nigga
God damn i've gotten bigger
Intellect superior,
Walk in a room and make the whole interior, inferior
If you look me in my eyes
You might fuck around and loose control of your mind body and your soul
Grab ahold
Undisputed on the microphone, what choo think
If you wink, i'll make you ich think
Did you blink, did you ever drink your own brain matter
Shotgun enima, this ain't no cinema
All praises due to the creator
--for this man here, that can't no nigga stand near--
True, inventor of the double-you
What choo wanna do, i got the red and the blue
Show me one nigga dedicated to raps
I'll show you ten niggas dedicated to snaps
Record company death traps settin' decoys
Just to pimp young b-boys
With a cup full of yak, studio contact
Maniac with a contract
Well turn up the bass and the motherfuckin' treble
About to do a deal with the devil for my vocal level
Bullshit points, plus he want to rub it in
And take all my publishin', god damn
Do i take it up the rectum
Just to rock the spectrum
Give up a right arm, just to do a form
Hell no, all you motherfukers goan leave this bitch limpin'

I'ma keep it simple, it went from "please listen to my demo"
To "get your ass out my limo"

It's essential cuz the record company will have your ass in a rental
If you let 'em, You have to behead 'em
Contracts you never read 'em
CEO's you never met 'em
Sent to an atourney, Burnstein and Burney
Nigga that's his lawyer, ain't got nothin' for ya
Treat ya like they emloy ya, i'm a warrior
Bite you in the ass like a Georgetown Hoya
When they ignore ya cause, you got to hold your balls
Catch a motherfucker slippin' in bathroom stalls
And then you show 'em that you ain't a rookie
Let 'em know that you'd rather have, more points than more pussy
Pimp turned bookie
Now how the fuck i get in so much debt
God damn, we just met
Welcome to the rap game
Motherfucker be confused and broke before he know whats happenin'
You can be the star and fuck women
I'ma just play the back and keep winnin'

Cause you're fuckin with Ice Cube the Terrible
Fuck around, I make your life unbearable
