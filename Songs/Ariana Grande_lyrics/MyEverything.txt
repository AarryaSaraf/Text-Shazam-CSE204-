// Baby I //

Baby, I got love for thee so deep inside of me
I don't know where to start
Yeah, yeah
I love you more than anything
But the words can't even touch what's in my heart
No, no

When I try to explain it, I be sounding insane
The words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue-tied and twisted
I can't explain what I'm feeling
And I say baby, baby (oh-whoa, oh-whoa), baby

(Baby, I) Oh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby, I) Oh baby, baby, I
(Baby, I) All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby
But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (oh-whoa, oh-whoa)

Baby, I'm so down for you
No matter what you do (real talk), I'll be around
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, baby
Baby, I been feeling you before I even knew what feelings were about
Oh, baby

When I try to explain it, I be sounding all crazy
Words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue-tied and (twisted)
I can't explain what I'm (feeling)
And I say baby, baby (oh-whoa, oh-whoa), baby

(Baby, I) Oh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby, I) Oh baby, baby, I
(Baby, I) All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, (baby)
But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (oh-whoa, oh-whoa)
(Baby, baby) Ooh-whoa

Straight up
You got me all in
How could I not be?
I sure hope you know (I sure hope you know)
If it's even possible, I love you more than the word "love" can say, yeah
It's better not explaining
That's why I keep saying

(Baby, I) Oh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby, I) Oh baby, baby, I
(Baby, I) All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby
But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (oh-whoa, oh-whoa)
Baby (baby, baby), baby, I
Oh baby, oh baby, my baby
(Baby, I) Oh baby, baby, I
(Baby, I) All I'm tryna say is you're my everything, baby
But every time I try to say it, words, they only complicate it
Every time I try to say it words, they only complicate it
Every time I try to say it words, they only complicate it
Baby, baby (oh-whoa, oh-whoa)
Baby, baby

// One Last Time //

I was a liar
I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
'Cause you don't want a liar

And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without you

So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise, after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

I don't deserve it
I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me?
At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault
I should've been more careful

And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything
But I got nothing here without you, baby

// Break Free //

If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before

'Cause I can't resist it no more

You were better, deeper
I was under your spell, yeah
Like a deadly fever, yeah, babe
On the highway to hell, yeah

I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

No more, baby, ooh

Thought of your body
I came alive
It was lethal
It was fatal
In my dreams it felt so right
But I woke up every time

Oh, baby

This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

// Best Mistake //

[Ariana Grande:]
How soon do we forget
How we felt
Dealing with emotions
That never left
Playing with the hand that
We were dealt
In this game

Maybe I'm the sinner
And you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending
What we ain't
Why we pointing fingers
Anyway
When we're the same

Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up
Our minds
And stop acting like we're blind?

'Cause if the water dries up, and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be saving my love for you,
For you

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on

There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on

[Big Sean:]
I guess time's wasting
Tick-tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh?
How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pick-pockets
I guess to go the distance
We might need to pit stop it
Hold up
I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out
Started a family tree
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You ask why I love your mom so much
'Cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos we both ones of ones
And we the oddest couple only human
Except you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down just being honest
When you start as friends it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one then I'm the best mistake you ever had

[Ariana Grande:]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up
Our minds
And stop acting like we're blind?

'Cause if the water dries up, and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be saving my love for you, for you

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on

There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on, yeah
You're, you're, you're, you're, mm
I'll be saving my love for you, for you
(Best, best, best mistake you ever had)
You're, you're, you're, you're, mm
(Best, best, best mistake you ever had)
I'll be saving my love for you, for you

Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

// My Everything //

I cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny, I really miss it

To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying "Sorry" for the sake of us

He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
But now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are
You are
You are my everything
You are
You are
You are my everything

I know you're not far but I still can't handle all the distance
You're travelling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear
Without you and I know "Sorry" ain't the cure
If I cross your mind just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are...

You weren't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away

You are, you are, you are my everything
You are, you are, you are my everything

You are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are my everything

// Only 1 //

I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you

Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself

Lookin' in your eyes
Makes me wonder how
I got so much time
With you when there's more around
I know all the competition that's after you
So I get to thinkin'
Is this too good to be true?

That we're living
In a fairy tale no malice and no lies
Baby, oh,
It's hard to believe
That the love you have inside is only mine
That's how I know

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

As I'm layin' down
With you every night
It still gets to me that you remain by my side
I ain't sayin' that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew when

I wished for living
In a fairy tale no malice and no lies
So baby, oh,
It's hard to believe
All the love you have to give is only mine
That's how I know

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't

Only 1
Be your only 1
Only 1

// You Don't Know Me //

Center of attention once again
They don't understand
They don't understand, no
Then they try to tell me who I am
They don't understand
They don't understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in?
(Perfect picture to believe in)
Then you can't be looking for me then
(Can't be looking)

I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking but there's just one thing, dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love

The same arguments time and time again
And you watch them all happen
But they don't understand, no
Thinking you're the reason that it ends
And he won't be back again
But they don't understand, no

You want a perfect picture to believe in?
(Perfect picture to believe in)
Then you can't be looking for me then
(Can't be looking)

I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
You don't know me

The girl you see in photographs is only a part of the one I am
Don't judge me
'Cause that's not reality
And all I can be is in love with who I'm becoming

Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love
You think you know, but you don't have no idea

I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, you don't know me
I don't need to live by your rules (You don't control me)
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes (You don't know me)
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, but there is just one thing, dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love

My love

// Cadillac Song //

Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you

Summer days with my honey
Worried 'bout not a thing
Back in the day when things were easier than a breeze
Who knew that kiss was the last one?
I never thought we would change
Baby, I'm missing you

Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated, but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you, you, yeah

Memories last forever, so how could I just forget?
Made everything from nothing 'cause time was all we spent

Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you, you, yeah
Mm, oh baby, oh babe

// Too Close //

I want you (Oh)
I want you (Oh)

You know what I want
I know what you don't
I should be the one you love on
Boy, you got my mind playing truth or dare
Daring me kiss you right here

But we've been friends so long
And it seems so wrong
And everyone can see you're perfect for me
But I just can't let it show
I-whoa-whoa-whoa

I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me, and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close
Oh, boy if we get too close
Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close

Remember that girl that you used to date?
She with my ex-boyfriend, that's great
So, what would you do?
What would you say if I said I loved you that way?

But we've been friends so long
And it seems so wrong
And everyone can see you're perfect for me
But I just can't let it show, oh

I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close
Oh, boy if we get too close
Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close

All my ladies, all my ladies
All my ladies, make noise
All my ladies, all my ladies
All my ladies, make noise
All my ladies, all my ladies
All my ladies, make noise
All my ladies, all my ladies
All my ladies, make noise

But I just can't let it show, oh

I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close
Oh, boy if we get too close
Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close
Oh, boy if we get too close
Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close
Oh, I want you, oh, I want you, oh, I want you

(Y ahora vienes a rogarme. Â¿QuÃ©?)
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence

I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson

[J Balvin:]
