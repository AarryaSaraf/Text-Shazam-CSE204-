// 7 Rings (Remix) //

[Ariana Grande:]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Ariana Grande (2 Chainz):]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (This who they waitin' on)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (2 Chainz, yep)

[2 Chainz:]
My ideas are priceless, I know I'm the nicest
I knew you would like this, I must be psychic
I'm from the streets, baby, I'm nothing like them (Tru)
She's sweet in the day, but freaky when night come (Tell 'em)
It's mine, invest it (Uh); I spend it on necklace (Uh)
I got the cash if I don't get credit (Uh)
And I'm well respected so she feel protected
So scratch all the exes (Ex), it's next like contestants (Woo)
It's blessings, no stressing, I'm flexing
Got one car parked right in the entrance
Got one car parked right at the exit
See, you didn't expect this, you think like a robot
I put bands in yo face like Botox

[Ariana Grande (2 Chainz):]
(Yeah) I want it (Yeah), I got it, I want it, I got it (Uh)
I want it, I got it (Uh), I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Ariana Grande:]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)

// A Little More Homework //

[Evan:]
If you stand here behind me
And you call me a man
And you're counting on me to come through
You should know that I'll give you the best that I can
But we all have a little more homework to do

If you're walking beside me
And you wanna be friends
You should know I'm depending on you
So you gotta hang in there 'til the whole story ends
'Cause we all have a little more homework to do

I've been looking in the back of the book for the answers
Hoping the bell wouldn't chime
But I'm not ready to put down my pencil just yet
There are too many answers that I didn't get
I need a little less pressure and a little more time

I'm trying to follow
I'm trying to lead
I'm trying to find what is true
But if you're gonna stand with me
Then you have to concede
That we all have a little more homework to do

[Charlotte:]
Day turns to day turns to day turns to day
Turns to day turns to day
You get a little bit older, a little bit taller
A little bit better, a little bit
Day turns to day turns to day turns to day turns to day
And the days before all go too fast
You can't hold on
So, you go

[Charlotte, Richie & Evan:]
Day turn to day turns to day turns to day
Turns to day turns to day

[Evan:]
And I'm a little bit older, a little bit stronger
A little bit smarter
A little bit

Day turns to day, turns to day, turns to day, turns to day
And the days ahead coming on so quick
You can't get out of the way
You keep running

[All:]
Day turns to day turns to day turns to day
Turns to day turns to day
And I'm a little bit older, a little bit faster
A little bit closer, a little bit
Day turns to day turns to day turns to day turns to day turns to day
And the sky goes blue and the sky goes black
And no matter what you do, you can't go back!
You go day into day into dayâ¦

[Evan:]
I turned thirteen, my parents got divorced. And I moved from New York City to the middle of nowhere

[All:]
Day into day into day

[Patrice:]
I turned thirteen, and I kissed a boy. More than once!

[Kendra:]
I turned thirteen and signed a virginity pledge

[All:]
Day turns to day turns to day turns to day turns to day turns to dayâ¦

[Lucy:]
I was diagnosed with an eating disorder

[Brett:]
I failed math. But we won the championship!

[All:]
And I'm a little bit braver, a little bit broader
A little bit brighter, a little bitâ¦

[Archie:]
I turned thirteen and I had to have spinal cord surgery. God, that sucked

[All:]
Day turns to day turns to day

[Eddie:]
I got busted for driving my Dad's pickup

[All:]
Day turns to day turns to day!

[Charlotte:]
I got drunk!

[Molly:]
And I've been lookin' in the back of the book for the answers
Hoping the bell wouldn't chime

[Malcolm:]
My parents split up

[Cassie:]
But I'm not ready to put down my pencil just yet

[Richie:]
There are too many answers that I didn't get

[Simon:]
I need a little less pressure

[All:]
And a little more time

I'm trying to follow, I am trying to lead
I am trying to learn what is true
I am trying to be what you want and I need
And we all have a little more homework
We all have a little more homework
We all have a little more homework
To do

Day turns to day turns to day turns to day turns to dayâ¦
A little more homework to do
Day turns to day turns to day turns to day turns to dayâ¦
A little more homework to do
Day turns to day turns to day turns to day turns to dayâ¦

[Evan, Archie & Patrice:]
A little more homework to do

[Others:]
Day turns to day turns to day turns to day turns to dayâ¦

[Evan:]
A little more homework to do

[Others:]
Day turns to day turns to day turns to day turns to dayâ¦

[Evan:]
My name is Evan Goldman. I live at 24 Plains Drive, Appleton, Indiana. I'm thirteen years old. And I'm just getting started

// ABC //

You went to school to learn, boy
Things you never, never knew before
Mmmhmm, like "I before E, except after C"
And why two plus two makes four
Now, now, now I'm gonna teach you all about love, boy
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy

Reading, writing, arithmetic
Are the branches of the learning tree
But without the roots of love every day, boy
Your education ain't complete
Te-te-te-teacher's gonna show you how to get an "A" (how to get an "A")
Spell "me" and "you" and add the two
Listen to me, baby, that's all you gotta do

A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3
That's how easy love can be
That's how easy love can be
Sing a simple melody
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon boy

Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it shake it, baby
1, 2, 3, baby
A, B, C, baby
Do-re-mi, baby
That's how easy love can be

A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy

Lemme teach how to sing it out
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, lemme show you what it's all about

A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy
A, B, C
Easy as 1, 2, 3
Or simple as do-re-mi
A, B, C
1, 2, 3, baby, you and me, boy

A, B, C
1, 2, 3
A, B, C
1, 2, 3
Baby, you and me

// All My Love //

Sometimes I think we're the brightest stars
And I try to believe we'll find a way
Will life change, will our hearts turn colder?
Major Lazer

All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
We can stay out of the trouble is it worth the blame?
Is it true that the more you give the more they take?
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

[Pre-chorus:]
Only love will make us ache
Only love is worth the chase
All my love I know we're waitin' for this
On the rocks up on the mountain tops

[Chorus:]
All my love [3x]
Up on the mountain top

All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say
We're just a mess of broken people but we love the game
I would do anything for us, it's worth the pain
All the rhythms in my heart lift me up and say

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus 2x]

You're always on my mind,
Oh, there'll come a dayâ
Day where we can fly,
Reach the glory haze
High up in the sun and a brighter sky, sun and a brighter sky

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

// Bad To You //

[Nicki Minaj (Normani):]
Hello, Charlie
Ariana, Normani, uh, let's go

[Normani:]
Baby, I've been feeding the addiction
Flying from there and back
Felt like an acrobat
Brown eyed so I fell into submission
Needed to catch myself
Like "What the hell?"

Now we pull your chain
Just to wake you up, wake you up
Push you 'til you break
Now you're stepping up, stepping up, huh huh

[Normani {Dua Lipa} (Ariana Grande):]
Why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you?
{Why are you only?}
Why are you only good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I'm bad to you?
{Why are you only?}
Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
Tell me why are you only good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I'm bad to you?
{Why are you only?}

[Ariana Grande:]
Stopped thinking like a victim
This time, I'll throw it back
Boy, can you handle that?
Got you trippin', gave you no attention
That's when I figured out
What you're about

Now we pull your chain
Just to wake you up (Yeah), wake you up (Yeah)
Push you 'til you break
Now you're steppin' up, steppin' up, ah, ah

[Ariana Grande {Dua Lipa} *Nicki Minaj*:]
Why are you only good to me (Hey)
When I'm bad to you?
{Why are you only?}
Why are you only good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I'm bad to you? (So bad)
{Why are you only?}
Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
Tell me why are you only good to me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
*When I'm bad to you?*
{Why are you only?}

[Nicki Minaj:]
Mm, ayo
Why you only nice when I get bad, boy, psha
Get back on your job like you employed, boy, psha
You know that I'm saucy, got that sauce, soy, psha
I ain't 'bout to stay up on this merry-go-round and round
'Cause we go 'round and 'round
But I don't want no clowns around me (Brrr)
I tell 'em, "Who is you cuffin'?"
I got 'em huffin' and puffin'
He keep on callin' me "baby"
Like I'm a bun in the oven
I said

[Ariana Grande (Dua Lipa) {Normani} *Nicki Minaj*:]
Why are you only good to me {Oh yeah}
*When I'm bad to you?* (When I'm bad to you)
(Why are you only?)
Why are you only good to me {Oh} (, oh, eh)
*When I'm bad to you?* (When I'm bad to you)
(Why are you only?)
Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
Tell me why are you only good to me {So good, uh}
When I'm bad to you?
(Why are you only?)

// Beauty And The Beast //

[Ariana Grande:]
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly

[John Legend:]
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
[Both:]
Beauty and the Beast

Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise

Ever just the same
[John Legend:]
And ever a surprise
[Both:]
Ever as before
[Ariana Grande:]
And ever just as sure
[Both:]
As the sun will rise

[Ariana Grande:]
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
[Both:]
Bitter-sweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong

[John Legend:]
Certain as the sun
[Ariana Grande:]
Certain as the sun
[John Legend:]
Rising in the east
[Ariana Grande:]
Tale as old as time
[John Legend:]
Song as old as rhyme
[Both:]
Beauty and the Beast

[Ariana Grande:]
Tale as old as time
[John Legend:]
Song as old as rhyme
[Both:]
Beauty and the Beast

Beauty and...
Beauty and the Beast

// Boyfriend //

[Ariana Grande:]
I'm a motherfuckin' train wreck
I don't wanna be too much
But I don't wanna miss your touch
And you don't seem to give a fuck
I don't wanna keep you waiting
But I do just what I have to do
And I might not be the one for you
But you ain't allowed to have no boo

'Cause I know we be so complicated
But we be so smitten, it's crazy
I can't have what I want, but neither can you

You ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend)
And I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
But you don't want me to see nobody else
And I don't want you to see nobody
But you ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend)
And I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
But you don't want me to touch nobody else (Nobody)
Baby, we ain't gotta tell nobody

[Mikey:]
Even though you ain't mine, I promise the way we fight
Make me honestly feel like we just in love (Love)
'Cause, baby, when push comes to shove (Shove)
Damn, baby, I'm a train wreck, too (Too)
I lose my mind when it comes to you
I take time with the ones I choose
And I don't want a smile if it ain't from you, yeah

I know we'd be so complicated
Lovin' you sometimes drive me crazy
'Cause I can't have what I want and neither can you (No, no)

[Ariana Grande:]
You ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend)
And I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
But you don't want me to see nobody else
And I don't want you to see nobody
But you ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend)
And I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
But you don't want me to touch nobody else (Nobody)
Baby, we ain't gotta tell nobody

[Scootie (Ariana Grande):]
I wanna kiss you (Yeah), don't wanna miss you (Yeah)
But I can't be with you 'cause I got issues (No)
Yeah, on the surface, seem like it's easy
Careful with words, but it's still hard to read me
Stress high when the trust low (Mmm)
Bad vibes, where'd the fun go? (Oh)
Try to open up and love more (Love more)
Try to open up and love more

[Scootie & Ariana Grande:]
If you were my boyfriend
And you were my girlfriend
I probably wouldn't see nobody else
But I can't guarantee that by myself

[Ariana Grande:]
You ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend, you ain't my boyfriend)
And I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend, I ain't your girlfriend)
But you don't want me to see nobody else (Nobody)
And I don't want you to see nobody
But you ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend, you know you ain't my boyfriend)
And I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend, yeah, mmm)
But you don't want me to touch nobody else (Nobody)
Baby, we ain't gotta tell nobody (Oh yeah)
You ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend)
And I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
But you don't want me to see nobody else
And I don't want you to see nobody
But you ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend)
And I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend, yeah)
But you don't want me to touch nobody else (Nobody)
Baby, we ain't gotta tell nobody

// clarity //

I got weak and I just decided
I would check on you, say hello
It's been so long about six months
Since we split the harmony you went solo
I went partying, had the time of my life
Too young to cry a little
I swear I've been fine
I just wanted to hear your voice
But that's okay, though, say

Tell me why you expected me to miss you
Trust me I've been holding up
Tell my gut, stands corrected
It's official, we feel better broken up
And just friends (just friends)
But your attitude is like you suffering (suffering)
Then the voice in my head jumps in (jumps in)
I am clear, thank you for nothing

I guess that's why I wanna thank you so much for this clarity
Your participation in my new found bliss
I never knew that life could be effervescent
Like this

// Die For You (Remix) //

[The Weeknd:]
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah

You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin', 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh

[The Weeknd (Ariana Grande):]
Even though we're goin' through it
(Aah, ah)
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you (Ooh, ooh)
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

The distance and the time between us
(The distance and the time)
It'll never change my mind
'Cause baby, I would die for you
(I would die for you)
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

[Ariana Grande:]
I'm finding ways to stay concentrated
On what I gotta do
Baby boy, it's so hard 'round you
And yes, I'm blaming you
And you know I can't fake it, now or never
And you insinuating that you think we might be better
Better me and you
Yeah, I know you do (Ooh, oh)

You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
It ain't workin', 'cause you're perfect
And I know you deserve it
I can't walk away

[The Weeknd (Ariana Grande):]
Even though we're goin' through it
(Even though)
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
(I would die for you)
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind
'Cause baby, I would die for you, uh
(I would die for you)
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
(I would die for you)

[The Weeknd:]
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
I'm just sayin', yeah
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na

[The Weeknd (Ariana Grande):]
Even though we're goin' through it
(Ooh, oh, boy)
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind
'Cause baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
Oh, babe

// Die In Your Arms //

Hmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright
Hmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright

Say you love me as much as I love you, yeah
Would you hurt me, baby?
Could you do that to me, yeah?
Would you lie to me, baby?
'Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy?
Leave my heart still at the door?

Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
'Cause every time you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh, it feels so right
Yeah, yeah
So, baby, baby, please don't stop boy

You know, this ain't the first time this has happened to me
This lovesick thing
I like serious relationships, and uh
A girl like me don't stay single for long
'Cause every time a boyfriend and I break-up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug comes right back up and bites me
And I'm back

Oh, if there is a reason to call me a fool
'Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules, baby?

// Don't Dream It's Over //

[A:]
Hey, hey
There is freedom within
There is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead
Many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

[M:] Hey now, hey now
[A:] Don't dream it's over
[M:] Hey now, hey now

[M:] They come, they come
[M & A:] To build a wall between us
[A:] And we know they won't win

[M:]
Now I'm towing my car
There's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion, but there's no proof
In the paper today
Tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the TV page

Get it!
I'm a unicorn if you can't tell

SORRY, I was flirting, sorry,
Alright, anyway

[M:] Alright, everybody sorry, I'll fuck off, here we go, I'm sorry here

[A:] Now I'm walking again
To the beat of a drum

Barely clearing the roof

// Emotions //

I feel good, I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love, I'm alive
Intoxicated, flying high
It feels like a dream

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

I feel good, I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love, I'm alive
Intoxicated, flying high
It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

In the morning, when I rise
You are the first thing, on my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine
If feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel
Inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

You know the way to make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so
High

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

You got me feeling high

// Esta Noche //

Esta noche tengo (Esta noche)

Uh, he said he want him a 'Rican, a foreign thing, no English-speakin'
No hablo inglÃ©s at all when we freakin'
It's always intriguin' 'cause I gotta do all the teachin'
Â¿CÃ³mo se dice "You handsome?"
This is God, baby, this wasn't random
I might just let you sleep over my mansion
Then wake you up to sweet pussy and plantains
Oye, you nasty, oh, ya tÃº sabe
Me gusta cuando que tÃº tiene hambre
I call you papi and you call me mami
Yo tengo jugo de swag en mi sangre
Oye

We came from favelas
Livin' a life like novelas
She gettin' money, respect her
This a real bitches fiesta
Esta noche tengo

Uh, he said I'm driving him loco, he know I'm too fly to be local
Any friend of mine gotta be fine anti-social
And Grande, she don't like 'em broke, yo tampoco
He fell in love with the coco
Gave him peace of mind, he spent his last dime on the toto
Siempre sale en mis fotos
Too bad I don't though, 'cuz I don't need no extra promo
Get down with my mafioso
You can decide whether you want it plata o plomo
I do my dirt on the low though
Trap all I know, though
You ain't got whose money? Â¿CÃ³mo?

We came from favelas
Livin' a life like novelas

// Grenade //

Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open?

I gave you all I had, you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask, 'cause
What you don't understand is I'd

Catch a grenade for ya
I'd throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya
Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you baby
But you won't do the same

You wouldn't do the same

Black, black, black and blue
Beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "hey" when you get back to where you're from
Mad boy, bad boy, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face and rip the brakes out my car

I gave you all I had, you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did
To give me all your love is all I'd ever ask, 'cause

You know I'd do anything for ya
Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you baby
But you won't do the same

If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby
But darlin', I'd still

Catch a grenade for ya
I'd throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya

// Hate That You Made Me Love You //

I hate your eyes
Cause when they look into mine, mine, mine
They make me blind, blind, blind
I hate your lips
Cause when you put them on me, me, me
They make me weak, weak, weak

No, this is not, this is not what I wanted
Oh, but you got, but you got your claws in
No way to stop, I can't stop, there's no stopping now

Hate that you made me love you
Last thing I wanted to do
Hate that you made me need you
Need you so bad
Hate that you own my mind, and stole my pride, and took my head too

Been running 'round in circles tryna find the end
Bumped into this shy guy while chilling with my friends
He's eyeing me, sizing me, makes my body weak
He's bringing out the freak in me

And changed my life
When I get around you, I feel this spark ignite

I got that fire
You got me open
You dig it deeper
We take it higher

Say you ain't in it for the spotlight, boy

I don't believe no one no more
Boy, show me what you're in it for
Been on the low when it comes to love (When it comes, when it comes to love)
Said, "Do you like how I look or just how I look on you?"

Cover on a magazine in just two weeks
"Boy to Watch", ain't he just, just too sweet?
Now he ain't even got time for me
I only see him on the big screen
Woke up at like five, and boy, you wasn't here
When it's my fault, she even knows that you're there
Was I just a transition?
Boy, remember where ya come from

// I Have Nothing //

Mmm, I, mmm

Share my life
Take me for what I am
Cause I'll never change
My colors for you
Take my love
I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are
And everything that you do

I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow
I will hold it back again
This passion inside
I can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide

Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you

You see through
Right to the heart of me
You break down my walls
With the strength of your love, mmm
I never knew
Love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive
One I can hold on to?

I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow
I will hold it back again
This passion inside
I can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide

Your love I'll remember forever

Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing

Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
No, don't walk away from me
Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you
If I don't have you, baby ohhh, ooo

// I Won't Say (I'm In Love) //

If there's a prize for rotten judgment
I guess I've already won that
No man is worth the aggravation
That's ancient history; been there, done that

Who d'you think you're kiddin'?
He's the earth and heaven to ya
Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through ya (Oh nooo)
Girl, you can't conceal it
We know how you feel
And who you're thinking of

No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no
(You swoon, you sigh)
(Why deny it? Uh-oh)
It's too clichÃ©
I won't say I'm in love

I thought my heart had learned its lesson
It feels so good when you start out
My head is screaming "Get a grip, girl
Unless you're dying to cry your heart out"

(Ohhh...)
You keep on denying
Who you are and how you're feeling
Baby, we're not buying
Hon, we saw you hit the ceiling
(Oh, no)
Face it like a grown-up
When you gonna own up
That you got, got, got it bad?

No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no
(Give up, give in)
(Check the grin; you're in love)
This scene won't play
I won't say I'm in love
(You're doin' flips)
(Read our lips: "You're in love")

You're way off base, I won't say it
Get off my case, I won't say it
(Girl, don't be proud!)
(It's okay, you're in love)

Ohhh...
At least out loud
I won't say I'm in love
(Shoo do, shoo do, shoo do, shoo do)
(Sha-la-la-la la la, ahh)

Dear diary, it's me again
I know that you've heard this before
Don't laugh at me, I told my friends too
This time I'm mentally ready to go (Sheesh)

Something's wrong as I look around, I'm getting nowhere
'Cause I am not moving, instead, I'm sitting dead still
Something's wrong as I look around, I'm getting nowhere

To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)

Gettin' rid of pictures, all memorabilia (Yeah)
And I know it sounds silly but it's in the way
That's what you gotta do when you're making moves
Yeah, my mind has a better picture of your face (Sheesh)

Something's wrong as I look around, I'm getting nowhere
'Cause I am not moving, instead, I'm sitting dead still
Something's wrong as I look around, I'm getting nowhere
I thought I was on an escalator but I'm really on a treadmill

Hey, I can't get nowhere (Get nowhere)

You think it's funny now?
'Cause I ain't got nowhere
But I got a heart like Wonder Woman (Wonder Woman)
Wonder Woman (Wonder Woman)
Won't be able to run me down
'Cause I won't be there
You'll be looking for your Wonder Woman (Wonder Woman)
Wonder Woman (Wonder Woman)

Something's wrong as I look around, I'm getting nowhere
'Cause I am not moving, instead, I'm sitting dead still
Something's wrong as I look around, I'm getting nowhere
I thought I was on an escalator but I'm really on a treadmill

Hey, I can't get nowhere (Get nowhere)

// Intro / Interlude //

Baby loves, I'm tryna talk to you
There's a boy
And I don't quite know
What to do
Good things come to those who wait
But patience ain't my thing
The way he holds me, shows me, he's the one
For sure the one
I think I'd rather wait for him forever
Instead of having him just for now
At night, just when I look up at the moon
I wonder if he's looking at it too
And I don't know what to do

// Just Look Up //

[Ariana Grande:]
Mm-mm, hmm
Ah, ah

We knew no bounds
Fell at the speed of sound
Ridin' against all odds, but soon against ourselves
You haunted every memory
With no goodbyes, all bad for me
Your pride put out the fire in our flames

Then just one look is all it takes
I feel your eyes, they're locked on every part of me
And then my dumb heart says

Just look up
There is no place to hide
True love doesn't die
It holds on tight and never lets you go
Just look up
You cannot deny the signs
What you've waited for
Don't wait no more
It's right up above you
Just look up

[Kid Cudi:]
(Baby)
Know I let you down, a nigga can't deny it (Uh-huh)
And there's so much I could lose and, yes, that matters (Yeah)
I've been dealin' with madness (Yo)
Wasn't the man you needed (Hmm)
You dealin' with sadness, truthfully, it's all on me (Hmm)
And I'm sorry, my love
I'ma heal your heart, I'll hold it in my hand (Ooh)
Time is oh so precious, we don't really have much left now (Ooh)
Take my hand, baby, never leave you, Riley

[Ariana Grande:]
Look up, what he's really trying to say
Is get your head out of your ass
Listen to the goddamn qualified scientists
We really fucked it up, fucked it up this time
It's so close, I can feel the heat big time
And you can act like everything is alright
But this is probably happening in real time
Celebrate or cry or pray, whatever it takes
To get you through the mess that we made
'Cause tomorrow may never come

Just look up
Turn off that shit Box News
'Cause you're about to die soon everybody
Ooh, I, I, oh, I
Look up
Here it comes
I'm so glad I'm here with you forever
In your arms

// Knew Better Part II //

Say you could turn me on
Boy, but that's about it
You can say what you wanna
But I wouldn't believe it
You could write all them songs
That's the game that you play
Tryna right all them wrongs
But you can't make me stay

'Cause I, see right through you, boy
And I, I (Feelin' you no more)
I ain't feelin' you no more, I ain't feelin' you no more

If you knew better
Boy, you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together

'Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me (Ayy)
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, baby

Make a mistake, you better learn from it
Play with tea, you get burned from it
My daddy always told me, "If he makes you cry
He ain't the one, you better run from him"
He used to get to me mentally
I don't fuck with your energy
If you knew better, you would do better
But you don't know shit, so I'll do better
Got a new 'do, and some new shoes
Just to go with my new boo
Lovin' me like he used to
And I ain't even worried 'bout it this time (Shit)
I know he gon' be the one to treat me just right (Just right)
Never had a motherfucker this tight (Sheesh)
So baby, this is what your soulmate look like
I look good, right?

If you knew better
Boy, you would do better (Hey)
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better (Boy, if you knew)
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together

'Cause ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me, ain't nobody like me
Ain't nobody like me (Oh)

// Love The Way You Lie //

On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
Don't know why I'm still surprised

Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie
Oh yeah

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win
Even when I'm right

'Cause you feed me fables from your hands
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh I love the way you lie

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til these walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh I love the way you lie

// MONOPOLY //

// My Heart Belongs To Daddy //

While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through
'Cause my heart belongs to daddy
If I invite a boy some night
To dine on my fine finnan haddie
I just adore his asking for more, but
My heart belongs to daddy

Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
And so I want to warn you, laddie
Though I know that you're perfectly swell
That my heart belongs to daddy
'Cause my daddy
He treats it
So well

// No Lockdowns Anymore //

Oh, oh, oh, woke up today
Feeling ok, wow this is new
Oh, oh, oh, got the vaccine
And it's been two weeks
There's life in the streets
Hot people at brunch
And I've got a hunch
Mimosas are gonna be bottomless
Oh, oh, oh, turning off Zoom
After fifteen long months stuck on mute

No lockdowns anymore
We can finally walk out the door
The sunlight is a fantasy
It still doesn't feel real to me
No lockdowns anymore
Will they still take my temp at the door?
Shout out to our favorite M.D
Anthony Fauci

Oh, oh, oh, look at my hair
I'm no longer scared to have it cut
Oh, oh, oh, back in the gym where I start to sweat
Um, maybe not yet
Say, "Hi" on the street
Air kiss on the cheek
It's been so long since I've put on my shoes
So, oh, oh, let's hit the club
Or get drunk and get matching tattoos

No lockdowns anymore
Time to go back to work indoors
No more sweatpants or Zooming in
While I really watch Bridgerton
No lockdowns anymore
Traffic is so much worse than before
The world's such a new place to me
What's an NFT? I have no idea. What?

So, oh, oh, been a long wait
I'm so ready for life to re-start
(No lockdowns, no lockdowns)
(Ready for life to re-start)
No lockdowns anymore
Gonna live the next year outdoors
We could see a movie at three
Making plans is like sex to me
It's what we've been waiting for
To embrace all that life has in store
It's time to make new memories
Once you've got the vaccine (Once you've got the vaccine)
Hug your family (It's time to hug your family)
Feeling so relieved (Oh yeah, we're feeling so relieved)
No lockdowns, we're free

A love at first sight made you blind

// on top of everything //

It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like make-believe
Something that the fans can't see
Like a fantasy, except it's real
The fairies tell stories of how we laugh
The rainbow's jealous of what we have, except it's real

Not to be annoying, not to be annoying
But I wanna keep it going
It's like a epic poem except the letters growing
Punctuate it with the moaning, it's so real

You keep me stressed out, stressed out, stressed out, stressed, boy
Stressed out, stressed out
The way you stretch it out, stretched out, stretched out, stretch it
Just stretched out, stretch it out

And it's unconditional
On top of everything, hey
I cannot make this shit up
On top of everything, it's so real

Lucky to be your lover, heartbeat won't lose
Whole-body buzzing, feel it in your shoes
The way I do it, do it, do it, sheesh
Do it, do it, do it, ay

It's like a brand new mornin' every moment it's reloadin'
Not sayin' that it's frozen in fact
It is explodin', when your hand and mine are holding, it's so real

Just stretched out, stretch it out

// One Last Time (Attends-Moi) //

[Ariana Grande:]
I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
'Cause you don't want a liar

And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything but boy, I couldn't give it to you

[Kendji Girac:]
Mon amour, mon amour, mon amour
Sans toi, plus rien ne brille, plus aucun rÃªve ne me tient debout

[Ariana Grande:]
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home

[Kendji Girac:]
Tout seul je dÃ©rive
Si de ta peau tu me prives
Les minutes sont des annÃ©es
Quand le cÅur se laisse aller
Viens, on recommence
On s'accorde une deuxiÃ¨me chance
Rattrapons le temps gÃ¢chÃ©
ArrÃªtons de nous cacher

Mon amour, mon amour, mon amour
J'pourrais changer d'avis mais tu resteras mon seul amour

[Ariana Grande:]
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything, but I got nothing here without you, baby

[Kendji Girac:]
Oui, attends-moi
Si tu t'enfuis, je suis juste un fantÃ´me (juste un fantÃ´me)
Attends-moi
Sans toi, je suis sans vie, sans idÃ©aux
Je sais qu'on ne peut jamais remonter le temps
Pourquoi ne pas s'apprendre Ã  s'aimer au prÃ©sent?
Attends-moi
Si tu t'enfuis, je suis juste un fantÃ´me

[Ariana Grande & Kendji Girac:]
Yeah, I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest, yeah
But stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it, yeah
'Cause I don't wanna be without you

[Ariana Grande:]
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home (Takes you home, babe)
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart, babe
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home, yeah

[Kendji Girac:]
Attends-moi
Si tu t'enfuis, je suis juste un fantÃ´me

This ain't no competition
At least, that's not how I see it
You know this ain't how it's 'posed to feel
And not after what is it, nineteen years?
Well, I hope you smile
Whenever you see me
I might be lovin' you from afar
And when you cry, and when you feel lonely
I hope your tears dry before they fall, oh

I'll be on your side (On your side)
Watching you shine
The sun will rise
I know that shit's your favorite
And after the rain (After the rain)
I'll be okay
I know that you'll still love me
Even though we outgrew it

(Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm)

I think about the moments that we had when we didn't fight
And the times you'd never listen to a fucking thing I'd say
And remember all the secrets that you told me only?
Well, I'ma keep 'em here with me
No matter what, I'ma keep 'em safe with me
And, don't let anyone take advantage of your kindness
Or that precious heart
And don't forget that you bad as fuck
And you deserve the fucking best (Mhm)
Promise whatever you're looking for, I know you're gonna find
Just use your wings girl, and fly (Fly)

I'll be on your side (On your side)
Watching you shine
The sun will rise
I know that shit's your favorite
And after the rain (After the rain)
I'll be okay
I know that you'll still love me
Even though we outgrew it

(Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm)

Oh yeah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey

Y-Y-Y-You think you're so small like you're itty-bitty
Just one match in the lights of the city
Walking by strangers on the side of the street, like
A quarter in a cup will get 'em up on their feet, like
You think you're never gonna make your mark
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like

We can do anything if we try
Can't resurrect Gandhi, resurrect King
But if we put our heads together, we can do anything, like
You don't have to be a billionaire
You don't have to have much to show how much you care, like
Give a wink, give a kiss, like
Give a little happiness, like-like-like

Water like misery
