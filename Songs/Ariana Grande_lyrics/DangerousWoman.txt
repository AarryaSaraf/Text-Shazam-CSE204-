// Moonlight //

The sun is setting and you're right here by my side
And the movie is playing, but we won't be watching tonight
Every look (Every look), every touch (Every touch)
Makes me wanna give you my heart (Ooh)
I be crushin' on you, baby
Stay right where you are, 'cause

I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight, moonlight

I kiss his fingertips as I'm wishing he's all mine
He's giving me Elvis with some James Dean in his eyes
Puts his lips (Puts his lips) on my neck (On my neck)
Makes me wanna give him my body
I be fallin' for you, baby
And I just can't stop, 'cause

I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight, moonlight
(Baby, I be fallin')
You're my moonlight, moonlight

He's so bossy, he makes me dance
Tryna sit in the back of his whip and just cancel my plans
Sweet like candy, but he's such a man
He knows just what it does when he's holding me tight
And he calls me "moonlight" too

// Dangerous Woman //

(Oh, yeah)

Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy (Oh, yeah)

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you

All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
(Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout)
All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside
(Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout)

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you (Eh-eh)
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't (Yeah)
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you (Yeah)

All girls wanna be like that (Hmm-mmm)

All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath like that
You know how I'm feeling inside

I've never been so caught up
Still so into us
I never thought I'd be here
Should've turned to dust
Ooh, let's be honest, baby
This is so unusual
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby
Even if they're beautiful
I used to be cautious
A little too reckless
Now all my emotions
Are all 'cause of you

I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
'Cause we're collectin' moments

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Why it never worked, but it's going to now
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
What it does to me when I feel you around
Is it love? Is it lust? Is it fear?
But it's hard to breathe when you're touching me there
Hard to breathe when you're kissing me there
Hard to breathe when you're not here

I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road

// Touch It //

How do I make the phone ring?
Why do I even care?
How are you all around me, when you're not really there? (Hmm)
When you're not really there? (Hey, yeah, mm)
How do I feel you on me, when you're not on my skin?
Why do you say you want me, then tell me you're not coming in?
Ah, yeah, baby, just come on in (Hmm, yeah)

'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go
Take me all the way (Ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
Take me all the way (Ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it

How do you know I'm breathing, when I'm holding my breath?
Why don't we face the danger, just for the night and forget? (Oh-oh)
Baby, let's just forget (No-oh)
Remind me why we're taking a break
It's obviously insane
'Cause we both know what we want
So why don't we fall in love?
Baby, let's fall in love, oh-oh

'Cause every time I'm with you, I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go

I go into a zone
And I remember all the places you wanna go (All the places you wanna go)
Take me all the way (The way) (Ooh)
No, ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it
(No, ain't nobody gonna) (Ain't nobody gonna)
'Cause every time I see you, I don't wanna behave (See you, I don't wanna, behave)
I'm tired of being patient, so let's pick up the pace
(Patient, so let's pick up the pace)
Take me all the way (The way, ooh) (Ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna touch it, touch it, touch it (Ah-ah, ooh)

// Knew Better / Forever Boy //

[Part I: Knew Better]

Say you could turn me on
Boy, but that's about it
You can say what you wanna
But I wouldn't believe it
You could write all them songs
That's the game that you play
Tryna right all them wrongs
But you can't make me stay

'Cause I see right through you, boy
And I ain't feeling you no more
(I ain't feelin' you no more, I ain't feelin' you no more)

If you knew better
Boy, you would do better
Can't nobody love you like I do
Baby, I could do better
Boy, if you knew better
You would do better
Baby, if you love me like I love you
Maybe we could be together
'Cause ain't nobody like me (Ain't nobody like me)

I couldn't do it, got too used to it, ah
Ain't nobody ever kept my attention
They couldn't do it, yeah boy, they blew it

But you showed me what it means to be happy ever after
In love forever
And you gave me the key to all your love and all your pleasure
Boy, you're my treasure, ah

Oh-whoa, be forever mine, you and I
Oh-whoa, be forever mine, boy, all the time
You're my forever boy
You're my forever boy

So you know what makes me cry
See, you're the one that treat me right

But you showed me what it means to be happy ever after
In love forever
And you gave me the key to all your love and all your pleasure
Boy, you're my treasure, ah

// Thinkin' Bout You //

Oh, yeah, yeah
Ah, ah

I've been thinkin' bout you
Yeah, I've been missing you
Where the hell are you
Oh, when I need you?
I could still hear your voice
I ain't got no choice
'Cause I'm here all alone
I know I can't wait 'til you get home

Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind

I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you

Got these thoughts in my head
Ain't no way to forget
Got me losing my breath
Nobody got me the way that you did
Had my eyes rolling back
Had me arching my back
Now you love me so good
I wish you would hurry up and come back

Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind

I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (About you, baby)
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you ('Bout you, ah)
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (I'm thinkin' 'bout you)
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Say you don't, baby, 'bout you)

Baby, I don't want no one, no one else
So hurry, 'cause I need some, need some, need some help
And I've been waiting patient, patiently
'Cause I don't have you here with, here with, here with me
But at least I have the memory

I'm just thinkin' 'bout you ('Bout you)
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (I do)
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Thinkin' 'bout you, ooh; oh, yeah)

// Jason's Song (Gave It Away) //

Yeah, you really tried
But I was blind to all the lies you told me, boy
All the shit you've done
You can't outrun the way you undersold me, hey

You acted like you bought me at a bargain sale
You don't even care
You focused your frustration on a small detail
Blew it out of scale, like my ponytail

Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why should I listen?
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye, goodbye
'Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
And I'm taking it right back, hey

I'm no blow-up doll, no free-for-all
No slave to your decision, ooh
Gotta find a way to break the spell
To get the hell away from those who block my vision

You used me as a fragment of your grand design, hey
And you, you don't get to put me on your bottom line
You don't get what's mine, and I'm doing fine

Said you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why would I listen?
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye, goodbye
'Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
I'm taking it right back, baby

Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why should I listen?
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye, goodbye
'Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
And I'm taking it right back, hey
Taking it right back, baby
I'm taking it right back, hey
