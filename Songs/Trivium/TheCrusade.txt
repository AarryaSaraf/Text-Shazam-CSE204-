Album: TheCrusade

// Ignition //

Raise the guns
At every self-made suspicion
Build the bombs
Corrupt policy's decision

That's the sound of integrity breaking its back
In a country founded as a thievery act

Raise the guns
At every self-made suspicion
Build the bombs
Corrupt policy's decision

Times are dark with our children spoon-fed ignorance
Inheritance of an anxious trigger finger

Raise the guns
At every self-made suspicion
Build the bombs
Corrupt policy's decision

Our leaders preach if we disagree
We're the traitors of society
Homophobia, racism, sexism
Our system breed supremacy

[x2]
Ignition
Inception
Burning is a fuse to destruction
Break the walls of ignorance
To disarm the world for its last chance

Time again for a war
On an enemy that isn't real
Greedy selfish warlords
Feed the agenda, death's the meal

[Solo: Matt]

That's the sound, impending far crawling up your spine
In a country where nothing its truly made clear

Raise the guns
At every self-made suspicion
Build the bombs
Corrupt policy's decision

Our leaders preach if we disagree
We're the traitors of society
Homophobia, racism, sexism
Our system breed supremacy

[x2]
Ignition
Inception
Burning is a fuse to destruction
Break the walls of ignorance
To disarm the world for its last chance

// Detonation //

[Verse:]
That's the sound of humanity melting away
Say goodbye it's the end of days
Fire rains down on the American dream
Watch all you love see them scream

Each will dig their own graves
And bury themselves in life's failures

It's our bombs we've masterminded lighting the skies
Hideous misfires, many die
Those who survive soon will suffocate
By the poisons we create

Each will dig their own graves
And bury themselves in life's failures

De-to-na-tion, De-to-na-tion

When civilization crumbles, man will turn
On one another, killing true

[Solo: Matt, Corey]

The darkest of time will then come to be
Through our selfish killer instinct

[Chorus:]
And now the ground we called a home
Is but a barren wasteland
The only sound drowning your cries
Is the detonation

[Solo: Corey]

[Bridge:]
It seems I'm running out of time
All good as dead just stand in line [x2]

[Solo: Matt]

[Chorus:]
And now the ground we called a home
Is but a barren wasteland
The only sound drowning your cries
Is the detonation

[Solo: Corey]

// Entrance Of The Conflagration //

A common woman
Lives by The Bible
Wed-locked a prison
Of antiquation
Brings life to the earth
While losing her mind
Trying suicide
Hallucinating Satan

Forcing her own blood down
Beneath the waters to drown
Lying dead with eyes wide open

Spiraling downward
Refusing all help
Self-mutilation
Neglects the children
Dagger licks her neck
Desiring escape
Succumbing Satan
Robbed by the seventh deadly sin

Forcing her own blood down
Beneath the waters to drown
Lying dead with eyes wide open
Believing Satan was inside
Ordering to abide
To destroy her cursed children

Entrance of the Conflagration
Entrance of the Conflagration

Go!

[Solo: Corey, Matt]

Conditions worsen
Searching for answers
In holy scriptures
Systematic plan
Water fills the tub
All of her children
Floating lifelessly
Innocence chased down and drowned

Forcing her own blood down
Beneath the waters to drown
Lying dead with eyes wide open
Believing Satan was inside
Ordering to abide
To destroy her cursed children

// Anthem (We Are The Fire) //

[Solo: Matt]

Just when they thought you were through
You've burned their lies, now you're strengthened it's true
Turn your backs on your enemies
And let those motherfuckers rot in their jealousy

They
Can't stand
That the worlds up for taking and we are adamant
Hell bent
Determined to dominate everything

We are the fire
Resound the anthem

The music connects, unites us more
Our masses strengthened, an unstoppable horde
We're all now a family
Together let's show the world what we say

// Unrepentant //

A poor man with four daughters
A wife and a son.
Daughter commits adultery
Or so he was told

Bought the knife and machete, after Fridays prayers.
Feared the young would follow old, thought all must be killed.

[Chorus:]
For your honour
You will slaughter
Everyone of your daughters
For your honour
You will slaughter
It's you who should be slaughtered
Terror grips the steel with hunger
Thirsting to avenge its soiled pride
A shamed madman
You take their lives away as they sleep
The blade kisses at their throats.
Life bleeds without a chance to weep
You take, you take their lives away

Yet a man of unrepetant, don�t you realise?
You murdered your own children
Call that honourable cause

[Chorus]

[Solo: Corey]

[Chorus]

// And Sadness Will Sear //

Shepherd is chased by the wolves
Wolves who lived by intolerance and hate
For what they couldn't understand

Blinded and vicious are the beasts
Beating and ripping at a beautiful human
Who did nothing more than be himself

Tied to the fence as they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And sadness will sear

Scarecrow is left crucified, left freezing, bleeding
Tied, and wondering why. The wolves just couldn't understand
It's the preachers, and the teachers,
Governments closed-minded creatures
Try to teach us to hate that which is different

Tied to the fences as they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And sadness will sear

It's 12:53 AM
October 12th when the scarecrow died
A victim of society's cruelty
It's 12:53 AM
October 12th when the shepherd died
The candles light will alight your departure

[Solo: Matt]

Tied to the fences as they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And sadness will sear

[Solo: Corey]

// Becoming The Dragon //

[Solo: Corey]

Swimming the river ascending
Free of Fear, filled with purpose
"Nishikigoi fights through oceans of adversity
Against the current to obtain the highest goal

Swim through oceans of suffering
Climb to the falls of Dragon Gate
Become
Transform from a Koi into a beast
Dragon

A living symbol of courage
No wave will shatter these scales (Shatter these scales)
Dreams of three eagle claws and the paws of a tiger,
Waterfall's up ahead, one thing left to do

Swim through the sins of suffering
Climb to the falls of Dragon Gate
Become
Transform from Koi into a beast
Dragon

You'll never stop the becoming, yeah
This dragon will rise and be king

[Solo: Corey]

All bear witness to a great form
Evolution is complete
A breath that turns into clouds producing rain or fire
Watch the world move according to each desire

Swim through oceans of suffering
Climb to the falls of Dragon Gate
Become
Transform from Koi into a beast
Dragon

[Solo: Matt, Paolo]

// To The Rats //

You hide behind barricades
Built of facades, you think you're safe
But someday we all will find you
Come to where you work
And fucking tie you

Every lie
Shoved back
Down your throat
By our hands

A skull fuck
For every word
Just try to breathe
Don't fuck with this

Break every bone in your face
If you mess with my life
Mess with our life
I'll mess with your blood
Bury you in a coffin made of your,
A coffin made of your deceptions

Obsess as each second fades
In denial of your mind made
Still your jealous precedes you
You're really in love
With all that I do

Every lie
Shoved back
Down your throat
By our hands

A skull fuck
For every word
Just try to breathe
Don't fuck with this

Break every bone in your face
If you mess with my life
Mess with our life
I'll mess with your blood
Bury you in a coffin made of your,
A coffin made of your deceptions

This is to the rats
This is to the rats

[Solo: Corey]

This is to the rats
This is to the rats

[Solo: Matt]

And your conscience
Still tears at you
You secretly
Want to be just like me

Go!

A skull fuck
For every word
Just try to breathe
Don't fuck with this

[x2]
Break every bone in your face
If you mess with my life
Mess with our life
I'll mess with your blood
Bury you in a coffin made of your,
A coffin made of your deceptions

// This World Can't Tear Us Apart //

I was so empty
Self loathing
Before you awoke me
Lived in transgression
Feasted sin
Destroying all I stood for

A world of spreading disease
Legs up for infidelity
They force feed of their stiffened sickness
The promised hiding their rings
To suck down some of the things
That cheat this world into lovelessness

All the pain in this world won't stop us now
For we have each other
All the hate in this world can't tear us apart
This love is forever

In arms we'll turn (a)way
From their ways
We live like no other
Together we're hope
Absolute
The only thing that matters

A world of spreading disease
Legs up for infidelity
They force feed of their stiffened sickness
The promises hiding their rings
To suck down some of the things
That cheat this world into lovelessness

[Solo: Matt]

All the pain in this world won't stop us now
For we have each other
All the hate in this world can't tear us apart
This love is forever

All the pain in this world won't stop us now
All the hate in this world can't tear us apart

All the pain in this world won't stop us now
For we have each other
All the hate in this world can't tear us apart
This love is forever

[Solo: Corey]

// Tread The Floods //

Stress, breaking my back
Pulse is stuttering
Pressure, mental attack
My thoughts cluttering

Beating this dead horse
Is exhausting
Heartbreaking
To see my hands shaking
I'm knee-deep in the dead
Still wading
Still wading in this
This well-called life

Nervousness halting all will
Forcing apathy
Anxiety an aching chill
Hammering down me

Beating this dead horse
Is exhausting
Heartbreaking
To see my hand shaking
I'm knee-deep in the dead
Still wading
Still wading in this
This well-called life

Tread the floods
So you can hope to seize
Your own reality
(Be)fore it escapes thee
Watch yourself drown in disarray
It's time to break away
Or we�ll die today

[Solo: Corey]

// Contempt Breeds Contamination //

Mistaken identity
You really got this one wrong
Racially singled out
He must have a gun
And yet you get off with no time
How can this be the answer?
No crime yet they shot away
He now lies dead, the blood is on your hands
Hands which were supposed to protect
People like the man you blew away
This isn't justice, this is corruption

The four protectors fired 41 shots
Hitting him 19 times
Searching the body there were no weapons found
He lies with all who died in vain

Murder must still be a crime
When our inherent freedom
It's hatefully gunned down by who we entrust
And yet you get off with no time
How can this be the answer?
No crime yet they shot away
He now lies dead, the blood is on your hands
Hands which were supposed to protect
People like the man you blew away
This isn't justice, this is corruption

The four protectors fired 41 shots
Hitting him 19 times
Searching the body there were no weapons found
He lies with all who died in vain

Contempt breeds contamination
Contempt breeds contamination
Contempt breeds contamination
Contempt breeds contamination

[Solo: Matt]

How can this be the answer?

The four protectors fired 41 shots (41 shots)
Hitting him 19 times (19 times)
Searching the body there were no weapons found

Contempt breeds contamination
Contempt breeds contamination
Contempt breeds contamination
Contempt breeds contamination

// The Rising //

[Solo: Jason]

And the earth
Begins to shake
A cacophony of roaring
Anxiety growing
Cheers to leaving this mortal life behind

sweat begins its downpour
A riot we stand for
The blackout foreshadows the chaos

So raise your voices with me
And sing this song of unity
So raise your hands up with me
And hold this moment eternally

[Solo: Jason]

Like a rift, opened in the sky
Through fire, pulses and lightning
While thunderous sounds ring
Chanting hymns to leave life's troubles behind
This time shared together is just so much better
Than life could ever offer

So raise your voices with me
And sing this song of unity
So raise your hands up with me
And hold this moment eternally

[Solo: Corey]

So raise your voices with me
And sing this song of unity
So raise your hands up with me
And hold this moment eternally

So raise your voices with me
And sing this song of unity
So raise your hands up with me
And hold this moment eternally

[Solo: Matt]

[under solo:]
So raise your voices with me
And sing this song of unity
So raise your hands up with me
And hold this moment eternally
