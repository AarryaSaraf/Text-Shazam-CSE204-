Our own correspondent
Is sorry to tell
Of an uneasy time
That all is not well

On the borders there's movement
In the hills there is trouble
Food is short
Crime is double

Prices have risen
Since the government fell
Casualties increase
As the enemy shell

The climate's unhealthy
Flies and rats thrive
And sooner or later
The end will arrive

This is your correspondent
Running out of tape
Gunfire's increasing
Looting, burning, rape...

// Field Day For The Sundays //

I wanna be a field day for the Sundays
So they can fuck up my life
Embarrass my wife, and leave a bad taste
That striped toothpaste
Can't remove on Monday mornings

I wanna be a target for the dailies
So they can show
Pictures of me with a nude on page three
So lacking in taste
Touched up near the waist
Looking as limp as Monday morning
Touched up near the waist
Looking as limp as Monday morning

// Three Girl Rhumba //

Think of a number
Divide it by two
Something is nothing
Nothing is nothing
Open a box
Tear off the lid
Then think of a number
Don't think of an answer
Open your eyes
Think of a number
Don't get swept under
A number's a number

A chance encounter you want to avoid
The inevitable
So you do, oh yes you do
The impossible

Now you ain't got a number
You just want to rhumba
And there ain't no way
You're gonna go under

Go under, go under
Go under, go under
You tear me asunder
Go under, go under
Go under, yeah

// Ex Lion Tamer //

There's great danger (danger)
For the loneliest ranger in town
No silver bullets (bullets)
Tonto's split the scene

Next week will solve your problems
But now, fish fingers all in a line
The milk bottles stand empty
Stay glued to your TV set (TV)

There's great danger (danger)
At hand, most caped crusader of all
No cloak of justice (justice)
Robin's quit the scene

Next week will solve your problems
But now, fish fingers all in a line
The milk bottles stand empty
Stay glued to your TV set (TV)

Stay glued to your TV set, oh (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set, oh (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set, oh (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set, oh why don't ya, don't ya, don't ya? (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set, oh why don't ya, don't ya, don't ya? (TV)
Stay glued onto your TV set (TV)

// Lowdown //

The time is too short but never too long
To reach ahead, to project the image
Which will in time become a concrete dream

Another cigarette, another day
From A to B, again avoiding C, D, and E
'Cause E is where you play the blues

Avoiding a death is to win the game
To avoid delegation, the big E

Drowning in the big swim, rising to the surface
The smell of you
That's the lowdown

That's the lowdown
Drowning in the big swim, rising to the surface
The smell of you
That's the lowdown

// Start To Move //

Start to move
Time at hand
Bird in hand
No bush but trees thicken
Which now, rooster or chicken?

Leave the past
Feel the wrench
Smell the stench
Was good, but flesh soon rots
Emotions, we all got spots

Please believe me, I still do care
Please believe me, I'm just not there
Please believe me, I'm just fair
I wanna please believe me
Please believe me
Please believe me
Please believe me
I wanna please believe me
Please believe me
I'm still here
I'm swept

// Brazil //

It's true darling, I'll walk you home
I'll be your date forever
I love you girl, I love you
Until they split the atom

So many times, there's nothing left
There's nothing left at all
I know I'm right 'cause when you're gone
There's nothing left at all

Left right
Left right
Left right
Left right
Left right
Left right, oh
Salute

// It's So Obvious //

It's so obvious
It's here, it's there
It's not just the colour
It must be more
At least seventeen and three score

This is '77
Nearly heaven
It's black, white, and pink
Just think
There's more to come
Hum hum hum hum
It's so obvious

Well, it's alright, just listen
Can't wait for '78
God those RPM
Can't wait for them
Don't just watch
Hours happen
Get in there kid and
Snap them

// Surgeon's Girl //

Sitting in a surgeon's world, a surgeon's will
A surgeon's girl with me
Standing on a river bed, where weeds can be
I'm on my knee, to you
I've seen in glossy mags
I've seen you and you see me
I've seen you and you see me

Said you weren't a tuna fish, put in a tin
They're very big, ha ha
I've seen in glossy mags
I've seen you and you see me
I've seen you and you see me

// Pink Flag //

I was sold up the river to the red slave trade
The stores were gathered, the plans were laid
Synchronised watches at 18:05
How many dead or alive in 1955?

The pink flags were screaming
Bugle boys sucked and blew
No time for confessions, orders given
Books were cooked, on the fourth of the third
How many seen or heard on the twelfth of the third?

How many dead or alive?
How many dead or alive?
How many dead or alive?
How many dead or alive?

How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?

How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?

Yeah

// Straight Line //

My mind is unwilling and your flesh is so weak
Do my movements betray the secrets I think
I always stand by walls and try to humour fools
Am I moving in a straight line?
Am I moving in a straight line?
Am I moving in a straight line?
Am I moving in a straight line?

Oh, it's unlust and the one dimensional boy
Oh, it's unlust and the one dimensional boy
Oh, it's unlust and the one dimensional boy
Oh, it's unlust and the one dimensional boy

// 106 Beats That //

If he had a room, he'd paint it white
Avoids the day, prefers the night
Build sight

Got a head for figures
No time for bickerers, or so he says
Prefers the company of a woman
One, two, three, four

Finds it more physical
That's the important word
Always seen first then heard
Such a rare bird

With praise, he glows
With change, he grows
Finds that important, hates waiting
It's not stimulating, likes celebrating
I can't understand why that is so funny
That is sex

// Mr. Suit //

I'm tired of being told what to think
I'm tired of being told what to do
I'm tired of fucking phonies, that's right, I'm tired of you

All right, no, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit
No, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit, all right

You can take your fucking money and shove it up your arse
'Cause you think you understand, well it's a fucking farce
I'm tired of fucking phonies, that's right, I'm tired of you
All right no, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit
No, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit, ow

And if you turn and walk out that door
And take your fucking money, let me tell you what it's for
I'm tired of fucking phonies, that's right, I'm tired of you

All right, no, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit
No, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit
No, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit

// Strange //

There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right
Joey's nervous and the lights are bright
There's something going on that's not quite right

There's something going down that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
No one's gonna save your life
There's something going on that's not quite right, uh-huh

Deep end, deep end

There's something going down that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
No one's gonna save your life
There's something going on that's not quite right, uh-huh

There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right
Joey's nervous and the lights are bright
There's something going on that's not quite right

There's something
There's something, there's something
There's something, there's something
There's something, there's something
There's something, there's something
There's something

// Fragile //

Tears fall in slivers, you broke my shades
The light too bright, let me bury my heart
Filter emotions of green, cowardicee gives blue
A restricted view, let me open my heart

I have a fleeting love
Searching when it lands
Fragile, needing precious hands
Fragile

You eat my energy, give me more rope
Nail in the wall, let me hang my heart

I have a fleeting love
Searching when it lands
Fragile, needing precious hands
Fragile

// Mannequin //

Well, you're a waste of space
No natural grace
You're so bloody thin
You don't even begin

To interest me
Not even curiosity
It's not animosity
It's just you don't interest me

You're an energy void
A black hole to avoid
No style, no heart
You don't even start

To interest me
Not even curiosity
It's not animosity
It's just you don't interest me
Oh, come on

You disgrace
Tell me
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?

Tell me
Why don't you tell me?
Tell me
Why don't you tell me?

Last time now
Tell me
Why don't you tell me?

// Different To Me //

Well, I wonder what's going on
Same old stuff suppose
Not quite right that
The stuff's the same but seems different to me
Seems like the cancer in the city has got to be terminal
I haven't got it through
Incidentally, where are you?
Thought you lived here
The bright lights have got you
I'd rather be a sprat than a mackerel
You can slip through the net
It's set
It also takes one to catch one

// Champs //

The race of champions, the pace, the pace
The speed the need, the need to seed
The chance to die

Another dead don't cry, another dead don't cry
You've still got speed, you'll maybe bleed
But that's next time

Less time than before, more speed than before
You're rich not poor, what are you doing it for?
Want more, want more

Another dead don't cry, another dead don't cry
Indeed it's speed, to feed from speed
Doing it all the time

// Feeling Called Love //

What is this feeling called love?
What is this crazy scene I can't work out no how?
What is this feeling called love?
What is this crazy scene I can't understand no how?

Maybe I should try it now
Or maybe I should be shy of it now, now, now, now, now
'Cause there's nothing you know that can explain it
And there's nothing you know that's worth the pain of it

What is this feeling called love?
What is this crazy scene I can't work out no how?
What is this feeling called love?
What is this crazy scene I can't understand no how?

Gimme love
Gimme love
Gimme love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

// 1 2 X U //

Alright
Here it is, again
And it's called
1 2 X U

Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man yeah

Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Smoking a fag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man yeah

Got you in a corner, got you in a corner
Got you in a corner, got you in a corner
Got you in a cottage, got you in a corner
Got you in a corner, oh no no no

1 2 X U

// Dot Dash //

Mist closing in, getting thicker
One drops out, becoming quicker
Lights grow dim, they glimmer
The chances smaller, the odds are slimmer

Dot dash...
Dip flash...
Don't crash...

Loosening my grip
Be sure to tread carefully
Steering a passage
Finding a line

Cross to comply, crossply
Progressive acceleration, skidding but the expression
Remains pan, radiators for all
Radial, I'm still in control
I understand, a hand, a hand moved me

Dot dash...
Dip flash...
Don't crash...

Driven by self-propulsion
Turning right across the stream
The risks increased with sustained leisure
Courting death, so ill at...ease

Dot dash...
Dip flash...
Don't crash...

// Options R //

If you keep on repeating
Repeating a word
It becomes increasing
Increasingly absurd

So loving
I'm intending to
Pretending

I thought I was in
But now I'm trying to get out
I'm learning the twist
Ignoring the shouts

SO ADOR eye eyeing
I'm enquiring
Perspiring

My options are open
And it's up to me
Things are so trying
So trying for me

SO TIR eye eyeing
I'm spying something
SO TIR eye eyeing
I'm spying something
