Album: WithinTheRealmOfADyingSun

// Anywhere Out Of The World //

We scale the face of reason
To find at least one sign
That could reveal the true dimensions
Of life lest we forget

And maybe it's easier to withdraw from life
With all of it's misery and wretched lies
Away from harm

We lay by cool still waters
And gazed into the sun
And like the moth's great imperfection
Succumbed to her fatal charm

Any maybe it's me who dreams unrequited love
The victim of fools who watch and stand in line
Away from harm

In our vain pursuit
Of life for one's own end
Will this crooked path
Ever cease to end?

// In The Wake Of Adversity //

Hey, Patrice, don't cry
They've no reason to harm you at all
They don't realise
That the angels surround you with light

They don't understand
Their narrow ways defeat them where they stand
They don't realise
You hide your sadness beneath a painted smile

Ignorance
That light of fools steers a wayward path
And sets the course
Upon which we sail into the night of uncertainty

Following the stars
That make their way across the sky
Valuing the love
That lends grace to our hearts we sail

// Xavier //

Fair Roseanna
Your vagrancy's a familiar tale
Fraught with danger
The lives you led were judged profane

Hatred enfolds us
Inculcates the minds with its heresy
Laymen enfold us
Clemency arrive to set you free

Faith, although Xavier has prayed
That life-giving waters may rain
Down on the souls of men
To cure them of their ways

These were the sins of Xavier's past
Hung like jewels in the forest of veils
Deep in the heart where the mysteries emerge
Eve bears the stigma of original sin

Freedom's so hard
When we are all bound by laws
Etched in the scheme of nature's own hand
Unseen by all those who fail
In their pursuit of fate

Faith, although Xavier has prayed
That life-giving waters may rain
Down on the souls of man
To cure them of their ways

And as the night turns into day
Will the sun illuminate your way
Or will your nightmares come home to stay?
Xavier's love lies in chains

These were the sins of Xavier's past
Hung like jewels in the forest of veils
