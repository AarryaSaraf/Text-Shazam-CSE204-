// Eleusis //

Oh come calmly
Over the ocean I beckon to thee
I blow seeds of love to be
Born of my heart
Sown on the breeze

All I fondly know
Pales upon sails of your sweet gentle flow
How our love will grow
Crowned upon swans
Calling home

The love you hide inside
Has nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
I can see it in your eyes
Your empty hearts and your wasted lives

All I fondly know
Pales upon sails of your sweet gentle flow
How our love will grow
Crowned upon swans
Calling home

All I fondly know
Pales upon sails of your sweet gentle flow
How our love will grow
Crowned upon swans
Calling home

// Hymn For The Fallen //

My attends to you
As a mother hears
While her children sleep
Now look
See how they're dreaming
The black reciter reads
While the children sleep
Don't go so deep in slumber
Where you'll shy
Know you'll wander in sleep
Don't you fly too far away
Some men die without crying
Suffering so long and alone
Softly children dry your eyes
Gently children be wise
My attends to you
As a mother hears
All her children's fears
So don't cry
All will wash away
When we pray
Soon soon soon soon soon
So if it's okay I'll wait with you while
The sun began to shine
Oh look your wings are broken
But never a lie was spoken
The murdered thing is love you see
Drifting on a lake of memory
Now sleep close your eyes and have no fear
A wide blue sky is very near
My attends to you
As a mother hears
Her children's fears
Sleep

// Spirit //

I thought I'd found a reason to live
Just like before when I was a child
Only to find dreams made of sand
Would just fall apart and slip through my hands

But the spirit of life keeps us strong
And the spirit of life is the will to carry on

Adversity
What have I done to you
To cause this reclusive silence
That has come between me and you?

And the spirit of life remains in light
And the spirit of life remains inside, inside

I never thought it would be quite like this
Living outside of mutual bliss
But as long as the veins in our arm still stand up
The spirit of life will keep living on
