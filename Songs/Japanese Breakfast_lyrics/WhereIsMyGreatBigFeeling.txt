Album: WhereIsMyGreatBigFeeling

// Pure Handjob //

I thought I saw a hand glider
I wondered if it was tourist season
My body is so warm
Because my blood is flowing

We thought a nice place could bring us both luck
Things start to go our way
We thought a nice place could bring us both luck
Things start to go our way

Boys paint their boats by the water
Where is my great big feeling?
You bought a tai chi sword to practice
It flopped around like a thin limp dick

We thought a nice place could bring us both luck
Things start to go our way
We thought a nice place could bring us both luck
Things start to go our way
Where is my great big feeling?
Where is my great big feeling?
Where is my great big feeling to feel?

// My Mommy Is Sick //

Try not to get
So righteous
About what's fair
For everyone

Try not to think about my life without you
Try to channel every light in me to render this benign
Try not to think about my life without you
Try to channel every light in me to render this benign

// Name Your Sound //

Oh I guess it's going to be like this
Quiet from now on
Haven't I felt enough darkness?

And who if not you
Will wrap me up in a cotton towel
When I'm crying in the shower
Every morning?

You say that I'm old enough
I don't feel old enough
You beg me not to swell up with anger
Like I do, but I do, but I do

// FF69 //

Magic being
Mystic feelings
Final fantasy
Every morning

// Saturday Night 2046 //

PINA COLADA! PINA COLADA! PINA COLADA!
Baby
You don't need no
Reservations
With me

Baby
We don't need no
Reservations
We're going to Chilis

// Happier //

There's not much to show
Is there?
When you see it from far away
You don't have to make me proud
I just want you to be happy
Happy? Happy. Happy?
