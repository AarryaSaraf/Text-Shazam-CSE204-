// Diving Woman //

I wanna be a woman of regimen
A bride in her home state
A diving woman of Jeju-do

I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
I want it

The men have gone and left again
And no one's shocked or blames them
Another day is shot, my friend
I'm picking up the pieces
That's the third dead dog I've seen on this highway
These treads are wearing thin
When I get back there, baby
I'm gonna make you a home

You'll have it all
You'll have it all
You'll have it all
You'll have it all
I'll have it

// Road Head //

You gave road head on a turnpike exit
Going home, going home
Last ditch desperate, like a makeshift siphon
Pump and run, pump and run
Pump and run, pump and run

Run!

"Dream on, baby," were his last words to me
"Dream on, baby"
So dreaming baby took that corkscrewed highway
Lightless miles of big rigs
Lightless miles, miles and miles

Home

// Machinist //

I don't know how it happened
Was it always this way, and I just couldn't see it?
Heart burning hot enough for the both of us
I never realized how much you were holding back
All the times I felt so plugged in
You were tuning out
A muted channel, a cold ship, a hologram, an abyss

How can I fight a kingdom of your demons?
A mist, so palpable
You can't have it all
Her and all the pleasure
A woman can give

Do you trust me?
Can you feel it?
(Total control)
(Can't let go)
It could be bliss
(Machinist)

Can't speak
You wanted it all
Let go a piece of your heart
All the pleasure it gives
Leave me, lost in the night
Shadows go in and go by
I just wanted it all

Here's to the night
A lullaby a creepin'
A song to win your love
See me at all?
Through all of your aggressors
The true one

Can't speak
You wanted it all
Let go a piece of your heart
All the pleasure it gives
Leave me, lost in the night
Shadows go in and go by
I just wanted it all

// Soft Sounds From Another Planet //

I wish I could keep you from abusing yourself for no reason at all
Counting backwards, things you endured
Pitting them up against happier lives

That's not the way to hurt me
That's not the way to hurt me
I'll show you the way to hurt me

In search of a soft sound from another planet
In search of a quiet place to lay this to rest
Striving for goodness while the cruel men win
There's no part of me left that can feel or hear it

They'll never let you hurt me
They'll never let you hurt me
I'll never let you hurt me
(Hurt me)

// Boyish //

Your boyish reassurance is not reassuring
And I need it
And all of my devotion turns violent
If you go to her, don't expect to come home to me

I can't get you off my mind, I can't get you off in general
So here we are, we're just two losers
I want you and you want something more beautiful

Lack of inhibition works wonders in revealing every demon
And all this confrontation, this suffering
What do you want from me?
If you don't like how I look then leave

I can't get you off my mind, you can't get yours off the hostess
Watched her lips reserving tables
As my ugly mouth kept running

Love me
Love me!

// 12 Steps //

I said something cruel, I can't say I quite regret it
Twelve steps into the smoking bar, I found you
Clothes engulfed in a bonfire I begged you to my room
Begging still, all these years

Oh, looking back
How did I keep moving?
Didn't know that half of me was missing
It's easy to leave, easy to leave

So tell me, "I can't blame you, we let love run its course
And it's a little bit lonelier
I don't blame you, it's just our love ran its course
And that's a little bit hard"

Oh, looking back
Wasn't a thing to keep me
From running around in the wreckage that burned all season
It was easy to leave, when you'd finally seen me

Now tell me, "I can't blame you, it's just that love ran its course
And it's a little bit lonelier
I don't blame you, we let love run its course
And it's a little bit hard
I can't blame you, he's the one that you wanted
Singing scenes from a restaurant
I can't blame you, it's just our love ran its course
And it's a love that's long gone"

// Jimmy Fallon Big! //

We aren't bound by law
We aren't bound by anything at all
Just you
If you decide to show
Just if you decide to show up on time

Why walk when you can show up on time?
On time, on time

// The Body Is A Blade //

Try not to get so righteous
About whatâs fair for everyone
Find whatâs left in you
Channel something good

Try your best to slowly withdraw
From the darkest impulses of your heart
Try your best to feel and receive
Your body is blade that cuts a path from day to day

Calling it off, our hoax of trying
Whatâs this place if youâre not here?
Emptied the house and staged it for buying
Wave goodbye to all your things

Try your best to slowly withdraw
Try your best to slowly withdraw
Your body is a blade that moves while your brain is writhing
Knuckled under pain, you mourn but your blood is flowing

// Till Death //

All our celebrities keep dying
While the cruel men continue to win
You'd reassure me in a way you only can
Get these days to go by like the swaying of a ship

Your shape in the dark
Out of state, licensed to me
Public pool, Miller moon
Don't turn away, I'm still awake

Steering on hostile waves of panic
Like fighting a wheel that pulls to the right
I don't deserve you but I'm giving it my best
Extol your sacrifice with fine caviars and aspics

Your voice in the night
Sing me to sleep, soothe this insomnia
Haunted dreams, stages of grief
Repressed memories
Anger and bargaining

Your embrace, healing my wounds
Teach me to breathe, teach me to move
PTSD, anxiety, genetic disease
Thanatophobia

// This House //

This house is full of women
Playing guitar, cooking breakfast
Sharing trauma, doing dishes
And where are you?

What if one day I don't know you?
What if one day you leave?
And all confused desire and timezone changes
Change what's left of you and me?

Maybe it's all the drinks you're buying
I was feeling like a kid
Spying on hidden porn store cameras
Waiting on your graveyard shift

And now you're out in California
Just like you always said you'd be
And did you ever even love her?
Or was it rooted in companionship and timing?

Well I'm not the one I was then
My life was folded up in half
I guess I owe it to the timing of companions
I survived the year at all
