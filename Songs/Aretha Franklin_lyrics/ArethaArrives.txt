// Satisfaction //

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
And I try
I tell ya, I try
Believe me, I try
I sure enough try
But I can't get no
I can't get no
No

When I'm drivin' in my car
And a man comes on the radio
Tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
That's supposed to power my imagination
I can't get no
Oh, no-no-no
Hey, what I say, yeah
Aw, baby, that's what I say
Yes, it is
Hey-hey-hey
Aw, baby, that's what I say
Sure enough
I tell you that 
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
And I try
Baby, I try
Yeah, believe me I try
Sure enough try
But I can't get no
I can't get no
No

Well, I don't know what I can do
When I just can't do no more
Each thing new and different  I try
Seems to turn out to be one big bore
I can't get no
Oh, no-no-no
Hey, yeah-yay-hey
Oh, baby, that's what I say
Said I'm fed up
Hey-yeah-yeah
Oh, that's what I say
Yes, it is
I can't get me no satisfaction
All I need is some social reaction
Yeah, yeah
Ohh-ah-yeah
Hey, I can't get no satisfaction
I need social reaction
Yeah-yay
Ohh-ah-yeah

// You Are My Sunshine //

Oooh, they tell me that into each life
Some rain has sure got to fall
Oooh, they tell me here, that everybody
Has sure, has sure got to cry sometime (cry)
And, oh, if some rain (some rain)
If some rain has got to fall (some rain)
On everybody, and I've had enough rain in my life
Then I'm so glad right now
I got a little love around me
To keep the rain off my head, yeah, yeah
And I believe it's, I believe it's
I believe it's because (tell me what do you believe)
I believe it's because

On the other night, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you, I held you in my arms, yeah
But when I woke up and found out I was mistaken, yeah
You know that I hung my (you know that I hung my)
Hung my head and I cried (head and I cried)

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (baby)
You are my sunshine (baby)
You sure make me happy, baby, oh, when the skies are grey
And you'll never, never, never know, ah, how much I need you
I don't want you to take my (oh baby, don't you take my)
Take my sunshine away (shining away)

You told me once, you did it, that you really loved me
And no one else could ever, could ever come between, yeah
But now you're thinking about to leaving me (leaving)
For another, yeah (leaving)
If you do you know you're gonna shatter
Shatter every one of my dreams (all of my dreams)

Because, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby (baby)
You are my sunshine (baby)
You sure make me good and happy, oh, when the skies are grey
And you'll never, never, never know, ah, how much I need you (how much I really need you)
I don't want you to take my (oh, baby, don't you take my)
Baby, don't you take my (oh, baby, don't you take my)
You promised me (oh, baby, don't you take my)
That you'll never, never, never, never leave me
You promised me (sunshine, shown off)
That you'll never, never, never deceive me (sunshine, shown off)
Good God almighty, don't let him (sure enough)
Don't let him take it away (oh, baby, don't you take my)
Hey, baby, good God almighty (oh, baby, don't you take my)

// Never Let Me Go //

Just let me love you tonight
Forget about tomorrow
My darling won't
You hold me tight
And never let
Never let me go

Cry your eyes
No tears no sorrow
Cling to me
With all your might
And never let me go

A million times or more
We said we'd never never never never part
Ah but lately
Lately I find
That you're a stranger
A stranger in my heart
Give me give me give me

Give me the night
In summer or in springtime
To tell the world
That you're the you're and you're everything of mine
And you'll never
Oh never let me go
No
You'll never let me go

// 96 Tears //

Too many teardrops for one heart to be cryin' (I just can't stand it)
Too many teardrops for one heart to carry on, yest it is (I just can't stand it)
You're way on top now, baby, since you left me, yeah
And you're always laughin' down at me, yes sir

And we'll be together in just a little while, yes we will
And we'll be gathering tears from way up here, oh yeah

Oh oh, can you get a hundred, baby? yeah (can you make your tears one hundred?)
96 teardrops from you, ooo, ah, ooo, ah, ooo (can you get a million, baby?)
Get a million, yeah, yeah (96, it just won't do)

// Night Life //

In the evening, when the sun goes down
You're gonna find me, doin' 
what I'm doin' right now, and next just sitting around
The night life, it ain't no good life
But it's my life, yes it is

And all good people, good people, just like you and me
They're sitting around dreaming
Sitting around dreaming about that used to be
Well, the night life, ask anybody if that it ain't no good life
But that's alright because it's my life, oh, yes it is

Oh, listen to the blues, to the blues and what they're playing
I wonder tonight, are you really listening to the blues
To the blues and what they're saying
What they seem to be playing to me that's, that many people have loved
And they seem to be saying to me that many people have lost
Well, listen, they might not to have loved at all
If they had know that they couldn't pay the cost

Oh, they tell me, yeah, they tell me, yeah, they tell me, yeah, they tell me
They tell me that life is just an empty scene
They say that is older than the oldest broken hearts
And they tell me that is newer than the newest stood dreams
Well, the night life, what I'm doin' right now ain't no good life
But that's alright with me, because it's my life, yes it is
I tell you that the night life sure ain't no good life
Well, but it's my life, yes it is, yeah

// That's Life //

That's life, that's what all the people say.
You're riding high in April,
Shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune,
When I'm back on top, back on top in June.

I said that's life, and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks,
Stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down,
'Cause this fine ol' world it keeps spinning around

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate,
A poet, a pawn and a queen.
I've been up and down and over and out
And I know one thing:
Each time I find myself, flat on my face,
I pick myself up and get back in the race.

That's life
I tell ya, I can't deny it,
I thought of quitting baby,
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it.
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try,
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate,
A poet, a pawn and a king.
I've been up and down and over and out
And I know one thing:
Each time I find myself laying flat on my face,
I just pick myself up and get back in the race

That's life
That's life and I can't deny it
Many times I thought of cutting out 
But my heart won't buy it
But if there's nothing shakin' come this here july
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die
My, My

// I Wonder //

I wonder

I wonder my darling...
Where are you again tonight?
Are you holding someone else real tight?
Baby, I wonder...

My heart, my heart is aching
I believe that I'm a fool to let it go on breaking.
Maybe I wake up and find now that I'm mistaken
Oh but right now I wonder...

I've been through Lover's Lane
And I'm living life just the same
I've been travelling nowhere faced
And what I wanna know, what I wanna know is will it last?

Oh oh I wonder, I wonder my darling
Will you think of me? Will you think of me again tonight?

Or are you holding someone else real tight?
Oh yeah-he-he baby I wonder...

I've been through, I've been through Lover's Lane
And I'm livin' life, livin' it just the same
I've been travelling, been travelling nowhere faced
And what I wanna know right now, what I wanna know is will it last?

I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder my my my my my my my darling
Will you think of me? Will you think of me every day?
Although I may be a million miles away
Right now I wonder

Although I, although I may be a million miles away
Baby, baby, I wonder

// Ain't Nobody (Gonna Turn Me Around) //

Ain't nobody gonna turn me around no more
Ain't nobody gonna turn me around

Well I've learned my lesson and now I see
Love ain't the thing for me
Ain't nobody gonna turn me around
Turn me around, turn me around, turn me around

Ain't nobody gonna talk sweet talk to me
Ain't nobody gonna tell me how sweet your love can be
I'm gonna take my love and put in on the shelf
Ain't gonna give it to nobody else
Ain't nobody who's gonna turn me around
Turn me around, turn me around, turn me around

Love you've been so doggone mean
You shattered every one of my dreams
You know I can't love nobody else
But still you left me here all by myself

You turned me around
You turned me around
You turned me around
You turned me around
I learned my lesson and now I see
Love ain't the thing for me
Ain't nobody who's gonna turn me around
Turn me around, turn me around, turn me around

Love, you've been so doggone mean
Love, you shattered every one of my dreams
You turned me around, turn around
You turned me around, turn around

// Going Down Slow //

I have had my fun if I never get well no more
I have had my fun if I never get well no more
All of my health is failing
Lord, I'm going down slow

I'm going down slow
Please write my father and tell him the shape I'm in
Please write my father and tell him the shape I'm in
Tell her to pray for me
Forgive me for my sin
For all of my sin

On the next train south, look for my clothes back home
On the next train south, look for my clothes back home
'Cause all of my health is failing
Lord, I'm going down slow
I'm going down slow

All of my health is failing
Lord, I'm going down slow
I'm going down slow

Feel like I'm going, like I'm going down slow
I feel like I'm going, like I'm going down slow
I feel like I'm going, like I'm going down slow
I feel like I'm going, like I'm going down slow
I feel like I'm going, like I'm going down slow

// Baby, I Love You //

If you want my lovin'
If you really do
don't be afraid baby
Just ask me
You know I'm gonna give it to you
Oh and I do declare
I want to see you with it
Stretch out your arms little boy,
You're gonna get it
Cause I love you
ain't no doubt about it
Baby I love you,
I love you, I love you
I love you, baby I love you

If you feel you want to kiss me
Go right ahead I don't mind
All you got to do is
Snap your fingers and I'll come running
I ain't lying, I ain't lying
I heard you once little boy
You know you got it
I'd deny my own self
Before I see you without it
I love you
Ain't no doubt about it
Baby I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, baby I love you

Someday you might want to run away
And leave me sittin' here cryin'
But if it's all the same to you baby
I'm gonna stop you from sayin' goodbye
Baby I love you
Baby I need ya
Said I want ya
Got to have you baby
Don't let your neighbors
Tell you I don't want you
