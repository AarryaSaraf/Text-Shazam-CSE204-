// A Mother's Love //

I have seen a rainbow
Circle across the sky
And I have stood on a mountain
And watched an eagle fly

I have seen trees in a meadow
Shelter a morning dove
But I haven't seen anything
To match the wonder of a mother's love

I have seen a sunset
More beautiful than gold
And I have stood by a rosebed
And watched the leaves unfold

I have seen so many wonders
And blessings from above
But I haven't seen anything
To match the wonder of a mother's love

No, I still haven't seen anything
To match the wonder of a mother's love
