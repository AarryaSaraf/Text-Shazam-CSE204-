// How Glad I Am //

My love has no beginning, my love has no end,
No front no back, my love won't bend,
I'm in the middle, I'm lost in a spin
Loving you
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
How glad I am

My love has no bottom, my love has no top
My love won't rise, my love won't drop
I'm in the middle, and I can't stop
Loving you
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
How glad I am

I wish I was a poet, so that I could express,
What I, what I like to say,
I wish I was an artist, so that I could paint a picture
Of how I feel, how I feel today, today

My love has no walls on either side,
That makes my love wider than wide,
I'm in the middle, no and I can't hide,
Loving you
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know,
How glad I am
No you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know,
How glad I am
How glad I am
How glad I am

// Walk On By //

If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by, walk on by

Make believe 
That you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve 
In private 'cause each time I see you
I break down and cry 
And walk on by 
(Don't stop)
And walk on by
(Don't stop)
And walk on by 

I just can't get over losing you
And so if I seem broken and blue
Walk on by, walk on by

Foolish pride 
Is all that I have left
So let me hide 
The tears and the sadness you gave me 
When you said goodbye
Walk on by
And walk on by
And walk by 
(Don't stop)

Walk on by, walk on by
Foolish pride 
Is all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye
Walk on by 
(Don't stop)
And walk on by 
(Don't stop)
And walk by 
(Don't stop)

// I Can't Wait Until I See My Baby's Face //

I can't wait until I see my, my baby's face
When I tell him that I'm through
Yes, I'm through with him
'Cause he's been running round
And I got to, to put him down
I can't wait to see the look
The look in his eyes

I wonder if he'll cry 
When I tell him this is goodbye, yes it is
Or will he try to change my mind
And make me stay? yeah

Or will he turn around
And, with a smile on his face

Just walk away?
Just walk away

I can't wait until I see my, my baby's face
Gotta find out what I mean
What I mean to him
'Cause just one tear is all he's got to, to shed for me
And I know that l will run, yes I'll run to him
I'll hold him tight
Never, never let him go, no-o-o

And I can't wait until I see my, my baby's face
You know, I just can't wait until I see my baby's, baby's face 
You know, I just can't wait until I see my, my baby's face
I can't wait until I

// It's Just A Matter Of Time //

Someday, Someway You'll realize that you've been blind
Yes Darling, you're going to need me again
It's just a matter of time
Go on, go on Til you reach the end of the line
Cause I know you'll pass my way again
It's just a matter of time
After I gave you everything I had
You laughed and you called me a clown
Remember in your search for fortune and fame
What goes up must come down
I know, I know That one day you'll wake up and find
That my love is a true love
It's just a matter of time

Words are spoken with chords played
Someday and Someway
Girl you'll realize that you've been blind
Yes Darling, I know you gonna need me again
It's just a matter of time

After I gave you everything I had
You laughed and you called me a clown
But remember in your search for fortune and fame
What goes up must come down
I know, I know That one day you'll wake up and find
That my love was a true love
It's just a matter of time

// Runnin' Out Of Fools //

Sure you haven't got the wrong number
You sure its me you wanna talk to tonight?
Everyone in town's got your number
Everybody's got you pegged right

Is that why you got in touch with me?
I guess you must be runnin' out of fools

When you went and left me there crying
Your goodbye was even colder than ice
It didn't bother you I was crying
And now you wanna break my heart twice

Is that why you got in touch with me?
I guess you must be runnin' out of fools

Guess you got back (guess you got)
To my name
In your little black book

Well, listen
Tell you what (tell you what)
Bet you forgot (you forgot)
How I even look

So go ahead with all your sweet talking
Go ahead for all the good it can do
Have yourself a dime's worth of talking
And then I'm gonna hang right up on you

'Cause this time, you're not
You're not getting through to me
I guess you must be runnin' out of fools

Even fools like me
Even fools like me
I said you're running out of fools
Even old fools like me

// My Guy //

Nothing you could say could tear me away from my guy,
(My guy)
Nothing you could do 'cause I'm stuck like glue to my guy.
(My guy) 
I'm sticking to my guy like a stamp to a letter, 
Like birds of a feather we stick together, 
I'm tellin' you from the start I can't be torn apart from my guy.

Nothing you could do could make me untrue to my guy,
(My guy)
Nothing you could buy could make me tell a lie to my guy.
(My guy)
I gave my guy my word of honor to be faithful, and I'm gonna, 
You best be believing I won't be deceiving my guy.

As a matter of opinion I think he's tops,
My opinion is he's the cream of the crop;
As a matter of taste to be exact he's my ideal as a matter of fact.

No muscle-bound man could take my hand from my guy.
(My guy) 
No handsome face could ever take the place of my guy.
(My guy)
He may not be a movie star, but when it comes to bein' happy we are.
There's not a man today who could take me away from my guy.

No muscle-bound man could take my hand from my guy.
(My guy) 
No handsome face could ever take the place of my guy.
(My guy)
He may not be a movie star, but when it comes to bein' happy we are.
There's not a man today who could take me away from my guy.
(What you say, Tell me more)

No muscle-bound man could take my hand from my guy.
(My guy) 
No handsome face could ever take the place of my guy.
(My guy)
He may not be a movie star, but when it comes to bein' happy we are.

// Two Sides Of Love //

Two sides
Two sides of love can make me wonder
Can lift me up or pull me under
The different ways that you can be bother me

Cause there are sometimes
You treat me nice and whisper so sweetly
You make me feel youâre mine completely
And when you hold me like you do then I love you

But then there goes times
You smile at girls
Start me wonder if worth being fail and so down
You make me feel you donât want me around

Youâre making me a girl with two sides
One part of me can never, ever trust you
The other part keeps wanting just you
So if you find Iâm acting strange
Then youâre the one who made me change

Youâre making me a girl with two sides
One part of me can never trust you
The other part keeps wanting just you
So if you find Iâm acting strange
Then youâre the one who made me change, ah, ah

You took my love and you tore it all apart
Took my heart right from the start
Youâre making me a girl with two sides
Look at me, Iâve got two sides

// One Room Paradise //

I donât need no diamonds (she donât need)
And I donât need no money (she donât need, she donât)
Some people live in castles with sixty or seventy rooms (she donât)
Some people dream about a penthouse doll or a mansion on the moon
But I got me a little one room paradise and the man I love (and the man I love)
And thatâs all I need now
And the man I love (and the man I love)

Some girls are crazy about diamonds (diamonds)
Some go wild about perls (go wild)
Some girls go for a lot of loot from a check book that ainât hers (shoâ ainât hers)
But I got me a little one room to paradise and the man I love (and the man I love)
And thatâs all I need now
And the man I love (and the man I love)

Now, if one day he lucks up on a magic pot of gold (pot of gold)
I wouldnât mind a little diamond ring or a fur coat for the cold  (ooh)
But if it meant I had to lose just what Iâve got right now (right now)
Then I donât need no gold anyhow (no, no, oh)

I canât make love with no diamonds (diamonds)
Give them all to somebody else (anybody)
And what good is one hundred rooms if youâre debtor by yourself (yes, you)
So Iâll take me my little one room paradise and the man I love (and the man I love)
Well, thatâs all I need now
And the man I love (and the man I love)

I donât need no diamonds (she donât need no diamonds)
Said I donât need no money (she donât need no money, she donât)
