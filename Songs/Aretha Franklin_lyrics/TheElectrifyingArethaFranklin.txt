// I Told You So //

I hate to say, I told you so
Though you deserve it, because you know
You left me crying for someone new
But all the heartache came back to you
Now youâre begging me to take you back
I told you so, I told you so

When you were king and ridding high
You thought your new love would never die
While you were laughing, I cried alone
You wouldnât hear from me a bomb
Now youâre begging me to take you back
I told you so, I told you so

I think youâre so, I know you shouldâve reap
I told you so, I told you so
You are alone and look before you leap
I told you so, I told you so
You canât win when youâre a jumpinâ jack
I told you so, I told you so

I hate to say, I told you so
We lived in closely and said it slow
When you were leaving I told you then
Youâre needing ever come back again
So let me tell you with a last goodbye
I told you so, I told you so
So let me, let me tell you with a last goodbye
I told you so, I told you so

// Rock-A-Bye Your Baby With A Dixie Melody //

Rock-a-bye your baby with a Dixie melody. 
When you croon, croon a tune from the heart of Dixie. 
Just place my cradle, mammy mine, 
Right on the Mason Dixon line, 
And swing it from Virginia 
To Tennessee with all the love that's in ya. 

Weep no more, my lady. 

Sing that song again for me. 
Soft and low, just as though 
You had me on your knee. 

A million baby kisses I'd deliver, 
If you would only sing that Swanee River. 
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby with a Dixie melody

// Exactly Like You //

I know why I've waited
I know why I've been blue, yeah
'cause I've been waiting here for somebody, baby
Ah, yeah, exactly like you
Uh-huh

Why should we spend all of our money
On a show or two
When nobody makes those love scenes, honey
Ah, exactly like you

Now you make me feel so grand
I want to give this world to you
And you make me understand
These foolish little dreams I'm dreamin'
And schemes I'm schemin', yeah

I know why my daddy
Taught me to be true, yeah
'cause he was keepin' me here for somebody, somebody, somebody
Exactly like you

Now you make me feel so grand
I want to hand this great big wide world to you
And you make me understand
These foolish little dreams I'm dreamin'
And oh, schemes I'm schemin', yeah

I know why my daddy
The man taught me to be true, uh-huh
'cause he was savin' me here for somebody, somebody, somebody
Exactly like you
Oh, exactly, ah baby
Like you.
Exactly like you
Nobody, nobody, nobody but you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Exactly, exactly, exactly, oh, like you
Oh baby
Somebody, somebody...

// It's So Heartbreakin' //

Itâs so heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else
When somebody youâve been dreaming of
Is in love with somebody else
You canât keep on smiling over rainyâs due
Keep on walking though youâve gotta hold in your shoe
But itâs so heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else

John thought Jennie really love him true
Till he caught her kissing with Bill
John is so lonesome, donât know what heâll do
Since Jane went over the hills
So there goes Johnnie with a broken heart
He is just too good for nothing since theyâre apart
Cause itâs so heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else

Oh, itâs so heartbreaking when youâre love is gone
And your dream love go up in smoke
And itâs so frightening, baby, when you love someone
And he thinks your love is a joke
Oh, you gotta keep on living till the day you die
But youâre so disgusted that you wonder why
Cause itâs so heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else

I said that itâs so heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else
It hurts so bad, yes it does
So heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else
That man really turn just back on
So heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else

// Rough Lover //

Now, listen here, girls
Iâm gonna tell you
What I want right now

I want a rough lover
I want a man
I want a rough, tough lover
And Iâll find him if I can

Heâs got to bite nails
Fight bears
And if I get sassy
Be a man who dares
To shut me up and kiss me
So I know he cares
I want a man

Donât want a mean daddy
I want a boss
I want a mean, sweet daddy
Who the devil wouldnât cross

Heâs got to spit fire
Chew iron
Get mad and start roaring
Like a mountain lion
Then whisper that he loves me
So I know heâs mine
I want a man

Iâm looking for a guy
Whoâs big and strong
But weak for me
Iâm looking for a guy
Whoâll ride around
But never, never set me free

I want a rough lover
I want a man
I want a rough, tough lover
With a sentimental plan

So he can kiss nice
Hug tight
Heâs gotta be sweet and gentle
Day and night
But mean enough to make me
Want to treat him right
I want a man, oh, yeah

Iâm looking for a guy
Whoâs raving strong
But weak for me
Iâm looking for a guy
Whoâll ride around
But never, never set me free

I want a rough lover
I want a man
I want a rough, tough lover
With a sentimental plan

So he can kiss nice
Hug tight
Heâs gotta be sweet and gentle
Day and night
But mean enough to make me
Want to treat him right
I want a man

I want a man
I donât want no creampuff, baby
Donât want no butterfly
I want a man

Oh, yes, I do
Oh, yes, I do

// Blue Holiday //

It's been a blue holiday since you've been gone
Oh my darling, won't you hurry, hurry home
It's been a blue holiday I'm all alone
You know I, I need your love to keep me warm
I cry when I hear the chapel bells ring
And sometimes I cry all through the night
Please oh please come, come back to me
And make my holiday bright
It's been a blue holiday my heart's in pain
My dear, I pray to have your love again

Blue blue blue blue blue holiday my heart's in pain
My dear, I pray to have your love again
I pray to have your love again
It's been a blue blue holiday

// Just For You //

Iâll say goodbye to all that old friends
Just for you, just for you
If we can be together, just we two

Iâll stay at home all week and weekends
If youâll be there with me
Our lust will be a drift, you just wait and see

Iâll forget the old days
When running around was fun
Through the years and always
Youâll be the only one

Iâll save my love and my affection
Just for you, Iâll be true
As long as I may live, Iâll live just for you

// That Lucky Old Sun //

Up in the mornin', out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day

Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day
Dear Lord above, can't you know I'm pining, tears all in my eyes

Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to paradise
Show me that river, take me across, wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day, but roll around heaven all day

Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to paradise
Show me that river, take me across, wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day

// I Surrender, Dear //

We played the game of stay away
But it cost more than I can pay
Without you I canât make my way
I surrender, dear

Now, I may seem proud, I may act gay
But itâs just a pose, oh, Iâm not that way
Cause deep down, deep down in my heart, I say
I surrender, dear

Mmm, little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game
Lending a spice to the wooing
Oh, but I donât care whoâs to blame, blame

When stars appear and shadows fall
Why then youâll hear my poor heart call?
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear

Oh, I, I surrender, dear
Oh, yeah, yeah, I
Oh, I surrender, yeah, dear, yeah, yeah

// Hard Times (No One Knows Better Than I) //

They call it hard times yeah yeah
Oh, oh yeah yeah, hmm
Oh one more time yeah
One more, one more, one more time yeah, oh hmm yeah
[?] said it was high time that I feel alright
You know yeah yeah yeah

// When They Ask About You //

When I go for a walk
And meet old friends we knew
We sit around and talk
Then they ask about you
What's the good if I say
That you and I are through 
I should tell them you're okay
When they ask about you

They wonder where we've been
And why we fail to call
And I take it on the chin
Until the teardrops fall
They 
They 
They 
Don't mean to be smart
But if they only knew
They're stepping on my heart
When they ask about you
They're stepping on my heart
When they ask about you

// Operation Heartbreak //

Operation heartbreak
You took your love from me
And for the rest of my life there will always be
A wound that will never heal, oh, oh, oh

With all I have to give why must I sit and suffer?
Operation (operation, oh)
Heartbreak (operation, uh)
Why did you take your love from me? 
(Why did you take your love from me?)

Operation (operation, oh)
Heartbreak (operation, uh)
How will I ever survive? Yeah (survive)
For you have made a score deep down inside of me
Without your love I can't stay alive, oh yeah (stay alive)

With all I have to give why must I sit and suffer? Yeah, yeah, yeah
Operation (operation, oh)
Heartbreak (operation, uh)
Why did you take your love from me? (operation, uh)

A wound that will never heal, oh, oh, oh
