// Won't Be Long //

Baby, here I am
By the railroad tracks
Waiting for my baby
'Cause he's coming back
Coming back to me
On the 503
And it won't be long
No, it won't be long

I've been so lonesome
Since the man has been gone
There ain't a thing worth mentioning
Nothin' been going on

And that's why I know
When the whistle blows
Yeah, that it won't be long
No, no, it won't be long

My daddy told me
When he said goodbye
Yes, he did
"I'll be back, baby
Baby, by and by,"

And that's why I waited
So doggone long, yeah
Can't you see how happy I am?
Because the man is coming home

So now, here I be
By the railroad tracks
Oh, waiting for my baby
He's coming back
Coming back to me
On the 503
Yeah, and it won't be long
No, no, it won't be long

I ain't had no loving
Since you know when
He's a long-gone rooster
And I'm a lonesome hen

And that's why I'm sure
When the whistle blows
Yeah, that it won't be long
No, no, it won't be long

Mmm, and I'm so excited
My knees are shaking, yeah
Mr. Engineer
Don't you keep me waiting!
You hear me?
Telling you:
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

Baby, here I am
Oh, by the railroad tracks
Waiting for my baby
He's coming back

Coming back to me
Lord, on the 503
Yeah, and it won't be long
No, it won't be long

Ahh, yeah, I know
When the whistle blows
Hey, that it won't be long
No, no, it won't be long
I don't know about you, but
I know, yeah, I know
That it won't be long
No, no, it won't be long
Said it won't be long
No, it won't be long...

// Over The Rainbow //

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dream you dare to dream
Really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh
Why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly
beyond the rainbow
Why, oh Why can't I?

// Love Is The Only Thing //

I love and you love
We love
Sweet love
I look and you look
And we found sweet love
And now we know
Love is the only thing
That matters at all
After all

I kiss and you kiss
Each kiss sweet lips
I tease and you squeeze
And we find sweet bliss
That's how we know
Love is the only thing
That matters at all
After all

I'm lucky
And you're lucky too
We're lucky
And we know it's true
Love is so wonderful

I give and you give
We live for love
Each night
Each day
We love sweet love
Cause ain't it so?
Love is the only thing
That matters at all
After all

Love is the only thing
That matters at all
After all

// Who Needs You? //

If you ever need me
You know where to call me
And if you ever want me
You know where to write me
But you never call me
And no, you never write me
So, who needs you?
Who needs you?

Take a pen, a pencil
A hand, a little item
Or the telephone, dear
Why you want to fight'em
How much can it cost you
Why don't you get lost, dear?
Who needs you?
Who needs you?

You came on like a big deal
And all that you could beg me
Listen Mister Big Wheel
All you do is drag me

When I really need you
You just can't be found, dear
And when I really want you
You're nowhere around, dear
So, all this big production
Leads to one deduction
Who needs you?
Who needs you?

You came on like a big deal
And all that you could beg me
But listen Mister Big Wheel
All you do is drag me

When I really need you
You just can't be found, dear
And when I really want you
You're nowhere around, dear
So, all this big production
Just leads to one deduction
Who needs you?
Who needs you now?
Who needs you?
Who needs you now?
Who needs you?
Who needs you?

// Right Now //

Tell me if you love me
Right now
Tell me if you want me
Right now
You make me think you like it
When we kiss
But still you never say so

So if you're only playing
LetÂ´s stop
Cause you're nearly blowing my top
And if you can say you do
But if you don't
Baby tell me right now

You've got a smile I love
And you've a style I love
And your caress
Is all my heart is dreaming of

But if you keep stalling
By the time we click
I'll be turning gray
And you'll be walking
With this trick

So if we're gonna make it
Let's start
Cause you're overworking my heart
I confess that I'm with you
And you with me
But tell me right now

You've got
You've got a smile I love
And God knows you've the style I love
And your caress
Is all my heart is dreaming of

But if you keep stalling
By the time we click
I'll be turning gray
And you'll be walking
With this trick

So if we're gonna make it
We've got to start
Cause you're overworking my heart
And you're the guy that I love
That I can't deny
And all you ever give me
Is just an alibi
And baby I've decided
Now it's do or die
So tell me if you love me
Oh tell me if you love me
I wanna know now
I wanna know now
Yes right now
Hmmm

// Are You Sure //

Are you sure your prayers
Haven't been answered?
Now, think
Sister, think

Are you sure your prayers
Haven't been answered?
Now, think
Brother, think

But don't you dare
Say the good Lord
Didn't stop to hear you
He hears and sees
Everything you do
Stop right now
And take the inventory
You'll come up
With a different story

Because He sees
Every move you make
Every wiggle of you head
Every wink of your eye
He sees
The laugh you're laughing
And hears tears you cry

You may not know
How to pray
But He loves you
When you try
So raise your voices high
And the Lord will hear you
Hear you

He sees every move you make
Every wiggle of you head
Every wink of your eye
He sees
The laugh you're laughing
And hears tears you cry

You may not know
How to pray
But He loves you
When you try
So raise your voices high
And the Lord will hear you
Hear you

Are you sure
You haven't been answered?
Now think
You'd better think

Are you sure
Real sure
You haven't been answered?
Now think
Brother, think

Don't you dare
Say the good Lord
Didn't stop to hear you
He hears and sees
Everything you do
Stop right now
And take the inventory
You'll come up
With a different story

Because He sees
Every move you make
Every wiggle of you head
Every wink of your eye
He sees
The laugh you're laughing
And hears tears you cry

You may not know
How to pray
But He loves you
When you try
So raise your voices high
And the Lord will hear you
Hear you

Oh! Raise your voices high
And the Lord will hear you
Hear you

Oh! Raise your voices high
And the Lord will hear you

// It Ain't Necessarily So //

It ain't necessarily so
It ain't necessarily so
The things that you're liable
To read in the Bible
It ain't necessarily so

Now David was small but, oh my
Yes, David was small but, oh my
He fought big Goliath
Who lay, lay down and dieth
Yes, David was small
But, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa my

You've ever heard 'bout Jonah?
He lived in a whale
You've ever heard 'bout Jonah?
He lived, lived in a whale
And he made his home in that fish's abdomen
Yes Jonah, he lived in a whale

To get into heaven
Don't snap for a seven
Live clean and don't have no fault
And take me, yeah, take that gospel
Whenever it's possible
But with a little grain of salt

Methuselah lived 900 years
Methuselah lived 9,900 years
But tell me who, who calls that living
When no gal is given to no man
What's 900 years?

That's why I say that it ain't
It ain't necessarily
It ain't, no, necessarily
It ain't, it ain't necessarily so

Ain't necessarily so
Ain't necessarily so
Ain't necessarily
Ain't necessarily
Ain't necessarily

// (Blue) By Myself //

Feeling mighty blue
By myself
One ol' lonesome shoe
By myself
Now that love's behind me
You'll find me
By myself

I just sit and stare
At the floor
Just don't seem to care
Anymore
Since my baby's gone
Got a padlock on my door

That old black cat
Keeps hangin' 'round
But I ain't blaming him
'Cause things are bad
It ain't his fault
I've gone and lost
The only love
I ever had

Love
Love
I miss him so
It's no lie
And I'm so "double o"
I could die
So I'll be
Just me here
By myself
