// Maybe I'm A Fool //

Maybe I'm a fool
For loving you so
And maybe
Maybe I'm a fool
I don't, I don't really know
But I can't
I can't stop loving you
Darling, oh yes
Though I tried, oh yes

And maybe
Maybe your goodbye was so mean
So mean and unfair
Though you made me cry
My love's still there
And I know, I know
That I'll long for your kisses, oh
Until I die
Oh yes, until I die

Well, I said all of my friends
All of my friends have told me
They said
"Aretha, why don't you find
You really need to find
Somebody new"
Yeah, oooh yeah
But what they don't know
What they just don't know
Is in my heart
I'd missing, oh
That that someone was you

So, oh, it's all for you to decide
If you should decide
To trap me once more
All you got to do
All you got to do is knock on my door
And I'll say
I'll say that I've taken you back

Yeah, taking you back would be folish
Then maybe, oh, maybe I'm a fool
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

// Today I Sing The Blues //

Without a word of warnin'
The blues walked in this mornin'
And circled around my lonely room.

I didn't know why I had that sad 'n lonely feelin'
Until my baby called and said we were through, hooo.

For yesterday this time I sang a lovesong
But today... I'm singing the blues.

Now, I know the explanation
But to me that's no consolation
No, no, it just goes to show you
No matter how you love, everybody has got to lose
And since I've lost, I'd rather walk around and woe
I guess I just walk the darkest avenue

For yesterday this time I sang a lovesong
But today... I'm singing the blues.

Now, it strikes me kinda funny how love can be this way
'Cause we were lovin' 'til last night honey, yeah.
I'm alone again today

And it strikes me kinda funny how fate can be so unfair
'Cos I seem to come right on the losin' end in every, every love affair!

Yes it must be, it must be meant for me that I should be the one,
Be the one to always lose, hooo.

For yesterday this time I sang a lovesong
But right now... I'm singing the blues.

// I Wonder (Where Are You Tonight) //

Where are you tonight?
Are you lonely like I am, tonight?
Have we lied to each other about this affair?
If so, don't make me suffer, just tell me you still care

Have you cried tears like I have at all?
And do you wonder as I do, should I call?
I'll hurt for a lifetime not knowing my fate
Is there still any hope here or am I too late?

I wonder, I wonder
Where are you tonight?
Are you painting the town while I just sit around?
It's so wrong when you know our love is so right

Have you cried tears like I have at all?
And do you wonder as I do, should I call?
I'll hurt for a lifetime not knowing my fate
Is there still any hope here or am I too late?

I wonder, I wonder
Where are you tonight?
I wonder, I wonder
Where are you tonight?

// Muddy Water //

Baby weâve got to have us a little talk
Gonna have to pack up my things Iâm gonna walk
You say a dollar goes from hand to hand
But before I see you go from woman to woman
Iâd rather drink muddy water
Sleep out in a hollow log, yes I would

I love you baby but you just wonât be fair
I donât believe you know how to be on the square
Now go on and have your fun and if you must
But before I have another man that I cannot trust
Iâd rather drink muddy water
Sleep out in a hollow log, yeah

You promised me you were gonna live by the golden rule
I work all day and walk just like a fool
For you my kisses are sweet as they can be
But before I see you make a stone fool out of me
Iâd rather drink muddy water
Yes Iâd rather drink muddy water
Iâd rather drink muddy water
Oh yes I would

Iâd rather drink muddy water
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes I would
Show me the way, way, way, way, way down
To that place I can find that muddy water
Iâll go ahead and turn it on up
I say Iâd rather drink muddy water
Iâd rather drink muddy, muddy, muddy water
Sleep out in a hollow log

// Without The One You Love //

Baby, I need your good lovin'
Got to have your love right now, baby
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile

Because I'm not livin', baby, I only exist
I'll never laugh, I'll never smile no more
Don't care if I stay like this, because

Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love, my dear, I'm like a fatherless child
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile

When I feel the hurt comin' on
I stop and cry like I'm cryin'
(Right now)
People ask why would a grown man cry
I drop my head and I sigh and reply

Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love, my dear, I'm like a fatherless child
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile

(Baby, I need your good lovin')
Sometimes I feel like a wanderer
(Got to have your love right now)
Searching for peace within

(Baby, I need your good lovin')
I need you my darling
(Got to have your love right now)
Like a lost soul needs a friend

So come and fill my empty arms
And fill my empty life

(Baby, I need your good lovin')
Nobody knows the emptiness I feel
(Got to have your love right now)
And I feel it

(Baby, I need your good lovin')
Nobody knows the loneliness I feel
(Got to have your love right now)
And I feel it because

Without the one you love, life is not worthwhile
Without your love, my dear, I'm like a fatherless child
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile

// Trouble In Mind //

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday

I'm going down to the river
I'm going top take me a rocking chair
And if the blues don't leave me, I rock on away from here

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday

Trouble in mind, that's true
I have almost lost my mind
Life ain't worth living, I feel like I could die

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
My poor heart is healing slow
I've never had such trouble in my whole life before

I'm gonna lay my head on some lonesome railroad line
And let that 2:19 special ease my troubled mind

Trouble in mind, I'm blue,
But I won't be blue always
'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday

// Take A Look //

Take a look in the mirror, look at yourself
But don't you look too close
'Cause you just might see
The person that you hate the most

Lord, what's happenin' to this human race?
I can't even see one friendly face
Brothers fight brothers and sisters wink their eyes
While silver tongues bear fruits of poison lies

Just take a look at your children born innocent
Every boy and every girl
Denyin' themselves a real chance
To build a better world

Dear Lord, dear Lord, what's happenin' to your precious dream?
It's washin' away on a bloody bloody stream
Take a look at your children before it's too late
And tell them nobody wins when the prize is hate
