Album: Yeah

// This Could Be The Start Of Something //

You're walking along the street or you're at a party
Or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig
You're looking in someone's eyes and suddenly realize
This could be the start of something big
You're lunching at twenty-one's and watching your diet
Declining a Charlotte Russe, accepting a fig
When out of the clear blue sky, suddenly it's gal and guy
And this could be the start of something big

There's no controlling the unrolling of your fate, my friend
Who knows what's written in the magic book
But when a lover you discover at the gate, my friend
Let him in without a second look

You're up in an aeroplane or dining at Sardi's
Or else at Malibu alone on the sand
Suddenly hear a bell, suddenly you can tell
This could be the start of something
This could be the start of something
This could be the start of something big
Oh, this could be the start of something big

// Once In A Lifetime //

Just once in a lifetime
A woman knows a moment
One wonderful moment
When fate takes her hand
And this is my moment
My once in a lifetime
When I can explore a new and exciting land
Just once in my lifetime
I feel like a giant
And I soar like an eagle
As though I had wings
For this is my moment
My destiny calls me
And though it may be just once in a lifetime
I'm gonna do great things

Just once, once in my lifetime
Ooh, I feel like a giant
And I soar like an eagle
Just as though I had wings
For this, this is my moment
My destiny calls me
And though it may be just once in my lifetime
I'm gonna do great things
I'm gonna do real things
I'm gonna do real big things
Real, big, things

// Misty //

Ooh look, just look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
Why I get misty, holding your hand
Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or is it the sound of your hello dear
That music I hear
Ooh, why I get misty whenever you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just, just what I want you to do
Can I help it, how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

And on my own, said on my very own
Woo, that I wander through this great big wide world all alone
Never knowing my right hand from my left
My hat from my glove
Ooh, I'm too misty, too much in love
Ooh, I say I'm just too misty
Very, very, very much in love

// More //

More than the greatest love the world has known
This is the love I give to you alone
More than the simple things that I try to say
I only live to love you more each day
More than you'll ever know
My arms long to hold you so
My life is in your keeping
Laughing, sleeping, crying, weeping
Longer than always is a long time
But far beyond forever you'll be mine
I know I've never lived before
But my heart is very sure
No one else could love you more

More than the simple things that I try to say
I only live to love you more each day
More than you'll ever know
My arms long to hold you so
My life is in your keeping
Laughing, sleeping, crying, weeping
Longer than always is a long time
But far beyond forever you'd be mine
I know I've never lived before
But my heart is very sure
No one else could, no one else could love you
No one else could, no one else could love you more
No one else could love you more
No one else could love you, love you more
No one else could love you more, no no
No one else could love you, no no
No one else could love you, no no
Now that's a fade

// There Is No Greater Love //

There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love
No heart so true
There is no greater thrill
Than just what you bring to me
No, no sweeter song
Than what you sing, sing to me

You're, you're the sweetest thing
That I, I have ever known, mhm
And to think, just to think that
You are mine, you are mine alone

There is, there is no greater love
In all the world, in all the world, it's true, ooh hoo
No greater love
Than just what I feel for you

You're, you're the sweetest thing
That I have ever, ever known
And to think that you are mine
You're mine all alone, all alone

There is no, no greater love
In all the world, all the world, and it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel, what I feel for you
Ooh hoo, yeah, no greater love
Than just what I feel for you, ooh hoo
For you

// If I Had A Hammer //

If I had a hammer
I'd swing it in the morning
Swing it in the evening
All over this land
I'd swing out a warning
Then swing out danger
And the love I have for my brothers and sisters
All over this land, ooh yeah

If I had a bell
Well, I'd ring that bell in the morning
I'd ring it in the evening
All over this land
I'd ring out danger
Then sing out a warning
And the love that I have for my brothers and sisters
All, all over this land, yes, I will

If I had a song
I'd sing it in the morning
Sing it in the evening
All over this land
See me hammer out my justice
See me ring out my warning
And the love that I have for my brothers and sisters
All over this land, yes, I would

All over this land, woo, yes, I would
All over this land, ooh hoo hoo, yes, I would
All over this land
All over this land
All over this land

// Impossible //

If they had ever
Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever told me
If they had ever, ever told me how sweet a kiss could be
I would have said impossible, impossible for me
And if they said that I'd find you beyond the rainbow's end
I would have said it's impossible, impossible, my friend

To dream about what might have been is strange enough for me
But now it seems that I'm living in a dream too beautiful to be

And if they'd said that I'd find you beside a stormy sea
I would have said it's impossible for now I, I see
That nothing is impossible if you are here with me

// Today I Love Ev'rybody //

I think the sky is blue
Just as far as I can see
But should you say the sky is gray
Well, it still looks blue to me
I know the road is light
And I've known this all along
But should you say the sky is gray
Then I won't say that you're wrong

Because today, I love everybody
Everybody I see
Today, I think that all folks are great and
Everybody here loves me
Ooh, today, I'd give almost anybody
Anything that I've got
Today, I'd state all folks are great
Including them that are not

Well, if joy can be contagious
Why not catch this real outrageous thing
This glorious thing
This marvelous thing

Oh, today, I'd give anybody
Anything that you see
And today, I think that all folks great and
Everybody here loves me

Well, if joy can be contagious
Why not catch this real outrageous thing
This, this glorious thing
This marvelous thing

Oh, today, I'd give anybody
Anything that you see
And today, I think that all folks are great and
And everybody here loves
Everybody here loves
Everybody here loves me
