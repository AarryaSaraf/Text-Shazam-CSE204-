// #STUCK //

Sick of being stuck in the house
I wanna go out now
I wanna get out now
We should go out now
Because I'm sick of being stuck in the house
I wanna go out now
I wanna get out now
We should go out now

Now is the time I been losing my mind
I wanna see what's going on outside
I need some love and my hair done
I need some love, could you spare some
I don't wanna be trapped inside anymore
What is there to do when you're just so freakin' bored
So won't you let me out this hellhole
Inside of here I hear an echo
Seems like I may never be free
I wish you were with me

I wanna get some fresh air
Whack shop clothes, someone gotta use there
Do you feel me out there?
Can you hear me out there?
I wanna get some fresh air
Whack shop clothes, someone gotta use there
Do you feel me out there?
Can you hear me out there?

Sick of being stuck in the house
I wanna go out now
I wanna get out now
We should go out now
Because I'm sick of being stuck in the house
I wanna go out now
I wanna get out now
We should go out now

// 07/14/19 Freestyle //

Yo I was going to take a sip
But I ain't even thirsty
It's summer time, man my own son/sun tried to burn me
Niggas acting brand new jersey
Put a nigga in surgery, if he tryna curb me
You prolly don't get it
That just shows you ain't worthy, that's unworthy...
You a die off of Power Charlie Murphy
My own blood hating on me and that shit hurts me
Raised since a have not, Lord have mercy
Tryna get a Miller like Percy
That was weak, but if it's beef, we can meet/meat like turkey
Sis call 12 now Bobby on 12:30, laid out
You wearing coach shoes like they ain't played out
Your man kicked you out, girl, you should've stayed out
What's a challenge to a champion?
Staying my ground like I'm Anakin
You want to be a real man but you're just a mannequin
Panicky man vanishing sweet like mandarin
Speaking in Mandarin calling for help but nobody's answering
Blessed cause I "Woke up this morning...", Anthony Hamilton
Yo, they hate to hear a girl rap, quick to say that girl wack
Who the hottest in the world? It's tha girl Whack
Your girl back, I'm a Grammy nominee
On the road to success I been tryna find the key
Millionaire in a year is what I'm tryna be
"Ay girl you so fly!" they like "Why Emcee?"
In a YMCA and I'm listening to me
(Peace)

// 76 //

Yeah

Been winnin', just ask Ben Simmons
Practice from start to finish
Doc Rivers, layin' up with winners
Embiid, big stepper stampede
Team player like Tyrese Maxey
I get all up in your face like acne
Tobias comin' for the top spot
I'm flyin', tryna beat the shot clock
Shake Milton makes millions
Hard ball, no loss, no feelings
Got green, three rings like Danny
I ball hard for my family

Ain't nothin' but a rebound
Ain't nothin' but a re-
Ain't nothin' but a rebound
Ain't nothin' but a re-
Sorry, gotta ball on ya

Every time I call on ya

Stay down, just trust the process
Been makin' lots of progress
Championship, we comin'
We go and get it, we want it
Assist, yeah, you gotta be swift
You ain't ever seen 'em do it like this
Do a hunnid on seventy-six
Seventy-six
Seventy six
And the crowd goes nuts
And the crowd goes nuts
And the crowd goes nuts

Tic Toc
Tic toc
Kicked Up

I was thirteen
I was working, tryna get my hands on the first ding-a-ling
I was lurking
We were flirting
Babyboy oum can you be my king king
Kicked up, I been watchin' you (watchin')
Tic toc, boy it's time to prove
Boy I felt so alone, I just wanna get you home
Baby don't you wanna hear me moan
I don't mean to rush it, you can be my suspect
My cover can be blown
Traveling your timeline
Following your guidelines
Time is running out
I don't want you in this drought

He said I ain't waterproof
I ain't sick but I want your soup
And he said rain on me
He said Whack I ain't lyin
Girls like you are hard to find
He said rain on me, yeah

Waiting (tic toc, stop)
Clock keeps ticking
Cause it's you that I've been missing

For the right time (tic toc, stop)

What is a girl supposed to do
When her hormones keep on yelling at you
I tell you the truth
Cause still you tell me to prove the point
I think I need to find better to do
I fell in the booth
It's unevitable
You tell me to choose and then you put a tack on my shoe
Forever confused
Never turn my back on ya boo
You ride with your crew and then I ride with my dude
I never thought this day would come (yo, yo)
I remmeber we were young (yo, yo)
It's the vision, we must complete our mission
In this love crime baby I play the victim, I miss him
That's what I reply when they listen
Question
Why I still love you from a distance?
Difference, I was just [?] when I wonder where we are
Then I wonder where you at
Where you at?

He said I ain't waterproof
I ain't sick but I want your soup
And he said rain on me (rain on me)
He said Whack I ain't lyin
Girls like you are hard to find
He said rain on me, yeah (rain on me, yeah)

Clock keeps ticking
Cause it's you that I've been missing

I like nice things
Buy me nice things
Give me compliments
Please have common sense

Open the door, tell 'em that you ready to explore
Yeah, Aventador, yeah, I had to chalk him, I got bored
I need support, like a sports bra, bae, I need support
I say less is best but I need more
Shoulda took me shoppin' to the store

I can't fuck with you no more
When I go to sleep Gucci sheets now
Goin' out to eat, don't eat no meat now
Yeah, we from the streets, you get a beat down
Skin tanned 'cause we livin' on the beach now
Shinin' like a diamond, fine dinin'
Forty thousand, turn that shit to fifty thousand
Bitch, I'm wildin', stranded on a island
Money pilin', Rolex 'cause I put that time in
Put the time in

Yeah, open the door, tell 'em you got money but need more
Yeah, in a Porsche, call me a gold digger, yes, of course
I'm in Dior, I think I just might buy me a horse
Basketball game, we on the floor, I need me new bags just to adore

I can't fuck with you no more
When I go to sleep Gucci sheets now
Goin' out to eat, don't eat no meat now
Yeah, we from the streets, you get a beat down

Pull up in a tank, ready for war
Thank the Lord, got my passport, take me on tour
Tryna ride the wave, now all aboard
Champagne for the pain, can you pour?

You got me fucked up
You got me fucked up
You got me fucked up
You got me fucked up

// Feel Good //

Why would I lie
And say I feel good
When I don't feel good?
All I really want is to be happy
And truly... feel good!
I got everybody looking at me
Like why she don't feel good?
I done seen the stars
I done seen the lights
But I can't forget that I'm still hood
Fake smiles never had me sold
Even in the summer my heart cold
Whack why you always be so bold?
Holidays just keep gettin' old...

(Holidays just keep gettin' old...)

Who can I look up to?
When I'm feeling down
Just me and not you
Don't want you around
It goes happy this
It goes happy that
But somehow I cant seem to find happy whack?
Where did she go?

(Holidays just keep gettin' old...)

// Gloria //

Hold on
I've been gone too long, I think it's time I get back
Put a nigga in a box like a Big Mac
Man, they love me in the hood
They say, "Big Whack, Big Whack, Big Whack, Big Whack"
What's up?
Why you wanna see me down? You should give up
I've been callin' on my niggas just to lift up
Think I want me a new Lamb', the doors
Lift up, lift up, lift up, lift up

Swear that I work the hardest
Most of y'all dudes are garbage

Don't mean to be rude
Stepping on your shoes

Why they want me dead?

My feet don't touch the floor, mmm
Hit 'em with the new flow
Love the way my skin glow, yeah

About me, about me

Used to be like P.B. (Help me, please)

Sick of this, hard to stomach, now that nigga shittin' bricks

All men should be feminists, Donald Trump fucks immigrants

// Peppers And Onions //

You got to be the one the people lookin' up to
I tried to reach the sun but gum is stuck to my shoes
You got to be the one the people lookin' up to
I tried to reach the sun but gum is stuck to my shoes

I'm only human
I'm not perfect, just a person
I'm only human
Sometimes happy, sometimes nervous
I'm only human
I'm not perfect, just a person
I'm only human
Sometimes happy, sometimes nervous

I'm new to this game
I ain't been here long
So forgive me if I get this wrong
I get lost sometimes
Italy... I Rome
Had to figure certain things on my own
Make a phone call home
To the ones I love
Shit crazy out here
Have you high on drugs
To be real man
I thought about pulling the plug
So I can go fly high with the ones above...

I don't wanna be judged
I just wanna be me
Even tho we buy chains
We just wanna be free
I don't wanna be judged
I just wanna be me
We just wanna be free

You got to be the one the people lookin' up to
I tried to reach the sun but gum is stuck to my shoes
You got to be the one the people lookin' up to
I tried to reach the sun but gum is stuck to my shoes

I'm only human
I'm not perfect, just a person
I'm only human
Sometimes happy, sometimes nervous
I'm only human
I'm not perfect, just a person
I'm only human
Sometimes happy, sometimes nervous

The pros n the cons
Of being the bomb!
Baby, you can have the tick
Et might not be your time
But, often times I gotta remind
Myself to combine my thoughts
And never deny my health
A whole lot richer and
A whole lot quicker
But I had to slow it down
Cause I ain't no grave digger
White folks yelling
Yo, that's a brave nigga!
Paparazzi taking pictures
Like I'm in a cage nigga!

I don't wanna be judged
I just wanna be me
Even tho we buy chains
We just wanna be free
I don't wanna be judged
I just wanna be me
We just wanna be free

You got to be the one the people lookin' up to
I tried to reach the sun but gum is stuck to my shoes
You got to be the one the people lookin' up to
I tried to reach the sun but gum is stuck to my shoes

I'm only human
I'm not perfect, just a person
I'm only human
Sometimes happy, sometimes nervous
I'm only human
I'm not perfect, just a person
I'm only human
Sometimes happy, sometimes nervous

If I drive off the bridge, tell them that I live, my life like a kid, captain of my ship (wavy, wavy, wavy, wavy, wavy)
If I should lose control, my body and soul, I pray you would know which way to go (go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go)

This shit feel like I won't ever make it home
Drive fast, back home I got to get off of this road (skrt)
Foot on the gas I swear to god I'm in my zone
Foot on the gas I can't stop I got tippy toes (yeah, I'm in my zone)

Red light, green light, yellow light, green light
Red light, green light, yellow light, green light
Red light, green light, red light, green light
Red light, green light

Red light (stop), green light (go)
Yellow light (slow down), green light (oh no)
Red light, green light, yellow light, green light
Red light, green light, yellow light, green light

Okay, they can't take my attitude
Shortcut, this the avenue
Shit, I had to move, did what I had to do
Doing good to be mad at you

// Story To Tell //

Everybody's always askin'
How'd you get on We Run the Streets?
Think its 'bout time I tell y'all a little story (Little story)
Yo, yo

Look, I came home from school
I was on my way to sleep
Even kicked off my sneaks and put some Nas on repeat
Got a knock on my door, little sister yellin "Dizzle come on!"
I replied in the crack of a yawn
Then my mom stomped upstairs, looking all mean
She said if you wanna stay home, you gon have to clean
The bathroom, the dishes, and mop the whole kitchen
Said mom where we goin' to see how grandma is living?
I was too tired, and I ain't care to hear it
But my grandmas gettin' older and her death a really fear it
This whole time I was thinkin' too deep
I had this gut feelin' keep tellin' me to hop in the jeep (Beep beep)
I hear my mom honking the horn so I threw on some clothes and took off my uniform
I was chillin' in the car, push back my seat and all
Turn the radio up and started bobbin' my skull
All in the days, I was staring out the window
Thinkin' to myself like "When I'm gonna win yo?"
Rapping for a while but I just can't seem to make it
Second guessin' myself, I thought my skills had been wasted
But that wasn't the deal, that day I was depressed
I failed my Chemistry test, I'm talkin' straight F
Ridin through the city, no Philly to be specific
Rode past 18th & Oxford and dudes were spittin'
My mom said "Go rap, go on, just do it"
This could be your big break and it seemed like she knew it
Mother knows best so you know I got to it
I hopped out the ride and I was ready to influence
I did it, I killed it, but I was pretty nervous
Got a call that night and it was, it was pretty urgent
A guy named Ant, CEO We Run the Streets
He had filmed famous casts, like Cassidy and even me
I was shocked when he said he had posted up my video
Crazy feedback, I was the talk of the city yo!
One night, six thousand views, you know how I do
First lady, We Run the Streets, now guess who I be
D-I double Z L-E

Let the beat rock

// Upside Down //

Had a dream I died, woke up I'm alive
Help me with the truth, I be with the lies
Look all at my shoes, they need to be tied
You don't qualify, hello and goodbye
Kept the water running, couldn't hear me cry
Saw me read the message but I ain't reply
On the search for love, bet you can supply
[?] can't you see I gave him breast and thighs
Money I'mma buy [?] in July
He was growing in so far he went inside
I don't like surprise, this is what my eyes
See you always watching, should have been inspired
I spy with my brown eyes
This ain't what I asked for

Today, tonight, I might lose sight
Wake up upside down down down down

Wake up upside down down down down

Mom had it, hard working
Heartbreaker need a heart surgeon
Talk about myself in third person
Heard she doing bad, kid's cursing
Bitch nigga shit dick ass
Money calling cause it must be urgent
Pick the phone up, what's the verdict
Wrap it up cause I heard she burning
Too determined, no detergent
Do a nigga dirty with new purpose
I been learning how to be a savage
Daddy taught me well, stupid bastard
What goes around usually make a circle
Better watch your back cause they coming to hurt you

Today, tonight, I might lose sight
Wake up upside down down down down
Today, tonight, I might lose sight
Wake up upside down down down down
Yeah, yeah, down by the river you were faking for cash
