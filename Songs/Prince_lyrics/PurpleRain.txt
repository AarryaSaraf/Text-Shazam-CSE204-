Album: PurpleRain

// Let's Go Crazy //

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called life

Electric word life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you
There's something else
The afterworld

A world of never-ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby

'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own

And if the elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy - punch a higher floor

If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends

You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
"Uh uh" was all I heard

Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die

And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for (what's it all for)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

C'mon baby
Let's get nuts
Yeah

Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!
Go crazy

I said let's go crazy (go crazy)
Let's go, let's go
Go
Let's go

Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough, children

He's coming
He's coming
Coming

Take me away!

// Take Me With U //

I can't disguise the pounding of my heart
It beats so strong
It's in your eyes what can I say
They turn me on

I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care pretty baby
Just take me with u

Come on and touch the place in me
That's calling out your name
We want each other oh so much
Why must we play this game?

Don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care pretty baby
Just take me with u

I don't care if we spend the night at your mansion
I don't care if we spend the night on the town
All I want is 2 spend the night together
All I want is 2 spend the night in your arms

To be around u is so-oh right
You're sheer perfection (thank u)
Drive me crazy, drive me all night
Just don't break up the connection

I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care pretty baby
Just take me with u

I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care pretty baby
Just take me with u

Just take me with u
Oh won't u take me with u
Honey take me with u

// The Beautiful Ones //

Baby, baby, baby

Don't make me waste my time
Don't make me lose my mind baby

Baby, baby, baby

Oh baby, baby, baby
Don't my kisses please u right

The beautiful ones
Always smash the picture
Always everytime

That I was in love with u
Oh baby, baby, baby

Where is my love life?

Where has it gone?
Somebody please please tell me what the hell is wrong

Until I find the righteous 1

// Darling Nikki //

I knew a girl named Nikki
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine
She said how'd you like to waste some time
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind

Nikki

The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sho'nuff sho'nuff show you how to grind

Darlin' Nikki

Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank you for a funky time
Call me up whenever you want to grind

Oh, Nikki, ohhhh

Come back Nikki, come back
Your dirty little Prince
Wanna grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind

[backwards at the end...]
"Hello, how are you? I'm fine. 'cause I know
That the Lord is coming soon, coming, coming soon."

// When Doves Cry //

Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling
Can you picture this?

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (A world that's so cold)
Maybe you're just too demanding (Maybe, maybe I'm like my father)
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold (Ya know he's too bold)
Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (She's never, never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other (Why do we scream, why)
This is what it sounds like

When doves cry
When doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry)
When doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry)

Don't Cry (Don't Cry)

When doves cry
When doves cry
When doves cry

When Doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry, doves cry
Don't cry
Darling don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't don't cry

// I Would Die 4 U //

I'm not a woman
I'm not a man
I am something that you'll never understand

I'll never beat you
I'll never lie
And if you're evil I'll forgive you by and by

You, I would die for you, yeah
Darling if you want me to
You, I would die for you

I'm not your lover
I'm not your friend
I am something that you'll never comprehend

No need to worry
No need to cry
I'm your messiah and you're the reason why

'Cause you, I would die for you, yeah
Darling if you want me to
You, I would die for you

You're just a sinner I am told
Be your fire when you're cold
Make you happy when you're sad
Make you good when you are bad

I'm not a human
I am a dove
I'm your conscious
I am love
All I really need is to know that
You believe

Yeah, I would die for you, yeah
Darling if you want me to
You, I would die for you

Yeah, say one more time

You, I would die for you
Darling if you want me to
You, I would die for you
2 3 4 You

I would die for you
I would die for you
You, I would die for you
You, I would die for you

All their taste is in their mouth.
Really. What the fuck do they know?
Come on baby. Let's go... crazy"

// Purple Rain //

I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted one time to see you laughing
I only want to see you laughing in the purple rain

Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain

I only want to see you bathing in the purple rain

I never wanted to be your weekend lover
I only wanted to be some kind of friend
Baby, I could never steal you from another
It's such a shame our friendship had to end

Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain

I only want to see you underneath the purple rain

Honey I know, I know, I know times are changing
It's time we all reach out for something new
That means you too
You say you want a leader
But you can't seem to make up your mind
I think you better close it
And let me guide you to the purple rain

Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain

If you know what I'm singing about up here
C'mon, raise your hand

Purple rain, purple rain

I only want to see you, only want to see you
In the purple rain

// The Dance Electric //

Good morning children
Take a look out your window
Our world is falling
It's almost time to go
(Dance)
Dance the Dance Electric
The rhythm is love and love is blind
Love your enemies
There isn't much time, there isn't much time

Look - our world is falling
A rhythmless house of blinded prophecy
Hear our Master calling
This isn't what He wanted us to be

We got to dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go

Don't - it don't make you happy
To give another someone your own smile
Dance the dance electric
Never mind your hatred, try a brand new style

Dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go

We... love... all... enemies

Look - you're livin' in Babylon
Makin', but not feelin' love at all
When your youth is gone, when it comes to dawn
A light of truth will shine and you will fall

That's why you got to dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go

See the light inside of us
It's darkened if we live a life that's bad
Whatever you do, don't you let your light go dark my love
It's the only light that you will ever have

Why don't you dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go
(almost time to)
Dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go

// Love And Sex //

One, two, three, four

Come on, baby, hurt me in the upper room
Sha la la la sha la la boom
Love and sex in the upper room

Or will you come and kiss me
How am I supposed to sleep
Without you in my arms

Keep singin'
Sha la la la sha la la boom
Come on, baby, hurt me in the upper room
Sha la la la sha la la boom
Love and sex in the upper room
Photos

Just one single sexy glance or two
That's what kind of party is the cool
Sha la la boom
I put on my Sunday best

Sha boom

When we all die
And go to heaven
Will He let us fantasize
Is there some new cool surprise?

[Spoken Intro - Lisa Coleman and Wendy Melvoin:]
Wendy?
Yes, Lisa?
Is the water warm enough?
Yes, Lisa
Shall we begin?
Yes, Lisa

[Prince:]
Where is my love life?
Where can it be?
There must be something wrong with the machinery
Where is my love life?
Tell me, where has it gone?
Somebody please please tell me what the hell is wrong

Till I find the righteous one
Computer blue
Till I find the righteous one

[Solo]

[Ad lib:]
The computer's on the verge of breakdown!
Come on
Aw baby, don't make me

[Spoken Interlude - Wendy Melvoin & Lisa Coleman:]
Poor lonely computer
It's time someone programmed you
It's time you learned love and lust
They both have four letters
But they're entirely different words
Poor lonely computer
Poor, poor lonely computer
Do you really know what love is?

[Prince:]
(Na, na, na, na, na)
Wave your hands in the air
Now everybody sing it (Na, na, na, na, na)
Everybody work out
Work out, work out (Na, na, na, na, na)
Everybody work out
Work out, work out (Na, na, na, na, na)
Everybody work out

[Spoken Interlude - Prince:]
He didn't like living home alone
The house where he lived had many hallways
It was a long walk to his bedroom
Because to him each hallway represented an emotion
Every one vastly different from the next
One day while she was with him he decided to name each one of them
She was at his side, one hand on his thigh
No, wait
She was sort of half a step behind him
Yeah
The grip on his thigh intensified as they walked slowly through the corridor
He named the hallway "Lust"
And as they passed thru the next one
He named it "Fear"
The grip she now loosened so he walked faster
Her hands now trembling
She let drop to her side as he wrote the word "Insecurity"
He looked n her eyes and smiled a demon smile
And quickly walked on to the next
Corridor after corridor he named almost all when suddenly
He stopped
He picked up the word "Hate"
She was gone
So he picked up the last one
"Pain"

[Solo]

[Ad lib - Prince:]
On the verge of a breakdown
What is life without love?
It's hell Computer Blue!

[Prince:]
Father, Father, the sun is gone
(Father, Father) The dawn, the dawn
Father, Father, where is the dawn?
(Where is the dawn, Father?)
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na (Na, na, na, na, na)

Shall I go to church on Sundays?
Shall I stay home and pray?
Shall I try to make her happy?
Shall I try to make her stay?

[Spoken Interlude - Wendy Melvoin & Lisa Coleman (Prince):]
Narrow-minded computer
(Somebody please, please tell me)
It's time someone programmed you
(Somebody please, please tell me what's wrong with me)
It's time you learned women are not butterflies
They're computers too
Just like you Computer Blue
(Where is my baby?)
Chauvinistic computer
It's time someone programmed you
(Na, na, na, na, na)
You fall n love too fast and hate too soon
And take for granted the feeling's mutual
(The feeling's mutual!)
We're computers too
Just like you Computer Blue

// Electric Intercourse //

I feel some kind of love for you
And I don't even know your name
This is the kind of love that takes two
I want you and I'm not ashamed

'Cause baby, you shock my wild
With a sexual electricity extraordinaire
Come and take advantage, undress me
I don't even know you, I don't even care

I feel some kind of sexual current
Tell me do you feel it too?
Our bodies want to be together
Girl, I wanna be with you

Electric is my body, baby
I will shock you with my lips
Darling, don't you know
Your Technicolor climax is at my fingertips

Electric intercourse, electric intercourse
Don't you wanna?
Electric intercourse, electric intercourse
Don't you wanna make love, love, love?

Electric is my body, baby
I will shock you with my lips
Darling, don't you know
Your Technicolor climax is at my fingertips

Mmm
I want a true love and that's that

// Katrina's Paper Dolls //

Katrina makes paper dolls
One doll for every day
One doll for every day her old man's been gone
Katrina makes paper dolls
For every time he told her
For every time he told her that their love was too strong

There's no way to tell who's real and who's not
Baby, it's so much harder when your body's hot
She says that love is just a game or so it seems in many circles
Maybe that's what makes her world go round

Katrina makes paper dolls
They all look the same
They play the same games
Katrina makes paper dolls
It's better than being lonely
And love will make you lonely in the eyes of this dame, ooh, oh

There's no way to tell who's real and who's not
Baby, it's so much harder when your body's hot
She says love is just a game or so it seems in many circles
Maybe that's what makes her world go round

Katrina makes paper dolls
It's better than being lonely
Love will make you lonely
In the eyes of this dame
They're all just paper dolls

(La, la, la, la)
Da, da
(La, la, la, la)
Da, da
(La, la, la, la)
Ooh
Katrina's paper dolls
Love will make you horny
(La, la, la, la)
Ooh
La, la, la, la

Ooh

// We Can Fuck //

I could tell you stories until you get tired
I could play with your mind
But you'd probably say that I was a liar
So I won't waste your time
I'm scared because though we just met
There's this energy between us
Let's just go somewhere, we can fuck

I could say I'm sorry all of my life
That wouldn't be true.
I only say and do the things that I do
'Cause I'm in love with you

I'm scared because though we just met
I want you so bad, baby
Don't you want to come with me
We can fuck

Oh oh ooh
We can fuck
Oh oh ooh
We can fuck

No, this isn't something I've said many times before
But what difference does it make?
That was them, this is you
Oh, can't you see this room is electric?
Okay, well then maybe it's me,
but I know the smell of desire,
honey, it's all over you

I could tell you things to get you excited, things you never heard
You know the Kama Sutra?
I could re-write it with half as many words
I'm scared, because if I don't kiss you
I'm going to go mad, baby
Take off my clothes
We can fuck

Oh oh ooh
We can fuck
Oh oh ooh
We can fuck
[2x]

Wait a minute, let me turn on some lights
(We can fuck)
Is that better?
Come here
You can blow the candle off baby
You can turn the candle on
Which ever one you choose is alright
Because we're going to do it all night long
Do you want to...
Undress me, babe
Shall I undress you?
You can leave your clothes on if you want to
And I can still do all I want to do to you
Sex between two people is alright
Whether they're in love or not
As long as they're not trying to hurt nobody
Just as long as it's hot
Baby, I want to make love to you
Two times maybe three
Yeah, if you want to go four or five, baby that's alright with me
Let me tell you, I will be your little baby
Yeah, I can be your big strong man
I can be your girl or boy
I can be your toy
Alright, let's dance
It's up to you
You can fuck me, baby
I'll fuck you
We can fuck one another
Whatever you want to do
You got an electric ass, baby
You got electric thighs, baby
Ow, I can't wait no longer, child
It's getting stronger, baby
Open up your eyes
Ow!
See this gold chain around my waist?
Yeah, I want to give it to you
When people tell me I got no taste
Blow this candle out
Let's see if it's true

Oh baby, this is excellent
No, no, it is really
It's like
I'm sorry, it's just
I don't know
I've just never felt this way before
No, I'm really happy, really
Well, I guess, I met you and I just don't deserve it
Because you're so special
No I'm not, not like you
You're perfect
You really are
There are so many things I want to do with you
There are so many things I want to do for you
Listen, don't ever love anybody else
You don't have any reason to feel insecure
You're the best
Would you believe that?
No one can ever, ever, hurt you
Yes, I love you
I know it sounds strange, but I do
I do
I knew I loved you the split second before we kissed
Oh darling, kiss me now
Wait
Please fuck me again

// Let's Go Crazy //

Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called life

Electric word life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you
There's something else
The afterworld

A world of never-ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby

'Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
In this life
You're on your own

And if the elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy - punch a higher floor

If you don't like the world you're living in
Take a look around you
At least you got friends

You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
"Uh uh" was all I heard

Are we gonna let the elevator
Bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's 'cause
We're all gonna die

And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for (what's it all for)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

Tell me, are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

C'mon baby
Let's get nuts
Yeah

Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down
Oh, no let's go!
Go crazy

I said let's go crazy (go crazy)
Let's go, let's go
Go
Let's go

Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough, children

He's coming
He's coming
Coming

Take me away!

// Take Me With U //

I can't disguise the pounding of my heart
It beats so strong
It's in your eyes what can I say
They turn me on

I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care pretty baby
Just take me with u

Come on and touch the place in me
That's calling out your name
We want each other oh so much
Why must we play this game?

Don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care pretty baby
Just take me with u

I don't care if we spend the night at your mansion
I don't care if we spend the night on the town
All I want is 2 spend the night together
All I want is 2 spend the night in your arms

To be around u is so-oh right
You're sheer perfection (thank u)
Drive me crazy, drive me all night
Just don't break up the connection

I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do
I don't care pretty baby
Just take me with u

I don't care where we go
I don't care what we do

// Darling Nikki //

I knew a girl named Nikki
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine
She said how'd you like to waste some time
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said sign your name on the dotted line
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind

Nikki

The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her lovin' will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sho'nuff sho'nuff show you how to grind

Darlin' Nikki

Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said thank you for a funky time
Call me up whenever you want to grind

Oh, Nikki, ohhhh

Come back Nikki, come back
Your dirty little Prince
Wanna grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind

[backwards at the end...]
"Hello, how are you? I'm fine. 'cause I know
That the Lord is coming soon, coming, coming soon."

// When Doves Cry //

Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling
Can you picture this?

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold? (World so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (A world that's so cold)
Maybe you're just too demanding (Maybe, maybe I'm like my father)
Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold (Ya know he's too bold)
Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (She's never, never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other (Why do we scream, why)
This is what it sounds like

When doves cry
When doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry)
When doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry)

Don't Cry (Don't Cry)

When doves cry
When doves cry
When doves cry

When Doves cry (Doves cry, doves cry, doves cry
Don't cry
Darling don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't don't cry

// I Would Die 4 U //

I'm not a woman

And if you're evil I'll forgive you by and by

You, I would die for you, yeah
Darling if you want me to
You, I would die for you

'Cause you, I would die for you, yeah

Be your fire when you're cold
Make you happy when you're sad
Make you good when you are bad

I'm your conscious
I am love
All I really need is to know that
You believe

Yeah, I would die for you, yeah

I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to cause you any pain
I only wanted one time to see you laughing
I only want to see you laughing in the purple rain

Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain

Honey I know, I know, I know times are changing
It's time we all reach out for something new

I think you better close it
And let me guide you to the purple rain

// The Dance Electric //

Good morning children
Take a look out your window
Our world is falling
It's almost time to go
(Dance)
Dance the Dance Electric
The rhythm is love and love is blind
Love your enemies
There isn't much time, there isn't much time

Look - our world is falling
A rhythmless house of blinded prophecy
Hear our Master calling
This isn't what He wanted us to be

We got to dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go

Don't - it don't make you happy
To give another someone your own smile
Dance the dance electric
Never mind your hatred, try a brand new style

Dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go

We... love... all... enemies

Look - you're livin' in Babylon
Makin', but not feelin' love at all
When your youth is gone, when it comes to dawn
A light of truth will shine and you will fall

That's why you got to dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go

See the light inside of us
It's darkened if we live a life that's bad
Whatever you do, don't you let your light go dark my love
It's the only light that you will ever have

Why don't you dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go
(almost time to)
Dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go

Come on
Aw baby, don't make me

[Spoken Interlude - Wendy Melvoin & Lisa Coleman:]
Poor lonely computer
It's time someone programmed you
It's time you learned love and lust
They both have four letters
But they're entirely different words
Poor lonely computer
Poor, poor lonely computer
Do you really know what love is?

[Prince:]
(Na, na, na, na, na)
Wave your hands in the air
Now everybody sing it (Na, na, na, na, na)
Everybody work out
Work out, work out (Na, na, na, na, na)
Everybody work out
Work out, work out (Na, na, na, na, na)
Everybody work out

[Spoken Interlude - Prince:]
He didn't like living home alone
The house where he lived had many hallways
It was a long walk to his bedroom
Because to him each hallway represented an emotion
Every one vastly different from the next
One day while she was with him he decided to name each one of them
She was at his side, one hand on his thigh
No, wait
She was sort of half a step behind him
Yeah
The grip on his thigh intensified as they walked slowly through the corridor
He named the hallway "Lust"
And as they passed thru the next one
He named it "Fear"
The grip she now loosened so he walked faster
Her hands now trembling
She let drop to her side as he wrote the word "Insecurity"
He looked n her eyes and smiled a demon smile
And quickly walked on to the next
Corridor after corridor he named almost all when suddenly
He stopped
He picked up the word "Hate"
She was gone
So he picked up the last one
"Pain"

[Solo]

[Ad lib - Prince:]

The moment you came to town
My life sings all around
Twenty quarters to your name
Five George Washingtons
No one to blame

Oh, look, it's written in the sky above
Our destiny is to fall in love
Don't fight it 'cause it's stronger than us
Our destiny is to fall in love
I fell in love

I knew when I saw you walk
I had to talk to you
I didn't know what to say
I wanted your love anyways

Oh, look, it's written in the sky above
Our destiny is to fall in love
Don't fight it 'cause it's stronger than us
Our destiny is to fall in love
I fell in love

Look, I'm not sayin' ket's get married or nothing
I'm not ready to settle down
And I don't wanna have your baby
But you gotta be the finest specimen I've ever seen

Our destiny is to fall in love
I fell in love
I fell in love
I fell in love

I'm smitten with that kiss that you steal
Babe, I would never treat you like this
I have passions, tingle
Let's find a room
Do you want me?
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you

[Roadhouse Garden]

[Prince:]
This is the road that leads to where I live
See the house, open the door
It's alright, it's alright

This is the house where we used to play
We're open nights, we're open days
It's alright, it's alright

This is the garden where emotions grow
Twenty-four feelings all in a row
It's alright, yeah, it's alright

Talkin' about the roadhouse garden
Oh, the roadhouse garden

This is the place where evil died
See the door, come inside
It's alright, it's alright

This is the house where life's the play
Don't let the color scare you away
It's alright, it's alright

This is the garden where emotions grow
Give 'em love, open your soul
It's alright, yeah, it's alright now

I'm talkin' about the roadhouse garden
Yeah, the roadhouse garden
Oh, come on in and let's groove

I'm talkin' about the roadhouse garden
The road, the road, roadhouse garden
Oh, the roadhouse garden, garden
The roadhouse garden, oh
Oh, oh

// Katrina's Paper Dolls //

Katrina makes paper dolls
One doll for every day
One doll for every day her old man's been gone
Katrina makes paper dolls
For every time he told her
For every time he told her that their love was too strong

There's no way to tell who's real and who's not
Baby, it's so much harder when your body's hot
She says that love is just a game or so it seems in many circles
Maybe that's what makes her world go round

Katrina makes paper dolls
They all look the same
They play the same games
Katrina makes paper dolls
It's better than being lonely
And love will make you lonely in the eyes of this dame, ooh, oh

There's no way to tell who's real and who's not
Baby, it's so much harder when your body's hot
She says love is just a game or so it seems in many circles
Maybe that's what makes her world go round

Katrina makes paper dolls
It's better than being lonely
Love will make you lonely
In the eyes of this dame
They're all just paper dolls

(La, la, la, la)
Da, da
(La, la, la, la)
Da, da
(La, la, la, la)
Ooh
Katrina's paper dolls
Love will make you horny
(La, la, la, la)
Ooh
La, la, la, la
Katrina's paper dolls
Ooh
Katrina's paper dolls
Katrina's paper dolls

// We Can Fuck //

I could tell you stories until you get tired
I could play with your mind
But you'd probably say that I was a liar
So I won't waste your time
I'm scared because though we just met
There's this energy between us
Let's just go somewhere, we can fuck

I could say I'm sorry all of my life
That wouldn't be true.
I only say and do the things that I do
'Cause I'm in love with you

I'm scared because though we just met
I want you so bad, baby
Don't you want to come with me
We can fuck

Oh oh ooh
We can fuck
Oh oh ooh
We can fuck

No, this isn't something I've said many times before
But what difference does it make?
That was them, this is you
Oh, can't you see this room is electric?
Okay, well then maybe it's me,
but I know the smell of desire,
honey, it's all over you

I could tell you things to get you excited, things you never heard
You know the Kama Sutra?
I could re-write it with half as many words
I'm scared, because if I don't kiss you
I'm going to go mad, baby
Take off my clothes
We can fuck

Oh oh ooh
We can fuck
Oh oh ooh
We can fuck
[2x]

Wait a minute, let me turn on some lights
(We can fuck)
Is that better?
Come here
You can blow the candle off baby
You can turn the candle on
Which ever one you choose is alright
Because we're going to do it all night long
Do you want to...
Undress me, babe
Shall I undress you?
You can leave your clothes on if you want to
And I can still do all I want to do to you
Sex between two people is alright
Whether they're in love or not
As long as they're not trying to hurt nobody
Just as long as it's hot
Baby, I want to make love to you
Two times maybe three
Yeah, if you want to go four or five, baby that's alright with me
Let me tell you, I will be your little baby
Yeah, I can be your big strong man
I can be your girl or boy
I can be your toy
Alright, let's dance
It's up to you
You can fuck me, baby
I'll fuck you
We can fuck one another
Whatever you want to do
You got an electric ass, baby
You got electric thighs, baby
Ow, I can't wait no longer, child
It's getting stronger, baby
Open up your eyes
Ow!
See this gold chain around my waist?
Yeah, I want to give it to you
When people tell me I got no taste
Blow this candle out
Let's see if it's true

Oh baby, this is excellent
No, no, it is really
It's like
I'm sorry, it's just
I don't know
I've just never felt this way before
No, I'm really happy, really
Well, I guess, I met you and I just don't deserve it
Because you're so special
No I'm not, not like you
You're perfect
You really are
There are so many things I want to do with you
There are so many things I want to do for you
Listen, don't ever love anybody else
You don't have any reason to feel insecure
You're the best
Would you believe that?
No one can ever, ever, hurt you
Yes, I love you
I know it sounds strange, but I do
I do
I knew I loved you the split second before we kissed
Oh darling, kiss me now
Wait
Please fuck me again
