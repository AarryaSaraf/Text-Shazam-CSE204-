[Prospect #1]

A twisted crash... vibrations forming my personal currency
A lifeline... a sweatbox, the linear mind as one
Who would have thought?
This distant face
Distant life... never before seen
Deep sleep in deep sea
Nerves are torn from their ends
Distant life... never before seen
Deep sleep in deep sea
Nerves are torn from their ends
It has been three nights and still the puzzle is cut by a shaky hand
Carved out of improper materials... imperfect directions
A crushing sound soon awakes
Where am I?
The taste of sand wipes away the grime of my past life
A crushing sound soon awakes
Where am I?
The taste of sand wipes away the grime of my past life
The life I fled... the grip I loosened
It has all caused an even pressure. The kind they show us on our screens
I've become what I've force-fed my entire life... a drifter's dream... a loner's mind
Wanting what they have... their perfect smiles and heartless lusts
On night four, they come back
Awaking a new life
Over and over... like I've been there before
Living and breathing, but still choking
A mirror stares back. I contort like the wheels in my head
On night four, they come back
Awakening a new life
Over and over... like I've been there before
Living and breathing, but still choking
A mirror stares back
Still nothing happens. Please wake up

[Prospect #2]

I open my eyes to the smell of morning skin
The soft touch of your hair
Your breath I breathe in
I open my eyes to the smell of morning skin
The soft touch of your hair
Your breath I breathe in
I open my eyes to the smell of morning skin
The soft touch of your hair
Your breath I breathe in, breathe in
The reality chases and catches up on actual alertness
I'm awake... a daydream... alone. Silence
This is the last few years rolled into one instance
I need something new

I jerk back in and out of a daydream self
A backwards day... water surrounds
A cool breeze wrapping its smell around my skin
I jerk back in and out of a daydream self
A backwards day... water surrounds
A cool breeze wrapping its smell around my skin
The midday siren awakes what was a false idea of sleep
Daydream society. Walking past what we used to see

Beginning again
Beginning again
Walking into a certain state of
Walking into a certain state of suffocation
Walking into a certain state of suffocation
Walking into
Confusion surrounds... day after day
The questions I face... the dealings I deal
Do I complete me? Do I complete humanity?
This day will determine it all

[Prospects #1 and #2]

Mirror stares back again. I contort like the wheels in my head
Still nothing ever happens. Please wake up
Mirror stares back again
I contort like the wheels in my head
Still nothing ever happens
Please wake up

// Augment Of Rebirth //

[Prospect #2]

Moving forward
Moving forward
Memories left behind. A new life, a new journey. I've built anew
For mankind... for my kind
For mankind... for my kind
The vessel stares back at me. From every angle, the menacing smile latches on
Talking walls speak and spell my life story
My past life
The vessel sleeps beside me... the comfort breath
Morning skin of machine, of humanity's beginnings
Am I god? I've been called worse... drift in and out
The vessel brings me sleep
Morning skin of machine, of humanity's beginnings
Drift in and out
The vessel brings me sleep
Hyper Sleep

[Prospect #1]

Mind bending strategy game. Running through obstacles on a land never ventured
Every night. Every wake
Alone but not for long
Alone but not for long
The signals worked. Did I want this? I must go back and explain my reasonings
Worse things have happened:
Worse things will happen
The signals worked
Did I want this?
I must go back and explain my reasonings
Worse things have happened
Worse things will happen
The old atlas is found. No matter what I do it's been done... it's been worse
This is not reassuring
Imperfect. Improper. Extinct
They have found me
This is not reassuring
Imperfect
Improper
Extinct
They have found me
A new journey

[Prospect #2]

They have found me
A new journey
They have found me
A new journey
They have found me
I approach unfamiliar ground
Left standing with the air swirling silently
A creepy siren, the siren of loneliness
Twisting, falling, and screaming

I approach unfamiliar ground. Left standing with the air swirling silently
A creepy siren, the siren of loneliness
Twisting, falling, and screaming
Please break out

The crumbling starts. Inch by inch the ground takes over
The wretched clench of my insides
Unspeakable anguish... this fucking contortion
Awake, mime standing

Air swirling around me... silent
Siren of loneliness. This is real isn't it? Can't tell these days, the longest fucking days
Why the anger I wonder?
To create
To recreate
To create
To recreate
Have I become a god?
I have been called much worse
Secretly that title makes me feel comfortable
In my place
It's been a while
This god-like complex does bring me a smile
To create
To recreate
To create
To recreate
Down to the last seed, I stand with a dark stare
Still silent, still frighteningly silent
Down to the last seed, I stand with a dark stare
Still silent, still frighteningly silent
I must leave myself

That's what all of this has gotten me... infinite life? Conquering of death
The seed is planted
Time to move on. What have I become?

I'll make my own life seem new
Face all of my mistakes and grow
I'll make my own life seem new
Face all of my mistakes and grow
Must grow, grow, grow

[Prospect #1]

Many days and fewer nights... so I'm told
I've lost my time years ago... so I'm told
The explaining. The whispered words
This will be the hardest part... so I'm told
I wish my mind would work... unfold
The explaining. The whispered words

The front door opened to the look of death. Will this make sense? Will this be comforting at all?
The questions dive in day and night. Nothing we can do. Nothing I can do
Twists and turns must be answered
I hit land... so it seems
The dirt chokes up my legs... strong air then shoots down my throat
Sensory overload in an instant of sense
Charting through old water that I pushed away to drown
Into another
To find and be found
This is what I've set out to do. Where is this door?

[Prospect #2]

The constant movement of my eyes. I can feel, but I can't open the lids. The back of my skin is scarred, torn and broken
A reflection of what I've seen. (What have I become?)
They let these people recreate. Maybe I should have ended it all
Too, too late?
Too, too late?
Moving forward is a must
Dig deep
Commence sleep
Dig deep
Commence sleep inside sleep
Dig deep
Commence sleep inside sleep
Silence

(An out of focus picture brings up a familiar scenario: Three people fill the room
There seems to be a fourth, but very small. We are speaking about some sort of
Mission. My mouth won't stop moving... talking way too much. Even through the
Blur I can feel their stares. This one sided discussion seems to be about what I am
Preventing. Is this a sign? Too late... I've said it before. The people then disappear
I look about and the western sky seems to be red... alone. I can smell burning
Flesh... scorched life. I turn around and the face of death stares so grim that the
Lids finally open...)

I come to

I'm close... Very close. But something isn't right
A horrifying realization is swept over me
Home
The empty space of home
All I've known is gone
All I've loved is lost
Silence
Home
The empty space of home
All I've known is gone
All I've loved is lost
Silence
Home
The empty space of home
All I've known is gone
All I've loved is lost
Silence
