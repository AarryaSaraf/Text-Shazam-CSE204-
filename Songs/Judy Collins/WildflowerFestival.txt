// Thirsty Boots //

You've long been on the open road
You've been sleepin' in the rain
From dirty words and mud of the cells
Your clothes are soiled and stained

But the dirty words and the muddy cells
Will soon be judged insane
So only stop and rest yourself
And you'll be off again

And take off your thirsty boots
And stay for a while
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile

And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

Then tell me of the ones you see
As far as you could see
Across the plains from field to town
A marchin' to be free

And of the rusted prison gates
That tumble by degree
Like laughin' children one by one
They look like you and me

So take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile

And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

I know you are no stranger
Down the crooked rainbow trial
From dancing cliff edge, shattered sills
Of slander shackled jails

But the melodies drift up from below
As walls are bein' scaled
Yes and all of this and more my friend
Your song shall not be failed

And take off your thirsty boots
And stay for a while
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile

And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

And take off your thirsty boots
And stay for a while
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile

And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes
