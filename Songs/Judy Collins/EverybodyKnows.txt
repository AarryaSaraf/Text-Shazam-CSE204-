// Who Knows Where The Time Goes //

Across the morning sky all the birds are leaving
Ah, how can they know it's time for them to go?
Before the winter fire we'll still be dreaming
I do not count the time

Who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

Sad deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time

Who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

Who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

And I am not alone while my love is near me
And I know it will be so 'till it's time to go
So come the storms of winter and then the birds in spring again
I do not fear the time

Who knows how my love grows?
Who knows where the time goes?
