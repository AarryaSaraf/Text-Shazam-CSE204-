// Mouth For War //

Revenge
I'm screaming revenge again
Wrong
I've been wrong for far too long
Been constantly so frustrated
I've moved mountains with less
When I channel my hate to productive
I don't find it hard to impress

[Pre]
Bones in traction
Hands break to hone raw energy
Bold and disastrous
My ears can't hear what you say to me

[Chorus]
Hold your mouth for the war
Use it for what it's for
Speak the truth about me
Determined

Possessed
I feel a conquering will down inside me
Strength
The strength of many to crush
Who might stop me
My strength is in number
And my soul lies in every one
The releasing of anger can better any medicine under the sun

[Pre]

[Chorus]

There comes a time within everyone to close your eyes to what's real
No comprehension to fail
I vacuum the wind for my sail
Can't be the rest
Let others waste my time
Owning success is the bottom line.
Like a knife into flesh
After life is to death
Pulling and punching the rest of duration
NO ONE can piss on this determination

// A New Level //

Now a new look in my eyes my spirit rise
Forget the past
Present tense works and lasts
Got shit on
Pissed on
Spit on
Stepped on
Fucked with
Pointed at by lesser men

[Pre]
New life in place of old life
Unscarred by trials

[Chorus]
A new level of confidence and power

Demanding plea for unity between us all --
United stand
Death before divided fall
In mock military order
Vulgar
Power
Impatient
Because time is shorter

[Pre]

[Chorus]

No fucking surrender
Can't lose
Life kills

// Rise //

We've got no time to lose
Your news is old news
Hate this, hate me, hate this
Right approach for the wrong
It's time to spread the word
Let the voice be heard
All of us, one of us, all of us
Dominate and take the motherfucking world

Mass prediction, unification
Breathing life into our lungs
EVERY creed and EVERY kind
To give us depth for strength

Taught when we're young to hate one another
It's time to have a new reign of power
Make pride universal so no one gives in
Turn our backs on those who oppose
Then when confronted we ask them the question
What's wrong with their mind?
What's wrong with your mind?

[Chorus]
It's time to RISE

We've lived with past mistakes
And we've lived with our own
Forgive, forget forgive
Be a man, not a child
There are no tears for peace
Of the common sympathies
Educate, reinstate, educate
A thing of past
The trouble in the states

It's time to rise

// No Good (Attack The Radical) //

In the states
There's a problem with race
Because of ignorant past burned fires
From evolution
We've been killing each other
I figure man should have it down to a science

No chance
Not for a minute
Not for a second
I won't be defensive
I'm straight out in my opinion
You'd better listen to a man who knows what he is saying
I've seen your side
You run and hide for the mere fact that you feel inferior
Be superior
And know your interior

[Pre]
Race, pride, prejudice
Black man, white man
No stand
Live in the past
We make it last
A hated mass
No solution
Mind pollution
For revolution

[Chorus]
So low behold my eyes
This land of fools will rise
No good
For no one

You blame oppression and play the role of criminals
To rape and burn show progress is minimal
White hoods and militants you know it's such a pity
Living, breathing
Violence in your city

If one man
Had one home
In one world
Held live alone without variety
Full of anxiety
No one to point at, question
Or even talk to -- in his private grave
No matter what color
He wouldn't be saved from hell
He dwells
A closed mind playing the part of prison cells

[Pre]

[Chorus]

// Live In A Hole //

Full of grief I scream at the wind
Thought I heard the words of others
Imprison myself
And stay in a shell
I won't let you in to have a story to tell
Things tend to drag me down
Don't understand so they hate me now

[Chorus]
My fear grips the will of stone
My grip fears I'll die alone

I promised myself somewhere in the teenage life
I'd never submit to the ones I will not be like
Live in a hole
But stay close to my kind
Cause they understand what burns in my mind
I still feel incomplete
Friends are few and far between

[Chorus]

// Regular People (Conceit) //

I've trampled on that road
That you think you own
You have that "smart ass" attitude
It's time to stop the fiction

I live it every day
While your mind's far away
I'm out here putting pride on the line
And you case on me with pure respect
One chance at one thing
Hard time is coming
My time, your pain
I reign on you

[Pre]
You think you own
I take away
Take it with me
You think you own
I took away
Made it my own

[Chorus]
Most regular people would say it's hard
And any streetwise son of a bitch knows
Don't fuck with this

The so many times
You practice in your mirror
To be just like me
But you just can't see
You ain't got the balls, son

I fight for love of brother
Your friends fight one another
You can't see because your head's up your ass
And just in case you think you're bad
I crush your rush
I rule YOU fool
I'm immovable stone in your world of weak -- I speak

[Pre]

[Chorus]

// By Demons Be Driven //

Serving the faith
Abduction the oath
It lie in wait for the offering
Religion is old
For drawing the young
Purity withers and dies
Never return to the ones that provided
Children draining parents of will
I hold out my hand to bloodless child
I'm taken by the one I was saving
From death

[Chorus]
By demons be driven
Beckon the call

With decline in mind
End not far
We're left hanging alone here
He pulls us from nails
Shatters our bones
Leaving us crippled and strewn
Boiling my corpse in the blood of his children
Praying for his god to prevail
Burying us with loved ones
To sleep with shelled children of the sixth dimension

[Chorus]

// Hollow //

What's left inside him?
Don't he remember us?
Can't he believe me?
We seemed like brothers
Talked for hours last month
About what we wanna be
I sit now with his hand in mine
But I know he can't feel...

No one knows
What's done is done
It's as if he were dead

I'm close with his mother
And she cries endlessly
Lord how we miss him
At least what's remembered
It's so important to make best friends in life
But it's hard when my friend sits with blank expressions

No one knows
What's done is done
It's as if he were dead

He as hollow as I alone now
He as hollow as I alone
A shell of my friend
Just flesh and bone
There's no soul
He sees no love
I shake my fists at skies above
Mad at God

He as hollow as I converse
I wish he'd waken from this curse
Hear my words before it's through
I want to come in after you
My best friend

He as hollow as I alone

// Piss //

Half assed for most his life
Done nothing but stand
Just because he's so small so
No one will give him a hand
The kinda guy that would steal your cast
And buy a burning house
Then call you up and invite you in
And jerk you off with a sandpaper hand

I'd leave him physically crippled
Without a leg to stand
I'd throw that trash away
Because a runt like that is piss in the wind
My fist would be the decider
I wasn't raised a fool
I'd stomp his ass for free
Because a punk like that is piss in the wind

Piss in the wind

A go-getter who ain't got none
A legend in his mind
Always the one to invite himself
And then just left behind
Someone must've clipped his balls
Or wiped his ass of his life
A self centered procrastinator
Attention seeker who's got nothing at all

I'd leave him physically crippled
Without a leg to stand
I'd throw that trash away
Because a runt like that is piss in the wind
My fist would be the decider
I wasn't raised a fool
I'd stomp his ass for free
Because a punk like that is piss in the wind
