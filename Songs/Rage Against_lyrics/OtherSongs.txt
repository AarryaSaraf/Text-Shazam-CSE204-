// Autologic //

C'mon!

Go...go...go...ugh..

Go...go...go...go...

Drop the A-U-T-O-L-O-G-I-C (go...go...go...go...)

Drop the A-U-T-O-L-O-G-I-C (go...go...go...go...)

Hey! (go...go...go...go...)

Drop the A-U-T-O-L-O-G-I-C (go...go...go...go...)

C'mon (go...go...go...go...)

Drop auto logic

You thought you could get wit'

Me and Tommy hittin' man

Cold dropped a smash hit

Angry as a battery

Back in the funk

'Cuz I'm not frontin'

Commin' upon the stage I'll say ya somethin'

Clear as a project

The style is hectic

Guess I'm left with

A system sceptic

The truths I'm droppin'

From the pulpit I'm yellin'

Inspired by gunshots from a township rebellion

Word is a rough mix

Sign of justice

The rhyme is allowed 'cuz you can't philabust this

Style I'll catch ya

I'll catch ya the rapture

Ya murdered my level head

Ya know that I have to...


Drop auto logic

Yo I got to drop the logic

Drop auto logic

Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic


Auto logic

Yo I got to drop the logic

Drop auto logic

Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic


Stop before you take a wrong turn

Stop before you step up on the stage and get burned

Stop and just listen

I'm dismissing competition with decisions

So I guess you'll have to listen and learn


Creative

So what ya gonna do?

Ain't no fading

So what ya gonna do?

Grab the microphone and say a check one two

The kid's solo

Unafraid of any crew

'Cuz I'm the type of mother with the maddest

Status

Statue or poll

Paid in full

No bull never dull

Always in control

Taking no shit like I was Manute Boll

Ugh...huh...huh


Awww ya...

It goes a just like that...ya...

Now break it down...


Auto logic

On auto pilot

Silence equals death

And death equals silence

The crew that doesn't choose to speak their mind

Is a crew that looses power over time

And now that ya finally woke up

Yo wish your mother fuckin' ass would have spoke up

Voices in full

The balled of the bullet

The mic is a trigger and I pull it

Droppin' and smashin'

Thrashin' and bashin' the set

Mentally and spiritually correct

Back!...and ya know it's a treat

'Cuz every time I step ya know I won't forget ta...


Drop auto logic

Yo I got to drop the logic

Drop auto logic

Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic


Auto logic

Yo I got to drop the logic

Drop auto logic

Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic


Auto logic (go...go...go...go...)

Yo I got to drop the logic

Drop auto logic

Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic


Auto logic (go...go...go...go...)

Yo I got to drop the logic

Drop auto logic

Yo I got to drop the drop the drop drop the logic

C'mon

// Can't Kill The Revolution //

[Maynard:]

Living on the street shores

He didn't learn and wanted children

Said, "What is there left to stay alive for?"

He doesn't wanna see it..

[Maynard:]

He didn't wanna deal with it

Here they come, feelings that come as natural

Whatever left, he considered a loss, y'all

He doesn't wanna see it...

[Maynard:]

Running away, getting some kinda cure

"What is there left to keep him alive?" she said

Give him your love, give him your love to save him

Give him your love, give him your love to save him

[Maynard:]

Give him your love, give him your love to save him

Don't run away, give him your love to save him

Give him your love, give him your love to save him

Give him your love...

[Zack 2x:]

You can kill the revolutionary

But you can't kill the revolution

[Zack & Maynard 2x:]

You can kill the revolutionary

But you can't kill the revolution

[Zack:]

Lies, negative indoctrination of our good selves

Promote feelings of such hopelessness, powerlessness

Suicide or a slower death from addiction

seemed to be the only way to stop the pain

[Maynard:]

Running...

[Zack:]

Lies, negative indoctrination of our good selves

Promote feelings of such hopelessness, powerlessness Suicide or a slower death from addiction

seemed to be the only way to stop the pain

[Zack:]

Suicide seemed to be the only way to stop the pain

Suicide seemed to be the only way to stop the pain

[Zack 2x:]

You can kill the revolutionary

But you can't kill the revolution

[Zack & Maynard 4x:]

You can kill the revolutionary

But you can't kill the revolution

// Clamp Down //

Clamp down


What are we gonna do now?

Yeah, Taking off his turban, they said, is this man a Jew?

Cause they're working for the clampdown

They put up a poster saying we earn more than you!

When we're working for the clampdown

We will teach our twisted speech

To the young believers

We will train our blue-eyed men

To be young believers


The judge said five to ten-but I say double that again

I'm not working for the clamp down

No man born with a living soul

Can be working for the clampdown

Kick over the wall 'cause government's to fall

How can you refuse it?

Let fury have the hour, anger can be power

D'you know that you can use it?


The voices in your head are calling

Stop wasting your time boy there's nothing coming

Only a fool would think somebody could save you

The men at the factory are old and cunning

You don't owe nothing, so boy get runnin'

It's the best years of your life they want to steal


You grow up and you calm down

You're working for the clampdown

You start wearing the blue and brown

You're working for the clampdown

So you got someone to boss around

It makes you feel big now

You drift until you brutalize

Take your gun, kill now


In these days of evil presidentes

Working for the clampdown

But lately one or two has fully paid their due

For working for the clampdown

But ha! Gitalong! Gitalong!

waiting to be nothing now

waiting to be nothing now

c'mon

oww shit

// Clear The Lane //

Hey yo!

Let me be front

This is real and not a stunt

I'm comin' to the forefront

Shovel for the rapper and clear the lane

'Cos this jam is like a tomahawk chop

Teach ya I'll never stop droppin' topics

Vocal power?

(a)yes I got it

On central but their trying to clamp it down

Flag was waving the wrong way so I shot it...down!

Get down, and at the same time...

Come up...down!

This is a crime that shut us up

I don't give a fuck

'Cos the words and the thoughts still hit

And like I said

It's not a skit

Jump another hit

Yeah

Ya know I don't need a drum kit

Make 'em say awwww shit!

The rebellion is true and legit


Down! Get down!...and clear the lane

Down! Get down!...and clear the lane

Down! Get down!...and clear the land

Down! Get down!...yeah!


The rebel

You'll never disable

Defiance

With the cards upon the table

Pulling cards

Keep the governments in check

Yo!

I think we need a new deck

Never could trust a phillabusta'

The mic is like a fist and it'll bust ya

With words cold hittin' with the underground

And now you're checkin' out the new sound

Live hit

A live pop

Live rock

And ya don't stop

It goes on and on and on

Who's a threat?

C'mon, the war is on!


Down! Get down!...and clear the lane

Down! Get down!...and clear the lane

Down! Get down!...and clear the lane

Down! Get down!...and clear the lane

[guitar solo]


Start droppin'

Our words are never safe

Fighting myself

'Till I'm where I gotta be

I challenge, don't sweat it

Now don't you forget it

Check me? What? Wait

You better slow down!

Realize I can't confine my rhyme to a beat

I need cash so when I'm cool I'm never ever weak

Places are fluid and diluted and complete

Check me once, calm down and take a seat

Strip the chains the freedom's there but then it's gone!


Ugh...clear the lane

Ugh...clear the lane

Ugh...clear the lane

Ugh...clear the lane


Defiance

Rippin' up the sound set

Every time I'm grippin' the mic it is a sound threat

Resist against the suckers that bring the bass in

Timmy C

Bring that bass in!


Ugh...clear the lane

Ugh...clear the lane

Ugh...clear the lane

Ugh...clear the lane

// Darkness //

Greed!

Causing innocent blood to flow

Entire culture, lost in the overthrow

They came to seize and take whatever they please

Then all they gave back was death and disease

My people were left with no choice but to decide

To conform to a system, responsible for genocide

Responsible for genocide

Responsible for genocide...

[Spoken:]

'AIDS is killing the entire African nation

And a vaccine is still supposedly under preparation

But these governments they don't mind the procrastination

They say "We'll kill them off, take their land and go there for vaction.'


My people's culture was strong, it was pure

And if not for that white greed

It would've endured

My people were left with no choice but to decide

To conform to a system

Their minds enslaved

Their souls encaged

I feel the rage

It's brutality can never be undone

But the sun is not yet set

The bass and drums and microphones a threat

That's when ya investigate the crimes from the inside

And see that they're responsible for genocide

Responsible for genocide

Responsible for genocide...


Ya cram ya culture down my throat

Say I'm inferior when I find that I choke

Ya fill my mind with a false sense of history

And then you wonder why I have no identity?

Well I'll strike a match and it'll catch and

Spread the insight we need

A tiny fire, burning bright

Shedding light on the darkness of greed


A yes yes y'all

And ya don't stop

Shedding light on the darkness of greed


A yes yes y'all

And ya don't stop

Shedding light on the darkness of greed.


Yeah!

// Fuck The Police //

To be beatin on, and throwin in jail.

With a little bit of gold and a pager.

Searchin my car, lookin for the product.

Thinkin every nigga is sellin narcotics.


You'd rather see me in the pen,

Then me and Lorenzo chilling in the Benzo.

Beat tha police outta shape,

And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape,

To mark off the scene of the slaughter.

No controller, bread and water.

And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath,

Of cops, dyin in L. A.


Yo, I got somethin to say.

But don't let it be a black and a white one.

Cuz they slam ya down to the street top,

Black police showin out for the white cop.

On any mutha fucka in a blue uniform.

Just cuz we in Washington D.C, punk police are afraid of me.

// Hadda Be Playing On The Jukebox //

It had to be flashin' like the daily double

It had to be playin' on TV

It had to be loud mouthed on the comedy hour

It had to be announced over loud speakers


The CIA and the Mafia are in cahoots


It had to be said in old ladies' language

It had to be said in American headlines

Kennedy stretched and smiled and got double crossed by lowlife goons and agents

Rich bankers with criminal connections

Dope pushers in CIA working with dope pushers from Cuba working with a

big time syndicate from Tampa, Florida

And it had to be said with a big mouth


It had to be moaned over factory foghorns

It had to be chattered on car radio news broadcasts

It had to be screamed in the kitchen

It had to be yelled in the basement where uncles were fighting


It had to be howled on the streets by newsboys to bus conductors

It had to be foghorned into New York harbor

It had to echo onto hard hats

It had to turn up the volume in university ballrooms


It had to be written in library books, footnoted

It had to be in the headlines of the Times and Le Monde

It had to be barked on TV

It had to be heard in alleys through ballroom doors


It had to be played on wire services

It had to be bells ringing

Comedians stopped dead in the middle of a joke in Las Vegas


It had to be FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover and Frank Costello syndicate

mouthpiece meeting in Central Park, New York weekends,

reported Time magazine


It had to be the Mafia and the CIA together starting war on Cuba,

Bay of Pigs and poison assassination headlines


It had to be dope cops in the Mafia

Who sold all their heroin in America


It had to be the FBI and organized crime working together

in cahoots against the commies


It had to be ringing on multinational cash registers

A world-wide laundry for organized criminal money


It had to be the CIA and the Mafia and the FBI together

They were bigger than Nixon

And they were bigger than war


It had to be a large room full of murder

It had to be a mounted ass- a solid mass of rage

A red hot head

A scream in the back of the throat


It had to be in Kissinger's brain

It had to be in Rockefellers' mouth

It had to be central intelligence, the family, all of this, the agency Mafia

It had to be organized crime


One big set of gangs working together in cahoots


Hitmen

Murderers everywhere


The secret

The drunk

The brutal

The dirty and rich


On top of a slag heap of prisons

Industrial cancer

Plutonium smog

Garbage cities


Grandmas' bedsores, fathers' resentment


It had to be the rulers

They wanted law and order

And they got rich on wanting protection for the status quo


They wanted junkies

They wanted Attica

They wanted Kent State

They wanted war in Indochina


yeah


It had to be the CIA and the Mafia and the FBI


Multinational capitalists

Strong armed squads

Private detective agencies for the oh so very rich

And their armies and navies and their air force bombing planes


It had to be capitalism

The vortex of this rage

This competition

Man to man


The horses head in a capitalists' bed

The Cuban turf

It rumbles in hitmen

And gang wars across oceans


Bombing Cambodia settled the score when Soviet pilots

manned Egyptian fighter planes


Chiles' red democracy

Bumped off with White House pots and pans


A warning to Mediterranean governments


The secret police have been embraced for decades


The NKPD and CIA keep each other's secrets

The OGBU and DIA never hit their own

The KGB and the FBI are one mind


Brute force and full of money

Brute force, world-wide, and full of money

Brute force, world-wide, and full of money

Brute force, world-wide, and full of money

Brute force, world-wide, and full of money


It had to be rich and it had to be powerful

They had to murder in Indochina 2000000

They had to murder in Czechoslovakia

They had to murder in Chile

They had to murder in Russia


And they had to murder in America.

// Intro (Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos) //

[Intro]
[Zack:] Hey check this out right about now....

I wanna introduce a brotha...who came all the way outta here 

from Long Island, New york. And he's one of the fathers of 

revolutionary music in our time period. He was a huge influence

on us and we wanna bring him out right now. So check it out, we 

got a man by the name of Chuck D, from Public Enemy. Yeah.
[Chuck D:] Wassup, wassup! Zack: Yo....
[x5]

[Chuck D:] "I got a letter from the government

The other day

I opened and read it

It said they were suckers

They wanted me for their army or whatever

Picture me given' a damn - I said never

Here is a land that never gave a damn

About a brother like me and myself

Because they never did

I wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute...

It occured to me

The suckers had authority

Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell

How long has it been?

They got me sittin' in the state pen

I gotta get out - but that thought was thought before

I contemplated a plan on the cell floor

I'm not a fugitive on the run

But a brother like me begun - to be another one

Public enemy servin' time - they drew the line y'all

To criticize me for some crime - never the less

They could not understand that I'm a Black man

And I could never be a veteran

On the strength, the situation's unreal

I got a raw deal, so I'm goin' for the steel"

// No Shelter //

The main attraction - distraction
got ya number than nnumber than numb 
Empty ya pockets son; they got you thinkin that
What ya need is what they sellin
Make you think that buyin is rebellin
From the theaters to malls on every shore
Tha thin line between entertainment and war
The frontline is everywhere, there be no shelter here 
Speilberg the nightmare works so push it far
Amistad was a whip, the truth was feathered and tarred
Memory erased, burned and scarred
Trade in ya history for a VCR

Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture - Americana 
Chained to the dream they got ya searchin for 
Tha thin line between entertainment and war

There be no shelter here 
Tha frontline is everywhere

Hospitals not profit full
Yet market bulls got pockets full
To advertise some hip disguise
View tha world from American eyes
Tha poor adore keep fiendin for more 
Tha thin line between entertainment and war
They fix the need, develop the taste
Buy their products or get laid to waste
Coca-Cola is back in the veins of Saigon 
And Rambo too, he got a dope pair of Nikes on
And Godzilla pure muthafuckin filler
To keep ya eyes off the real killer 

Cinema, simulated life, ill drama
Fourth Reich culture - Americana 
Chained to the dream they got ya searchin for 
Tha thin line between entertainment and war

American eyes, American eyes....
View the world from American eyes
Bury the past, rob us blind
And leave nothin behind 

Just stare
Relive the nightmare.

// People Of The Sun (Original Version) //

Yea...the bastard son is in

swimming in a sea of funk

clear tha lane, I'm gonna have to dunk ya

Up and down like a donut in a caffenated drink

so make a scene I take it to the brink

Check around the style of it

If the price is right ill take you on a trip

In my old school 62

Shoes are white and blue somethin you never want to step to

Space My Bassline

Feel the earthquakin

when you shortside my automatic

White Folks came and they try to steal my name

But now I got a gun

This is for the people of the sun

[CHORUS]


I'm not a silent one

I'm a defiant one

Never the normal one 

Cause i'm the bastard son

Shift away before the sky sees blood

And that was just away from mother earth

I'm tearin' up a big fat chunk of the funk

led a lead I gotta dunk Never smoke a skunk

On the set, humble, shove anotha punta

I got a product six shooter 

Face my bassline

Feel the earth quakin'

Cause when they short side my mathematics

You take it from my culture

White Folks came and they try to steal my name

But now I got a gun

This is for the people of the sun

[CHORUS]

// Producer //

Earth shares what Earth receives

And now only blood brings life

A tiller bring life, producer bring life

Protector bring life, soiled hands bring life


The tree of democracy shall be watered by the blood of revolution

So go plant a seed, go plant a seed for harvest

Go plant a seed for harvest producer


Producer, producer, producer, producer

Producer, producer, producer, producer

Producer, producer, producer, producer

Producer, producer, producer, producer

Producer, producer, producer, producer

Producer, producer


And it all shall fall by the grace of the people and

It all shall fall by the grace of the people and

It all shall fall by the grace of the people and

It all shall fall by the grace of the people and

It all shall fall

It all shall fall


I first met you and the ideas you uphold while incarserated A victim of a social experiment

Eventually addicted to your eight hour injections of hypocracy and arrogance and greed

Forced to sit with coplicity in front of my executioners

As they blugeoned me with their so called superior values and demanded my submission 

I bacame an indentured servant in a factory

Where I myself was the product

Whos' useful quality was to protect their palaces

Every word uttered from their mouths strangeled me


So that every thought I express

Shall sow the seed for the noose around their necks

And set fire to their homes


And every word uttered from their mouths strangeled me

So that every thought I express

Shall sow the seed for the noose around their necks

And set fire to their homes


And set fire to their homes

And set fire to their homes

And set fire to their homes

And set fire to their homes


And it all shall fall by the grace of the people and

It all shall fall by the grace of the people and

It all shall fall by the grace of the people and

It all shall fall by the grace of the people and

It all shall fall by the grace of the people and

It all shall fall

// Sound Of Da Police //

Woop-woop! 

That's the sound of da police!

Woop-woop! 

That's the sound of the beast!

[Verse One:]


Stand clear! Don man a-talk

You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk Watch out! We run New York

Police man come, we bust him out the park

I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act You claim I'm sellin' crack

But you be doin' that

I'd rather say "see ya" Cause I would never be ya

Be a officer? You WICKED overseer!

Ya hotshot, wanna get props and be a saviour

First show a little respect, change your behavior

Change your attitude, change your plan

There could never really be justice on stolen land

Are you really for peace and equality?

Or when my car is hooked up, you know you wanna follow me

Your laws are minimal

Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal

This has got to cease

Cause we be getting HYPED to the sound of da police!

[Chorus]

[Verse Two:]


Now here's a likkle truth

Open up your eye 

While you're checking out the boom-bap, check the exercise

Take the word "overseer," like a sample

Repeat it very quickly in a crew for example

Overseer 

Overseer 

Overseer 

Overseer 

Officer, Officer, Officer, Officer!

Yeah, officer from overseer

You need a little clarity?

Check the similarity!

The overseer rode around the plantation

The officer is off patroling all the nation

The overseer could stop you what you're doing

The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing

The overseer had the right to get ill

And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill

The officer has the right to arrest

And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest!

(Woop!) They both ride horses

After 400 years, I've _got_ no choices!

The police them have a little gun

So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one

(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day

Just so they can run the light and be upon their way

[Chorus]

[Verse Three:]


Check out the message in a rough stylee

The real criminals are the C-O-P

You check for undercover and the one PD

But just a mere Black man, them want check me

Them check out me car for it shine like the sun

But them jealous or them vexed cause them can't afford one

Black people still slaves up til today

But the Black police officer nah see it that way

Him want a salary 

Him want it 

So he put on a badge and kill people for it

My grandfather had to deal with the cops

My great-grandfather dealt with the cops

My GREAT grandfather had to deal with the cops

And then my great, great, great, great... when it's gonna stop?!

[Chorus]

// Testify (Original Version) //

Here we go

9-5 is the blood for your sweat

Pay the landlord, he's taking your blood for the rent

Yo

The balance dead so a bullet's what I get

When my Mao-Say-Tung gets offensive like Tet

The whip snapped my back

My spine cracked

For tobacco

I'm the Marlboro man

Can I make London bridges fall

If they do me like Mumia Abu-Jamal

Nobody move

Nobody move

86 Philly pigs drive a whole city block

And I'm campin' like Hampton

Read the word of the innocent

Yet death row is locked

Capitol-i-ism

check the wrong rhythm

And so they say let Saigons be Saigons

But wait a Ho-Chi-minute


Waste the day 'cause the night brings a hearse

Make a move and plead the fifth,

Ya can't plead the first


Are you ready to testify?

Get ready to testify

Are you ready to testify?

Get ready to testify


The revolutionary aesthetic

Black leather, beret and powder blue

However meanacing this human form on the outside looks

Without revolutionary action

It's ever so translucent


I stand admist grandeous gestures

Postures and platforms of romanticism

Creating more noise than answers

Creating more noise than the sirens

That keep our children crouched in corners


I sit and watch us do the blind man's dance

And I can't stand the smell of false composure

So i take a Ho-Chi minute to meditate

And think

And then tune to the word of Jose Matin


Doing is the best way of saying

Doing is the best way of saying

Doing is the best way of saying

Doing is the best way of saying


9-5 is the blood for your sweat

Pay the landlord, he's taking your blood for the rent Yo

The balance dead so a bullet's what I get

When my Mao-Say-Tung gets effective like tet

The whip snap my back

My spine crack

Front to back

Ohhh what a Marlboro man

Can I make London bridges fall

If they do me like Mumia Abu-Jamal

Nobody move

Nobody move

86 Philly pigs drive a whole city block

And I'm campin' like Hampton

Read the word of the innocent

Yet death row is locked

Capitol-i-ism

check the wrong rhythm

And so they say let Saigons be Saigons

But wait a Ho-Chi-minute

Waste the day 'cause the night brings a hearse

Make a move and plead the fifth,

Ya can't plead the first


Are you ready to testify?

Get ready to testify

Are you ready to testify?

Get ready to testify

c'mon


Doing is the best way of saying

Doing is the best way of saying

// The Narrows //

Drop it

Hey

Ugh


Try to crack

And some will react

Vocal snap so trap 

I'm trying to rap


Those who try to subdue 

the truth

lose their condition 

were labelled inactive


Being 91

the twentieth century

Brooklyn is a magnum in the bottle of kerosiene


flame ignites into the black

sending fright

thought you could read minds 

and words and insight


Backin' the explosion on stage

guns fear

Frances Fanon

presence of war


Using my brain

Until the power is obtained

Using my strength to gain

A struggle for rage


But I

Choose another tune to uplift

Yeah, you know my anger is a gift

a gift to expect the test we all must face

Hah,

Out my face


Release the reason

Allow the pain

The actors change

But the plays the same


C'mon

In the narrows

In the narrows

In the narrows


Some are the holders of power

But the style will [ ? ? ] shower 

Trying to like brothers about the structure itself

Pay only motivates and creates more hate


State to state

I set it straight

I investigate

Debate, the ?? who brought me lessons


At the oppression I react with aggression

Yo 

My section after section


No need for repressing

Just take a mic 

and a rap another session


No need for guessing

Yeah

And that shit that your stressin'


Release the reason

Allow the pain

The actors change

But the plays the same


Release the reason

Allow the pain

The actors change

But the plays the same


C'mon


In the narrows

In the narrows

In the narrows


Ugh!


UGH!


I'm on the mic

Stepping up to sucka's

while were drumming out the style

and I do it with a smile


When I put punks on trial

Taking 'em back again

Yeah the name of the comprehender


The style I drop is going on and on

To the punks to recognize the style

Andrealize

That I'm not no Punk Kid

Just stepping up for the mic hit


Ugh!

In the narrows


In the narrows

In the narrows

In the narrows


Ugh!

// Zapata's Blood //

Zapata's blood

Wasn't spilt in vain

So now the most poor wage war

To reclaim their name


Zapata's blood


Wasn't spilt in vain


So now the most poor wage war

To reclaim their terrain


On January 1st , 1994

The indigenous farmers of Southern Mexico

Declared war on an unjust

and illegitimate government


Out of the debt of the most wild, the most poor

Came a just arm struggle

for democracy, justice, and liberty

And it won't stop until that 65 year old dictatorship, 

the Partido Revolucionario Institucional

(Institutional Revolutionary Party) is buried in the 

ground

and the people's voice is heard once again


Yeah


So check it out:

On January 1st, of 94 they became known as 

the Zapatista movement

And they have a saying, and I want you all to 

sing along with me real quick.

It goes something like this

It goes everything for everyone...

and nothing for ourselves.

Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.

Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.

Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.

Yeah, sing that shit...

Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.

Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.

Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves.

Everything for everyone, and nothing for ourselves...
