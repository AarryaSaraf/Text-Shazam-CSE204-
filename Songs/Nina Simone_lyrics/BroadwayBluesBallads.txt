// Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood //

Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Doncha know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Ya know sometimes baby I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

Cause I love you
Oh baby
I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?

Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard
So please don't let me be misunderstood

// Night Song //

Summer
Not a bit of breeze
Neon signs are shining
Through the tired trees

Lovers
Walking to and fro
Every one has someon
And a place to go

Now listen
Hear the clouds go past
They don't even see me
Flying by so fast

Moving
Going who knows where
Only thing I know is
I'm not going there

Where do you go
When you feel that your brain is on fire?
Where do you go
When you don't even know what it is you desire

Listen
Laughter everywhere
Hear it
Life is in the air

And night comes
And the town awakes
Sound of children calling
And the squeal of brakes

Music
By the lonely sung
When you can't help wondering
Where do I belong?

// The Laziest Gal In Town //

It's not 'cause I wouldn't,
It's not 'cause I shouldn't,
And, you know though well, it's not 'cause I couldn't,
It's simply because I'm the laziest gal in town.

My poor heart is achin'
To bring home the bacon,
And if I find myself alone and forsaken,
It's simply because I'm the laziest gal in town.

Though I'm more than willing to learn
How these gals get so much extra money to burn,
Every little proposition I just turn it down,
'Way down,

It's not 'cause I wouldn't,
It's not 'cause I shouldn't, honey,
And, you know, that it's not 'cause I couldn't,
It's simply because I'm the laziest, laziest gal in town.

// Something Wonderful //

This is a man who thinks with his heart
His heart is not always wise
This is a man who stumbles and falls
But this is a man who tries
This is a man you'll forgive and forgive
And help and protect as long as you live

He will not always say
What you would have him say
But now and then he'll say something wonderful

The thoughtless things he'll do
Will hurt and worry you
Then all at once he'll do something wonderful
He has a thousand dreams that won't come true
You know that he believes in them
And that's enough for you

You'll always go along with
Defend him when he's wrong
And tell him when he's strong
He is wonderful
He'll always need your love
And so you'll get your love
'Cause a man who needs your love
Can be wonderful

// Don't Take All Night //

Don't take all night
To tell me that you love me
Don't take all night
To tell me you care

Don't you know I have the right
To know if you want me
Tell me now
Take my love
Forever to share

Don't take all night
Now don't keep me waiting
Well I like to know
The way that you feel

Oh don't take all night
I'm anxious to know dear
Let your love
With a kiss
Let it be sealed

Everyday
I love you more and more
This is the moment
That I've been waiting for

Daddy please, don't take all night
To tell me that you love me
Oh don't take all night
To tell me you care

Daddy please, don't take all night
I want you to hold me
Tell me now
Take my love
Forever to share

Daddy take my love
Take it now
Forever to share

// Nobody //

When life seems full of clouds and rain
I am filled with an awkward pain
Who soothes my achin', thumpin' brain?
- Nobody

When winter comes with snow and sleet
I'm so tired with cold feet
Who says: "Here's two bits Nina honey, go and eat?"
- Nobody

I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time
And until I get me somethin', yes, from somebody, sometime
Well, I don't intend to do nothin'
For no body, no time

Now when winter comes all cool and clear
My friends they see me comin' near
Who says: "Come on in child and have a beer?"
- Nobody

When all day long things go amiss
I go home to find some bliss
Who hands to me a glowing kiss?
- Nobody

I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
I ain't never got nothin' from no body - no time
And until I get me somethin', from somebody, sometime
I don't intend to do nothin'
For no body, nobody, no time, no time, no body, no time!

// I Am Blessed //

I who never had much I now have a treasure
A love too great to measure
I am blessed with happiness
And I'm done with loneliness

I who walked all alone 
Not really knowing
Till now just where I was going
I am blessed because this day
You came show me the way

Till now I was like a grain of sand
Lost on a lonely beach
Yes till now I could never understand
That this was within my reach

I who cried to the moon see only sunshine
Because darling you're mine
I am blessed with wealth untold
A love worth more than gold

// Of This I'm Sure //

I can't explain the fallin' rain
Say when the sun will shine again
I only know I want your kiss
Of this I'm sure

I never miss the moon's bright light
The magic of a starry night
It's just your lovin' arms I miss
Of this I'm sure

(Come back, come back,
Come back to my heart)
Oh oh, what good am I without you?
(I cry, and cry
'Cause we are apart)
I need you so,
Darling I do

Uncertain as some things can be
I know that you belong to me
I also know that we'll endure
Of this I'm sure

// Our Love (Will See Us Through) //

Anytime things go wrong
Baby we'll still get along
Cos we have each other
And our love will se us through

If some tears come our way
The sun skips a day
We still have each other
And our love will se us through

Just as long as you and I
Have a little tender kiss to share
There's no doubt at all that we'll get by
Grey skies will all turn bare

So when some clouds bring the rain
We've no cause to complain
Cos we have each other
And our love will se us through
Cos we have each other
And our love will se us through

// How Can I //

How can I help but love you
Help but want you
Help but need you
How can I hide this feeling
Feeling as I do

How can I make you see me
Make you to me
Take you to me
And I
How can I pic the secret
It's so plan to see

Be mine, please be mine, my darling
I can't ask nothing more
Be mine, please be mine, my darling
You're the one I adore

How can I help but love you
Help but want you
Help but need you
I have one wish
I'm wishing only love me too

How can I make you see me
Wake you to me
Take you to me and I
How can I keep the secret
It's so plan to see

So how can I help but love you
Help but want you
Help but need you
I have one wish
I'm wishing only love me too

How can I help but love you
How can I help but want you
How can I help but need you

// The Last Rose Of Summer //

'Tis the last rose of summer
Left blooming all alone
All her lovely companions
Are faded and gone

No flower of her kindred
No rose bud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes
Or give sigh for sigh

So soon may I follow
When friendships decay
And from love's shining circle
The gems drop away

When true hearts lie withered
And fond ones are flown
Oh! who would inhabit
This bleak world alone

// A Monster //

What's as big as a mountain and grows bigger everyday
Until it's taller than the sky
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie

What can change happy lovers into hurt and lonely souls
Just as we are, you and I
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie

Gossip can be an ugly thing, tearing love like I was apart
How could you believe I was untrue, when I love you with all my heart

Darling, one silly rumor coming from two liar lips
Made you wanna say goodbye
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie

What's as big as a mountain and grows bigger everyday
Until its taller than the sky
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie

What can change happy lovers into hurt and lonely souls
Just as we are, you and I
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie

Gossip can be an ugly thing, tearing love like I was apart
How could you believe I was untrue, when I love you with all my heart

Darling, one silly rumor coming from two liar lips
Made you wanna say goodbye
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie
