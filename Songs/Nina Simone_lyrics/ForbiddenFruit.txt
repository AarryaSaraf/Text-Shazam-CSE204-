// Rags And Old Iron //

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
I heard that old rag man now making his rounds
He came right to my alley lord with sorrowful sounds
Crying rags old iron and pulling his cart
Ask him how much he'd give me for my broken heart

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
So I asked that old rag man how much he would pay
For a heart that was broken baby when you went away
For a burnt out old love light that no longer beams
And a couple of slightly used second hand dreams

Rags old iron rags old iron

All he was buying was just rags and old iron
For those big empty promises you used to make
For those memories of you that are no longer sweet
I wish he could haul them off down the street

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
When love doesn't last tell me what is it worth
It was once mama's most precious possession on earth
When I asked that old rag man if he'd like to buy
He just shook his head and continued to cry

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
Rags old iron rags old iron
Rags old iron rags old iron rags old iron

// No Good Man //

No good man
Loving on a no good plan never treats me as he should
And that ain't good he's always bringing me down
He's no saint Heaven knows that's what he ain't
Spends his money foolishly and not on me
I'm the one who gets the run around

I ought to hate him but still I love him so
Cos I require love that's made of fire
And in his arms I find always get that kind
No good man
Ever since the world began there's been other folks like me
Born to be in love with a no good man

I ought to hate him but still I love him so
Cos you see I require love that's made of fire
And in his arms I find always get that kind
No good man
Ever since the world began there's been other folks like me
Born to be in love with a no good man

// I Love To Love //

I love to love
What plenty of love each night
Say I love to love it's so good it can't be right

I don't want a man with Harvard of Yale degrees
Because I don't intend to play information please
Just squeeze me or baby you gonna freeze me
You've got to Romeo me make feel like I'm SalomÃ¨

Don't want a man to sit there and talk too much
I just need a guy with a Frank Sinatra touch
Cos I'm tired of all the times I felt
Like a piece of butter about to melt
I wanna press your lips against mine
I wanna feel lightning tickle my spine
I want what there can never to be too much of
Yes I love to love

Just squeeze me or baby you gonna freeze me
When the iron is hot strike it
Hold me I like it I like it

Don't want a man to sit there and talk too much
I just need me a guy with a Frank Sinatra touch
Just build me an earthquake as fast as you can
I got me a hobby and my hobby is men
He's what I intend to build my collection of
Because I love to love

// Where Can I Go Without You //

I went to London town to clear up my mind
Then on to Paris for the fun I could find
I found I couldn't leave my memories behind
Where can I go without you

Tried seeing Singapore that wouldn't do
So I went Vienna but I found you THERE too
Even in Switzerland your memory came through
Where can I go without you

So I wanted to travel and I wanted romance
So I just took off and chased my rainbow across the sea
But it's all over I'm tired of faces and QUAINT old places
Baby if you won't be there with me

Back on the boat again farewell to France
So long West Germany it hasn't got a chance
I'll trade the sides I've seen for one loving glance
Where can I go without you

// Memphis In June //

Memphis in June
A shade veranda under Sunday blue sky
Memphis in June
And my cousin Miranda she's making a blueberry pie

I can see the clock outside a ticking and a tocking
Everything so peaceful and dandy
I can see my grandmama 'cross the street still a rocking
Watching all the neighbours go by oh my

Memphis in June
Sweet oleander blowing perfume in the air everywhere
Up jumps the moon to make it so much grander
It's paradise honey take my advice honey
Cos there's nothing loke old Memphis in June

// Forbidden Fruit //

Eve and Adam had a garden everything was great
Till one day a boy says pardon Miss my name is snake
See that apple over yonder if you'll take a bite
You and Adam both are bound to have some fun tonight
Go on and eat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
Go ahead and taste it you don't wanna waste it

The Lord had said in the beginning everything is free
Except that apple that leads to sinning so let that apple be
But Eve got tempted so she tried it and as all chicks do
Teaser her man till he decided he'd just try some too
Go on and eat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
Go ahead and bite it I bet you'd be delighted

I hate to tell you all what followed the Lord was most upset
Saw them making love and hollered what have you to add
And when they made a full confession the Lord said hm I see
I guess I'll have to teach you a lesson about not minding me
Go on and eat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
You're all indebted now you gonna get it

The Lord made Eve Adam's madam have his kids and all
Placed some labour laws on Adam and he made the snake to fall
Ever since the days of Eden folks been sinful my
Nowadays they're even eating apples in their pie
Go on and eat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
Go ahead and taste it you don't wanna waste it
Oh go ahead and bite it I bet you'd be delighted
You always did it now you'll gonna get it
Forbidden fruit
