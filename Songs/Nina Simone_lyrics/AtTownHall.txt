// Exactly Like You //

I know why I waited
Know why I've been blue
I've been waiting each day
For someone exactly like you

Why should I spend some money
On a show or two
When nobody sings these love songs
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I wanna give this world to you
You make me understand
These foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
And schemes I'm scheming

Now I know why my mama
She taught me to be true
She knew just around the corner
Was somebody like you

You make me feel so grand
I wanna give this world to you
Baby you make me understand
These foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
And schemes I'm scheming

Now I know why my mama
She taught me to be true
She knew just around the corner
Yes she knew just around the corner
Was somebody like you

// You Can Have Him //

I don't want him you can have him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him you can have him
I'm giving him the sack
And he can go right back where he came from
I'm afraid I never loved him
Sweetie he'd be better off with you
I could never make him happy

All I ever wanted to do was
Run my fingers through his curly locks
Mend his underwear and darn his socks
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he's read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
Mornings after when he's had a little too much

Kiss him gently when he cuddles near
And give him babies one for every year

So you see that I don't want him you can have him
You can have him cos I don't want him
Because he's not the man for me
Then I'd close the window while he soundly slept
Then I'd raid the icebox where the food is kept
I'd fix the breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee some apricot juice and some buttered toast
Oh oh then I'd go out and buy the papers
And when they've been read spend the balance of the day in bed

So you see that I don't want him you can have him
You can have him cos I don't want him because he's not my man
I don't want him you can have him
You can have him I don't want him
You can have him I don't want him
Cos he's not the man for me

// Summertime //

Summertime and the livin's easy
Fish are jumpin', and the cotton is high
Oh, yo' daddy's rich and yo' ma is good lookin'
So hush, little baby, don' yo' cry

One of these mornin's you goin' to rise and singin'
Then you'll spread yo' wings an' you'll take the sky
But till that mornin', there's a-nothin' can harm you
With daddy and mammy standin' by

// Cotton Eyed Joe //

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from? Where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from? Where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?

He came to town like a midwinter storm
He rode through the fields so handsome and strong
His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun
But all he had come for was having some fun

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from? Where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?

He brought disaster wherever he went
The hearts of the girls was to hell broken sent
They all ran away so nobody would know
And left only men cause of Cotton-Eye Joe

If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from? Where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?

// Fine And Mellow //

My man he don't love me he treats me oh so mean
My man he don't love me he treats me oh so mean
He's the meanest man that I've ever see

My baby wears high peg pants stripes are really yellow
Baby wears high peg pants stripes area really yellow
When he starts into love me he's so fine and mellow

Love will make you drink and gamble make you stay out all night long
Love will make you drink and gamble make you stay out all night long
Love will make you do things that you know is wrong

Do right baby if you stay home every day
I'll do right baby if you stay home every day
You're so mean and evil I know you're gonna drive me away

Why did he leave me why did he have to go
Why did he leave me why did he have to go
Went off and left me baby I loved him so

I'll be a good wife to you if it means anything to you
I'll stay home every night and I'll love you
And kiss you every night and one of these days
If you're good to me honey one of these day
If God is good to me I'll bring you a little burny

Come back to me baby try me one more time
Cos without your loving I swear I'm gonna lose my mind
