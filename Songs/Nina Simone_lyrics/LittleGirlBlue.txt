// He Needs Me //

He needs me
He doesn't know it,
But he needs me
And so no matter where he goes,
Though he doesn't care
He knows that I'm there

He needs me
I oughta leave him,
But he needs me
I know that I ain't very bright
Just to tag along
Oh, but right or wrong
I'm his... And I'm here

And I'm gonna be his friend,
Or his lover
Cause my one ambition is
To wake him and make him discover that 
He needs me
I've got to follow where he leads me
Or else he'll never know 
That I need him
Just as he needs me

// He's Got The Whole World In His Hands //

He's got the whole world in His hands
He's got the whole world in His hands
He's got the whole world in His hands
He's got the whole world in His hands

He's got the fish of the sea in His hands
He's got the birds of the air in His hands
He's got the fish of the sea in His hands
He's got the whole world in His hands

He's got the gamblin' man in His hands
He's got the sinner man in His hands
He's got the gamblin' man in His hands
He's got the whole world in His hands

He's got the little bitsy baby in His hands
He's got the little bitsy baby in His hands
He's got the little bitsy baby in His hands
He's got the whole world in His hands

He's got everybody here in His hands
He's got you and me, brother, in His hands
He's got everybody here in His hands
He's got the whole world...
He's got the whole world in His hands

// For All We Know //

For all we know
We may never meet again
Before we go
Make this moment live again
We won't say goodbye
Until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand
And my heart will be in it

For all we know
This might only be a dream
We come and we go
Like the ripples, like the ripples in the stream
So baby, love me, love me tonight
Tomorrow was made for some
Oh, but tomorrow
But tomorrow may never, never come
For all we know
Yes, tomorrow may never, never come
For all we know
