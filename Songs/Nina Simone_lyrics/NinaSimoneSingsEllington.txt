// Do Nothing Till You Hear From Me //

Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head

Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
Don't you know, I haven't a chance

True I've been seen with somebody new
But does that mean that I'm been untrue? 
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And others arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear from me
And baby you never will

[Original lyrics]

Someone told someone and someone told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much
Sine ev'ry one spreads the story
With his own little personal touch

Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head

Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance

True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue? 
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memroy
And others arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear from me
And you never will

// I Got It Bad And That Ain't Good //

My baby never treats me sweet and gentle the way he should;
I got it bad and that ain't good!

My poor heart is sentimental not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls aroun'
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out
He don't love me like I love him nobody could
I got it bad and that ain't good!

Like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
And the things I tell my pillow no woman should
I got it bad and that ain't good!
Tho folks with good intentions tell me to save my tears
I'm glad I'm mad about him I can't live without him
Lord above me make him love me the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good!

[Original lyrics]

The poets say that all who love are blind
But I'm in love and I know what time it is!
The Good Book says "Go seek and ye shall find"
Well, I have sought and my what a climb it is!
My life is just like the weather
It changes with the hours
When he's near I'm fair and warmer
When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers;
in emotion, like the ocean it's either sink or swim
When a woman loves a man like I love him.
Never treats me sweet and gentle the way he should;
I got it bad and that ain't good!

My poor heart is sentimental not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls aroun'
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out
He don't love me like I love him nobody could
I got it bad and that ain't good!

Like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
And the things I tell my pillow no woman should
I got it bad and that ain't good!
Tho folks with good intentions tell me to save my tears
I'm glad I'm mad about him I can't live without him
Lord above me make him love me the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good!

// Hey, Buddy Bolden //

Buddy bolden tune up
Blowing horn was his game
Born with a silver trumpet in his mouth
He played the horn before he talked
Born on the after beat
He patted his foot before walked

When buddy bolden tuned up you could hear him clean

Clean across the river clean across the river
He woke up the working people and kept the easy living
Call on buddy bolden call him buddy bolden

Watch it he's calling his flock now
He's calling his flock now here they come
Call him buddy bolden he's calling his flock now
Here they come here they come
Come on buddy bolden here they come

// Merry Mending //

Merry mending to you
Merry mending merry mending
May your convalescence be fun as you chat about prevention

Merry mending merry mending
Think you're lucky you are the one
To get all of that attention
Forget about your pills forget about your ills
Forget about the bills
Get up get out get well again
Merry mending health and happiness blending

Merry mending to you

Merry mending merry mending
May your convalescence be fun as you chat about prevention
Merry mending merry mending
Think you're lucky you are the one
To get all of that attention

Forget about your pills forget about your ills
Forget about the bills
Get up get out get well again
Merry mending merry mending merry mending
Merry mending merry mending to you

// Something To Live For //

I want something to live for
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouldn't I give for
Someone who'd take my life and make it seem
Gay as they say it ought to be

Why can't I have love like that brought to me?
My eye is watching the noon crowds
Searching the promenades seeking a clue
To the one who will someday be my
Something to live for
Something to live for
Something to live for

// You Better Know It //

I belong to you and I know I show it
You belong to me baby you'd better know it
Give me all your love sugar spice and sweet honey
Don't you ever quit

Not for love or money I'd do most anything
Just to amuse you
But there's nothing that I wouldn't do
Thought that I would ever lose you
When I play the game I can't afford to blow it
Cos I play for keeps you'd better know it

Yes I'd do most anything just to amuse you
But there's nothing that I wouldn't do
If I ever thought I'd lose you
When I play the game I can't afford to blow it
Cos I play for keeps you better know it

// I Like The Sunrise //

I like the sunrise cos it brings a new day
I like the new day it brings new hope they say
I like the sunrise blazing in the new sky
Nighttime's so weary and oh so am I

Every evening I wish upon a star
That my brand new tomorrow isn't very far
When that heavy blue curtain on night
Is high in the sky way out of sight

I like the sunrise so heavenly to see
I like the sunrise and I hope it likes poor me

// Solitude //

In my solitude you haunt me
With reveries of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me
With memories that never die

I sit in my chair
Filled with despair
Nobody could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm praying
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

[Original lyrics]

In my solitude you haunt me
With reveries of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me
With memories that never die

I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm praying
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

// Satin Doll //

Cigarette holder which wigs me
Over her shoulder, she digs me.
Out cattin' that satin doll.

Baby, shall we go out skippin ?
Careful, amigo, you're flippin',
Speaks Latin that satin doll.

She's nobody's fool so I'm playing it cool as can be.
I'll give it a whirl but I ain't for no girl catching me,
Swich-e-rooney.

Telephone numbers well you know,
Doing my rhumbas with uno
And that'n my satin doll.
