// I Put A Spell On You //

I put a spell on you
'Cause you're mine

You better stop the things you do
I ain't lyin'
No I ain't lyin'

You know I can't stand it
You're runnin' around
You know better daddy
I can't stand it cause you put me down
Yeah, Yeah

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
You're mine

I love ya
I love you
I love you
I love you anyhow
And I don't care
If you don't want me
I'm yours right now

You hear me
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

// Tomorrow Is My Turn //

Though some may reach for the stars
Others will end behind bars
What the future has in store no one ever knows before
Yet we would all like the right to find the key to success
That elusive ray of light that will lead to happiness
Tomorrow is my turn
No more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn
When my luck is returning
All these years I've been learning to save fingers from burning
Tomorrow is my turn
No more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn to receive without giving
Make life worth living
Now it's my life I'm living
My only concern for tomorrow is my turn
Now the summer is gone, there's another to come
You can't stop years from drifting by even if you want to try
Though time may help you forget all that has happened before
But honey it's too late to regret what is gone will be no more
Tomorrow is my turn
When my luck is returning
All these years I've been learning to save fingers from burning
Tomorrow is my turn
No more doubts no more fears
Tomorrow is my turn to receive without giving
Make life worth living
Now it's my life I'm living
My only concern for tomorrow is my turn

// Ne Me Quitte Pas //

Ne me quitte pas
Il faut oublier
Tout peut s'oublier
Qui s'enfuit dÃ©jÃ 
Oublier le temps
Des malentendus
Et le temps perdu
A savoir comment
Oublier ces heures
Qui tuaient parfois
A coups de pourquoi
Le coeur du bonheur

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Moi je t'offrirai
Des perles de pluie
Venues de pays
Ou il ne pleut pas
Je creuserai la terre
Jusqu'aprÃ¨s ma mort
Pour couvrir ton corps
D'or et de lumiÃ¨re
Je ferai un domaine
Ou l'amour sera roi
Ou l'amour sera loi
Ou tu seras reine

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Je t'inventerai
Des mots insensÃ©s
Que tu comprendras
Je te parlerai
De ces amants-lÃ 
Qui ont vu deux fois
Leurs coeurs s'embraser
Je te raconterai
L'histoire de ce roi
Mort de n'avoir pas
Pu te rencontrer

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

On a vu souvent
Rejaillir le feu
De l'ancien volcan
Qu'on croyait trop vieux
Il est para'?t-il
Des terres brulÃ©es
Donnant plus de blÃ©
Qu'un meilleur avril
Et quand vient le soir
Pour qu'un ciel flamboie
Le rouge et le noir
Ne s'Ã©pousent-ils pas

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Ne me quitte pas
Je ne vais plus pleurer
Je ne vais plus parler
Je me cacherai lÃ 
A te regarder
Danser et sourire
Et Ã  t'Ã©couter
Chanter et puis rire
Laisse-moi devenir
L'ombre de ton ombre
L'ombre de ta main
L'ombre de ton chien

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

// Marriage Is For Old Folks //

I love dancing
Crazy romancing
Fellas advancing constantly

Marriage is for old folks
Old folks, not for me!
One husband
One wife
Whaddya got?
Two people sentenced for life!

I love singing
Good healthy clinging
Quietly bringing on a spree

Marriage is for old folks
Cold folks!
One married he
One married she
Whaddya got?
Two people watchin' tv!

I'm not ready
To quit bein' free
And I'm not willing
To stop being me
I've gotta sing my song
Why should I belong
To some guy who says
That I'm wrong?

Doo doo dooo
De doo de doo
De-doo de-doo
Doo doo doo
Dooo

Cookin' dinner
Lookin' no thinner
Gray elbows and
A sudsy sea

Marriage is for old folks
Cold folks,
And it's not for me!
One husband
One wife
Whaddya got?
Two people sentenced for life!

I'm exploding
With youth and with zest
Who needs corroding
In some vulture's nest?
I've gotta fly my wings
Go places, do things
My freedom bell's really
Gonna ring!

Doo doo dooo....[etc.]

I've been through years
Too many blue years
Now I want New Year's every eve

Marriage is for old folks
Marriage is for cold folks
One husband
One wife
Whaddya got?
Two people sentenced for life

Marriage is for old folks
Marriage is for cold folks
Not for me
Can't you see
Marriage ain't for me

// July Tree //

True love seed in the autumn ground.
True love seed in the autumn ground.
Where will it be found?

True love deep in the winter white snow.
True love deep in the winter white snow.
How long will it take to grow?

You know true love buds in the April air. 
You know true love buds in the April air. 
Was there ever a bud so fair?

True love blooms for the world to see.
True love blooms for the world to see.
Blooms high upon the July tree.

// Gimme Some //

Loving is the thing I crave
For your love I'd be your slave
Gimme some
I can't stand it no longer
Gimme some

Don't be bashful, come over here
Whisper some sweet words in my ear
Gimme some
Gimme some
I can't wait eight days
Gimme some

Come on over here and fill my cup
Love me so hard I can't stand up
Gimme some
Gimme some
Don't you know I love you?
Gimme some

Just a closer walk would be
Doo wah diddy daddy one two three
Gimme some
Gimme some
You know I have to have it
Gimme some

I know that you wanna do what's right
Just come on and love me all night
And gimme some
I tell ya, I want some
I can't stand it no longer
Gimme some

I like cornbread nice and yellow
So I want you to be my fellow
Gimme some
Gimme some
Don't you know I love you?
Gimme some

One of these mornings, just about dawn
You'll be working on my lawn
Gimme some
Gimme some
I can't stand it no longer
Gimme some

I declare to my main
You gonna drive me stone insane
Gimme some
Gimme some
I can't wait eight days
Gimme some

I like fried chicken, you know it's true
But there's no sweeter meat in the world than you
I want some day to be your wife
So you can thrill me the rest of your life
So stop stalling
Finish your drink and let's get falling
Gimme some
Gimme some
I can't stand it no longer
Why don't you gimme some?

// Feeling Good //

Birds flyin' high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me
Yeah, it's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me, ooooooooh
And I'm feelin' good

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River runnin' free, you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me
And I'm feelin' good

Dragonfly out in the sun, you know what I mean, don't you know
Butterflies all havin' fun, you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done: that's what I mean
And this old world is a new world and a bold world for me

Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
Oh, freedom is mine, and I know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life for me

And I'm feelin'... good

// One September Day //

Years, they will come and go
Sometimes the tears will flow
Some of my memories will fade
But I'll always remember that one September day

I used to reminisce
'Cause I thought that love was bliss
How did they know it would go astray
It began and it ended on one September day

We met by chance
As people often do
But it blossomed, yes it blossomed
Into something I never knew

Now... It is in the past
They said it would never last
I'll not forget the moment back
Nor hot May or December
Nor June or November
But one September day

// Beautiful Land //

Red is the color of a lot of lollipops,
Orange is any orange on a tree.
Yellow's the color of a bag of lemon drops,
Green is a piece of seaweed in the sea.

Blue is the color of the sky in summertime
Indigo is a Siamese cat's eyes.
Violet's the color of a flow'r in wintertime.
These are the colors of the rainbow skies.

There is a beautiful land
Where all your dreams come true;
It's all tied up in a rainbow,
All shiny and new;
But it's not easy to find
No matter what you do.

It's not on top of a mountain
Or beneath the deep blue sea
Or in London zoo or in Timbuktoo,
Or in Timbuckthree.

And if you travelled the world
From China to Peru,
There's no beautiful land on the chart.
An explorer could not begin
To discover its origin
For the beautiful land is in your heart.

// You've Got To Learn //

You've got to learn to show a happy face
Although you're full of misery
You mustn't show a trace of sadness
Never look for sympathy

You've got to learn although it's very hard
The way of pocketing your pride
Sometimes face humiliation
While you were burning up inside
Facing reality is often hard to do
When it seems happiness is gone

You've got to learn to hide your tears
And tell your heart life must go on

You've got to learn to leave the table
When love's no longer being served
To show everybody that you're able
To leave without saying a word

You've got to learn to hide your sorrow
And go on living as before
What good is thinking of tomorrow
Who knows what it may have in store

You've got to learn to be much stronger
At times your head must rule your heart

You've got to learn from hard experience
And listen to advice
And sometimes pay the price
And learn to live with a broken heart
