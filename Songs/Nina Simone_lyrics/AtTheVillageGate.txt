// Children Go Where I Send You //

Children go where I send you,
How shall I send you?
I'm gonna send you one by one,
One for the little biddy baby, was born, born, born in Bethlehem.

Children go where I send you,
How shall I send you?
I'm gonna send you two by two,
Two for Paul and Silas,
One for the little biddy baby, was born, born, born in Bethlehem.

Children go where I send you,
How shall I send you?
I'm gonna send you four by four,
Four for the poor that stood at the door,
Three for the Hebrew children,
Two for Paul and Silas,
One for the little biddy baby, was born, born, born in Bethlehem.

Children go where I send you,
How shall I send you?
I'm gonna send you six by six,
Six for the six that couldn't get fixed,
Five for the gospel preacher,
Four for the poor that stood at the door,
Three for the Hebrew children,
Two for Paul and Silas,
One for the little biddy baby, was born, born, born in Bethlehem.

Children go where I send you,
How shall I send you?
I'm gonna send you eight by eight,
Eight for the eight that stood at the gate,
Seven for the seven came down from heaven,
Six for the six that couldn't get fixed,
Five for the gospel preacher,
Four for the poor that stood at the door,
Three for the Hebrew children,
Two for Paul and Silas,
One for the little biddy baby, one for the little biddy baby,
One for the little biddy baby. He was born, born,......
He was born in Bethlehem.

// Just In Time //

Let's go

Just in time you found me just in time
Before you came my time was running low
I was lost them losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed nowhere to go
Now you're here now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear I've found my way
Your love came just in time you found me just in time
And changed my lonely nights that lucky day

Just in time

Before you came my time was running low oh baby
I was lost them losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed nowhere to go
Now you're here now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear I've found my way
Your love came just in time you've found me just in time
And changed my lonely nights and changed my lonely nights
And changed my lonely nights and changed my lonely nights
And changed my lonely nights that lucky day

// He Was Too Good To Me //

He was too good to me how can I get along now
So close he stood to me
Everything is all messed up and wrong now
My baby would have brought me the sun
Cos making me smile that was his fun

When I was mean to him he didn't say go away now
You see I was his queen to him
Who's gonna make me gay now
It's only natural that I'm blue
Cos my baby was too good to be true

I said he was too good to me how am I ever get along now
So close he stood to me
Everything's all messed up and wrong now
He would have brought me the sun and the moon
Cos anytime I left him it was too soon

When I was mean to him he didn't say go away now
I was his queen to him who's gonna make me gay now
It's only natural said it's only natural that I'm so blue
He was too good to be true

// House Of The Rising Sun //

There is a house in New Orleans
Call it the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin
Of many a poor girl
And me, oh Lord, I'm one

If I'd listened what my mama said
Be at home today
Bein' so young
And foolish, my Lord
Let a gambler lead me astray

My mother was a tailor
Sews new blue jeans
My sweetheart's is a drunkarad, Lord
Drinks down in New Orleans

Go tell my baby sister
Never do what I have done
Shun that house in New Orleans
They call it the Rising Sun

Goin' back to New Orleans
Race is almost run
Goin' back to spend my life
Beneath, beneath, beneath, oh Lord
Beneath, oh now
Beneath the rising, rising sun
Now, now

You come on bye

// Bye Bye Blackbird //

Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, singing low,
Bye-bye Blackbird.
Where somebody waits for me, sugar's sweet, so is she,
Bye-bye Blackbird.
No one here can love and understand me.
Oh -- what hard-luck stories they all hand me.
Make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight,
Blackbird, Bye-bye.

// Brown Baby //

Brown Baby Brown Baby
As you grow up I want you to drink from the plenty cup
I want you to stand up tall and proud
And I want you to speak up clear and loud
Brown Baby Brown Baby Brown Baby

As years go by I want you to go with your head up high
I want you to live by the justice code
And I want you to walk down freedom's road
You little Brown Baby

Lie away sleeping lie away safe in my arms
Till your daddy and you mama protect you
And keep you safe from harm
Brown Baby

It makes me glad you gonna have things that I never had
When out of men's heart all hate is hurled
Sweetie you gonna live in a better world
Brown Baby Brown Baby Brown Baby

// If He Changed My Name //

I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name
I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name
I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name
And He told me that I would go hungry if He changed my name
And He told me that I would go hungry if He changed my name
And He told me that I would go hungry if He changed my name

But I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name
I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name
So I told Him it would be alright and the world would hate me
That I would go hungry if He changed my name
