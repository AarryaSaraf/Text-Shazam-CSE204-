// Include Me Out //

It is really very simple
Just a single pulse, repeated at a regular interval

Mmm, hmm
Don't include me out, no
Don't include me out

One time for the records and the hits
Two for your money-maker, shake, boom
Three times for the lucky and the dead

One time for the sorry and safe
Two for the beggar and his company
Three times for the sinner and the saint

Yeah, bow down all you wicked and the vain
Bow to the miracle, the em, na, na
Three times and the devil will be gone

One time for the fire, bring it on
Two for the boogie, gotta bang the beat
Three times for the ladies, show me some love

Talking 'bout everyone, every day, all day

And if your world should fall apart
There's plenty room inside my heart
Just don't include me out
Don't include me out

And if your world should fall apart
I still got room inside my heart
Just don't include me out
Don't include me out, d-d-don't include me out

All hail to the mamas who hold it down
Hail to the pillar of the family
This one's for the granny, take a bow

One time for the crazy and the bent
Come on, all you trannies click your heels for me
All praise the fugeses and the gems

Talking 'bout everyone, every day, all day, oh yeah

And if your world should fall apart
There's plenty room inside my heart
Just don't include me out
Just don't include me out

And if your world should fall apart
I still got room inside my heart
Just don't include me out
Don't include me out, d-d-don't include me out

Can I get a beat, beat for all of my watchamacallits
Doing whatever and with whoever they like?
Can I get a beat, beat for all of my watchamacallits
Doing whatever and with whoever they like?

Can I get a bam, bam for all of my watchamacallits
Doing whatever and with whoever they like?
Can I get a bam, bam for all of my watchamacallits
Doing whatever and with whoever they like?

I'm talking about everyone, every day, all day, hey

And if your world should fall apart
There's plenty room inside my heart
Just don't include me out
Don't include me out

And if your world should fall apart
I still got room inside my heart
Just don't include me out
Don't include me out

And if your world should fall apart
There's plenty room inside my heart
Just don't include me out, hey, hey

And if your world should fall apart
I still got room inside my heart, yeah
Just don't include me out, hey

// Criminal Intent //

Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent
Conspiracy to engage in lewd and indecent acts and events
I'mma wind it, grind it, oh my, I'mma say it again
Somebody alert the authorities, she's got criminal intent

Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent
Conspiracy to engage in lewd and indecent acts and events
I'mma wind it, grind it, oh my, I'mma say it again

Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent

- Will the defendant please rise? State your full name for the record.
- Robyn
- Do you wish to say anything before the sentence is imposed?
- I do your Honor!

You know, from time to time
I need to get down
Unwind and just bump and grind
Get my shot on, have some fun
A little dirty never hurt anyone
I admit, I can get somewhat X-rated on the floor
But your Honor, how's that something you get incarcerated for?

I-I-I done nothing that's wrong 
?? something that's frowned upon
I object most strongly Judge, they played my song

Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent
Conspiracy to engage in lewd and indecent acts and events
I'mma wind it, grind it, oh my, I'mma say it again
Somebody alert the authorities, she's got criminal intent

Conspiracy to engage in lewd and indecent acts and events
I'mma wind it, grind it, oh my, I'mma say it again
Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent

Y-yo-yo Judge, may the record reflect the fact 
I don't have any priors
Besides, would you pardon me 
For being inappropriately attired?
But yo, listen, them cuffs down at county
Totally ripped up my pantyhose
And some snitch punk at legal aid
Stole my voucher for court clothes

I done nothing that's wrong 
?? something that's frowned upon
I object most strongly Judge, they played my song

Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent
Conspiracy to engage in lewd and indecent acts and events
I'mma wind it, grind it, oh my, I'mma say it again
Somebody alert the authorities, she's got criminal intent

Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent
Conspiracy to engage in lewd and indecent acts and events
I'mma wind it, grind it, oh my, I'mma say it again
Somebody alert the authorities, I got criminal intent
Somebody alert the authorities, she's got criminal intent

// Indestructible (Acoustic Version) //

I'm going backwards through time at the speed of light
I'm yours, you're mine, two satellites
Not alone
No, we're not alone

A freeze-frame of your eye in the strobelight
Sweat dripping down from your brow, hold tight 
Don't let go
Don't you let me go

And I never was smart with love
I let the bad ones in and the good ones go
But I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible
Your love is ultra magnetic and it's taking over
This is hardcore
And I'm indestructible

Hands up in the air like we don't care
We're shooting deep into space
And the lasers split the dark
Cut right through the dark

It's just us, we ignore the crowd dancing
Fall to the floor
Beats in my heart
Put your hands on my heart

And I never was smart with love
I let the bad ones in and the good ones go
But I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible
Your love is ultra magnetic and it's taking over
This is hardcore
Ooh and I'm gonna love you like
Like I've never been hurt before
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible
Your love is ultra magnetic and it's taking over
This is hardcore
And I'm indestructible

And I never was smart with love
I let the bad ones in and the good ones go
But I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible
Your love is ultra magnetic and it's taking over
This is hardcore
Ooh and I'm gonna love you like
Like I've never been hurt before
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible
Your love is ultra magnetic and it's taking over
This is hardcore
And I'm indestructible
