// Bumpy Ride //

Sometimes life can be a bumpy ride
Sometimes it feels like you're drivin with covered eyes
And you listen to your friend who's in the car by your side
They say they've got your map, what if your friends are tellin' lies
So listen to your heart 'cause you can't see no roadsigns
You don't know where to stop or to turn
Everyone goes through it I'm in the middle of mine
And I try to remember it's the only way to learn

Hold on (you've gotta hold on)
Hold on (you've gotta hold on)
You gotta stay real true to yourself in the game
Of becomin' a woman where the rules never stay the same
Remember who you are, who made you and who's keepin' you here
Who's makin' you not duck for problems in fear?
People in your way, dogs and bitches
Who's lickin' your ass? liers and snitches

Even though it's a bumpy ride
Keep your head above the waterline
Keep focused and you'll make it through
Keep on rollin' is what you've got to do
Even though it's a bumpy ride don't you slip and don't you slide
Love will be there in the end when you come around that bend

You've gotta keep your flow smooth, never hesitate
Never stop believin' always keepin' the faith
But always be critical never naive
'Cause if you can be that there's so much more you can achieve
Maybe then when you're grown up satisfied and strong
Maybe then you will be happy, happy that you held on

// In My Heart //

Hope things will get better 'cause that's what I need
I think about the good times that we had and now I see that you are
living in two different places and I don't think it's gonna be a change

But I'm never gonna leave it I'm always gonna keep it In my heart
In my heart
I'll keep it all together
In my heart
I know it's gonna be better
In my heart

You said that it should never be like this and
when I was a little child I never had this on my mind
But now it is like it is and I don't think it's gonna be a change

But I'm never gonna leave it I'm always gonna keep it 
In my heart

// You've Got That Something //

Look at me here I am
I'm givin all of my lovin' every day of my life to you
All you see can be yours
If you show me you love me just one little hint will do

And I know,
I give too much and there is much I sacrifice
But I've got all the reasons
when I look into your eyes
I know I love you even though I shouldn't and you should know
I've tried to stop
You've got that somethin'
Gives me that feelin'
Gives me that freaky vibe

You've got that something that makes me feel so fine
Makes it worth waiting until the day that you will be mine, all mine

You decide take your time
I just want you to know that I'll always be here for you
My friends keep tellin' me:
you've gotta let go!
They say I'm too good for you and maybe that is true

But I just keep on lovin' you the way I did before
And you should know I've tried to stop

// Do You Know (What It Takes) //

Don't you know i can see what you're doing
Runnin' around with your cheap talk, cheap talk
What I need is a man who can do me right

If you got what I need I can gurarantee
To return all the love that you've given to me
But I've got to be sure that you'll always be around
Do you know what it takes to love me?
Do you know what it takes to do me right?
Do you know what it takes to love me baby?

Heaven knows in my time I've been lonely
Feelin' my love echo in my mind, in my mind yeah
A never satisfied girl's what they call me
But I just can't keep goin' on livin' lies

Guarantee unto me, you won't let me down
There's so much I can give but it's buried so deep
I just got to be sure that you always will be around

[Chorus]
do you know what it takes?
do you know what it takes?

Don't waste my time with your lies (yeah baby, i gotta know)
You got to prove that you will always be around
I'll give you everything
Boy will you do the same for me?
Will you do anything? 
I gotta know what will it be

// The Last Time //

Ever since I was a little girl even younger than I am now
I always felt good about you in a special way, I don't know how
And we always seem to find our way back to the love that we are sharing
And every time we say it's over I can't forget your sweet loving
After every time we break up, thing always turn out the same
I tell myself that I have shaped up, but I am still a part of this game

You always seem to come back into my life
When I thought I've forgotten you, you always show up
It's drivin' me crazy, it's got me going wild
And I don't know if this is ever gonna stop
You always seem to come back into my world
And this time I hope we're staying on track
'Cause I don't wanna be anybodyelses girl
I hope this is the last time you'll ever come back

I want you back 'cause you're a good man,
The kinda' man who loves you all through the night
And though it never turns like I planned
Somehow it feels so right
So this time, boy don't turn away
'Cause you'll always have a place in my heart
And I swear I'm goona love 'til the day,
'til the day that death do us part

[Chorus]

I don't have the strength to be proud anymore
I want it all to be just like before
I guess what I'm really tryin' to say
Is that I want you to come back,
Come back to stay 'cause I love you
('cause I really love you)
want to (I just want to)
get closer (get much closer)
than ever (more than ever)
'Cause I love you

[Chorus]

Yes I do, yes I do I do love you baby and I'm telling you know
When I'm down you bring me up and when I'm up you bring me down
So what am I supposed to do when all I want is to get back with you baby

// Just Another Girlfriend //

You say that I am all a gilr like me could be
And you say that all that you need you find in me
And that feels good, 'cause that is all a gilr wnats to hear
But are you telling me this baby just to keep me near
My soul and all of my heart I'll give to you
But my trust is something that I put in few
So baby if you want it all you've got to show me
That what you say you're gonna do is something that will become reality

So will you love me, let's say one year from now
And if you will baby can you tell me how
'Cause I wanna know, I'm not gonna play the fool again
I wanna be more than just another girlfriend
Just another girlfriend, just another girlfriend

So this is it, this is where your choice has to be made
'Cause I ain't goin' no further if I don't know what's ahead
But don't get me wrong, all I want is you to stay with me baby

Won't you stay with me baby

But not here, not where we are today

[Chorus]

Will you leave or will you stay, will you stay another day

// Don't Want You Back //

I know what can I expect you're just a man
But even 
But even a man should understand his woman

I don't want you back, I don't want you back here with me
I don't wanna get back, get back to what we used to be
I just wanna be free, free to be what I wanna be
I just wanna be me, I just wanna be me and only me

This girl had so many things she couldn't tell you
This girl had so many things she couldn't show you so

[Chorus]

So it's time for me to show 
It's time to let you know
This is for real 
And this is what I feel

[Chorus]

I don't wanna see your face again
And I don't need to hear your lies
I don't even wanna hear your name
Oh boy, you better recognize

// Do You Really Want Me (Show Respect) //

Boy listen to me careful now
Cause this is something every man should know
Oh this is a lesson about how
You treat your girl right just let it show
That you love her that you need her say
That you want her in every way
You gotta show your girl a little respect
Or you won't get nothing back but hate
It's those little things that mean so much
You gotta treat her right 
Or get out of her sight

Do you really want me am I really special
Taking is so easy boys giving is unusual
If you really want me don't make we wait too long
Respect and love is the key just listen to my song

Safe is how she wants to feel
Protect her with all you've got
Oh she wants to know your love's for real
And be a good lover make her hot
Then she'll do everything love you day and night
She'll do anything just do her right
It's those little things that mean so much
You gotta treat her right 
Or get out of her sight

[Chorus]

Girls don't give up, give your best
No part time job, no time to rest
Let him know what's up before
so he can give you more and more

// How //

Often things in life don't make sense
It's when the timing is right thins can happen
And I feel that my clock is tickin'
So if you wanna get with me, you better start thinkin'

How I want to be loved by you baby
How I want to feel your sweet love for real

Cause I'm the bomb and soon I'll explode
Do you know which buttons to push, do you know my code
Cause if you do I'm gonna take our destiny
And turn it into freaky reality

(That's how)
How I know, well it's my female intuition
And something tells me that it's time for some action
Cause I've been waiting for so long for the right moment
to let you know 
That my desire is too string to let you go
(How)

[Chorus]

You know it's all about timing 
That rules everything
And tonight the time is right it is our night tonight
Take your time don't let me stop you 
Do what you wanna do
As long as, as long as you will affect me with the things you do
Tonight's the night the time is right it is our time tonight

// Here We Go //

I couldn't wait another minute when I had you here again
'Cause baby it's been more than minutes since we were more than friends
All of this time I thought,
I thought that nothing had changed 
But it's all the same

Here we go
Once again you and I are more than friends
Here we go
Makin' love again
Here we go
Even though we both know this is not right
Here we go
Makin' love another night

Makin' lopve to you is easy 
It's something that I missed so long
Baby the way that you please me it feels so right It can't be wring
All of this time I thougt,
I thought that nothing had changed 
But it's all the same

// Where Did Our Love Go //

Thoughts about you and me 
Thinkin' about what we used to be
Love was strong so were we 
Until one day it all went wrong

A new body a new face
But no one good enough to fill your empty space
Baby where did our love go
I'm thinkin' about you and me now
Baby both you and I should know
We should know by now
Warming heat coolin' shade 
Whatever I needed I found in the love we made
Maybe this was meant to be 
Miss and reminisce of something close to exctasy

But I still hope that you feel our love inside the way I do

[Chorus]

Thoughts about you and me 
Thinkin' about what used to be

But there ain't much them clothes will hide

[Chorus]

A dedication to this special time of the year
And a celebration 'cause finally I am here
Spreadin' love to all of my family and my friends
To that special one I'm thinkin' of and to my audience
I'm lettin' everything else go, have only one thing on my mind tonight
I am gonna let you know my flow I'm gonna make you feel alright

// I Wish //

Do you know what I think all these nights when I can't sleep, sleep at all
Slowly I close my eyes 
My thoughts they fly away to you no matter what I do
I wish I could turn back time 
Back to the time when you were mine I wish

I wish the day, the day you went away never happened baby
I wish the stars, the stars in heaven would come down to me
So I could give them to you
Tell me then would you be lovin' me like I wish

And it's so hard when you love someone this much
But you just don't how, how to love him the right way
If you could see, what you've done to me
What you've done to my heart, what you've done to my soul baby
All of my mind and all of my body then you should know
Why I can't let go and baby I

I wish the day, the day you went away never happened baby
I wish the stars. the stars in heaven would come down to me
So I could give them to you
Tell me then would you be lovin' me like I wish

I don't know what you want me to do 
To prove my love is real for you
I don't know what you want me do say baby 
There is no if's or maybe's
All I want is you 'cause baby you are my only wish
My only wish

// Show Me Love //

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Always been told that I've got too much pride
Too independent to have you by my side
Then my heart said, all of you will see
Just won't live for someone until he lives for me
Never thought I would find love so sweet
Never thought I would meet someone like you
Well now I've found you and I tell you no lie
This love I've got for you
Could take me 'round the world
Now show me love

Show me love, show me life
Baby show me what it's all about
You're the one that I ever needed
Show me love and what it's all about, alright

Don't waste this love I wanna give to you
Tell me what you got, show me what you can do
Show me love, show me everything
I know you've got potential
So baby let me in and show me love
