// Should Have Known //

I should have seen it coming, I should have fucking known
How could I let you play me, I don't even know

I should have seen it coming, I should have fucking known
How could I let you play me, I don't even know

I'm such a fool I can't believe I let you in my life
you broke the rules but I should have known you do it all the time
Though we were cool but then again who am I kidding
It's every players favourite crime, to make you feel
Like it's all real, when it's a lie
And I should have known

I should have known, my family they never did pretend
My mama felt, she never liked you neither did my friends
and when you blamed it all on me I should have known
that's what liers always try to do, it wasn't me, 
It was you, you're the fool
And i should have known

If your heart was simple just like mine is, then you would know just how it feels
When someone takes advantage of your kindness, you think you're never gonna heal
If your soul was deep just like mine is, then you would known not to give up
Keep my faith even through the darkness, yeah I still believe in love.

I still believe...

// Konichiwa Bitches //

You wanna rumble in my jungle
I'll take you on
Stampede your rumpa
And send you home
You wanna rumble in space
I put my laser on stun
And on the north pole I'll ice you son

You wanna thrilla in mah nilla
You'll be killer bee stung
Wanna taste of vanilla
Better watch your tongue

'Cause I'll hammer your toe
Like a pediatrician
Saw you in half
Like I'm a magician
Tear you down
Like I'm in demolition
Count you out
Like a mathematician

I'm so very hot that when I rob your mansion
You ain't call the cops, you call the firestation

'Cause my flavor's so sweet
You'll be zoom, zoom, zoom
Don't even get me started on my bada-boom-booms
One left, one right - thats how I organize 'em
You know I fill my cups no need to supersize em'
Right now you probably thinking "how she get in them jeans"
Well, I'm gifted all natural and burstin the seams

Konichiwa bitches
Konichiwa bitches

Don't I look tasty like a french bon-bon
Even more sweeter than a cherry bomb
Coming with the postman like I'm a mailbomb
Comin' in your mouth
Makes you say yum-yum

Hit the gong-gong
Bring the sumos on
I'm 'a kick ass all the way to Hong Kong
Make the balls bounce like a game of ping-pong
Konichiwa bitches from Beijing to Siagon
Got nothing on me
'Cause you know you're so bum
Dom-didi-dom-didididi-dom-dom
Check the scenario
I'm 'a bust your ear drum
And leave you heads ringing
With a ring-a-ding-dong
Busy on the mic
Since the day I was what? (Born)
Check out my style it's the rock of what? (Mo')
Shine is on me like a dog on what? (Bone)
Fight the power
Put myself on the throne

You know when shit is getting heavy
Like it's weights a ton
I will run you down like a marathon
Tape you up good
Put you in the trunk
See you next Tuesday
You is a punk

It's a simple fact
That you can't seem to handle me
No matter how you act with them
You can't handle me
You gotta make me feel you got my back

Narcissistic psycho-freaking
Boot-licking Nazi creep and
You can't handle me

// Bum Like You //

You're always up to no good
Your fingers in my cookie jar
You can have my checkbook, visa and my mastercard too
Ain't no price too high for what you do

You could be my dog
I would post your bailbonds when cash was tight
We could fall in love

My new favourite thing to do
Is wasting my time on a bum like you

We could fall in love
I could be the apple in your eye

// Be Mine! //

It's a good thing tears never show in the pouring rain
As if a good thing ever could make up for all the pain
There'll be no last chance, I promise to never mess it up again
Just a sweet pain of watching your back as you walk
As I'm watching you walk away
And now you're gone, there's like an echo in my head
And I remember every word you said

It's a cool thing you'll never know all the ways I tried
It's a hard thing faking a smile when I feel like I'm falling apart inside
And now you're gone, there's like an echo in my head
And I remember every word you said

And you never were and you never will be mine
No, you never were and you never will be mine

For the first time, there is no mercy in your eyes
And the cold wind's hitting my face and you're gone
And you're walking away
And I am helpless sometimes, wishing's just no good
'Cause you don't see me like I wish you would

'Cause you never were and you never will be mine
No, you never were and you never will be mine

There's a moment to seize every time that we meet
But you always keep passing me by
No, you never were and you never will be mine

I saw you at the station
You had your arm around what's-her-name
She had on that scarf I gave you
You got down to tie her laces

'Cause you never were and you never will be mine
(You looked happy and that's great)
No, you never were and you never will be mine
(I just miss you, that's all)

'Cause you never were and you never will be mine
No, you never were and you never will be mine

There's a moment to seize every time that we meet
But you have always keep passing me by
No, you never were and you never will be mine
'Cause you never were and you never will be mine
No, you never were and you never will be mine

There's a moment to seize every time that we meet
But you have always keep passing me by
No, you never were and you never will be mine

// With Every Heartbeat //

Maybe we could make it all right
We could make it better sometime
Maybe we could make it happen, baby

We could keep trying but things will never change

So I don't look back
Still I'm dying with every step I take
But I don't look back

Just a little, little bit better
Good enough to waste some time
Tell me, would it make you happy, baby

We could keep trying but things will never change

So I don't look back
Still I'm dying with every step I take
But I don't look back

So I don't look back
Still I'm dying with every step I take
But I don't look back

Who's that girl?

Good girls don't say no or ask you why

When the buried and hidden
Can be seen by the blind

You're right,
Some words are just unspoken
So right,
Then it all just falls apart

The day I break your heart

I caught my reflection
In the corner of your eye
You said "Don't even ask the question,
And I won't tell the lie"
Where there's no accusation
There's no need for denial
And if you hadn't heard that whisper
There'd be no tear to wipe from your eye

You're right,
Some words are best unspoken
So right,
Then it all just falls apart

The day I break your heart

Never took no advice
Not the foolish, not the wise
All the truth that I needed
Was right there in your smile
Every prophecy written
Of what's going to be
All beginnings and endings, 
They're about you and me

You're right,
Some words are best unspoken
So right,
Until it all just falls apart
You?re right,
Some words are best unspoken
So right,
Then it all just falls apart

The day I break your heart
