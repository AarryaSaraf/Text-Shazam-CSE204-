// Play //

Um'Um'
Some people live their lives by the book,
Some people are too scared to even look,
Some people don't even really care,
Nooo,
I'm not a woman yet still not a child,
So what am I suppose to do with my life,
It doesn't fit me anymore,
Not yet,
Right now, 

[Chorus]
When too many of us has forgot, 
What our lives is all about, 
Care too much about what other people say,
Ah yeah, 
But your heart will never grow old,
And your mind will never ever get bigger if you remember how to play,

Some people seek other's extreme too scared of their own inner hive,
Some people never asked themselves why,
No, No,
I will never try to hide behind myself,
I will never try to be somebody else,
It wouldn't do me any good,
Not yet,
Right now,

[Chorus]

Yeah'
Say yeah, 
Say yeah, 
Say yeah, 
Say yeah' yeah' yeah' yeah' yeah'

[Chorus]

Say, 
If you remember how to play,
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

// My Only Reason //

My only reason...

[CHORUS]
Love is my only reason and
Love can make you do crazy things
And that's why my only explanation is
'Cause I love you and that's all
Boy, I love you and that's all

My friends think I'm crazy
'Cause I'm running around with you
But they don't know you like I do, do, and I do
You're so impossible, so unpridictable
I know they don't have to tell me
But my heart's made up my mind, yeah
It's so irrational, so irresponsable 
It may not make sense
But it's making me feel so deep

[Chorus (x1)]

Yeah, yeah, heh

3.30 in the morning, and you're asking why I'm still here
(Why are you, why are you still here?)
Say, my life will probably be safer 
If you disappeared, yeah, don't disappear no, no
It's like a burning flame, that's stronger in the rain
I ask myself why I do this, over and over again
But even with your pain, I still can't walk away
Until every chance is gone, I'll be here holding on

[Chorus (x1)]

I don't even have a choice
These kinda situations have a life of their own
So why is it my love enough to explain
Why I'm acting this way
It's just that

[Chorus (x2)]

// Underneath The Heart //

I look into your eyes and see a place
Drifting like a satellite in space
Longing for a touch from someone who feels too much
And yet you hold up your walls
Before I've gotten close enough
But baby...
I can see the glimmer when you open up the door
And that crack of shinin' light keeps me coming back for more
To see

[CHORUS]
Underneath the heart, just before the lips,
Right behind the soul
What the mind has yet to know
The dreams you can't belive
Have the love I need to see
The place we have to start is right there
Underneath the heart

You live inside a castle made of sand
Where tears would only hurt the way it stands
I want to knock it down, start fresh on solid ground
But still you hide behind the truth like that's what life's all about
But baby...
Words can not distract true love when true love is really real
And the only way you'll know is if you show me how you feel

[Chorus (x1)]

You could spend your hole life in fear of pain
But love is only as deep as the risk you take
As the risk you take...

[Chorus (x1)]

// Electric //

Electric...

It's electric
It's a natural high
Electric
We don't always know why
Electric
Keep your ego aside
Well it's electric
It's a thing you can't deny

Blood boils without fire
Day come, day go
Without your desire
Disturbs the flow
When in denial
Night falls,
Falls to take you higher

It's electric
It's a natural high
Electric
We don't always know why
Electric
Keep your ego aside
Well it's electric
It's the thing you can't deny

A hard question
Needs an easy answer
Recognize, accept no need to censor
The harder the fall
The higher the bounce
Smooth moves
Keeps your buoyancy
Yeah, keeps your balance
Ohh ah

It's electric
It's a natural high
Electric
We don't always know why
Electric
Keep your ego aside
Well it's electric
It's the thing you can't deny

Ohh
Electric
Electric (can't deny that it's so)
Electric (it's electric)
Electric (oooh yeah yeah yeah)

In the eyes of a child
And the love that moves
The sun and the stars above
That race your heart
Somebody dies
And you have to cry
When you think this is it
And then some other
Shit just happens
Yeah, it just happens, happens
That's when

It's electric
It's a natural high
Electric
We don't always know why
Electric
Keep your ego aside
Well it's electric
It's the thing you can't deny

It's electric
It's a natural high
Electric
We don't always know why
Electric
Keep your ego aside
Well it's electric
It's the thing you can't deny

Electric....

// My Truth //

If I don't say what you want to hear 
If I don't dress in what you want me to wear
If I don't think the way you do
I can't help it 'cause that's my truth

If my humour makes you bored
If my religion isn't yours
If my maturity doesn't fit my youth
I can't help it 'cause that's my truth

[CHORUS]
See, the truth often hurts
But if it's honest it's always worth it
Can't deny that I'm subjective 
But no truth can be objective 
Even though it's universal 
It's always individual
My truth, your truth, his truth, her truth 
It doesn't matter as long as it's true

If my culture is something you don't know
It's unfamiliar and it's uncomfortable
I suggest you get to know my roots
Before you judge me 'cause that's my truth

If your opinion is different from mine
If where I say go is where you draw the line
Even if I may not agree
I will accept 'cause it's your truth and it sets you free

[Chorus (x1)]

Don't you loose your truth, for whatever it's worth
Don't you try to compromise with your own life

[Chorus (x2)]

[Chorus fade out]

// Main Thing //

We've got a thing,
We've got a thing,

I know right now it seems like I don't care
I know you think I never did
and it's so hard for me to prove that I'm still here
Because my actions contradict it, but if
Just you let me show you you're wrong 
I know you need time but you will see that if
If you let me show you you're wrong
Nothing can change what you mean to me, 'cause

[CHORUS]
We've got a thing, you're my main thing
You always were and you'll always be
We've got a thing, you're my main thing
And even when I'm gone you're still close to me

I'm always told that I forget too easily
That I`m too fast on moving on
And because of that this situation really scared me
But I feel my love for you is still strong
Just let me show you you're wrong
Nothing can destroy what you and I built 
I'll keep on holding on
You do your thing and I'll do mine, but still

[Chorus (x2)]

(Yeah. Babe. Alright. Alright)

Even though I did you wrong
(Let's work it out)
No one knows me like you do
(Let's work it out)
An everyday cliche I know
(Let's work it out)
Even though I'm not, my heart is true,
(Let's work it out)

(Let's work it out) [x2]
Let's work it out
(Let's work it out)
Oh yeah
(Let's work it out)
You know I want to
(Let's work it out)
I wanna work it out
(Let's work it out)
We've got a...
(Let's work it out)
We've got a...
(Let's work it out)

[Chorus (x2)]

// Healthy Love //

Have you ever had that strange feeling
Something is just not right
See lately he's been kind of changing into
Something you don't recognize
And you can't figure out why
All you want to do is fight 
You don't understand why
You're so sure it's all lies

When you give, he takes
When he gives, you turn away

[CHORUS]
Healthy love, something that I'm scared of
Feels like a conspiracy, why is he so nice to me
Healthy love, something I'm dreaming of
When he's gone he's all I want,
When he's gone I can't go on

[BRIDGE]
Healthy love (healthy love) hmm mmm (healthy love)
Healthy love
When he's gone I can't go on

Listen to yourself, his heart is pure
From what I hear he's trying
All you do is ask for more
How can a girl be sure, when her heart is sore
She can't afford to ignore
That tomorrow he might walk out the door

When you give, he takes
When he gives, you turn away

(Why you turn away?)

[Chorus (x1)]

[Bridge (x3)]

I don't know why
Why I can't be satisfied
I keep comin' back all the time
(Have you ever had a strange feeling?)
Why I can't trust him
(Healthy love)
I know
Don't worry baby
(Have you ever had a strange feeling?)
Use the one you love
Wait, that's a gift from him
(Have you ever had a strange feeling?)
Have you ever, have you ever
Have you ever had a strange feeling?
(Have you ever had a strange feeling?)
??
(If you give)
Why you rejectin' him?
(Healthy love)
You worryin' too much
(Have you ever had a strange feeling?)
??
(Healthy love)
Jus' like you
(Healthy love)

// Monday Morning //

[Whispered:]
(Friday, Saturday, Sunday)

I know you'll love me on a Friday night
Having fun is always easy with you
You're always down when everything's alright
And just like you I love to play,
But real love is everyday ain't that true
And I need your love the whole week through
Yeah, so

[CHORUS]
Will you still love me on a Monday morning
72 hours ain't that long
Will you still love me on Monday morning
Will you hold on after the weekend's gone

Saturday afternoon always comes too soon
'Cause I know there's only one more day
Sunday morning lovemaking when we lay in bed together
I could stay right here forever, could you
Could you love me the whole week through

[Chorus (x1)]

I could brake down and start crying on a Wednesday
Will you be around to be my shelter on a Thursday
Tuesday is coming don't be running away
Will you stay after the weekend's gone

[Chorus (x2)]

(Friday, Saturday, Sunday)
(Friday, Saturday, Sunday)

// Giving You Back //

In another time
Another life
In another situation I
Would have made you mine
Would have taken time
To make sure you'd be fine

I could feel you coming
I knew you would
And I never imagined
You'd be so good
And it hurts me so
Yo let you go
I want you to live
But I'm not all I wanna give

Right now, nothing can be right
Right now, nothing can be wrong
All I can do is keep believing

[CHORUS]
I'm giving you back, to the ocean
I'm giving you back, to the stars
I'm giving you back, to where you came from
(I..)
And I'm not forgetting who you are

With you in me
I was beautiful
Two months of joy
Before the impossible
Every second I
Long for the day
When you come back
Come back to stay
When the time is right
When there's no wrong
I'll be there for you
And I'll be strong
And I promise I'll be
All I can be 
I'm still open
If you still want me
Right now, nothing can be wrong,
Right now, nothing can be right
All I can do is keep believing

[Chorus (x1)]

You made me see a lot clearer
Heaven is not that far
One day I hope to be closer
To be as pure as I know that
I know that you are

[Chorus (x2)]

// 88 Days //

I light a candle in the morning 
To signify that your still on my mind
Darkness arrived without a warning 
It brought me down
But I know the world just keeps on turning

I wish that I could turn you on 
Like a switch in my kitchen 
Right before dawn
88 days seems so long
I believe in you and me
But it's so hard to trust
Something you just can't see, still I've got

[CHORUS]
88 days 'til the sun
And while you're gone
I've got so much work inside my heart to be done, I've got
88 days 'til the sun
I`ve got to get my spirit ready
For when the springtime comes
88 days 'til the sun

Zip up my thickest jacket 
I miss the green and the light you gave to me
Prepare to get my feet wet
Halogen's on bright when 2 pm is like 2 in the night, it ain't right
So what's the message in this song
That the pain doesn't mean that you can't carry on
Still 88 days seem so long
A meditation, a revelation
But it's so hard to trust
Something you just can't see, still I've got

[Chorus (x1)]

88 days 'til the sun comes around
(You got work, you got work, you got work to be done)
88 days 'til the sun comes around
(You got work, you got work, you got work to be done)
A meditation, a revelation
But it's so hard to trust
Something you just can't see, I've got

I've got 88 days, 88 days,
(You got work, you got work, you got work to be done)
I've got work, I've got work, I've got work to be done
(88 days 'til the sun)
88 days &lt;scat&gt;
Got to get my spirit ready for the springtime
Still I've got
(88 days 'til the sun)
[scat] springtime
(You got work, you got work, you got work to be done)
88 days 'til the springtime [fade out]

// Long Gone //

Long gone

Lips move, I can not hear
A single word, they're trying to say
A car crash, in front of me
But I'm not there, I'm everywhere, there

I shut my ears, a long time ago,
More comfortable, an' less vulnerable
I may o' miss a beat, be it so,
'Cause I hear my soul when I'm ...

[CHORUS]
Long gone
I'm not coming in today
I'm
Long gone
(Gone gone long)
Long gone
Next time
I come around
I promise
I won't let you down
But now
I'm long gone

I'm calling in sick today

Life's a sentence without tense
I'm hungry, give me some
Nothing never ever taste the same
No
Nothing ever changes
An' heaven knows that we've got hell to pay
I'll deal with that another day, 'cause now I'm

[Chorus (x1)]

Long gone
Long gone
Tears in the sky, but I'm flyin' higher
I'm long gone

Material's bordering on translucence
Perhaps to you it makes no sense
But I'm still OK to go
Inside of me the weather's beautiful, oh sandman

[Chorus (x1)]

Long gone
(Gone gone long)
Long gone
Next time
I come around
I promise
I will bring you some, 'til then

I'm long gone
I'm not coming in today
I'm
Long gone
(Gone gone long)
Long gone
Long gone
I'm not coming in today
I'm
Long gone
(Gone gone long)
Long gone
Long gone
I'm not coming in today

// Not On The Inside //

Isn't funny how some people never practice what the preach 
Isn't it sad that the strongest arm's still to short to reach
I watch him struggle with the fact that he's become what he said he'll never be
Hip parties and sunglasses at night they help him not to see
Can he see?

[CHORUS]
He's been high on a young girls vibe
Never alone on a saturday night
He's been a around the world, about a million times
But he's never been love, not on the inside

Isn't so messed up to be witness for a man who won't confess,
He won't confess, no
That he lost his truth, so caught up in believin' his own press
I watch him struggle with the fact that he relies on people that don't really care,
They don't care, no no no
You say that the buisness is a whack 
So baby why are you so deep in there

[Chorus (x1)]

One day it's gonna be to late
Or maybe it's to late, anyway
Famous has made you shameless
But not blameless
Just loveless, loveless, loveless

[Chorus (x2)]

// Universal Woman //

[VERSE 1]
She needs a place to rest her broken soul
Longs for a place where love is good
Her passion for him made her heart bold
She sacrificed her womanhood
Love made her brave but oh so vulnerable
But still she keeps on holding on
Some say she's weak, I say she's beautiful 
Her weakness prooves that she is strong

[CHORUS]
She's a universal woman
And she lives inside of you
She's a universal woman 
And love is all she can do

She lost her spirit when she lost her child
To what society demands 
And all the children and the mother cried
'Cause nature can not understand
But everytime she dies she's born again
True love never just goes away
Just like her sacrifice is not in vain
'Cause she will allways prevail

[Chorus (x1)]

[Verse 1 (x1)]

[Chorus (x1)]

Yeah love
Love
