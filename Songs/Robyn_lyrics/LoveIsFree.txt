// Lose Control //

Can't hold it in, can't shut it out
But you wanna know what they talk about
Want it so bad, but you can't let go, oh no
You don't like what you can't control
(If you can't control it, you just don't like it)

Hey, tell me all about your mistakes
Tell me 'bout the love and the pain
I know somebody hurt you some way
Hey, it's okay
You say you wanna play
But you keep on playing it safe
Lose it baby, don't be afraid
Hey, hey

Can't hold it in, can't shut it out
But you wanna know what they talk about
Want it so bad, but you can't let go, oh no
You don't like what you can't control
You don't like what you can't control
(If you can't control it, you just don't like it)
You don't like what you can't control
(If you can't control it, you just don't like it)

If you can't control you just don't like it
But you can't deny, try not to fight it
If you can't control you just don't like it
You don't like what you can't control
If you can't control you just don't like it
But you can't deny, try not to fight it
If you can't control you just don't like it
You don't like what you can't control
If you can't control you just don't like it
If you can't control you just don't like it

// Got To Work It Out //

Got to work it out!
Got to work it out!
Got to work it out!
Got to work it out!
Got to work it out!
Got to work it out!
Work it out, shake yo' body `til ya break and you got to…

Work it out. Work it out. You got to work it, c'mon!
Work it out. Shake your body, `til you break and you got to…
Work it out. Work it out. You got to work it, c'mon!
Work it out. Shake your body, `til you break and you got to

Shake it to the beat, never quit!
Make a fist an' pump it, like THIS!
Make a big scene, throw a fit!
Make it fit, fit, work with it!

Work it out, it's never too late
Shake it `til you disintegrate
Shake it like you're losing your faith!
Make it fit, fit, work with it!

Work it out. Work it out. You got to work it, c'mon!
Work it out. Shake your body, `til you break and you got to…
Work it out. Work it out. You got to work it, c'mon!
Work it out. Shake your body, `til you break and you got to…

Shake your body, just let it go!
Shake it like a baby bottle!
Make a mess, work your muscle
Make it fit, fit, work with it!

Work it out, c'mon make a stand!
Even if they don't understand…
It's between you an' ya fam
Make it fit, fit, work with it!

[Chorus]

Work it out. Work it out. You got to work it, c'mon!
Work it out. Shake your body, `til you break and you got to…
Work it out. Work it out. You got to work it, c'mon!
Work it out. Shake your body, `til you break and you got to…

[Verse 3]

Shake it to the beat, never quit!
Make a fist an' pump it, like THIS!
Make a big scene, throw a fit!
Make it fit, fit, work with it!

Work it out, c'mon make a stand!
Even if they don't understand…
It's between you an' ya fam
F-fu-fuck if they don't understand!

[Bridge (Alternate, repeat and fade)]

Shake ya' body till you do…got to work out!
GOT TO WORK IT OUT!
Shake yo' body, shake yo' body, baby! (Alternate, repeat and fade)

// Set Me Free //

I can see it
In my wildest dreams
It's a fever
It's an endless deep
It's a scary night
From the other side
It's my heart's desire
Got to set me
Got to set me
Got to set me
Got to set
To set, set, set, set, set

You know you got to set me free (Got to set me, got to set me)
You know you got to set me free (Got to set me, got to set me)
You know you got to set me free

Free your body
Free your body
Free your body
Free your body

I can feel it
In my shaking bones
It's a secret
Everybody knows it
It's a
It's the morning light
It's my heart's desire
Got to set me
Got to set me
Got to set me
Got to set
To set, set, set, set, set

You know you got to set me free (Got to set me, got to set me)
You know you got to set me free (Got to set me, got to set me)
You know you got to set me free (Got to set me, got to set me)
You know you got to set me free (Got to set me, got to set me)
(You know you've got to) You know you got to set me free
You know you got to set me free
You know you got to set me free

You know you have to set me free
You know you got to set me free
You know you got to set me free (You know you've got to)

// Tell You (Today) //

Tell you
Tell you
Tell you
Tell you
Tell you

Tell you
Tell you
Tell you
Tell you
Tell you
Tell you
Tell you

Walking down the street
I knew it was my chance
Chance today
New shoes on my feet
I thought that they could dance
Dance away

Makes me come alive, I remember
A look of sadness on your face
That was before
I want to tell you today
I want to tell you today
I want to tell you today
I want to tell you today

On my way to work
I said your name again
Again today

There was just a word
I only feel it when
When I say

Makes me come alive, I remember
A look of sadness on your face
That was before
I want to tell you today
I want to tell you today
I want to tell you today
I want to tell you today
