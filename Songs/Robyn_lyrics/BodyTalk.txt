// Fembot //

I've got some news for you

Fembots have feelings too

You split my heart in two

Now what you gonna do?


(Once you gone tech you ain't never going back)

I'm hi-tech, baby


Fresh out of box, the latest model

Generator running on full throttle

Can I get a fuel up? Hit the bottle

(Reboot)

I've got a lotta automatic booty applications

Got a CPU maxed out sensation

Looking for a droid to man my station

(Reboot)

Ro-ro-rock the nation (Rock it baby)


I've got some news for you

Fembots have feelings too

You split my heart in two

Now what you gonna do?


(Jag alskar dig)

My system's in mint condition

The power's up on my transistors

Working fine, no glitches

Plug me in and flip some switches

Pull up in docking position

Pop the hatch and hit ignition

Bu-bu-burn out baby

Ready for demolition


(Once you gone tech you ain't never going back)


My superbrain is all binary

Circuitry and mainframe, tin-foil hair

I'm sipping propane topped with a cherry

(Reboot)

In fact, I'm a very scientificly advanced hot mama

Artificially discreet, no drama

Digitaly chic titanium armor

(Reboot)

Ring the alarma


I've got some news for you

Fembots have feelings too, you know

You split my heart in two

Now what you gonna do?


Here we go

My system's in mint condition

The power's up on my transistors

Working fine, no glitches

Plug me in and flip some switches

Pull up in docking position

Pop the hatch and hit ignition

Bu-bu-burn out baby

Ready for demolition


(Once you gone tech you ain't never going back)

(Once you gone tech you ain't never going back)

(Once you gone tech you ain't never going back)

(Once you gone tech you ain't never going back)


Once you gone tech you're never ever going back

You've got to enter access code upon my back, on my neck

Initiating slut mode, all space cadets on deck

There's a calculator in my pocket, got you all in check


My system's in mint condition

The power's up on my transistors

Working fine, no glitches

Plug me in and flip some switches

Pull up in docking position

Pop the hatch and hit ignition

Bu-bu-burn out baby

Ready for demolition

My system's in mint condition

The power's up on my transistors

Working fine, no glitches

Plug me in and flip some switches

Pull up in docking position

Pop the hatch and hit ignition

Bu-bu-burn out baby

// Dancing On My Own //

Somebody said you got a new friend
Does she love you better than I can?
There's a big black sky over my town
I know where you're at, I bet she's around

Yeah, I know it's stupid
I just gotta see it for myself

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ohh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me, ohh
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooo
I keep dancing on my own
I keep dancing on my own

I'm just gonna dance all night
I'm all messed up, I'm so out of line
Stilettos and broken bottles
I'm spinning around in circles

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ohh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me, ohh
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooo
I keep dancing on my own
I keep dancing on my own

So far away but still so near
The lights go on, the music dies
But you don't see me standing here
I just came to say goodbye

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ohh
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooo
I keep dancing on my own
I keep dancing on my own

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ohh
I'm right over here, why can't you see me, ohh
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the girl you're taking home, ooo
I keep dancing on my own
I keep dancing on my own

I keep dancing on my own

// Dancehall Queen //

I take the bus to town

Sitting in the back and talk to noone

I got the high heels on

I go out dancing all by my own


People are pushing by

Somebody always tries to cut in line

Soon as I get inside

I loose myself in the blinding lights


Now what, your jaw has dropped

Until the music stop, you know

I still run this thing like a dancehall queen

I really don't want no hassle

Now what, your jaw has dropped

Until the music stop, you know

I still run this thing like a dancehall queen

I really don't want no hassle


I got them hypnotized

I get another shout out on the mic

Keep me at all you like

I came to dance, not to socialize


Rythm goes boom boom boom

Same thing drops with the

People all gather round

Rocking to the beat, the queen will be crowned


Now what, your jaw has dropped

Until the music stop, you know

I still run this thing like a dancehall queen

I really don't want no hassle

Now what, your jaw has dropped

Until the music stop, you know

I still run this thing like a dancehall queen

I really don't want no hassle


I go down low like she wow

She wow, wow, wow

One my hips will slow like she wow

She wow, wow, wow

I go down low like she wow

She wow, wow, wow

One my hips will slow like she wow

She wow, wow, wow


Now what, your jaw has dropped

Until the music stop, you know

I still run this thing like a dancehall queen

I really don't want no hassle

Now what, your jaw has dropped

Until the music stop, you know

I still run this thing like a dancehall queen

I really don't want no hassle

Now what, your jaw has dropped

Until the music stop, you know

I still run this thing like a dancehall queen

I really don't want no hassle

// None Of Dem //

None of these boys can dance

Not a single one of them stand a chance

All of them girls a mess

I've seen it all before I'm not impressed

None of them get my sex 

None of them move my intellect 

None of them work for me 

None of them make me feel anything


I'm so bored in this town

Take me away from here

Play me some kind of new sound

Something true and sincere

I've got a little girl singing on repeat in my head (oh-ho)

Take me far away from here


None of them get my stands

None of them do it like I can

None of these chicks got style

None of these drugs get me high

None of these beats are raw

None of these beats ever break the law

None of them kicks go boom

None of them bass lines fill the room


I'm so bored in this town

Take me away from here

Play me some kind of new sound

Something true and sincere

I've got a little girl singing on repeat in my head (oh-ho)

Take me far away from here


I'm so bored in this town

Take me away from here

Play me some kind of new sound

Something true and sincere

I've got a little girl singing on repeat in my head (oh-ho)

Take me far away from here

// In My Eyes //

Konichiwa Records

It's gonna be OK


OK

OK


Hey little star, don't be afraid

We all fall apart and make mistakes

Don't you know nothing ever seem to make sense

You put your dancing shoes on and do it again

You know I believe it if you say you can


So when you feel like it's all pretend

Then you look into my eyes

Just say one true thing like you mean it

And, baby, just look into my eyes


The sun's gonna shine on all of us

We're all the same - stardust and stuff

You're just a little boy and I'm just a little girl

Programmed rebels in a cruel, cruel world

We never get what we deserve


So when you feel like it's all pretend

Then you look into my eyes

Just say one true thing like you mean it

And, baby, just look into my eyes


And though I bet you think it's better on the inside, there with them

We're better off outside looking back in

I know you think you're lost but you think again

When you look into my eyes


OK


Hey little star, come take my hand

You'll feel better tomorrow

Tomorrow I'm still your friend


So when you feel like it's all pretend

Then you look into my eyes

Just say one true thing like you mean it

And, baby, just look into my eyes


I bet you think it's better on the inside, there with them

We're better off outside looking back in

I know you think you're lost but you think again

When you look into my eyes


OK


Little star

I got you

I got you

You'll be OK

You'll be OK

// Hang With Me //

Will you tell me once again

How we're gonna be just friends?

If you're for real and not pretend

Then I guess you can hang with me


When my patience wearing thin

When I'm ready to give in

Will you pick me up again

Then I guess you can hang with me


And if you do me right

I'm gonna do right by you

And if you keep it tight

I'm gonna confide in you

I know what's on your mind

There will be time for that too

If you hang with me


Just don't fall

Recklessly, headlessly in love with me

Cause it's gonna be

All heartbreak

Blissfully painful and insanity

If we agree

Oh, you can hang with me


When you see me drift astray

Outta touch and outta place

Will you tell me to my face?

Then I guess you can hang with me


And if you do me right

I'm gonna do right by you

And if you keep it tight

I'm gonna confide in you

I know what's on your mind

There will be time for that too

If you hang with me


Just don't fall

Recklessly, headlessly in love with me

Cause it's gonna be

All heartbreak

Blissfully painful and insanity

If we agree

Oh, you can hang with me


Will you tell me once again

How we're gonna be just friends?

If you're for real and not pretend

Then I guess you can hang with me


And if you do me right

I'm gonna do right by you

And if you keep it tight

I'm gonna confide in you

I know what's on your mind

There will be time for that too

If you hang with me


Just don't fall

Recklessly, headlessly in love with me

Cause it's gonna be

All heartbreak

Blissfully painful and insanity

If we agree

You can hang with me


Don't fall

Recklessly, headlessly in love with me

Cause it's gonna be

All heartbreak

Blissfully painful and insanity

If we agree

Oh, you can hang with me

// U Should Know Better //

I've gone around the world and the seven seas

I'm cashin' six-figure checks in all currencies

It's like when I be tearin' it up in Paris

Motherfuckers parler on the m-i-c

It's all "ooh la la" and "ahh oui oui"

Sippin' vin blanc in our lingerie

Choppin' heads off with madame guillotine

Even the French know better than to fuck with me


Comment allez-vous Robyn, what it do

I'm in the UK (why?) got a show to do (uh-huh)

It's big Snoopy Dogg, check the catalog

I'm overseas gettin' cheese with this dialogue

I missed my plane to Spain so I'm stuck in Colonna

I'm sippin' Saronno with this chick named Ramona

She wants me to take a flick on her phone-ah

Then take her to my hotel room and then bone her


You know when in Rome I sat down with the Romans

Said "We need a black pope and she better be a woman"

There'll be no more celibacy

Even the Vatican knows not to fuck with me


You should know better

Y-You should know better

You should know better than to fuck with me

If you knew better you would do better

You should know better

Y-You should know better

You should know better than to fuck with me

If you knew better you would do better


We big-ballin' in Holland, Amsterdam my man

I got a table at the coffee shop

Where we like to spark a lot

Hangin' in the parking lot blowin' a bleezy

Easy fo sheezy deezy


I crashed a party with the Czar

Threw a molotov cocktail in the bar

And you know my style's revolutionary

Even the Russians know better than to fuck with me


You try to ban me, you can't stand me

Cuz I'm an outlaw

Black president livin' in the White House

Mr. B he wrote a letter to me

The FBI know better than to fuck with me


Yo, I was there at Watergate

You know I rigged my gear got the fuckers on tape

They put the mic in the hand of the wrong MC

Even the CIA knows not to fuck with me


You should know better

Y-You should know better

You should know better than to fuck with me

If you knew better you would do better

You should know better

Y-You should know better

You should know better than to fuck with me

If you knew better you would do better


Tell 'em Snoop, tell 'em like it is


I been there, in there, out there like that

Right back to the hood, a hundred Euro stacks

Shoot motherfuckers just on GP

LAPD know better than to fuck with me


I danced with the devil in Kathmandu

I came hummin' and blastin' with the boogaloo too

Now I declare most solemnly

The prince of darkness know better than to fuck with me


You know not what you know

Tell 'em what I'm in it for

Then I run up in it slow

Really though, silly ho

Yea spend a minute though

I blow an ounce and make you bounce

Just like a sixty-four


Now you know me I'm a woman of peace

I don't never take nothin' don't belong to me

I throw down and say "Whatever's gonna be, gonna be"

The whole industry knows not to fuck with me


You should know better

Y-You should know better

You should know better than to fuck with me

If you knew better you would do better

You should know better

Y-You should know better

You should know better than to fuck with me

If you knew better you would do better

You should know better

Y-You should know better

You should know better than to fuck with me

If you knew better you would do better

// Indestructible //

I'm going backwards through time at the speed of light
I'm yours, you're mine
Two satellites
Not alone
No, we're not alone

A freeze-frame of your eye in the strobe light
Sweat dripping down from your brow
Hold tight
Don't let go
Don't you let me go

And I never was smart with love
I let the bad ones in and the good ones go

But I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible
Your love is ultramagnetic
And it's taking over
This is hardcore
And I'm indestructible

Hands up in the air like we don't care
We're shooting deep into space
And the lasers split the dark
Cut right through the dark

It's just us. We ignore the crowd dancing
Fall to the floor
Beats in my heart
Put your hands on my heart

And I never was smart with love
I let the bad ones in and the good ones go

But I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible
Your love is ultramagnetic
And it's taking over
This is hardcore

Ooh and I'm gonna love you like

I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible
Your love is ultramagnetic
And it's taking over
This is hardcore
And I'm indestructible

And I never was smart with love
I let the bad ones in and the good ones go

But I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible
Your love is ultramagnetic
And it's taking over
This is hardcore

Ooh and I'm gonna love you like

I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before
I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible
Your love is ultramagnetic
And it's taking over
This is hardcore
And I'm indestructible

// Time Machine //

Hey, what did I do?

Can't believe the fit I just threw

Stupid

Wanted the reaction


I remember the words

How I said them, so they would hurt

But then, I regret my actions


If I could press rewind

Rewind the take

Redefine the line

We make mistakes

Take it back in time, 

Just one day ... hey


So all I need is a time machine

A one way track cause

I'm taking it back, taking it back

All I want is a DeLorean

If I could go just like that

I'll be taking it back, taking it back


Yeah who's laughing now?

Didn't think you'd actually go

Stupid

Me and all my bitching


Second thoughts and regrets

?? but then

This ain't science fiction


If I could press rewind

Rewind the take

Redefine the line

We make mistakes

Take it back in time, 

Just one day ... hey


So all I need is a time machine

A one way track cause

I'm taking it back, taking it back

All I want is a DeLorean

If I could go just like that

I'll be taking it back, taking it back


So all I need is a time machine

A one way track cause

I'm taking it back, taking it back

// Call Your Girlfriend //

Call your girlfriend
It's time you had the talk
Give your reasons
Say it's not her fault
But you just met somebody new

Tell her not to get upset, second-guessing everything you said and done
And then when she gets upset tell her how you never meant to hurt no one

Then you tell her that the only way her heart will mend is when she learns to love again
And it won't make sense right now but you're still her friend
And then you let her down easy

Call your girlfriend
It's time you had the talk
Give your reasons
Say it's not her fault
But you just met somebody new

Don't you tell her how I give you something that you never even knew you missed
Don't you even try and explain how it's so different when we kiss

You just tell her that the only way her heart will mend is when she learns to love again
And it won't make sense right now but you're still her friend
And then you let her down easy

Call your girlfriend
It's time you had the talk
Give your reasons
Say it's not her fault
But you just met somebody new

And now it's gonna be me and you

And you tell her that the only way her heart will mend is when she learns to love again
And it won't make sense right now but you're still her friend
And then you let her down easy

Call your girlfriend (call your girlfriend)
It's time you had the talk
Give your reasons
Say it's not her fault

// Get Myself Together //

It's all over like steps in the first snow

Something's been building up and it's gonna blow

My momma called me last night, she said what nothing else fits

Pick up the pieces and move on

I see the flashing lights, just can't make sense of the bits 

It's like my mind is gone


I got ... got to get ...

Get my head back on

I got ... got to get ...

Myself together

When this hurt is gone

I got ... got to get ...

Myself together


I got ... got to get ...

Can't tell what's going wrong

I wish there's something could be done

Knock that cover

When this hurt is gone

I got ... got to get ...

Myself together


Can't stand to see you upset

But you already know

The more close it gets

The less I wanna go


I saw my brother last night

He said I know you too well

You can't pretend that's nothing wrong

I see the fuse that ignites, like I'm outside of myself

It's like my mind is gone


I got ... got to get ...

Get my head back on

I got ... got to get ...

Myself together

When this hurt is gone

I got ... got to get ...

Myself together


I got ... got to get ...

Can't tell what's going wrong

I wish there's something could be done

Knock that cover

When this hurt is gone

I got ... got to get ...

Myself together


My daddy put me aside

Like when I was a child

He said I trust you decide

On what you know is right

And for whatever it's worth, 

I am on your side

There's no denying the mess

That I got us in

And I've been trying my best

Not to make a scene

Just can't make a sense of it all

It's like my mind is gone


I got ... got to get ...

Get my head back on

I got ... got to get ...

Myself together

When this hurt is gone

I got ... got to get ...

Myself together


I got ... got to get ...

Can't tell what's going wrong

I wish there's something could be done

Knock that cover

When this hurt is gone

I got ... got to get ...

Myself together


I got ... got to get ...

Can't tell what's going wrong

I wish there's something could be done

Knock that cover

When this hurt is gone

I got ... got to get ...
