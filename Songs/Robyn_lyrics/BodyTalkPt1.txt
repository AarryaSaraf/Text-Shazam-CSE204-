// Cry When You Get Older //

Hey girl in the strobing light
What your mama never told you
Is love hurts when you do it right
You can cry when you get older
Young boy by the traffic light
What your daddy never told you
Is love hurts when you do it right
You can cry when you get older

Hold up a second, now I got something on my dirty mind
I start out with good intentions but mess it up like all the time
I try to keep up appearance but always end up way out of line
I need some kind of miracle, cause I lost all my faith in science
So I put my faith in me

She said: "There just must be more to life than this"
He said: "Careful, cause you might just get your wish"

Hey girl in the strobing light
What your mama never told you
Is love hurts when you do it right
You can cry when you get older
Young boy by the traffic light
What your daddy never told you
Is love hurts when you do it right
You can cry when you get older

Back in suburbia kids get high and make out on the train
Then endless incomprehensible boredom takes a hold again
And in this other dream I'm on top of the world, ahead of the game
Think of reality and it hits me hardcore to the brain
We've got to get away

She said: "There just must be more to life than this"
He said: "Careful, cause you might just get your wish"

Hey girl in the strobing light
What your mama never told you
Is love hurts when you do it right
You can cry when you get older
Young boy by the traffic light
What your daddy never told you
Is love hurts when you do it right
You can cry when you get older

Bet your mama never told you that

// Hang With Me (Acoustic Version) //

Will you tell me once again
How we're gonna be just friends?
If you're for real and not pretend
Then I guess you can hang with me

When my patience's wearing thin
When I'm ready to give in
Will you pick me up again?
Then I guess you can hang with me

And if you do me right
I'm gonna do right by you
And if you keep it tight
I'm gonna confide in you
I know what's on your mind
There will be time for that too
If you hang with me
Hang with me

Just don't fall
Recklessly, headlessly in love with me
Cause it's gonna be
All heartbreak
Blissfully painful and insanity
If we agree

Oh, you can hang with me

When you see me drift astray
Outta touch and outta place
Will you tell me to my face?
Then I guess you can hang with me

And if you do me right
I'm gonna do right by you
And if you keep it tight
I'm gonna confide in you
I know what's on your mind
There will be time for that too
If you hang with me

Just don't fall
Recklessly, headlessly in love with me
Cause it's gonna be
All heartbreak
Blissfully painful and insanity
If we agree you can hang with me

Just don't fall
Recklessly, headlessly in love with me
Cause it's gonna be
All heartbreak
Blissfully painful and insanity
If we agree

Oh, you can hang with me
Hang with me

// Jag Vet En Dejlig Rosa //

Jag vet en dejlig rosa och vit som liljeblad
NÃ¤r jag pÃ¥ henne tÃ¤nker sÃ¥ gÃ¶rs mitt hjÃ¤rta glad
Dess stÃ¤mma ger en hjÃ¤rtans trÃ¶st
Lik nÃ¤ktergalens blida rÃ¶st
SÃ¥ fager och sÃ¥ ljuv

Som solen fagert skiner Ã¤r hon som purpur klar
Gud lÃ¥t dig aldrig sÃ¶rja men alltid vara glad
MÃ¥ de fÃ¥ komma samman
Med hjÃ¤rtans frÃ¶jd och gamman
Som lÃ¤ngta till varann

Var dag gÃ¥r solen neder och dagelig uppgÃ¥r
NÃ¤r kommer dagen blider att jag dig skÃ¥da fÃ¥r
I hÃ¥gen Ã¤r du jÃ¤mt mig nÃ¤r
FarvÃ¤l, farvÃ¤l min hjÃ¤rtans kÃ¤r
MÃ¥ngtusende godnatt
