// Chances Are //

Chances are we're gonna leave now
Sorry for the victim now

Though my days are filled with sorrow
I see here a bright tomorrow
Chances, chances are some might not hold out
Chances are hang on right now

Though all of my, days are filled with sorrow
I stay here a bright tomorrow

Chances, chances are some might not hold out
Chances are hang on right now
Chances are oh, chances, you're my chances
Chances are hang on right now
(Chances are) hang on right now

Deal with loneliness heartaches and teardrops
(Chances are) we'll have to wait
(Chances are) hang on right now
Chances are chances are
Oh chances, you're my chances

// Soul Rebel //

I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer

See the morning sun
On the hillside
Not living good, yeah! Travel wide
Said, I'm a living man
I've got work to do
If you're not happy, children
Then you must be blue
(Must be blue, must be blue) people say

I'm a rebel, let them talk
Soul rebel, talk won't bother me
I'm a capturer, that's what they say
Soul adventurer, night and day

I'm a rebel, soul rebel
Do you hear them lippy?
I'm a capturer, gossip around the corner
Soul adventurer. How they adventure on me

But see a morning sun
On the hillside
Not living good, travel wide
Said, I'm a living man
I've got work to do
If you're not happy, you must be blue

I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer
Do you hear me?
I'm a rebel, rebel in the morning
Soul rebel, rebel at midday time

// Stay With Me //

Down on my knees
Beggin' you please
Stay with me
Stay with me
Have I done you so wrong girl
Won't you stay with me
I pray each night
With tears in eyes
I pray this time I can keep something good
And if my prayers are answered
We'll be happy like we should
You can stop your tears from fallin'
Can't you hear my heart a callin' you stay
Why should lovers' quarrel and a bicker
Why let foolish pride stand in our way, ooh

// I'm Hurting Inside //

Oh-a-w-oh
When I was just a little child
(Little child)
Happiness was there awhile
(There awhile)
And from me, it
It slipped one day (ay)
Happiness
Come back I say

'Cause if you don't come
I've got to go looking
For happiness

Well if you don't come
I've got to go looking
God, for happiness... happiness

Say that
Say I'm hurting
(Inside) and it's no
I'm hurting
I'm hurting
Deep inside

Oh good God now

Oh hear my cry
Hear my cry
Yeah my my my my my my my cry

Been together like school children
(School children)
Then you hurt me just in vain
(Just in vain)
Oh
Lord, I'm your little child
(Little child)
Oh
Happiness come back awhile

'Cause if you don't come
I'm going a looking
For happiness
The road is dangerous

'Cause if you don't come
I've got to go looking
For happiness...happiness

Said I'm
Don't you know I'm
I'm hurting, hurting inside

Oh I'm hurting

Who cares
Who cares

Does the one who love
Oh
Feel the pain
Feel the pain

Does the one who love
Feel the pain
Feel the pain

(Been together)
Been together like school children
