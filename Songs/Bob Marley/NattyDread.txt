// No Woman No Cry //

No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry

'Cause, 'cause, 'cause I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown
Oba, observing the hypocrites, yeah
Mingle with the good people we meet, yeah
Good friends we have had, oh good friends we've lost along the way, yeah
In this bright future you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say, yeah

No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry, eh, yeah
Little darling don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

Eh, said, said, said I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Trenchtown, yeah
And then Georgie would make the fire light, I say
A log wood burning through the night
Then we would cook corn meal porridge, I say
Of which I'll share with you, yeah
My feet is my only carriage
And so I've got to push on through
But while I'm gone

Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
So no woman, no cry
No woman, no cry, I say
Oh little, oh little darling, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry, eh

No woman, no woman, no woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
One more time I've got to say
Oh little, little darling, please don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

Them belly full, but we hungry
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain a-fall, but the dirt it tough
A yut a yook but yood no' 'nough

Cost of living gets so high
Rich and poor they start to cry
Now the weak must get strong
They say, "Oh, what a tribulation!"

Them belly full, but we hungry
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain a-fall, but the dirt it tough
A pot a cook but the food no' 'nough
You're gonna dance to Jah music, dance
We're gonna dance to Jah music, dance, oh-ooh

A belly full, but them hungry
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain a-fall, but the dirt it tough
A pot a-cook, but the food no' 'nough
A hungry man is a angry man
A rain a-fall, but the dirt it tough
A pot a-cook, but the food no' 'nough
A rain a-fall, but the dirt it tough
A pot a-cook, but the food no' 'nough
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A hungry mob is a angry mob
