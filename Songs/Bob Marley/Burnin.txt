// Get Up, Stand Up //

Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight

Preacher man don't tell me heaven is under the earth
I know you don't know what life is really worth
It's not all that glitter is gold and
Half the story has never been told
So now you see the light, ay
Stand up for your right. Come on

Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight

Most people think great God will come from the sky
Take away everything, and make everybody feel high
But if you know what life is worth
You would look for yours on earth
And now you see the light
You stand up for your right, yeah

Get up, stand up (Yeah, yeah)
Stand up for your right (Oh-huh)
Get up, stand up (Get up, stand up)
Don't give up the fight (Life is your right)
Get up, stand up(So we can't give up the fight)
Stand up for your right (Lord, Lord)
Get up, stand up (Keep on struggling on)
Don't give up the fight (Yeah)

We're sick and tired of your ism and schism game
Die and go to heaven in Jesus' name, Lord
We know and we understand
Almighty God is a living man
You can fool some people sometimes
But you can't fool all the people all the time
So now we see the light
(What you gonna do?)
We going to stand up for our right
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

So you'd better

Get up, stand up (Don't give it up)
Stand up for your right (Stand up right now)
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight
(Don't give it up, don't give it up)
Get up, stand up (Get up, stand up)
Stand up for your right (Get up, stand up)
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right
Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight
Get up, stand up, stand up for your right

// Hallelujah Time //

Hear the children crying
But I know they cry not in vain
Now the times are changing
Love has come to bloom again
Smelling the air when spring comes by raindrops
Reminds us of youthful days
But now it's not rain that water the cane crops
But the sweat from man's brow
The substance from our spine
We got to keep on living, living on borrowed time

Hallelujah time
Yes, you can hear the children singing
Hallelujah time
As they go singing by and by
Hallelujah time
Oh, "hallelujah" singing in the morning
Hallelujah time
Let them sing, don't let them cry

Over rocks and mountains
The sheep are scattered all around
Over hills and valleys
They are everywhere to be found
But though we bear our burdens now
All afflictions got to end somehow
From swinging the hammer, pulling the plough
Why won't you let us be, to live in harmony
We like to be free like birds in a tree

Hallelujah time
Yes, you can hear the children singing
Hallelujah time
As they go singing by and by
Hallelujah time
Oh, "hallelujah" singing in the morning
Hallelujah time
Let them sing, don't let them cry

// I Shot The Sheriff //

I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot no deputy, oh no, oh
I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot no deputy, ooh, ooh, ooh

Yeah, all around in my home town
They're trying to track me down, yeah
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy
For the life of a deputy
But I say
Oh, now, now, oh

I shot the sheriff, the sheriff
But I swear it was in self-defense, oh no
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
I say, I shot the sheriff, oh Lord
And they say it is a capital offense, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what, I don't know
Every time I plant a seed
He said kill it before it grow
He said kill them before they grow
And so, and so
Read it in the news

I shot the sheriff, oh Lord
But I swear it was in self-defense
Where was the deputy? Ooh, ooh, ooh
I say, I shot the sheriff
But I swear it was in self-defense, yeah
Ooh-ooh

Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town, yeah
All of a sudden I saw Sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down
So I shot, I shot, I shot him down and I say
If I am guilty I will pay (pay, pay, pay, pay, pay)

I shot the sheriff
But I say, but I didn't shoot no deputy
I didn't shoot no deputy, oh no, ooh, ooh, ooh
I shot the sheriff, I did
But I didn't shoot no deputy, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Reflexes had the better of me
And what is to be must be
Every day the bucket a-go a well
One day the bottom a-go drop out
One day the bottom a-go drop out

I say
I-I-I, I shot the sheriff
Lord, I didn't shot the deputy, no
Yeah, I-I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot no deputy, yeah, so, yeah

// Burnin' And Lootin' //

This morning I woke up in a curfew
O God, I was a prisoner, too - yeah!
Could not recognize the faces standing over me
They were all dressed in uniforms of brutality. (Ay!)

How many rivers do we have to cross
Before we can talk to the boss? (Yeah!)
All that we got, it seems we have lost
We must have really paid the cost

(That's why we gonna be)
Burning and a-looting tonight
(Say we gonna burn and loot)
Burning and a-looting tonight
(One more thing)
Burning all pollution tonight
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
Burning all illusion tonight

Oh, stop them!

Give me the food and let me grow
Let the Roots Man take a blow
All them drugs gonna make you slow now
It's not the music of the ghetto. (Ay!)

Weeping and a-wailing tonight
(Who can stop the tears?)
Weeping and a-wailing tonight
(We've been suffering these long, long-a years!)
Weeping and a-wailing tonight
(Will you say cheer?)
Weeping and a-wailing tonight
(But where?)

Give me the food and let me grow
Let the Roots Man take a blow
All them drugs gonna make you slow now
It's not the music of the ghetto. (Ay!)

We gonna be burning and a-looting tonight
(To survive, yeah!)
Burning and a-looting tonight
(Save your baby lives)
Burning all pollution tonight
(Pollution, yeah, yeah!)
Burning all illusion tonight

Burning and a-looting tonight
Burning and a-looting tonight

// Small Axe //

Why boasteth thyself
Oh, he-vil man
Playing smart
And not being clever, oh, no
I said you're working iniquity
To achieve vanity, yeah, if a-so a-so
But the goodness of Jah-Jah
I-dureth for-i-ver

If you are the big tree
We are the small axe
Sharpened to cut you down (Well sharp)
Ready to cut you down, oh, yeah

These are the words
Of my master, keep on telling me, oh
No weak heart shall prosper, oh, no, they can't, eh, eh

Whosoever diggeth a pit, Lord
Shall fall in it, shall fall in it
Whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall bury in it, shall bury in it

If you are the big tree
We are the small axe
Sharpened to cut you down
Ready to cut you down

Eh, whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it, fall in it, eh
Whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall bury in it, shall bury in it

If you have a big tree
We have a small axe
Ready to cut you down (Well sharp)
Sharpened to cut you down, oh

If you are the big tree, let me tell you this
We are the small axe
Ready to cut you down (Well sharp)
Sharpened to cut you down
If you are the big tree
We are the small axe

// Pass It On //

What your hands do
It's your own eyes that've seen
So won't you judge your actions
To make sure the results are clean?

It's your own conscience
That is gonna remind you
That it's your heart and nobody else's
That is gonna judge

Be not selfish in your doings:
Pass it on. (Pass it on, children)
Help your brothers (help them) in their needs:
Pass it on

Live for yourself and you will live in vain
Live for others, you will live again

In the kingdom of Jah
Man shall reign
Pass it on
Pass it on
Pass it on
Pass it on

What's in the darkness
Must be revealed to light
We're not here to judge what's good from bad
But to do the things that are right

On a hot, sunny day
Follow the shadows for rescue
But as the day grows old
I know the sun is gonna find you

Be not selfish in your doings:
Pass it on
Help your brothers in their needs:
Pass it on

Live for yourself, you will live in vain
Live for others, you will live again

In the kingdom of Jah
Man shall reign
Pass it on
Pass it on
Pass it on
Pass it on. (Pass it on)

// Duppy Conqueror //

Yes, me friend
We de a street again
Yes, me friend, me good friend
Them say we free again

The bars could not hold me
Force could not control me, now
They try to keep me down
But Jah put I around
Yes, I've been accused, many a times
And wrongly abused now
But through the powers of the Most High
They've got to turn me loose

Don't try to cold me up on this bridge, now
I've got to reach Mount Zion
The highest region
If you a bull-bucker
Let me tell you this
I'm a duppy conqueror, conqueror

We de a street again
Yes, me friend, me good friend
Them say we free again

Don't try to cold me up on this bridge, now

So if you a bull-bucker
Let me tell you this
I'm a duppy conqueror, conqueror

Yes, me friend
Them say we're free again
Yes, me friend, me good friend
Them set de a street again

// Rasta Man Chant //

Hear the words of the rasta man, say
Babylon your throne gone down, gone down
Babylon your throne gone down

Said, I hear the words of the higher man say
Babylon your throne gone down, gone down
Babylon your throne gone down

And I hear the angel with the seven seals, saying, saying, yeah, yeah, yeah
Babylon your throne gone down, gone down
Babylon your throne gone down

I say fly away home to Zion, fly away home
I say fly away home to Zion, fly away home
One bright morning when man work is over
Man will fly away home

One bright morning when man work is over
Man will fly away home
One bright morning when man work is over
Man will fly away home

I say fly away home to Zion, fly away home

Fly away home, fly away home
Fly away home, fly away home

// Reincarnated Souls //

(We are reincarnated souls from that time)
And we are living on earth
Heat air and water (This time)

(We are reincarnated souls from that time)
And we are living on earth
Heat air and water (This time)

In the beginning was the word
And the word manifested itself in the flesh
Which even became man, all because of the divine plan
Man being lowered and the angel
Over all the earth was he given dominion
He devised his own destruction
(But the word lives on and on)

(He who is weary)Let him come hither
(He who has eyes to see)Let him look yonder
(All who are thirsty)Let them drink clear water
(Drink water, drink water)

(We are reincarnated souls from that time)
And we are living on earth
Heat air and water (This time)

(We are reincarnated souls from that time)
And we are living on earth
Heat air and water (This time)

Nothing is new under the sun;
All has been here since time begun
With all the years we spent
(Only changing names protect the innocent)
Like seed that is planted by the water
A prayer to die before new birth
Changing its form to another
Taking on a structure just as the first

(He who is weary)Let him come hither
(He who has eyes to see)Let him look yonder
(All who are thirsty)Let them drink clear water
(Drink water, drink water)

// No Sympathy //

I can't find no love
No sympathy
What kind of love
They've got for me
I'm on my way
To happiness
Where I can find
Some peace and rest

When I'm in my trouble here
Only me feels the pain
Not one good word of advice
From any of my so called friends

I can't find no love
No sympathy
What kind of love
They've got for me
I'm on my way
To happiness
Where I can find
Some peace and rest

Might as well, might as well
I get out, I get out of hell
Hell would never be made for me
So I'm gonna search, search 'til I'm free

I can't find no love
No sympathy
What kind of love
They've got for me
I'm on my way
To happiness
Where I can find

// The Oppressed Song //

The man oppressed will seem to do the worst
But with all he possesses self preservation comes first
His damnation comes not from burning free
As destruction of the poor is their poverty, is their poverty

While oppression is the poor man's choice
Ah, but in this he does rejoice
His burdens, though heavy, he somehow bears
As for his seed, there's only one who cares
There's only one who cares

Though his pilgrimage extends, his progresses ascend
But as the prudent one exalts, he is gonna find his faults
But as the wise man sees, he knows, he knows
There's no rest in the west, so to the east he goes
To the east he goes (To the east he goes)
Where he can find peace of mind, oh
