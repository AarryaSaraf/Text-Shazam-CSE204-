// Who The Cap Fit //

Man to man is so unjust, children
You don't know who to trust
Your worst enemy could be your best friend
And your best friend your worst enemy

Some will eat and drink with you
Then behind them su-su 'pon you
Only your friend know your secrets
So only he could reveal it

And who the cap fit, let them wear it
Who the cap fit, let them wear it
Said I throw me corn, me no call no fowl
I saying, "Cook-cook-cook, cluk-cluk-cluk"

Some will hate you, pretend they love you now
Then behind they try to eliminate you
But who Jah bless, no one curse
Thank God, we're past the worst

Hypocrites and parasites
Will come up and take a bite
And if your night should turn to day
A lot of people would run away

And who the stock fit let them wear it
Who the cap fit let them wear it
And then I gonna throw me corn
And then I gonna call no fowl
And then I gonna "Cook-cook-cook"
Mmm, yeah, "cluk-cluk-cluk"

Some will eat and drink with you
Then behind them su-su 'pon you
And if night should turn to day, now
A lot of people would run away

And who the cap fit, let them wear it
Who the cap fit, let them wear it
Throw me corn, me no call no fowl
I banging "Cook-cook-cook, cluk-cluk-cluk"

Throw me corn (cook-cook-cook)
Me call no fowl (cluk-cluk-cluk)

// War //

Until the philosophy which hold one race
Superior and another inferior
Is finally
And permanently
Discredited
And abandoned
Everywhere is war
Me say war

That until there are no longer
First-class and second-class citizens of any nation
Until the colour of a man's skin
Is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes
Me say war

That until the basic human rights
Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race
Dis a war

That until that day
The dream of lasting peace
World citizenship
Rule of international morality
Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued
But never attained
Now everywhere is war
War

And until the ignoble and unhappy regime
That hold our brothers in Angola
In Mozambique
South Africa
Sub-human bondage
Have been toppled
Utterly destroyed
Well, everywhere is war
Me say war

War in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south

War, war
Rumors of war
And until that day
The African continent
Will not know peace
We Africans will fight, we find it necessary
And we know we shall win
As we are confident
In the victory
Of good over evil

Good over evil, yeah!
Good over evil
Good over evil, yeah!
Good over evil
Good over evil, yeah!

// Natural Mystic //

There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
If you listen carefully now you will hear

This could be the first trumpet, might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die
Don't ask me why
Things are not the way they used to be
I won't tell no lie

One and all got to face reality now
Though I've tried to find the answer to all the questions they ask
Though I know it's impossible to go living through the past
Don't tell no lie

There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
Can't keep them down
If you listen carefully now you will hear

Such a natural mystic, blowing through the air

This could be the first trumpet, might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die - don't ask me why

There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
I won't tell no lie
If you listen carefully now you will hear
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air

Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air

// Sun Is Shining //

Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
Make you want to move your dancing feet
To the rescue, here I am
Want you to know, you all, where I stand

(Monday morning) here I am
Want you to know just if you can
(Tuesday evening) where I stand
(Wednesday morning) Tell myself a new day is rising
(Thursday evening) get on the rise
A new day is dawning
(Friday morning) here I am
(Saturday evening) want you to know just
Want you to know just where I stand

When the morning gathers the rainbow
Want you to know I'm a rainbow too
So to the rescue, here I am
Want you to know just if you can
Where I stand, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know

We'll lift our heads and give Jah praises

Sun is shining, the weather is sweet
Make you want to move your dancing feet
To the rescue, here I am
Want you to know, you all, where I stand

(Monday morning) here I am
Want you to know just if you can
(Tuesday evening) where I stand
(Wednesday morning) Tell myself a new day is rising
(Thursday evening) get on the rise
A new day is dawning
(Friday morning) here I am
(Saturday evening) want you to know just
Want you to know just where I stand

To the rescue, to the rescue
To the rescue, to the rescue
Awake from your sleep and slumber
Today could bring your lucky number

Sun is shining and the weather is sweet
Sun is shining

// Time Will Tell //

Jah would never give the power to a bald head
Run come crucify the Dread

Time alone - oh, time will tell
Think you are in heaven, but you living in hell
Think you are in heaven, but you living in hell
Think you are in heaven, but you living in hell
Time alone - oh, time will tell
You think you are in heaven, but you living in hell

Back them up, not the brothers
But the ones who sets them up

Time alone - oh, time will tell
Think you are in heaven, but you living in hell
Think you are in heaven, but you living in hell
Think you are in heaven, but you living in hell
Time alone - oh, time will tell
You think you are in heaven, but you living in hell

Mm, sold my freedom 'round the world
Sold man to the ground
Sold man, took a man pride
Oh, children, weep no more
Oh, my sycamore tree, saw the freedom tree
Saw you settle the score
Oh, children, weep no more

Jah would never give the power to a bald head
Run come crucify the Dread

Time alone - oh, time will tell
Think you are in heaven, but you living in hell
Think you are in heaven, but you living in hell
Think you are in heaven, but you living in hell
Time alone - oh, time will tell
You think you are in heaven, but you living in hell

// So Much Trouble In The World //

So much trouble in the world
So much trouble in the world

Bless my eyes this morning
Jah sun is on the rise once again
The way earthly thing's are going
Anything can happen

You see men sailing on their ego trip
Blast off on their spaceship
Million miles from reality:
No care for you, no care for me

So much trouble in the world
So much trouble in the world
All you got to do: give a little (give a little)
Give a little (give a little), give a little (give a little)!
One more time, ye-ah! (give a little) Ye-ah! (give a little)
Ye-ah! (give a little) Yeah!

So you think you've found the solution
But it's just another illusion!
(So before you check out this tide)
Don't leave another cornerstone
Standing there behind, eh-eh-eh-eh!
We've got to face the day
(Ooh) Ooh-wee, come what may:
We the street people talkin'
Yeah, we the people strugglin'

Now they sitting on a time bomb; (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)
Now I know the time has come: (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)
What goes on up is coming on down, (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)
Goes around and comes around. (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)

So much trouble in the world
So much trouble in the world
So much trouble in the world
There is so much trouble (so much trouble in the world)
There is so much trouble
There is so much trouble (so much in the world)
There is so much trouble
There is so much trouble in the world (so much trouble in the world)
There is (so much in the world)
(So much trouble in the world)

// Pimper's Paradise //

She love to party, have a good time
She looks so hearty, feeling fine
She loves to smoke, sometime shiftin' coke
She'll be laughin' when there ain't no joke

A pimper's paradise: that's all she was now
A pimper's paradise: that's all she was
A pimper's paradise: that's all she was now
Pimper's paradise: that's all she was
(Every need got an ego to feed
Every need got an ego to feed.)

She loves to model up in the latest fashion (oo-bee doo-be doo)
She's in the scramble and she moves with passion (oo-bee doo-be doo)
She's getting high, trying to fly the sky (oo-bee doo-be doo)!
Eh! Now she is bluesing when there ain't no blues

Wo-o-o-oh! A pimper's paradise: that's all she was now
A pimper's paradise: that's all she was, oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!
A pimper's paradise: that's all she was now
A pimper's paradise: that's all she was

(Every need got an ego to feed
Every need got an ego to feed.)

Wo-ho-o-oh! A pimper's paradise: that's all she was now, wo-oo-o-oo! Wo-oh!
