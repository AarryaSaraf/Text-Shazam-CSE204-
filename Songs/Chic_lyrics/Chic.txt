// Dance, Dance, Dance (Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah) //

Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on dancing
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Just dancing to the beat
Feel the heat
I'm moving my feet

Heading towards the floor
Gotta get down
Get down some more

Rumba and tango
Latin hustle too
(Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah)
I wanna boogie with you

Papapapapa
Papapapapa
Papapapapa
Papapapapa

Ooh, what a treat
Feels so sweet (Ah)
That body heat

When I'm dancing with my baby
Drives me crazy
Makes me hazy

Rumba and tango
Latin hustle too
(Yowsah, yowsah, yowsah)
I wanna boogie with you

Papapapapa
Papapapapa
Papapapapa
Papapapapa

Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on, keep on
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on dancing

Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on, keep on
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on dancing

// You Can Get By //

You can get by if you try
You can get by if you try

Somewhere in the city
There's someone for you
Maybe in some doorway
You know love begins there too

I know it's a pity
To be so all alone
The bed seems so empty
And not a ring from the phone

You can get by if you try
You can get by if you try
You may not be pretty

Oh but you can be, you know
Take off those shabby clothes, girl
And let your beauty show
Make yourself a lovely woman
And get yourself a man
Then you will be happy
You can do it, yes you can, hey hey

You can get by if you try
You can get by if you try
You can get by if you try
You can get by if you try

[Repeat and fade]

// Everybody Dance //

Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap you hands

Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands

Music never lets you down
Puts a smile on your face any time, anyplace
Dancing helps relieve the pain
Soothes your mind, makes you happy again

Listen to those dancing feet close your eyes and let go
But it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
Bop-shoo-wa, bop-shoo-wa, bop-shoo-wa

Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap you hands

Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands

Spinning all around the floor just like Rogers and Astaire
Who found love without a care stepping to our favorite tune
The good times always end too soon

Everybody's dancing lift your feet, have some fun
Come on everybody, get on your feet
Clap your hands everybody's screaming

Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap you hands

Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands

Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap you hands

Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands

Everybody dance
Everybody dance
Everybody dance
Everybody dance

Everybody dance
Everybody dance
Everybody dance
Everybody dance

Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap you hands

Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands

Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap you hands

Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Everybody dance, do-do-do
Clap your hands, clap your hands

// Est-Ce Que (C'est Chic) //

Est-ce que c'est chic
Ou simplement ordinaire

Est-ce que c'est chic chic

ÃŠtre
Est-ce que c'est chic
Ou simplement ordinaire

Est-ce que c'est chic chic

Won't get far
Hangin' at the local bar

Will she ever be a star
And ride around in a fancy car

And buy expensive things
Like furs and diamond rings

All alone she lives her life
In the midst of us

She can't believe her eyes
All the rest of her

And it's the little things
She says to me
Makes me think the girl's
In need of a family

Est-ce que c'est chic
Ou simplement ordinaire

It's really strange
Everytime I hear her name
Will she always be the same
Just spendin' life in search of fame
You should see the girl
She's such a crazy thing
Every night it's the same old dream
Rehearsing lines for tomorrow's scenes
But it's real in the morning babe

And it's the little things
She says to me
Makes me think the girl's
In need of a family

Est-ce que c'est chic
Ou simplement ordinaire

// Falling In Love With You //

I think of you, honey, night and day
And it's your sweet lovin'

That makes me feel this way
I'm not ashamed, oh no not me

Everyone should know
This is how love should be

And now that I've given you my heart
Please be gentle, baby
When the lovin' starts, cause

Falling in love with you
It's all I want to do
Falling in love with you tonight
Falling in love with you
It's all I want do
Tonight, tonight

I see your picture
I hear your name

I try to hide it, baby
But the feeling's still the same

I see your face, such a warm face
I wanna touch you
Or just feel your embrace

And now that I've given you my heart
Please be gentle, baby
When the lovin' starts, cause

Falling in love with you
It's all I want to do
Falling in love with you tonight
Falling in love with you
It's all I want do
Tonight, tonight
