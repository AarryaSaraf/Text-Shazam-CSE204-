// I Want Your Love //

Do you feel, like you ever want to try my love and see how well it fits?
Baby, can't you see when you look at me?
I can't kick this feeling when it hits
Oh, all alone, in my bed at night
I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight
I think of you
And I dream of you, all of the time
What am I gonna do?

I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, you know I need your love)

You know I need your love, you know I need your love
You know I need your love, you know I need your love
You know I need your love, you know I need your love

I'll share my dreams
And make you see how really bad your love, I need
I want your love, I need your love
Just like the birds needs sky above
I'll share my dreams
And make you see how really bad your love, I need
I'll share my dreams
And make you see how really bad your love, I need

I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, you know I need your love)
I want your love, I want your love
(I want your love, you know I need your love)

I want your love, I want your love
(Have you ever been in love?)
You know I need your love, you know I need your love
You know I want your love, you know I need your love
You know I want your love, you know I need your love
You know I want your love, you know I need your love
You know I want your love, you know I need your love
I want your love, need your love
You know I need your love
I want your love, I want your love

// Till The World Falls //

[Cosha:]
You are now listening to Chic

We keep dancing till' the world falls
Go on and on till' the world falls down
And we can make the world fall down
Hey!

The world has gone mad
We might be safer on the dancefloor
So much destruction in our path
Wake up, wake up
They're comin' back for more, they comin' back for more

It's still real so let's just rock the floor
(And live now like tomorrow never comes)
Loose ourselves tonight, with no remorse
Until forever

We keep dancing till' the world falls
Go on and on till' the world falls down
And we can make the world fall down

Now that the coast is clear, we have no fear
We're the survivors
Wake up because the day is finally here
A new horizon

It's still real so let's just rock the floor
(And live now like tomorrow never comes)
Loose ourselves tonight, with no remorse
Oh baby

We keep dancing till' the world falls
Go on and on till' the world falls down
And we can make the world fall down

[Vic Mensa:]
Let's step out tonight
My feet don't walk, they fly, I dance on clouds tonight
Yeah, with me, a natural high
And it's my birthday
Imma just rock my birthday suit
I take the shirt and the shoes off, the vintage too
Call that my birthday cool
And I wanna be free, wanna feel good to be me
Me, look bitch, I'm a king
I got a dream
I might just call up my team and go skydiving off of my wing
I feel flyer than Maya, I know why the caged bird sings
'Cause you gotta have a song when the world falls down
You don't wanna be alone so we just keep dancing

[Cosha:]
We keep dancing till' the world falls
Go on and on till' the world falls down
And we can make the world fall down

We can go on and on and on
Until the world falls down
We can go on and on and on
Until the world falls down

We keep dancing till' the world falls
Go on and on till' the world falls down
And we can make the world fall down

// Queen //

There was a little girl
Whose daddy called her queen
And life was filled with joy
Or that was how it seems
Her happiness she lost
A broken [?]
Abandoning her trust
And now daddy's not around

Oh, girl, you're a queen
Strong as anything
And when your faith must gone
You still carry on

When she turns sweet sixteen
A boyfriend called her his queen
A stimulating kiss
That felt like in a dream
Then after another dream
And after another [?]
Her body tells the tale
Of her unconsciousness

Oh, girl, you're a queen
Strong as anything
And when your think must gone
You still carry on
Oh, girl, you're a queen
If you just believe
And when your faith must gone
You still carry on

She became a happy wife
Whose husband called her queen
And she believed her life
Was perfect as can be
And when a surprise the walls came down
She rebelled and [?]
The mirror now reveals
What she can finally see

Woman, you're a queen
Strong as anything
And when your faith must gone
You still carry on
You're a queen
If you just believe
[?]
You still carry on
Even if the love's gone

You're a queen
Yes, you know that you are
Even when love's gone
You still carry on
...

Woman, you're a queen
