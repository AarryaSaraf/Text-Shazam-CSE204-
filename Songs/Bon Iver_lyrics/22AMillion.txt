// 22 (OVER S∞∞N) //

It might be over soon, soon, soon
Where you gonna look for confirmation?
And if it's ever gonna happen
So as I'm standing at the station
It might be over soon
(All these years)
There I find you marked in constellation (two, two)
There isn't ceiling in our garden
And then I draw an ear on you
So I can speak into the silence
It might be over soon (two, do, two)
It might be over soon (two, do, two)
(Two, do, two, two, do, two)
(It might be over soon)
(Two, do, two, two, do, two)
(It might be over soon)

(And I'm gonna shout all my trouble over)
Oh and I have carried consecration
And then you expelled all decision
As I may stand up with a vision
Caught daylight, goddamn right
Within our eyes there lies a scission
(It might be over soon)

Fe, fever rest
Fever rest
(Wild heart, wild heart)
I cut you in
Deafening
Fever rest
(Darling didn't love right)
I've been sleeping in a stable, mate
Not gonna do you no favors
What I got is seen you trying
Or take it down the old lanes around
Fuckified
Darling don't make love, fight it
Love, don't fight it
Love, don't fight it
Love...
Well I'll wrap you up
And I take it by the touch
Darling don't a failure fright
Times the raker
And I'll rack it up
I'm unorphaned in our northern lights
Dedicoding every daemon
Taken in the tall grass of the mountain cable
And I cannot seem to find I'm able

Down along the creek
I remember something
Her, the heron hurried away
When first I breeched that last Sunday

Low moon don the yellow road
I remember something
That leaving wasn't easing
All that heaving in my vines
And as certain it is evening 'at is now is not the time
Ooh

Toiling with your blood
I remember something
In B, unrationed kissing on a night second to last
Finding both your hands as second sun came past the glass
And oh, I know it felt right and I had you in my grasp

Oh, then how we gonna cry
Cause it once might not mean something
Love, a second glance it is not something that we'll need
Honey, understand that I have been left here in the reeds
But all I'm trying to do is get my feet out from the crease

And I'll see you

Turn around, you're my A-Team
Turn around now, you're my A-Team
God damn, turn around now, you're my A-Team

(When we leave this room it's gone)
Is the company stalling?
We had what we wanted: your eyes
(When we leave this room it's gone)
With no word from the former
I'd be happy as hell, if you stayed for tea
(I know so well that this is all there is)
This is how we grow now, woman
A child ignored
These will just be places to me now
The foreman is down
(When we leave this room it's gone)
We're rising the stairs

We find God and religions to
Staying at the Ace Hotel
If the calm would allow
Then I would just be floating to you now
It would make me pass to let it pass on
I'm climbing the dash, that skin

(Here in this room, this narrow room where life began when we were young last night)

Well we walked up on that bolt in the street
After you tied me in in the driveway of the apartment of his bede
Sent your sister home in a cab
Said I woulda walked across any thousand lands
(No not really if you can't)
I didn't need you that night
Not gonna need you anytime
Was gonna take it as it goes
I could go forward in the light
Well I better fold my clothes

(I'll be looking through your eyes)
All my goodness
(I'll be looking through your eyes)
(I'll be looking through your eyes)
All my goodness to show
(Why are you so far from saving me?)
(Why are you so far from saving me?)

Sharing smoke
In the stair up off the hot car lot
Sun shine hard on the video spot
Hm, mm, mm, mm

Sure as any living dream
It's not all then what it seems
And the whole thing's hauled away

A womb
An empty robe
Enough
You're rolling up
You're holding it
You're fabric now

Paramind
Paramind

Hallucinating Claire
Nor the snow shoe light or the autumns
Threw the meaning out the door
(Now could you be a friend)
There's no meaning anymore
(Come and kiss me here again)

A womb
An empty robe
Enough
You're rolling up
You're holding it
You're bent prize

Canonize
Canonize

Motor up and yeah, you're own, ooh
And yeah, you're on your own, ooh

Fold the map and mend the gap
And I tow the word companion
And I make my self escape
Oh, the multitude of other
It comes always off the page

I hold the note
You wrote and know
You've buried all your alimony butterflies

Sub find
Some night

// 666 ʇ //

Sixes hang in the door
What kind of shit to ignore
I've cut the cloth
(Ooo, hard line circle)
How to know who to write
How to know who can cull up all the questions
(We know that I'm right, cease)
To clean out a night
I fell in love

I heard about it
I heard about it
I heard about it
No

And so it's not in your clasp
What's the function or the task
Well, I'd stun and I'd stammer
Help me reach the hammer
(For then what will I ask)

That's a pair of them docks
Mooring out two separate lochs
Ain't that some kind of quandary
Take me into your palms
What is left when unhungry

I learned about it
I learned about it
I've learned about it
No

I'm still standing in
Still standing in the need of the prayer
The need of prayer

No, I don't know the path
Or what kind of pith I've amassed
Long lines of questions
Lessons (lessons)
Lessons, lessons

What do you lose to concede?
And yes it's hard to believe
When 'em sold from your sleeve
Just come off of your kneel
Please, please, please

I can admit to conceal
No, that's not how that's supposed to feel
Oh, no
(It's not for broader appeal)
Fuck the fashion of it, dear

I've laughed about it
I've laughed about it
I've laughed about it
No

// 21 M◊◊N WATER //

The math ahead
The math behind it
It's moon water

The math ahead
The math behind
Moon water

Remomrize numb
And half the hum
For moon water

I'd hide Berlin
To run and find it
Moon water

The path ahead
The path behind it
It's moon water

Philosophize your figure
What I have and haven't held
You called and I came, stayed tall through it all
Fall and fixture just the same thing

Say nothing of my fable, no
What on earth is left to come
Who's agonized and gnawed through it all
I'm underneath your tongue

I'm standing in your street now, no
And I carry his guitar
And I can't recall it lightly at all
But I know I'm going in

Too much for me to pick up, no
Not sure what forgiveness is
We've galvanized at the squall of it all
I can leave behind the harbour

I will run
(All around it)
Have to crawl
(Still can't stop it)
Along the fires
One more time just pass me by
Imma make it half the night
Hall light wishes

To walk aside your favor
I'm an Astuary King
I'll keep in a cave your comfort and all
Unburdened and becoming

I will run (all around it) (sailing off and on you're on your honor)
Have to crawl (still can't stop it) (carry off and up your seize)
Along the fires
Carry up love along unfettered time
Now, Mona

Haven't I locked up my failures (sailing off and on you're on your honor)
(From the core to the sky)
Wouldn't I be last to see? (carry off and up your seize)
(From the door till we die)
Deny with love my labour (carry up with love a long)
Atonements defined (was it all I could find?) (we live outside)
Keep waking up high

Well I've been carved in fire
Well I've been caught in fire
I've been caught in fire, whaaaa
Well I've been caught in fire
I've been carved in fire
I've been caught in fire
What comes prior to?

I've been caught in fire
I stayed down the other night
I've been caught in fire
I stayed down
(Without knowing what the truth is)
I've been caught in fire
I stayed down the other night
I've been caught in fire
I stayed down
(Without knowing what the truth is)
Fire
(Fire)

// 00000 Million //

Must've been forces, that took me on them wild courses
Who knows how many poses, that I've been in
But them the main closest, hark! it gives meaning Mine
I cannot really post this, ah feel the signs
I worried about rain and I worried bout lightning
But I watched them off, to the light of the morning
Marking the slope, slung low in the highlands
Where the days have no numbers
If it's harmed, it's harmed me, it'll harm, I let it in

Oh, the old modus: out to be leading live
Said, comes the old ponens, demit to strive
A word about Gnosis: it ain't gonna buy the groceries
Or middle-out locusts, or weigh to find
I worry about shame, and I worry bout a worn path
And I wander off, just to come back home
Turning to waltz, hold high in the lowlands
Cause the days have no numbers
It harms me, it harms me, it harms like a lamb

So I can depose this, partial to the bleeding vines
Suppose you can't hold shit. how high I've been
What a river don't know is: to climb out and heed a line
To slow among roses, or stay behind

I've been to that grove
Where no matter the source is
And I walked it off: how long I'd last
Sore-ring to cope, whole band on the canyon
Cause the days have no numbers
Well it harms it harms me it harms, I'll let it in
