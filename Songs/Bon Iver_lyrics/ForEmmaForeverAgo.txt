// Flume //

I am my mother's only one
It's enough
I wear my garment so it shows
Now you know

Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon

I am my mother on the wall
With us all
I move in water, shore to shore
Nothing's more

Only love is all maroon
Lapping lakes like leery loons
Leaving rope burns, reddish ruse

Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon

// Lump Sum //

Sold my cold knot, a heavy stone
Sold my red horse for a venture home
To vanish on the bow
Settling slow

Fit it all, fit it in the doldrums
Or so the story goes
Color the era
Film it as historical

My mile could not pump the plumb
In my arbor 'till my ardor trumped
Every inner inertia
Lump sum

All at once rushing from the sump-pump
Or so the story goes
Balance we won't know
We will see when it gets warm

// Skinny Love //

Come on skinny love just last the year
Pour a little salt we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer

I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in this moment this order's tall

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different "kind"
I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

Come on skinny love what happened here
Suckle on the hope in light brassiere
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full; so slow on the split

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And now all your love is wasted?
Then who the hell was I?

Now I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines
Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?
Ooh, ooh

// The Wolves (Act I And II) //

Someday my pain
Someday my pain will mark you
Harness your blame
Harness your blame, walk through

With the wild wolves around you
In the morning, I'll call you
Send it farther on

Solace my game
Solace my game, it stars you
Swing wide your crane
Swing wide your crane and run me through

And the story's all over you
In the morning, I'll call you
Can't you find a clue
When your eyes are all painted Sinatra blue

What might have been lost
What might have been lost
What might have been lost
What might have been lost

Don't bother me
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
What might have been lost

Ah, ah

Someday my pain
Someday my pain, my pain
Someday my pain
Someday my pain

// Blindsided //

Back down, down to the downtown
Down to the lockdown...
Boards, nails lie around

I crouch like a crow
Contrast in the snow
For the agony I'd rather know

'Cause blinded
I am blindsided

Peek in
Into the peer in
I'm not really like this
I'm probably plightless

I come through the window
I'm crippled and slow
For the agony I'd rather know

'Cause blinded
I am blindsided

Would you really rush out?
Would you really rush out?
Would you really rush out for me now?
Would you really rush out
Would you really rush out for me now?
Would you really rush out for me now?
Would you really rush out for me now?
Would you really rush out
For me now?

Ooh, for me now
Ooh, for me now
Ooh, for me now

Taut line
Down to the shoreline
The end of a blood line
The moon is a cold light

There's a pull to the flow
My feet melt the snow
For the irony I'd rather know

'Cause blinded
I was blindsided
Blinded
I was blindsided
Blinded
I was blindsided

// Creature Fear //

I was full by your count
I was lost but your fool
Was a long visit wrong?
Say you are the only

So many foreign worlds, so relatively fucked
So ready for us, so ready for us
The creature fear

I was teased by your blouse
Spit out by your mouth
I was loud by your lowered
Seminary sold
Tear on, tail on
Take all on the wind on
The soft bloody nose
Sign another floor

So many territories, ready to reform
Don't let it form us, don't let it form us
The creature fear
So did he foil his own? Is he ready to reform?
So many Torahs, so many for us
The creature fear

// For Emma //

[Narrator:]
"So apropos
Saw death on a sunny snow"

[Him:]
"For every life..."

[Her:]
"Forgo the parable"

[Him:]
"Seek the light"

[Her:]
"...my knees are cold"

Running home
Running home
Running home
Running home

[Her:]
"Go find another lover
To bring a- to string along!"

"With all your lies
You're still very lovable"

"I toured the light
So many foreign roads
For Emma, forever ago"

// re: Stacks //

This my excavation and today is Qumran
Everything that happens is from now on
This is pouring rain
This is paralyzed

I keep throwing it down two-hundred at a time
It's hard to find it when you knew it
When your money's gone
And you're drunk as hell

On your back with your racks as the stacks are your load
In the back and the racks and the stacks of your load
In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load

Well I've been twisting to the sun and the moon
I needed to replace
The fountain in the front yard is rusted out
All my love was down
In a frozen ground

There's a black crow sitting across from me
His wiry legs are crossed
He is dangling my keys, he even fakes a toss
Whatever could it be
That has brought me to this loss?

On your back with your racks as the stacks are your load
In the back and the racks and the stacks of your load
In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load

This is not the sound of a new man or crispy realization
It's the sound of the unlocking and the lift away
Your love will be
Safe with me

// Wisconsin //

You ride in the park and you're peeking
Piss pools in your seat
She's standing inside, but you surely repeat
Oh, God, don't leave me here
I will freeze till the end
Love is love's reprieve

Winter is coming and you're stacking
All your summer sheets
Now when the wind blows you cover your teeth
And our tool shed where you trade in your blues
Love is love's sad news

That was Wisconsin that was yesterday
Now I have nothing that I can keep
'Cause every place I go I take another place with me
Love is love's mystique

You're up on the bar and you're shaking
With every grimy word
Who will you love
What's love when you've hurt
Wherever is your scene the snow kissed the curb
Love is love's return

That was Wisconsin that was yesterday
Now I have nothing that I can keep
'Cause every place I go I take another place with me
Love is love's critique
