// B For Butter //

Do, do, do, do, do, oh, oh, oh

Fret not for tomorrow
'Cause I know there will be no sorrow
Don't matter what the crisis
I will be your rescue

No, I'm not going to take no for that
'Cause I know just where it's at
B for butter and T for tat

When it comes to loving someone, girl, you know
I'm in love with you
When it comes to holding and kissing
Girl, you know I'd do anything for you
