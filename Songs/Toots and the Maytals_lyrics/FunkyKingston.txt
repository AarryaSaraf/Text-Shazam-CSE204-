// Louie Louie //

Louie, Louie, oh baby, I gotta go
Yi, yi, yi, yi, yi
Louie, Louie, oh baby, I gotta go

A fine girl who waited for me
I catch a ship across the sea
I sailed the ship all alone
I wondered when I'm gonna make it home

Louie, Louie, oh baby, I gotta go
Yi, yi, yi, yi, yi
Louie, Louie, oh baby, I gotta go

Three nights and days I sailed the sea
I think of the girl constantly
On the ship, I dream she there
I smell the rose that's in her hair

Louie, Louie, oh baby, I gotta go
Yi, yi, yi, yi, yi
Louie, Louie, oh baby, I gotta go

I see Jamaican moon above
See the girl I'm thinking of
I take her in my arms and then
Say I'll never leave again

Louie, Louie, oh baby, I gotta go
Yi, yi, yi, yi, yi
Louie, Louie, oh baby, I gotta go

Oh, I gotta go now
Uh, huh, I gotta go

// Redemption Song //

I, I've been left waiting
You just keep on going
I got to pray with all my heart
While I sing redemption songs
I got to pray with all my heart
While I sing redemption songs
Jeremiah saw it
Mordecai saw it, oh yeah
Joshua talk it, talk it, talk
Moses preach it
He said, it's just the word
That God speakest from my mouth
That hurts your heart
It's just the word
That God speakest from my mouth
That hurts your heart

I, I've been left waiting
You just keep on going
I got to pray with all my heart
While I sing redemption songs
I got to pray with all my heart
While I sing redemption songs
Jeremiah saw it, uh
Mordecai saw it
Joshua talk it, talk it, talk
Moses preach it
He said, it's just the word
That God speakest from my mouth
That hurts your heart
It's just the word
That God speakest from my mouth
That hurts your heart

// It Was Written Down //

It was written down there by those prophets
It was written down there on the ground
It was written down there by those prophets
It was written down there on the ground
One love, one heart
One eternity, one joy
Come sing a song with me and do your harmony
Go sing a song with me and do your harmony
My father sent me to warn the nation
It was written down there from creation
My father sent me to warn the nation
It was written down there from creation
One love, one heart
One eternity, one joy
Come sing a song with me and do your harmony
Go sing a song with me and do your harmony

// Sit Right Down //

Yeah

I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
And if you ever say goodbye
And if you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you

I'm gonna love you more and more every day
I'm gonna love you more and more every day
And if you ever say goodbye
And if you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you

So they'll know exactly
Just what I'm gonna do

If you ever say goodbye
If you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you

I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you

You're my love
You're my angel
You're the girl of my dreams
And I'd like to thank you
For waiting patiently
Daddy's home, your Daddy's home, to stay
How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had tear drops in you eyes
Daddy's home, your Daddy's home, to stay
It wasn't on a Sunday
(Monday and Tuesday went by)
It wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon
(All I could do was cry)
But I made a promise
That you treasure
And I made it back home to you
How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had tear drops in your eyes
Daddy's home, your Daddy's home, to stay
Daddy's home, to stay
I'm not a thousand miles away
Daddy's home, to stay
And I'm gonna be here come with me
Daddy's home, to stay (Come with me)

Daddy's home, to stay
And I'm gonna be here come with me

// Love Is Gonna Let Me Down //

Everytime that I see your face
Something moves within my heart
And it thrills me to my soul
And tell me that

Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna let me down

As I see the morning sun
I know everything is alright
I could see you rushing to my door
And tell me that

Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna let me down

You told me that
My, my, my, my baby

I can see the morning sun
And knowing that everything, everything is alright
I can see you rushing through the door
And tell me that

Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna walk out on me
Love is gonna let me down
Love is gonna walk out on me
Love is gonna let me down
