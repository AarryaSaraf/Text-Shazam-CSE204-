// Ghetto Vet //

Life....

Niggas used to come and get me

When it was time to disagree with an enemy

Pass the hennessy it gives me energy

Packed the gat in the small of my back

Where these niggas at I clear the whole pack

Talkin' shit cuz I'm down for my set I'm a vet

Smokin' on a wet cigarette

(who these niggas think they are)

(wishin' on a ghetto star I represent my tar)

I start bustin' and they scatter like water bugs

Cuz these westside niggas is harder thugs

Enslve us but nothin' can save us from sportin' Ben Davis

Shootin' at your neighbors

(cuz sometimes I feel like a nut don't give a fuck when I open ya up)

Hot rocks fly from the back seat and

Busta ass niggas run like a track meet

An if you crawl in the middle bleed mo' than a little (what)

Killer king is the hospital

Feelin' numb from the bullets I hum

And when they hit black mothers have fits I don't give a shit

[Chorus]
[Mack 10]

Fool I'm a vet you can bet that

I could dance underwater and not get wet (check it)
[Mr. Short Khop]

Its rainin' bullets and I'm still there

(Foe life) I'm still there

My house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass

Up early in the morning takin' out the trash

Feelin' like a loser alcohol abuser

Two youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser

One on the peddles the other on the handle bars (what)

Tryin' be ghetto stars they said:

Are you from the westside is it so?

I said hell yea and who wanta to know (me)

In slow mo fo' fo' slugs face down in the mud

Puddle full of blood left for dead

The pain starts to spread now I can't feel my legs

I meet doctor who at King Drew medical center

As I enter I.C.U.

He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital

I said I can't move my legs he said don't try to

Now this ain't the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again

I sit there motionless holdin' this pain inside contemplating suicide

At night I jerk and jerk

But my dick don't work it don't even hurt (damn)

Now who'd ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube

I be pissin' through a tube Fool I'm a vet

[Chorus]
[Mack 10]

Fool I'm a vet you can bet that

I could dance underwater and not get wet (check it)
[Mr. Short Khop]

Its rainin' bullets and I'm still there

Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair

Fuck a V-A they need G-A

Gang hospital for a crippal now I'm drinkin' rippal

Same corner same hood I'm still there

With bandanas tied to my wheel chair

To all the hoodrat hoes I'm fired

They mad cuz my tongue get tired

Now everybody wanna put they dope on me

Sayin' I won't get searched by the LAPD

I'm sitting on a doorway duece five

Dependin on that to keep my ass alive

I don't got bows but my arm's about a one-six

My fuckin legs, lookin like tooth picks

Some times I can't deal got to beg the B G's to roll me up the hill

Put me on the porch now I'm on the torch smokin' cocaine

Just to maintain nutin' to gain nutin' to lose

And last night I couldn't make it to the bathroom

Feelin' like a two year old you can't get a sip from the brew I hold

Nigga its the only friend to a stranger AKA hadicap gangbanger

There's a lot in my life I regret becomin' a ghetto vet

Fool I'm a Vet

[Chorus 2X]
[Mack 10]

Fool I'm a vet you can bet that

I could dance underwater and not get wet (check it)
[Mr. Short Khop]

Its rainin' bullets and I'm still there

Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair

Life.....

Yea....

Life...

Yea....

Life... Life....

Dedicated to all the ghetto vets

For every nigga that done took one for the hood

Bumpin' BlackSTREET, treated like a athlete

Life ain't a track meet (no) it's a marathon

Fuck the cemetery that a nigga get buried on

We be clubbing till the day we die

Nigga ask the bartender if you think we lie

But if you think we high, nigga think again

Cause when it's sink or swim

You got to think to win

And if I drink this Hen'

Everybody will know it

Cause I ain't going for it

So pray to the Lord that I don't pull out

Cuss out and bust out

Now all I wanna do is have fun with my loved ones

The thug ones, relatives and my cousins

And I got 'em by the dozen

When they buzzin', quick to say fuck your husband

This is for my niggas locked away

Extra love for the ones who ain't got no date

But when we hit checkmate with Ice Cube the great

As soon as I get a word we can rush the safe

Fuck them license plates because life is great

It don't matter if you're rich and your folks ain't straight

I'm still coming with that underground gangsta shit

No matter how many niggas say we ain't the shit, bitch

I do hard core rhyming, hard time grinding

With will I pimp hoes

Other niggas wine and dine them

Gotta love this pup shit

Passing the mud shit

Pockets on flood shit

OG lyrical blood shit

I don't rent I buy shit

Niggas jealous of my shit

You unaware of this young nigga getting all the fly shit

While you're rooting and recruiting

Nigga 6-8 whooping

I was in the hood shooting cause I had the wife whooping

I come from padres gold in oversized jars

I past up strife and got star awards

No time for playa hating, Mack paper chasing

Came out the substation to the hip hop nation

The mo' hits the mo' bigga with illegal weight figga

Done develop the status of a platinum plus nigga

Bust the first asshole to show I can hit it

I keep pushing, don't quit it

Don't stop till I get it

Freaky gyration is close to fornication

Freaky gyration is close to fornication:

We puttin' it down, constantly

Get your ass up and hurra

// Roll All Day //

[Ice Cube]

I got a full tank of unleaded [repeat x4]

Now we could roll all day, if I could ride all night

I got a full tank of unleaded [repeat]

[Verse 1]

I see you walkin' and I'm damn near stalkin'

You a chicken head and I'm chicken hawkin', now we talkin'

'Bout your unlucky backround

And how your ex-boyfriend is smokin' crack now (why)

I'm very very simpethetic

But baby where you headed?

I got a full tank of unleaded

She got in and had ass for days like

BOOM, BAM, GOD, DAMN!

She aks me would I harm her

No, I'm a charmer

A fuckin' night in shining armour

We went out and had a blast, everytime she walked past

Nigga got a quick fast glimpse of that ass

("what choo wanna do after this?")

I wanna get your tities in my fist

But you wanna kiss

Your mouth might taste like dick (ewww)

And I grew up on bearin' wit, trick

Now we could roll all day, if I could ride all night

I got a full tank of unleaded [repeat]

[Verse 2]

Niggas that I know don't kiss no hoes

Niggas that I know don't buy no clothes

Niggas that I know don't fuck no pros

Niggas that I know roll foots (?) in fours (yeah)

Pull them panties off your hips

Pussy deep as crips

And 'bout as wide as my grip

Never ever get me with that wipper feel

They got a pants full of black steel

Am I too real?

You like dick I know you do

Wanna bring out the hoe in you

I know what you're goin' thru

You already think you're cree-al

You should learn to suck this like Vanessa Del Rio

Aww, you thought I was a nice guy

But shit, I was around eight, with bitches gettin' laid

If I wrap my dick in plastic

Now, how wide can that ass get?

It's gettin' drastic

Now we could roll all day, if I could ride all night

I got a full tank of unleaded [repeat]

[Verse 3]

Should of picked up an old girl that I know

That's what I get for fucking with you young hoes

About to get an attitude, what's hapenin'?

Baby how you actin'?

Let's get it crackin' (c'mon)

No?

Well then bitch you got to go

I put her ass out, on imperial

Hoe slamed my door, next to texico

Kick my lexo, broke my window

Put out my indo

Jumped out and said "bitch are you crazy?"

Fucked around and got lazy

She jumped in my car, took off, now I'm stuck

And all I want to do was fuck

(damn....)

I had to stroll all day, I had to walk all night

I had a full tank of unleaded [repeat]
