Album: Encore

// Oh, Look At Me Now //

I never cared for simple things like love
June and old place
may face was terribly blank
Two things concerning l'amour
I'm really, really not for sure

For I'm not the guy who kid about love
For I'm not the guy who kid about fortunes and such
Never cared much, but, Oh look at me now
I never knew the technique of kissing
I never knew the thrill I could get from your touch
Never cared much, but, Oh look at me now

I'm a new man, better than Cassanova at his best
With a new heart a brand new start
I'm so proud I'm busting my best
So I'm a guy who turned out a lover
So I'm  guy who laughed at those blue diamond rings
One of those things
Never cared much, but, Oh look at me now

I'm a new man, better than Cassanova at his best
With a new heart a brand new start
I'm so proud I'm busting my best
So I'm a guy who turned out a lover
So I'm  guy who laughed at those blue diamond rings
One of those things
Never cared much, but, Oh look at me now

// Someday //

I know that someday you want me to want you
When I'm in love with somebody new
You expect me to be true
and to keep on loving you
Although I am blue,
you think I can't forget you

Although you don't want to meet now
I'll get along somehow
And I won't want you

// Along The Navaho Trail //

Every day a lullabout evening
When the sunlights beginning to fail
I ride through the slumbering shadows
Along the Navajo Trail

When it's night and crickets are calling
And coyotes are making a wail
I dream by a smouldering fire
Along the Navajo Trail

[part 3]
When the wind is strumming a sage-brushed guitar
And over yonder hill the moon is climbing
It always finds me whistling on a star
What do you know it's morning already
There's the dawning, so silver and pale
It's time to climb in my saddle
I want to ride the Navajo Trail

I love the lie and listen to all the music
[repeat part 3]
I want to ride the Navajo Trail

with fellows like Maverick and Cheyenne,
the Indians and their bow and arrows
the boys and guns and love to travel
along the Navajo Trail

// Running Wild //

No girl will ever make a fool of me
No girl, I mean just what I say
I'm not the simpleton I used to be
Wonder how I got that way

I'm running wild, I've lost control
Running wild, mighty bold
Feeling gay, reckless too
Every mile all the time, never blue
Always going don't go there
Always showing I don't care
Don't love nobody, it's not worthwhile
I'm all alone, running wild
[repeat verse]

// Accentuate The Positive //

You've got to accentuate the positive
eliminate the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
But don't mess with mister inbetween

You've got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
have faith, a pandemonium
Libel to walk up on the scene

To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the Whale, Noah in the ark
What did they do
just when everything looked so dark

They said we better
accentuate the positive
eliminate the negative
latch on to the affirmative
But don't mess with mister inbetween

[One more Time]

To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark
What did they do
just when everything looked so dark
don't mess, don't mess, don't mess
with mister inbetween

[this verse twice]

// Mary, Mary Lou //

Mary, Mary Lou
Why must you do
The things that you always do

Honey, I've been here a-crying
Sipping and a-sighing
To think it's all because of you

I know the other night you told me
You were gonna marry
Someone who's in love with you, yeah
And the time I used to
be your golden rooster
But now I can see that we are through

Mary, Mary, Mary Lou
What in the world is the matter with you
You're always doing me so wrong

Mary, Mary, Mary Lou
What in the world is the matter with you
And know you want to say so long

Mary, Mary Lou
Why must you do
Those things that you always do

I can hear a-crying
Sipping and a-sighing
To think it's all because of you

You were gonna marry
Someone who's in love with you, yeah
And the time I used to
be your golden rooster
But now I can see that we are through

Mary, Mary, Mary Lou
What in the world is the matter with you
You're always doing me so wrong

Mary, Mary, Mary Lou
What in the world is the matter with you
And knew you want to say so long

Mary, Mary, Mary Lou
What in the world is the matter with you
Mary, Mary, Mary Lou
What in the world is the matter with you

// I Cover The Waterfront //

I cover the waterfront
Iâm watching to see
Will the one I love, soon come back to me

I cover the waterfront
I search of my love
And Iâm guided by the starlit sky above

Here am I, patiently waiting
Hoping and longing O, how I yearn
Where are you, are you forgetting
Do you remember, will you return

I cover the waterfront
Iâm watching to see
Will the one I love, soon come back to me

I cover the waterfront
Iâm watching to see
Will the one I love, soon come back to me

I cover the waterfront
I search of my love
And Iâm guided by the starlit sky above

Here am I, patiently waiting
Hoping and longing O, how I yearn
Where are you, are you forgetting
Do you remember, will you return

I cover the waterfront
Iâm watching to see
Will the one I love, soon come back to me

Here am I, patiently waiting
Hoping and longing O, how I yearn
Where are you, are you forgetting
Do you remember, will you return

I cover the waterfront

// My Foolish Heart //

The night is like a lovely tune
beware my foolish heart
How wise the ever constant moon
take care my foolish heart
There's a line between love and fascination
that's hard to see on an evening such as this
For they both give the very same sensation
when you're lost in the magic of a kiss
her lips are much too close to mine
beware my foolish heart
But should her eager lips meet mine
then let the fire start
For this time it isn't fascination
Nor a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
my foolish heart

// Today I Sing The Blues //

Without a warning
the blues walked in this morning
And circled round my lonely room
I didn't know why I had
that sad and lonely feeling
'till my baby called and said it's through
Yesterday I sang a love song
but today I sing the blues

I know the explanation
but that's no constellation
No matter how your love
you can lose
and since I lost
I rather walk around and worry
I guess I've walked the darkest avenue

Yesterday I sang a love song
but today I sing the blues
Now it strikes me kind of funny
how life can be this way
We were lovers last night honey
but not in love today
Now it strikes me kind of funny
how faith can be unfair
it seems that I'm the one
to lose in every love affair
Yes it must be written for me
That I should be the one to always lose
Yesterday I sang a love song
but today I sing the blues

Now it strikes me kind of funny
how life can be this way
We were lovers last night honey
but not in love today
Now it strikes me kind of funny
how faith can be unfair
it seems that I'm the one
to lose in every love affair
Yes it must be written for me
That I should be the one to always lose
Yesterday I sang a love song
but today I sing the blues

// It's The Talk Of The Town //

I can't show my face,
can't go any place
People stop and stare
it's hard to bare
Everybody knows you left me
you left me
It's the talk of the town

Every time we meet
my heart skips a beat
We don't stop to speak
tough it's been a week
It's the talk of the town

We send our invitations
to friends and relations
Announcing our wedding day
Friends and relations
send congratulations
How can I face them
What can I say
Let's make up sweetheart
we can't stay apart
Don't let foolish pride
keep you from my side
How can a love like ours be ending
It's the talk of the town
