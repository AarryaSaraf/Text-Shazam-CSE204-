// When I Fall In Love //

Maybe I'm old fashioned, feeling as I do
Maybe I am living in the past
But when I meet the right one
I know that I'll be true
My first love will be the last

When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love is ended before it began
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never, never, never give my heart
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
Is when I give my heart to you

// Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out //

Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends
And I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again,
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again
Here they all come telling you
Their your old long-lost friend
And this I wanna tell you and about it I have no doubt
Nobody wants you
Nobody needs you
Nobody wants when you're down and out
