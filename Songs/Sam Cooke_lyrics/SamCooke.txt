// The Lonesome Road //

look down, look down
that lonesome road
before you travel on
look up, look up
and see you maker
for Gabriel blows his horn

I get weary toting such a load
traveling down that lonesome road
look down, look down
that lonesome road
before you travel on
look down, look down
that lonesome road
before you travel on

look up, look up
and see you maker
for Gabriel blows his horn

I get weary toting such a load
traveling down that lonesome road
look down, look down
that lonesome road
before you travel on
look down, look down
that lonesome road
before you travel on

// Ol' Man River //

Rolling along, rolling along, rolling along
Hm, old man river, that old man river
He don't say nothing, but he must know something
For old man river, he just keeps rolling along
He don't plant taters, he don't pick cotton
And them that plants em they're soon forgotten
While old man river, he jest keeps rolling along

You and me, we sweat and strain
Body all aching and racked with pain
Towed that bargem lift the bail
Get a little drunk and you land in jail
In get weary and sick of trying
I'm tired of living and afraid of dying
While old man river he just keeps rolling along

// Moonlight In Vermont //

Pennies in a stream
Falling leaves
A sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont

I see finger waves
Ski-trails on a mountain side
Snow-light in Vermont

Telegraph cables they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely evening summer breeze
Wobbling above that old lark
Moonlight In Vermont

(Pennies on a stream,
pennies, pennies, pennies on a stream)

Pennies in a stream
Falling leaves
A sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont

I see finger waves
Ski-trails on a mountain side
Snow-light in Vermont

Telegraph cables they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely evening summer breeze
Wobbling above that old lark
Moonlight In Vermont

You and I and moonlight in Vermont

// Canadian Sunset //

Once I was alone
So so lonely and then
You came out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills
Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, so warm, warm were your lips
Out there on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada
A change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you
And in your eyes
I found a love I couldn´t ignore
Down, down came the sun
Fast fast fast beat my heart
I knew, when the sunset
From that day we´d never part

A weekend in Canada
A change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you
And in your eyes
I found a love that I couldn´t ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast fast so fast fast beat my heart
I knew, when the suns et
From that day we´d never part
we´d never part, we´d never part

// Around The World //

Around the world I searched for you
I traveled on but hope was gone
to keep a rendez-vous

I knew sometime, some place, some how
you'd look at me, and I would see the smile
you're smiling now

it might have been in ...
or in New York, or in Paris, or even London town
no longer will I go all around the world
for I've found my world in you

(with background vocals)
Around the world I searched for you
I traveled on but hope was gone
to keep a rendez-vous

I knew somewhere, some time, some how
you'd look at me, and I would see the smile
you're smiling now

it might have been in ...
or in New York, or in Paris, or even London town
no longer will I go all around the world
for I've found my world in you
I've found my world, found my world in you

// Ain't Misbehavin' //

No one to walk with, all by myself,
No one to talk with, but I'm happy on the shelf.
Ain't Misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you

I know for certain the one I love
I'm thru with flirtin', it's just you I'm thinkin' of,
Ain't Mis-be-hav-in', I'm savin' my love for you

I'm Like Jack Horner  in the corner,
I don't go nowhere,  what do I care,
Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me

I don't stay out late, no place to go
I'm home a-bout eight, just me and my radio
Ain't Mis-be-hav-in', savin' all of my love for you

No one to walk with, all by myself,
No one to talk with, but I'm happy on the shelf.
Ain't Misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you

I know for certain the one I love
I'm thru with flirtin', it's just you I'm thinkin' of,
Ain't Mis-be-hav-in', I'm savin' my love for you

I'm like Jack Horner in the corner,
I don't go nowhere,  what do I care,
Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me

I don't stay out late, that's not for me
I'm home about eight, just quit looking at my tv
Ain't Mis-be-hav-in', savin' all of my love for you

// The Bells Of St. Mary's //

The bells of St. Mary's
I hear they are calling
the young loves, the true loves
who come from the sea

And so my beloved
when red leaves are falling
the love bells are shell
ring out, ring out
for you and me

the bells of st mary's
I hear they are calling
the young loves, the true loves
who come from the sea

And so my beloved
when red leeves are falling
the love bells shell
ring out, ring out
for you and me

// So Long //

so long, so long
jee, I hate to see you go
you mean the world to me you know
you've been mine so long

so long, so long
hope we meet again some day
if we do I hope you'll say
darling, my mind was wrong

all alone with my memories of you
I hope you are lonely too
you're my own
even though we're oh so far apart
I shall keep you here in my heart

so long, though you leave me and I cry?
this will never be goodbye
you've been mine so long

all alone with my memories of you
I hope you are lonely too
you're my own
even though we're oh so far apart
I shall keep you here in my heart

so long, though you leave me in a pry?
this will never be goodbye
you've been mine so long

// Danny Boy //

Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling
It's you it's you must go, I must bide

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
it's I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so

Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling
It's you it's you must go, I must bide

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
it's I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so

// That Lucky Old Sun //

Up in the morning, out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
While that lucky old sun has nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day

I have to fuss with my woman
toil for my kids
Sweat 'till I'm wrinkled and raid
While that lucky old sun has nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day

The Lord above don't you know I'm pining
tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with the silver lining
lift me to paradise
show me that river, take me across
Wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun
give me nothing to do
Than roll around heaven all day

The Lord above don't you know I'm plying
tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with the silver lining
lift me to paradise
show me that river, take me across
Wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun
give me nothing to do
Than roll around heaven all day
