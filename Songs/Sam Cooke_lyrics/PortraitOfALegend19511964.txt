// You Send Me //

Darling you send me
I know you send me
Darling you send me
Honest you do, honest you do
Honest you do, whoa

You thrill me
I know you, you, you thrill me
Darling you, you, you, you thrill me
Honest you do

At first I thought it was infatuation
But wooh, it's lasted so long
Now I find myself wanting
To marry you and take you home, woah

You, you, you, you send me
I know you send me
I know you send me
Honest you do

Whoa, whenever I'm with you
I know, I know, I know when I'm near you
Mmm hmm, mmm hmm, honest you do, honest you do
Whoa, I know

I know, I know, I know, when you hold me
Whoa, whenever you kiss me
Mmm hmm, mmm hmm, honest you do

At first I thought it was infatuation
But wooh, it's lasted so long
Now I find myself wanting
To marry you and take you home

I know, I know, I know, you send me
I know you send me
Whoa, you you you you send me
Honest you do

// Summertime //

(Don't cry)

(Don't cry)
(No)
(No)
(No)
(No)
(Don't cry)
(Don't cry)

It's summertime and the living is easy
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
Your daddy's rich and your mama's good looking
Hush little baby
Don't you cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
No
No
No
No
Don't cry
Don't cry

One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
You spread your wings and take to the sky
But until that morning there is nothing can harm you
With your daddy and mommy standing by
They are standing by
I know
Don't cry

Summertime
Summertime
Summertime and the living is
Living is easy
Fish are
I know the fish are jumping and cotton is so high
Your daddy is so
So rich and your mama good
She had to be good looking
So hush little baby
Don't you cry
Don't you cry
No
No
Don't cry
No need to cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Summertime
Summertime

// Wonderful World //

Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the French I took

But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me, too
What a wonderful world this would be

Don't know much about geography
Don't know much trigonometry
Don't know much about algebra
Don't know what a slide rule is for

But I do know one and one is two
And if this one could be with you
What a wonderful world this would be

Now, I don't claim to be an A student
But I'm trying to be
For maybe by being an A student, baby
I can win your love for me

Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the French I took

But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me, too
What a wonderful world this would be

La ta ta ta ta ta ta (History)
Hmm-mm-mm (Biology)
La ta ta ta ta ta ta (Science book)
Hmm-mm-mm (French I took)

Yeah, but I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me, too
What a wonderful world this would be

// You Were Made For Me //

A fish was made to swim in the ocean
A boat was made to sale on the sea
As sure as there are stars above,
I know I know you were made for me
You were made for me.
A grape was made to grow on a vine
An apple was made to grow on a tree
As sure as there are stars above,
I know I know you were made for me

We'll have our quarrels and you will upset me
But what can I do?
You've been mine ever since I met you and I'll never leave you
No I'll never leave you
As sure as there's a heaven up above me,
From you I know I'll never be free.
As sure as there are stars above,
I know I know you were made for me.

Never leave you.

// Chain Gang //

(Hoh! Ah!) I hear something saying (Hoh! Ah!)

(Hoh! Ah!)(Well don't you know)
That's the sound of the men,
Working on the chain, ga-ang
That's the sound of the men,
Working on the chain, gang

All day long they're singing (Hoh! Ah!)

(Well don't you know)
That's the sound of the men,
Working on the chain, ga-ang
That's the sound of the men,
Working on the chain, gang

All day long they work so hard till the sun is going down
Working on the highways and byways and wearing, wearing a frown
You hear they moaning their lives away
Then you hear somebody say

That's the sound of the men,
Working on the chain, ga-ang
That's the sound of the men,
Working on the chain, gang

Can't you hear them singing, mmm (Hoh! Ah!)
I'm going home one of these days
I'm going home, see my woman
Whom I love so dear
But meanwhile I gotta work right here

(Well don't you know)
That's the sound of the men,
Working on the chain, ga-ang
That's the sound of the men,
Working on the chain, gang

All day long they're singing, mmm (Hoh! Ah!)
My work is so hard
Give me water
I'm thirsty, my work is so hard
Woah ooo
My work is so hard

// Twistin' The Night Away //

Let me tell you 'bout a place
Somewhere up-a New York way
Where the people are so gay
Twistin' the night away
Here they have a lot of fun
Puttin' trouble on the run
Man, you find the old and young
Twistin' the night away

They're twistin', twistin'
Everybody's feelin' great
They're twistin', twistin'
They're twistin' the night away

Here's a man in evening clothes
How he got here, I don't know, but
Man, you oughta see him go
Twistin' the night away
He's dancin' with a chick in slacks
She's movin' up and back
Oh, man, there ain't nothin' like
Twistin' the night away

They're twistin', twistin'
Everybody's feelin' great
They're twistin', twistin'
They're twistin' the night

Let's twist a while
Lean up
Lean back
Lean up
Lean back
Watusi
Now fly
Now twist
They're twistin' the night away

Here's a fella in blue jeans
Dancin' with an older queen
Who's dolled up in her diamond rings and
Twistin' the night away
Man, you oughta see her go
Twistin' to the rock and roll
Here you find the young and old
Twistin' the night away

They're twistin', twistin', man
Everybody's feelin' great
They're twistin', twistin'
They're twistin' the night

One more time
Lean up
Lean back
Lean up
Lean back
Watusi
Now fly
Now twist

// Sugar Dumpling //

Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way (way-way-way!)
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger every day, yeah

Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way (way-way-way!)
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger every day

Now listen while I tell you a story
A story about my girl
Oh I call her sugar dumpling because
She's the sweetest things in this world

Oh and whenever I-I'm feeling bad
Right away she puts me to bed
She hires two nurses, one to hold my hand
The other one to rub my head
Let 'em rub it, but

Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way (way-way-way!)
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger every day

Now whenever I'm hungry
I tell her fix me something to eat
And oh, she rushes in the kitchen and fixes me a dinner
With seven different kinds of meat
And oh, whenever I call at two in the morning
And say, come on over if you can
Before I hang up the telephone, ahe's sitting beside me
With a cup of coffee in her hand
Gimme that coffee 'cause

Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
I love you in every way (way-way-way!)
Sugar dumpling, you're my baby
My love grows stronger every day

Sugar dumpling, oh yeah...
