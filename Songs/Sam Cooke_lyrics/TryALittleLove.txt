// Tammy //

I hear the cottonwoods whispering above 
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy's in love! 
The old hootie owl hootie-hoo's to the dove 
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy's in love! 
Does my darling feel what I feel 
When he comes near? 
My heart beats so joyfully 
you'd think that he could hear! 
Wish I knew if he knew what I'm dreaming of! 
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy's in love! 

Whippoorwill, whippoorwill, you and I know 
Tammy! Tammy! Can't let him go! 
The breeze from the bayou keeps murmuring low 
Tammy! Tammy! You love him so! 
When the night is warm, soft and warm 
I long for his charms! 
I'd sing like a violin 
if I were in his arms 
Wish I knew if he knew what I'm dreaming of! 
Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's in love!

// The Gypsy //

In a quaint caravan there's a lady they call the gypsy
She can look in the future and drive away all your fears
Everyone of your fears
Everything will come right if you'll only believe the gypsy
She could tell at a glance that my heart was so full of tears

She looked in my hand and told me my love was always true
But yet in my hearts I knew dear somebody else was kissing you
But I'll go there again cause I want to believe the gypsy
That my lover is true and will come back to me someday

She looked in my hand and told me my love was always true
But yet in my hearts I knew dear somebody else was kissing you
But I'll go there again cause I want to believe the gypsy
That my lover is true and will come back to me someday

// Almost In Your Arms //

You're here, that moment's near,
I'm almost in your arms
Tonight, the mood is right,
I'm almost in your arms

One sigh, one word
and I will rush to your embrace
Say that certain word,
sigh that certain sigh
And with all my heart,
to your arms I'll fly
It's strange, how we are changed
by things that seem so small
One look can write a book,
one touch can say it all

We know those nights alone,
and now we found our way
I'm almost in your arms,
nearly in your arms to stay

[repeat first and last verse]

// You're Always On My Mind //

You're always my mind
Instilled in my heart
You're always on my mind
Although we are apart
You're always, always
Always on my mind

Baby, the reason why I know
I can't forget your face
Cause everywhere I go
I see you everyplace
You're always, always
Always on my mind

Life is so empty
Along with a broken heart
Please, please tell me
Honey, why did we have to part

You know it's you I love
To my heart you hold the key
I pray the stars above
That you hurry back to me
You're always, always
You're always on my mind
