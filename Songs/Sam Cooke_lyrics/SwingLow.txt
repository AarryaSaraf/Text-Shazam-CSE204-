Album: SwingLow

// Swing Low, Sweet Chariot //

Ooo, aaaa
(coming for to carry home) [x2]
Now swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
swing low, sweet chariot
right now
swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
swing low, sweet chariot

I looked over Jordan what did I see
Coming for to carry me home
I saw a band of angels coming after me
That's when I told them
Swing low, sweet chariot [x2]
If you get there before I do
Tell all of my friends I'm coming on too
Swing Low, sweet chariot [x2]
Sometimes I'm up
Sometimes I'm down
Sometimes I'm almost to the ground

// I'm Just A Country Boy //

(I've got silver in the stars
And gold in the morning sun)

I ain't gonna marry in the fall
I ain't gonna marry in the spring
Oh, for I am love with a pretty little girl
Who wears a diamond ring

And I am just a country boy, money have I none
Oh, but I've got silver in the stars
And gold in the morning sun
I have gold in the morning sun

I never gonna kiss the ruby lips
Of the prettiest girl in town
Oh, I'm never gonna ask her if she'd marry me
'Cause I know she'd turn me down

'Cause I am just a country boy
Money, money have I none
Oh, but I've got that silver in the stars
And gold in the morning sun
I have gold in the morning sun

// They Call The Wind Marīa //

Way out west, they got a name
For rain and wind and fire
The rain is Tess, the fireâs joe and
They call the wind MarÄ«a

O no, MarÄ«a blows the stars around
And sends the clouds a-flying
MarÄ«a makes the mountain sounds
Like folks were up there dying
MarÄ«a, They call the wind MarÄ«a

Now before I knew MarÄ«a's name
And heard her wail and whining
I had a girl and she had me
And the sun was always shining
O, but then one day I left my girl
I left her far behind me
And now Iâm lost, Iâm oh so lost
Not even God can find me

MarÄ«a, O, MarÄ«a, They call the wind MarÄ«a
I hear they got a name for rain
and wind and fire only
but when youâre lost and all alone
there ainât no words but lonely
And Iâm a lost and lonely man
Without a star to guide me
MarÄ«a, blow your love to me
I need my girl beside me
He, MarÄ«a, O, MarÄ«a
Iâm lonely canât you see
MarÄ«a, O, MarÄ«a
Please blow my love to me
MarÄ«a, blow my love to me

// Twilight On The Trail //

When it's twilight on the trail,
And I jog along, 
The world is like a dream 
And the ripple of the stream is my song...

When it's twilight on the trail,
And I rest once more, 
My ceiling is the sky 
And the grass on which I lie is my floor...

Never ever have a nickel in my jeans,
Never ever have a debt to pay, 
Still I understand what real contentment means, 
Guess I was born that way...

When it's twilight on the trail,
And my voice is still, 
Please plant this heart of mine 
Underneath the lonesome pine on the hill...

// If I Had You //

If I had you honey
I'd be happy
If I had you
how happy I would be

If I had you, sweetheart
I'd be so happy
how I wish you'd belong to me
If I had you
I know I have riches
If I had you
how rich I would be
If I had you, baby
I have so many riches
how I wish you belong to me

Baby, baby
don't you hear me calling
If I had you I know
I'd be happy
If I had you, baby
how happy I would be
If I had you
I'd be so happy
how I wish you belong to me
how happy I would be
if you belong to me

// Grandfather's Clock //

tick tock, tick tock [x4]

now my grandfathers' clock
was too large for the shelf 
so it stood 90 years on the floor
it was taller by half than the old man himself
though it weighed not a pennyweight more

now it was bought on the morn
of the day that he was born
and it was always his treasure and pride
but it stopped short never to go again
when the old man died

oh now my grandfather said
that of those he could hire
not a servant so faithful he found
for it wasted no time
and it had but one desire
atn the close of each week to be wound
and it kept in its place
not a frown on his face
and his hands never hung by its side
but you know that it stopped short
never to go again
when the old man died

now rang an alarm
in the dead of the night
an alarm that for years had been dumb
and we that his spirit
was 'plumming' for flight
that his hour for departure had come

still that clock kept the time
with a soft and muffled chime
as we solemnly stood by his side
but you know that it stopped short
never to go again
when the old man died

you know that it stopped short
never to go again
when the old boy died

// Jeanie With The Light Brown Hair //

I dream of Jeanie with the light brown hair
Borne like a vapor, on the summer's air
I see her tripping where the bright streams play
Happy as the daisies that dance on her way

Many were the wild notes her merry voice would pour
Many were the blithe birds that warbled them o'er
I dream of Jeanie with the light brown hair
Floating, like a vapor on the soft summer air

I long for Jeanie with the day dawn smile
Radiant in gladness, warm winning guile
I hear her melodies, like joys gone by
Sighing round my heart o'er the fond hopes that die
Sighing like the night wind and sobbing like the rain
Wailing for the lost one that comes not again
I long for Jeanie and my heart bows low
Nevermore to find her where the bright waters flow

// Long, Long Ago //

Tell me the tales that to me were so dear
and sing me the songs I delighted to hear

Now you are come all my grieve is removed
let me forget that so long you have roved
let me believe that you love as you loved

and now do you remember the path where we met
yeah you told me you never would forget

then to all others my smile you preferred
love when you spoke gave a charm to each word
still my heart treasures the praises I heard

though by your kindness my fond hopes were raised
I know you've by more eloquent lips have been praised
but by long absence your truth has been tried
still to your accents I listened with pride
blessed as I was when I set by your side
long, long ago
long ago

// Pray //

O pray when you're feeling low
when the ill wind blows
don't forget to pray

pray when you go to bed
for your daily bread
don't forget to pray

you can awake to beautiful morning
when you got troubles remember this warning
and pray until judgement day
God the devil to pay
if you never pray

pray, lalalalala
pray, lalalalala

you can awake to beautiful morning
when you got troubles remember this warning
and pray until judgement day
God the devil to pay
if you never pray

if you'd only pray

// You Belong To Me //

All of my love belongs to you
All of my love belongs to you
All of my love belongs to you
Because you, you belong to me

Even my hands belong to you
I use my hands oh to work for you
Even my hands belong to you
Because you, you belong to me

You gave me love and swore by stars above
You'd be with me all the way
You've been so good to me
That I can plainly see the reason why I say

Oh, even my voice belongs to you
I use my voice oh to sing, to sing, to sing to you
Even my voice belongs, belongs to you
Because you, you belong to me

Oh, you gave me love and swore by stars above
You'd be with me all the way
You've been so good to me
That I can plainly see the reason why I say

Even my voice belongs to you
I use my voice oh to sing, to sing, to sing to you
Even my, my, my, my, my, my, my voice belongs to you
Because you, you belong, you belong to me
Because you, you belong to me

// Goin' Home //

goin' home
goin' home
I'm a going on
quiet like some still day
I'm just going home

It's not far
It's just close by
through an open door
work all done
care laid by
going to fear no more

mother's there
expecting me
father's waiting too
lot's of folk
gathered there
all the friends I knew
all the friends I knew

nothing loss of days
no more fret or pain
no more stumblin on the way
no more longing for the day
going to roam no more

that morning star lights the way
restless dream all done
shadows gone
break off day
my real life just began
I'm a going home
I'm a going home
I'm a going home
