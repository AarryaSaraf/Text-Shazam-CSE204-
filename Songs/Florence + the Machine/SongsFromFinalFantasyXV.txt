// Too Much Is Never Enough //

And the crownâ€”it weighs heavy
'Til it's banging on my eyelids

Retreating in covers and closing the curtains
One thing's for certain, oh
A year like this passes so strangely
Somewhere between sorrow and bliss

Oh, who decides from where up high?
I couldn't say, "I need more time."
Oh, grant that I can stay the night
Or one more day inside this life

Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never, never, never enough

Oh, you wondrous creature
Coming up who we are

'Cause I'm retreating in covers and closing the curtains
One thing's for certain, oh
A year like this passes so strangely
Somewhere between sorrow and bliss

And who decides from where up high?
(one other year; a hundred flags flying in a field)
I couldn't say, "I need more time."
(one day, felt it let go of me)
Oh, grant that I can stay the night
(one other year; a hundred flags flying in a field)
Or one more day inside this life
(one day, felt it let go of me)

Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never, never, never enough

And who cares about the thing I did that night?
So what? Maybe Luna had it right
And who cares if I'm coming back alive?
So what? 'Least I have the strength to fight

Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never enough
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Never, never, never enough

One other year; a hundred flags flying in a field
One day, felt it let go of me
One other year; a hundred flags flying in a field
One day, felt it let go of me
A hundred flags flying in a field
One day, felt it let go of me
One other year; a hundred flags flying in a field
One day, felt it let go of me

// Stand By Me //

When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see
No, I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So, darling, darling, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darling, darling, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me

And, darling, darling, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me?
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me

Darling, darling, stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me?
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me

// I Will Be //

I will be...

Silence will not cover me...

I will be...

And silence will not cover me...
