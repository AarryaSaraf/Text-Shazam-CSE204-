// Lady And Man //

Momma ain't cheap but I could've been had
I went to college
I could've been a doctor, could've been a lawyer
Oh, come on, not that again!

Cheap but I could've been had
I went to college
I could've been a doctor, could've been a lawyer
Oh, come on, not that again!

You're too angry, you're too fake
You're too reckless, you're too bothered
You're too angry, you're too fake
You're too reckless, you're too bothered
You're too angry, you're too fake
You're too reckless, you're too bothered
You're too angry, you're too fake
You're too reckless, you're too bothered

// Friday Morning //

You are pretty colors
Find you in the morning

You get lonely when it's cold
But you got fire, ooh
Find you, find me
Let's go and burn together, ooh

One dream to another
I'll fall, you come with me

You get lonely when it's cold
But you got fire, ooh
Find you, find me
Let's go and burn forever, ooh

Na, na, na, na...
