// Time (You And I) //

That's life
If we had more time
We could live forever
Just you and I
We could be together
That's life
If we had more time
We could live forever
Just you and I
We could be together
That's life

We can play like children play
We can say like children say
Just you and I
Have we got the time
We can wise when we grow old
Get slow when we grow old
Just you and I
Have we got the time
Do you know
Here we go

That's life (time)
If we had more time
We could live forever (forever)
Just you and I (just you and I)
We could be together
That's life (time)
If we had more time
We could live forever (forever)
Just you and I (just you and I)
We could be together
That's life

We can rhyme like children rhyme
We can time like children time
Just you and I
Have we got the time
Make a plan for when we old
Reminisce when we get old
Just you and I
Have we got the time
Do you know
Here we go

That's life
Oooh ooh ooh
We can now
When we are here
We can then
When we are there
Ooh ooh ooh
We can now
When we are here
We can then
When we are there
We are here
We are there

That's life (time)
If we had more time
We could live forever (forever)
Just you and I (you and I)
We could be together
That's life (hora)
If we had more time
We could live forever (la vida)
Just you and I (you and I)
We could be together
That's life (pour)
If we had more time
We could live forever (toujours)
Just you and I (c'est la vie)
We could be together
That's life (vita)
If we had more time
We could live forever (amore)
Just you and I (qui!)
We could be together (suonare)
That's life

// Connaissais De Face //

It makes me think of that place
I remember, we used to listen to that song, days on end
I couldn't get it out of my head
Oh, well, it brings back memories
Have you heard from Josephine?
She was always running
And I was always swimming
Hah, I would've loved to swim but I had to work
Who do you remember?
I remember John and Daria
He asked me to marry him
Ugh, I'm not surprised

Tu nous connaissais de face
Tu nous
Connaissais pas par nom
Tu nous connaissais de face
Tu nous
Connaissais pas par nom

Tu nous connaissais de face
Tu nous
Connaissais pas par nom

Tu nous connaissais de face
Tu nous
Connaissais pas par nom

Tu nous connaissais de face

Tu nous connaissais de face
Tu nous connaissais de face
Tu nous connaissais de face

// If There Is No Question //

We cried
From laughing
I'll go

You're not crazy
You're not crazy

Hearts will
Get broken
I'll go
With you

You're not crazy
You're wild
But you're not crazy

We're all in this world
Promises won't last
If there is no answer

Broken
And perfect
I'll go

You're not crazy
You're not crazy

The glass
Will shatter
I'll go
With you

You're not crazy
You're wild
But you're not crazy

We're all in this world
Promises won't last
If there is no question

Broken
Can't laugh at
I'll go

You're not crazy
You're not crazy

The glass
Will shatter
I'll go
With you

You're not crazy
You're wild
But you're not crazy

You're not crazy
You're wild
But you're not crazy

You're not crazy
You're wild
But you're not crazy

You're not crazy
You're wild
But you're not crazy

You're not crazy
You're not crazy
You're not crazy

You're not crazy
You're wild
But you're not crazy

You're not crazy
You're not crazy

// Pelota //

Soy una pelota
Una pelota de hollÃ­n
You estaba perdido
En una casa surreal
Me convertÃ­ un demonio
Quien tuve una semilla
La semilla fue arrancada
Por la ayuda de me familia

Ahorita yo
Puedo ser una pelota
Ahorita yo
Puedo ser una pelota
Ahorita yo
Puedo ser una pelota
Ahorita yo
Puedo ser una pelota

Ayyyy
Yo quiero ser pura
Yo quiero ser pura Vera
Pedro quiero amar el disastre
El disastre que es mÃ­o
Mmm
Yo quiero cavar
Encontrar el camino
Y despues, lo quiero entrar
No quiero correr de este paseo
Y despues, lo quiero entrar
No quiero correr de este paseo

Ahorita yo
Puedo ser una pelota
Ahorita yo
Puedo ser una pelota
Ahorita yo
Puedo ser una pelota
Ahorita yo
Puedo ser una pelota

Ahorita yo
Puedo ser una pelota
Ahorita yo
Puedo ser una pelota
Ahorita yo
Puedo ser una pelota
Ahorita yo
Puedo ser una pelota

Ayyyy
Yo quiero ser pura
Yo quiero ser pura Vera
Pedro quiero amar el disastre
El disastre que es mÃ­o
Mmm
Yo quiero cavar
Encontrar el camino
Y despues, lo quiero entrar
No quiero correr de este paseo
Y despues, lo quiero entrar
No quiero correr de este paseo
Y despues, lo quiero entrar
No quiero correr de este paseo
Y despues, lo quiero entrar
No quiero correr de este paseo

// One To Remember //

Ooh, one to remember

So we won't forget

Say to remind me

So we won't forget

Ooh, one to remember
One to remember

Say to remind me

So we won't forget

So we won't forget

// Dearest Alfred //

Where are you now?
We hardly see or speak anymore
Your letter is the best gift

I am happy, happy when you're here
Tell me about your friends
Write to me soon

Your letter is the best gift
Your letter is the best gift

Can you imagine my joy?
I received your wonderful letter

Your letter is the best gift
Your letter is the best gift

I love my joy very much
I've received another chance in earnest

Your letter is the best gift
I am so glad that you are here

Your letter is the best gift
Your letter is the best gift
Your letter is the best gift
Your letter is the best gift

// So We Won't Forget //

Ooh, one to remember
Writing it down now
So we won't forget

Ooh, never enough paper
Never enough letters
So we won't forget

Call me, what you want?
Call me, what you need?
Words don't have to say
Keep it to myself

Ooh, every minute
Every hour
So we won't forget

You don't have to be silent
Say to remind me
So we won't forget
Ooh

Call me, what you want?
Call me, what you need?
Words don't have to say
Keep it to myself
Call me, what you want?
Call me, what you need?
Words don't have to say
Keep it to myself

Ooh, one to remember
Writing it down now
So we won't forget

Ooh, never enough paper
Never enough letters
So we won't forget

Ooh, every minute
Every hour
So we won't forget

You don't have to be silent
Say to remind me
So we won't forget
Ooh

Ooh, one to remember
Writing it down now
So we won't forget

Ooh, never enough paper
Never enough letters
So we won't forget

Ooh, every minute
Every hour
So we won't forget

You don't have to be silent
Say to remind me
So we won't forget

Ooh, say you remember
For I think I've lost it
