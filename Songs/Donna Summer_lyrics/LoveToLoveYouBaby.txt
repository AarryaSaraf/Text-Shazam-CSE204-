Album: LoveToLoveYouBaby

// Full Of Emptiness //

Full of emptiness
Broken promises
And love turned out so sad
The hurt goes on and on

Full of emptiness
Hello loneliness
Good friends will mind
The sands of time
Have slipped through my hands

From the bottom to the top
Why he had me feeling fine
Then I took a long long drop
When he walked out of my life
My world

Full of emptiness
That and something less
And memories of him
Have never seemed to be

// Need-A-Man Blues //

Another Monday morning
Another five day week ahead
Such a lonely weekend
Sleeping in a half filled bed

Got those need-a-man blues
I need a man so bad
Got those need-a-man blues
And it's driving me mad

All the evening people
Dressing up just to get undressed
And me I'm stuck at home
Losing more and gaining less

Got those need-a-man blues
I need a man so bad
Got those need-a-man blues
And it's driving me mad

Emptiness inside
Empty as a glass in my hand
Whisky friend of mine
Help me make it easy without

Got those need-a-man blues
I need a man so bad
Got those need-a-man blues
And it's driving me mad

Baby baby baby
Goes the singer on my hi-fi
Honey honey honey
My reply

Got those need-a-man blues
I need a man so bad
Got those need-a-man blues
And it's driving me mad

Emptiness inside
Empty as a glass in my hand
Whisky friend of mine
Help me make it easy without

Got those need-a-man blues
I need a man so bad
Got those need-a-man blues
And it's driving me mad

Another Monday morning
Another five day week ahead
Such a lonely weekend
Sleeping in a half filled bed

Got those need-a-man blues
I need a man so bad
Got those need-a-man blues
And it's driving me mad

// Whispering Waves //

By the shore of the sea searching for his memory
Sifting sand through my hand weighing what he means to me
In the early morning haze seagulls seem to cry my pain
And ocean feels it too sighs his name on whispering waves

Wrote his name next to mine big and deep there in the sand
Till the earth tends to flow and our names will be drowned
All the birds sing harmonies to the top line of the breeze
While the ocean breathes his name on whispering waves

There's a bistro where we would dine each evening
Candle light and California wine
Love is holding hands across the table
I still go past each night
Look for his car outside

At the foot of this cliff we spent days weaving our dreams
Making plans building homes raising kids and coloring scenes
Then one morning he was gone and our story reached an end
But his words still linger on on whispering waves

Aah, ahh, ahh...

By the shore of the sea searching for his memory
Sifting sand through my hand weighing what he means to me
All the birds sing harmonies to the top line of the breeze
While the ocean breathes his name on whispering waves

// Pandora's Box //

If I had known of what would come
I might have walked outta here a lot less harmed
But I'm no lady of the glass
And I can't foretell what will pass

And I went with my defenses down
As your love sent me spinning spinning 'round
Oh you took me to the very top
And then I took a bad (and) long long drop

Oh promises are made to be broken
That's all I ever learned from loving you
And oh when you opened up your love to me
You opened up Pandora's box

Oh promises are made to bend and stretch oh
And end up being really worthless
And oh when I opened up the door to you
I opened up Pandora's box

Just one look and I knew you knew
I was all hung up hung up on loving you
I just put all my trust in love
And I placed a big old bet on lady love
I was sentenced to loving you
And I'm serving time in solitude
Yeah I gave ya everything that I got
And you took it all and walked right off

Oh promises are made to be broken
That's all I ever learned from loving you
And oh when you opened up your love to me
You opened up Pandora's box

Oh promises are made to bend and stretch oh
And end up being really worthless
And oh when I opened up the door to you
I opened up Pandora's box

Just one look and I knew you knew
I was all hung up hung up on loving you
I just put all my trust in love
And I placed a big old bet on lady love

Oh promises are made to be broken
That's all I ever learned from loving you
And oh when you opened up your love to me
You opened up Pandora's box

Oh promises are made to bend and stretch oh
And end up being really worthless
And oh when I opened up the door to you
I opened up Pandora's box

Oh promises are made to be broken
That's all I ever learned from loving you
And oh when you opened up your love to me
You opened up Pandora's box

Oh promises are made to bend and stretch oh
And en up being really worthless

// Full Of Emptiness (Reprise) //

From the bottom to the top
Why, he had me feeling fine
Then I took a long, long drop
When he walked out of my life
My world

Full of emptiness
That and something less
Bad memories of him
Have never seemed to be
