// Hot Stuff //

Sittin' here eatin' my heart out waitin'
Waitin' for some lover to call
Dialed about a thousand numbers lately
Almost rang the phone off the wall

Gotta have some hot stuff
Gotta have some love tonight

Lookin' for a lover who needs another
Don't want another night on my own
Wanna share my love with a warm blooded lover
Wanna bring a wild man back home

Gotta have some hot love baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff baby tonight
I want some hot stuff baby this evenin'
Gotta have some lovin'
Gotta have love tonight

// Bad Girls //

Bad girls
Talking about the sad girls
Sad girls
Talking about bad girls, yeah

See them out on the street at night, walkin'
Picking up on all kinds of strangers
If the price is right
You can't score if you're pocket's tight
But you want a good time
You ask yourself who they are
Like everybody else
They come from near and far
Bad girls, yeah

Bad girls
Talking about the sad girls, yeah
Sad girls
Talking about bad girls, yeah

Friday night and the strip is hot
Sun's gone down and they're out to trot
Spirit's high and legs look hot
Do you wanna get down
Now don't you ask yourself who they are
Like everybody else, they wanna be a star

Bad girl
Sad girl, you're such a naughty bad girl
Beep-Beep, uh-uh
You bad girl you sad girl
Your such a dirty bad girl
Beep-Beep, uh-uh

Now you and me we're both the same
But you call yourself by different names
Now your mama won't like it when she finds out
That her girl is out at night

Hey, Mister, have you got a dime
Mister, do you want to spent some time
Oh, yeah
I got what you want, you got what I need
I'll be your baby, come and spend it on me
Hey, Mister
I'll spend some time with you

// Love Will Always Find You //

Love will always find you
No matter where you hide
Love is gonna find you
And it's only just a matter of time

Love's our common hero
It always gets its man
Cause love is so much stronger
Don't you know it will win in the end
Love will always find you

Love will always find you
No matter where you are
Love is gonna reach you
Cause it's never really that far

No, no man is a island
We weren't born to be alone
Life is made for sharing
And love is gonna find you home

I spent my time waiting
I lost my faith in love
Just as I was hurting
Well then you just turned up

So never give up hoping
You can't see you around the bend
Well you be sure of one thing
Love's waiting at the end

Love will always find you
No matter where you hide, yeah now
Love is gonna find you
It's only just a matter of time

Love's our common hero
It always gets its man
Love is so much stronger
Don't you know it will win in the end

Love will always find you
No matter where you hide, oh yeah
Love is gonna find you
It's only just a matter of time

Love's our common hero
It always gets its man
Love is so much stronger
It's only just a matter of time

// Walk Away //

Just another emotion
Is this something more
If it's only a passionate phase
I'd rather just close the door

Turn away, turn away, turn away
Walk away, walk away, walk away

Walk away
When you know that I need you
Walk away
When you hear me call you
(don't) walk away
Don't you see that I want you
Here by my side

(Don't) walk away
When you know that I need you
(don't) walk away
When you see me coming
(don't) walk away
When you know that I need you
By my side

I'm sure that I'll get over you
It'll take me a while you see
Next time, there won't be no next time
Save all my feelings for me

Turn away, turn away, turn away
Walk away, walk away, walk away

Walk away
When you see that I need you
Walk away
When your hear me call you
(don't) walk away
Don't you know that I need you
Here by my side

(Don't) walk away
When you see that I need you
(don't) walk away
When you hear me call you
(don't) walk away
Don't you know that I want you
By my side

Turn away, turn away, turn away
Walk away, walk away, walk away

Walk away
When you know that I need you
Walk away
When you hear me call you
(don't) walk away
When you know that I need you
Here by my side

(Don't) walk away...

// Dim All The Lights //

Dim all the lights sweet darling
Cause tonight it's all the way
Turn up the old victrola
Gonna dance the night away

Love just don't come easy
No it seldom does
When you find the perfect love
Let it fill you up

Dim all the lights sweet darling
Cause tonight it's all the way, hey baby
Turn up the old victrola
Gonna dance the night away

Love just don't come easy
No it seldom does
When you find the perfect love
Let it fill you up

Dim all the light sweet honey
Cause tonight it's you and me
No need to worry darlin'
Cause it's for eternity

Love don't come easy
This you know I understand
I want to be your woman
If you'll be my man
Let yourself go freely and I'll
Show you things that you've dreamed of
Don't think that your dreaming
We've found the perfect love
And I'm like a cup come fill me up

Dim all the lights sweet darlin'
Cause the night is on the way, oh baby
Turn up the old victrola
Gonna dance the night away

Do what you want
You can use me all you want
Take me bottom to top
Don't leave anything undone

No, no, no do it tonight
You know the moments are right
Turn my brown body white
Come let's dim all the lights

Dim all the lights sweet darlin'
Cause the night is on the way, hey baby
Turn up the old victrola
Gonna dance the night away, hey baby
Dim all the lights sweet darlin'
Dim all the lights sweet honey...

// One Night In A Lifetime //

There's more to question than answers
And sand will slip through your hands
And love is faster than lightning
So grab it while you can mm, mm, mm...

Well I've been searching forever
Between the bad and the good
But now I know what I'm missing
And I wanna make it with you

One night in a lifetime
One life in a night
One night in a lifetime
And babe it's gotta be tonight
Babe it's gotta be tonight

One night in a lifetime
One life in a night
One night in a lifetime
And baby it should be tonight
Baby it should be tonight

One night in a lifetime
One night, one night, one night
In a lifetime, one night

They say that love is a gamble
And luck will play a trick or two
But I'll risk all of my loving
I'd put my last buck on you

One night in a lifetime
One life in a night
One night in a lifetime
And baby it's gotta be tonight
Baby it's gotta be tonight

One night in a lifetime
One life in a night
One night in a lifetime
And baby it's gotta be tonight
Baby it's gotta be tonight

One night in a lifetime
One night, one night, one night
In a lifetime, one night

One night in a lifetime
One life in a night
One night in a lifetime
And baby it's gotta be tonight
Baby it's gotta be tonight

One night in a lifetime
One life in a night
One night in a lifetime
And baby it should be tonight
Baby it should be tonight

// Can't Get To Sleep At Night //

Can't get to sleep at night

Can't get sleep tonight, no matter how I try
Can't get you off of my mind, can't get to sleep tonight

Spoke to you today, called on the telephone
You sounded very far away
Baby I love you, I still love you

Can't get to sleep tonight, no matter what I do
Just can't get you off of my mind, stuck on you,
Stuck like glue

We both live separately, I've found somebody new
And he's real, real good to me, but baby, I love you
I still love you

Can't get to sleep at night

Don't want to believe that it's over
I keep telling myself one more time
So I lie awake with a heartache
You're always on my mind
Haunting my memory
Think about you all the time

Can't get to sleep tonight, no matter how I try
Just can't get you off of my mind, stuck to you

Spoke to you today, called you on the telephone
You sounded very far away
But I love you, I still love

Can't get to sleep tonight, no matter what I do, what I do
Just can't get you off of my mind

Can't get to sleep tonight, no matter how I try
Just can't get you off of my mind...

Can't get to sleep tonight, just can't get you off of my mind

// On My Honor //

Here I am on my own again
The days rush by
The nights all seems so slow
Guess I've let you down
In my way, some how
If you take me back
I know we'll make it
We'll make a promise
And then break it

On my honor I will try
Always do the best I can
Though the tears
May fall like drops
From my eyes honey
On my honor I will try

If you want me to be strong
I'll give it everything I have
You'll never have to worry
Cause we're not in a hurry
On my honor I will try

It's a lover's dance
In a fiery chant
Don't be afraid to face the music now
It's a gambler's chance
Not a lost romance
And I'm not you
And you're not me and
Sometimes we feel differently

On my honor I will try
Always do the best I can
Though the tears
May fall like drops
From my eyes honey
On my honor I will try
If you want me to be strong
I'll give it everything I have
You'll never have to worry
Cause we're not in a hurry
On my honor I will try
I will try
I will try
I'll try

// There Will Always Be A You //

Like the stars that shine above
In a warn and wind tossed love
Just like tears that fall forever

Like the raven and the dove
Looking for a perfect love
After rainy, stormy weather
I am yours and you are mine
Till the stars fall from my eyes
There will always be a you

A ship sailing without end
A lost, tired, worm down friend
And old broken run down shoe
I keep running back for more,
At least you thought I would be sure
But I gave up, I broke it's true
Still there will always be a you

Don't ask me how
I tried so long
And in my heart I know
I will never go away
If you wanted me to stay
Well in a million years
I wouldn't go

Cause I love you so
Yes I do
I love you so
I could never leave you
I love you
Don't go away
Don't go away
There will always be a you

A ship sailing without end
A lost tired, worm down friend
And old broken run down shore
I keep running back for more
At least you thought I would be sure
But I give up, I broke it's true
Still there will always be a you

I am yours and you are mine
Till the stars fall from my eyes
There will always be a you

I will never go away
If you wanted me to stay
Well in a million years
I wouldn't go
Cause I love you so
Yes I do
I love you so
I could never leave you
I love you
I love you
Don't go away
Can't go away
There will always be a you

At night I cry
Can't find a reason
I'm left alone
Can't seem to understand
At night I cry
Can't find a reason
I'm left alone
Can't seem to understand
There will always be a you
There will always be a you
[Fade]

// Our Love //

Dropping you this line to give you peace,
And to set your weary mind at ease
I know that it's rough when you're so far away
Listen to the words I have to say

Sometimes when you're gone, I don't know why
I find the simple need to sit and cry
It's not that I'm lonely or, that I'm blue
It's just that I need to be with you

Our love will last forever
Our love will last forever
Our love will last forever
Our love will last forever

When I know our love is going strong
And I have all I need to carry on
And my mind and body seem to understand
That for me you are the perfect man

Our love, our love, our love
Will last forever
Our love will last forever

Our love will last forever
Our love will last forever
Our love will last forever
Our love will last forever
Our love will last forever
Our love will last forever

// Lucky //

Scared and lonely
Going out for the night
Shakin' all over
And wishing I'd never
Come here

He pulled up in a cloud of smoke
So much was said
But nobody spoke a word

So I took a chance
And he followed me home
I knew he wouldn't beg
So I gave in without fighting

Been so long since I've been this way
Since I loved this way
So I asked him if he would stay for a while

Lucky comes easy
Lucky's not shy
And if you're lucky
You'll go for a ride
For a ride

We talked a while
And he told me nice
We laughed and we cried and
I knew that I could love him
He got up to say goodbye
I said where you going,
He said that he must leave

Lucky comes easy
Lucky's not shy
And if you're lucky
You'll go for a ride
For a ride

Lucky comes easy
Lucky's not shy
And if you're lucky
You'll go for a ride
For a ride

Lucky takes you out for a ride
For a ride
Lucky takes you out for a ride
For a ride

Lucky comes easy
Lucky's not shy
And if you're lucky
You'll go for a ride

Lucky come easy
Lucky's not shy
And if you're lucky
You'll go for a ride
For a ride

// Sunset People //

Late night flight, L.A.X.,
Limousine and you're all set
For sunset, for sunset

Riot house a penthouse suite
The street's alive below your feet
On sunset, on sunset

Rainbow girl, whiskey man
Spotting every star they can
On sunset, on sunset

Rock an' roll every night
Underneath them neon signs
On sunset, on sunset

Sunset people, doin' it right - night after night
Sunset people, night after night - doin' it right
Sunset people, doin' it right - night after night
Sunset people, doin' it right - night after night
Holdin' on to the last breath of life
On sunset, on sunset

Smooth haired guys thumbing rides
Linin' up from side to side
On sunset, on sunset

In between pretty girls
Still sixteen but know the world
On sunset, on sunset

Foreign cars full of stars
Tinted glass to hide the scars
From sunset, from sunset

Billboard signs on the strip
Glamorize the latest hits
On sunset, on sunset

Sunset people, doin' it right - night after night
Sunset people, night after night  - doin' it right
Sunset people, doin' it right - night after night
Sunset people, doin' it right - night after night
Holdin' on to the last breath of life
On sunset, on sunset

Friday night  the weekend crowd
Moves on in to get on down
On sunset, on sunset

Life is hot  life is fast
People try to make it last
On sunset, on sunset

Sunset people, doin' it right - night after night
Sunset people, night after night - doin' it right
Sunset people, doin' it right - night after night
Sunset people, night after night - doin' it right
Sunset people, doin' it right - night after night
Sunset people, night after night - doin' it right
Sunset people, doin' it right - night after night
