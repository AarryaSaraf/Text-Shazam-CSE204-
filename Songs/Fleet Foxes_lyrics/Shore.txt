Album: Shore

// Wading In Waist-High Water //

Summer all over
Blame it on timing
Weakening August water
Loose-eyed in morning
Sunlight covered over
Wading in sight of fire

And we're finally aligning
More than maybe I can choose

Soon as I knew you
All so wide open
Wading inside of fire
As if I just saw you
Cross Second Avenue
Wading in waist-high water

And I love you so violent
More than maybe I can do

Now we're finally aligning
More than maybe I can choose

// Sunblind //

For Richard Swift
For John and Bill
For every gift lifted far before its will
Judee and Smith
For Berman too
I've met the myth hanging heavy over you
I loved you long
You rose to go
Beneath you, songs, perfect angels in the snow
So time to stage
Forget reserve
The type of great coronation you deserve

I'm going out for a weekend
I'm gonna borrow a Martin or Gibson
With Either/Or and The Hex for my Bookends
Carrying every text that you've given

I'm gonna swim for a week in
Warm American Water with dear friends
Swimming high on a lea in an eden
Running all of the leads you've been leaving

I'm overmatched (for Arthur Russell)
I'm half as wise (Duncan and Curtis)
If this is flat, brother I apologize (Jimi and David, for Nick and Otis)
No one alone (For Bell and Buckley)
Can leave the cave (Marvin and Adam)
And all you've loaned won't be kept inside a grave (for Arthur Russell, for Arthur Russell)

I'm gonna swim for a week in
Warm American Water with dear friends
Just intending that I would delight them
Swimming high on a lea in an eden

So I dream
So I dream

I'm gonna swim for a week in
Warm American Water with dear friends
Swimming high on a lea in an eden
Running all of the leads you've been leaving
And in your rarified air I feel sunblind
I'm looking up at you there high in my mind
Only way that I made it for a long time
But I'm loud and alive, singing you all night

Warm American Water

// Can I Believe You //

Can I believe you?
Can I believe you?
Can I
Ever know your mind?
Am I handing you mine?
Do we both confide?

I see it eat through every word I sow
See what you need to, do you doubt it's yours
Now I'm learning the ropes
Never get this close
I've been wounded before
Hasn't let me go

It never got less strange, showing anyone just a bare face
If I don't, well, nothing will change
Staying under my weather all day

Can I believe you when you say I'm good?
I didn't need to when I wished you would
No it isn't enough
Never held that much
Now another way up
Been a row too rough

It never got less strange, showing anyone just a bare face
If I don't, well, nothing will change
Staying under my weather all day

Lately I'm wondering too
What type of desire I can break
When I'm one way with them, one with you
What half is it of me rearranged?

Can I believe you?
Can I believe you?
I want to need you
I want to need you
Can I believe you?
Can I believe you?

// Jara //

First sight of the first good morning since you've been out of town
First time any violet omens don't shadow me around
So you want part of the great white tyrant, of ghost after ghost?
Well you won't stop and I know you'll find it, halfway down the coast

You were never afraid of fighting, you blame an angry god
And when you see the first sign of violence, you bear it all as hard
When you held her son and wept I just felt jealous most of all
The best I had was near as bad as the sign of the rising fall

Though we're only alive a short while
So many beneath my feet
All weather, you walk with me
And you were off on a wandering mile
I was holding a weak excuse
I was heavy beneath blue

Now you're off to Victor on his ladder to the sky
And I'm left to sing it with you from my piece of the waterside
And you sang for the lost and gone who were young, and deserving more
And now I'm stood upright all night ready when you come in the door

Though we're only alive a short while
So many beneath my feet
All weather, you walk with me
And you were off on a wandering mile
I was holding a weak excuse
I was heavy beneath blue

All I heard
Wait for the word
You're coming with me

// Featherweight //

All this time I've been hanging on
To an edge I caught when we both were young
That the world I won wasn't near enough
Always distant, always all

In all that war, I'd forgotten how
Many men might die for what I'd renounced
I was staging life as a battleground
No I let that grasping fall

May the last long year be forgiven
All that war left within it
I couldn't, though I'm beginning to

And we've only made it together
Feel some change in the weather
I couldn't, though I'm beginning to

And though it's all so uncertain, cold
All the rafters cracked, all the copper sold
There's a ration back in a manifold
If you need it or forgot

May the last long year be forgiven
All that war left within it
I couldn't, though I'm beginning to

And we've only made it together
Feel some change in the weather
I couldn't, though I'm beginning to

And somehow I see
It's free

And with love and hate in the balance
One last way past the malice
One warm day's all I really need

And with love and hate in the balance
One last way past the malice
One warm day is all I really need

// A Long Way Past The Past //

More than I had in mind
More than I wish I knew
And now it's near on me
Some rush of red fear
And my worst old times look fine from here

I know you walked this route
And you might help me out
You said what's done is done
I can't turn the hand 'round
But still it looks a long way down

Oh man, was it that much better then?
We were left alone, we were proud of our pain
And so I want to walk out in the night
See the wide young river flood rain

We're not on one straight line
I made my own way through
And when the track goes cold
I'll know that it's true
That rebirth won't work like it used to

Oh man, was it that much better then?
We were left alone, we were proud of our pain
And so I want to walk out in the night
See the wide young river flood rain

And I can't let go
Of a lot I've left
I'm holding nothing
But what I kept
And it all got dimmer
Each passing step
And I need you with me
And you read the writ
Are you now insisting
Is it not worth it?
But I've got no option
I inherited this and I'm overcome

That's that, we're a long way from the past
I'll be better off in a year or in two

// For A Week Or Two //

Some lost coast
Some bright days
No face on your young head
Piece of wheat
In your teeth
Carrying water, pears, and bread

And you're close to some surrender
You can feel it at your feet
And later on remember
When the fever broke and you could eat

And you've brought enough to last another week or two
Know the door is open know that I miss

You sought land
Overgrown
No words, no false, no true
Water stands
Waves just pass through it
Like something moves through you

// Maestranza //

Monday night
Loud in the road outside
I saw the gate coming down
And smoke all around
The south hill

These last days
Con-men controlled my fate
No one is holding the whip
And the oil won't stick
But I will

Now that a light is on
Now that the water runs
And the heartless are nearly gone
No time to get it wrong

Sunday end
Ache for the sight of friends
Though I've been safe in the thought
That the line we walk
Is the same one

Now that a light is on
Now that the water runs
And the heartless are nearly gone
No time to get it wrong

Sometimes it comes to this, no it's true
This time, what comes of it, call it due
I do
I do
I do
I do

Now that a light is on
Now that the water runs
And the heartless are nearly gone
No time to get it wrong

// Young Man's Game //

New day rising, come close the blue blinds
I'll be lying in my ocean of time

I could dress as Arthur Lee
Scrape my shoes the right way
Maybe read Ulysses
But it's a young man's game

Dying fire, so tired of this place
Not inspired, can't keep to this pace

I could worry through each night
Find something unique to say
I could pass as erudite
But it's a young man's game

You should know
You're my last hope

I've been solving for the meaning of life
No one tried before and likely I'm right

Not too straight or too clean
Like your borrowed blue bike
I've been a rolling antique
For all my life

You should know
You're my last hope

I've been lucky as sin
Not one thing in my way
Just the arena I was in
But it's a young man's game

// I'm Not My Season //

Blood of my blood
Skin of my skin
You're in roundelay water again
I want to face the condition you're in
The old wrenches hardly turn me

Can you catch a thrown line
Tied around neat
Circle once about, please allow me
I see the pall coming off of our cheeks
We're weak but a leaf is turning

And I move lightly in the dawn
Try to, lightly ever on the lee

Though I liked summer light on you
If we ride a winter-long wind
Well time's not what I belong to
And I'm not the season I'm in

Holding on close
Holding on to
Any kind of ring I can bring you
And at the beachwood pyre good news
It's wet but it's catching easy

And I move slightly in the dawn
Try to, gently ever on the lee

Though I liked summer light on you
If we ride a winter-long wind
Well time's not what I belong to
And you're not the season you're in

// Quiet Air / Gioia //

Quiet air, quiet in blue
Quiet ice-melt, summer-red cedar
Quiet air might terrify you
Quiet now though soon enough louder
Some shape, float on faith, in the eye

You want to go where the fire is worst
You want to watch our tower drop to the water
I know you don't want anyone else hurt
I know you don't you're better you're stronger
Some shape, float on faith in the eye
Some shape, floating in the eye

I'll be alone in the corduroy heath
I'll wait a long time till the hard rain is over
You're alone and you're calling on me
I'm underneath my canopy colder
Some shape, float on faith in the eye
Some shape, floating in the eye

Feeling a gold unfolding hand on me
Nowhere to go, no one I'd rather see (oh devil walk by)
Oh devil walk by (I never want to die)
Oh devil walk by (I never want to die)
Feeling a gold unfolding hand on me (wrong hour, wrong time)
Oh devil walk by (I never want to die)
Feeling a gold unfolding hand on me (wrong hour, wrong time)
Nowhere to go

// Going-to-the-Sun Road //

Due west at a blind day's end, flying pavement underfoot
Some horizon eyeing me up, often does right at dusk
Often known it wore that look

And I've known it one too many times
And the thought of flight for water whiter
Now those passing dotted lines
Going on and on just shake my sleep all night
Could be I'm finally losing my fight

Due south all the fog aired out, no idea where all this leads
Though I still wanted to show Going-to-the-Sun Road to you
Still got one in me

If I want to, I'll arrive at peace
I know I decide what I remember
If this ever mended me
All the on and on
Just shakes my sleep all night
Now I'm losing my fight

A estrada do sol
O comeÃ§o de tudo
E as nuvens que agora se afastam
Mostrando um caminho que estÃ¡ sempre lÃ¡

E que Ã© qualquer lado que a gente quiser caminhar

// Thymia //

Pair of tin cups rolling in the backseat
Rustle like a mallet on a downbeat
Rain will make rust, water on the concrete

Have a true love, more than just an outline
Solid shape of, known it for a long time
Never failed us, even losing daylight

Thymia accompany us
All the way to Townsend

How to explain, moving as a phantom?
Falling like rain, over and abandoned

Thymia accompany us
All the way to Townsend

// Cradling Mother, Cradling Woman //

I'll run down
Lay my weight where it lies
I'll come round
Out in sheltering sky
Seek you out
Like I wanted it when
It was eighty-eight out
And the apricot flowers were coming in

And I feel worn, but the air is clean
And my clothes are torn, but it's right on me
Passing rain, blue white heat
Agony, not to me, it's not defeat

No one here
Say we waited our while
Good idea
Crowding out of those aisles
Nowhere near
Where I thought we would be
But one and the same
The drought and the rain to me

And I've been a while gone
But the air is clean
And I had it all wrong
But I made my peace
Passing thought, empty street
Agony, not to me, it's not defeat

I've been bright, I've been faded
I'm nearly halfway through
Barely believe we made it
When I met eyes with you
I caught a walking fever
I know how all this ends
Palm over my receiver
Cradling me again

// Shore //

Kin of my kin
I rely on you
Taking me in
When a wave runs me through
As a shore I ever seem to sail to
And I know old heavinesses shake you

Maybe I stayed
Little long, could be
I needed shade
Sand on my feet
And it's some new ailment is in me
Can't divide what's memory and what's dream

Afraid of the empty
But too safe on the shore
And 'fore I forget me
I want to record

While I see it all
While I see it all

I remember walking shoulders hours speaking
I remember meeting Clementine and weeping
I remember Prine I remember you
After word of Berman I remember Pfeiffer burning
I remember hoping I'd remember nothing
Now I only hope I'm holding onto something

Now the quarter moon is out
Now the quarter moon is out
