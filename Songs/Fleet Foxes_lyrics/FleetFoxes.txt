// Sun It Rises //

Red squirrel in the morning
Red squirrel in the evening
Red squirrel in the morning
I'm coming to take you home

The sun rises
Over my head
In the morning
When I rise

Hold me dear
Into the night
Sun, it will rise
Soon enough

The sun rising
Dangling there
Golden and fair
In the sky

// White Winter Hymnal //

I was following the
I was following the
I was following the
I was following the
I was following the
I was following the
I was following the
I was following the

I was following the pack, all swallowed in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads from falling in the snow, and I turned 'round and there you go
And, Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow red as strawberries in the summertime

I was following the pack, all swallowed in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads from falling in the snow, and I turned 'round and there you go
And, Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow red as strawberries in the summertime

I was following the pack, all swallowed in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads from falling in the snow, and I turned 'round and there you go
And, Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow red as strawberries in summertime

// Ragged Wood //

Come down from the mountain, you have been gone too long
The spring is upon us, follow my ornate song
Settle down with me by the fire of my yearning
You should come back home, back on your own now

The world is alive now, in and outside our home
You run through the forest settled before the sun
Darling, I can barely remember you beside me
You should come back home, back on your own now
You should come back home, back on your own now

In the evening light, when the woman of the woods came by
To give to you the word of the old man
In the morning tide, when the sparrow and the seagull fly
And Jonathan and Evelyn get tired

Lie to me if you will
At the top of Barringer Hill
Tell me anything you want, any old lie will do
Call me back to, back to you

Lie to me if you will
At the top of Barringer Hill
Tell me anything you want, any old lie will do
Call me back to, back to you

// Tiger Mountain Peasant Song //

Wanderers this morning came by
Where did they go, graceful in the morning light?
To banner fair
To follow you softly in the cold mountain air

Through the forest, down to your grave
Where the birds wait and the tall grasses wave
They do not know you anymore
More, more, more

Dear shadow, alive and well
How can the body die?
You tell me everything
Anything true

Into town, one morning I went
Staggering through premonitions of my death
I don't see
Anybody that dear to me

Dear shadow, alive and well
How can the body die?
You tell me everything
Anything true

Jessie, I don't know what I have done
I'm turning myself into a demon
I don't know what I have done
I'm turning myself to a demon

// Quiet Houses //

Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down

Darkening
Darkening
Darkening
Darkening

Darkening
Darkening
Darkening
Darkening

Come to me
Come to me
Come to me
Come to me

Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down

Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down

// He Doesn't Know Why //

Penniless and tired with your hair grown long
I was looking at you there and your face looked wrong
Memory is a fickle siren song
I didn't understand

In the gentle light as the morning nears 
You don't say a single word of the last two years 
Where you were or when you reached the frontier 
I didn't understand, no

See your rugged hands and a silver knife
Twenty dollars in your hand that you hold so tight
All the evidence of your vacant life
My brother, you were gone

And you will try to do what you did before
Pull the wool over your eyes for a week or more
Let your family take you back to your
Original mind

There's nothing I can do
There's nothing I can do

There's nothing I can say
There's nothing I can say
I can say

// Your Protector //

She left a week to roam
Your protector's coming home
Keep your secrets with you, girl
Safe from the outside world

You walk along the stream
Your head caught in a waking dream
Your protector's coming home
Coming home

As you lay to die beside me, baby
On the morning that you came
Would you wait for me?
The other one would wait for me

As you lay to die beside me, baby
On the morning that you came
Would you wait for me?
The other one would wait for me

You run with the devil
You run with the devil

Tell your brother to be good
Tell your sister not to go
Tell your mother not to wait
Tell your father I was good

As you lay to die beside me, baby
On the morning that you came
Would you wait for me?
The other one would wait for me

// Meadowlarks //

Meadowlark, fly your way down
I hold a cornucopia and a golden crown
For you to wear upon your fleecy down
My meadowlark, sing to me

Hummingbird, just let me dive
Inside the broken ovals of your olive eyes
I do believe you gave it your best try
My hummingbird, sing to me

My hummingbird, sing to me

Don't believe a word that I haven't heard
Little children laughing at the boys and girls
The meadowlark singing to you each and every day
The arc light on the hillside and the market in the hay

// Blue Ridge Mountains //

Lie down with me, my dear
Lie down
Under stormy night, tell nobody

My brother, where do you intend to go tonight?
I heard that you missed your connecting flight
To the Blue Ridge Mountains, over near Tennessee

You're ever welcome with me anytime you like
Let's drive to the countryside, leave behind some green-eyed look-alikes
So no one gets worried, no
So no one gets worried, no

But, Sean, don't get careless
I'm sure it'll be fine
I love you, I love you
Oh, brother of mine

In the quivering forest
Where the shivering dog rests
Our good grandfather
Built a wooden nest

And the river got frozen
And the home got snowed in
And a yellow moon glowed bright
Till the morning light

Terrible, am I, child?
Even if you don't mind

In the quivering forest
Where the shivering dog rests
Our good grandfather
Built a wooden nest

And the river got frozen
And the home got snowed in
And a yellow moon glowed bright
Till the morning light

Terrible, am I, child?
Even if you don't mind
No

// Oliver James //

On the way to your brother's house in the valley deep
By the river bridge, a cradle floating beside me
In the whitest water on the bank against the stone
You will lift his body from the shore and bring him home

Oliver James washed in the rain
No longer
Oliver James washed in the rain
No longer

On the kitchen table that your grandfather did make
You, in your delicate way, will slowly clean his face
And you will remember when you rehearsed the actions of
An innocent and anxious mother full of anxious love

Oliver James washed in the rain
No longer
Oliver James washed in the rain
No longer

Walk with me down ruby beach
And through the valley floor
Love for the one you know more
Love for the one you know more

Back we go to your brother's house, emptier my dear
The sound of ancient voices ringing soft upon your ear

Oliver James washed in the rain
No longer
Oliver James washed in the rain
No longer
