// She Got Dressed //

He's made of sand
Not flesh and not bone
He's as good as the seeds he's sown
But he loves you so
Like no one else you know could do
Put your wedding dress on

On the tip of my tongue
As the back beat cracks
I hit my drum
I get into the car
My interrogation starts
In the passenger seat
There's a ton of mess of tangled leads
And a golden ring
Glimmerin' at her feet

And the beat it goes on

She got she
Got dressed got
She got dressed up
[X2]

And the beat it goes on

Is he quick on his feet?
Does he ever look past you on the street?
Is he ever on time
When he's getting home at night?
In the opposite side
Every argument keepin' every night
Is it what you accept?
Is there anything that's left?

And the beat it goes on

She got she
Got dressed got
She got dressed up

And the beat it goes on

She got she
Got dressed got
She got dressed up

Beat will go on
Yeah the beat will go
For the king in the pot
Yeah the beat will go on
[X2]

Beat will go on
Over land over still
Out of the garden and over the hill
[X2]

// In The Hot Hot Rays //

Heat, like a dead weight
Still coverin' the street outside
So heavy that the dogs can't hide
In the hot, hot rays

Out on the sidewalk
It's a river where the children go
Out enjoying the arctic show
In the hot, hot rays
In the hot, hot rays

In the hot rays I get old

I could never know what the dead man sees
I could never know what the deaf man hears
Or know what the dead man fears
Even if you were incomplete

Brother let it go
And I'll find my way
If you want to know Indian summer
I will make it back here to you somehow
What have you ever thought
Underneath the fire

I try to play god
Do my best to keep the heat at bay
Maybe that would make you want to stay
In the hot, hot rays
In the hot, hot rays
In the hot, hot rays

// Anyone Who's Anyone //

Charlie never had to get too hot
Just try sticking with the girl you got
Other women they would seem secure
They're just as fragile as her

I heard Sanders in a new good space
She found Johnny in the strangest place
At the back of the hotel downtown
Blood on the side of his mouth

Is there anything that I can do
All my sympathy it went to you
I heard you were looking so strung out
Smiling and tumbling down

The seasons will change
The things you perceive
The company will keep disturbing your sleep

It's so much better in the sunlight
I'm just a little mirage
It's so much better in the sunlight
I'm just a little mirage
It's so much better in the sunlight
I'm just a little mirage
It's so much better in the sunlight
I'm just a little mirage

Oh, oh

// Textbook Love //

I was in the classroom after school
Working on the chalkboard once again
You were in your uniform standing by the door 
When I saw you, saw you there

You were wondering if I'd walk you home 
Even though I lived on the opposite side
I said, "Sure, I don't need to be home soon anyway, anyway."

Textbook love 
Textbook love
Hold my little hand, baby

I started to wear my dad's cologne
Started combing my hair to the side
Anything that I could do 
Just to keep your attention on me

But I was just a phantom passing by
When you where on the track home with your friends
I was nobody at all
I just needed an answer, baby

Textbook love 
Textbook love
Hold my little hand, baby

Textbook love,
You were the girl I was dreaming of
Hold my little hand, baby

Never will I know what you saw in me
But surely you knew exactly what I saw in you
Thinking back now, I'm sure that was the only attraction, baby

Textbook love in the textbook style
Textbook girl with the textbook smile
Textbook love, when I was on my way to redemption, baby

Textbook love
Textbook love
Hold my little hand, baby

Text book love
You were the girl I was dreaming of
Hold my little hand, baby

Lord, it's a shame, I know
Thinking of how it could go
Hold my little hand, baby

Lord, it's a shame, I know,
Thinking of how it could go
Hold my little hand, baby

// So Long To The Head Strong //

This morning I received air mail letter 3 from my connection overseas.
I pulled the paper back,
you begin your attack and it means:

Of all the places I laid down my head,
I think of two I regret
Love isnât easy my baby youâre sayin' today

But tell Mr. shoemaker Iâll be away
On a rocket or a comet or the dock of the bay
On a continental steam ship sailin' away
On a one way ticket on a 1st class airplane
I wanna know what youâre thinkin' about
Donât just let me go

Four hundred days have passed since Iâve heard from you last
Iâm getting worried, I admit
Maybe itâs nothing much
Thereâs nicer shores in sight
Oh I just donât know

Of all the places I laid down my head I think of two I regret
Love isnât easy my baby weâd tell you today
But tell Mr. shoemaker Iâll be away
On a rocket or a comet or the dock of the bay
On a continental steam ship sailin' away
On a one way ticket on a 1st class airplane
I wanna know what youâre thinkin' about
Donât just let me go

Iâm sayin' so long
I want my baby back
I know itâs hard to see
Why sheâs in love with me
Iâm sayin' so long
I want my baby back
I know itâs hard to see
Why sheâs in love with me
So long to the headstrong
I wasnât qualified to lead that city life
Thatâs all I have to say

// Icicle Tusk //

I'll shoot you dead
For the father
Of the coal miner's daughter
Beneath the icicle tusk
You and me among the flattering dusk

In my haste I draw my weapon
Designing your final lesson
As you recede to the floor
All is silent but the fluttering door

Twenty-five grand on the table
Of the high wall street stable
I'm not responsible for
The reputation of the
Neighborhood whore

But I'm a keyhole peeker
And you're my surveilance keeper
And though my memory rusts
I will always see the icicle tusk

And I must admit
That it gets lonesome on my shelf
This much I can tell
This much I can tell
