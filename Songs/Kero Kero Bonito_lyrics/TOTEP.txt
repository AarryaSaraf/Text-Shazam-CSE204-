Album: TOTEP

// The One True Path //

I don't always stay right on the track
But somehow I know that I'll come back
See, I haven't lost sight before

Through words, words I cannot scream
Than along a glistening stream
'Til I find the open sea
Lying right there for me

Well, I'm not the only person looking for a clue
I see by the footprints in the sand that you are too
So maybe together we can find a path that's really true

[?]

And civilization marches on
Occasionally prone to get it wrong
Though it might seem we're lost
We never sit down too long

And off in the distance you see me
Just know this is how it's meant to be
Now I have got this far
I believe in the one true path

// You Know How It Is //

Oh, you know how it is
When you try, but nothing's going right
Oh, you know how it is
When you say you're doing fine

Now every day is just the same as all the ones before
You love your friends, but you don't even see them anymore

And I kinda feel like
Something is changing forever
But I can't figure out the reason why

Oh, you know how it is
When you try, but nothing's going right
Oh, you know how it is
When you say you're doing fine

Oh, you know how it is
When the sky is crashing down again
So there you laugh, but you really want to cry
'Til the tears run dry

You walk the park in silence, 'cause the kids have gone away
And maybe this is me
But the planes all seem to fly so low these days

And I kinda feel like
Something is changing forever
I can't be certain but I think you know

Oh, you know how it is
When you try, but nothing's going right
Oh, you know how it is
When you say you're doing fine

Oh, I know you do
'Cause I sure know it too

// Cinema //

There's no one around
But the two old-timers who visit when they're in town
The credits are rolling as they walk out

I get to my screen
With the phantom audience sat there waiting for me
But they don't complain where I take a seat
It seems

Even now, I still stop by
Most stories look better wide
And I feel at peace here, 'cause

While the adverts might've changed
The popcorn tastes the same
And in the end the day's always saved
So once the picture stops
I let the hours pass, distracted in the dark

Even now, I still stop by
Most stories look better wide
And I feel at peace here, until

The lights come up bright
When it's over
I step outside and I think I might get
Some dinner somewhere nice
Tonight
