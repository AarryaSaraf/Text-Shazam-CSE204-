Album: TimenPlace

// Only Acting //

When I step onto the stage, see the curtain raise
I'm apparent, I've got someone to play
All the crowd, they're in the seats
Looking straight at me for an answer
They just get what they see
They applaud and the usher's locking the door till the matinee

So I get to know the cast, though it doesn't last
I'm a pro but I won't take it too far
Now I know I shouldn't get comfy on the set
Every time it all comes down when we end
That's the truth that the stage school doesn't teach you
But it's good to know

It takes much more than just learning the script
You see, you gotta take the part and believe it
Oh, I sometimes make up all of my lines on the spot
But I will always give what I got

I thought I was only acting
But I felt exactly like it was all for real
I sure didn't know it hurt so bad
That no rehearsal could show you how to feel inside
What you gotta hide
Where to put your pride
When to realize you've had your time
Find another role
Carry on the show

You should be able to feel a performance with your whole body and soul
Now I'm gonna teach you everything I
And you, and you, and you, and you

Oh, I sometimes make up all of my lines on the spot
But I will always give what I got

I thought I was only acting
But I felt exactly like it was all for real
I sure didn't know it hurt so bad
That no rehearsal could show you how to feel inside
What you gotta hide
Where to put your pride
When to realize you've had your time
Find another role
Carry on the show

I thought I was only acting
But I felt exactl... exactl... exactl... exactl... exac...
What you gotta hi...

How to feel inside
What you gotta hide
Find another role

// Outside //

I think I smell the rain again
I see the leaves getting dewy
They're breathing

Fresh air awakens everything
While the winds are barging through
They greet you

Outside here
Like any other morning
Landing on cue

I hear the drizzle coming down
And then I realize in all of my life
I don't think that I remember it
Being so vivid

One, two, three, four
Five, six miles away
I wonder if they notice over there?

Until the light throws colors across the vista
Piling so high they reach out of sight
To heaven

// Time Today //

I got so much time today
I got hopes and dreams and plans all yet to be made
So look out the way
'Cos I'm coming through now
I got something to do
And I'll try
As I might
To keep up with the light
'Til I'm into bed for the night

I got so much more to say
I got books and tapes and canvas bearing the weight
But they're not arranged
'Cos it takes too long and
I'm still moving on
But I don't
Even know
Where I should be trying to go
So I guess I'll follow my nose

And I can't help but think about
If the sun ever stays down
Will I notice or will I
Just be sitting around
Ticking a list off
Rueing what I said wrong
But dawn still greets my windowpanes
And as long as I shall
Wake up in the morning
I got plans

I got so much time today
I got so much time today
I got so much time today
I got so much time

// Flyway //

A flock across my window
Gone when I look around
Until the sun gets longer
They're getting out of town
Where on earth in the world
Do they go?
Do their feathers freeze stiff
In the snow?
How should I know?

But I can bet you they'll come
Back to the same old tree
Since I was crawling they've been
Watching over me
In the gardens
That ripple in the water
Climbing higher up
Where nobody sees
Look at the sky and spot the green

And I heard that they weren't
Meant to stay
Anywhere the air chokes
Or they get
On the flyway

So ride the rising currents
I trust that I will see you again
When I pick up the courage
I hope that I can join you someday

// Dump //

Show the man a pass
Everything you've got
Put it where he points and
Throw it all on top
Hear the crunching beneath the junk let go
A parrot cage and dial phones

Blue for small electrics, microwaves in here
Television pieces in a rusty skip
But be careful if you brought chemicals
They've got a place especially for those

And there's always a busy crowd around
People come from all over town (over town)
Dropping off the things that they no longer need to keep

Everybody's collage stacking up the wall
When the sun is out, the scent gets pretty tall
But the site operators don't care much
They're looking forward to their lunch

And when we fill it up
A lorry comes and drags it on the tarmac
Somewhere far from here
So when they let us in at 6 A.M
The spaces are empty again

And there's always a busy crowd around
People come from all over town (over town)
Dropping off the things that they no longer need to keep

// Make Believe //

I set a watch for 5 o'clock
I think of trees and rivers as I'm drifting off
I pinch my wrist (just to tell where I am)
I get a twinge (seems as real as it can)
But I remain and so I know the rest is up to me

At night, the sunlight beats upon my skin
In here, I see everything
And until the morning comes
I feel it

All my life I tried
To find the time to make believe
But now as certain as the seasons
I know real life will get in between
If I never get to decide my reality
At least I see how it could be
When I get round to sleeping (sleeping), dreaming (dreaming)
Works for me

And though my soul (let's me do what I want)
Is pretty bold (in a place I belong)
From time to time, my grip'll slip
And I just lose control
Then awake I freeze
But nothing in my head can hurt me
However real it seems

All my life I tried
To find the time to make believe
But now as certain as the seasons
I know real life will get in between
If I never get to decide my reality
At least I see how it could be
When I get round to sleeping (sleeping), dreaming (dreaming)
When I get round to sleeping (sleeping), dreaming (dreaming)
Oh

// Dear Future Self //

Dear future self, it's me again
The girl you buried way back when
I see you gave into curiosity
My life right now is going well
I've time to spare as one can tell
But you might just sense some trepidation too

No one knows where they really want to go
Why we always stay inside
And now it snows
But I bet you miss it all
So

Do cars ever fly?
Have you travelled time?
Or is it just the same old thing for you and I?
I used to be fine because you always seemed so far away
But now I feel our paths getting closer each day

You'll find enclosed, a passport photograph
The headlines and a railcard
It's funny how physical us humans are
Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh

But I heard all the years'll leave you hurt
Everyone you love disappears and nothing works
Please don't say you hate the world
I hope that I won't

Do cars ever fly?
Have you travelled time?
Or is it just the same old thing for you and I?
I used to be fine because you always seemed so far away
But now I feel our paths getting closer each day
It's rather strange

// Visiting Hours //

Hi it's me, how are you?
Is the food okay?
Did you order the usual or something else?
I remember you said you were after yogurt
So I bought two

Let's draw the curtains back to bring in the light
Press the buttons so that you're sitting right
All the people that I spoke to said
They think you're doing great

Back home, they're all asking
They wanna come and see you real soon
We're already missing you
But please
Take the time you need

Ooh-ooh-ooh

I've been thinking about you coming home
I was asking them when but they don't know
We can order a taxi on the day
All the way

Is that the time?
I should let you go to bed
Brush your teeth, take it easy, get some rest
I'll be back here again tomorrow morning
I'll see you then
Night, night

// If I'd Known //

Looking back, I ponder all the possibilities
That I had sat right in front of me
Every one an optional decision
Giving birth to a dedicated universe

Only if I'd known long ago
That a choice will grow
Into another road

But I heard that every single version of events
Will occur whatever we expect
And as such, I really needn't worry very much
'Cause I feel all worlds at once

Only if I'd known long ago
Space is ours to roam
If you can find your own

Reality proves me
It goes pretty smoothly
But I haven't found the meaning
Quite yet

Only if I'd known long ago
That a choice will grow
Into another road
Only if I'd known long ago
Space is ours to roam
If you can find your own

Who tore the sky? Who copied me?
Water going back on itself, up to the sea
Is that, a whole world talking from just behind a ceiling?
Watch me get my two timelines
Not going through the door all alone
I leave something on the side
So you know I said hello

// Sometimes //

1, 2
1, 2, 3

Sometimes, life gets you down
But you can turn it all around
The raindrops keep falling, you're soaking to the bone
And you can't see for the clouds

Sometimes, life isn't fair
But you can beat it, don't despair
You win some, you lose some
And then you lose some more
You even played your best, but just round the corner
The sun's looking dapper
And Lady Luck's his date
The happy days are coming again

Sometimes, life is a drag
But get that chin up, don't be sad
'Cause somebody up there is looking out for you
And now they're makin' plans

But just round the corner
Well, the real truth of it's that nobody really knows
Life sure doesn't make sense
But on your boots you can bet
That everybody gets the blues sometimes

// Swimming //

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I was treading on the beach
Summer underneath my feet
Somewhere I'd never seen
Mama led me by the hand
'Til the grit stuck with the damp
And the foam fizzed adrift
When we both strode in

I can feel the detritus lifting
And it moves like I knew that I was free again
And without thinking I ventured out

Swimming
Across the sea
The current battles way down below me
Drifting
But holding on
I keep my head up to watch the shore

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

After many years had passed
Hoping I would find the path
I arrived at the start
In the shadow of a cliff
Memories floating in the wind
I squared up to the tide
On my own this time

I can feel the detritus lifting
While a teardrop tickled as it ran away
But it got lost in the wash I tossed

Swimming
Across the sea
I get the feeling
I always have been

Swimming
Across the sea
The current battles way down below me
Drifting
But holding on
I keep my head up to watch the shore

Swimming
Swimming

// Rest Stop //

Over the sunset
At the edge of the atlas
I'm driving alone
When I see in the distance
A light in the dark
And when I approach it
A note on the glass
We're serving

Inside it's quiet
But the tables are shining
In blue chrome and white
With a fan on above but
No service in sight
I pick out a booth
Sliding in from the side
And then I start feeling quite tired

So I know
That I'll be here a little while
When I go
I'll get right back on the road

Let everybody come together
The world at peace as one
We could live a dream forever
It's really up to us
And if you're not sure how to start
Then open up your heart
Let the feeling grow
And soon you're sure to know

Light up light up
The whole night sky with all your love
Just say the prayer
We'll make it there
If we work hard enough
Keep on keep on
And give it everything you've got
'Cos only then
We'll reach the end
The land where we belong

So when we walk among the clouds
Hold your neighbour close
As the trumpets echo round
You don't wanna be...
