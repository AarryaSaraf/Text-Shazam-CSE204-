// Intro Bonito //

The perfect moment in history

Hey, you, take your headphones off
Toss your phone cause the beat is on
Dancing's better when you're with someone
But I guess you wouldn't know it if you're home alone
Kero Kero Bonito in the place
Bonito on the mic, Kero's on the bass
Hitting you with the international æ¥½ãã sound
That will make the world get down

From the countryside to the concrete ghetto

// My Party //

Everyone can come
By the way, you're invited
You seem pretty fun

Biggest in the world
DJ spins all the tunes

But if it's your birthday you're still welcome to come 'round

My party
My party's on
My party's on

You don't have to bring extra food
I've got it all laid out
Cake and jelly and ice cream
Enough for everyone
No matter what you're into
Or what you look like
Even if you don't know us
You're gonna have a good time

I don't need a reason to get down
But if you're getting married you're still welcome to come 'round

// Cat vs Dog //

Dog v. cat
You're canine trash
There's nothing I like more than a mutt getting whacked
With my baseball bat, how'd you like that?
That'll stop you barking, startling me in the morning
What's your problem, dog?
Cat got your tongue in the vice 'til the blood comes?
Hope your owner comes running cause he's lonesome
Bark any louder, I'll kill him for fun

Cat v. dog
It's all kicking off
I wanna murder moggies all around the world
I'll bite you in the head, 'til you're dead
Brains everywhere, but I won't care
I'll be hanging with my bitches enjoying the riches
Of a multi-sensory life
Man's best friend is a dog, not a feline
Homosapiens got one thing right

Eternal hatred

// Let's Go To The Forest //

Hey, let's all go into the forest
Nobody will notice for a while
There we can visit all the creatures
Maybe they can teach us facts of life

Or we can travel to the ocean
Don't forget your lotion
It's quite hot
I once met seven lovely crabs
They said I should go back and join them for tea

Oh wait, the forest got demolished
When they built the airport years ago
But we can still go see the ocean
Cause they put it in a bowl at the mall

// Small Town //

Small town, what to get around
Everybody's safe and sound
'Cause the action's happening somewhere else
There are a few shops
One that sells lots
Special supermarket deals
Can be quite fun
If there's nothing else to do

And I would like to fly away
Around here everybody knows my name (You're Sarah)
And they all think I am so strange
Because I don't look quite the same

The bus doesn't come much
Never on holidays
And the station's several miles out
So we all stay in drinking cups of tea
Watching T.V. until it's lights out

And I would like to fly away
Around here everybody knows my name
And they all think I am so strange
Because I don't look quite the same

// I'd Rather Sleep //

I feel so funny these days
I'd rather sleep than stay awake
Trees used to talk to me
Now I know what's real and what is fake
Now I know what's real, what's fake
Rather sleep than stay awake

Are we from outer space?
This doesn't feel like the right place
And we'll try anything
Just to be a kid once again
Just to be a kid again

Now I know what's real, what's fake
Rather sleep than stay awake
Just to be a kid again
