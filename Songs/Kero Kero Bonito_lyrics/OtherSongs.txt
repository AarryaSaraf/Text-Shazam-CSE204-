// Astronomy For Two //

I take this route at night
Cause at certain times
It's exposed in the moonlight
But my ring is sublime
I'm taken by surprise
By some acquaintance of mine

Pretending to remember
Though secretly I know
We did business a long time ago
We trade pleasantries even though

I don't mean a thing to you
I see the way you move
(The way you move)
Cause I move like that too
When I'm confused
Your stories don't mean shit to me
I'm sorry that sounds crude
(That sounds crude)
But I could tell the truth
Now that would be rude

So it's up and up and up
And it guilts me
So with the chance to part
We turn our heels and walk
In different directions
And as our footsteps fade
I'm stricken by the thought
''We're just the same, oh god''

All of the floor with our knee above
You're moving fast but your mind is slow
Bouncing it down through the streets at night
Fixing all that the high was rolled back
The sun's gone and it ain't coming back
The city life got a music track

And sometimes I remember why it was
We did business a long time ago
I'd love to stay in touch even though

I don't mean a thing to you
I see the way you move
(The way you move)
Cause I move like that too
When I'm confused
Your stories don't mean shit to me
I'm sorry that sounds crude
(That sounds crude)
But I could tell the truth
Now that would be rude
Oh oh oh

Now that would be rude
Oh oh oh
Now that would be rude
Oh oh oh
Now that would be rude
Oh oh oh oh oh
Now that would be rude

Oh, this is the way I cry alone
Oh oh

// Build It Up //

If you like to go places (Okay!)
Pick your favorite and build it up
As big as you want it
Don't forget to put your own flag on top
And when it gets boring
It's more fun to go knock it down
But then you got nothing
And it's time to turn your life around

This house is pink in the front
Flowers in the back (Connecting blocks!)
I'll change your hair if I want
Even if it's a hat
You see the frog in the stairs
He's made out of bricks (The bricks are green!)
And I can make a nice bridge as well

Taimumachin te, let's go!
Nanamane mai Nippon, yeah
Dorai monga oshaiete kureta
Dare mo ira kera ii jan
So build it up, build it up
Bokutachi no yuutata yo
Mai tachi mai tachi mai tachi te
Yuu kara dame nanda

If you like to go places
Pick your favorite and build it up
As big as you want it
Don't forget to put your own flag on top
And when it gets boring
It's more fun to go knock it down
But then you got nothing
And it's time to turn your life around

I built a town over there
They are holding flags (With both their hands!)
And there's a solar device
Coming out of a bench
But there's a problem I have
I can't build a car (Why can't you build?)
Cause all my tires are on the boat

Airport
A cathedral
And a theme park
And a sweater from your grandma
Karaoke
And a sauce pan
As in Newton's laws of motion
Independence
Have a biscuit
Always put your best foot forward
Why are we all here

Bang!
Tokuhatsu te thatâs okay nanamane
Kyoryu wa namane
So knock it down, knock it down
Onokaku head on back to the future
Letâs make this super duper dinosaur
Nyo ki o tsukero
Help me to decide where to build it up

If you like to go places
Pick your favorite and build it up!
As big as you want it
Don't forget to put your own flag on top!
And when it gets boring
It's more fun to go knock it down
But then you got nothing
And it's time to turn your life

If you like to go places
Pick your favorite and build it up!
As big as you want it
Don't forget to put your own flag on top!
And when it gets boring
It's more fun to go knock it down
But then you got nothing, then you got nothing
Then you got nothing, then you got nothing
Then you got nothing, then you got nothing
Then you got nothing, then you got nothing
Then you got nothing, then you got nothing
Hey!
If you like to go places
Pick your favorite and build it up!
As big as you want it
Don't forget to put your own flag on top!
And when it gets boring
It's more fun to go knock it down
But then you got nothing
And it's time to turn your life around

That stanazolol hit gets addictive

Up, down, left, right, up, down, turn around
Drink up, sweat slow, bend low, there you go
Up, down, left, right, up, down, turn around
Drink up, sweat slow, bend low, there you go

I've been pumping my mass full of plastic

Hop, skip, slip, wet, fall down, reset
Step up two, three, step down into me
Hop, skip, slip, wet, fall down, reset
Step up two, three, step down into me

Always take a deep breath then it's in you

These mutated new roosters are looking tremendously buff with the muscle we love

Up, down, left, right, up, down, turn around
Drink up, sweat slow, bend low, there you go
Up, down, left, right, up, down, turn around
Drink up, sweat slow, bend low, there you go

Hop, slip, wet, fall down, reset
Up two, three, step down into me
Skip, slip, wet, fall down, reset
Step up two, three, step down into me

These mutated new roosters are looking tremendously buff with the muscle we love

I'm a chicken, I'm a chicken
I'm a chicken, I'm a chicken, chicken
I'm a chicken, I'm a chicken
I'm a chicken, I'm a chicken, chicken
I'm a chicken, I'm a chicken
I'm a chicken, I'm a chicken, chicken
I'm a chicken, I'm a chicken

Always take a deep breath then it's in you

// Fortune Teller //

I came here
In control of my life
'Cause I thought
Everything was alright

Oh you talk (no)
We talk without action baby
Though you said you liked my watch
Just before asking what my star sign was
Then I heard you later say
That those who use horoscopes
Should get a therapist around
Do they wear your glasses
With those
Feathers hanging down

Now I'm no economist but I could tell you
Something's wrong with this trade off
But likewise I don't know
What I'm talking about
No I don't

A single teardrop
Falls from my eye
But I'm kind of hoping
That we are not pretending
Anymore

The badges have been traded
So I guess its time to go
And yet we take the same route
What a wonderful coincidence
Though you don't hear me complaining
In fact I'm happy
To be a contact on your phone
I guess that's some kind of action
I hope you rescue me quite soon

I came here
In control of my life
'Cause I thought
Everything was alright
But it's not

A single teardrop
Falls from my eye
But I'm kind of hoping
That we are not pretending
Anymore
And what do you say to that
I'm not sure what she meant with that touch
But then I think about these things too much
So maybe love is not the answer

// It's Bugsnax! //

Kinda bug and kinda snack
Try to catch 'em in your trap
Feed somebody and you'll see
We are whatever we eat
Find 'em hiding in the sand
Tearing up a ketchup patch
Come to Snaktooth Island and
Discover its Bugsnax

I heard that somewhere far off in the ocean
There lies an island where the creatures roam
A famed explorer tells me they're delicious and yet
They're hitherto unknown

You might think it sounds impossible
'Til you've seen a carrot crawl

Kinda bug and kinda snack
Try to catch 'em in your trap
Feed somebody and you'll see
We are whatever we eat
Find 'em hiding in the sand
Tearing up a ketchup patch
Come to Snaktooth Island and
Discover its Bugsnax

Oh-oo-oh
It's Bugsnax

Oh-oo-oh
Talkin' 'bout Bugsnax

Oh-oo-oh
It's Bugsnax

And if the rumour's not complete baloney
Then it's the story of the century
So grab a journal listen up and make some new friends
To solve the mystery

An expedition thirteen-strong
Of Grumpuses who all set off
Seeking out a better life
On Snaktooth Island they did find
A tasty quest to fill the hole
That many feel inside their soul
Venture deep to reach the truth
And maybe you'll learn something too

You might think it sounds impossible
'Til you've seen a sandwich climb a wall

Kinda bug and kinda snack
Try to catch 'em in your trap
Feed somebody and you'll see
We are whatever we eat
Find 'em hiding in the sand
Tearing up a ketchup patch
Come to Snaktooth Island and
Discover its Bugsnax

Oh-oo-oh
It's Bugsnax

Oh-oo-oh
Talkin' 'bout Bugsnax

Oh-oo-oh
It's Bugsnax

Oh-oo-oh
Everyone's talkin' 'bout Bugsnax

It's Bugsnax

// Rock 'n' Roll Star //

I live my life in the city
There's no easy way out
The day's moving just too fast for me
I need some time in the sunshine
I gotta slow it right down
The day's moving just too fast for me

I live my life for the stars that shine
People say, "It's just a waste of time"
Then they said, "I should feed my head"
That to me was just a day in bed
I'll take my car and drive real far
They're not concerned about the way we are
In my mind my dreams are real
Now you concerned about the way I feel

Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star

I live my life in the city
There's no easy way out
The day's moving just too fast for me
I need some time in the sunshine
I gotta slow it right down
The day's moving just too fast for me

I live my life for the stars that shine
People say, "It's just a waste of time"
Then they said, "I should feed my head"
That to me was just a day in bed
I'll take my car and drive real far
They're not concerned about the way we are
In my mind my dreams are real
Now you concerned about the way I feel

Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star

You're not down with who I am
Look at you now
You're all in my hands tonight

Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star
Tonight I'm a rock 'n' roll star

It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll
It's just rock 'n' roll

// rom com 2021 //

You used to see
Lovers embracing making tracks in the snow
Contrarily
All of my winter strolls are taken alone

What does it say about me?
That I'd rather die in your arms than
Watch you move on without me
Being the one in your heart
And what would you think

If I wanted to be yours like no one else before
I need you to see
That you make me crazy like no one else could be
And baby I'm yours
If you're crazy for me

A country escape
Fine young things
Isolophobia
Two-timed
I don't wanna know
Well actually I do
Soul reawakening
Love is all we have

If I wanted to be yours like no one else before
I need you to see
That you make me crazy like no one else could be
And baby I'm yours
If you're crazy for me
If I wanted to be yours like no one else before
I need you to see
That you make me crazy like no one else could be
And baby I'm yours

If you're crazy for me

// The Open Road //

We came to a halt in the snow
Swerving on the wet slush below
Just as well we did 'cause
That lorry in front of us
Was gonna tip over

So we peeled off for a break
Though we knew it meant we'd be late
But we were alive and
It felt pretty good to taste
The strawberry milkshake

And still we carried on
Our entire lives upon
The open road
Guided on the asphalt by
The traffic lines and burger signs
'Til we're in the motel gone for the night

Way out on the north golden coast
Just as we were ready to go
Bandits broke into the van
And took all we had
In the city we were stranded

And still we
Somehow rolled through
Onto the next town
Always somewhere new

I've seen mountains pierce the sky
Deserts frosted under ice
But some days I just miss mum and dad
Though I think it makes them happy
I finally managed to see
The open road

'Til I'll make quite sure there's nowhere
Left to get to know

The open road
The open road
Will take me home someday

// The Sneaker Dance //

Do the sneaker dance
Show the whole world your swag
Our shoes like exercise
Even when they look nice
Do the sneaker dance
Dance as hard as you can
A true blue sneaker fan
Ain't scared of no scratch

If you go down to the shops
Then you might bump into
A squirrel, a dog and a croc
It's the famous Benchmates
The dog's called Lakeith
The nervy blue fella with the braced up teeth
When he sees a nice shoe
There's a routine that he has to do
He stomp stomp stomps
His feet
He doesn't hold back he ignores the beat
Then he jump jump jumps really high
Letting his laces fly

Do the sneaker dance
Show the whole world your swag
Our shoes like exercise
Even when they look nice
Do the sneaker dance
Dance as hard as you can
A true blue sneaker fan
Ain't scared of no scratch

No scratch
'Cos scratches build up character

Ms Crocodile sticks with her kid
She believes in attachment parenting
Her shoes are way too big
But she pads them out so they fit
Mr Squirrel has no such issue
His look mirrors his ambition
With a scarf of finest wool
'Cos he's always feeling cool
But he harbours a curious secret
He's followed by a spirit creature
That only he can hear
Whose words echo in his ears

Do the sneaker dance
Show the whole world your swag
Our shoes like exercise
Even when they look nice
Do the sneaker dance
Dance as hard as you can
A true blue sneaker fan
Ain't scared of no scratch

So stomp stomp stomp
Your feet
Don't hold back just ignore the beat
Jump jump jump
Really high
Letting those laces fly
Stomp stomp stomp
Your feet
Don't hold back just ignore the beat
Jump jump jump
Really high
Letting those laces fly

Do the sneaker dance
Dance as hard as you can

// Why Aren't You Dancing? //

I see you, you only hear me
But you know we're the same after all
We face monotony
We feel the need to belong, so baby
Why aren't you dancing with someone?
All you know is all you see
At midnight you see everything
Simply release your mind
Seek some what kind find you
Ready to keep on dancing through the night?
We all need to shake this hatred
I get up when I'm feeling down
Some stay against the wall
Trying to retain their cool
They ask me, why are you dancing with such force?
(Oooh oooh yeaah yeaaah)
(Oooh oooh yeaah yeaaah)
Sun rises as we predicted
DJ Gus with a tear in his eye
I feel I've lost something stepping outside
And I wonder, why aren't you dancing anymore?
