// Waking Up //

What's that?
Wanna go back to sleep...

When I hear that alarm clock ring (wake up!)
That's my cue to enter
I've finished counting my 40 winks (all done!)
And then I remember
There's so much stuff to do
Right now I just wanna snooze because
Waking up is the hardest part (uh-huh)
But then, it's essential

Get up, get up! What's that in the sky?
Could it be? It's KKB!

Back in the place, I'm looking great
Bet you can't tell I'm half awake
Living my way, no day is the same
But sometimes I'm a bit late

When I hear that alarm clock ring (wake up!)
That's my cue to enter
I've finished counting my 40 winks (all done!)
And then I remember
There's so much stuff to do
Right now I just wanna snooze because
Waking up is the hardest part (uh-huh)
But then, it's essential

3, 2, 1, lift-off, infinity
Let's go on a Kero Kero journey
Get on the bus and hold on tight

But then I wonder, is it all a dream?

Whoaaaaaa

// Heard A Song //

I just put the radio on
Heard a song, I can't stop thinking about it
Though it didn't last very long
It's in my head
Plus I didn't catch who it was
But it sort of sounded like a big hit
Are you gonna play it some more?
Guess I'll keep on listening

Cruising along in my new car
Top down, round the block, not too fast
All I need is bass on the stereo
So I turn it up and it goes like
"Oh-oh-oh-oh," it's a beat so sweet
That I stop in the middle of the street
Then a kid runs up and he says
"I don't know you but that sounds fresh"

When I need a hand, no matter where I am
I pick up the vibrations
Where the music plays, all the time every day
Now I'm stuck on rotation

I just put the radio on
Heard a song, I can't stop thinking about it
Though it didn't last very long
It's in my head
Plus I didn't catch who it was
But it sort of sounded like a big hit
Are you gonna play it some more?
Guess I'll keep on listening

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I think it went something kind of like
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I think it went something kind of like this

I get back to my dominion
And ask my friends their opinion
I heard this song on the radio
(Sounds cool, Sarah, how did it go?)
Like "oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh?"
(I don't know)
Hm, well, if nobody can help me
Did I imagine this melody?

When I need a hand, no matter where I am
I pick up the vibrations
Where the music plays, all the time every day
Now I'm stuck on rotation

I just put the radio on
Heard a song, I can't stop thinking about it
Though it didn't last very long
It's in my head
Plus I didn't catch who it was
But it sort of sounded like a big hit
Are you gonna play it some more?
Guess I'll keep on listening

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I think it went something kind of like
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I think it went something kind of like this
I think it went something kind of like this
I think it went something kind of like

// Graduation //

Today's my graduation, I've done my dissertation
Even got a hat I can throw
Today's my graduation, so long to education
Didn't learn a thing anyway

These are the best days of our lives
That's what the grown ups told us, right?
Tapping my pencil, waiting for the bell
Thinking what to say in my last farewell
Hey teacher, leave those kids alone
ãããã®ã¿ã¤ã ããªã¦ãã
And everyone's happy, but è¡ããããªã

// Fish Bowl //

Small fish stuck in a fish bowl
Do you pine for the sea?
Watching life all around you
Are you looking at me?

Swim around in a circle
Come along when it's feeding time
You're the king of the castle
Who likes to hide (whoa-oh)
But when you find the ocean
How will you know where to go?

Oohhhhh ooh ooh, oh
Oooh-oooh oooh ooh oh oh [x2]
Yeah...

å°ããå ´æã ãã©

When I see you tomorrow
Will you remember this song?

Oohhhhh ooh ooh, oh

And it's true
I was kind of lonely at first
So I took life in my own hands
Got a haircut, joined a band
And it turned out alright

I hit the street
Feeling good to be me
Get the look, paint the town
I pick the spot I wanna get down
Some days are tough
When you gotta keep up
But it's all worth the rush
Cause we stick around anyway

So I took life in my own hands
Saw a movie, joined a band
And it turned out alright

I hit the street
Feeling good to be me
Get the look, paint the town

Some days are tough

But it's all worth the rush

// Break //

I know it seems kinda tough
But really it's easy enough
For us to slow down the pace
So we can all go take a break
In fact, thereâs not much better than nothing at all

Yo, Gus and Jamie, it's Sarah
Just to let you know that I don't wanna do anything today
So I'll see you later, bye!

// Lipslap //

ããã!

Thumb and forefinger tap, laughter
Yeah, you know it
A fingertip placed on the lips which gave a little (shh!)
Maybe we'll talk about that, not now
You see I'm jackin'
All my friends are here, there's just
No time for taboo
Can't believe I have to rap on tracks so you get it
Wanna talk about so much stuff then you just give me hush
We can sort that out for now, the place is packing
Spent the cash on a new dance floor
And everyone's come through

It's all lipslap
Thinking caps
Just lipslap
That is that

I can't hear you cause this beat is taking over
I'm not one to lip-read and you don't come with subtitles
You sure talk the walk into your walkie-talkie
But you can't keep a secret and you never get a word in (Uhh?)
Why don't you keep me in the loop, I like it posted
You stay here and watch an old brick wall get freshly painted
If you didn't catch the facts, I'll repeat them
But to be as smart as me you have to know the slang
Yeah

It's all lipslap
Thinking caps
Just lipslap
That is that

I'll put string through a tin can
Tied up to a goldfish tank
Watch them pass 'round a whisper
Take turns seeing where it lands

It's all lipslap (Get down!)
Thinking caps (What?)
Just lipslap (Be proud!)
That is that
It's all lipslap
Thinking caps
Just lipslap (Yeah)
That is that

I'll put string through a tin can
Tied up to a goldfish tank
Watch them pass 'round a whisper

// Trampoline //

As the rain came down my window
I heard the wind blow all around
I was stuck under the weather
Felt like forever out of the sun
But then I looked at my garden
And saw at the bottom my old trampoline
That's when I knew what to do
I could break right on through
Yeah, the clouds aren't so high

First you fall down, then you jump back up again
Find your rhythm, momentum is the key
It's so easy, anyone can trampoline
So jump on up and you can see
The whole wide world
When you're ready, mix it up, try everything
Full twist, backflip, just set your body free
Life looks better when you're on your trampoline
But keep an eye on gravity and don't forget to bounce
(Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce...)

Though I love it when I'm floating
It's kind of lonely at the top
But if we all jump together
Then we'll go higher
We'll never stop
I know I've got to come down
Put my feet on the ground soon
But that's okay
You see, I'm safe in the knowledge
No matter what, I got my old trampoline

First you fall down, then you jump back up again
Find your rhythm, momentum is the key
It's so easy, anyone can trampoline
So jump on up and you can see
The whole wide world
When you're ready, mix it up, try everything
Full twist, backflip, just set your body free
Life looks better when you're on your trampoline
But keep an eye on gravity and don't forget to bounce
(Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce...)

// Hey Parents //

No matter what you do, there's something everyone shares
We all inherit ourselves from a pair
And if you never met them all, you call them your friends
One thing is certain, the tree never ends

And though it's been a while since I first saw them
I still say

Hey, mom, how are you today?
Are you missing me a lot?
Yes, I'm sticking to my bedtime
And I'm keeping very warm, so
Hey, dad, don't you worry now
Cause I got it all worked out
But don't tell me "did you keep my room?"
Cause I'm coming over soon

I sure don't know if making me was part of the plan
But that's what happened, and I'm cool with that
But now I'm here, I better go find something to do
Something I want to, so they can relax

Cause I got it all worked out
