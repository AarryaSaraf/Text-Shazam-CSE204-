// Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas //

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yule-tide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away

Here we are, as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years, we all will be together if the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Here we are, as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore

Through the years, we all will be together if the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

// Let It Snow //

Hey James. Oh hey Kacey. How ya doin'?
I'm good, but have you seen the weather outside?
It's snowing really hard, I wonder if it's gonna stop
I'll tell you one thing
As long as we're both nice and warm inside
It can snow out there as much as it likes
That's really true
It's really true
It's so true
It's so true
So true

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Oh my gosh
Sorry
Yeah, no, yeah
Should we-
No, let's just-
Okay
We'll-
Okay

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

I don't believe it! Oh my God, do you want me to help you?
No, I'm fine
Okay
Oh, I'm so s-, I gotta get that fixed. Is this, is this, you really do
I need to call the handyman. Do you know what? Maybe we should just, we'll um, you know, we'll, we'll move-
Let's move away, this way. We should go, we should go over here
Yeah, okay, um. Okay, you ready?
Okay
Okay

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh my God!
Go away, no you-
This your house?
Yes it is, yes, awkward. Get a refund! I'm so sorry, um- Okay, okay, yeah. Wow, what's, that's crazy, okay
Okay, let's just move away from the-
Okay, you ready?
Yeah
Okay, it's snow so it'll dissolve in your mouth. I got a, I got some, it's in there
It's okay?
It's okay
Good, 'cause here we go

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbye-ing
(But) As long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow

My God, oh
You okay? You, are you okay?
I'm fine, are you good?
Yeah
You okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, let's-
Let's pick it up again and we'll carry on
Okay

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm (Crazy storm)
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Okay, okay
Yes
Alright
Okay

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it
Snow
Oh, come on!

Alright, thank you for being very nice, stand by

// Christmas Makes Me Cry //

It feels like we're supposed to be happy during the holidays
But, sometimes they just make you really sad
So, I wrote this song for anybody that might be feeling a little bit lonely

It's all red and gold and Nat King Cole and tinsel on the tree
It's all twinkle lights and snowy nights and the kids still believe

And I know that they say, "Have a happy holiday"
And every year, I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry

It's the ones we miss, no one to kiss under the mistletoe
Another year gone by, just one more that I, I couldn't make it home

And I know that they say, "Have a happy holiday"
And every year, I swear, I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry
Always

It seems like everybody else is having fun
I wonder if I'm the only one
Who's broken heart still has broken parts just wrapped in pretty paper
And it's always sad seeing mom and dad getting a little grayer

And they always say, "Have a happy holiday"
And every year, I swear, I sincerely try
Oh, but Christmas, it always makes me cry
Always

// Present Without A Bow //

Leon Bridges! (Yo)
Come on in (Good to see you, good to see you)
Hey! Thanks for coming
Thanks for having me (Okay)
Honestly, I have nothing ready for Christmas
I didn't know you were coming
Hey, don't sweat it, I'm just here to sing a song

We've been moving too fast and we should slow down
Come and sit by the fire, stop rushing around
'Cause this time of year, it's meant for two
So don't leave me lonely if I don't have you

The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

Hoo hoo

Before we know, the wreath will come down
The halls won't be decked, there'll be no snow on the ground
The new year will come and bring lots of change, baby
And if I'm not with you, girl, sippin' on champagne

The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
And Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

Mmm, mmm
Mmm, hmm

The holiday's just another day that's cold
Standing all alone under the mistletoe
I don't feel the cheer, ooh, without you here
There's no red and white stripes on a candy cane
And Silent Night just wouldn't sound the same
Where'd the magic go?
All I know is me without you is like a present without a bow

Hmm
Me without you is like a present without a bow, girl, yeah
Come sit by the fire (Yeah, yeah)

// Mele Kalikimaka //

// Ribbons And Bows //

One, two, three, four
Hey, everybody
Thank you so much for watching the show
This has been so much fun
Have a wonderful new year, happy holidays

Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love

Don't get me wrong, a shiny new Mercedes would look nice in my driveway
Or a roundtrip ticket for a long vacation on a big fancy jet plane

There's only one thing that I want
Baby, it's hard to find and it's already mine, yeah

I don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, I don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
In ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love

All the ladies down at the hair salon are gonna brag about what they got
They'll walk in drippin' in their bobbles and trinkets and their whosits and whatnots

There's only one thing that I want
Baby, it's hard to find and it's already mine

Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, I don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
In ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love

Oh, I, I, I just need your love
I, I, I just need your love

Don't need ribbons and bows to cure my woes
No, I just need your love
Expensive rings or diamond things
No, I just need your love
No, I don't need much under the tree
Oh, but you can wrap me up
In ribbons and bows to cure my woes
'Cause I just need your love, yeah

Just need your love
Just need your love

// Countdown (Interlude) //

Standby
Who's ready for a great show?
Let me hear you scream! (10)
Camilla Cabello's gonna be here! (Nine, eight)
Kendall Jenner, everybody! (Seven, six)
Zooey Deschanel is here! (Five, four)
Fred Armisen's here! (Three, facing camera two, two)
Lana Del Rey! (One)
And the star of the show, Kacey Musgraves! (Three, two, one, action)

// Getting Ready (Interlude) //

[Dan Levy:]
At Christmas, I no more desire a rose than wish a snow in May's new-fangled shows
That, of course, is William Shakespeare and I have absolutely no idea what it means
But that isn't the story we're here to tell
On this arguably festive winter's evening
Kacey Musgraves is getting ready for her favorite holiday
No, not President's Day, Christmas
Unfortunately, she and her band only just got home from tour
Which didn't leave her much time to prepare
Get an assistant, Kacey, am I right?
It is Christmas Eve, after all

[Kacey Musgraves:]
Guys, has anybody seen that star ornament that my nana got me?
It goes on top of the tree
A star ornament?
Yeah (What's it look like?)
A star
I don't know
Okay, well if you see it, let me know
Because I gotta get ready for Christmas

[Dan Levy:]
The band got concerned hearing this
For it was already Christmas Eve
A day being famous for being one day before Christmas
And, clearly, Kacey had a lot to do

[Kacey Musgraves:]
Alright, yeah, I know I have a lot to do, but, I mean, is anyone gonna help me?
I made that banner
Oh, "Merry Christma—"
The printer ran out of ink
Who's that?
That might be one of your guests
Okay, but it's Christmas Eve and I thought people were gonna be coming tomorrow
Somebody called, said they couldn't do tomorrow, so I invited 'em
And did you let me know this?
I literally just did?
Alright, I'm coming

// Making A List (Interlude) //

Oh, wow, an unexpected duet!
Now with Leon out of her festively coiffed hair
Kacey and the band began to focus on a game plan

Alright, what am I going to need for Christmas tomorrow, besides alcohol?
Decorations? You don't really have any of those
What else?
Presents? Family?
Snacks, man
Yeah, snacks, where are all the snacks?
I have no snacks
You know, you didn't have to host Christmas this year
I know, but I love Christmas
I mean, yeah, the planning is stressful
But, you know, when you get to sing or hear a Christmas song that you really love
There's no better feeling

And so, even though Kacey had made virtually no progress with her Christmas preparations
She did, somehow, manage to find time for another song

// Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree //

Hey!
Oh, hey, Kacey!
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas to you!
Let's sing something
Let's do it!

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feelin' when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly"

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
'Cause everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
Woo!

You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly"

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
'Cause everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

Camila Cabello, everybody!
Merry Christmas!

// (Not So) Silent Night //

Hey, Fred. What are you doing in here?
Hey, Kacey, I'm just (Hey) catching up on some reading. It's so peaceful
Yeah, it really is. What are you reading?
It's a book of Christmas carols
Cool. You got any faves?
I kinda do. This one
Oh, Silent Night
Yeah, it's my favorite. I think it might be one of the most beautiful songs ever written
You know, we should just sing it together right now
Kacey, I can't think of anything more wonderful

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy infant so—

Sir. Sir, sir. Sir. Mister, what are you doing?
Well, I'm just putting this painting up
Well, do you have to do it right now?
Well, I mean, it's, it's meant for this, uh, song thing you're doing
Okay, well, I appreciate that, but don't you think you should've done it before we started singing?
Well, yeah, I'm sorry. I was on another job. It ran over. (Okay, but)
Okay? So I've got to do it now. Alright?
Well, sir. Sir, sir. Stop! Stop it, please. We are in the middle of singing
It's alright. I'm nearly done
So, sorry
It's okay
I'm really sorry
It's alright
One moment
He's putting up the painting. Yeah
There, we, go!
Great. Awesome
Great. (Done!)
(Thank you) Please leave. Off, off you go
No problem. I've got plenty more to be getting through on my list anyway. Bye bye
Thank you
So, sorry
See you later, Kacey. Big fan of your work
Thanks
Do you know that guy?
Never seen him
Well, where were we, um
Um, Silent Night
Yes
Gorgeous song. Love it
Beautiful song
'Kay
Here we go

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy infant so te—

Hey! Hey! What the heck? What? Hey! Stop! Stop! What the hell are you doing?
Yeah, I'm sorry, it's just that fixing this light is next on my list
I asked you to leave, okay? Are you kidding me? Can you choose another room to do this work in? (Yeah)
Yeah, no, fair point. Sorry 'bout that. I'll see what I can do. You carry on
Ye-ye-yes (Don't mind me)
Kacey
Incredible
What? Can we just do it one more time, please?
Let's do it one more time. (Okay) The most beautiful song ever written

Silent night, holy night—

Hey! Hey! What are you doing?
I'm sorry, i-i-it just turns out that all my jobs on my list are in this room
I-I-I, I'll tell you what, I'll try and do it quietly
Stop, stop. (It's a— you—) Stop. Stop it!
You're, you're not even doing it more quietly. It's just a little bit slower
It's kinda, it's worse
I want you to go, okay? Please go
Kacey, do you want me to go?
Yeah, I think, I think you should leave
See you later, Kacey
Bye
Alright, wonderful
Um, do you have time for just one more?
Should we do it?
Yeah. (Okay)
Is that cool?
I would love to
Alright, here we go
Yeah, okay
Okay
Here we go

Silent night, holy night
All is calm—

You know what? I think it's quite enough for this song. We've done it, right?
Forget it, yeah
Great song
Thanks
Sir?

// Amp It Up, Dan (Interlude) //

And so, Kacey had an emo moment in her bedroom
Because sometimes, just sometimes
A great singing career, a bunch of Grammys
And this over the top bathroom just aren't enough
Yet as Christmas Eve rolled on, would Kacey get ready in time?
Would she sing another holiday ditty that's overplayed in cafes and shopping mall restrooms?
And most importantly, would more celebrity friends continue to make surprise appearances that everyone sees coming but Kacey?
I don't know
Dan (Yes?)
Hey, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm just, um, I'm just freshening up in your bathroom
Look, if you could be just a little less negative when you narrate
That would be, that'd be nice
Wow, okay, um
It's Christmas, you know? We need Christmas cheer (Right)
Lots of cheer (Okay)
You know, happy...
You know, you're funny and that's kinda why we hired you, so, you know
So cheer then?
Cheer
For a corporate holiday in this political climate
Okay, sure, if cheer is what you want, Kacey
Then cheer is what you'll get
Thank you
Thank you
Right
Thank you so much, bye
Welcome back, friends!
Where was I? Oh right
It's Christmas Eve and Kacey still couldn't find her Nana's Christmas ornament

// Christmas Fail (Interlude) //

As the Christmas hour drew closer and closer
Kacey was feeling less and less relaxed
For it was too late to buy gifts for her band
Ugh, how did I forget to buy gifts for all the band?
You see, she had all year
I had all year
But the truth is, she just didn't know what to get those guys
I didn't know what to get those guys
And she'd been so busy
I've been so busy
Like super, super busy
They get it (Mmkay)
And to make matters worse, she'd just said all this out loud in front of the band themselves
Don't worry about it Kacey, we don't really need gifts
We do get paid and all
No, you guys do so much for me
I'm gonna figure this out, I promise
You know what? Maybe this'll help

// Cookies (Interlude) //

Hi Kacey, what's going on? Everything okay?
I guess
What's the matter?
I thought things were finally coming together
I'm just missing my family
Mm
Uh, it's not Christmas without going to Nana's house
Well, maybe this will make things better
I wanted to clear the air between us, so
I made you some Christmas cookies
You made these?
Yes
Processed in a factory
That's what I call my kitchen
Expired in 2017
I was looking out for your health
There's a price tag right-
Yeah, I would love to keep chatting about this but
I think there's more show to do
Yeah
And it could be time for another song

Troye!
There you are Kacey
Thanks for coming!
Of course!
I got a brand new song, you wanna sing it?
Yeah
Alright

// Glittery //

You shake me up and turn me upside down
Just like a snow globe
And every time you touch me
I shiver right down to my toes
You've got a strange effect on me
You know you make me feel so

Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart

Outside it's coming down
But here inside, it's warming up so
And when you take your time
You turn me on and make my life glow
You've got a strange effect on me
You make me feel so

Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart

Winter is so gray, it's like the ice is here to stay
But when you look at me, you know you melt it all away

Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart
Oh, so glittery
And I love the way you decorate my heart

// I'll Be Home Intro (Interlude) //

Well, that was sweet
Almost as sweet as these cookies
After Kacey finished wrapping gifts, it was time for another duet
And great duets can't happen without great friends.

I really, really appreciate you making the time to come here.
Of course! I'm so happy to be here.
Well, I would love to sing one of my favorite holiday classics with you.
Yes! Let's do it.
'Kay.

// I'll Be Home For Christmas //

I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams
Mmm

Lana Del Rey
Kacey Musgraves

// Nana! (Interlude) //

Hey
You guys really haven't seen that star topper for the tree?
No. Have you checked the top of the tree?
Not helpful dude
Who could that be?
I don't think I even know any more duets

Nana!
I thought you might like this
Where'd you find that?
You left it at my house last Christmas
Come here, come here, I missed you
I can't believe, what are you doing? Oh my-
Come here
I have so much to show you
I've been filming this amazing thing
You came all the way here from Texas?
I did
Yeah? How was the drive?

And so, as Kacey hugged her nana
Our age old tale of Christmas seemed to be coming to a close

I love you
I love you more
Christmas is not Christmas without you, so thanks for coming
Thank you

The whole world is very, very sweet
So sweet, but this narrator has to leave

Whoa, uh, where are you going?
Sorry, I, I gotta run
Like, right now?
Yeah, um, seeing you with our nana
My nana
Sure
It just reminded me that
This isn't just some big corporate holiday, it's
It's also about being with the people you love
And getting gifts
So, I booked a flight home
Wow, uh, that's, that's really sweet
Thank you so much
Little unprofessional
Wow
But I get it
And the Christian half of me finally gets what this holiday's all about
You did it Kacey, look around
You made Christmas happen
Merry Christmas, Dan
Merry Christmas, Kacey
Also, taking a gift
Beautiful home
Love what you did with it
