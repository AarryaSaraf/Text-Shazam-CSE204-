// Silver Lining //

Woke up on the wrong side of rock bottom
You're all out of pennies and the well it done run dry
You'd light 'em up and smoke 'em if you had 'em
But you just ain't got 'em
Yeah, ain't we always looking for a bluer sky?

If you're ever gonna find a silver lining
It's gotta be a cloudy day
It's gotta be a cloudy day
If you wanna fill your bottle up with lightning
You're gonna have to stand in the rain
You're gonna have to stand in the rain

Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo

The lemonade keeps turning into lemons
And you wear your heart on a ripped unraveled sleeve
Been run through the wringer
And pushed plum to your limit
You say you're just unlucky but luck ain't what you need

'Cause if you're ever gonna find a four leaf clover
You gotta get a little dirt on your hands
You gotta get a little dirt on your hands
And if you wanna find a head that fits your shoulder
You're gonna have to go to the dance
You're gonna have to go to the dance

If you wanna find the honey
You can't be scared of the bees
And if you wanna see the forest
You're gonna have to look past the trees

Cause if you're ever gonna find a silver lining
It's gotta be a cloudy day
It's gotta be a cloudy day
If you wanna fill your bottle up with lightning
You're gonna have to stand in the rain
You're gonna have to stand in the rain

Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo, yea

Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo hoo hoooo
Hoo, hoo, hoo

// My House //

Who needs a house up on a hill
When you can have one on four wheels
And take it anywhere the wind might blow?
You don't ever have to mow the yard
Just hang a map and throw a dart
And pray to God the engine starts and go

Water and electric and a place to drain the septic
Any KOA is A-OK as long as I'm with you
So come on hitch your wagon
To the living room I'm draggin'
If I can't bring you to my house
I'll bring my house to you

Parking lots and county lines
And counting mile marker signs
Where the buffalo and antelope all roam
Greetings from Niagara Falls
One more postcard for the wall
Off in our own sweet home away from home

Water and electric and a place to drain the septic
Any KOA is A-OK as long as I'm with you
So come on hitch your wagon
To the living room I'm draggin'
If I can't bring you to my house
I'll bring my house to you

And Washington and Idaho
And Oregon and away we go
To Tennessee and Arkansas
No, we won't stop 'til we've seen 'em all
'Til we've seen 'em all

So what else could you ask for?
You don't even need a passport
To see the whole world from our living room
So come on hitch your wagon
To the happiness I'm draggin'
If I can't bring you to my house
I'll bring my house to you
If I can't bring you to my house
I'll bring my house to you

It don't matter where we go
We'll never be alone
Anywhere beside you is a place that I'll call home
[2x]

// Merry Go 'Round //

If you ain't got two kids by 21,
You're probably gonna die alone.
Least that's what tradition told you.
And it don't matter if you don't believe,
Come Sunday morning, you best be there in the front row like you're supposed to.

Same hurt in every heart.
Same trailer, different park.

Mama's hooked on Mary Kay.
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane.
Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down.
Mary, Mary quite contrary.
We get bored, so, we get married
Just like dust, we settle in this town.
On this broken merry go 'round and 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows and it ain't slowin' down.
This merry go 'round.

We think the first time's good enough.
So, we hold on to high school love.
Sayin' we won't end up like our parents.
Tiny little boxes in a row.
Ain't what you want, it's what you know.
Just happy in the shoes you're wearin'.
Same checks we're always cashin' to buy a little more distraction.

'Cause mama's hooked on Mary Kay.
Brother's hooked on Mary Jane.
Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down.
Mary, Mary, quite contrary.
We get bored, so, we get married.
Just like dust, we settle in this town.
On this broken merry go 'round and 'round and 'round we go
Where it stops nobody knows and it ain't slowin' down.
This merry go 'round.

Mary, Mary, quite contrary.
We're so bored until we're buried.
Just like dust, we settle in this town.
On this broken merry go 'round.
Merry go 'round.

Jack and Jill went up the hill.
Jack burned out on booze and pills.
And Mary had a little lamb.
Mary just don't give a damn no more.

// Dandelion //

Picked you out and picked you up
Hoping that my luck would change
I let the summer fill my lungs
And superstition fill my brain

Dandelion
A million little wishes float across the sky
But it's a waste of breath and it's a waste of time I know
Cause just like him, you always leave me cryin' dandelion

Sent you dancing on the breeze
And like a stupid little girl
I spent my wishes on a weed
Thinking it could change my world

Dandelion
A million little wishes float across the sky
But it's a waste of breath and it's a waste of time I know
Cause just like him, you always leave me cryin' dandelion

Falling stars and lucky pennies
Have let me down so many times before
And you're just one more
Oh, dandelion

Oh, dandelion
I'm always blowing kisses out across the sky
But it's a waste of breath and it's a waste of time I know
Cause just like him, you always leave me cryin' dandelion

Dandelion

// Blowin' Smoke //

Between the lunch and dinner rush
Kelly caught that outbound bus for Vegas
We're all out here talking trash, making bets
Lips wrapped round our cigarettes
She always thought she was too good to be a waitress

Well, we all say that we'll quit someday
When our ship comes in
We'll just sail away

But we're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
Out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
We're just blowin' smoke

Well Janie got divorced again
Her ex-husband's in the pen
From two to five, five to ten and longer
Brenda's traded smokes for cake
Still hadn't lost that baby weight
And that baby's about to graduate
From college

I'm just flicking ash
Into the tray
Tell them both it'll be okay

But I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm out here goin' broke
Hey yeah
Yeah we're just blowin' smoke

We all say that we'll
Quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake, yeah
We all say that we'll
Quit someday
When our nerves ain't shot
And our hands don't shake

Wipe down the bar, take out the trash
Light one up and count my cash
Swear I'm never coming back again

I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
I'm just blowin' smoke
Hey yeah
Out here going broke
Hey yeah
Yeah we're just blowin' smoke

// I Miss You //

Oh my God it's you, I never thought I'd see you here.
Looks like all is well, like you're having a hell of a good time.
Me? Not gonna lie.

Got the sunshine on my shoulders
Got a fistful of four leaf clovers
Yeah my cup runneth over
My sky is blue
Been kissed by Lady Luck,
The stars are all lined up,
Every arrow that I aim is true
But I miss you.

You can't have your cake and eat it too, I should have known
Cause what good is good anyway
And having it all is just a state of mind
And I, I got no reason to cry

I got the sunshine on my shoulders
Got a fistful of four leaf clovers
Yeah my cup runneth over
My sky is blue
Been kissed by Lady Luck,
The stars are all lined up,
Every arrow that I aim is true
But I miss you.

Been kissed by Lady Luck,
The stars are all lined up,
Every arrow that I aim is true.
I got a big smile on my face
It's the best one I can fake
I'm as happy as half a heart can do
But I miss you.

// Step Off //

You sure look real pretty in your glass house
You probably think youâre too good to take the trash out
Well, are you dumb or are you blind?
Cause itâs a real fine line
Between telling a joke and turning a knife
Donât wreck my reputation
Let me wreck my own

Step off, step off
Yeah youâre getting too close to me
With all your negativity
Just get lost
Just tryna to make a little difference here
So, why you gotta interfere?
Just keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks
When you finally get to the top
Step off, yeah

You screwed everybody over in this town
There ainât nothing between you and the cold hard ground
Keep running your mouth and stretching the truth
You just might find a hole in your parachute
'Cause whatever gets you high
Will always bring you down

So, step off, step off
Yeah, youâre getting too close to me
With all your negativity
Just get lost
Just tryna make a little difference here
So, why you gotta interfere?
Just keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks
When you finally get to the top, hmmm
Step off

Sticks and stones
May build a throne
But youâll be up there all alone

So, step off
Yeah, yeah, step off

And keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks, yeah
When you finally get to the top
Step off, step off, step off

// Back On The Map //

Gotten too far off the map
Not so sure I can get back.
Was I the one who drifted off?
Did I take advantage of good love?
'Cause I swear I did everything I could've done
But what good is love without the trust?
Does anybody wanna

Put me back, put me back on the map?
I'd be all about it
I'd do anything, anything
That you asked
'Cause honestly I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone, anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map

Something steady, something good
Is probably closer than I thought it could be
All this off the grid is getting old
And my compass says I'm getting close
But I don't know, it's hard to read
So I'll just keep moving
Hoping someone out there's gonna

Put me back, put me back on the map
I'd be all about it
I'd do anything, anything
That you asked
'Cause honestly I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone, anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map

S.O.S, it's out of hand
Just holding out for love again
I'm sending signals, find me fast
I know, I know
There's gotta be somebody who can

Put me back, put me back on the map
Cause I'd be all about it
I'd do anything anything
That you asked
'Cause honestly I've been
Out of touch and out of reach
Just looking for someone, anything
That's finally gonna put me back
Put me back on the map

// Keep It To Yourself //

You turn on the light
Then you turn it back off
'Cause sleeping alone, yeah it ain't what you thought
It's the drip of the sink
It's the click of the clock
And you're wondering if I'm sleeping

You heard from your friends
That I'm doing okay
And you're thinking, maybe you made a mistake
And you want me to know
But I don't wanna know
How you're feeling

Keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk
And it's late
And you're missing me like hell
Keep it to yourself

If you see me out and I'm standing alone
Well it don't mean that I'm gonna need a ride home
If you walk up to me like it ain't what it is
I know that it ain't gonna end with a kiss

So keep it to yourself
If you think that you still love me
Put it on a shelf
If you're looking for someone
Make it someone else
When you're drunk
And it's late
And you're missing me like hell
Just keep it to yourself
Yeah, keep it to yourself

Yeah, when you're drunk
And it's late
And you're sad
And you hate going home alone
Cause you're missing me like hell
Keep it to yourself
Yeah, keep it to yourself

Yeah, keep it to yourself

// Stupid //

Plays you like a fiddle
Shakes you like a rattle
Takes away your gun
And sends you into battle
Huffs and it puffs
'Til it blows your house down
And you don't know your heart
From a hole in the ground

Oh whoa oh whoa
Oh whoa oh whoa

Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking stupid
Stupid

Girl meets boy
And boy he's a looker
Can't separate the salt from the sugar
There's nothing in your pockets
There's footprints on your face
You can't tell anymore
If you're the rabbit or the snake
Hey!

Oh whoa oh whoa
Oh whoa oh whoa

Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking stupid
Stupid

I drink to feel
I smoke to breathe
Just look what love
Has done to me

Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking so damn
Stupid love is stupid
Don't know why we always do it
Finally find it just to lose it
Always wind up looking stupid
Stupid

// Follow Your Arrow //

If you save yourself for marriage
You're a bore
If you don't save yourself for marriage
You're a whore-able person
If you won't have a drink
Then you're a prude
But they'll call you a drunk
As soon as you down the first one

If you can't lose the weight
Then you're just fat
But if you lose too much
Then you're on crack
You're damned if you do
And you're damned if you don't
So you might as well just do
Whatever you want
So

Make lots of noise
Kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls
If that's something you're into
When the straight and narrow
Gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow
Wherever it points, yeah
Follow your arrow
Wherever it points

If you don't go to church
You'll go to hell
If you're the first one
On the front row
You're self-righteous
Son of a-
Can't win for losing
You'll just disappoint 'em
Just 'cause you can't beat 'em
Don't mean you should join 'em

So make lots of noise
Kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls
If that's something you're into
When the straight and narrow
Gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow
Wherever it points, yeah
Follow your arrow
Wherever it points

Say what you think
Love who you love
'Cause you just get
So many trips 'round the sun
Yeah, you only
Only live once

So make lots of noise
Kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls
If that's what you're into
When the straight and narrow
Gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, I would
And follow your arrow
Wherever it points, yeah
Follow your arrow
Wherever it points

// It Is What It Is //

I think we're thinking too hard, 
So, put on your shoes and get in your car, 
Put it in drive and point it this way, 
We don't have to talk, 
You don't have to stay, 

But I ain't got no one sleeping with me, 
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be,
Maybe I love you,
Maybe I'm just kind of bored,
It is what it is
'Til it ain't anymore

We've tried being apart,
But the truth is,
We are who we are,
We're so much alike,
It ain't a good thing,
Too dumb to give up,
Too stubborn to change

But I ain't got no one sleeping with me,
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be,
Maybe I love you,
Maybe I'm just kind of bored,
It is what it is
'Til it ain't anymore

'Til something better comes along,
'Til whatever we have is gone

But I ain't got no one sleeping with me,
And you ain't got nowhere that you need to be,
Maybe I love you,
Maybe I'm just kind of bored,
It is what it is
'Til it ain't anymore
Yeah, it is what it is
'Til it ain't anymore
