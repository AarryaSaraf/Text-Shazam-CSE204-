// Christmas Don't Be Late //

Christmas, Christmas time is near
Time for toys and time for cheer
I've been good, but I can't last
Hurry Christmas, hurry fast
Want a plane that loops the loop
And I want a hula-hoop
I can hardly stand the wait
Please, Christmas, don't be late

Want a plane that loops the loop
And I still want a hula-hoop
I can hardly stand the wait
Please, Christmas, don't be late
I can hardly stand the wait
Please, Christmas, don't be late

// A Willie Nice Christmas //

[Kacey Musgraves:]
I'm gonna wrap my presents up in red bandanas
And leave some special cookies out for Santa
Throw my troubles to the wind 'til we're back on the road again
Here's to finding your own little piece on Earth

And I hope you have a really
A really, really, Willie nice Christmas
If you're in Luckenbach or Waikiki
Yeah, I hope you have a really
A really, really, Willie nice Christmas
And may we all stay higher than the angel on top of the tree

[Willie Nelson:]
Don't get caught up in the hustle and the bustle
This time of year ain't supposed to be so stressful
Here's to easily silent nights and finding your own paradise
'Cause whatever family, might call your own

[Both:]
And I hope you have a really
A really, really, Willie nice Christmas
And may it be a lot more green than blue
Yeah, I hope you have a really
A really, really, Willie nice Christmas
And, Willie, Happy New Year, too

[Kacey Musgraves:]
Have a Willie happy Hanukkah
Feliz Navidad-ukkah
A Willie happy Kwanzaa 'cause it's all the same
A Mele Kalikimaka, hey
Whatever way you wanna say
Just have yourself a

[Both:]
Really, really, really
A really, really, Willie nice Christmas
Whether you're in Luckenbach or Waikiki
I hope you have a really
A really, really, Willie nice Christmas
May we all get higher than the angel on top of the tree
And may we all stay higher than the angel on top of the tree

Happy Holidays from Willie and me
And Merry Christmas, everybody

// I Want A Hippopotamus For Christmas //

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
I don't want a doll, no dinky tinker toy
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
I don't think Santa Claus will mind, do you?
He won't have to use our dirty chimney flue
Just bring him through the front door
That's the easy thing to do

I can see me now on Christmas morning
Creeping down the stairs
Oh, what a joy and what surprise
When I open up my eyes
To see my hippo hero standing there

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
No crocodiles or rhinoceroses
I only like hippopotamuses
And hippopotamuses like me, too

Mom says the hippo would eat me up
But then, my teacher says a hippo is a vegetarian
There's lots of room for him in our two car garage
I'd feed him there and wash him there
And give him his massage

I can see me now on Christmas morning
Creeping down the stairs
Oh, what a joy and what surprise
When I open up my eyes
To see my hippo hero standing there

I want a hippopotamus for Christmas
Only a hippopotamus will do
No crocodiles or rhinoceroses-es
I only like hippopotamuses-es
And hippopotamuses like me, too

// Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer //

Well, here's one for all the little kids
You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all?

Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer had a very shiny nose
Well, and if you ever saw it, you would even say it glowed
(Like a light bulb)
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
Oh, they never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games
Oh, then one foggy Christmas Eve
Oh, Santa came to say (Ho ho ho)
Rudolph, with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Well, then all reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee (Hee hee)
Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer, you'll go down in history

Well, then one foggy Christmas Eve
Oh, Santa came to say (Ho ho ho)
Rudolph, with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Well, then all all reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee (Hee hee)
Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer, you'll go down in history
Yeah, you'll go down, go down in history

// What Are You Doing New Year's Eve //

When the bells all ring and the horns all blow
And the couples that we know are finally kissing
Will I be with you or will I be among the missing?

Maybe it's much too early in the game
Oh, but I thought I'd ask you just the same
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?

Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight
When it's exactly 12 o'clock midnight
Welcoming in the New Year, New Year's Eve

Oh, maybe I'm crazy to suppose
That I'd ever be the one you chose
Out of the thousand invitations you receive

Oh, but in case I stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?

Oh, maybe I'm crazy to suppose
That I'd ever be the one you chose
Out of the thousand invitations you receive

Oh, but in case I stand one little chance
Here comes the jackpot question in advance
What are you doing New Year's, New Year's Eve?
