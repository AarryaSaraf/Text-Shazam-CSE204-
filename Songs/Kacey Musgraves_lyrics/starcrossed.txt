Album: starcrossed

// star-crossed //

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Let me set the scene
Two lovers ripped right at the seams
They woke up from the perfect dream
And then the darkness came
I signed the papers yesterday
You came and took your things away
And moved out of the home we made
And gave you back your name

What have we done?
Did we fly too high just to get burned by the sun?
No one's to blame
'Cause we called all the angels to save us
Called them by name
But I guess they got lost
Star-crossed

(Star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed)
(Star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed)
(Star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed)
(Star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed)
Star-crossed, ah
Ah, star-crossed
Star-crossed, ah
Star-crossed
Star-crossed
Star-crossed

// good wife //

Let's go back to the beginning
I just wanna be a good wife

Wake him up nice and slow
Bring him coffee in bed
Listen to his problems
Tell him that I understand
Touch him so he knows in his heart he's the only one
Try to loosen up and be more fun
Yeah, I could be more fun

God, help me be a good wife
'Cause he needs me
Even when he's not right
He still needs me

Help me let go of all the things that make me mad
At the end of the day, he's gotta know that I've got his back
And if he comes home stressed out, I could pack him a bowl
Just let him be himself, don't try to control

God, help me be a good wife
'Cause he needs me
Even when he's not right
Yeah, he still needs me

And the truth is
I could probably make it on my own
But without him
This house just wouldn't be a home
And I don't wanna be alone

God, help me be a good wife
Yeah, 'cause he needs me
And even when he's not right
I know he still needs me

Help me be a good wife
'Cause I need him
Ooh, And I know, I know, I know
Yeah, I know, I know, I know
That I need him

Help me be a good wife
I just wanna be a good wife

// cherry blossom //

Early April you walked up to me
Changing colors on city streets
Petals surrounding us in every shade of pink
We happened quickly as humans do
Summer was coming and change was too
Look at me now, I'm falling at your feet

I'm your cherry blossom baby
Don't let me blow away
I hope you haven't forgotten
Tokyo wasn't built in a day
I'm your cherry blossom baby
I don't wanna blow away

When we're on fire
It's something to see
No one can question the chemistry
Even in nature timing is everything

I'm your cherry blossom baby
Don't let me blow away
I hope you haven't forgotten
Tokyo wasn't built in a day
Yeah I'm your cherry blossom baby
I don't wanna blow away
Away
Away

I'm your cherry blossom baby
Don't let me blow away
I hope you haven't forgotten
Tokyo wasn't built in a day
I'm your cherry blossom baby
Don't wanna blow away
Away
Away
Away
Away
Away

// simple times //

Every day felt like Friday
Walking to the 7-Eleven
Me and all of my best friends
We were always together
I remember talking on the phone all night
Didn't know it was a simple time

Wish that I could put this game on pause
Skip this round, take the headset off
Put my lip gloss on
Kick it at the mall like there's nothing wrong
I need to step away
If I don't, I'm gonna go insane
'Cause being grown up kind of sucks
And I'm really just missing the simple times, uh huh

I think I'm going off of the deep end
I wanna wake up on an island
Throw everybody a peace sign
Put all the static on silent
We could stay up all night
Pour one out for the simple times

Wish that I could put this game on pause
Skip this round, take the headset off
Put my lip gloss on
Kick it at the mall like there's nothing wrong
I need to step away
And if I don't, I'm gonna go insane
'Cause being grown up kind of sucks
And I'm really just missing the simple times, uh huh

There's nothing really going on
But I heard about a rager
I won't be waiting by the phone
So you can hit me on the pager

Wish that I could put this game on pause
Skip this round, take the headset off
Put my high-tops on
Kick it at the mall like there's nothing wrong
I need to step away
If I don't, I'm gonna go insane
'Cause being grown up kind of sucks
And I'm really just missing the simple times, uh huh

// if this was a movie.. //

Am I the stone in your pocket
That's weighing you down?
Or the face in your locket
That you wear all over town?
I'd be your silver lining
Not a cloud full of rain
And the music would rise up
When I said your name

If this was a movie
I'd be surprised
Hearing your car
Coming up the drive
And you'd run up the stairs
You'd hold my face
Say we're being stupid
And we'd fall back into place
If this was a movie
If this was a movie

If this was a movie
Love would be enough
To save us from the darkness
That's inside both of us
And we'd get away
And we'd be okay

If this was a movie
I'd be surprised
Hearing your car
Coming up the drive
Then you'd run up the stairs
You'd hold my face
Say we're being stupid
And we'd fall back into place
If this was a movie
But it's not a movie

// justified //

It was a fun, strange summer
I rolled on, didn't think of you
We lost touch with each other
Fall came and I had to move

Moving backwards, hurt comes after
Healing doesn't happen in a straight line

If I cry just a little
And then laugh in the middle
If I hate you then I love you
Then I change my mind
If I need just a little
More time to deal with the fact
That you should have treated me right
Then I'm more than just a little justified
I'm more than just a little justified

To touch somebody
You know I tried to make that you
And when you lied and said, you didn't want me
Tell me what was I supposed to do?

Moving on was feeling strong
But healing doesn't happen in a straight line

If I cry just a little
And then laugh in the middle
If I hate you and I love you
Then I change my mind
If I need just a little
More time to deal with the fact
That you should have treated me right
Then I'm more than just a little justified
I'm more than just a little justified

If I die just a little
Inside just a little
If I want you and I call you
Then I change my mind
If I need just a little
More time to deal with the fact
That I should have treated you right
I'm more than just a little

If I cry just a little
And then laugh in the middle
If I hate you and I love you
Then I change my mind (A million times)
If I need just a little
More time to deal with the fact
That you should have treated me right
Then I'm more than just a little justified
I'm more than just a little justified

// angel //

If I was an angel
I wouldn't have to try
So hard to save you
Or show you how to fly

If I was an angel
I wouldn't get so mad
It'd be easy to be grateful
For everything I have
You'd only get the best of me

I'd pull you out of the darkness
Keep you out of the rain
Everything would be better
I'd never have to change
I'd never have to change

If I was an angel
I'd use only pretty words
And when I'm talking to you
It would never hurt
You'd only get the best of me
I'd never make you wanna leave

I'd pull you out of the darkness
Keep you out of the rain
Everything would be better
You'd never have to change
You'd never have to change

But something's gotta change

I'd pull you out of the darkness
Always keep you safe
Everything would be better
I'd never have to change
I'd never have to change

// breadwinner //

Here's what he'll do
He'll play it cool
When he hangs out with a woman like you
Say he ain't pressed by all your success
Tell you he's different than all of the rest

You're gonna give it all and give it all
But you won't get it back
I'm telling you, it's gonna hurt
Stay away from a boy like that

He wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore
He wants your shimmer
To make him feel bigger
Until he starts feeling insecure
I wish somebody would've told me the truth
See, he's never gonna know what to do
With a woman like you
With a woman like you

I see the games a mile away
They only end when another heart breaks
But all of his wounds ain't an excuse
For you to put up with how he treats you

You're gonna give it all and give it all
But you won't get it back
I'm telling you, it's gonna hurt
Stay away from a boy like that

He wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore
He wants your shimmer
To make him feel bigger
Until he starts feeling insecure
I wish somebody would've told me the truth
See, he's never gonna know what to do
With a woman like you
With a woman like you

I can sleep at night
Knowing I really tried
I put in the time
But the fault isn't mine

That he wants a (Breadwinner)
(He wants your dinner)
(Until he ain't hungry anymore)

He wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore (Anymore)
He wants your shimmer
To make him feel bigger
Until he starts feeling insecure
I wish somebody would've told me the truth
See, he's never gonna know what to do
With a woman like you
With a woman like you

With a woman like you
And me
He likes what he sees

// camera roll //

Don't go through your camera roll
So much you don't know
That you've forgotten
What a trip
The way you can flip
Through all the good parts of it
I shouldn't have done it

Chronological order
And nothing but torture
Scroll too far back
That's what you get
I don't wanna see 'em
But I can't delete 'em
It just doesn't feel right yet
Not yet

All the best, that's all that's left
Cruel evidence
It does me no favors
I should know
It's a place not to go
When I'm alone
I'll just feel bad later

Chronological order
And nothing but torture
Scroll too far back
That's what you get
I don't wanna see 'em
But I can't delete 'em
It just doesn't feel right yet
Not yet

Look at me, I'm living all alone
And now you're only living in my phone

Anyway, thanks
For all the nights and the days
And everything that you gave
I'll never erase it
There's one where we look so in love
Before we lost all the sun
And I made you take it

// easier said //

I can write a melody, and maybe
I could even make it rhyme
I've never been scared of what I wanted to be, and you know me
I've never been afraid to shine
I built a rocket ship and I went to space
Even way out there, I kept my head on straight
So tell me, why

It ain't easy
It ain't easy to love someone
I've been tryin' and I found out
That it's easier said than done

I can wake up with a heart of gold, sometimes
I can be the one you need me to be
Never said that I was easy to hold, but I love you
And I know that you love me

But it ain't easy
It ain't easy to love someone
I've been tryin' and I found out
That it's easier said than done
Easier said than done
It's easier said than done

It ain't easy
It should be easy to love someone
We've been tryin'
And we found out
That it's easier said than done

// hookup scene //

This hookup scene
Ain't all that it's made out to be
You get your fill and leave empty
More lonely than before
And you lay beside
Somebody you know isn't right
I make believe it's love then I
Start lookin' for the door

If you've got someone to love
And you've almost given up
Hold on tight
Despite, the way they make you mad
'Cause you might not even know that you don't have it so bad

A pretty face
Might get you far
But still it can't replace
The kind of real connection that I crave
The kind we don't have anymore
And I get in my head
Analyzing what I had
It's a chapter that ain't coming back
I could have learned to love it more

So if you've got someone to love
And you've almost given up
Hold on tight
Despite the way they make you mad
'Cause you might not even know that you don't have it so bad

If you've got someone to love
And you've almost given up
Hold on tight
Despite the way they make you sad
'Cause I wish I would have known we didn't have it so bad
I wish I would have known I didn't have it so bad

// keep lookin' up //

Grew up in the sticks where there ain't no light
But the stars were big and bright
If they told me no
I would always wonder why

But I tried to be good
And keep my head down
But there was too much sky around
And my daddy said

Keep lookin' up
Don't let the world bring you down
Keep your head in the clouds
And your feet on the ground
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up

They come to me in different ways
Beautiful and strange
I've seen fire burning in the sky
Things that I can't explain
I've seen truth step into the light
And true love turn into pain

But I keep looking up
Won't let the world bring me down
Keep your head in the clouds
And your feet on the ground
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up

You never know what you may find
I've seen strange things happen all the time
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up
Oh, keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up
Keep lookin' up

// what doesn't kill me //

I'm not afraid of a bite
I can take it
Watch how I bend
But I'm, I'm not breaking

I've been to hell and back
Golden hour faded black
Say that it ain't coming back
Ain't coming back

But you're gonna feel me
You're gonna feel me
You're gonna feel me
When I'm done
When I'm done
What doesn't kill me
What doesn't kill me
What doesn't kill me
Better run
Better run

I'm not afraid to connect with something real
And just let it go when I know
That it just don't fit in

I've been to hell and back
Golden hour faded black
Say that it ain't coming back
Ain't coming back

But you're gonna feel me
You're gonna feel me
You're gonna feel me
When I'm done
When I'm done
What doesn't kill me
What doesn't kill me
What doesn't kill me
Better run
Better run

What doesn't kill me
You're gonna feel me
What doesn't kill me
Better run
Better run

// there is a light //

There is a light
At the end of the tunnel
There is a light
Inside of me

Tried not to show it
To make you feel good
Pretended I couldn't
When you knew that I could

I won't cry
When the cold wind blows
Gonna let it shine
'Cause now I know

There is a light
At the end of the tunnel
There is a light
Inside of me
There was a shadow of a doubt
But baby it's never going out
There is a light
Inside of me

There is a light

There is a light
It's so bright
But I've been hiding it
There is a light
Inside of me
There is a light

There is a light inside of me, uh huh
There is a light inside
There is a light

Oh, there is a light
Oh
There is a light

There is a light inside of me, uh huh
There is a light inside
There is a light

There is a light inside of me, uh huh
There is a light inside

// gracias a la vida //

Gracias a la vida, que me ha dado tanto
Me dio dos luceros que cuando los abro
Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco
Y en el alto cielo su fondo estrellado
Y en las multitudes el hombre que yo amo

Gracias a la vida, que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el oído que en todo su ancho
Graba, noche y días, grillos y canarios
Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos
Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado

Gracias a la vida, que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el sonido y el abecedario
Con él las palabras, que pienso y declaro
Madre, amigo, hermano y luz alumbrando
La ruta del alma del que estoy amando

Gracias a la vida, que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados
Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos
Playas y desiertos, montañas y llanos
Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio

Gracias a la vida, que me ha dado tanto
Me dio el corazón que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano
Cuando miro el bueno tan lejos del malo
Cuando miro el fondo de tus ojos claros

Gracias a la vida, que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto
Así yo distingo dicha de quebranto
Los dos materiales que forman mi canto
Y el canto de ustedes que es el mismo canto
Y el canto de todos que es mi propio canto

Gracias a la vida
