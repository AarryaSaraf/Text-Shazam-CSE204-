// All Is Found //

Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a river full of memory
Sleep, my darling, safe and sound
For in this river all is found
All is found
When all is lost, then all is found

In her waters, deep and true
Lie the answers and a path for you
Dive down deep into her sound
But not too far or you'll be drowned

She will sing to those who'll hear
And in her song, all magic flows
But can you brave what you most fear?
Can you face what the river knows?

Until the river's finally crossed
You'll never feel the solid ground
You have to get a little lost
On your way to being found

Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a mother full of memory
Come, my darling, homeward bound
Where all is lost, then all is found

All is found
All is found

// Apologize //

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down
But wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around
And say

That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late, too late, oh, oh

I'd take another chance
Take a fall, take a shot for you, oh, oh
I need you like a heart needs a beat
That's nothing new, yeah
I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue
And you say
Sorry, like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late, oh, oh
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said, it's too late to apologize

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground

// Can't Help Falling In Love //

Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you?

Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you
For I can't help falling in love with you

// Easy (Remix) //

Woo!

You ran away to find something to say
I went astray to make it okay
And he made it easy, darlin'
I'm still in love and I say that because
I know how it seems between you and me
It hasn't been easy darlin'

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo
Burnin' the tears right out my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please don't leave me, leave me

I'm not a saint so just give me the blame
I know what I want and it gets in my way
I know I'm not easy, darlin'
(I'm kinda a freak, my darlin')
When you see me out
I hope the taste in your mouth
Is still as sweet as I wish it could be
Believe me, darlin'
Ay, yeah, yeah, yeah

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo
Burnin' the tears right out my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please don't leave me, don't leave me

We knew what was under the surface
And lived like it wouldn't hurt us
But it hurt us

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo
Burnin' the tears right out my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please don't leave me, no
Don't leave me

He made it easy
Please don't leave me
He made it easy
Please don't leave me

// Five Finger Discount //

Well I know you stole my panties 'cause I have the matching bra
My girlfriend said she saw you out with my favorite red dress on
She said you were dancin' in my black snakeskin flats
Actin' like a stripper and you didn't even match

You want a five finger discount
But nothin' in life is free
How 'bout you work hard for what you want 
Instead of liftin' it from me
If it'll help just a little, I'll give you the middle 
Ought to help you cut the cost
Can't give you a five finger discount
But here's twenty percent off 

I can't believe what you done to me after lettin' you in my house
Who knew you were casin' the joint, while sleepin' on my couch
I'm sure you'll find forgiveness, yeah I'm willing to bet
'Cause that's my grandma's Jesus necklace hangin' 'round your neck

You want a five finger discount
But nothin' in life is free
How 'bout you work hard for what you want 
Instead of jackin' it from me
If it'll help just a little, I'll give you the middle 
Ought to help you cut the cost
Can't give you a five finger discount
But here's twenty percent off 

The cops ain't gonna help me
But this town is pretty small
I'm gonna find out when I find you that
Pretty girls can brawl 

'Cause you want a five finger discount
But nothin' in life is free
Well you better hope that karma ain't a bigger bitch than me
If it'll help just a little, I'll give you the middle 
Ought to help you cut the cost
Can't give you a five finger discount 
But here's twenty percent off 
Yeah a five finger discount
But here's twenty percent off
Screw you

// Fix You //

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
To fix you

Yeah, lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

// Heartache Song //

They make me clean up my room
And put away my toys
When company comes
I can't make any noise, oo-ah, ah-ah, ah-oh
They say I must take a bath
But I've had one before
I'm just so upset
I can't take anymore
Don't they remember
All the heartache so deep
When somebody tells you
It's time now for sleep, oo-ah, ah-ah, ah-oh
Please let me stay up too late
I don't wanna go to bed
I'm not even tired
I just wanna play instead
Won't somebody listen
To these feelings of mine
Can't anyone hear me
Or do I have to whine
I don't want to clean up my room
Don't wanna put away my toys
When company comes
I prefer making noise
I don't want any bath
Oh, and I never did
It's a difficult world
When your only a kid
Thank you, Goodnight

// Kansas City Star //

Got a letter just this morning, it was postmarked Omaha
It was typed and neatly written, offering me this better job
Better job and higher wages, expenses paid and a car
But I'm on TV here locally, and I can't quit, I'm a star
I come on the TV grinning, wearing pistols and a hat
It's a kiddy show and I'm a hero of the younger set
I'm the number one attraction in every supermarket parking lot
I'm the queen of Kansas City, no thanks Omaha, thanks a lot

Kansas City Star, that's what I are
Yodelee-da-lady, you ought to see my car
I got a big old Cadillac with wired wheels
I got rhinestones on my spokes
I've got credit down at the grocery and my barber tells me jokes
I'm the number one attraction in every supermarket parking lot
I'm the queen of Kansas City, no thanks Omaha, thanks a lot

Kansas City Star, that's what I are
Ha-delee-da-lady, you ought to see my car
I drive a big old Cadillac with wired wheels
I got rhinestones on the spokes
I've got credit down at my grocery store
And my barber tells me jokes
I'm the number one attraction in every supermarket parking lot
I'm the queen of Kansas City, no thanks Omaha, thanks a lot
I'm the queen of Kansas City, no thanks Omaha, thanks a lot
I'm the queen of Kansas City, no thanks Omaha, thanks for nothing

// Love Is A Liar //

You take another pill just to kill another hour, ha
and then you're smokin' cigarettes and you're countin' dead flowers
'cause you're crazy, and screwed two ways from Tuesday...

Love is a liar,
makes you think you're on a high when you're really just on a high wire
If love wore pants they'd always be on fire
Love is a liar

Candy coated promises they're always tryin' to sell ya,
But there's a whole lot of stories that the books never tell ya,
and you're cryin' and sleepin' in your clothes...

'Cause love is a liar,
makes you think you're on a high when you're really just on a high wire
If love wore pants they'd always be on fire
Love is a liar

There's a reason for the rain and it ain't just the grass
'cause the grass is always greener through the rose colored glass
There's a reason for the pain is what they say if you ask
There's a reason for the rain and it ain't just the grass
There's a reason for the rain and it ain't just the grass

'Cause you're crazy, and screwed two ways from Tuesday...
'cause love is a liar,
makes you think you're on a high when you're really just on a high wire
If love wore pants they'd always be on fire
Love is a liar
yeah, love is a liar (here we go good two three always push you in your face can't eat can't sleep why's it always gotta be a liar)

// My Own Road //

Here I go breakin' my own heart again
I didn't know that things could get this outta hand
If I called home right now, I'd guarantee
I'd get my share of advice that I don't want, but I might need

'Cause Daddy says at dinner, "Ain't you to meet a man"
And Mama says, "It don't hurt to find a good one if you can"
Oh, they can't help their preachin'
And they can't stop the reachin' for all the livin' that I ain't done
Got my own road to run
I got my own road to run, yeah

I got dreams and I don't really wanna put 'em down
That boy can't see past the edges of this town
And I'm not hangin' around

'Cause Daddy says at dinner, "Ain't you to meet a man"
And Mama says, "It don't hurt to find a good one if you can"
Oh, they can't help their preachin'
They can't stop the reachin' for all the livin' that I ain't done
Got my own road to run
I got my own road to run, yeah

I know the truth is that they're usually right, but
I gotta point this steering wheel my own way
Tonight 'cause

Daddy says at dinner, "Ain't you to meet a man"
And Mama says, "It don't hurt to find a good one if you can"
Oh, they can't help their preachin'
They can't stop my reachin' for all the livin' I ain't done
Got my own road to run
I got my own road
I got my own road to run
I got my own road to run, yeah

// Roy Rogers //

Sometimes you dream, sometimes it seems
There's nothing there at all
You just seem older than yesterday
And you're waiting for tomorrow to call
So, you draw to the curtains and one thing's for certain
You're cozy in your little room
The carpet's all paid for, God bless the TV
Let's go shoot a hole in the moon

Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
Oh, the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains
Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range
Turn on the TV, shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight

Nine o'clock mornings, and five o'clock evenings
I'd liven up the pace if I could
Oh, I'd rather have a ham on my sandwich than cheese
But complaining wouldn't do you no good
So I laid my chair, close my eyes and think clear
I can hear hoof-beats ahead
'Cause Roy and Trigger have just hit the hilltop
And everyone else is in bed

Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
Oh, the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains
Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range
So turn on the TV, and shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Tonight

Turn on the TV, and shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight

// See You Again //

I got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were something special when you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

I've got a way of knowing when something is right
I feel like I must have known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection when you looked in my eyes
Now I can't wait to see you again

The last time I freaked out, I just kept looking down
I st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said "Oh she's just being Miley"

The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself, my heart can rest till then
I, I can't wait to see you again

I've got this crazy feeling deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader but I'm reading the signs
That you can't wait to see me again

The last time I freaked out, I just kept looking down
I st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said "Oh she's just being Miley"

The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself, my heart can rest till then
I, I can't wait to see you again

I've got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim

The last time I freaked out, I just kept looking down
I st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about
Felt like I couldn't breathe, you asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Leslie said "Oh she's just being Miley"

The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself, my heart can rest till then
I, I can't wait to see you again

// Trailer Song //

You say that youâre watching the birds out the window
Well Iâve got a bird you can watch
You ainât gotta act like youâre borrowing eggs
Just to see if my dishes are washed
Whatâs it to you if itâs Wednesday at noon
And Iâve traded my iced tea for scotch

Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ainât friends weâre just neighbors
Nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer

You ainât gotta ask what I did to my hair
Or whose underwearâs on the line
It ainât mine
I ainât gonna ask who's been mowing your grass
So you ainât gotta ask who mows mine
Quit judging my job and my car and my clothes
Get your nose out of your mini-blinds

Keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ainât friends weâre just neighbors
There ainât nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer

Donât ask me if I go to church
I wonât ask if your husband is still out of work
Try and claim high society
We get our mail on the same side of the street

So keep your two cents on your side of the fence
Girl we ainât friends weâre just neighbors
There ainât nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer
You nosy bitch
There ainât nothing to see here
Go back to your trailer

// Undermine //

Sometimes good intentions 
Don't come across so well
Got me analyzing everything that ain't worth thinking bout

Just 'cause I ain't lived through
The same hand that was dealt to you
Doesn't make me any less or make any more of you

I wouldn't trade my best day
So you could validate
All your fears
And if I've only got one shot
Won't waste it on a shadow box
I'll stand right here

'Cause it's all talk talk talk
Talking in the wind
It only slows you down when you start listening
And it's a whole lot harder to shine
Than undermine
Yeah, undermine

First mile is always harder
When you're leaving what you know
Won't blame me if you stay here waving to me as I go

I always wish the best for you
Hoped that you would see me through
My wildest dreams
Yeah, the ones you thought I'd never make

Still, you would trade your best day
Just to have your way
All these years
But if you only had one shot
Maybe all this talk
Would disappear

'Cause it's all talk talk talk
Talking in the wind
It only slows you down when you start listening
And it's a whole lot harder to shine
Than undermine
Yeah, undermine

'Cause it's all talk talk talk
Talking in the wind
It only slows you down when you start listening
And it's a whole lot harder to shine
Than undermine
Yeah, undermine

Sometimes good intentions
Don't come across so well

// Wonderfilled (Oreo) //

Wonder if I, gave an Oreo, to this cute guy that I used to know.
Would he have dumped his girlfriend? Typed that email and hit send. 
Would it not have ended like it did? Would we now have kids?
Oh, I don't know, whenever I taste one, I still think we will.
'Cause life is wonderfilled.
