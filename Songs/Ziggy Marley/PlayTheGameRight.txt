// Play The Game Right //

Yes, we've got to play this game right
In this game of life no one wants to lose
Heh, heh, heh

What you got
Let me tell you what you got
You got to choose it
Give a little, give a little more

Spa baba dey, spa baba dey, spa baba dey
Play the game right
Spa baba dey, spa baba dey, spa baba dey
We're playin' for our life

Life is life, and day to day
We got to live our lives to the fullest
We got to play the game right
No more mistakes, my friends
This time we're playin' for no trophy
We're playin' for our life, we're playin' for our life

Spa baba dey, spa baba dey, spa baba dey
Play the game right
Spa baba dey, spa baba dey, spa baba dey
We're playin' for our life

In life there's lots of visions
Oh, visions of reality
But there are certain people
Trying to bring us indignity
They say we lose some, we win some
But now we're gonna gain victory, yeh

Spa baba dey, spa baba dey, spa baba dey
Play the game right
Spa baba dey, spa baba dey, spa baba dey
We're playin' for our life

We all know we what we got in life, you know
We all know what we aimin' for
So treat your future right now, you know
Or you ain't gonna have no future
So dig it

Due to the great separation
That we the black people have seen
And the leaders great miscalculation
What all the people need, hey
We can't afford to lose the game, now, now
We're playing for our life, so stand up for your right

Spa baba dey, spa baba dey, spa baba dey
Play the game right
Spa baba dey, spa baba dey, spa baba dey
We're playin' for our life

Spa baba dey, spa baba dey, spa baba dey
Play the game right
Spa baba dey, spa baba dey, spa baba dey
We're playin' for our life

Spa baba dey, spa baba dey, spa baba dey
Play the game right
Spa baba dey, spa baba dey, spa baba dey
We're playin' for our life

Spa baba dey, spa baba dey, spa baba dey
Give a little, give a little more
Spa baba dey, spa baba dey, spa baba dey
Give a little more for the children

Spa baba dey, spa baba dey, spa baba dey
Give a little, give a little, give a little more
Spa baba dey, spa baba dey, spa baba dey
Give a little more for the children

Spa baba dey, spa baba dey, spa baba dey
Give a little, give a little more

// Reggae Is Now //

Reggae is now
Reggae's got a feeling
Reggae is now
Reggae's got a meaning

You think reggae will be reggae, yeah
Tough reggae we're doin' okay, yeah
More reggae is good reggae
Rock reggae man you're doin' okay yeah

Running through the woods of Africa yeah
The lies are demolished?
Running through the woods of Ethiopia
The lies are demolished?

Can the boys do it, then the girls do it too
So mister big man why can't you

Can the boys do it, then the girls do it too
So mister big man why can't you
