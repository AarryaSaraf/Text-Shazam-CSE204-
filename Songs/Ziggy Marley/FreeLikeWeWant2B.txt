// Power To Move Ya //

I got the power to move ya
I got the power to move ya
I got the power to move ya
Jah got the power to move ya

Don't take it simple
Babylon get trample
Them could a big and bad
Have you ever seen love mad
Is not a big ak
Is not a nuclear bomb
The system try to stop the power
No way they can
I got the power to move you

I got the power to move ya
Jah got the power to move ya
Now I say things happen just like that
When music play who knows what step will drop
Can you feel if it's creeping up on you
It's gonna get you before you know what to do
Turn you inside out
Make you scream and shout
The vibe is building
Crazy reggae rhythm

I got the power to move you
I got the power to move ya
Jah got the power to move ya
Jah got the power to move ya

So don't you try to stop
What you feel inside
When we hit that spot
We tell ya world collide
Some people try to stick
To what they know outside
Acting like a programmed chip
We tell them free they mind

I got the power to move you
I got the power to move ya
Jah got the power to move ya
Jah got the power to move ya

// Free Like We Want 2 B //

Free like we want to be
Some time you want to get off

But the boss man say you gonna lose you pay
No chain on your feet now
9 to 5 got you beat now
You working hard to save
Inflation like a tidal wave

Are we free like we want to be
Tell me are we free like we want to be
Are we free like we want to be
Tell me are we free like we want to be

Racist get defeat
Black man vote and take you seat
Now them think we gonna quiet
Maybe we start a riot
What happen to the diamond they stole
The innocent blood run cold
Do we still have to live in poverty
Now they say we're free to be poor
But are we free like we want to be
Black man are we free like we want to be

Tell me are we free like want to be
Are you free are you free
Kept in emotion
Will cause an explosion
Let your love go
Let me know
Some people expect
That's not what them get
Become no slave
Of them evil and wicked ways

Are we free like we want to be
Are we free like we want to be
Are you free like you want to be
Are we free like we want to be

Can't walk the streets late at night
Without fear of parasite
Everyone has a inborn right
A inborn right to live
Who gave us the reason to fight
By promoting negative vibes
Who taught us of drugs and crime
Now they say we're free to homicide
Committing genocide
We freely homicide committing genocide

Man we free like we want to be
Black man we free like we want to be
Tell me we free like we want to be
Are you free like you want to be
We want to be free
Free like we want to be

// Water And Oil //

Dem try fi hold hold wha dem can't conquer
Rastaman no mix up with no vagavanga
...

They want to condemn the innocent
For crimes which we did not committ
They want to get good people mix up
In their bag of tricks

But water and oil can't mix
Water and oil don't mix
...

Say dem try fi hold hold wha dem can't conquer
Rastaman no mix up with no vagavanga
...

Hear this! Naah go like the son if you no like the father
True we manifest under the same order
Cock your ears and listen me want you hear ya part ya
But first come in papa Ziggy as the eldest brother
Yes I hear the lies they've told
Dem says Rasta did this and this
What is the politician role
Is it to create conflicts

But water and oil can't mix
Water and oil don't mix
...

Jah who I praise break your silence
Now that the wicked is accusing
Attacking for no reason
All we did was pray for them
Now the way things happen fast
Some things me naah go member
But the day did cool cool and collective lya
Nest thing me know some unwanted visitors
Some devil worshipping Rasta hating cold-blooded murdera
Never get get wha dem expect dem expect lamb fi slaughter

Hear this! This is Ragamuffin and him hitting harder
We get up from weh we sit down to a strategic corner
Me and the bwoy dem eye mek four me mek a nervous swallow
Prip around from left to right me look pon all me brother
Hold me head to the sky and make a final prayer
Zoom! zoom! And everything take cover
Look how fast lightning rod back out in all a dem face
Quick! Me back out me no member wha it name
Them enver know the youth them would not lose them faith
Through the grace of the Father everything set straight
Water and oil can't mix

// Live It Up //

If life means what it means to me
Happiness come from the way we live
Not the money we receive
'Cause even the poor man is rich
Love in our hearts
Health strength and longevity

Live it up
Live it up don't give it up
...

If right means what it means to me
Before words were spoken
Jah law was written within
If right means what it means to you
What the preacher say is not what the preach do

Live it up
Live it up don't give it up
...

Life for me
Life for you life for me
Life for you
...

There is no owner's manual for the life that we lead
Learn as you grow
More power to you
In life there's many stages but don't you quit
'Cause when the table turn more power to you
More power to you
Good now
Everyone feeling
Good now
...

Living
Giving
Sharing
Loving
Living
Giving
Sharing
Loving
Live it up
Live it up
Don't give it up

// Tipsy Dazy //

Miss Tipsy Dazy you're topsy turvy
Say one minute everything seem fine
Tipsy Dazy you're topsy turvy
The next minute we're in a puss and dog fight
That's not really right

Seems as the day grow old
Our love grow cold
Remember you been told
Love can't be bought nor sold

Tipsy Dazy you're topsy turvy
Say one minute everything's just right dynamite
Tipsy Dazy you're topsy turvy
Next minute we're in this great big fight
That ain't my style of life

When everything seem secure
I can't just be too sure
'Cause you can wake up one day
Not in love any more
Hey! Remember you've been told
Love can't be bought nor sold
Seems as the days grow old
Our love grow cold

Tipsy Dazy topsy turvy saying
One minute everything seem right
Tipsy Dazy you're topsy turvy
Next minute we're in this great big fight
That's not really right
Once more can't say you never been told
Love can't be bought or sold

But it seems as them days grow
Our heat grow cold
Tipsy Dazy your're topsy turvy
One minute everything just fine really divine
Tipsy Dazy you're really turvy
Next next minute next minute next minute yea
Tipsy, Tipsy Dazy topsy, really turvy
One minute we're in a great big fight

// Bygones //

Naah laugh it off, can't laugh it off
We can't let bygones be bygones anymore
For this time we naah laugh it off
Tell we when you're ready and we'll come settle the score

But this time we naah laugh at all
A prudent man he seeketh knowledge
I'm saying though
Only a fool lean up on his folly
The wicked heart knows pure bitterness
I'm saying though never get a righteous man vex
Oh we've let bygones be bygones before
But this time we naah laugh it off
We won't let bygones be bygones anymore
For time time we naah laugh at all
This time we naah laugh it off
We can't let bygones be bygones
Oh this time we naah laugh it off
Oh we've let bygones be bygones before

But this time we naah laugh at all
A prudent man he seeketh knowledge
I tell you this
Only the fool lean up on the folly
The wicked heart knows pure bitterness
I tell you this never get a righteous man vex
We've let bygones be bygones before
This time we naah laugh it off
We can't let bygones be bygones anymore
But this time we naah laugh at all
Say this time me naah laugh it off

Me say me naah get enough good weh day
All thema work is like them naah get no pay
Naah get enough food from weh day
All the work we work is like we naah get no pay

But in a corner we wings and a jam
Ragga ragga a watch the notion
Say we naah get no good food from weh day
Naah sow no good seed from weh day

Bass man a cry bout him can't get string
Have the contacts and can't bring them in raggamuffin dj and sing

All the talk we talk is like we naah Lord
Naah get no good yood from weh day
All the bawl we bawl say them no hear wha we a say

// G7 //

Seven richest countries in the world
Them have a little meeting
Them a plan to keep and oppress the poor
So them have a little meeting
But when them think then thing goes another way
Yes when them think then thing goes another way

Did you hear about these meetings
No you won't find poor countries there
Because of capitalist greed
Revolution seem to be the only way
It may be an old fashion way of thinking
But I believe in the people and these aims

'Cause when them think then things go the people way
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh
When them think then things go the the people way
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh

These countries want to stay on top
So they'll find any way
To them third world people life is but a small price to be paid
They think they're great feeling no one can touch them
Well them have a next thing comin'

'Cause when them think then things go the people way
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh
Oh when them think then thing goes another way
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh

Seven richest things in the world
What do they do for the people
Look at America the so-called best
How many homeless
Where the money went
In the sky on weapons of death
Why don't they write the needy some more checks

'Cause when them think then thing goes another way
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh
When them think then things go the the people way
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh

// Beautiful Mother Nature //

Beautiful Mother Nature
She looked at me with a smile on her face
Then she started to cry
She said why did my children forsake me

She felt like she was dying
Oh ungrateful children
When she was young she was beautiful and strong
The more children she had the more things went wrong
Now she's feeling old and cold
And her heart doesn't feel love anymore

Beautiful Mother Nature
She sat me down and told me to sing her a song
Maybe it would make her feel better
Maybe her children would sing along

And see the wrong we have done
Make amends to mend her heart
She still wouldn't hate none of her children
No matter what cruel things they've done
She'll always be there when her babies are crying
She's a mother a mother you can depend on

Beautiful Mother Nature
She's hoping her children will love her again
Like once she remember
Before skyscrapers and chemical plants
When she was all that we had
Before they polluted her sacred land
Now her tears are falling like acid rain
And her voice sounds like earthquake

I had to beg her Mother please don't leave
Give another chance I'll talk to the kids
Beautiful Mother Nature
She was my
Beautiful Mother Nature
Still is my
Beautiful Mother Nature
She is my
Beautiful Mother Nature
Still is my
