Album: Traveller

// Traveller //

I see the sunrise creeping in
Everything changes like the desert wind
Here she comes and then sheâs gone again

[Chorus:]
Iâm just a traveller on this earth
Sure as my heartâs behind the pocket of my shirt
Iâll just keep rolling till Iâm in the dirt
âCause Iâm a traveller, oh, Iâm a traveller
I couldnât tell you honey, I donât know
Where Iâm going but Iâve got to go
âCause every turn reveals some other road
And Iâm a traveller, oh, Iâm a traveller

My heartbeatâs rhythm is a lonesome sound
Just like the rubber turning on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound

[Chorus]

When Iâm gone
Somebody else will have to feel this wrong
Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along
Sing along

[Chorus]

// Fire Away //

Honey load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend Iâm a shelter for heartaches that donât have a home
Choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that Iâll say is

[Chorus:]
Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, Iâm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

Well, I wish I could say
That Iâve never been here before
But you know and I know
That Iâll always come back for more
Your love might be my damnation
But Iâll cry to my grave

[Chorus x2]

// Tennessee Whiskey //

Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I'd known
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of the bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

[Instrumental]

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey
Tennessee whiskey

// Parachute //

Street lights along the highway
Throwing shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turning
To the rhythm of a broken heart

You only need a roof when it's raining
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute

There's a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say

You only need a roof when it's raining
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute

If you think you're going down
Just know I will be around

You only need a roof when it's raining
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying till you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute

// Whiskey And You //

Thereâs a bottle on the dresser by your ring
And itâs empty so right now I donât feel a thing
And Iâll be hurting when I wake up on the floor
But Iâll be over it by noon
Thatâs the difference between whiskey and you
Come tomorrow, I can walk in any store
It ainât a problem, theyâll always sell me more
But your forgiveness
Well, thatâs something I canât buy
There ainât a thing that I can do
Thatâs the difference between whiskey and you

[Chorus:]
Oneâs the devil, one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder if they ainât both the same
But oneâs a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
And oneâs the long gone bitter truth
Thatâs the difference between whiskey and you

Iâve got a problem but it ainât like what you think
I drink because Iâm lonesome and Iâm lonesome âcause I drink
But if I donât break down and bring it on myself
Itâll hit out of the blue
Thatâs the difference between whiskey and you

[Chorus]

Ah, thatâs the difference between whiskey and you

// Nobody To Blame //

She took down the photograph
Of our wedding day
Ripped it down the middle
And threw my half away
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
She broke all my fishing rods
Put my guns in hock
Threw my clothes out in the yard
And changed out all the locks
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Chorus:]
I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

She fired up my old hot rod
Ran it in the pond
Put sugar in my John Deere
I canât even mow my lawn
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
She built her a bonfire
With my old six string
Took all my good whiskey
And poured it down the drain
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Chorus]

// More Of You //

When I think of you and the first time we met
And I heard the sound of your sweet gentle voice
My heart took me over and gave me no choice
And right then I knew

[Chorus:]
It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
Till you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

When I look at you now that years have gone by
I think of the memories that time can't erase
And all of the smiles that you've brought to my face
Your love's been so true

[Chorus]

When I leave this earth you'll be holding my hand
And it gives me comfort to know you'll be there
And I'll thank the Lord for the love that we share
You're heaven to me

[Chorus]

Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

// When The Stars Come Out //

I was looking for a change of scene
You were looking at a magazine
It was red carpets and limousines
And the grass seemed so much greener
All we wanted was to get there fast
So, we packed up everything we had
Running on hope and a tank of gas
Like dreams ainât just for dreamers
We couldnât wait to leave that life behind
Trying to find salvation in that city limit sign

[Chorus:]
And one of those LA nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out and shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out

Everybodyâs, somebody, someday
Everybodyâs got a part to play
Everybodyâs trying to find a way
To say, what needs saying
Everybodyâs got a friend of a friend
Somebody that can get you in
Begging angels for a sin
In a game that weâre all playing
You and I, weâre gamblers holding cards that we canât see
And Iâm betting on you, youâre betting on me

[Chorus]

Down on the freeway, the sun is out of sight
And I got a feeling tonight might be the night
Yeah, tonight might be the night

[Chorus]

// Daddy Doesn't Pray Anymore //

[Chorus:]
Daddy doesnât pray anymore
I guess heâs finished talking to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesnât pray anymore

I remember even when the times were bad
He thanked Jesus for everything he had
For a good wife and three children
And the food upon our plates
Yeah, everything was right when he said, grace

[Chorus]

There was a time when we didnât get along
Cause I thought I was right and he was wrong
Still when I laid down at night
Iâd hear him get down on his knees
And say a little prayer for me

[Chorus]

Today I followed daddy down to church
And listened to the preacher read Godâs word
We sang his favorite hymn but daddy didnât make a sound
This afternoon weâll lay him in the ground
But daddy doesnât pray anymore
I guess heâs finally walking with the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesnât pray anymore

// Might As Well Get Stoned //

Well, she said, she didnât love me
And kicked me out the door
Now Iâm livinâ in one room
And sleepinâ on the floor
Think Iâm gonna kick my boots off
And put some music on
And since Iâm all alone
I might as well get stoned

[Chorus:]
I might as well get stoned
Get it off my mind
Ainât got a thing to do
All Iâve got is time
The bottleâs all Iâve had to be a friend of mine
And since my whiskeyâs gone
I might as well get stoned

Now every time I watch the TV
Another soldier dies
Another brotherâs gone
Another mother cries
Now I know theyâve got a job to do
But if I had one wish
I wish theyâd all come home
So, we could all get stoned

[Chorus]

// Was It 26 //

Livin' hard was easy when I was young and bullet-proof
I had no chains to bind me, just a guitar and a roof
Emptied every bottle, when I poured I never missed
I had blood shot eyes at twenty-five or was it twenty-six
Didn't seem to matter what price I had to pay
Cause anything worth havin', Iâd just lose anyway
Friends worried about me theyâd asked if I was sick
Thought I wouldnât die at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

[Chorus:]
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Melted into memories like somebody else's life
Iâm glad to say, Iâve come around
But if I could have one wish
Iâd like another try at twenty-five
Or was it twenty-six

Met a girl from Georgia, smart and pretty, college grad
I thought my luck was changin' but then it all went bad
I guess I fell in love with her all it took was just one kiss
But then she said goodbye at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

[Chorus]

I've been down that road before almost as far as hell
Deception or redemption, I guess only time will tell
I have faith and the knowledge that God gave us a gift
I couldn't hide at twenty-five or was it twenty-six

[Chorus]

// The Devil Named Music //

We drove all night to Billings, Montana
Flew into Utah, slept there all day
I canât remember stopping in Denver
Yeah, I live my illusion that somebody needs me to play

Sometimes Iâm drunk
Sometimes Iâm stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

Now I sold my soul a long time ago
I put it in a six string and a sad melody
And Iâm sometimes a winner, most times a loser
If the crowd gets into it, itâll all feel the same way to me

Sometimes Iâm drunk
Sometimes Iâm stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my daughter
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

Sometimes Iâm drunk
Sometimes Iâm stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my son
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

Sometimes Iâm drunk
Sometimes Iâm stoned
And yes, I get tired of being alone
I miss my daughter
I miss my wife
But the devil named music is taking my life

// Outlaw State Of Mind //

Cut my teeth on Daddy's old LGO
And I lost my mind somewhere in New Mexico
And TW put a snake on my back
I keep a red bone on my side

And there's people all across the land
From East Kentucky down to Alabam
Hold on like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind

I got friends that know how to have a good time
Yeah they roll their own and drink Carolina shine
I've seen the devil in a dark coal mine
I've been higher than a Georgia pine

And there's people all across the land
From West Virginia to the Rio Grande
Hold on like I am all the time 
In an outlaw state of mind

And there's people all across the land
From New York out to old San Fran
Just don't give a damn all the time
In an outlaw state of mind

// Sometimes I Cry //

There are days that I can walk around like I'm alright,
And I pretend to wear a smile on my face,
And I could keep the pain from comin' out of my eyes,
But sometimes, sometimes,

Sometimes I cry,
Cry,
Sometimes I cry,
When I can't do nothing else.

Everybody keeps tellin' me to move on,
Oh but I can't seem to go anywhere without you,
Cause ever since, and every single night you been gone,
Sometimes, sometimes,

Sometimes I cry,
Cry,
Sometimes I cry,
When I can't do nothing else

Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry
When I can't do nothing else.
