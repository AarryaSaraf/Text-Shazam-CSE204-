Album: Odessa

// Odessa //

14th of February, 1899
The British ship Veronica was lost without a sign
Baa baa black sheep you haven't any wool
Captain Richardson left himself a lonely wife in Hull

Cherub, I lost a ship in the Baltic sea
I'm on an iceberg running free
Sitting, filing this berg to the shape of a ship
Sailing my way back to your lips

One passing ship gave word that
You have moved out of your old flat
You love the Vicar more than words can say
Tell him to pray that I won't melt away
And I'll see your face again

Odessa, how strong am I?
Odessa, how time goes by

Treasure, you know the neighbors that live next door
They haven't got their dog anymore
Freezing, sailing around in the North Atlantic
Can't seem to leave the sea anymore

I just can't understand why you just moved to Finland
You love that Vicar more than words can say
Ask him to pray that I won't melt away
And I'll see your face again

Odessa, how strong am I?
Odessa, how time goes by

14th of February, 1899

// You'll Never See My Face Again //

Every single word has been spoken
It's much too late to change the ways
Far too many vows have been broken
You can't expect a soul to stay

You think that you can stand and lie?
It makes me laugh, you've got no friends
It took a thousand years to find out why
You'll never see my face again

You know that you've been left before this night
It's come my turn to make it over
I wish that every thing was colored white
I wish that I could be a rover

You think that you can stand and lie?
It makes me laugh, you've got no friends
It took a thousand years to find out why
You'll never see my face again

Every single word has been spoken
It's much too late to change the ways
Far too many vows have been broken
You can't expect a soul to stay

You think that you can tell me lies?
It makes me laugh, you've got no friends
It took a thousand years to find out why
You'll never see my face again

You'll never see my face again
You'll never see my face again
You'll never see my face again
You'll never see my face again

// Black Diamond //

Where are you? I love you
Where are you? I love you
Where are you to keep me warm?

I had a dream of a place far away
I followed a river where the dead man would play
And I'm leaving in the morning
And I'm leaving in the morning

And I won't die, so don't cry, I'll be home
Those big black diamonds that lie there for me
By the tall white mountains which lie by the sea

I knew a man, who was tall as the sky
Followed a river where thousands had died
And he was leaving in the morning
Oh no, he was leaving in the morning

Said, if I come home and my woman has flown
Oh, big black diamonds that lie there for me
By the tall white mountains which lie by the sea

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Say goodbye to auld lang syne
Say goodbye to auld lang syne
Say goodbye to auld lang syne

// Marley Purt Drive //

Sunday morning, woke up yawning
Filled the pool for a swim
Pulled down the head and looked in the glass
Just to see if I was in
Went up the stairs and kissed my woman
To make her come alive
'Cause with fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I gotta go for a Sunday drive
Fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I gotta go for a Sunday drive

That's how they are, so I grabbed out the car
Convertible fifty-nine
Headed to the freeway
Tried to find the Pasadena sign
Ten miles and three quarters
I wasn't feeling any more alive
'Cause with fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I gotta go for a Sunday drive
Fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I gotta go for a Sunday drive

I used to be a minstrel free
With a whole lot of bread in my bag
I used to feel that my life was real
But the good Lord threw me a snag
Now I'm gonna be the same as me
No matter how I try
'Cause with fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I gotta go for a Sunday drive
Fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I gotta go for a Sunday drive

Turned 'round the car and headed for home
I guess I realized my fate
Ten miles and three quarters more
I pulled up outside the gate
Twenty more kids were stood inside
And that made thirty-five
'Cause with an orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I gotta go for a Sunday drive
An orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I gotta go for a Sunday drive

Sunday morning, woke up yawning
Filled the pool for a swim
Pulled down the glass and looked in the mirror
Just to see if I was in
Went up the stairs and kissed my woman
To make her come alive
'Cause with an orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I gotta go for a Sunday drive
An orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I gotta go for a Sunday drive

// Edison //

He made electric lights to read
He gave us light today
He gave us cylinders to please
When Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay

Edison set the world on fire
He really made their day
Station to station, many wires
Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay

Oh, how, look at us now
We've still got a lot to learn
But it's someone else's turn
Edison's here to stay
Edison's here to stay

All of the world can taste his glory
All of the people say
"You'll be the man to write his story"
Edison's here to stay
Edison's here to stay

Oh, how, look at us now
We've still got a lot to learn
But it's someone else's turn
Edison's here to stay
Edison's here to stay

He made electric lights to read
He gave us light today
He gave us cylinders to please
When Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay

You'll be the man to write his story
Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay

All of the world can hear his story
Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay
Edison came to stay

// Melody Fair //

Who is the girl with the crying face
Looking at millions of signs?
She knows that life is a running race
Her face shouldn't show any sign

Melody fair, won't you comb your hair?
You can be beautiful, too
Melody fair, remember you're only a woman
Melody fair, remember you're only a girl

Who is the girl at the window pane
Watching the rain falling down?
Melody, life isn't like the rain
It's just like a merry go round

Melody fair, won't you comb your hair?
You can be beautiful, too
Melody fair, remember you're only a woman
Melody fair, remember you're only a girl

Who is the girl with the crying face
Looking at millions of signs?
She knows that life is a running race
Her face shouldn't show any sign

Melody fair, won't you comb your hair?
You can be beautiful, too
Melody fair, remember you're only a woman
Melody fair, remember you're only a girl

// Suddenly //

How can you tell by looking at me?
How can you tell you like what you see?
Suddenly, there's a boy in the rain alone
Suddenly, there's a girl in the rain alone

Oh yeah, how can you tell humans are real?
How can you tell you like what you feel?
Suddenly, there's a girl in your heart, oh boy
Suddenly, there's a boy in your heart, oh boy

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Yeah, how can you tell by looking at me?
How can you tell you like what you see?
Suddenly, there's a boy in the rain alone
Suddenly, there's a girl in the rain alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

// Whisper Whisper //

Whisper, whisper, what have you got?
I've got something that you need a lot
Stop me and buy one
You can see better, but you better not

Listen, mister. Can you help me?
It's my sister. Show her how to fly
Stop me and try one
You can see everything blowing by

Whisper, whisper, keep it quiet
If you like it you can try it too
Stop me and buy one
I am illegal. That means so are you

Whisper, whisper, what have you got?
I've got something that you need a lot
Stop me and buy one
You can see better, but you better not

Whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper
Whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper

I am man and you are woman
Who needs marriage? We are humans all
If I could please you, arouse and ease you
Then it would please you if I should call

Doesn't matter what your name is
I can do a million things to you
No explanations, sexual patience
Most of the nation's doing it too

No, no, no
No, no

// Lamplight //

Allons, viens encore, chÃ©rie
J'attendrai patiemment sous la lampe dans la vieille avenue

Then I may end
She had things to buy
I close my eyes
Yet I don't know why
I gave her money; said she knew someone
And she said she won't be long

Lamplight keep on burning while this heart of mine is yearning
Lamplight keep on burning 'til this love of yours is mine

I sat alone with my thoughts and laughed
Then saw your face in an old photograph
I didn't think that I could live without you but what am I to do?

Lamplight keep on burning while this heart of mine is yearning
Lamplight keep on burning 'til this love of yours is mine

Come home again dear. I have waited year after year
Under the lamp in our old avenue
If all in the world that's laughing, why should it make us cry?

// Sound Of Love //

See the children play the ball
See them play along the hall
It makes me cry to see them smile
I see the moon, I see the sky
I see reflections in my eyes
And there's no one to share my life

I need a life to go my way
So every night, I pray
Just give me someone for my life

I feel a clown
People try to play me down
And there's one thing I never found
The sound of love

See the old man walk the lane
See him walk along in pain
It makes me cry to see them smile
I watch the moon, I watch the sky
I see reflections in my eyes
And there's no one to share my life

I need a life to go my way
So every night, I pray
Just give me someone for my life

I feel a clown
People try to play me down
And there's one thing I never found
The sound of love

The sound of love
Everybody loves the sound of love
Everybody loves the sound of love
Everybody loves the sound of love
Everybody loves the sound of love, love
Everybody loves the sound of love
Everybody needs the sound of love

// Give Your Best //

It's a square dance, Mr. Marshall
It's a square dance on the floor
It's a square dance, Mr. Perkins
It's a square dance to be sure, to be sure
This is Raleigh! Grab partners

I'm just a clown that used to run around
I used to have a million friends
I used to start where everybody ends
But I just give my best to my friends

I've done my shows, everybody knows
I nearly sold all my clothes
One man can give, another has to lend
So I just give my best to my friends
(And so you should)

And when you think that your life isn't right
You know the day isn't always like night
You've had your peace, now it's time for you to fight
Just give your best to your friends

I'm just a clown that used to run around
I used to have a million friends
I used to start where everybody ends
So I just give my best to my friends

And when you think that your life isn't right
You know the day isn't always like night
You've had your peace, now it's time for you to fight
Just give your best to your friends

And when you think that your life isn't right
You know the day isn't always like night
You've had your peace, now it's time for you to fight
Just give your best to your friends
And just give your best to your friends

// I Laugh In Your Face //

The circus is coming to see you
The elephant smiles
Everybody can hear you
Say that's out of style

My brother is friendly for reasons
If I am the same
Just for four hundred seasons
We all live in rain

So I laugh in your face
You're only one race
Yes, I laugh in your face
And I'm right
You lie just like the rest
But there's nobody best
So I laugh in your face
And I'm right

I'll pull out your plugs, so you're small
You'll slide down the drain
On the steps of St. Peter's
You all look the same

So I laugh in your face
You're only one race
Yes, I laugh in your face
And I'm right
You lie just like the rest
But there's nobody best
So I laugh in your face
And I'm right

The circus is coming to see you
The elephant smiles
Everybody can hear you
Say that's out of style

So I laugh in your face
You're only one race
Yes, I laugh in your face
And I'm right
You lie just like the rest
But there's nobody best
So I laugh in your face
And I'm right

// Never Say Never Again //

Your lips could never show a smile
You never tried, you just put me in a file
I never lived inside your hole, child
I thought you needed me, I never had no style

Never say, never say never again
Never say, never say never again
You said goodbye, I declared war on Spain
Never say, never say never again

Your eyes could never show a grin
You never tried, you just put me in a tin
I never lived inside your hole, child
You know I needed you, a-look at the shape I'm in

Never say, never say never again
Never say, never say never again
You said goodbye, I declared war on Spain
Never say, never say never again

Your lips could never show a smile
You never tried, you just put me in a file
I never lived inside your hole, child
I thought you needed me, I never had no style

Never say, never say never again
Never say, never say never again
You said goodbye, I declared war on Spain
Never say, never say never again

Never say, never say never again
Never say, never say never again
You said goodbye, I declared war on Spain
Never say, never say never again

Never, never
Never, never
Never, never

// First Of May //

When I was small and Christmas trees were tall
We used to love while others used to play
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by
Some one else moved in from far away

Now we are tall and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die
But guess we'll cry come first of May

The apple tree that grew for you and me
I watched the apples falling, one by one
And I recall the moment of them all
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine

Now we are tall and Christmas trees are small
And you don't ask the time of day
But you and I, our love will never die
But guess we'll cry come first of May

When I was small and Christmas trees were tall
Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by
Some one else moved in from far away
