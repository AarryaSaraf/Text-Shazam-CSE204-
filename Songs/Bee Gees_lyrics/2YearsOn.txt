Album: 2YearsOn

// 2 Years On //

One year, two years, time goes by
People laugh and people cry

Every morning the clock strikes eight
I go to work, I close the gate
And on my way, I sing a song
About my wife, where I belong

If the clouds get together
And talk about the weather
If it's rain they anticipate
Baby, make no mistake
Yes, the storm will break
But never me you see

2 years on, 2 years on
But only you can see me
Only you can see me

For what I've got
Sir Lancelot was just a dream
And I am not
For I am he with something more
It's you and I reality

If the clouds get together
And talk about the weather
If it's rain they anticipate
Baby, make no mistake
Yes, the storm will break
But never me you see

2 years on, 2 years on
But only you can see me
Only you can see me

2 years on, 2 years on, ah

// Portrait Of Louise //

Summers come and summers go
But I need the rain
All your vines will overgrow
And winds will blow insane

But I'm not gonna move
And I won't make you cry
You can shelter in my home
And I won't ask you why

Friends will come and friends will go
But you stay on my train
All your wines will overflow
As winds will blow insane

But I'm not gonna move
And I won't make you cry
You can shelter in my home
And I won't ask you why

But I'm not gonna move
And I won't make you cry
You can shelter in my home
And I won't ask you why

You can shelter in my home
And I won't ask you why
You can shelter in my home
And I won't ask you why

// Man For All Seasons //

Everybody wants to leave
Just like you and I
I have all year to smile
A tear for every eye

Life closed its eyes
Broke my world, now I cry
I've got to tell you, I've got the reasons
'Cause I'm a man, a man for all seasons
Alive

And would I pray
What makes the world go 'round
I haven't got today
My mind is lost and found

Life closed its eyes and said goodbye
Now I cry
But I've got to tell you, I've got my reasons
'Cause I'm a man, a man for all seasons
Alive

And would I pray
What makes the world go 'round
I haven't got today
My mind is lost and found

Du du du du du du du

I'm a man for all seasons
I'm a man for all seasons
I'm a man for all seasons
I'm a man for all seasons

// Sincere Relation //

George was born somewhere
Inside London town
Working as he grew
For that extra pound
Respected by all
He married and made a home
To give his children
More than he had known

But then he died
Without an explanation
He never lied
A very sincere relation

Years before a fire
Sent him in the street
It took him months of work
To make ends meet

But then he died
Without an explanation
He never lied
A very sincere relation

// Back Home //

Took a plane to Cairo
Then a Cessna to Rome
I got hijacked to Tel Aviv
And it's the first time that I've flown

But I've found my Shangri-La
In a place that's not too far
Back home

Took a train to Jordan
And to Texas and back
I met Lyndon B. Johnson
And I felt his hand on my back

But I found my Shangri-La
In a place that's not too far
Back home

Back home, back home
Back home, back home
Back home, back home

// The 1st Mistake I Made //

I ain't got no claim to nothing
I don't mess with anyone
I walk my way living in a masquerade
And one day I looked behind me at all the things I've done
That's the 1st mistake I ever made

I was born to a lonely woman in a town called Buffalo
Never knew the man who never stayed
With my 12-string on my back I discovered every track
That's the 1st mistake I ever made

With a million hearts I've broken
I never kept the score
Memories of good love hate to stay
But I still remember someone who loved me so much more
That's the 1st mistake I ever made

So, when nothing's worth the living and in the night I look above
Prayed, about a million times I prayed
I know my story ended when I lost my only love
That's the 1st mistake I ever made

I was born to a lonely woman in a town called Buffalo
Never knew the man who never stayed
With my 12-string on my back I discovered every track
That's the 1st mistake I ever made

// Lonely Days //

Good morning, mister sunshine
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way

I see you every morning
Outside the restaurants
The music plays so nonchalant

Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?

Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?

Good morning, mister sunshine
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way

Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
(Lonely days, lonely nights)
Where would I be without my woman?
(Lonely days, lonely nights) Yeah, yeah
Lonely days, lonely nights
(Lonely days, lonely nights)
Where would I be without my woman?
(Lonely days, lonely nights)
Lonely days, lonely nights
(Lonely days, lonely nights)
Where would I be without my woman?
(Lonely days, lonely nights) Yeah, yeah
Lonely days, lonely nights

// Alone Again //

"Leaving". That's all you ever seem to say and I'm tired
The wants you have me for have expired
Sleeping and reading every book I can find to get my mind off
In all I was a soul you were using

I am alone again
You can't believe the tears that I've shed
I'm on a bound down train
Don't desert me now or I am dead

People, the sun is going down on your heads so read your paper
There's no one there for you to confide in
It's instinct to always to have a shoulder to cry on
And to rely on
Someone there to share and to shine on

I am alone again
You can't believe the tears that I've shed
I'm on a bound down train
Don't desert me now or I am dead

I am alone again
You can't believe the tears that I've shed
I'm on a bound down train
Don't desert me down or I am dead

I am alone again
You can't believe the tears that I've shed
I'm on a bound down train
Don't desert me down or I am dead

// Tell Me Why //

If you think that you can hurt me and make me cry
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
And if you think that you can hurt me with lies that cry
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why

Now I've got my reasons for feeling this way
Day after day and as nights go by

So, if you think my heart is broken and I might die
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why

All of the world is as lonely as me
Day after day and as nights go by

So if you think my heart is broken and I might die
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why

Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
