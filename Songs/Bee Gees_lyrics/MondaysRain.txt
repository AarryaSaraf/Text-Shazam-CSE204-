// Where Are You //

Where are you (where are you)
Night is day and day is night
Where are you (where are you)
Need you girl you're not in sight
Our love would grow, but you leave and I know
That you don't love me (where are you)
I need you girl, you're not in sight
I told you (I told you)
I was never coming back -ah
You told me (You told me)
You would give my love the sack -ah
Now as I fly, you won't tell me goodbye
'Cause you don't love me (where are you)

Now you give my love the sack -ah
Now as my heart lies in pieces of eight
You were a part of my love but too late
I love you (I love you)
This I think that you should know
I'll be blue (I'll be blue)
You are still 'cause I must
I'd like to stay but I know you won't play
And see things my way (where are you)
You are still 'cause I must go
You are still 'cause I must
I must go (where are you )

// Spicks And Specks //

Where is the sun
That shone on my head
The sun in my life
It is dead
It is dead

Where is the light
That would play
In my streets
And where are the friends
I could meet
I could meet

Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind

Where is the sun
That shone on my head
The sun in my life
It is dead
It is dead

Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind

Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind

Where is the girl I loved
All along
The girl that I loved
She's gone
She's gone

All of my life
I call yesterday
The spicks and the specks
Of my life've gone away
All of my life
I call yesterday
The spicks and the specks
Of my life've gone away

Everybody
Spicks and specks
Spicks and specks, yeah, ah
(Ah) spicks and specks
Spicks and specks

// Playdown //

I'm not a ghost, I am a man
I only do the best I can
Believing I will find a way
It's just a price that you must pay

All my friends, they put me down
So I go from town to town
They all say that I'm a clown
They play high and I play down
They play high and I play

I play the game, I see the light
I walk in day, you walk in night
Believe me boy, it ain't no good
In doing what you never should

All my friends, they put me down
So I go from town to town
They all say that I'm a clown
They play high and I play down
They play high and I play

All my friends, they put me down
So I go from town to town
They all say that I'm a clown
They play high and I play down
They play high and I play

// Big Chance //

People in their pride believe it's easier for them to leave
Their problems in the arms of others, running to their mothers
Lasting love is such a funny thing
When you're in love you're on the wings
You're not in love, it's good for you
'Cause you can do the things you like to do

It's you big chance, so take it baby
It's you big chance, you'll make it baby

When you're high and mighty you'll remember how I loved you
You'll be thinking how you hurt me when I needed you beside me
In the night is such a lonely time
I dream of you and that's a sign
It means that I am still a fool
And I am still so much in love with you

It's your big chance, so take it baby
It's your big chance, don't fake it baby

Big chance
Hot chance

// Glass House //

Glass house, that once was mine, the sun will shine in on me
You, change your mind, you weren't the kind to live on me
I remember yesterday, turn my tears to laugher
Then you left and like a stray, I came running after

I remember you at night, palm trees softly swaying
I remember all the words you were softly saying

Glass house upon the hill so big and still, the shady lane
It's ours, my love, until the day we say "Auf Wiedersehen"

// How Many Birds //

I was so lonely without you baby, don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm goin' crazy without you baby, look at what I'm goin' through
How many times must I tell you I love
Tell you I love you times before
Don't believe that I'm worth all your kisses
I'm worth more than this, but you ignore

How many birds will I see high and flying
How many birds will it take 'til I get you
I will be crying, yeah

Maybe tomorrow you'll come walkin' my way
Come talkin' my way, you'll find out
My love for you will be stronger than truer
I'll look at you and there's no doubt

How many birds will I see high and flying
How many birds will it take 'til I get you
I will be crying, yeah

I was so lonely without you baby, don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm going crazy without you baby, look at what I'm goin' through
Baby, baby, baby

// Second Hand People //

See the cracks upon the wall
We do not know the meaning of it all
Ain't no fire to warm my feet
Ain't got a nickel for a bit to eat
We're not workin', we're not slavin'
Ain't worth a brain, 'cause we're not worth savin'
Second hand people, tall as a steeple
Softer than treacle, in a pond are we
Second hand people

Ain't no mirror to comb my face
Just keep on going from place to place
Ain't got no lights above my head
Don't even bother to leave my bed
We're not livin', we're existin'
We're not movin', just resistin'
Second hand people, tall as a steeple
Softer than treacle, in a pond are we
Second hand people, tall as a steeple
Softer than treacle

// I Don't Know Why I Bother With Myself //

I'm a fool, I've taken no advice
And I'm so cruel, I'm talkin' to you nice
But then again you may not take me back
Oh just to put my hat back on your rack
Guess I don't know why I bother with myself
You will find a part of me in someone else
I never argued with the fact that she is mine
I only hurt her and kissed her three times out of nine
You have the edge to talk to men and make them feel at home
You spent that every lasting cent on someone that's not your own
Bear with me there's bound to be a chance
To heal the wound and start back our romance
I gained a heart and part of it is yours
Oh just to see my love walk through these doors
Oh and my life's bound out ahead, I can not look
And if you read me, then I am just a book
You don't care if rain falls in my room
You won't be there if trouble fills my spoon
I'm just a clown that plays around with misery in my way
Forgetting all the rules of love ....[fade]

// Monday's Rain //

I can see the sun shinin' down on me
Is it you my love that I can see
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me walk to Monday's rain (Monday's rain)
To Monday's rain (Monday's rain)

In this my life, I walk in light
You are my love so baby I'm all right
Don't let me down, baby
Don't let me down
Oh baby, please don't let me walk in Monday's rain (Monday's rain)
In Monday's rain (Monday's rain)

Ah

Ev'ry man alive has got to have someone
So what will I do when baby you are gone
Don't let me down
Don't walk on me
My Sunday sunshine
Hide Monday's rain (Monday's rain)
Hide Monday's rain (Monday's rain)
Monday's rain (Monday's rain) Ah

// Tint Of Blue //

A tint of blue, deep down inside my heart each time I see you
It would take a lot to ease my pain from all these chains

A tint of red, each time I see you with another
Just because I was your lover, jealous I
I get so angry I could cry

A tint of blue, why do you make me feel so sad
Why do you leave me feeling bad they way I do
A tint of blue

A tint of red, each time I see you with another
Just because I was your lover, jealous I
I get so angry I could cry

// Jingle Jangle //

Jingle jangle, my love wears silvery bangles
She likes to wander and that's why I'm under
The spell of her jingle jangle

We used to cry on each other's shoulder
Now that I'm older, she wanders ahead
Now that she's found love, I still hear the sound of
Silvery bangles, remain in my head

Jingle jangle, my love wears silvery bangles
She used to wander and that's why I'm under
The spell of her jingle jangle

Mm..... [fade]

// Born A Man //

When I was just a little boy, when I didn't know
My daddy put me on his knee and showed me the way to go
He said, "A woman will do her best to make a fool out of you
So be a man and stand the test and see what you can do."

I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man

If you got what it takes my boy
You can always choose
Work it out before it's too late my boy
Make sure you never lose

I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man

Born a man

Ev'ry woman wants her man to live and learn on her land
Where I go, baby you go
Arrangement, man and wife

I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man

Born a man
