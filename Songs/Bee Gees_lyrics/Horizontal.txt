// World //

Now, I found that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday

Living tomorrow
Where in the world will I be tomorrow?
How far am I able to see?
Or am I needed here?

Now, I have found that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday

If I remember all of the things I have done
I'd remember all of the times I've gone wrong
Why do they keep me here?

Now, I have found that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday
Now, I have found that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday
Now, I have found that the world is round
And of course it rains everyday

And now, I've found that the world is round

// And The Sun Will Shine //

And the rain will fall. It falls for you
And the clouds will break into tears
You should be here standing so near to me

'Cept I know you should be sad
But give me time alone to get it out of my mind
Though I say, I know it's only the weather
'Cause every time it rains, you are gone
And I'm blue
Then I wake up, then I wake up

And the sun will shine if just for you
And the trees will talk to the skies, whispering lies
Heaven will pass to me, yeah

Trains walk by, and the birds disappear
But why am I still here without you by my side?
So, I cry your name and love
'Cause love to me is life and I live
Then I wake up, then I grow up

And the rain will fall
It falls for you
And the clouds will break
It should be near
And the sun will shine
If just for you
And the love

// Lemons Never Forget //

Incidentally there should be some changes made
You've got to work if you should have to save
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget
You've got to play it cool before they come and throw the net

Wait a while and straighten out the tie you wear
You've got to take it easy if you dare
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget
You've got to play it cool before they come and throw the net

Don't be blind, you've got a thinking mind
Stop the bells that ring so loud
Don't nod your head, you'll draw a crowd
Just think of everything you've worked so hard to bring
The lemon sings my song. He's known it all along

Incidentally there should be some changes made
You've got to work if you should have to save
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget
You've got to play it cool before they come and throw the net

Don't be blind, you've got a thinking mind
Stop the bells that ring so loud
Don't nod your head, you'll draw a crowd
Just think of everything you've worked so hard to bring
The lemon sings my song. He's known it all along

Incidentally there should be some changes made
You've got to work if you should have to save
An apple is a fool but lemons never do forget
You've got to play it cool before they come and throw the net

// Really And Sincerely //

My mind is open wide
I'm on the other side
Though you remember my name
And if you go away
I'll get it off somehow
I'll leave it all in the air, no, no

Turn me down, turn me down
Turn me down, oh, how I've tried
Really and sincerely I've tried

There is a song
I hear it all around
But I don't hear a sound
If you were with me now
I'd let you know my mind
Love is so easy to lose, no, no

Turn me down. Turn me down
Turn me down. Oh, how I've tried
Really and sincerely

[Repeat and fade:]
Turn me down. Turn me down

// Birdie Told Me //

Birdie, told me, I must get over you, somehow
And she told me, never to think of you, right now

But it's hopeless to say
How can I forget the way she used to love me 
I think about her in my time
Know in my mind, it's over

Looks like falling
Heaven is calling my name to me
Funny faces loving the traces, memory

But it's hopeless to say
How can I forget the way she used to love me 
I think about her in my time
Know in my mind, it's over

Birdie, told me, I must get over you, somehow
And she told me, never to think of you, right now

But it's hopeless to say
How can I forget the way she used to love me 
I think about her in my time
Know in my mind, it's over

Birdie taught me, how to get over you

// With The Sun In My Eyes //

I do not need you
Nor do I listen to the words you say
Strongly I heed you
But every promise seems to fade away

Who is the clown
That walks in the steps of my shadow?
Is it the man
Who does what he can but never does it right?

How can I prove?
There is no reasoning or asking why
Only to prove
I love you deeply with the sun in my eyes

Who is the clown
That walks in the steps of my shadow?
Is it the man
Who does what he can but never does it right?

How can I prove?
There is no reasoning or asking why
Only to prove
I love you deeply with the sun in my eyes

I love you deeply with the sun in my eyes
I love you deeply with the sun in my eyes

// Massachusetts //

Feel I'm going back
To Massachusetts
Something's telling me
I must go home

And the lights all went out down in Massachusetts
The day I left
Her standing on her own

Tried to hitch a ride
To San Francisco
Gotta do the things
I wanna do

And the lights all went down in Massachusetts
They brought me back
To see my way with you

Talk about the life
In Massachusetts
Speak about the people
I have seen

And the lights all went down in Massachusetts
And Massachusetts
Is one place I have seen

(I will remember Massachusetts)
I will remember Massachusetts
(I will remember Massachusetts)
I will remember Massachusetts
(I will remember Massachusetts)
I will remember Massachusetts

// Harry Braff //

Checkered flag, checkered flag, checkered flag for Harry Braff
Checkered flag, checkered flag, checkered flag for Harry Braff
Goodbye Harry Braff, it's so good to see him win the race
And the crowd, feeling proud to spend all day out there
And getting a good view of Harry Braff, Harry Braff

Realise Harry Braff and the Mayor of Gordon cheers him on
Every mile, see him smile with the dust in his eyes
Everyone's crying for Harry Braff. Harry Braff

Goodbye! Harry Braff. Goodbye! Harry Braff
Goodbye! Harry Braff. Goodbye!

Checkered flag, checkered flag, checkered flag for Harry Braff
Checkered flag, checkered flag, checkered flag for Harry Braff
Goodbye, Harry Braff, it's so good to see him win the race
And the crowd, feeling proud to spend all day out there
And getting a good view of Harry Braff. Harry Braff

Goodbye! Harry Braff. Goodbye! Harry Braff
Goodbye! Harry Braff. Goodbye!

Harry Braff. Harry Braff. I'm a coming

// Daytime Girl //

There she goes my daytime girl
Spreading her wings like a high flying eagle
All the people will stare as she falls to the ground

Heaven knows my daytime girl
Never been kissed she don't know what she's missing
All the kisses there are to be found
All the wisdom of people she used
She took advantage of this
Taking time to remember the past
Remembering all she has missed

What a dream this place has been
Said when she left I believed when I saw him
All the seeing believing come true
All the wisdom of people she used
She took advantage of this
Taking time to remember the past
Remembering all she has missed

There she goes my daytime girl
Spreading her wings like a high flying eagle
All the people will stare as she falls to the ground

// The Earnest Of Being George //

You better run just as fast as you can
I've got no reason to try
You did it to me and I'm taking a stand
You've got a reason to cry

Fairy stories in the penny arcade
You bought my love and I paid
I'm not trying to make history
You could have been good to me

Fairy stories in the penny arcade
You bought my love and I paid (all right)
I'm not trying to make history
You could have been good to me

Spent my life making my love to you
I've got no reason to try
Got no reason left for making you blue
You've got a reason to cry

Fairy stories in the penny arcade
You bought my love and I paid
I'm not trying to make history
You could have been good to me

You better run just as fast as you can
You better run just as fast as you can

// The Change Is Made //

Look out my window. I can see tomorrow
Just a whole way of sorrow when the change is made
And I've been a-cryin'
Oh, Lord, I've been a cryin'
But I'll go on a-cryin' when the change is made
And I been a good man. Oh Lord, Lord, I've been a good man
But what's good's a good man after the change is made? Yeah!
And I'm not forgettin' all the love, the love, the love I been a-gettin'
I've got to go on a-livin' after the change is made
And I been a-cryin'. Oh Lord, Lord, I been a-cryin'
But I got to go on a-cryin' after the change is made
And I'm not forgettin' all the love, love I been a-gettin.'
'Cause I got to go on living after the change is made

And I'm not forgettin' all the love, all the love I been a-gettin'
And I got to go on livin' after the change is made
And I'm not forgettin' all the love I been gettin'
But I got to go on living after the change is made
And I'm not forgettin'

// Horizontal //

I have been lying under a pillow of dreams
And feeling moments of swimming in cream
This is the start of the end. Goodbye
Hours of facing my life have damned

You are a good friend
Friendly as good friends can be
Your father wants you to live on his knee
This is the start of the end. Climb by me
Red sides and blue sides within remind me

I have been lying under a pillow of dreams
And feeling moments of swimming in cream
This is the start of the end. Goodbye
Hours of facing my life have damned

// Out Of Line //

One day, when you're out of line
You'll say, can you spare the time?
Oh, I know you're out of line
Yes, I know you're out of line
And you will say every day
And you will play

Some say there's another day
I'm sure that my thing's OK
Though I know you're out of line
Yes, I know you're out of line
And you will say every day
And you will play

I am your friend

Though I know you're out of line
Yes, I know you're out of line
And you will say every day
And you will say

One day, when you're out of line
You'll say, can you spare the time?
Though I know you're out of line
Yes, I know you're out of line
And you will say every day
And you will play

We say, "Yes." We say, "Yes." We say, "Yes." We say, "Yes." 
We say, "Yes." We say, "Yes." We say, "Yes." We say, "Yes."

// Ring My Bell //

Let me show you how to be alive
There's no use to worry
Good luck's not far behind
Let me see you keep a steady life
It's no use to hurry
Nobody needs your wife

Ring my bell if you want me to

Let me show you how to be alive
There's no use to worry
Good luck's not far behind
Let me see you keep a steady life
It's no use to hurry
Nobody needs your wife

Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to

// Barker Of The UFO //

Barker sing me a song
Instead of counting trees
Collecting aeroplane numbers now, Mr. Barker

Live it up, shine my shoes
Fly me to the moon
Never before have I seen the light, Mr. Barker

Then the moment of depression fell around, Mr. Barker
And the changes of expression to a frown, My friend Barker

There must be something there
Shiner of the light, we demand we are here, Mr. Barker
Then the moment of depression fell around, Mr. Barker
And the changes of expression to a frown, my friend Barker
There must be something there
Shiner of the light, we demand we are here, Mr. Barker

Barker sing me a song
Instead of counting trees
Collecting aeroplane numbers now, Mr. Barker

Live it up, shine my shoes
Fly me to the moon
Never before have I seen the light

Barker sing me a song
Instead of counting trees
Collecting aeroplane numbers now, Mr. Barker

Live it up, shine my shoes
Fly me to the moon
Never before have I seen the light

// Words //

Smile, an everlasting smile
A smile could bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
'Cause that would bring a tear to me

This world has lost its glory
Let's start a brand new story
Now, my love, right now
There'll be no other time
And I can show you how, my love

Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me

You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say

It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away

You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say

It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away
It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away
It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away

// Sir Geoffrey Saved The World //

Ah.....
Ev'ry day's Saturday, feeling in steadily
Laughing at people with stars in their eyes
Vicar Hays approaching town, preaching in the underground
Talking with the lambs who came out of the sky
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world

Dinner time, anytime, see a crown, should be mine
Ev'ryone's grabbing but no one will get
Sunny day, should I care, taking in the garden air
Ev'ryone's happy though no one can see
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world

Ah...
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world

Ev'ry day's Saturday, feeling in steadily
Laughing at people with stars in their eyes
Vicar Hays approaching town, preaching in the underground
Talking with the lambs who came out of the sky
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world

// Sinking Ships //

Sinking ships
Watching them sail and the sun as sinks in the sea
Crashing planes
Only the eyes of the doomed with a smile on their face

So I say to myself, "Is it real?"
So I look inside myself
Can I feel?

Coloured cups
Windows that slide up and down with a squeak in the side
Funny day
Banging the door to a close as it's hurting my knee

// Really And Sincerely (Alternate Version) //

My mind is open wide
I'm on the other side
Though you remember my name
And if you go away
I'll get it off somehow
I'll leave it all in the air, no, no

Turn me down, turn me down
Turn me down, oh, how I've tried
Really and sincerely I've tried

There is a song
I hear it all around
But I don't hear a sound
If you were with me now
I'd let you know my mind
Love is so easy to lose, no, no

Turn me down, turn me down
Turn me down, oh, how I've tried
Really and sincerely I've tried

Turn me down
Turn me down
Turn me down
Turn me down

// Swan Song (Alternate Version) //

This is my swan song
Whatever I do now, I do it well
This is my swan song
I fell in love with you I love you well
And if the Lord provides the music for the world around to sing
My love will build a castle in the air

This is my last chance
A chance to show the world that I am strong
This is my last dance
I'm walking off the floor where I belong
And if the Lord provides the music for the world around to sing
My love will build a castle in the air

La...

And if the Lord provides the music for the world around to sing
My love will build a castle in the air

This is my swan song
I fell in love with you
I love you well
I love you well
I love you well

// Mrs. Gillespie's Refrigerator //

Talks about the cold on television
Appetizing in the intermission
Let's go look, glued to the screen
There she is, so terribly clean
I love her

Mrs. Gillespie, you know how to sell me
You made me blow my mind with things you tell me
Let's go look, glued to the screen
There she is, so terribly clean
I love her

Now she disappears back to the program
I return to bed, feeling so low down
Someone else is stealing my scene
Fading away into a dream
About her

// Deeply Deeply Me //

Deeply deeply deeply me
Deeply deeply deeply me

Gave my love a diamond ring
Platinum engagement thing
She told me our love can be
Deeply deeply deeply me

Taking thousand footstep drops
To the (parts) and from the top
I can't live without her now
Ending life I think somehow

Deeply deeply deeply me
Deeply deeply deeply me

// Thank You For Christmas //

Thank you for Christmas
For every little thank
We stand alone
And thank you a lot
For every child we'll sing

In your town, your dreamer bells
And time pass ticks away
A child you always think about
He is all night and day

Thank you for Christmas
For every little thank
We stand alone
And thank you a lot
Every child will sing

// Silent Night / Hark! The Herald Angels Sing (Medley) //

Hark the herald angels sing
A new king born today
And man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas Day

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleeping heavenly's peace
Sleeping heavenly's peace

The first Noel, the first Noel
Born is the king of Israel
The first Noel, the first Noel
Born is the king of Israel

Hark the herald angels sing
Listen to what they say
That man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas day
