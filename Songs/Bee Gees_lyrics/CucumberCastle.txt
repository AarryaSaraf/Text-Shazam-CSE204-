// If Only I Had My Mind On Something Else //

I could be king of kings
Wear a crown and all the things
I'd want I'd never need
I'd be an ace in an aeroplane
And every year, I'd fly to Spain
If I could get the nerve to plant the seed

Oh, help me how to say goodbye
I see her face in myself
Why, tell me why I made her cry
If only had my mind on something else

Captain of the submarine
Beneath the icebergs never seen
A hero with a medal for everyday
I find me fame, reach the top
I keep on pushing never stop
If I could just forget her name

Oh, help me how to say goodbye
I see her face in myself
Why, tell me why I made her cry
If only had my mind on something else
If only had my mind on something else

// I.O.I.O. //

I. O. I. I. I. I. I. I. O. I. O.
I. O. I. I. I. I. I. I. O. I. O.
I. O. I. I. I. I. I. I. O. I. O.
I. O. I. I. I. I. I. I. O. I. O.

You know I love getting up in the morning
When the sun first strikes the trees
All the morning birds that sing above
Still bring back memories
Of a girl who stood beside me
When the rights I did were wrong (wrong)
But she went back down the river
Just when I thought I could be strong
When I thought I could be strong, so I sing

I. O. I. I. I. I. I. I. O. I. O.
I. O. I. I. I. I. I. I. O. I. O.

She never told me why she left me
But the letter said goodbye (bye)
Now my mornings are for wondering
And my nights to reason why
Why a stranger comes to steal the love
Of a girl I had to hold
But she went back down the river
Just when I thought I could be strong
When I thought I could be strong, so I sing

I. O. I. I. I. I. I. I. O. I. O.
I sing, I. O. I. I. I. I. I. I. O. I. O.
I sing, I. O. I. I. I. I. I. I. O. I. O.
I. O. I. I. I. I. I. I. O. I. O.
I. O. I. I. I. I. I. I. O. I. O.
I. O. I. I. I. I. I. I. O. I. O.
I. O. I. I. I. I. I. I. O. I. O.

// Then You Left Me //

I never ask for any time from you baby
I never ask for any lies
You only hurt the one you love the most baby
You only had to make me cry

'Cause you left me (you left me) all alone (you left me)
You left me(you left me) to stand alone

And every night I sit beside my bed baby
And I keep thinking of your love
The things we dreamed about
How much I love you baby
We had the world and the stars above

But then you left me (you left me) all alone.(you left me)
You left me. You left me (you left me) to stand alone
You left me to stand alone
You left me to stand alone
You left me. You left me. You left me. You left me

// The Lord //

Play you a song

What do you get for trying?
Minute you're born, you're dying
Body is six feet down
The Lord said the soul sticks around

You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord
You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord

You think you live on laughter
But you don't know what's after
Singing hallelujah
I can know the master

You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord
You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord, yeah

When my life is over
Lie in fields of clover
Waiting for my own girl
Living in a new world, yeah

Well, you can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord
You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord

What do you get for trying?
Minute you're born, you're dying
The body is six feet down
The Lord said the soul sticks around

Well, you can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord
You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord

You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord
I'm gonna believe in the Lord

// I Was The Child //

When I was young
We walked to school
And I carried your books
'Cause even then I was a fool
But you grew up and said, "Goodbye."
I still remember the things that made me cry

For all too soon
My story ends
I found a love
Now not even friends
Why loving you
Loving me like you used to do
I was the child

I held your hand and I told you things
And I made you believe
Believe in fairy tales
And diamond rings

Then all too soon my story ends
I found a love now not even friends
Tell me why loving you
Loving me like you used to do
I was the child

// I Lay Down And Die //

Only last night when your arms held me tight
You told me you thought our love could last forever, forever
I was the one that gave you all my love when I thought
That our love could last forever, forever

I lay down and die
The whole world joins in
And everyone cries
As teardrops begin

I lay down and die

And when darkness falls
Can't see nothing at all

I lay down and die
The whole world joins in
I lay down and die
The teardrops begin

I lay down and die
And die
And die

I lay down and die
The whole world joins in
I lay down and die
And the teardrops begin

I lay down and die
And I lay down and die

// Sweetheart //

If your heart tells you so that you should leave me
Don't try to forget, you and I never met
And before you fly, one kiss should tell me why
You've forgotten all the words that you once said

Long as I've got you there beside me
Long as you're there to stand and guide me
The love we share no one can ever tear apart
Long as I've got this life I'm living
Long as it's you the love I'm with then
I'll keep on calling you sweetheart

If my love for you can't make you happy
Just open the door and you won't see my anymore
And before you fly, one kiss should tell me why
You've forgotten all the words that you once said
When you said

Long as I've got you there beside me
Long as you're there to stand and guide me
The love we share no one could ever tear apart
Long as I've got this life I'm living
Long as it's you the love I'm with then
I'll keep on calling you sweetheart

And I'll keep on calling you sweetheart

// Bury Me Down By The River //

I wasn't born in the morning. No
I must have been born in the night
I've done my load and I'll carry my load
And all I own is my knife

I wasn't born to be lucky
'Cause luck had no future with me

I've done my wrong and I'll sing, sing, sing my song
And stand beneath the hanging tree

Bury me down by the river
Let all the town's people see
Their enemy's dead, let me lay, lay my head
Just put me down and set me free

I wasn't born as a rich man. No
A rich man, I never, I never could be

I've done my wrong and I'll sing, sing, sing my song
And stand beneath the hanging tree
Everybody sing now

Bury me down by the river, Lord. No
Let all the town's people see, see
Their enemy's dead, let me lay, lay, lay my head
Just put me down and set me free
I want to hear everybody sing

Bury me down by the river
Let all the town'sâlet all the town's people see
Their enemy's dead, let me lay, let me lay, let me lay my head along
Just put me down and set me free

// My Thing //

I see my dog lying under the table
I see him licking my brother's girlfriend's hand
La de da da da
La de du da de du da de du du

I can't understand those eyes that keep staring at me
I can't understand how you do what you do to me
I keep on looking for you everywhere
I can't get used to the feeling you're giving me

Bowzey wow wowzey
Bowzey wow wowzey bow wowzey bow wowzey
Du du du du
La la la la la la la la la

// The Chance Of Love //

You and me we're both the same
In this life a lonely game
I used to be a happy man
And now I understand just what it's all about
I never had a doubt on the chance of love

As a boy I lived down here
I always saw you near
To be together was happiness
And I just can't forget the moment we first kissed
I'd like to try again on the chance of love

Yeah, on the chance of love
I'll do anything to get you by my side
On the sound of love I will love you girl
You'll be mine

All the world would then be free
An apple falls from an apple tree
You and I will be together
And you will understand when I take your hand
I'll open up the door to the chance of love

// Turning Tide //

What would I say if you should turn away from me
I do not know if there are words that I can see
I only know that I am reaching too high

And who are we to touch the wind
And say our ship is coming in
The turning tide

Tell me the answer in your changing mind, changing mind
I don't know if love can last

When time is gone and we are on the roundabout
Would you still laugh and be a clown when love runs out
Or will you say that I am reaching too high

And who are we to touch the wind
And say our ship is coming in
The turning tide

And who are we to touch the the wind
And say our ship is coming in
The turning tide

// Don't Forget To Remember //

Oh my heart won't believe that you have left me
I keep telling my self that it's true
I can get over anything you want my love
But I can't get myself over you

Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
I still remember you
I love you
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
Don't forget to remember me my love

On my wall lies a photograph of you girl
Though I try to forget you somehow
You're the mirror of my soul so take me out of my hole
Let me try to go on living right now

Don't forget to remember me
And the love that used to be
I still remember you
I love you
In my heart lies a memory to tell the stars above
Don't forget to remember me my love
