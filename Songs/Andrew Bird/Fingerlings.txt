// Why? //

Why? Why'd you do that?
You shouldn't have done that
If I told you once, I told you three times
That you'll get your punishment when you
Show me your crimes

And it's not a spell or a curse you put on me
Or the way you make me smile so tenderly
How I wish it was your temper you were throwing
Damn you for being so easygoing

I thought the time would tell
My sins would provoke you
To raise, raise some hell, oh...

Not a chance
Whatever happened to fiery romance
How I wish it was your dishes you were throwing
Damn you for being so easygoing

Why? Why'd you do that?
Why'd I do what, huh?
Nothing. You get it? What? Nothing.

I thought the time would tell
My sins would provoke you
To raise, raise some hell, oh...

Don't give me that line
Don't try to tell me inaction is not a crime
Can't you see what kind of seeds you're sowing?
Damn you for being so easygoing

// Headsoak //

I was walking
With my feet
A disposition
Fell over me

The armory wall was bleeding
The restless child was reading

I was swimming
Could hardly stand
The swimming hour was at hand
The fishes they were feeding
The lambs they were bleating

I walk slowly
When I walk away from you

I'm feeling bad
I'm looking bad
I feel and look so bad
Some might say
Yours truly is soaking his head

There's apprehension
And inhibition
All contributions
To my attrition
And it happened long ago
These things these things
That make me walk so darn slow

// How Indiscreet //

I saw you last night
My, my, how indiscreet
Your self-destruction is so complete
And I know
Yeah I know
That she's goin' down slow

It was this morning that you phoned
You sound strung out, babe, but so high toned
And I know
Yeah I know
That she's goin' down slow

You're the article babe
The genuine thing
And when that guy comes by
With his diamond ring
It doesn't feel right
And you tell him so
So you buy your ticket home
And you're going down slow

Wait a minute
What's this?
We're losing altitude
Hand over fist
And she's goin' down fast

// Keep Your Lamp Trimmed And Burning //

I said no, don't worry
no, please don't worry
no, don't worry
see what the Lord has done

just keep your lamp all trimmed and burning
keep your lamp trimmed and burning
keep your lamp all trimmed and burning
see what the Lord has done

I said no, don't worry
no no don't worry
no, don't worry
she what the Lord has done

just keep your lamp ...ed and and burning
keep your lamp all trimmed and burning
keep your lamp ...ed and burning
oh, see what the Lord has

// Gotholympians //

My pitiful sorrows have seen more tomorrows than yours
My rain really pours
At least more than yours
At least more than yours

In the depths of my sadness there's a beautiful madness you see
It's right here on my sleeve
You must not believe
I can see you just don't believe

So I really have to say it's all just so romantic
Cause I've seen the others try and they just seem pedantic

Cause when it comes to misery
When it comes to misery
When it comes to misery
No one competes with me

My sweeping emotions have spanned the great oceans
From this fifty foot wave I just can't be saved
O don't even try
I can't be saved

My pitiful sorrows have seen more tomorrows than yours
My rain really pours
At least more than yours
At least more than yours

So I really have to say it's all just so romantic
Cause I've seen the others try and they just seem pedantic

Cause when it comes to misery
When it comes to misery
When it comes to misery
No one competes with me

// Richmond Woman //

Give her a red lipstick and a bright pair of shoes
A new bob haircut and a shot of good booze
her/(hurry?) down-sweet daddy, I'm blowing your horn
oh if you come too late
no no, your mama' will be gone

come along young man, everything's sitting right here
my husband's gone away till next Saturday night
her/(hurry?) down-sweet daddy, I'm blowing your horn
oh if you come too late
no no, your mama' will be gone

I'm round-a-go, red shoes on my feet
got my mind set right for ten years at sea
her/(hurry?) down-sweet daddy, I'm blowing your horn
if you come too late
no no, your mama' will be gone

yeah cause the red rooster says "cock-a-doodle do do"
the wishing woman says "and a doodle do"
her/(hurry?) down-sweet daddy, I'm blowing your horn
if you come too late
no no, your mama' will be gone
one more time

red rooster says "cock-a-doodle do do"
the wishing woman says "and a doodle do"
her/(hurry?) down-sweet daddy, I'm blowing your horn
if you come too late
no no, your mama' will be gone

if you come too late
your mama' will be gone

// Sweetbreads //

When I was a little boy I threw away my action toys
I became obsessed with operation

with Hearts and minds and certain glands
You learn to keep a steady hand
And thus began a morbid fascination with...

sweetbreads, I could taste what you were thinking
sweetbreads, that's the taste of neurons thinking

Do you wonder where the self resides
Is it in your head or between your sides
And who's going to decide its true location?
cause it's a question for the centuries
from communion to mad cow disease
but is it worthy of a song - all life's location?

oh and the sweetest sweetbread of them all within the kingdom of afar
call them thoughts and metaphor-inations
they call them

sweetbreads, I could taste what you were thinking
sweetbreads, that's the taste of neurons thinking

does the thought of bowels red and black
the thought of tongues that taste you back fill you with a nauseous elation
where a simple trip to the grocery store could fill you with an abject horror
can you taste the misery of those crustaceans?

oh and the sweetest sweetbread of them all
within the kingdom of afar should've caused some silent machinations
they call them

sweetbreads, I could taste what you were thinking
sweetbreads, that's the taste of neurons thinking
aw, I could taste what you were thinking
oh, give me your thoughts about sweetbread
