// Death Wish //

Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
Something in her eyes like flipping off a light switch
Everybody dies but you gotta find a reason to carry on

Oh, and did you ever catch her climbing on the rooftop?
Higher than a kite, dead of winter in a tank top
I don't wanna fight with you, baby, but I won't leave you alone

The night was young once, we were the wild ones
Before we had to pay attention to the violence
Anything could happen but nothing ever really did
I wanted action, she wanted answers
Sunrise with the dealers and the dancers
It takes a whole lot of medicine to feel like a little kid

Oh, and did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
Something in her eyes like flipping off a light switch
Everybody dies but you gotta find a reason to carry on

Oh, and did you ever catch her climbing on the rooftop?
Higher than a kite, dead of winter in a tank top
I don't wanna fight with you, baby, but I won't leave you alone

Who's gonna save you? Who's left to pray to?
What's the difference in a breakdown and a breakthrough?
I saw her in the moonlight digging up the garden bed
I want to hold her until it's over
Let her sleep through the morning on my shoulder
But there's nothin' I could say to her that I ain't already said

Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
Something in her eyes like flipping off a light switch
Everybody dies but you gotta find a reason to carry on

Oh, and did you ever catch her climbing on the rooftop?
Higher than a kite, dead of winter in a tank top
I don't wanna fight with you, baby, but I won't leave you alone

When your words mean nothing
When the world turns to monochrome
And you know she's not bluffing
'Cause you feel it in your bones
You feel it in your bones

Oh, and did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
Something in her eyes like flipping off a light switch
Everybody dies but you gotta find a reason to carry on

Oh, and did you ever catch her climbing on the rooftop?
Higher than a kite, dead of winter in a tank top
I don't wanna fight with you, baby, but I won't leave you alone

I wanna hold her until it's over
Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
I wanna hold her until it's over
Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
Oh, I wanna hold her until it's over
Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
I wanna hold her, I wanna hold her
Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?

I wanna hold her until it's over
Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
I wanna hold her until it's over
Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?
Oh, I wanna hold her until it's over
Did you ever love a woman with a death wish?

// Middle Of The Morning //

Well I've tried to open up my window and let the light come in
I step outside in the middle of the morning and in the evening again
Yes I've tried to be grateful for my devils and call them by their names
But I'm tired and by the middle of the morning I need someone to blame

I know you're scared of me, I can see it in your face
I can feel it in the way you move around this place
I know you're scared of me, I can see it in your smile
Like an unattended child you can't quite trust

But I'm tired of stepping on your shadow and feeling in the way
Yes I'm tired and by the middle of the morning I'm out of shit to say

I ain't used to this, seeing everybody's hand
I was raised to be a strong and silent southern man
I ain't used to this, a thousand days alone
In my bed or in my head or in my phone

Yes I'm tired of living in the moment and sleeping through the dream
I step outside in the middle of the morning and the roses hear the scream

I know you're scared of me, so I never get too close
I just sit here on the tailgate like a farm hand's ghost
Watch the roses bloom, watch them wilt away and die
'Til I notice I've been crying this whole time

Well I've tried to open up my window and let the light come in
I step outside in the middle of the morning and in the evening again

// Cast Iron Skillet //

Don't wash the cast iron skillet
Don't drink and drive, you'll spill it
Don't ask too many questions or you'll never get to sleep
There's a hole inside you, fill it

Shower up and shave
Put flowers on the grave
And ask the Lord to save his soul
Although you know it's too late

Was it 27 times, or was it 29?
I heard the blade broke off inside the man
And he took a while to die

How did he get so low?
Seems like just a week ago
We were 10 and 12 years old

He was sweet and soft
Shied away from the inside fastballs
And died doing life without parole

Don't wash the cast iron skillet
That dog bites my kid, I'll kill it
Don't walk where you can't see your feet
Don't ask questions, just believe it

Jamie found a boyfriend
With smiling eyes and dark skin
And her daddy never spoke another word to her again

The old man at the Quickstop
Lying to the county cops
And laughing like his soul was without sin

How did he get so low?
Seems like just a week ago
She was sitting on your shoulders watching fireworks in the sky

He treats her like a queen
But you don't know 'cause you ain't seen
It's hard to go through life without your daddy by your side

Don't wash the cast iron skillet
This town won't get no better, will it?
She found love and it was simple as a weather vane
But her own family tried to kill it

Don't wash the cast iron skillet
Don't wash the cast iron skillet
Don't wash the cast iron
