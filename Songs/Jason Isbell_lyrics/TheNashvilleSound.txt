// Last Of My Kind //

I couldn't be happy in the city at night
You can't see the stars for the neon light
Sidewalk's dirty and the river's worse
The underground trains all run in reverse
Nobody here can dance like me
Everybody's clapping on the one and the three
Am I the last of my kind?
Am I the last of my kind?

So many people with so much to do
The winter's so cold my hands turn blue
Old men sleeping on the filthy ground
They spend their whole day just walking around
Nobody else here seems to care
They walk right past them like they ain't even there
Am I the last of my kind?
Am I the last of my kind?

Daddy said the river would always lead me home
But the river can't take me back in time
And daddy's dead and gone
The family farm's a parking lot for Walton's five and dime
Am I the last of my kind?
Am I the last of my kind?

I tried to go to college but I didn't belong
Everything I said was either funny or wrong
They laughed at my boots, laughed at my jeans
Laughed when they gave me amphetamines
Left me alone in a bad part of town
Thirty-six hours to come back down
Am I the last of my kind?
Am I the last of my kind?

Mama says God won't give you too much to bear
That might be true in Arkansas
But I'm a long, long way from there
That whole world's a lonely, faded picture in my mind
Am I the last of my kind?
Am I the last of my kind?
Am I the last of my kind?

// Cumberland Gap //

There's an answer here, if I look hard enough
There's a reason why I always reach for the harder stuff
It wasn't my daddy's way
He was down in the mines all day
I know he wanted more than mouths to feed and bills to pay

Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole

I ain't cut out for war, unless I know what I'm fighting for
And there's nothing here but churches, bars, and grocery stores
Ain't much money in the old-time mandolin
So I cash my check and I drink 'til I'm on my ass again

Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole

Remember when we could see the mountain's peak?
The sparkle off the amphibole?
Like a giant golden eagle's beak
Now they say no one wants the coal

I thought about moving away
But what would my mama say?
I'm all that she has left and I'm with her every day
As soon as the sun goes down
I find my way to the Mustang Lounge
And if you don't sit facing the window
You could be in any town

Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole

// Tupelo //

Haven't been wasted in a long time
But tonight it feels just fine
Riding home with the windows up, alone with a plastic cup of real good wine

If I get out of this hole I'm going to Tupelo
There is a girl out there that will treat me fair
You get about a week of Spring and the summer is blistering
There ain't no one from here that will follow me there
No there ain't no one from here that will follow me there

She said there's nothing left to talk about
At my age I should've figured out
Which drawer to put the good knives in
And the wars between the weekends tore the playhouse down
Kept her close but way too close to me
She never lived up to my memory
Driving fast with the windows down
A past I don't belong to now
A mystery

I get out of this hole I'm going to Tupelo
There is a girl out there that will treat me fair
You get about a week of Spring and then Summer is blistering
There ain't no one from here that will follow me there
No there ain't no one from here that will follow me there

I get out of this hole I'm going to Tupelo
There is a girl out there that will treat me fair
You get about a week of Spring and then summer is blistering
There ain't no one from here that will follow me there
Well there ain't no one from here that will follow me there

// White Man's World //

I'm a white man living in a white man's world
Under our roof is a baby girl
I thought this world could be her's one day
But her momma knew better

I'm a white man living in a white man's town
Want to take a shot of cocaine and burn it down
Momma wants to change that Nashville sound
But they're never gonna let her

There's no such thing as someone else's war
Your creature comforts aren't the only things worth fighting for
Still breathing, it's not too late
We're all carrying one big burden, sharing one fate

I'm a white man living on a white man's street
I've got the bones of the red man under my feet
The highway runs through their burial grounds
Past the oceans of cotton

I'm a white man looking in a black man's eyes
Wishing I'd never been one of the guys
Who pretended not to hear another white man's joke
Oh, the times ain't forgotten

There's no such thing as someone else's war
Your creature comforts aren't the only things worth fighting for
You're still breathing, it's not too late
We're all carrying one big burden, sharing one fate

I'm a white man living in a white man's nation
I think the man upstairs must'a took a vacation
I still have faith, but I don't know why
Maybe it's the fire in my little girl's eyes
Maybe it's the fire in my little girl's eyes

// If We Were Vampires //

It's not the long flowing dress that you're in
Or the light coming off of your skin
The fragile heart you protected for so long
Or the mercy in your sense of right and wrong

It's not your hands, searching slow in the dark
Or your nails leaving love's watermark
It's not the way you talk me off the roof
Your questions like directions to the truth

It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone or one day you'll be gone

If we were vampires and death was a joke
We'd go out on the sidewalk and smoke
And laugh at all the lovers and their plans
I wouldn't feel the need to hold your hand

Maybe time running out is a gift
I'll work hard 'til the end of my shift
And give you every second I can find
And hope it isn't me who's left behind

It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone or one day you'll be gone

It's knowing that this can't go on forever
Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone
Maybe we'll get forty years together
But one day I'll be gone or one day you'll be gone

// Anxiety //

Anxiety
How do you always get the best of me?
I'm out here living in a fantasy
I can't enjoy a goddamn thing
Anxiety
Why am I never where I am supposed to be?
Even with my lover sleeping close to me
I'm wide awake and I'm in pain

Watching the sunrise slash through the blinds
Dust in the room hovers over mine
Lying here in silence
Wife and child still sleeping deep enough to dream
And oh, I'm a lucky man today
But so afraid that time will take it all from me

Anxiety
How do you always get the best of me?
I'm out here living in a fantasy
I can't enjoy a goddamn thing
Anxiety
Why am I never where I am supposed to be?
Even with my lover sleeping close to me
I'm wide awake and I'm in pain

It's the weight of the world
But it's nothing at all
Light as a prayer, and then I feel myself fall
You got to give me a minute
Because I'm way down in it
And I can't breathe so I can't speak
I want to be strong and steady, always ready
Now, I feel so small, I feel so weak

Anxiety
How do you always get the best of me?
I'm out here living in a fantasy
I can't enjoy a goddamn thing
Anxiety
Why am I never where I am supposed to be?
Even with my lover sleeping close to me
I'm wide awake and I'm in a pain

A crowded room is a burning battlefield
If I don't move, I'll come undone
My heart beats harder, a hammer striking steel
Will I walk now or be a "Wait and Run"?

Anxiety
How do you always get the best of me?
I'm out here living in a fantasy
I can't enjoy a goddamn thing
Anxiety
Why am I never where I am supposed to be?
Even with my lover sleeping close to me
I'm wide awake and I'm in pain
I'm wide awake and I'm in pain
I'm wide awake and I'm in pain

// Molotov //

Another life but I still remember
A county fair in steamy September
In the Year of the Tiger 19-something
I was broke and you were unbroken
A little jokes to keep it unspoken
Even when I knew you were the last one

I broke a promise to myself
Ride the Throttle 'til wheels came off
Burn out like a Molotov
In the night sky
I broke a promise to myself
Made a couple to a brown eyed girl
Who rode with me through the mean ol' world
Never say die

Time flies when you're making babies
Do you miss your little black Mercedes
Do you miss the girl you once had time to be
When you said we had the same three wishes
I hope you weren't being facetious
And I hope you still see fire inside of me

I broke a promise to myself
Ride the throttle 'til the wheels came off
Burn out like a Molotov
In the night sky
I broke a promise to myself
Made a couple to a browneyed girl
Who rode with me in the mean ol' world
Never say Die

I broke a promise to myself
Ride the Throttle til the wheels came off
Burn out like a Molotov
In the night sky
I broke a promise to myself
Made a couple to a brown eyed girl
Who rode with me through the mean ol' world
Never Say Die

// Chaos And Clothes //

The ground was wet and the sky was dark
You took her bet, she took your heart
Wrapped it 'round an oak tree
Like you did that '67 GTO
Oh no

Lovers leave chaos and clothes
In quiet corners where you rarely ever go
One day you find proof that she was real
Despite your struggle to forget
Oh yes

You're in a fight to the death my friend
Black metal t-shirts your shield
You've got the past on your breath my friend
Now name all the monsters you've killed
Let's name all the monsters you've killed

The man she chose to take your place
Turns his collar up to better frame his face
How you'd love to hate her
But you just can't hate somebody you don't know
Oh no

Did she leave a trail of crumbs
So you could find her when you're what you could become
Or did she know you well enough
To realize that garden just won't grow?
Oh no

You're in a fight to the death my friend
Airways a grand battlefield
You've got your past on your breath my friend
Now name all the monsters you've killed
Let's name all the monsters you've killed

In my sleep I build machines
But nobody ever wants to hear about my dreams
Last night I saw a burning Ferris Wheel
The meaning's anybody's guess
Oh yes

Lovers leave chaos and clothes
More debris that you can sort through in one go
You say love is hell
But it's the ghost of love that's made you such a mess
Oh yes

You're in a fight to the death my friend
Fight like you're chained to the wheel
You've got the past on your breath my friend
Now name all the monsters you've killed
Let's name all the monsters you've killed

// Hope The High Road //

I used to think that this was my town
What a stupid thing to think
I hear you're fighting off a breakdown
I myself am on the brink

I used to want to be a real man
I don't know what that even means
Now I just want you in my arms again
And we can search each other's dreams

I know you're tired
And you ain't sleeping well
Uninspired
And likely mad as hell
But wherever you are
I hope the high road leads you home again

I heard enough of the white man's blues
I've sang enough about myself
So if you're looking for some bad news
You can find it somewhere else

Last year was a son of a bitch
For nearly everyone we know
But I ain't fighting with you down in a ditch
I'll meet you up here on the road

I know you're tired
And you ain't sleeping well
Uninspired
And likely mad as hell
But wherever you are
I hope the high road leads you home again
To a world you want to live in

We'll ride the ship down
Dumping buckets overboard
There can't be more of them than us
There can't be more

I know you're tired
And you ain't sleeping well
Uninspired
And likely mad as hell
But wherever you are
I hope the high road leads you home again
To a world you want to live in
To a world you want to live in

// Something To Love //

I hope you find something to love
Something to do when you feel like giving up
A song to sing or a tale to tell
Something to love, it'll serve you well

I was born in a tiny southern town
I grew up with all my family around
We made music on the porch on Sunday nights
Old man with an old guitar smoking Winston Lights

Old women harmonizing with the wind
Singing softly to the savior like a friend
They taught me how to make the chords and sing the words
I'm still singing like that great speckled bird

I hope you find something to love
Something to do when you feel like giving up
A song to sing or a tale to tell
Something to love, it'll serve you well

Tonight we're lying on a blanket in the yard
The wind is cold the sky is dark and the ground is hard
But your momma loves to count the stars at night
So if I get a little chill that's alright

I hope you find something to love
Something to do when you feel like giving up
A song to sing or a tale to tell
Something to love, it'll serve you well

You were born on a hot late summer day
We turned you loose and tried to stay out of your way
Don't quite recognize the world you call home
Just find what makes you happy girl and do it 'til you're gone

I hope you find something to love
Something to do when you feel like giving up
A song to sing or a tale to tell
Something to love, it'll serve you well
