Album: Kiss

// Call Me Maybe //

I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way

I'd trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

It's hard to look right
At you baby
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still, you're in my way

I beg, and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

It's hard to look right
At you baby
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad

It's hard to look right
At you baby
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

Hey, I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

And all the other boys
Try to chase me
But here's my number
So call me, maybe?

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad

Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
And you should know that

So call me, maybe?

// Curiosity //

Break a bone
Got me on my knees
You break my heart
Just to watch it bleed

I'm sick with love
Sick like a disease
Don't call me up
Just so I can please you

I can't stand the way you're smiling
I can't stand the way I'm lying

I know, I know, I know you got the key
And you know, you know, you know that it's for me
It's not up to you, you know it's up to me but
Curiosity will never let me go

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Uh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Will never let me go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Uh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Look at me
Left here in the corner
Stupid girl
I really tried to warn her

Walked the streets all night
Until you came around
Knew that you would come
Before you ever even made a sound

I know, I know, I know you got the key
And you know, you know, you know that it's for me
It's not up to you, you know it's up to me but
Curiosity will never let me, never let me go

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Uh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Will never let me go
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Uh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Curiosity

So don't break me tonight
This is crazy love
And you know I'm gonna follow you home
Through the rain
'Cause I need your love
And you know I'm gonna follow you home

'Cause I need your love and you know I'm gonna follow you

I know, I know, I know you got the key
You know, you know, you know that it's for me
Well well I think that we should try it out to see yeah
Curiosity

So don't break me tonight
This is crazy love
And you know I'm gonna follow you home
Through the rain
'Cause I need your love
Yes I need your love

So don't break (don't break) me tonight (me tonight)
This is crazy love
And you know I'm gonna follow you home
Through the rain
'Cause I need your love
Yes I need your love

Will never let me go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Will never let me go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Uh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Curiosity will never let me go
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Uh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

// This Kiss //

I went out last night
I'm going out tonight again
Anything to capture your attention (Your attention)
And she's a real sweet girl
And you know I got a boy
Details we both forgot to mention (Forgot to mention)

And you
I always know where you are
And you always know where I am
We're takin' it way too far
But I don't want it to end

This kiss is something I can't resist
Your lips are undeniable
This kiss is something I can't risk
Your heart is unreliable
Something so sentimental
You make so detrimental
And I wish it didn't feel like this
'Cause I don't wanna miss this kiss
I don't wanna miss this kiss
(This kiss, this kiss, this kiss)

You know you're just my type
And your eyes are lock and key
To my heart, tempting my confession (My confession)
And you're a real hot thing
But you know I've got a boy somewhere
So, can you feel the tension? (Feel the tension)

And you
I'm dancin' to where you are
And you're dancin' to where I am
We're takin' it way too far
But I don't want it to end

This kiss is something I can't resist
Your lips are undeniable
This kiss is something I can't risk
Your heart is unreliable
Something so sentimental
You make so detrimental
And I wish it didn't feel like this
'Cause I don't wanna miss this kiss

But if you ask me to, I couldn't, I couldn't, I
You lean in closer, and I shouldn't, I shouldn't, I
But if you ask me to, I couldn't, I couldn't, I
I couldn't, I shouldn't
I don't wanna miss this kiss

This kiss is something I can't resist
Your lips are undeniable
This kiss is something I can't risk
Your heart is unreliable
Something so sentimental (Sentimental)
You make so detrimental (Detrimental)
And I wish it didn't feel like this
'Cause I don't wanna miss this kiss

I wish it didn't feel like this
I don't wanna miss this kiss

// Good Time //

Hmm-mm-mm
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time

Woke up on the right side of the bed
What's up with this Prince song inside my head?
Hands up, if you're down to get down tonight (Hmm-mm-mm)
'Cause it's always a good time

Slept in all my clothes like I didn't care
Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere
I'm in if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time

Good morning and good night
I'll wake up at twilight
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time (Woo!)

Whoa-oh-oh-oh whoa-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh whoa-oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time
(Good time, good time, it's always a good time)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh)

Freaked out, dropped my phone in the pool again
Checked out of my room, hit the ATM
Let's hang out if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time

Good morning and good night
I'll wake up at twilight
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time

Whoa-oh-oh-oh whoa-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh whoa-oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time

Whoa-oh-oh-oh whoa-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh whoa-oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time

Doesn't matter when
It's always a good time then
Doesn't matter where
It's always a good time there

Doesn't matter when
It's always a good time then

It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh whoa-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh whoa-oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time

Whoa-oh-oh-oh whoa-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Whoa-oh-oh-oh whoa-oh-oh-oh (Doesn't matter where)
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time

Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

// More Than A Memory //

Speak to me
You're walking closer and it's hard to breathe
I should be running, but the heart's naive
And I expect too much
You were good to me
I left a scar that no one else can see
And now you're back here and reminding me
That I lost way too much

Do you know that night I almost said I loved you
And you almost said it back?

Are we gonna be more than a memory?
No matter how lame my apology
I let go of you, you let go of me
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
Are you gonna just stand in front of me
Pretending I'm not your destiny?
I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?

I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
(Memory, memory, memory)

Say my name
'Cause no one else can say it quite the same
It takes me back to your September days
I've missed you way too much
If I was cruel to you
Well just to hear it breaks my heart in two
If there's a way to make it up to you
I wanna change so much you know I do

And you know that night I almost said I loved you
And you almost said it back

Are we gonna be more than a memory?
No matter how lame my apology
I let go of you, you let go of me
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
Are you gonna just stand in front of me
Pretending I'm not your destiny
I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?

Stay with me
I really need to hear you breathe
If words can't speak
Lay your body next to me

Are we gonna be more than a memory? (More than a memory)
No matter how lame my apology (Lame my apology)
I let go of you, you let go of me
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
Are you gonna just stand in front of me (Stand in front of me)
Pretending I'm not your destiny? (Not your destiny)
I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?

More than a memory
Lame my apology

I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?

// Turn Me Up //

All alone, here I am
I don't know what I'm after
Now that you're just a friend
I can't call you and ask you
And from the very first time I saw your face

I knew I was satisfied
You were talking so sweet I had to taste
I wish I never tried

I'm breaking up with you
You're breaking up on me
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
What am I to do
And how's it gonna be
'Cause breaking us in two
Is breaking me in pieces

Breaking up with you
You're breaking up on me
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
What am I to do?
And how's it gonna be?
I'm giving up and going out tonight
Turn me up, turn me on
I'll turn me up, I'll turn me on

Turn me up (Turn me up)
Turn me on (Turn me on)
Turn me up (Turn me up)
Turn me on and on and on

And tonight
Here you are
And I know what you're after
But you're reading me wrong
'Cause I'm closing this chapter

And from the very first time I saw your face
I knew I was satisfied
You were talking so sweet, I had to taste
I wish I never tried

I'm breaking up with you
You're breaking up on me
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
What am I to do?
And how's it gonna be?
'Cause breaking us in two
Is breaking me in pieces

Breaking up with you
You're breaking up on me
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
What am I to do?
And how's it gonna be?
I'm giving up and going out tonight

Turn me up (turn me up), turn me on (turn me on)
Turn me up (turn me up), and turn me on (and on, and on)

Turn me up, turn me on
T-t-t-turn me up, and turn me on (and on)

Breaking up with you
You're breaking up on me
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
What am I to do?
And how's it gonna be?
I'm giving up and going out tonight

Turn me up (turn me up), turn me on (why don't you turn me on?)
Turn me up (why don't you turn me on?), turn me on (and on, and on, and on)

Turn me up (why don't you turn me on?), turn me on (turn me on, turn me on)
Turn me up (turn me up), turn me on

// Hurt So Good //

When you smile like a tease
Baby, you don't even know (You don't even know)
When my heart skips a beat, darling, every time you go
(Every time you go)

When you walk into the room
I can't speak and I can't move (I can't move)
You don't see me, but you should
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?

I don't ever wanna let you go
We could take it fast or make it slow
I'm the friend that you misunderstood
Every day is just a "wish I could" (I could)
Why you gotta make it hurt so good? (Hurt so good)
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?

All the girls on the block, they come knocking at your door (Knocking at your door)
You just stare out the window, what you waiting for?
(What you waiting for?)

Is it too late or too soon?
I'm right outside here wanting you (Wanting you)
You don't see me, but you should
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?

I don't ever wanna let you go
We could take it fast or make it slow
I'm the friend that you misunderstood
Every day is just a "wish I could" (I could)
Why you gotta make it hurt so good? (Hurt so good)

Imagine you, imagine me
Together so happily
Imagine me, imagine you
Inside a dream I built for two

When you walk into the room
I can't speak and I can't move (I can't move)
You don't see me, but you should
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?

I don't ever wanna let you go
We could take it fast or make it slow (Slow)
I'm the friend that you misunderstood
Every day is just a "wish I could" (Wish I could)
Why you gotta make it hurt so good? (So good)
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?

// Beautiful //

[Justin Bieber:]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Carly Rae Jepsen:]
Hello, I know it's been a while
I wonder where you are
And if you think of me sometimes
Cause you're always on my mind
You know I had it rough trying to forget you
But the more that I look around, the more I realize
You're all I'm looking for

What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are, to me
You're not tryna be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me (To me)
It's how you take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say
I wish somehow I could say them now
Oh, I could say them now, yeah

[Justin Bieber:]
Just friends, the beginning or the end
How do we make sense, when we're on our own?
It's like you're the other half of me
I feel incomplete, yeah, should have known
Nothing in the world compares to the feelings that we share
It's so not fair

What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are, to me
You're not tryna be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me (To me)
You try to take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say
I wish somehow
I could say them now, oh

[Carly Rae Jepsen & Justin Bieber:]
It's not you, blame it all on me, I was running from myself
'Cause I couldn't tell how deep that we, we were gonna be
I was scared, it's destiny, but it hurts like hell
Hope it's not too late, just a twist of fate, yeah

What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are, to me
You're not tryna be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me (To me)
It's how you take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say

[Carly Rae Jepsen (Justin Bieber) {Both}:]
{I wish somehow} (I could say them now)
Oh, I could say them now, {mm}

// Tonight I'm Getting Over You //

I wanna smash your fears
And get drunken off your tears
Don't you share your smile with anyone else but me
I wanna touch your heart
I wanna crush it in my hands
Make you plead and cry, as you give up all the lies

We're not lovers, but more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying to get me through
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight, I'm getting over you

Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Over you, over you

Stuck in a real bad dream
And man, it feels so new to me
Should be in your arms, but I'm beggin' at your feet
It's been a real hard night, and I just hold my pillow tight
It won't love me back, no, it's not you and I

We're not lovers, but more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying to get me through (Get me through)
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight, I'm getting over you

Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Over you, over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Tonight, I'm getting over you (Tonight)
Tonight, I'm getting over you
Over you, over you

We're not lovers, but more than friends
(Tonight, I'm getting over you, tonight, I'm getting over you)
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
(Tonight, I'm getting over you, tonight, I'm getting over you)
No more crying to get me through
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight, I'm getting over you

// Guitar String / Wedding Ring //

You were here, and then you left
Now there's nobody, nobody
Now they're all just second best
There's nobody, nobody

So if you want me, I'll be around
You're a bird in the water
I'm a fish on the ground
Just hold me closer
Oh, won't you hold me down tonight?

But if you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it like it's a wedding ring
Wrapped around my finger, you know what I mean?
You play my heart strings
If you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it, this is the real thing
Wrapped around my finger, you know what I mean?
You play my heart strings

And when you're near, I feel the best
I'm somebody, somebody
It's in my pulse, it's in my chest
My whole body, whole body

So if you want me, I'll be around
You're a bird in the water
I'm a fish on the ground
Just hold me closer
Oh, won't you hold me down tonight?

But if you cut a piece of guitar string

Wrapped around my finger, you know what I mean?
You play my heart strings

You're in the country and I'm in the town

And I want to be there for you tonight
And I hope you hear me
Baby, hold on tight
Hold on tight, yeah

You play my heart strings

// Your Heart Is A Muscle //

You gave my shirt back
I don't really get the meaning
It's like you're giving up before it all goes wrong
I've been told but I don't really like the feeling
I've been away, I've been away too long

I, I, I wanna go wherever you are
I, I, I wanna be wherever you are
I, I, I wanna see whatever you are

You say love's a fragile thing
Made of glass
But I think
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle
You gotta work it out
Make it stronger
Try for me just a little longer
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle

It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle
It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle

If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it'll light up your eyes (Light up your eyes)

Wake up moon, we'll spend the night alone together
(Spend the night alone together)
You're a real good listener, but you don't have much to say
Wake up you, you won't pick up the phone whatever
You're probably sleeping, I hope we're still OK

I, I, I wanna go wherever you are
I, I, I wanna be wherever you are
I, I, I wanna see whatever you are

You say love's a fragile thing
Made of glass
But I think
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle
You gotta work it out
Make it stronger
Try for me just a little longer
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle

It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle
It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle
If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it'll light up your eyes
If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it'll light up your eyes

You say love's a fragile thing
Made of glass
But I think
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle
You gotta work it out
Make it stronger
Try for me just a little longer
Your heart is a muscle
Your heart is a muscle

It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle
It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle

If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it'll light up your eyes

// Drive //

I had a bad dream
You were there
Like you always are
I had a bad day
I don't care
When I'm in your car

So drive so fast, baby, through the night
Drive so fast, and they're never gonna find you
Drive so fast, saying no goodbyes
Drive so fast, and we'll leave it all behind you

Ooh, I don't care about my lipstick
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love
Chasing the sun, don't wanna miss it
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love

You're laughing at me in your head
With my teasing games
Let's talk about you
You're in love
Wanna change my name

So drive so fast, baby, through the night
Drive so fast, and they're never gonna find you
Drive so fast, saying no goodbyes
Drive so fast, and we'll leave it all behind you

Ooh, I don't care about my lipstick
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love
Chasing the sun, don't wanna miss it
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love
Ooh, I don't care about my lipstick
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love
Chasing the sun, don't wanna miss it
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love

Boy, I get a kick out of you
You know I'm yours
The things you're making me do
I never thought, you'd hit me to the core
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love

I just wanna drive you to love, love, love

Ooh, I don't care about my lipstick
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love
Chasing the sun, don't wanna miss it
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love
Ooh, I don't care about my lipstick
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love
Chasing the sun, don't wanna miss it
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love

// Wrong Feels So Right //

You got your way with me now didn't ya
And I don't know why
Things you do are things we've done before
Don't you be looking at me darling with your sneaky eyes
Now what can you be looking at me for?

Sometimes when I'm lonely I close my eyes
Some nights when I can't sleep I fantasize
Hard to believe that you're right here tonight
I'm going out of my mind
Oh

I think this could be the one night
I give in to this fight
Boy I just might
'Cause you rule my head
I can't stop the motion
Hold me, be the way you told me
Whisper something so sweet
This could be the night
Wrong feels so right

This could be the night
Wrong feels so right

Breaking my heart to see you lover
And I don't know why
Things you say are things you've said before
'Stead of the truth I swear you'd stick a needle in your eye
Now what can you be looking at me for?

Sometimes when I'm lonely I close my eyes
Some nights when I can't sleep I fantasize
Hard to believe that you're right here tonight
I'm going out of my mind
Oh

I think this could be the one night
I give in to this fight
Boy I just might
'Cause you rule my head
I can't stop the motion
Hold me, be the way you told me
Whisper something so sweet
This could be the night
Wrong feels so right

Tell me what was I supposed to do
With that type of attention
I gave all that I had to you
You forgot to mention
When you say that your heart is true
It's just an invention
But not your intention no, no

Tell me what was I supposed to do
With that type of attention
I gave all that I had to you
You forgot to mention
When you say that your heart is true
It's just an invention
But not your intention no, no

I think this could be the one night
I give in to this fight
Boy I just might
'Cause you rule on my head
I can't stop the motion
I can't stop the motion
Wrong feels so right

This could be the night
Wrong feels so right

This could be the night
Wrong feels so right

// Sweetie //

We were both headed different ways
Both in a rush, trying to get away
I ran into you-ou-ou
Like a crash of thunder
Out in the rain waiting for the bus
We started talking 'bout different stuff
And it's true-ue-ue
There's an eighth world wonder
And from now on

You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you

Anything you want boy
I can make it happen
We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie
Anytime of day boy
I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
I could be your sweetie, sweetie
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
Anything you want boy
I can make it happen
We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie, sweetie

A dinner date and a glass of wine
We stayed up late and lost track of time
When I'm with you-ou-ou
I feel a different hunger
You held my hand and you didn't let go
I'm gonna kiss you now
I thought you should know
And it's true-ue-ue
There's an eighth world wonder
And from now on

You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you

Anything you want boy
I can make it happen
We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie
Anytime of day boy
I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
I could be your sweetie, sweetie
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
Anything you want boy
I can make it happen
We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie

Anything you want boy
Anything you need
Anything you want boy
Anything you need

Anything you want boy
I can make it happen
We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie
Anytime of day boy
I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
I could be your sweetie, sweetie

You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you

Anything you want boy
I can make it happen
We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie
Anytime of day boy
I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
I could be your sweetie, sweetie

You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
That all I wanna do, is just be true to you
And give you satisfaction
Sweetie, sweetie
Yea

// Almost Said It //

I always want more
I'm never gonna get it
You're gonna be the one I never got that got away
And I'll regret it
Just a moment in time
But I can't forget it
Yeah, we almost said it

If this is love, ooh
I should be dying
But I'm going downtown like I still care
Like I'm still trying
I said I was over you but I'm lying
There, I almost said it

Every time you look at me
I say it silently
Oh, when will you wake up and get it
This close, we almost said it

I know you're not evil
So why do you tease me
Yeah, staying around here late at night
You don't make it easy
It's in my body language, read me
We were this close
This close, yeah

And it's like every time you look at me
I say it silently
Oh, wake up, baby, come and get it
This close, we almost said it
You say that you're still not free
Well, I hear selectively
That still means someday you might be
Oh, this close, yeah, yeah

You wrote me a song
I often play it
Depending on where I am with you
I either love it or I hate it
We were just this close but we couldn't say it
We were this close

// I Know You Have A Girlfriend //

Baby I don't need to look far
Everywhere I turn there, there you are
Somebody should sound the alarm
'Cause when you try to get me alone
You talk to me in riddles
You treat me like a crime

I know you have a girlfriend
So don't kiss me on the lips
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh don't you tell me what I did
I know you have a girlfriend
And every time you speak
You're lying through your t-t-teeth
I know you have a girlfriend
And I hear she's kinda nice
I know you have a girlfriend
So don't give me those eyes
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh won't you let me be
I'm beggin' you, stop beggin' me
I'm beggin' you, stop beggin' me

Tip-toein' around all the facts
Tease me 'til I laugh and I relax
I know there's a reason for that
'Cause you've been tryin' to get me alone
And talk to me in riddles
You cover me in rhymes

I know you have a girlfriend
So don't kiss me on the lips
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh don't you tell me what I did
I know you have a girlfriend
And every time you speak
You're lying through your t-t-teeth
I know you have a girlfriend
And I hear she's kinda nice
I know you have a girlfriend
So don't give me those eyes
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh won't you let me be
I'm beggin' you, stop beggin' me
I'm beggin' you, stop beggin' me

You're sick with dreams about it
Didn't I, didn't I blush
I think, I think, I think
I want it way too much

I know you have a girlfriend
And it cuts me like a knife
I know you have a girlfriend
And she's gonna be your wife
I know you have a girlfriend
And every time you speak
You're lying through your t-t-teeth
I know you have a girlfriend
Tell me where is she tonight
I know you have a girlfriend
'Cause I heard you had a fight
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh won't you let me be
I'm beggin' you, stop beggin' me
I know you have
I'm beggin' you, stop beggin' me
I know you have, I know you have a girlfriend

// Melt With You //

If I could melt with you, I would
I'd find our way back to good (To good)
Tell the world to wait outside (Outside)
Just you and I
And if I could hold on to your edge
And fall to your deepest ends
We would come true, if I could melt with you
(If I could melt with you)

I've been thinking about it
I know something's wrong
Fading out in the distance (Distance)
We've been lost in the songs
Let's turn the clocks to somewhere we won't ever stop
Don't ever leave

If I could melt with you, I would
I'd find our way back to good (To good)
Tell the world to wait outside (Outside)
Just you and I
And if I could hold on to your edge
And fall to your deepest ends
We would come true, if I could melt with you
(If I could melt with you)

Hearing echoes and voices (Voices)
All I couldn't see (See)
We have all kinds of choices (Choices)
If it was up to me
I'd turn the clocks to somewhere we won't ever stop
Don't ever leave

If I could melt with you, I would
I'd find our way back to good (To good)
Tell the world to wait outside (Outside)
Just you and I
And if I could hold on to your edge
And fall to your deepest ends
We would come true, if I could melt with you

And every time that passes by, I see you
I see you
Ever now and then, I like to pretend

If I could melt with you, I would
And find our way back to good (To good)
Tell the world to wait outside (Outside)
If I could hold on to your edge
And fall to your deepest ends
We would come true, if I could melt with you

If I melt with you
If we could come true
If I melt with you (With you, with you)
If I melt with you
If we could come true
If I melt with you
