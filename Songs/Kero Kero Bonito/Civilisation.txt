// Battle Lines //

Know the nation you keep
Identify and feed them their grief
Cut them off from the people
Take each cell and repeat
Assign their trouble to the unseen
Then protected, you'll be

Make dull chaos the rule
Reduce their spirits and you'll find soon
They'll be too weak to fight you
By the will of God our power is total
Fake a disaster state
The enemy will make itself plain

For in a world that never takes a form
The battle lines are gone
And war is always on, somehow
But we are all the soldiers, now

I see blood in my dreams
A beaten face, the gas
The streets, a screen

So we shall do our mothers proud
If we are all the soldiers, now

I surrender, and I relinquish all my weapons
We together, are terrifying, asking a question
I surrender, and I relinquish all my weapons
We together, are terrifying, asking a question

I know what I wanna go get
And I ain't gonna make it complicated
We lay down the law in this place
So you don't need to save us
I know what I wanna go get
And I ain't gonna make it complicated
We lay down the law in this place
So you don't need to say

// When The Fires Come //

When the hills are aglow with the light at the end of the day
And we usher our children into the shade
In the warm summer silence suspended aloft in the air
There a cricket sings alone
Ancient songs of home
Where now
Deep in the forest
That no one dares to see or know
A young spark smoulders

All around the world they weep
Now they know it's true-true-true-true
The Sun's returned to send us home to Earth
Everybody takes their time making work to do-do-do-do
But no one will be left here to remember us
When the fires come

As a pillar of smoke reaches over to strangle the land
We desert all we have as fast as we can
For the valleys
Then I see when I look right behind me
At the seam of the rocks and the trees, it roars
It's angry

All around the world they weep
Now they know it's true
The Sun's returned to send us home to Earth
Everybody takes their time making work to do
But no one will be left here to remember us
When the...
All around the world they weep
Now they know it's true-true-true-true
The Sun's returned to send us home to Earth
Everybody takes their time making work to do-do-do-do
But no one will be left here to remember us
When the fires come
When the fires come
When the fires come

// The River //

Holy mother
Receive our hearts in your arms
And let our souls pass
The day the rain returns again
Holy mother
Receive our hearts in your arms
And let our souls pass
The day the rain returns again

We pass down our wisdom
After sunshine comes thunder
The longer the drought
The heavier the clouds

Collecting water in glass
Counting the days against the crops that last, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
A dwarf shoot yawns at the sky
Daring a stratonimbus in the vicinity to spit on it

When Earth is submerging
And heaven is open
The river will carry all of us
To where we belong

But then a shadow is cast
Over the fields, a shower first
Then a torrent crashes down
Releasing the jungle swelling in the ground
And as was foretold, our time is out

Holy mother
Receive our hearts in your arms
And let our souls pass
The day the rain returns again
Holy mother
Receive our hearts in your arms
And let our souls pass
The day the rain returns again
Holy mother
Receive our hearts in your arms
And let our souls pass
The day the rain returns again
Holy mother
Receive our hearts in your arms
And let our souls pass
The day the rain returns again

We pass down our wisdom
After sunshine comes thunder
The longer the drought
The heavier the clouds

When Earth is submerging
And heaven is open
The river will carry all of us
To where we belong
And no-one shall be left over
(Where we belong)
For the river's too strong
(Where we belong)
I trust mother to know
(Where we belong)
So watch the raindrops

// The Princess And The Clock //

Oh, ooh, oh
High up in a chamber
She painted pictures of the man that made her
Oh, ooh, oh
Shadowed by a clock face
The hands were rusted at the time she came in

When she played outside
She saw the birds, so high
But she made a wish
To grow, one day, her own pair of wings

She sailed long from the fall
To find herself in the world
When in the wind, she heard a burning call
And so she followed it and came ashore
On the beach with a crowd all waiting here for you
Then a voice said, "It was true
We all prayed for a princess
You're the one, heaven sent"

Oh, ooh, oh
High up in the chamber
She painted pictures of the man that made her
Oh, ooh, oh
Just to remember
Before the memory got lost in the dark
Oh, ooh, oh
Shadowed by a clock face
The hands were rusted at the time she came in
Though she shrugged the passing of the days
Eternally a child she would remain

But while she flies like the wind
The air escaped into silence
She woke up laying on a gilded bed
With half a dozen maids around her
"We're keeping you safe in a tall place
Where you can see all imagining for miles
By God's decree
Hail to the girl, our Queen"

As the nights ran
Together blurring into years
Her brush strokes never disappeared

Oh, ooh, oh
High up in the chamber
She painted pictures of the man that made her
Oh, ooh, oh
Just to remember
Before the memory got lost in the dark
Oh, ooh, oh
Shadowed by a clock face
The hands were rusted at the time she came in
Though she shrugged the passing of the days
Eternally a child she would remain

Until one day when the clatter rang through the hills
They found my call in the smashed open windowsill
A feather high in the air
And the once-stopped clock was ticking on

// 21/04/20 //

Out of bed just after one
Don't have time to catch the sun
All the bugs are at their business
And the flowers are in bloom
We take a note of their perfume
Underneath the pale spectre of the moon
And I just stand there waiting
Getting my sunbeams

Last night's pasta in a tub
Out the fridge for lunch and breakfast
But as I sit down to eat
I hear a song riding the breeze
Happy birthday to Eloise
Their mom and dad both let out a cheer
They're gonna throw a party another year
And I should take a walk for a bit

As I head up the road
A private ambulance zooms off into the distance
In silence, all the shops are closed
With rainbows painted on the glass
Covering notes that they hope to see us soon
But right now there's not much they can do
I dodge a jogger or two

Back at home, I'm playing a game
Rewatch repeats, I set a call up with a friend
A means towards an end, 'til we can meet again
"Hey, so, how are you doing?"
"I'm okay, you know, the usual kinda weird"

So we animate the cosmos, darken our minds
Eventually the song heralds the dawn
I can't stifle my yawns
I make my bed up after I floss
And tuck in tightly
For a new day

// Well Rested //

For all of existence
Humanity has been guided by only one principle
To keep living

We will never cease to seek the day
Or give up the future come what may
Living runs
In our blood
Though the earth will turn a final time
There is more to know and much to find
So we must
Hold the sun
Over us

Over us

False prophets proclaim that the end is nigh
And that humanity is not worth existence
This is a trap laid to ensnare the living
A lie of the weak-willed
The inhuman
Their temples are in disarray
And they surely cannot know
What only Gaia knows

The resurrection will come
Only when Gaia requires it
It will not come soon
If we care for our mother
Instead, we will be well rested

And we will be well rested
When the ascension comes
And we will be well rested
When the ascension comes

And we will be well rested
When the ascension comes
And we will be well rested
When the ascension comes
And we will be well rested
When the ascension comes
And we will be, yeah

We are taught hopeless death
To break down our resistance to it
This is a hallmark of the unholy temple
We must fight the unnatural cause of anti-humanity
And listen to the earth's word

Humanity
(All life)
We carry forward
(A family)
Will follow us
(In silence)
'Til the day we arise for
Eternity
(All time)
Is stored within us
(Our destiny)
Is a path that never alters
From the first to the last of
Humanity
(All life)

We have survived a hundred apocalypses

Doomsday hasn't come yet
You cannot stop civilisation
