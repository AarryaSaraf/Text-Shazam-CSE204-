// Hardwired //

In the name of desperation
In the name of wretched pain
In the name of all creation
Gone insane

We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct

GO!

On the way to paranoia
On the crooked borderline
On the way to great destroyer
Doom design

We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct

Once upon a planet burning
Once upon a flame
Once upon a fear returning
All in vain

Do you feel that hope is fading?
Do you comprehend?
Do you feel it terminating?
In the end

We're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct
Hardwired to self-destruct

Self-destruct
Self-destruct
Self-destruct

// Atlas, Rise! //

Bitterness and burden
Curses rest on thee
Solitaire and sorrow
All Eternity

Save the Earth and claim perfection
Deem the mass and blame rejection
Hold the pose, reign perception
Grudges break your back

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on, right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, Rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, Rise!

Crucify and witness
Circling the sun
Bastardize and ruin
What have you become?

Blame the world, and blame your maker
Wish âem to the undertaker
Crown yourself the other savior
So you carry on

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on, right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, Rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, Rise!

Masquerade as maker
Heavy is the crown
Beaten down and broken
Drama wears you down

Overload, the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and heaven crumbles
All alone, the fear shall humble
Swallow all your pride

All you bear
All you carry
All you bear
Place it right on, right on me

Die as you suffer in vain
Own all the grief and the pain
Die as you hold up the skies
Atlas, Rise!

How does it feel on your own?
Bound by the world all alone
Crushed under heavy skies
Crushed under heavy skies
Atlas, Rise!

// Now That We're Dead //

When darkness falls
May it be
That we should see the light

When reaper calls
May it be
That we walk straight and right

When doubt returns
May it be
That faith shall permeate our scars

When we're seduced
Then may it be
That we not deviate our cause

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

When all is pain
May it be
It's all we've ever known

When flame consumes
May it be
It warms our dying bones

When loss has won
May it be
It's you I'm madly fighting for

When Kingdom comes
May it be
We walk right through that open door

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live forever

All sinners, a future
All saints, a past
Beginning, the ending
Return to ash

Now that we're dead, my dear
We can be together
Now that we're dead, my dear
We can live, we can live forever

Return to ashes, shed this skin
Beyond the black, we rise again
We shall live forever

// Moth Into Flame //

Blacked out
Pop queen, amphetamine
The screams crashed into silence

Tapped out
Doused in the gasoline
The high times going timeless

Decadence
Death of the innocence
The pathway starts to spiral

Infamy
All for publicity
Destruction going viral

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, kill the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Twisted
Backstabbing wicked
The delusion absolution

Perjurer
Fame is the murderer
Seduce you into ruin

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, tell the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
Burn

Guarantee your name, you go and kill yourself
The vultures feast around you still
Overdose on shame and insecurity
If one won't do that fistful will

Death scene
Black hearse the limousine
A grave filled with seduction

Vaccine
Fame does the murdering
She builds up for destruction

So light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, no excuse
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Addicted to the
Fame

// Dream No More //

He sleeps under black seas waiting
Lies dreaming in death
He sleeps under cosmos shaking
Stars granting his breath

He wakes as the world dies screaming
All horrors arrive
He wakes giving earth its bleeding
Pure madness alive

And He haunts you
And He binds your soul
And He loathes you
And reclaims it all

You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say

Cthulhu, awaken

He sways in abyss returning
Inhaling black skies
He shakes with a torture burning
All lost in his eyes

And He haunts you
And He binds your soul
And He loathes you
And reclaims it all

You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say

Cthulhu, awaken

You turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they say

Sanity taken
Seething damnation
Cthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Winged salvation
Death by creation
Cthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Dreaming no more

Cthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Dreaming no more
Cthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Dreaming no more

// Halo On Fire //

Obey
Obey
Come won't you stay
Sincere
Sincere
All ends in tears
Endure
Endure
Thoughts most impure
Concede
Concede
But both shall we bleed

Oh, Halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell
I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light
Halo on fire

Allure
Allure
Sweetness obscure
Abide
Abide
Secrets inside
Deprive
Deprive
To feel so alive
Obey
Obey
Just don't turn away

Oh, Halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell
I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light
Halo on fire

Prayers cannot get through
Return to sender
Unto which of you
Shall I surrender
Twisting in disguise
Dark resurrection
Lighting up the skies
Wicked perfection

Too dark to sleep
Can't slip away
Open or close
My eyes betray
Beyond the black
Come won't you stay

Hello darkness
Say goodbye
Hello darkness
Say goodbye
Hello darkness
Say goodbye

// Confusion //

Wake to face the day
Grab this life and walk away
War is never done
Rub the patch and battle on
Make it go away
Please make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My lifeâ¦
The war that never ends

Leave the battlefield
Yet its horrors never heal
Coming home from war
Pieces don't fit anymore
Make it go away
Please make it go away

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
All sanity is but a memory
My lifeâ¦
The war that never ends

Father please come home
Shell shocked all I've known
Father please come home

Label him a deadwood soldier now
Cast away and left to roam
Rapid is the road to sacrifice
Just takes longer to come home

Confusion
All sanity is now beyond me
Delusion
Crossfire ricochets inside me
Trapped in a memory forever
My lifeâ¦
The war that never ends

// ManUNkind //

Chaos,
Awaiting for Adams return
Madness,
Smiling as we watch it burn

I've become

Hostage to my mind
Left myself behind
Blind lead blind
Quest to find
Faith in man(un)kind

Garden,
Of Eden, so simple and pure
Greedy,
Needy, must we have more

I've become

Hostage to my mind
Left myself behind
Blind lead blind
Quest to find
Faith in man(un)kind

Fascinate
Partner of insanity
Decimate
Lessons we never learn

Dominate
Killing of the innocence
Deviate
And to dust you return
Yeah

Seized by the day
Frozen captive by the night
Seized by the day
All the dark days of your life

Seized by the day
Frozen captive by the night
Led so astray
All the dark days of your life

Zero,
Reset, creation of man
Foolish,
Ready, to witness again?

I've become

Hostage to my mind
Left myself behind
Blind lead blind
Quest to find
Faith in man(un)kind

Faith in man(un)kind
Oh, faith in man(un)kind
Faith in man(un)kind
Oh, faith in man(un)kind

// Here Comes Revenge //

Little grave I'm grieving, I will mend you
Sweet revenge I'm dreaming, I will end you

I've been here since dawn of time
Countless hatreds built my shrine
I was born in anger's flame
He was Abel, I was Cain
I am here
I'm hell unbound
Burn your kingdom to the ground
To the ground

Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, is killing me
Revenge, set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge

I return this nightmare, I will find you
Sleepless, cloaked in despair, I'm behind you

Man has made me oh so strong
Blurring lines of right and wrong
Far too late for frail amends
Now it's come to sweet revenge
Desperate hands
That lose control
Have no mercy on your soul
On your soul

Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, is killing me
Revenge, just set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge

Here comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, is killing me
Revenge, set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revenge

Sweet revenge

// Am I Savage? //

Ooooh,
Run away, the past will bite again
Ooooh,
No matter where you dwell
You,
Here again, a captive of the howl
You,
Welcome back to hell

Faithful, as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the Beast are colliding

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks angers reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change

Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore

Ooooh,
Tooth is fang, twisting under skin
Ooooh,
Foul tongue, black breath
Change,
Snap inside, the Beast about complete
Change,
Soon infects the rest

Faithful, as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the Beast are colliding

Sharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks angers reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you change

Am I savage?
Howling at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore
Anymore


Ooooh,
Inheritance, the past has bit again
Ooooh,
The next heir of anarchy
Feel,
Stretching skin so far beyond belief
I feel,
The ever changing, you, in me

Am I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
Howling evermore
Am I savage?
I don't recognize me anymore
Anymore

Anymore, ha ha ha
Am I savage?

// Murder One //

One crown
Shines on through the sound
One crown
Born to lose
One man
Does not give a damn
One man
No excuse

Aces wild
Aces high
All the aces
Aces 'til you die

White lines fading
The iron horse rolls on and on and on

Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
Living to win

One fist
Hammers through the mist
One fist
Steady on
One heart
Die hard from the start
One heart
Beats its song

Murder all
Murder one
Gimme murder
Second class to none

Headlights fading
The iron horse rolls on and on and on

Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
Living to win

Hear your thunder
Still feeding back
I still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
No excuse

Till the end
Been living to win
Been living to win

// Spit Out The Bone //

Come unto me and you will feel perfection
Come unto me and dedicate
Come unto me, you'll never feel rejection
Come unto me and terminate
Remove your heart, it's only good for bleeding
Bleeding through your fragile skin
Remove your thought cause it's only for deceiving
Deceiving thoughts destroy within
Disappear like man was never here

Long live machine
The future supreme
Man overthrown
Spit out the bone

Plug into me I guarantee devotion
Plug into me and dedicate
Plug into me and I'll save you from emotion
Plug into me and terminate
Accelerate, Utopian solution
Finally cure the Earth of man
Exterminate, speeding up the evolution
Set on course a master plan
Reinvent the earth inhabitant

Long live machine
The future supreme
Man overthrown
Spit out the bone

The flesh betrays the flesh
Your man has had his time
We lay him down to rest
Machined the new divine

Stop breathing
And dedicate to me
Stop dreaming
And terminate for me
All meaning
You dedicate to me
All feelings
You terminate for me

Disappear like man was never here

Long live machine
Our future supreme
Your man overthrown
Spit out the bone, yeah

// Lords Of Summer //

Sight
Pale riders into the night
Galloping harder and faster

Through your dreaming wake
Walk towards the fire innate
Frost bitten soul below zero

Excitation
Are you remembering the sound?
Recall the shaking of the ground?

Pounding, pounding
No remorse
Lords of summer set on course

Pushing, pushing
Horsemen ride
Lords of summer undenied

At last the thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
So celebrate and let your fires burn
The lords of summer have returned

Straight
Light passes through
Penetrate
It's been a long lonely winter

Illumination
Bright
Bathe in the volume and light
Reanimated by fire

Transformation
Become the nexus of the sound
Become the shaking of the ground

Pounding, pounding
No remorse
Lords of summer set on course

Pushing, pushing
Horsemen ride
Lords of summer undenied

At last the thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
So celebrate and let your fires burn
The lords of summer have returned

Whoa... pounding, pounding
No remorse
Lords of summer set on course

Whoa... pushing, pushing
Horsemen ride
The lords of summer undenied, undenied

At last the thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
So celebrate and let your fires burn
The lords of summer have returned

[A Light In The Black intro]

[Tarot Woman]

I don't wanna go
Something tells me no, no, no, no
But traces in the sand
The lines inside my hand say go go go

Beware of a place
A smile on a bright shiny face
I'll never return, how do you know

Tarot woman, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

She can take you there
The entrance to the fair, my, my, my
Ride the carousel
Cast a magic spell, you can fly, fly, fly

Beware of a place
A smile on a bright shiny face
I'll never return, how do you know

Tarot woman, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

[Stargazer]

High noon
Oh I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years' worth
Of breakin' my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides
Why he's lighter than air
Oh I see his face

Where is your star
Is it far, is it far, is it far
When do we leave
I believe, I believe, yes, I believe

In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
Just to see him fly
So many die

We built a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
Don't know why

Now where do we go

[Kill The King]

Danger, danger the Queen's about to kill
There's a stranger, stranger and life about to spill
Oh no move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the wind
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on

Kill the king
Tear him down
Kill the king, yeah
Strike him down

Power, power happens every day
Power, devour all along the way
Oh no, move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
And fly like the wind
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on

Kill the king
Strike him down

Treason, treason, the spectre looms again
Treason, reason, the realm is safe and then
Oh no, move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the rainbow
I'm no pawn, so be gone, speed on and on

Kill the king, yeah
Tear him down
Kill the king, yeah
Got to take his crown

// When A Blind Man Cries //

If you're leaving, close the door
Not expecting people, anymore
Hear me grieving, lying on the floor
Whether drunk or dead, I really ain't too sure

I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
And my world is pale
When a blind man cries
Lord, you know
There ain't a sadder tale

Had a friend once, in a room
Had a good time, but it ended much too soon
In a cold month, in that room
Found a reason, for the things we had to do

I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
Now my room is cold
When a blind man cries
Lord, you know
He feels it from his soul, yeah

Yeah yeah
I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
And my world is pale, yeah yeah
When a blind man cries
Lord, you know
There ain't a sadder tale

// Remember Tomorrow //

Unchain the colours before my eyes,
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,
I shall return from out of the fire.

Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy,
Tears for somebody not this lonely boy.
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,
Flickers above us, to light up the sky.

Unchain the colours before my eyes,
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.
Scan the horizon, the clouds lift me higher,
I shall return from out of the fire.

Fire, fire, fire, fire
