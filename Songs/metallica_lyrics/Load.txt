// Ain't My Bitch //

Outta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine

Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of time

Headstrong
Whatâs wrong?
Iâve already heard this song before
You arrived, but now itâs time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless

It ainât my fall
It ainât my call
It ainât my bitch
It ainât my bitch

Down on the sun
Down and no fun
Down and out, where the hell you been?

Damn it all down
Damn it unbound
Damn it all down to hell again

Stand tall
Canât fall
Never even bend at all before
You arrived, but now itâs time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless

It ainât my fall
It ainât my call
It ainât my bitch

Outta my way

Outta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine

Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of time

Headstrong
Whatâs wrong?
Iâve already heard this song before
You arrived, but now itâs time to kiss your ass goodbye
And now itâs time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
While you around?
So useless

It ainât my fall
It ainât my call
It ainât my bitch

No way but down
Why youâre around
No fooling

It ainât my smile
It ainât my style
It ainât my bitch
Oh, it ainât mine

Ainât mine
Your kind
Youâre stepping out of time

Ainât mine
Your kind
Youâre stepping out of time

Taking me down
Why you around
No fooling

It ainât my fall
It ainât my call
It ainât my bitch
You ainât mine

// The House Jack Built //

Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes just to have them close again
Well on my way, but on my way to where Iâve been
It swallows me as it takes me in its fog
I twist away as I give this world the nod

Open door, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin

Open my eyes just to have them closed once again
Donât want control
As it takes me down and down and down again
Is that the moon or just a light that lights this dead-end street?
Is that you there or just another demon that I meet?

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Step into the house that Jack built

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built

Open door, yes, I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take the sin
Let the show begin

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built

The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body, my temple
This temple, it tilts
Yes, I am, I am, I am

Open my eyes
It swallows me
Is that you there
I twist away
Away
Away
Away

// Until It Sleeps //

Where do I take this pain of mine?
I run, but it stays right by my side

So tear me open, pour me out
Thereâs things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now it stays

So tear me open but beware
Thereâs things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until Iâm clean

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me
Until it sleeps

So tell me why youâve chosen me
Donât want your grip
Donât want your greed
Donât want it

Iâll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, holds you, holds you
Until it sleeps

I donât want it

So tear me open but beware
Thereâs things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me... till clean

Iâll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps
Until it sleeps

// King Nothing //

Wish I may, wish I might
Have this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold, dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things youâve chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But thereâs no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castleâs crumbled
And youâre left with just a name

Whereâs your crown,
King Nothing?
Whereâs your crown?

Hot and cold, bought and sold
A heart as hard as gold
Are you satisfied?
Wish I might, wish I may
You wish your life away
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things youâve chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But thereâs no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castleâs crumbled
And youâre left with just a name
Whereâs your crown, King Nothing?
Whereâs your crown?

I wish I may, I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight
I want that star, I want it now
I want it all and I donât care how

Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish, you may regret it
Careful what you wish, you just might get it

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But thereâs no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castleâs crumbled
And youâre left with just a name

Whereâs your crown, King Nothing?

Nothing

Youâre just nothing
Whereâs your crown, King Nothing?
Youâre just nothing
Absolutely nothing

Off to never-never land

// Hero Of The Day //

Mama, they try and break me

The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms no matter where theyâve gone
Theyâre off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someoneâs wicked way?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Did you hear your babies crying?

Mama, they try and break me
Still they try and break me

Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now, deservingly, this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair

Donât want your aid
But the fist I make
For years canât hold or feel
No, Iâm not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feel

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build the wall, behind it crawl
And hide until itâs light
So can you hear your babies crying now?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Did you feel your names?
Did you hear your babies crying?

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl
And hide until itâs light
So canât you hear your babies crying now?

Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama they try
Mama they try

// Bleeding Me //

I'm diggin' my way
I'm diggin' my way to something
I'm diggin' my way to somethin' better

I'm pushin' to stay
I'm pushin' to stay with something
I'm pushin' to stay with something better

I'm sowing the seeds
I'm sowing the seeds I've taken
I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted

This thorn in my side
This thorn in my side is from the tree
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted

It tears me and I bleed
And I bleed

Caught under wheel's roll
I take the leech I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
I can't take it
Caught under wheel's roll
The bleeding of me
Of me
The bleeding of me

Caught under wheel's roll
I take the leech I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
I can't take it
Caught under wheel's roll
The bleeding of me
The bleeding of me

I am the beast that feeds the feast
I am the blood, I am release
Come make me pure
Bleed me a cure
I'm caught, I'm caught, I'm caught under

Caught under wheel's roll
I take that leech I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
I can't take it, I can't take it, I can't take it
The bleeding of me

Come on
Bleed me

I'm digging my way
I'm digging my way to something
I'm digging my way to something better

I'm pushing to stay
I'm pushing to stay with something
I'm pushing to stay with something better

With something better

// Cure //

The man takes another bullet
He keeps them all within
He must seek no matter how it hurts
So donât fool again

He thinks the answerâs cold and in his hand
He takes his medicine
The man takes another bullet
Heâs been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say,
âI do believeâ

Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say
âI do believeâ
âI do believeâ

The lies tempt her and she follows
Again she lets him in
She must believe to fill the hollow
Sheâs been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say
âI do believeâ

Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say,
âI do believeâ
âYeah, I do believeâ

Betting on the cure
It must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyoneâs got to have the sickness
âCause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure

Betting on the cure
âCause it must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyoneâs got to have the sickness
âCause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure

âI do believeâ

Betting on the cure
It must get better than this
Need to feel secure
Itâs got to get better than this
It must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyoneâs got to have the sickness
âCause everyone seems to need the cure

âI do believeâ

// Poor Twisted Me //

Oh, poor twisted me
Oh, poor twisted me
I feast on sympathy
I chew on suffer
I chew on agony

Swallow whole the pain
Oh, itâs too good to be
That all this misery
Is just for, oh, poor twisted me
Poor twisted me

Poor mistreated me
Poor mistreated me
I drown without a sea
Lungs fill with sorrow
Lungs fill with misery

Inhaling the deep, dark blue
Oh, woe is me
Such a burden to be
The poor mistreated me

To finally reach the shore, survive the storm
Now youâre bare and cold, the sea was warm
So warm, you bathe your soul again

Baby, again and again and again

You finally reached the shore, survived the storm
Now youâre bare and cold, the sea was warm
So warm, you bathe your soul again

Good to feel my friend
Oh, woe is me
Such a burden to be
Oh, poor twisted me
Yo, poor twisted me

// Wasting My Hate //

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Donât waste, waste your breath
And I wonât waste my hate on you

Ainât gonna waste my hate
Ainât gonna waste my hate on you
I think Iâll keep it for myself

Ainât gonna give no more
Ainât got the time to help you score
I think itâs time you pleased yourself
Yourself

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Donât waste, waste your breath
And I wonât waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
Hate

You think youâre worthy now?
You think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two-pronged crown?

Well I see my hands, I see my feet
I feel that blood that pumps in beat
But where the hellâs my mind going now?
Dead gone now

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Donât waste, waste your breath
And I wonât waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you

Think Iâll keep it for myself

// Mama Said //

Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
Son, your lifeâs an open book
Donât close it âfore itâs done
The brightest flame burns quickest
Thatâs what I heard her say
A sonâs heartâs owed to mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still

âRebel,â my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
I left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

Mama, now Iâm coming home
Iâm not all you wished of me
A motherâs love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stoneâs all I see

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

// Thorn Within //

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned
Find me guilty of the life I feel within

When Iâm branded, this mark of shame
Should I look down, disgraced, or straight ahead and know that you must blame?

I am the secret
I am the sin
I am the guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within

Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned
Find me guilty when true guilt is from within

So point your fingers, point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you, one and the same are we

I am the secret
I am the sin
I am the guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within

I do your time, I take your fall
Iâm branded guilty for us all

So point your fingers, point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you, one and the same are we

I am your secrets
I am your sin
I am your guilty
And I am, I am the thorn within

I am the thorn within
I am the thorn within

// Ronnie //

Story starts, quiet town
Small-town boy, big-time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way

Then streets of red... red, Iâm afraid...
Thereâs no confetti, no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But, oh my God, how it all did change

Now they all pray,
âBlood stain, wash awayâ

He said,
âLost my way
This bloody day
Lost my wayâ

I heard it
He said,
âLost my way
This bloody day
Lost my wayâ
Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

I always said somethingâs wrong
With little, strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed, never smiled
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles

âGallows calls, son,â I say
Keep your smile and laugh all day
Think once again in this boring place
For little boys, how they soon change
And they all pray,
âBlood stain, wash awayâ

He said,
âI lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my wayâ
I heard it
He said,
âI lost my way
This bloody day
I lost my wayâ
Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

Well, all the green things died when Ronnie moved to this place
He said, âDonât you dare ask why Iâm cursed to wear this faceâ
Now we all know why the children called him Ronnie Frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocket they all fall down, down, down

He said,
âLost my way
This bloody day
Lost my wayâ

Yeah, yeah
I heard it
He screamed,
âLost my way
This bloody day
Lost my wayâ

Oh, please wash away
But blood stained the sun red today

All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today

All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today

// The Outlaw Torn //

And now I wait my whole lifetime for you
And now I wait my whole lifetime for you

I ride the dirt, I ride the tide for you
I search the outside, search inside for you

To take back what you left me
I know I'll always burn to be
The one who seeks so I may find
And now I wait my whole lifetime

Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn

So on I wait my whole lifetime for you
So on I wait my whole lifetime for you

The more I search, the more my need for you
The more I bless, the more I bleed for you

You make me smash the clock and feel
I'd rather die behind the wheel
Time was never on my side
So on I wait my whole lifetime

Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
Outlaw of torn
And I'm torn

Hear me
And if I close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
See me
And if my face becomes sincere
Beware
Hold me
And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
Save me
And when you see me strut
Remind me of what left this outlaw torn
