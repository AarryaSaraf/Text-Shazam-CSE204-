Album: Waterloo

// Waterloo (Swedish Version) //

Jo, jo, vid Waterloo Napoleon fick ge sig
Men, men, sitt Ã¶de kan man mÃ¶ta pÃ¥ sÃ¥ mÃ¥nga skilda sÃ¤tt
SjÃ¤lv kÃ¤nner jag, sen jag mÃ¶tt dig
Historien upprepar sig

Waterloo - jag Ã¤r besegrad, nu ger jag mig
Waterloo - lova mej nÃ¶jet att Ã¤lska dig
Waterloo - allting kÃ¤nns rÃ¤tt, och det Ã¤r min tro
Waterloo - du Ã¤r mitt Ã¶de, mitt Waterloo
Wa Wa Wa Wa Waterloo - du Ã¤r mitt Ã¶de, mitt Waterloo

Jo, jo, man vÃ¤rjer sig och fÃ¤ktas i det lÃ¤ngsta
Men, men, mot kÃ¤nslor kÃ¤mpar gudarna fÃ¶rgÃ¤ves har man sagt
Det Ã¤r som jag hÃ¶rde en sÃ¥ng
Jag tror det Ã¤r kÃ¤rlek pÃ¥ gÃ¥ng

Waterloo - sÃ¥ har man funnit sin Ã¶verman
Waterloo - mÃ¤ktig och vÃ¤ldig och stark Ã¤r han
Waterloo - allting kÃ¤nns rÃ¤tt, och det Ã¤r min tro
Waterloo - du Ã¤r mitt Ã¶de, mitt Waterloo
Wa Wa Wa Wa Waterloo - du Ã¤r mitt Ã¶de, mitt Waterloo

Det Ã¤r som jag hÃ¶rde en sÃ¥ng
Jag tror det Ã¤r kÃ¤rlek pÃ¥ gÃ¥ng

Waterloo - sÃ¥ har man funnit sin Ã¶verman
Waterloo - mÃ¤kting och vÃ¤ldig och stark Ã¤r han
Waterloo - allting kÃ¤nns rÃ¤tt, och det Ã¤r min tro
Waterloo - du Ã¤r mitt Ã¶de, mitt Waterloo
Wa Wa Wa Wa Waterloo - du Ã¤r mitt Ã¶de, mitt Waterloo

// Sitting In The Palmtree //

See me sitting in the palmtree
Looking down at people passing by
Sitting here no-one can harm me
They just stare at me and wonder why
No need to bother, I'm gonna stay up here
Whatever happens, I won't let no-one near
Until you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please
You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now
And in the evening, when the sun goes down
I'll be the bluest of men in this town
'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind

See me sitting in the palmtree
Waiting for those little words from you
People laugh and point their fingers
Like I was a monkey at the zoo
But I will stay here, among my coconuts
So you will know dear, you're everything I've got
Now won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind

Winds blow, stars glow, I see a light in a window
Dark trees, soft breeze, carry my message to her please

See me sitting in the palmtree
Feeling angry at the silly crowd
No-one else but you can calm me
You should know by now I'm far too proud
I need to show you, I've got my feelings too
You shouldn't treat me like you always do
So won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please
You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now
And in the evening, when the sun goes down
I'll be the bluest of men in this town
'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind
Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine
Jeanie Jeanie on my mind
Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine
Jeanie Jeanie on my mind
Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine

// King Kong Song //

Well I was looking at a movie on the TV last night
Then I had a very funny notion, yeah
I really had to write a song about it
And then I'm gonna sing it with my rock'n roll band
And I bet the people gonna like it, yeah
I know that everybody's gonna shout it

And what a dreadful mighty killer
A big black wild gorilla

We do the King Kong song, won't you sing along
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong
We do the Kong Kong song, gotta sing along
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song

Now we can make the jungle out of any old place
We can make gorillas out of people, yeah
Well who can tell a monkey from a monkey?
So people get together, gonna have a good time
Everybody listen to the music, yeah
'Cause what we're gonna sing is kinda funky

So let your arms hang down
And waddle all around
Like a dreadful mighty killer
A big black wild gorilla

We do the King Kong song, won't you sing along
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong
We do the Kong Kong song, gotta sing along
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song

Like a dreadful mighty killer
A big black wild gorilla

We do the King Kong song, won't you sing along
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong
We do the Kong Kong song, gotta sing along
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song

We do the King Kong song, won't you sing along
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong
We do the Kong Kong song, gotta sing along
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song

// Hasta Manana //

Where is the spring and the summer
That once was yours and mine?
Where did it go? 
I just don't know
But still my love for you will live forever

Hasta Manana 'til we meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
Darling, our love was much too strong to die
We'll find a way to face a new tomorrow
Hasta Manana, say we'll meet again
I can't do without you
Time to forget, send me a letter
Say you forgive, the sooner the better
Hasta Manana, baby, Hasta Manana, until then

Where is the dream we were dreaming
And all the nights we shared
Where did they go? 
I just don't know
And I can't tell you just how much I miss you
Hasta Manana 'til we meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
Darling, our love was much too strong to die
We'll find a way to face a new tomorrow
Hasta Manana, say we'll meet again
I can't do without you
Time to forget, send me a letter
Say you forgive, the sooner the better
Hasta Manana, baby, Hasta Manana, until then

Hasta Manana, say we'll meet again
I can't do without you
Time to forget, send me a letter
Say you forgive, the sooner the better
Hasta Manana, baby, Hasta Manana, until then

// My Mama Said //

Tried to sneak out without saying
With my loudest record playing
Ooh, my mama said, "Look at this, you haven't done your bed"
My mama said, "That's a thing that you should do instead"

Yeah, I did what she had told me
Dying for my friend to hold me
Ooh, my mama said, "Try and get one thing into your head"
My mama said, "Pa and me, we give you room and bed"
How I wanna live my life
Wanna live my life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life

In the morning she said "Listen"
Ooh, I felt like in a prison
Yeah, my mama said, "I know you've been out again with Fred"
(My mama said)
My mama said, "Don't you lie, your cheeks are blushing red"
(My mama said)
Oh I wanna live my life
Wanna live my life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life

I said, "I can live without him.
How I wish you wouldn't doubt him."
Oh oh, my mama said, "If you want to hurt me go ahead"
(My mama said)
My mama said, "I suppose you'd rather see me dead"
(My mama said)
Oh I wanna live my life
Wanna live my life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life
La-la-la, la-la-la, life

// Dance (While The Music Still Goes On) //

Oh, my love it makes me sad.
Why did things turn out so bad?
Was it just a dream, everything we did, everything we had?

Baby, give me one more
Dance while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow.
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own
A thing to remember when we're all alone
So dance, it's our way to say goodbye

Yes, all we have to do is
Dance while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
Dance, don't you hear them play our song
God knows that we've been trying
But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same
We just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame
So dance while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye

Yet it seems to make me sad.
Why did things turn out so bad?
Was is just a dream, everything we did, everything we had?

Baby, give me one last
Dance while the music still goes on
Just like the night I met you
Dance and believe me, when you're gone
You know I won't forget you
Our love was a snowbird, it's flying away
You tell me it's over, what more can I say?
So dance while the music still goes on
It's gonna be our last goodbye

Dance while the music still goes on
Don't think about tomorrow
Dance and forget our time is gone
Tonight's a night we borrow.
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own
A thing to remember when we're all alone
So dance while the music still goes on
And let it be our last goodbye

Dance while the music still goes on
This is no time for crying
Dance, don't you hear them play our song
God knows that we've been trying
Dance while the music still goes on
Just like the night I met you
Dance and believe me, when you're gone
You know I won't forget you

// Honey Honey //

Honey honey, how you thrill me
Ah-hah, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kill me
Ah-hah, honey honey

I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean
You're a love machine
Oh, you make me dizzy

Honey honey, let me feel it
Ah-hah, honey honey
Honey honey, don't conceal it
Ah-hah, honey honey

The way that you kiss goodnight
(The way that you kiss me goodnight)
The way that you hold me tight
(The way that you're holding me tight)
I feel like I wanna sing
When you do your thing

I don't wanna hurt you, baby, I don't wanna see you cry
So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high
But I'm gonna stick to you, boy, you'll never get rid of me
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be

Honey honey, touch me, baby
Ah-hah, honey honey
Honey honey, hold me, baby
Ah-hah, honey honey

You look like a movie star
(You look like a movie star)
But I know just who you are
(I know just who you are)
And, honey, to say the least
You're a doggone beast

So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be

Honey honey, how you thrill me
Ah-hah, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kill me
Ah-hah, honey honey

I heard about you before
(I heard about you before)
I wanted to know some more
(I wanted to know you some more)
And now I know what they mean
You're a love machine
Oh you make me dizzy

Honey honey, how you thrill me...

// Watch Out //

You move like a flame of fire
Your eyes like a flash of lightning
The answer to all desire
And I'm gonna tame you, wild thing

You'd better watch out
I said you'd better watch out, watch out
Anywhere you go I'll find you watch out
I'll be staying close behind you

And I'm tired of waiting
Yes, it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading
Oh, you'd better watch out
I said, "You'd better watch out"

It's been kind of funny lately
You act like I was a stranger
I think you're beginning to hate me
But then you're a girl in danger

You'd better watch out
Ooh, I said you'd better watch out watch out
Anywhere you go I'll find you watch out
I'll be staying close behind you

And I've tired of waiting
Yes, it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading
So, you'd better watch out
Yes, I said, "You'd better watch out"
Watch out, watch out

And I'm tired of waiting
Yes, it's driving me crazy
And my patience is fading
I said, "You'd better watch out"
Oh, girl you'd better watch out
Ah, you'd better watch out
Ooh, ah, you'd better watch out

// What About Livingstone //

Went to buy me a paper at the local news-stand
And then I heard them laugh and say
Look, they're gonna go flying way up to the moon now
Hey, what's it good for anyway?
So I said
Fellas, like to ask you a thing if I may

What about Livingstone?
What about all those men?
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while
Travelling up the Nile
Putting themselves on test
Didn't that help the rest?
Wasn't it worth it then?
What about Livingstone?

And all of those fellas at the local news-stand
Didn't know what to answer or what to say
So I told them about him, that he was just like
One of those spacemen in his way
And if you laugh at them
Then there's only a thing I can say

What about Livingstone?
What about all those men?
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while
Travelling up the Nile
Putting themselves on test
Didn't that help the rest?
Wasn't it worth it then?

What about Livingstone?
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)
What about all those men?
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)
Travelling up the Nile
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)
Putting themselves on test
Didn't that help the rest?
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)
Wasn't it worth it then?
What about Livingstone?
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)
What about all those men?
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)

// Suzy-Hang-Around //

Suzy was nine and I was ten
Right at the time when boys like to think they're men
She used to follow us at school
We really thought that she was a little fool
And one day we said to her
We don't want to hurt you girl
But you'd better

Look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure
So get off our playground and stay away
That's all that we've got to say
Suzy-hang-around

Suzy went home to Mama's arms
Mama said "Look, she's never done you no harm
So get off her back and let her be
Why can't you play together in harmony?"
We really didn't know what to say
But as soon as she went away
We laughed and said

Look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure
So get off our playground and stay away
That's all that we've got to say
Suzy-hang-around

Yes you'd better
Look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure
So get off our playground and stay away
That's all that we've got to say
Suzy-hang-around

// Waterloo //

My, my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
Oh yeah, and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself

Waterloo - I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo - promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo - couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo - knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo - finally facing my Waterloo

My, my, I tried to hold you back but you were stronger
Oh yeah, and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight
And how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose

Waterloo - I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo - promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo - couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo - knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo - finally facing my Waterloo

So how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I lose

Waterloo - couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo - knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo - finally facing my Waterloo

Waterloo - knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo - finally facing my Waterloo
Waterloo - knowing my fate is to be with you

// Honey, Honey (Swedish Version) //

Honey honey, underbara, ah-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, sÃ¶ta rara, ah-ha, honey honey
Dom viskar sÃ¥ sÃ¶ta ord
Du Ã¤r deras allt pÃ¥ jord
Det dÃ¤r ska du inte tro
Bara ta't me' ro
SÃ¥nt Ã¤r bara smicker

Honey honey, inte illa, ah-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, flicka lilla, ah-ha, honey honey
Den kvarnen som mal Ã¤r tom
Och det Ã¤r en ynkedom
Nej, killar som snackar sÃ¥
Litar ingen pÃ¥

Det brukar va' dom som sviker
Som ivrigast hÃ¥llit me'
Men vet man det bara
SÃ¥ kan man nog klara det

Tro inte pÃ¥ Ã¶nskesmicker
Och passa dej vad du gÃ¶r
Och hÃ¥ll dej med benen pÃ¥ jorden
Ja, vad du Ã¤n hÃ¶r

Honey honey, viskar alla, ah-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, lÃ¤tt att falla, ah-ha, honey honey
Men tro bara det du vill
Och lÃ¤gg inte mÃ¤rke till
Det sÃ¶ta du alltid hÃ¶r
Som sÃ¥ mÃ¥nga gÃ¶r

Tro inte pÃ¥ smicker
Nej, passa dej vad du gÃ¶r

Ja, hÃ¥ll dig med benen pÃ¥ jorden
Ja, vad du Ã¤n hÃ¶r
Honey honey, underbara, ah-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, sÃ¶ta rara, ah-ha, honey honey
Men socker Ã¤r inte allt
SÃ¥ ta't me' en nypa salt
Och Ã¤r du fÃ¶rststÃ¥ndig se'n
Tar du inte en
Nej, dÃ¥ tar du mÃ¥

// Waterloo (French Version) //

DÃ©jÃ , Ã  Waterloo NapolÃ©on a dÃ» se rendre
Et moi, je crois que mon destin prend
Aujourd'hui le mÃªme chemin
Les livres d'histoire et la vie
Racontent la mÃªme comÃ©die

Waterloo - tu es vainqueur et je perds la guerre
Waterloo - je me constitue ta prisioniÃ¨re
Waterloo - je ne peux plus fuir et plus t'Ã©chapper
Waterloo - pour la vie je promets de t'aimer
Wa Wa Wa Wa Waterloo
Il est arrivÃ© mon Waterloo

Pourtant, j'ai bien tentÃ© de rÃ©sister mais en vain
Alors, je crois que ma seule chance est d'abandonner
Le combat
Comment faire encore pour y croire
Quand je souhaite ta victoire

Waterloo - tu es vainqueur et je perds la guerre
Waterloo - je me constitue ta prisioniÃ¨re
Waterloo - je ne peux plus fuir et plus t'Ã©chapper
Waterloo - pour la vie je promets de t'aimer
Wa Wa Wa Wa Waterloo
Il est arrivÃ© mon Waterloo

Comment faire encore pour y croire
Quand je souhaite ta victoire
