// Ring Ring //

I was sitting by the phone
I was waiting all alone
Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you
It's a dark and dreary night
Seems like nothing's going right
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?

Yes I'm down and feeling blue
And I don't know what to do, oh-oh

Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

You were here and now you're gone
Hey did I do something wrong?
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking

Please forgive and then forget
Or maybe darling better yet, oh-oh

Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Oh-oh, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

// Another Town, Another Train //

Day is dawning and I must go
You're asleep but still I'm sure you'll know
Why it had to end this way
You and I had a groovy time
But I told you somewhere down the line
You would have to find me gone
I just have to move along
Just another town, another train
Waiting in the morning rain
Lord give my restless soul a little patience
Just another town, another train
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations

When you wake I know you'll cry
And the words I wrote to say goodbye
They won't comfort you at all
But in time you will understand
That the dreams we dreamed were made of sand
For a no-good bum like me
To live is to be free

Just another town, another train
Waiting in the morning rain
Look in my restless soul, a little patience
Just another town, another train
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations
Guess I will spend my life in railway stations

// Disillusion //

Changing, moving, in a circle
I can see your face in all of my dreams
Smiling, laughing, from the shadows
When I hear your voice I know what it means
I know it doesn't matter just how hard I try
You're all the reason for my life
Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me

How can I forget you when my world is breaking down
You're all I had, you're all I want
Disillusion, disillusions now, that's all I have

Wishing, hoping, chasing shadows
Did I see your face somewhere in the crowd
Thinking, wondering, what you're doing
I can stop myself from crying out loud
They say my wound will heal and only leave a scar
But then, they'd never shared our love
Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me

How can I forget you when my world is breaking down
You're all I had, you're all I want
Disillusion, disillusions now, that's all I have
Disillusion, disillusions now, that's all I have

// People Need Love //

People need hope, people need loving
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith and a helping hand

Man has always wanted a woman by his side to keep him company
Women always knew that it takes a man to get matrimonial harmony
Everybody knows that a man who's feeling down wants some female sympathy
Gotta have love to carry on living
Gotta have love 'till eternity

People need hope, people need loving
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand

La la la la, la la la la-la, la la la la la la la-la la la
La la la la, la la la la-la, la la la la la la la-la la laa...

Flowers in a desert need a drop of rain like a woman needs her man
If a man's in love and his woman wants the moon
Then he'll take it down if he can
Somebody who loves you and somebody who cares
Isn't that what you call a friend?
Gotta have love to carry on living
Isn't it easy to understand

People need hope, people need loving
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand

La la la la, la la la la-la, la la la la la la la-la la la
La la la la, la la la la-la, la la la la la la la-la la laa...

People need hope, people need loving
People need trust from a fellow man
People need love to make a good living
People need faith in a helping hand

La la la la, la la la la-la, la la la la la la la-la la la
La la la la, la la la la-la, la la la la la la la-la la laa...
La la la la, la la la la-la, la la la la la la la-la la la
La la la la, la la la la-la, la la la la la la la-la la laa...

// I Saw It In The Mirror //

I saw it in the mirror, I saw it in my face
That I'm no longer needed, anyone can take my place
I saw it in the mirror when I look into my eyes
'Cause something sure is wrong when this boy cries
(This boy cries)

I saw it in the mirror, my head is hanging low
And I ain't too familiar with the feelings that I show
I know you say you love me, but I'm seeing through your lies
It doesn't really bother you if this boy cries
(This boy cries)

I never thought I could cry for you
But honey I will miss you 'til the day I die
('Til the day I die)

I saw it in the mirror, I saw it in my face
That I'm no longer needed, anyone can take my place
I saw it in the mirror when I look into my eyes
'Cause something sure is wrong when this boy cries
(This boy cries, this boy cries)

// Nina, Pretty Ballerina //

Every day in the morning on her way to the office
You can see as she catches a train
Just a face among a million faces
Just another woman with no name
Not the girl you'd remember but she's still something special
If you knew her I am sure you'd agree
'Cause I know she's got a little secret
Friday evening she turns out to be...

Nina, pretty ballerina
Now she is the queen of the dancing floor
This is the moment she's waited for
Just like Cinderella
(just like Cinderella)
Nina, pretty ballerina
Who would ever think she could be this way
This is the part that she likes to play
But she knows the fun would go away
If she would play it every day

So she's back every morning to her work at the office
And another week to live in a dream
And another row of early mornings
In an almost never-ending stream
Doesn't talk very often, kind of shy and uncertain
Everybody seems to think she's a bore
But they wouldn't know her little secret
What her Friday night would have in store...

Nina, pretty ballerina
Now she is the queen of the dancing floor
This is the moment she's waited for
Just like Cinderella
(just like Cinderella)
Nina, pretty ballerina
Who would ever think she could be this way
This is the part that she likes to play
She would like to play it every day

Nina, pretty ballerina
Now she is the queen of the dancing floor
This is the moment she's waited for
Just like Cinderella
(just like Cinderella)
Nina, pretty ballerina
Who would ever think she could be this way
This is the part that she likes to play

// Love Isn't Easy (But It Sure Is Hard Enough) //

Do you remember the first time, and all of your sweet sweet talk
Ain't heard it a lot since then love
Now look at that guy, he's making me cry
He leaves everybody and he only says goodbye
But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow
Darling I know

We gotta have patience
Love isn't just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)
Giving love is a reason for living
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)

From the first moment I saw you I've treated you like a queen
I've given you lots of presents
Now listen to that, just look at that cat
You'd think he was an angel but he's talking through his hat
But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow
Darling I know

We gotta have patience
Love isn't just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)
Giving
(Sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)
Love is a reason for living
(Sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)

Patience
(Sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)
Love isn't just a sensation
(Sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)
Giving
(Sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)
Love is a reason for living
(Sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough

// Me And Bobby And Bobby's Brother //

Well there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days

I remember all the games we used to play
I really do
And I went to see them almost every day
I wanted to
Though we quarrelled at times
And had a few fights
We were the best of friends
We found a place in the sun
To have enough fun

Well there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Wildest kids you could see
We would play together
Climbing the apple tree
Yes there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all me my memories, those were my happiest days

They would take me out for football games and such
They liked to play
And I guess I didn't like it very much
But anyway
I was happy and proud to be with the boys
Being a little girl
I found a place in the sun
To have enough fun

Well there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Wildest kids you could see
We would play together
Climbing the apple tree
Yes there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all me my memories, those were my happiest days

Well there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days
(Got all my memories, those were my happiest days)
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days
(Got all my memories, those were my happiest days)
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days
(Got all my memories, those were my happiest days)

// He Is Your Brother //

I was a fighter always looking for trouble
And my life was so empty, there was nothing left to live for
But then it happened one night as I got into a fight
I could hear someone saying as though he was praying
Ah-a-ah-a-a-a-ah-ah

Treat him well, he is your brother
You might need his help some day
We depend on one another
Love him, that's the only way
On the road (on the road) that we're going
We all need (we all need) words of comfort and compassion
Treat him well, he is your brother
Love him, that's the only way

I was a woman never thinking of others
And my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody
But then I happened to meet a begging man in the street
As I turned down his praying I heard someone saying
Ah-a-ah-a-a-a-ah-ah

Treat him well, he is your brother (brother)
You might need his help one day (he's your brother)
We depend on one another (brother)
Love him, that's the only way
On the road (on the road) that we're going (that we're going)
We all need (we all need) words of comfort and compassion
Treat him well, he is your brother (brother)
Love him, that's the only way.

Treat him well, he is your brother (brother)
You might need his help one day (he's your brother)
We depend on one another (brother)
Love him, that's the only way

// She's My Kind Of Girl //

Look at her face, it's a wonderful face
And it means something special to me
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me
How lucky can one fellow be?

She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she would be mine?
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

And when we go for a walk in the park
And she holds me and squeezes my hand
We'll go on walking for hours and talking
About all the things that we plan

She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she would be mine?
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she would be mine?
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do?

She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine
Who could ever believe that she would be mine?
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do?

// I Am Just A Girl //

I am just a girl, one among the others, nothing much to say
Plain and simple girl, not a special type in any way
Just one look, and you will surely see
That the true "Miss Nobody" is me
It's an evil world that has only made me a girl

I am just a girl, not the kind of woman men would like to meet
Just another girl no-one ever looks at in the street
But today, I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered "I love you"
Darling I could see, I was meant to be your girl

It's a funny feeling when you get to love someone
And thinking that he'll never look your way
But then he says he loves you, and life has just begun
It's so much more than any words can say

I am just a girl, not the kind of woman men would like to meet
Just another girl no-one ever looks at in the street
But today, I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered "I love you"
Darling I could see, I was meant to be your girl

La la la la la, la la la la la-la, la la la la laaa
La la la la la, la la la la la-la, la la laaa
But today, I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered "I love you"
Darling I could see, I was meant to be your girl

// Rock 'n Roll Band //

Sitting in the darkest corner
In the tender light I saw her face
She was looking so sad and lonely
Someone help me, someone save me
I could see the look she gave me, oh
Oh yeah, and there was one thing only
That I knew I could do

Let's go girl
It's a beautiful place this world
Come on baby let's dance
To the rock'n'roll band
Let's go now
Let me show you that I know how
Come on baby let's dance
To the rock'n roll band
Come on baby let's dance
To the rock'n roll band
You'd been sitting there for hours
Try to hide behind the flowers now
Baby, we could have fun together
Come on, cheer up, let's get started
No use being broken-hearted now
Oh yeah, you're gonna feel much better
Yes I know that you will

Let's go girl
It's a beautiful place this world
Come on baby let's dance
To the rock'n roll band
Let's go now
Let me show you that I know how
Come on baby let's dance
To the rock'n roll band
Come on baby let's dance
To the rock'n roll band

// Merry-Go-Round //

I have tried in vain never had success
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess
I have lost my only friend
Now it seems I have to start again

Merry-go-round
Where am I bound
With my love and feelings
Merry-go-round
Who wants to kiss me
And hug me and miss me
Yes, who wants to do it
I wish that I knew it
Merry-go-round
Wish I had found
Somebody to care for
Where am I bound
Life is so lonely
If life is just only
To love with my loving
Goes round and round

Looking for someone
Who would want to stay
I might find her
With a bit of luck one day
But who knows
So until then
I can only try and try again

Merry-go-round
Where am I bound
With my love and feelings
Merry-go-round
Who wants to kiss me
And hug me and miss me
Yes, who wants to do it
I wish that I knew it
Merry-go-round
Wish I had found
Somebody to care for
Where am I bound
Life is so lonely
If life is just only
To love with my loving
Goes round and round

Merry-go-round
Where am I bound
With my love and feelings
Merry-go-round
Who wants to kiss me
And hug me and miss me
Yes, who wants to do it
I wish that I knew it
Merry-go-round
Wish I had found
Somebody to care for
Where am I bound
Life is so lonely
If life is just only
To love with my loving
Goes round and round

// Santa Rosa //

I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
How I wish this road would take me home where I belong
'Cause I have found no other place where I will stay
I'm tired and all my dreams have failed along the way

I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
Though I wonder what my folks would think about me now
I guess I've changed, like people do, when things go wrong
But in the end, somehow I know, we'll get along

Santa Rosa I'll be back to stay
I'm on my way
Santa Rosa I'll be back to stay

I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
How I wish to see the old house where I used to live
And all my friends, will they be there, when I come home
How I regret the day when I set out to roam

Santa Rosa I'll be back to stay
I'm on my way
Santa Rosa I'll be back to stay
I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa
I'd give anything to be back home in Santa Rosa

// Ring, Ring (Bara du slog en signal) //

Tyst och dÃ¶d Ã¤r telefon
StÃ¥r dÃ¤r nÃ¤stan som ett hÃ¥n
Inte ringer du och sÃ¤ger "Ãlsklig" nu som du gjorde
Allting Ã¤r sÃ¥ tyst mot fÃ¶rr
Ingen knackar pÃ¥ min dÃ¶rr
Det som lockat mig frestar inte, nej, som det borde
Inget roar mig just nu
Ingen annan bara du! Ã¥h

Ring ring! Bara du slog en signal
Ring ring! Tystnaden Ã¤r sÃ¥ total
Ring ring! Skingra den oron som mal
Om jag fick en signal, tog jag ett sprÃ¥ng
HjÃ¤rtat gjorde en volt, ding-dong bing-bong!
Om du ring-ring-ringde en endaste gÃ¥ng!
Om du ring-ring-ringde en endaste gÃ¥ng!

Att en telefon kan va'
Lika tyst varenda dag
Om det vore sÃ¥, det var nÃ¥t fel Ã¤ndÃ¥, men desvÃ¤rre...
Om den bara sa ett knyst
Om den inte blott var tyst
Om jag fick nÃ¥n lÃ¶n fÃ¶r nÃ¥n enda bÃ¶n av vÃ¥ Herre!
Inget roar mig just nu
Ingen annan bara du! Ã¥h

Ring ring! Bara du slog en signal
Ring ring! Tystnaden Ã¤r sÃ¥ total
Ring ring! Skingra den oron som mal
Om jag fick en signal, tog jag ett sprÃ¥ng
HjÃ¤rtat gjorde en volt, ding-dong bing-bong!
Om du ring-ring-ringde en endaste gÃ¥ng!
