// Horchata //

In December, drinking horchata
I'd look psychotic in a balaclava
Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals

In December, drinking horchata
Look down your glasses at that Aranciata
With lips and teeth to ask how my day went
Boots and fists to pound on the pavement

Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on

You'd remember drinking horchata
You'd still enjoy it with your foot on Masada
Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals

Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
Oh, you had it but oh, no, you lost it
Looking back, you shouldn't have fought it

In December, drinking horchata
I'd look psychotic in a balaclava
Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs that pinch at your sandals
Years go by and hearts start to harden
Those palms and firs that grew in your garden
Are falling down and nearing the rose beds
The roots are shooting up through the tool shed
Those lips and teeth that asked how my day went
Are shouting up through cracks in the pavement

Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
Oh, you had it but oh, no, you lost it
You understood so you shouldn't have fought it
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on

// White Sky //

An ancient business, a modern piece of glasswork
Down on the corner that you walk each day in passing
The elderly sales clerk won't eye us with suspicion
The whole, immortal corporation's given its permission

A little stairway, a little piece of carpet
A pair of mirrors that are facing one another
Out in both directions, a thousand little Julias
That come together in the middle of Manhattan

You waited since lunch
It all comes at once

Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Around the corner, the house that modern art built
A house for modern art to keep it out the closets
The people who might own it, the sins of pride and envy
And on the second floor, the Richard Serra Skate Park

You waited since lunch
It all comes at once

Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Sit on the park wall, ask all the right questions
"Why are the horses racing taxis in the winter?"
Look up at the buildings, imagine who might live there
Imagining your wolfords in a ball upon the sink there

You waited since lunch
It all comes at once

Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

// Holiday //

Holiday, oh, a holiday
And the best one of the year
Dozing off underneath my sheets
While I cover both my ears

But if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear

Holiday, still so far away
Our republic on the beach
I can't forget just how bad it gets
When I'm counting on my teeth

But if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear

A vegetarian since the invasion
She'd never seen the word 'bombs'
She'd never seen the word 'bombs'
Blown up to 96-point Futura
She'd never seen an AK
In a yellowy Day-Glo display
A T-shirt so lovely, it turned all the history books grey

I got wheels, I got Cutter spray
And a healthy sense of worth
Half of me is the gasoline
But the other half's the surf

So if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fear?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear

// California English //

Wouldn't ever gag you with a spoon, my only true love
Never really heard you speak that way, it's unworthy of
Funny how that little college girl called language corrupt
Funny how the other private schools had no Hapa Club
Someone took a trip before you came to ski in the Alps
Your father moved across the country just to sunburn his scalp
Contra Costa, Contra Mundum, contradict what I say
Living like the French Connection, but we'll die in LA

Blasted from a disconnected light switch
Through the condo that they'll never finish
Bounced across a Saudi satellite dish
And through your brain to California English

No one sits inside a freezing flat and stays there 'til May
Leafing through a stack of A-Zs to surf the UK
Waiting with the wind against your face and gel in your hair
Shivering in little undershirts, but don't seem to care

Blasted from a disconnected light switch
Through the condo that they'll never finish
Bounced across a Saudi satellite dish
And through your brain to California English

Sweet carob rice cake, she don't care how the sweets taste
Fake Philly cheese steak but she use real toothpaste
'Cause if that Tom's don't work, if it just makes you worse
Would you lose all of your faith in the good earth?
And if it's all a curse, and we're just getting worse
Baby, please don't lose your faith in the good earth

Blasted from a disconnected light switch
Through the condo that they'll never finish
Bounced across a Saudi satellite dish
And through your brain to California English
Blasted from a disconnected light switch
Through the condo that they'll never finish
Bounced across a Saudi satellite dish
And through your brain to California English

// Taxi Cab //

Unsentimental, traveling around
Sure of myself, sure of it now
But you were standing there so close to me
Like the future was supposed to be
In the aisles of the grocery
And the blocks uptown
I remember, remember it well
But if I'd forgotten, could you tell?
In the shadow of your first attack
I was questioning and looking back
You said, "Baby, we don't speak of that"
Like a real aristocrat

Compound to compound, lazy and safe
Wanted to leave it, wanted to wait
When the taxi door was open wide
I pretended I was horrified
By the uniform and gloves outside
Of the courtyard gate
You're not a victim, but neither am I
Nostalgic for garbage, desperate for time
I could blame it on your mother's hair
Or the colors that your father wears
But I know that I was never fair
You were always fine

Unsentimental, traveling around
Sure of myself, sure of it now
You were standing there so close to me
Like the future was supposed to be
In the aisles of the grocery
And the blocks uptown
I remember, remember it well
And if I'd forgotten, could you tell?
In the shadow of your first attack
I was questioning and looking back
You were standing on another track
Like a real aristocrat

// Run //

Every dollar counts
And every morning hurts
We mostly work to live
Until we live to work

She said
"You know
There's nowhere else to go"
But changing roles
It struck me that the two of us could run

Worlds away from cars
And all the Stars and Bars
Where a little bit of condensation means so much
And a little bit of change is all your little fingers touch

I said
"You know
There's nowhere else to go"
But changing roles
It struck me that the two of us could run

'Cause, honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
Is the only honest way to go
And I could take two-ooh-ooh-ooh
But I really couldn't ever know
Honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
And a little Bata radio
We could try

So lead my feet away
'Cause all they do is stay
And I don't think your eyes
Have ever looked surprised

She said
"You know
There's nowhere left to go"
But with
Her fund
It struck me that the two of us could run

'Cause, honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
Is the only honest way to go
And I could take two-ooh-ooh-ooh
If I really couldn't ever know
Honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
And a Bata radio
We could try, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Ayy ayy oh ah, ayy ayy oh ah, ayy ayy oh ah, ayy ayy ayy
Ayy ayy oh ah, ayy ayy oh ah, ayy ayy oh ah, ayy ayy ayy

You found a sweater on the ocean floor
They're gonna find it if you didn't close the door
You and the smart ones sit outside of their sight
In a house on a street they wouldn't park on at night
Dad was a risk-taker, his was a shoe maker
You, "Greatest Hits 2006" little list-maker
Heard codes in the melodies, you heeded the call
Oh, you were born with ten fingers and you're gonna use them all

Interesting colors I discovered myself
If your art life is gritty, you'll be toasting my health
If an interest in culture should be lining the walls
When your birthright is interest, you could just accrue it all

Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
It's a line that's always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming

You could turn your back on the bitter world
You could turn your back on the bitter world
You could turn your back on the bitter world
You could turn your back on the bitter world

Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
It's a line that's always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
It's a line that's always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming

// Giving Up The Gun //

Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done

And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun

When I was 17
I had wrists like steel
And I felt complete

And now my body fades
Behind a brass charade
And I'm obsolete

But if the chance remained
To see those better days
I'd cut the cannons down

My ears are blown to bits
From all the rifle hits
But still I crave that sound

Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done

And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun

I heard you play guitar
Down at a seedy bar
Where skinheads used to fight

Your Tokugawa smile
And your garbage style
Used to save the night

You felt the coming wave
Told me we'd all be brave
You said you wouldn't flinch

But in the years that passed
Since I saw you last
You haven't moved an inch

Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done

And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun

I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on

Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done

And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun

// Diplomat's Son //

[Ezra Koenig:]
It's not right, but it's now or never
And if I wait, could I ever forgive myself?
On a night when the moon glows yellow in the riptide
With the light from the TV's buzzing in the house

'Cause I'm gonna cut it where I can
And then I'm gonna duck out behind them
If I ever had a chance, it's now then
But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you
To offer it to you would be cruel
When all I want to do is use, use you

He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Dressed in white with my car keys hidden in the kitchen
I could sleep wherever I lay my head
And the sight of your two shoes sitting in the bathtub
Let me know that I shouldn't give up just yet

'Cause I'm gonna take it from Simon
And then I'm gonna duck out behind them
If I ever had a chance, it's now then
But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you
To offer it to you would be cruel
When all I want to do is use, use you

He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Rostam Batmanglij:]
I know, you'll say I'm not doing it right
But this is how I want it
I can't go back to how I felt before
There'sâ

[Ezra Koenig:]
That night I smoked a joint with my best friend
We found ourselves in bed, when I woke up, he was gone

He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81

Looking out at the ice cold water all around me
I can't feel any traces of that other place
In the dark, when the wind comes racing off the river
There's a car, all black with diplomatic plates

// I Think Ur A Contra //

I had a feeling once
That you and I
Could tell each other everything
For two months
But even with our oath
With truth on our side
When you turn away from me
It's not right

I think you're a contra
I think you're a contra
I think you're a contra
I think you're a contra

My revolution thoughts
Your little arrows of desire
I want to trace them to the source
And the wire
But it's not useful now
Since we've both made up our minds
You're going to watch out for yourself
And so will I

I think you're a contra
And I think that you've lied
Don't call me a contra
'Til you've tried

You wanted good schools and friends with pools
You're not a contra
You wanted rock and roll, complete control
Well, I don't know

Never pick sides
Never choose between two
Well, I just wanted you
I just wanted you
You said, "Never pick sides
Never choose between two"
Well, I just wanted you
I just wanted you

I think you're a contra
And I think that you've lied
Don't call me a contra
'Til you've tried

// Giant //

It was all a dream
I used to read Thrasher Magazine
Looking at pictures of skateboarders
California

So envy me, S.O.S. L.A.P.D
Docking the yacht in such low waters
Alessandra

Now it's a different game
80 percent still agree
The winning cause, it pleases God
The losing cause pleases me

At the duty-free
Gifts of wine and Hennessy
Beautifully made from such fine water
Robert Smithson

In an ancient scene
Spiral Jetty, favorite cheese
Leaving the rocks in such blind slaughter
Coliseum

Now it's a different game
80 percent still agree
The winning cause, it pleases God
But the losing cause pleases me

Now it's a different game
80 percent still agree
The winning cause, it pleases God
But the losing cause pleases me

// California English: Part 2 //

Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh

This girl wrote drug raps in baggy sweaters
Tight neon tights, T-shirts and big letters
Back at her house was an Irish setter
With a heart-shaped tag hanging off its collar
Through half the towns of Arizona
I dream the dreams I have when I hold her
Near Palm Springs, we were struck by boulders
'Cause they looked like skull and bones

Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh

Questions I had as I went through this:
Are our parents actually Buddhist?
Is the pool below me the bluest?
Is the TV on?
Through half the Taquerias y Fondas
Half the health clubs, half of the saunas
Half the Barbaras, half of the Rhondas
Is there something there?

Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh

This girl was smarter than television scripts
This girl wasn't damaged, her jeans were just ripped
This girl was the girl that the girls in your world thought about
When the night was cold
How many towns have claimed that they know you?
How many nations think that they own you?
How many simple minds think the same sun
Don't shine on their sunglasses now?

Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
