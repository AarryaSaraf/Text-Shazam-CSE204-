// Hold You Now //

[Ezra Koenig:]
I know the reason why you think you gotta leave
Promises of future glory don't make a case for me
I did my best and all the rest is hidden by the clouds
I can't carry you forever, but I can hold you now

Leaving on your wedding day, all calm and dressed in white
All I'll keep's the memory of one last crooked night
The pews are getting filled up, the organ's playing loud
I can't carry you forever, but I can hold you now
Alright

[Choir of All Saints:]
God, yu tekem laef blong mi
Mi mi givim nao long yu
Mbae mi givim evride
Blong leftemap nem blong yu

[Danielle Haim:]
I know the reason why you think I oughta stay
Funny how you're telling me on my wedding day
Crying in those rumpled sheets like someone's 'bout to die
You just watch your mouth when talking 'bout the father of the bride

Why's your heart grown heavy, boy, when things were feeling light?
Turning this June morning into some dark judgment night
This ain't the end of nothing much, it's just another round
I can't carry you forever, but I can hold you now

[Choir of All Saints:]
God, yu tekem laef blong mi
Mi mi givim nao long yu
Mbae mi givim evride
Blong leftemap nem blong yu

[Ezra Koenig:]
Alright

// Harmony Hall //

We took a vow in summertime
Now we find ourselves in late December
I believe that New Year's Eve
Will be the perfect time for their great surrender
But they don't remember

Anger wants a voice, voices wanna sing
Singers harmonize 'til they can't hear anything
I thought that I was free from all that questionin'
But every time a problem ends, another one begins

And the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness
Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

Within the halls of power lies a nervous heart that beats
Like a Young Pretender's
Beneath these velvet gloves I hide
The shameful, crooked hands of a moneylender
'Cause I still remember

Anger wants a voice, voices wanna sing
Singers harmonize 'til they can't hear anything
I thought that I was free from all that questionin'
But every time a problem ends, another one begins

And the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness
Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

And the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness
Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

And the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness
Anybody with a worried mind could never forgive the sight
Of wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified
I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die

// Bambina //

[Ezra Koenig:]
No time to discuss it
Can't speak when the waves reach our house upon the dunes
Time cannot be trusted
When the police come, they always come too soon
Life felt like heaven today
Like a foreign car though we are American-made
I thought I'd probably stay
But before I know, I know

My Christian heart cannot withstand
The thundering arena
I'll see you when the violence ends
For now, ciao ciao, Bambina

No signs of injustice
No signs, but the flames that are filling up the room
Fire cannot be trusted
When the engines come, they always come too soon

My Christian heart cannot withstand
The thundering arena
I'll see you when the violence ends
For now, ciao ciao, Bambina
My Christian heart cannot withstand
The thundering arena
I'll see you when the violence ends
For now, ciao ciao, Bambina

[Ariel Rechtshaid:]
Uh, to an extent, yeah

// This Life //

Baby, I know pain is as natural as the rain
I just thought it didn't rain in California
Baby, I know love isn't what I thought it was
'Cause I've never known a love like this before ya
Baby, I know dreams tend to crumble at extremes
I just thought our dream would last a little bit longer
There's a time when every man draws a line down in the sand
We're surviving, we're still living, are we stronger?

You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I've been cheating through this life
And all its suffering
Oh Christ
Am I good for nothing?

Baby, I know hate is always waiting at the gate
I just thought we locked the gate when we left in the morning
And I was told that war is how we landed on these shores
I just thought the drums of war beat louder warnings

You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I've been cheating through this life
(You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
And all its suffering (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)
Oh Christ (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
Am I good for nothing? (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)

Baby, I know death probably hasn't happened yet
'Cause I don't remember living life before this
And darling, our disease is the same one as the trees
Unaware that they've been living in a forest

You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you
You've been cheating on me
But I've been cheating through this life
(You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
And all its suffering (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)
Oh Christ (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
Am I good for nothing? (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)
This life (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
And all its suffering (You've been cheating on me
I've been cheating through)
Oh Christ (You've been cheating on, cheating on me
I've been cheating on, cheating on you)
Am I good for nothing?

// Big Blue //

Big blue, for once in my life I felt close to you
I was so overcome with emotion
When I was hurt and in need of affection
When I was tired and I couldn't go home
Then you offered protection
So am I learning my lesson?
Or am I back on my own?

// How Long? //

Tough choice? Don't make me laugh
My life's a joke, your life's a gas
You broke my heart at midnight mass
Now I'm the ghost of Christmas past
The only choice you gave to me
Is one I took reluctantly
'Cause when we play democracy
You always take immunity

How long 'til we sink to the bottom of the sea?
How long, how long?
How long 'til we sink and it's only you and me?
How long, how long?

How long? (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la-la)

What's the point of getting clean?
You'll wear the same old dirty jeans
What's the point of being seen?
Those eyes are cruel, those eyes are mean
What's the point of human beings?
A Sharpie face on tangerines
Why's it felt like Halloween since Christmas 2017?

How long?
How long, how long?
How long 'til we sink and it's only you and me?
How long, how long?

How long? (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la-la)

Getting to the top
Wasn't supposed to be this hard
The house is on Mulholland Drive
The car's on Sunset Boulevard
The registration's here with me
Neither of us has the key
We can live down in the flats
The hills will fall eventually

How long 'til we sink to the bottom of the sea?
How long, how long?
How long 'til we sink and it's only you and me?
How long, how long?

How long? (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
How long? (La-la-la-la)

How long 'til we sink to the bottom of the sea?
How long, how long?

// Unbearably White //

Baby, I love you, but that's not enough
And pulling away has been unbearably buff
I ran up the mountain, out of your sight
The snow on the peak was just unbearably white

The city was freezing, an elegant floe
The wind at the doorway was unbearably cold
You walked to the bedroom and sat down to write
The page in your notebook was unbearably white

There's an avalanche coming
Don't cover your eyes
It's what you thought that you wanted
It's still a surprise
It's hard on the body
It's hard on the mind
To learn what kept us together, darling
Is what kept us alive

Sooner or later, the story gets told
To tell it myself would be unbearably bold
Presented with darkness, we turn to the light
Could've been smart, we're just unbearably bright

There's an avalanche coming
Don't cover your eyes
It's what you thought that you wanted
It's still a surprise
It's hard on the body
It's hard on the mind
To learn what kept us together, darling
Is what kept us alive

Call it a day, call it a night
Callous and cold and just unbearably white
Call it a day, call it a night
Callous and cold and just unbearably white
Call it a day, call it a night
Callous and cold and just unbearably white

Baby, I love you, but that's not enough
And pulling away has been unbearably buff
I ran up the mountain, out of your sight
The snow on the peak was just unbearably white

Call it a day, call it a night
Callous and cold and just unbearably white
Call it a day, call it a night

// Rich Man //

When I was young, I was told I'd find
One rich man in ten has a satisfied mind
And I'm the one

A hundred to one says I wouldn't react
But I'm the one in a hundred who would swing right back
Yes, I'm the one

Thousands of steps and staircases to climb
Thousands of men you'd most likely decline
And yet I'm the one

Ten thousand to one, could I possibly bet?
I'm compelled by your love and I haven't lost yet
Clearly, you're the one

One in a million don't mean what it meant
And these millions of gold coins don't gleam when they're spent
You're left with none

Ten million dollars could win the whole lot
But if ten million dollars is all that you got
You won't be the one

Hundreds of millions of papers to sign
Hundreds of millions of souls left behind
And yet, we're the ones

A billion to one, don't the odds make you sick?
To be one in a billion's a terrible trick
You're the wretched one

When I was young, I was told I'd find
One rich man in ten has a satisfied mind
And I'm the one

// Married In A Gold Rush //

[Ezra Koenig:]
Something's happening in the country
And the government's to blame
We got married in a gold rush
And the rush has never felt the same

[Danielle Haim:]
Shared a moment in a cafÃ©
Shared a kiss in pouring rain
We got married in a gold rush
And the sight of gold will always bring me pain

[Ezra Koenig (Danielle Haim):]
I don't wanna hear the rumors, please don't say it loud
I just wanna go out tonight and make my baby proud
(Boy, who's your baby?)
Girl, if you don't know by now
There's two seats on the midnight train
The gold won't weigh us down

[Ezra Koenig (Danielle Haim) {Both}:]
Hanging gardens turned to desert
(All that loving turned to hate)

[Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim:]
We got married in a gold rush
And those wedding bells were ringing out our fate

[Ezra Koenig (Danielle Haim) {Both}:]
I don't wanna hear the rumours, please don't say it loud
I just wanna go out tonight and make my baby proud
(Boy, who's your baby?)
Girl, if you don't know by now
{There's two seats on the midnight train}
{The gold won't weigh us down}

The rush is on to somewhere else, we're running out of time
Everything was ours, now it's just an empty mine
(Animals don't understand the words on the danger sign)
(For them, it's just some shade from the morning shine)
I thought you might learn the language
(I thought you might learn to sing)
{We were born before the gold rush}
{So why can't I remember anything?}
I want to put things back together
(I wanna give, don't wanna take)
Time to disavow the gold rush
{And the bitterness that's flourished in its wake}

I don't wanna hear the rumours, please don't say it loud
(Please don't say it loud)
I just wanna go out tonight {and make my baby proud}
(Boy, who's your baby?)
Girl, if you don't know by now
{There's two seats on the midnight train}
{The gold won't weigh us down}
I don't wanna hear the rumours, please don't say it loud
(Please don't say it loud)
I just wanna go out tonight {and make my baby proud}
(Boy, who's your baby?)
Girl, if you don't know by now
{There's two seats on the midnight train}
{The gold won't weigh us down}

// My Mistake //

Skin under sun
Summer breeze
Summer break

Oh, I was young then
Hadn't made
My mistake

Unaware of the fall
Unaware of my fate

There was peace in the valley
'Til I made my mistake

Quick in the night
As the storm took its shape

Caught at the border

As I made my escape

It was cold
It was dark
You were cruel
You were fake

Hoping for kindness
Was my greatest mistake

I was young then
Hadn't made my mistake

There was choice to get out
Or remain in this state

There was springtime and future
'Til I made my mistake

Quick in the night
As the storm took its shape

Caught at the border

As I made my escape
It was cold, it was dark
I was foolish and lame
Hoping for kindness
Was my greatest mistake

// Sympathy //

I think I take myself too serious
It's not that serious

Alone in someone's bedroom, she firmly took my hand
The isolation ended, I began to understand
In the ping-pong match of constant desire
I was never gonna get ahead
'Cause I was looking in the mirror

Now we've got that sympathy
What I'm to you, you are to me
Let's go

Judeo-Christianity, I'd never heard the words
Enemies for centuries, until there was a third
In the ping-pong match of constant desire
I was never gonna get ahead
'Cause I was looking in the mirror

Now we've got that sympathy
What I'm to you, you are to me
Let's go

Diego Garcia, surrounded by the waves
Lonely in the ocean, but in every other way
It was full of love
In the warmest fellow-feeling

Now we've got that sympathy
What I'm to you, you are to me
Let's go

I didn't have your sympathy, but I knew where to start
Explaining to you patiently that the one who broke my heart
Would have broken yours
And thrown the pieces in the river

Now we've got that sympathy
What I'm to you, you are to me
Let's go

Sympaâ
Sympaâ
Let's go
Sympaâ
Let's go
Sympaâ
Let's go
Sympaâ

Desperate for an enemy, but too afraid to kill
Use the pain of someone else and triumph for their will
And spill the blood
Of the arrogant mosquitoes

Now we've got that sympathy
What I'm to you, you are to me
Let's go

// Sunflower //

Sunflower in the morning
Standing in the garden
All before you wake
No power can compel you
Out into the daylight
Let that evil wait

Strange thought upon the pillow
"What day demands a date?"
Well, I don't know

Sunflower in the evening
Standing in the garden
Taking up that space
No power can compel me
Back into the daylight
Let that evil wait

Strange thought upon the pillow
"What day demands a date?"
Well, I don't know

You know

// Flower Moon //

[Ezra Koenig (Steve Lacy):]
Flower moon cursed the night
If the sun don't make things right
Then it's gonna take a year
(Gonna take a year)
Flower moon, sacred sign
Coca-Cola and red wine
Now's the time to disappear
(Gonna take a year)

[Steve Lacy:]
It was the right place, wrong time
Another night at the borderline
Another night in the sway of the flower moon
It was the right week on a cursed day
Another chapter was underway
Another year in the light of the flower moon

[Ezra Koenig & Steve Lacy:]
It was the right place, wrong time
Another night at the borderline
Another night in the sway of the flower moon
It was the right week on a cursed day
Another chapter was underway
Another year in the light of the flower moon

It was the right place, wrong time
Another night at the borderline
Another night in the sway of the flower moon
It was the right week on a cursed day
Another chapter was underway
Another year in the light of the flower moon

[Danielle Haim:]
A shift in weight
A simple twist of fate
Suddenly, it's much too late
The rising tide's already lapping at the gate

[Ezra Koenig (Steve Lacy):]
Flower moon cursed the night
If the sun don't make things right
Then it's gonna take a year
(Gonna take a year)
Flower moon, sacred sign
Coca-Cola and red wine
Now's the time to disappear
(Gonna take a year)

[Steve Lacy:]
Flower moon cursed the night
If the sun don't make things right
Then it's gonna take a year
Gonna take a year

// 2021 //

[Jenny Lewis:]
Boy, boy

[Ezra Koenig (Jenny Lewis):]
2021, will you think about me?
I could wait a year, but I shouldn't wait three (Boy)
I don't wanna be (Boy)
2021, will you think about us?
Copper goes green, steel beams go rust (Boy)
It's a matter of (Boy)

[Jenny Lewis:]
Boy, boy
Boy, boy

[Ezra Koenig (Jenny Lewis):]
2021, will you think about me?
I could wait a year, but I couldn't wait three (Boy)
I don't wanna be (Boy)
2021, will you think about us?
Copper goes green, steel beams go rust (Boy)
It's a matter of (Boy)

// We Belong Together //

[Ezra Koenig:]
We go together like sound and sight
Black and white, day and night
We go together like left and right
Oh, we go together

[Danielle Haim:]
We go together like give and take
Pains and aches, real and fake
We go together, don't be opaque
It's clear we go together

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim:]
We belong together (Can you say what you mean?)
We belong together (Can you mean what you say?)
Baby, there's no use in being clever (Can you mean what you say?)
Baby, it don't mean we'll stay together

[Ezra Koenig (Danielle Haim) {Both}:]
We go together like pots and pans
Surf and sand, bottles and cans
We go together like lions and lambs
Oh, we go together

(We go together like Keats and Yeats)
Bowls and plates, days and dates
{We stay united like these old states}
{It's how we go together}

[Ezra Koenig (Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim):]
We belong together
(We belong together)
(Baby, there's no use in being clever)
(Baby, it don't mean we'll stay together)

[Ezra Koenig:]
Hallelujah, you're still mine
All I did was waste your time
If there's not some grand design
How'd this pair of stars align?

// Stranger //

[Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim:]
I-I-I, things have never been stranger
I-I-I, things are gonna stay strange
I-I-I, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Darling

[Ezra Koenig:]
Another night indoors, another sign of life-ife
Wobbling up through the floor
You and Kidada
Ooh, I might get low, low, low
But now I'm too high to know
The sound of you and your sister
I couldn't face these days alone
You got the right light, candles burning
We don't need the moon anymore
I used to look for an answer
I used to knock on every door
But you got the wave on, music playing
Don't need to look anymore

[Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim:]
I-I-I, things have never been stranger
I-I-I, things are gonna stay strange
I-I-I, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change

[Ezra Koenig:]
You and Kidada
Ooh, the lights get low, low, low
And I got nowhere to go
I used to freeze on the dance floor
I watched the icebergs from the shore
But you got the heat on, kettle screaming
Don't need to freeze anymore
Ooh-ooh, darling
I might get

[Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim:]
I-I-I, things have never been stranger
I-I-I, things are gonna stay strange
I-I-I, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change

[Ezra Koenig:]
Who knows the reason that kindness lost its hold?
Those better angels confined to minor roles
I left the wilding, wilding, wilding days of old
Your house is warmer the wilderness is cold

[Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim:]
Things have never been stranger
Things are gonna stay strange
I-I-I, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change

[Ezra Koenig:]
Ooh
Things have never been stranger
Things are gonna stay strange
Oh, I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I, but things change

[Ezra Koenig & Danielle Haim:]
Ooh
Things have never been stranger (Ooh)
Things are gonna stay strange (Ooh)
I remember life as a stranger
I-I-I

// Spring Snow //

The snow fell last night
Your flight couldn't leave
Come back to the bed
Let's take this reprieve

It felt like the end
The end's been delayed
You're here in my arms
So what should I say?

The words of a song
The prayers that we pray
The lock on the door
Won't keep them away

The snow slows them down
If just for a day
But here comes the sun
Those toxic old rays

Trains start to move
Bells start to ring
The seasons we had
Don't mean anything

Trains start moving
Bells start to ring
The seasons we had
Don't mean anything

// Jerusalem, New York, Berlin //

I know I loved you then
I think I love you still
But this prophecy of ours
Has come back dressed to kill
Three stones on a mountain
Three small holes in a field
You've given me the big dream
But you can't make it real

O, wicked world
Just think what could have been
Jerusalem, New York, Berlin
All I do is lose but baby
All I want's to win
Jerusalem, New York, Berlin

A hundred years or more
It feels like such a dream
An endless conversation
Since 1917
Now the battery is too hot
It's burning up in its tray
Young marriages are melting
And dying where they lay

O, wicked world
Just think what could have been
Jerusalem, New York, Berlin
All I do is lose but baby
All I want's to win
Jerusalem, New York, Berlin

Our tongues will fall so still
Our teeth will all decay
A minute feels much longer
With nothing left to say
So let them win the battle
But don't let them restart
That genocidal feeling
That beats in every heart

O, wicked world
Just think what could have been
Jerusalem, New York, Berlin
All I do is lose but baby
All I want's to win
Jerusalem, New York, Berlin

// Houston, Dubai //

Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
The country's young
But the land is deep

Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
I just want to wake up
Where I went to sleep

As this old world keeps turning
Me through my fever dream
Houston just did ninety-nine
Dubai's one-eighteen

Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
The country's young
But the land is deep

Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
I just want to wake up
Where I went to sleep

I got a wife back home, you know
She always thinks I cheat
I think about those Denton days
When life was light and sweet

Every time I think I'm done
The plane keeps flying back
And every race beneath the sun
Just takes another lap

Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
The country's young
But the land is deep

Houston, Dubai
Dubai to Houston
I just want to wake up
Where I went to sleep

I know the price, I know the map
But don't know what it's worth
So let the thieves and killers
Take my treasure on the Earth

Houston, goodbye
Goodbye to Houston
The country's young
But the land is deep

Houston, goodbye
Goodbye to Houston
Now I'm gonna wake up
Where I went to sleep

// I Don't Think Much About Her No More //

I don't think much about her no more
Seldom if ever does she cross my mind
Yesterday's gone, Lord, it's better forgotten
Like the poison red berries to die on the vine
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

This mornin' at dawn, Lord, I pulled into town
Had some coffee and talked with some old friends of mine
Laughing at the good times they remembered
And then I remembered a time

Lord, I can see the bright lights back in Dallas
As yesterday moves like a dream through my mind
I didn't suppose that I'd ever forget her
And you know it took such a long time

But I don't think much about her no more
Seldom if ever does she cross my mind
Yesterday's gone and it's better forgotten
It's like a poison red berry that clings to the mind

// Lord Ullin's Daughter //

[Jude Law:]
A chieftain to the Highlands bound
Cries, "Boatman, do not tarry
And I'll give thee a silver pound
To row us o'er the ferry"

"Now who be ye would cross Lochgyle
This dark and stormy water?"
"O, I'm the chief of Ulva's isle
And this, Lord Ullin's daughter."

And fast before her father's men
Three days we've fled together
For should he find us in the glen
My blood would stain the heather

His horsemen, hard behind us ride
Should they our steps discover
Then who will cheer my bonny bride
When they have slain her lover?

Out spoke the hardy Highland wight
"I'll go, my chief, I'm ready"
It is not for your silver bright
But for your winsome lady

"And by my word, the bonny bird
In danger shall not tarry
So though the waves are raging white
I'll row you o'er the ferry"

By this the storm grew loud apace
The water-wraith was shrieking
And in the scowl of heaven, each face
Grew dark as they were speaking

But still, as wild blew the wind
And as the night grew drearer
Adown the glen rode armed men
Their trampling sounded nearer

"O haste thee, haste!" the lady cries
"Though tempests round us gather
I'll meet the raging of the skies
And not an angry father"

The boat has left a stormy land
A stormy sea before her
When, oh! Too strong for human hand
The tempest gathered o'er her

And still they rowed amidst the roar
Of waters fast prevailing
Lord Ullin reached that fatal shore
His wrath was changed to wailing

For sore dismayed, through storm and shade
His child, he did discover
One lovely hand she stretched for aid
And one was 'round her lover

"Come back! Come back!" he cried in grief
"Across this stormy water
And I'll forgive your Highland chief
My daughter! Oh, my daughter!"

'Twas vain, the loud waves lash'd the shore
Return or aid preventing
The waters wild went o'er his child
And he was left lamenting
