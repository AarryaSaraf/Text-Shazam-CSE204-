// Marry The Night //

I'm gonna marry the night, I won't give up on my life
I'm a warrior queen, live passionately tonight
I'm gonna marry the dark, gonna make love to the stark
I'm a soldier to my own emptiness, I'm a winner
I'm gonna marry the night, I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

Ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

I'm gonna lace up my boots, throw on some leather and cruise
Down the streets that I love, in my fishnet gloves, I'm a sinner
Then I'll go down to the bar, but I won't cry anymore
I'll hold my whiskey up high, kiss the bartender twice, I'm a loser
I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night

I'm gonna marry the night
I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm gonna marry the night
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

Ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night
Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

Nothing's too cool to take me from you
New York is not just a tan that you never lose
Love is the new denim or black
Skeleton guns are wedding bells in the attic
Get Ginger ready, climb to El Camino front
Won't poke holes in the seat with my heels
'Cause that's where we make love
Come on and run
Turn the car on and run

I'm gonna marry the night (The night)
I'm gonna burn a hole in the road
I'm gonna marry the night (The night)
Leave nothing on these streets to explore

Ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry (Marry)
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night (The night)
Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry (Marry, marry)
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night (The night)
Oh, ma-ma-ma-marry, ma-ma-ma-marry
Ma-ma-ma-marry the night

I'm gonna marry, marry
I'm gonna marry, marry
C'mon, c'mon
The night, the night, the night
(Gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna)
The night, the night, the night
(Gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna)
The night, the night, the night, the night
(Gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna)
The night, the night, the night, the night
(Gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna)
The night, the night, the night (Gonna, g-gonna, gonna, g-gonna)

// Born This Way //

It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital "H-I-M" (M, M, M)
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby

My mama told me when I was young
"We are all born superstars"
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (Born this way)

Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be (Don't be, don't be)

Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M, hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (Same DNA)

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (Born this way)

Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

(Way) Don't be, don't be
(Way) Church

Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Whether you're broke or evergreen
You're black, white, beige, cholo descent
You're Lebanese, you're orient
Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied, or teased
Rejoice and love yourself today
'Cause baby, you were born this way

No matter gay, straight, or bi
Lesbian, transgendered life
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to survive
No matter black, white, or beige
Chola or orient made
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to be brave!

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself, and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, yeah

Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, hey
Same DNA, but born this way (Hey, hey, hey)
Same DNA, but born this way (Hey, hey, hey)

// Judas //

Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga

When he calls to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
A king with no crown, king with no crown

I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga

I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his goofy way
I've learned love is like a brick
You can build a house or sink a dead body

(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
A king with no crown, king with no crown

I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Ew
In the most Biblical sense, I am beyond repentance
Fame hooker, prostitute, wench vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense, I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me, if offensed, or wear ear condom next time

I wanna love you
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue, and Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to

Just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby (Just a Holy Fool, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as (Juda-a-a-as)
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as (Juda-a-a-as)

Judas, Juda-ah-ah

I met a girl in East LA
In floral shorts as sweet as May
She sang in eights in two Barrio chords
We fell in love
But not in court

// Hair //

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, whoa
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, whoa

Whenever I'm dressed cool, my parents put up a fight
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And if I'm a hot shot, mom will cut my hair at night
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And in the morning, I'm short of my identity
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I scream, "Mom and Dad, why can't I be who I wanna be?"
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
To be

I just wanna be myself, and I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself, and I want you to know
I am my hair

I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fightin' to stay cool on these streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear
I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair
I am my hair

Free as my hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
As free as my hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair

Sometimes I want some raccoon or red highlights
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Just because I want my friends to think I'm dynamite
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And on Friday, Rock City High School dance
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I've got my bangs to hide that I don't stand a chance
(Uh-huh, uh-huh)
A chance (No)

I just wanna be myself, and I want you to love me for who I am
I just wanna be myself, and I want you to know
I am my hair

I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, this is my prayer
That I'll die living just as free as my hair
I've had enough, I'm not a freak
I just keep fightin' to stay cool on these streets
I've had enough, enough, enough
And this is my prayer, I swear
I'm as free as my hair
I'm as free as my hair
I am my hair
I am my hair

Free as my hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
As free as my hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair, hair, hair
Hair, hair, hair, hair

I just wanna be free, I just wanna be me
And I want lots of friends that invite me to their parties
Don't wanna change, and I don't wanna be ashamed
I'm the spirit of my hair
It's all the glory that I bare
I'm my hair, I am my hair
I'm my hair, I am my hair
I am my hair, I am my hair
I am my hair (Glory that I bare)
I'm my hair, I am my hair
It's all the glory that I bare
I'm my hair, I am my hair
I'm my hair, yeah, yeah (All the glory that I bare)

I grew up in New York City
Since I was born on Broadway, baby
Moved downtown when I was just nineteen
To start a new life on the New York scene

Was coming for your spot

Concrete poetry to feed my mind
Old symbolism was left behind

Was coming for your spot
I met a better man

// Bad Kids //

We don't care what people say, we know the truth
Enough is enough of this horse shit
I am not a freak, I was born with my free gun
Don't tell me I'm less than my freedom

I'm a bitch
I'm a loser, baby, maybe I should quit
I'm a jerk
Wish I had the money, but I can't find work
I'm a brat
I'm a selfish punk, I really should be smacked
My parents tried
'Til they got divorced 'cause I ruined their lives

I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
Oh, I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right (Know wrong from right)
I'm a bad kid, and this is my life, one of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right (This is my life)

Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure

I'm a twit
Degenerate, young rebel and I'm proud of it
Pump your fist if you would rather mess up than put up with this
I'm a nerd
I chew gum and smoke in your face, I'm absurd
I'm so bad
And I don't give a damn, I love it when you're mad
When you're mad, when you're mad

I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
Oh, I'm a bad kid
Don't know wrong from right (Know wrong from right)
I'm a bad kid, and this is my life, one of the bad kids
Don't know wrong from right (This is my life)

Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure

I'm not that typical baby
I'm a bad kid like my mom and dad made me
I'm not that "cool and you hate me"
I'm a bad kid, that's the way that they made me
I'm a bad kid, I'm disastrous
Give me your money or I'll hold my breath
I'm a bad kid, and I will survive
One of the bad kids don't know wrong from right

Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
Don't be insecure if your heart is pure
You're still good to me if you're a bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby
A bad kid, baby

A bad kid baby
A bad kid baby
A bad kid baby

// Fashion Of His Love //

I never was the kind of girl that's
Naturally sure when it comes to love, oh no
I was insecure
Insecure
But when it comes to you and me
I can't deny this feeling inside, oh no
I never felt like this before
This before, no, no, no

(Oh) I'm seeing all the signs from above
(Oh) I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
(Oh) 'Cause baby, I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love

You know that I'd never cheat on a man
'Cause I'm not like that
I'm physically crafted to be as fitting as McQueen
But when it comes to clothing, I'm bad
I'm fashionably just designed to be grand
Oh, and he's no accessory to me
-Ry to me, no, no, no!

No, I just can't seem to forget you
No, I can't for just as long as I met you
You're my babe right through
I was made for you

(Oh) I'm seeing all the signs from above
(Oh) I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love
Oh, yeah
(Oh) I'm gonna be his first and last kiss
(Oh) 'Cause baby, I was born to be his
I was made for loving him
The Fashion of His Love

They say I need a strong man, not just a friend
But baby, my search is done
No longer reason to cry or to justify
How I feel for you, my love

I'm seeing all the signs from above
I'm gonna be the one that he loves
I was made for loving him
Oh, yeah

(Oh) I'm seeing all the signs from above

To make a pure love work in a dirty way

// The Queen //

Oh, tonight I'm gonna show them what I'm made of, oh
The killer queen inside me's coming to say "hello"
Oh, tonight I will return
The fame and riches earned
With you, I'd watch them all be burned
Whoa, whoa

Whenever I start feeling strong
I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14 karat guns to win
I am a woman, I insist, it's my life

I can be the queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release
And be brave for you, you'll see
I can be, the queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
I've dreamed, it's happening
I can be the queen

I am wind and hurricane, the stormy sky and rain
When you run dry, I'll flood your pain
Whoa, whoa
In between the moments of the lady I've become
A voice speaks through the noise like drums
Rum-pum-pum-pum

Whenever I start feeling strong
I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14 karat guns to win
I am a woman, I insist, it's my life

I can be the queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release
And be brave for you, you'll see
I can be, the queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
I've dreamed, it's happening
I can be the queen
The que ee-ee-ee-ee ee-ee-eeen
The queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen
Queen, queen, queen

Starry night
Come inside me, like never before
Don't forget me when I come crying to Heaven's door
I will fly
On a challenger across the sky
Like a phoenix, so you can remind them of the dream I bore

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh

// Born This Way (The Country Road Version) //

It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby

My mama told me when I was young
"We are all born superstars"
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (Born this way)

Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't another way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be (Don't be, don't be)

Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M, hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vuole fe yah (Same DNA)

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't another way
Baby, I was born this way
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

If we wanna make it country, baby, it's okay
'Cause I was born, I was born, I was born this way
From London, Paris, Japan, back to USA
Yeah, I was born on the road, I was born to be brave

No matter gay, straight, or bi
Lesbian, transgender life
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to survive
No matter black, white, or beige
Chola or orient made
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to be brave!

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, yeah

Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't another way
Baby, I was born this way
I'm on the right track, baby

I'm gonna marry the night, I won't give up on my life

Down the streets that I love, in my fishnet gloves, I'm a sinner
Then I'll go down to the bar, but I won't cry anymore
I'll hold my whiskey up high, kiss the bartender twice, I'm a loser
I'm gonna marry the night, I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night, I'm gonna marry the night
I'm gonna marry the night, I'm gonna marry the night

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
Born this way

(Don't hide yourself-) [?]
I was born-
Don't hide yourself-
Just love yourself-
I'm on the right-
Baby, I- (Born this way)

Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be!

It doesn't matter if you love him
Or capital H-I-M
I born this way

Give yourself prudence
And love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M
I love my life I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (same DNA)

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
