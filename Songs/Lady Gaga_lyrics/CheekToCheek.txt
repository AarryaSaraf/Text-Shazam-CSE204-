// Anything Goes //

[Lady Gaga:]
In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows
Anything goes

[Tony Bennett:]
Good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four-letter words writing prose
Anything goes

[Tony Bennett:]
The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today

[Lady Gaga:]
And day's night today
And black's white today

[Tony Bennett:]
And most guys today
That women prize today

[Lady Gaga:]
Are just silly gigolos

[Lady Gaga:]
And though I'm not a great romancer
I know you're bound to answer

[Both:]
When we propose
Anything goes

[Tony Bennett:]
Go!

[Lady Gaga:]
Go!

The world has gone mad today

[Tony Bennett:]
And good's bad today

[Lady Gaga:]
And day's night today

[Tony Bennett:]
And black's white today

[Lady Gaga:]
And most guys today
That women prize today
Are just silly gigolos

[Both:]
And though we're not such great romancers
We know that you're bound to answer
When we propose
Anything goes

[Tony Bennett:]
Anything goes

[Lady Gaga:]
Anything goes

[Both:]
Anything goes

// Cheek To Cheek //

[Lady Gaga:]
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

[Tony Bennett:]
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

[Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga:]
Oh, I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak (me too)
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

[Tony Bennett:]
And I love to go out fishing
In a river, or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

[Both:]
Dance with me
I want my arm about you
The charm about you
Will carry me through

To heaven (heaven)
Yes I'm in heaven (I'm in heaven)
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

[Tony Bennett:]
Go

[Both:]
Dance with me
I want my arm about you
That charm about you
Will carry me through

[Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga:]
To heaven
I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
Oh baby when we're out together dancing
Out together dancing
Out together dancing cheek to cheek

// Don't Wait Too Long //

You are the summer and I am the autumn
Don't wait too long
Your song's beginning while mine has been sung
Don't wait too long

Fall is a lovely time of the year
When the leaves turn to gold and brown
But soon fall is ending and winter is near
And the leaves start tumblin' down

Why must the moments go by in such haste?
Don't wait too long
Winter is coming, we've no time to waste
Don't wait too long

And while my heart's gay and foolish and free and still can sing its song
Share every precious moment with me, don't wait too long

So while my heart's gay and foolish and free and still can sing its song
Share every precious moment with me, don't wait too long

// I Can't Give You Anything But Love //

[Lady Gaga:]
I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby

Dream a while, scheme a while you're sure to find
Happiness and I guess all those things you've always pined for

Gee, I like to see you looking swell, Tony
With diamond watches, Tiffany's just don't sell, baby
'Til the lucky day you know darn well
Oh I can't give you anything but love

[Tony Bennett:]
I can't give you anything but love, lady
That's the only thing I've plenty of, lady

Dream a while, scheme a while, you're sure to find
Happiness and I guess all those things you've always pined for

How you like to see me looking swell, lady?
Diamond bracelets, Woolworth doesn't sell, Gaga

[Both:]
'Til the lucky day you know darn well, baby
Oh I can't give you anything
I don't want just anything
Oh I can't give you anything but love, but love

// Nature Boy //

[Lady Gaga:]
There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far

Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

[Tony Bennett:]
And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me

[Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett:]
The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return

And then one day
One magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me

The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return

// Goody Goody //

So you met someone who set you back on your heels
(He's a sucker)
Goody goody!
So you met someone and now you know how it feels
(Let me just say that)
Goody goody!

So you gave him your heart too
Just as I gave mine to you
(Stop talking about this stuff)
And he broke it in little pieces
Now how do you do?
(It's not funny Tony)

So you lie awake singing the blues all night
Goody goody!
So you think that love's a barrel of dynamite
(I told you I'm not goody, I'm a baddie)

Hurray and hallelujah!
You had it coming to ya
(Think you're funny, huh?)

Goody goody for him
Goody goody for me
(Goody goody for you)
And I hope you're satisfied you rascal you
(That's real cheeky, Tony)

So you met someone who set you back on your heels
(So what?)
Goody goody!
So you met someone and now you know how it feels
(I was confused, you know?)
Goody goody!

So you gave him your heart too
Just as I gave mine to you
And he broke it in little pieces
(I know)
Now how do you do?

So you lie awake just singing the blues all night
(Yeah, all night, a-ha)
Goody goody!
So you think that love's a barrel of dynamite
(Yeah. So what? Sometimes)

Hurray and hallelujah!
You had it coming to ya
(Stop laying that)

Goody goody for him
Goody goody goody for me!
(I'm not a goody, I'm a baddie)

Your love has been denied
You've been taken for a ride
(What? Are you happy now?)
And I hope you're satisfied you rascal you!
(Yeah, I'll be fine. Just stop singing that song)

// Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye //

We love each other so deeply
That I ask you this, sweetheart
Why should we quarrel ever
Why can't we be enough clever
Never to part

Every time we say goodbye
I die a little
Every time we say goodbye
I wonder why a little

Why the gods above me
Who must be in the know
Think so little of me
They allow you to go

When you're near
There's such an air
Of spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere
Begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer
But how strange the change
From major to minor
Every time we say goodbye
Every time we say goodbye

// Firefly //

I call her Firefly
'Cause, oh, my
She radiates moon glow
Wants none of that noon glow
She starts to glitter
When the sun goes down

'Bout eight P.M., it's mayhem
She switches the brights up
Lights up and gives me a call
"Take me to the Fireflies ball"

But when I get her there
Set her there
Do I get to pet her there
Grab me some glow

No, she's a gad about, mad about
Luring every lad about
While leaving me moaning low

Oh, Firefly, why can't I
Latch onto you no how
Oh, how I love you but gee
While you set the night on
Firefly, shine a little light on me

He calls me Firefly
'Cause, oh, my
I radiate moon glow
Want none of that noon glow
Start to glitter
When the sun goes down

'Bout eight P.M., it's mayhem
I'm switching those brights up
Light up and give him a call
"Take me to the Fireflies ball"

When I get her there
I set her there
Do I get to pet her there
Grab me some glow

Well, she's a gad about, mad about
Luring every lad about
While leaving me moaning low

Oh, Firefly, why can't I
Latch on for you no how
Oh, how I love you but gee
While you set the night on
Firefly, shine a little light on
Shine a little light on
Shine a little light on me
(In the mornin')

// I Won't Dance //

[Tony Bennett:]
I won't dance
Don't ask me
I won't dance
Don't ask me
I won't dance
Madame with you

My heart won't let my feet
Do things they should do

You know what?
You're lovely

[Lady Gaga:]
And so what?
I'm lovely
But oh what'd you do to me?

I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor

[Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga:]
When you dance
You're charming and you're gentle
Especially when we do the continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental
For heaven rest us
We're not asbestos

And that's why I won't dance
Why should I?
I won't dance
How could I?
I won't dance
Merci beaucoup

You know that music leads the way to romance
So if I hold you in my arms
I won't dance

When you dance you're charming and you're gentle
Especially when we do the continental
But this feeling isn't purely mental (oh really?)
For heaven rest us
I'm not asbestos

And that's why I won't dance
Why should I?
I won't dance
How could I?
I won't dance
Merci beaucoup

We know that music leads the way to romance
So if I hold you in my arms
I won't dance
I won't dance
I won't dance
I won't dance
I won't dance, dance, dance!
I will dance!
Dance!

// They All Laughed //

They all laughed at Christopher Columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said man could fly
They told Marconi
Wireless was a phony
It's the same old cry
They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But, oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune

They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how!
Ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh now?

They all laughed at Rockefeller Center
Now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar

Ford and his Lizzie
Kept the laughers busy
That's how people are

They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, "Hello. Goodbye."
But, oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie

They all said we'd never get together
Darling, take a bow
Ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh?
Hee, hee, hee!
Let's have the past laugh
Ha, ha, ha!
Who's got the last laugh now?

// Lush Life //

I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails
The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distinguÃ© traces
That used to be there you could see where
They'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clocktails

Then you came along with your siren's song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for a while that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah, yes, I was wrong
Again I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough full of hearts
Could only be a bore

A week in Paris will ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it
I'll forget you I will
And yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush
Life in some small dive
And there I'll be
While I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too

// Sophisticated Lady //

They say into
Your early life
Romance came
And in this heart
Of yours
Burned a flame
A flame
That flickered
One day
And died away

Then
With disillusion
Deep in your eyes
You learned
That fools in love
Soon grow wise
The years
Have changed you
Somehow
I see you now

Smoking, drinking
Never thinking
Of tomorrow
Nonchalant
Diamonds shining
Dancing, dining
With some man
In a restaurant
Is that all
You really want?

No
Sophisticated lady
I know
You miss the love
You lost long ago
And when nobody
Is nigh you cry

Is that all
You really want?

No
Sophisticated lady
I know
You miss the heart
You lost long ago
And when nobody
Is nigh you cry

// Let's Face The Music And Dance //

There may be trouble ahead
But while there's moonlight and music and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance

Before the fiddlers have fled
Before they ask us to pay the bill
And while we still have the chance
Let's face the music and dance

Soon, we'll be without the moon
Humming a different tune
And then

There may be teardrops to shed
So while there's moonlight and music and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance

Take it! Come on!

Soon, we'll be without the moon
Humming a different tune
And then
And then

There may be teardrops to shed
So while there's moonlight and music and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance
Dance
Let's face the music and dance

// But Beautiful //

Love is funny, or it's sad
Or it's quiet, or it's mad
It's a good thing or it's bad
But beautiful
Beautiful to take a chance and if you fall you fall
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all

Love is tearful, or it's gay
It's a problem or it's play
It's a heartache either way
But beautiful
And I'm thinking if you were mine I'd never let you go
And that would be but beautiful I know

And I'm thinking if you were mine I'd never let you go
That would be but beautiful
That would be but beautiful
That would be but beautiful I know

// It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing) //

It don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
(Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah)

No, it don't mean a thing, all you gotta do is swing
(Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah)

Makes no difference if it's sweet or it's hot
Give it all the rhythm that you've got
Oh, it don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
(Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, Tony, Gaga)

It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm everything you've got

Oh, it don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
(Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah)

(Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah)

(Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah)

// Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down) //

I was five and he was six
We rode on the horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play

Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, you hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
I used to shoot you down

Music played and people sang
Not for me, no church bells rang

Now he's gone I don't know why
Until this day, sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, he hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
My baby shot me down

// On A Clear Day (You Can See Forever) //

On a clear day,
Rise and look around you,
And you'll see who you are.

On a clear day,
How it will astound you
That the glow of your being outshines every star.

You'll feel part of every mountain,
Sea and shore,
You can hear from far and near
A world you've never heard before.

And on a clear day,
On that clear day,
You can see forever,
And ever more.

// Bewitched, Bothered And Bewildered //

After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy I'm awake
With no Bromo Seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half pint imitation
Put me on the blink

But I'm wild again, beguiled again
Simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I could not sleep and wouldn't sleep
Till love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Oh I lost my heart, but what of it?
He is cold I agree
They can laugh, but I love him
And so the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, bring spring to him
And long for the day when I cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Oh!
I've sinned a lot, I mean a lot
But now I'm sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I
Bewitched! Bothered! And bewildered, am I

// The Lady's In Love With You //

If thereâs a gleam in her eye
Each time she straightens your tie
That means the ladyâs in love with you
And if she canât dress for a date
Without that waiting you hate
That means the ladyâs in love with you
And when your friends ask you over to join the table
But she will find that far away booth for two
Well Jack, hereâs just how it stands
Youâve got romance on your hands
Because the ladyâs in love with you

// The Lady Is A Tramp //

[Tony Bennett:]
She gets too hungry for dinner at 8

[Lady Gaga:]
(I'm starving)

[Tony Bennett:]
She loves the theater but she never comes late

[Lady Gaga:]
I never bother with people that I hate
That's why this chick is a tramp

[Tony Bennett:]
She doesn't like crap games with barons and earls

[Lady Gaga:]
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
And I definitely won't dish our dirt with the rest of those girls

[Tony Bennett:]
(Thank you)
That's why the lady is a tramp

[Lady Gaga:]
I love the free fresh wind in my hair

[Tony Bennett:]
Life without care

[Lady Gaga:]
Oh, I'm so broke

[Tony Bennett:]
It's oke

[Lady Gaga:]
I hate California. It's crowded and damp

[Tony Bennett:]
That's why the lady is a tramp

[Lady Gaga:]
I'm a tramp!

Sometimes I go to Coney Island

[Tony Bennett:]
Oh, the beach is divine

[Lady Gaga:]
I love the Yankees

[Tony Bennett:]
Jeter is just fine

[Lady Gaga:]
I follow Rogers and Hart

[Tony Bennett:]
She sings every line

[BOTH:]
That's why the lady is a tramp

[Lady Gaga:]
I love the prize fight

[Tony Bennett:]
That isn't a fake

[Lady Gaga:]
No fakes

And I love to rowboat with you and your wife in Central Park Lake

[Tony Bennett:]
She goes to the opera and stays wide awake

[Lady Gaga:]
Yes I do

That's why this lady is a tramp

[Tony Bennett:]
She likes the green (green) grass (grass) under her shoes

[Lady Gaga:]
What can I lose? 'Cause I got no dough (Oh no?)
I'm all alone when I lower my lamp

[Tony Bennett:]
That's why the lady is a tramp
Go

[Lady Gaga:]
I love your free, fresh, I love your handkerchief in my hair

[Tony Bennett:]
Life without care

[Lady Gaga:]
(Polka-dot)
But I'm so broke!

[Tony Bennett:]
That's oke!

Hates California, it's cold and it's damp

[Both:]
That's why the lady is a tramp
That's why this lady is a tramp!

[Lady Gaga:]
That's why the lady is a tramp
