// You And I //

It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time, but I'm back in town
This time I'm not leaving without you
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I'm not leaving without you

He said, "Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,"

(Something), something about this place
(Something), something about New York Nights
And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool American guy
Yeah, there's something about, baby, you and I

America, America, I love you!
You and I

You, you, you and I
You, you and I
You, you and I
You, you and I, I
You and I
You, you, you and I
America, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I

We got a whole lot of money, but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in Heaven
There's only three men that I'ma serve my whole life
It's my daddy, and America, and Jesus Christ
(Happy Thanksgiving)

(Something), something about the chase
Six whole years
So put your drinks up, put your drinks up
For America, America, I love you

You, you and I
Oh yeah, well, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I

// The Edge Of Glory //

There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
But I got a reason that you-hoo should take me home tonight
I need a man that thinks it right when it's so wrong
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
Right on the limit's where we know we both belong, tonight

It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you

Another shot, before we kiss the other side
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
I'm on the edge of something final we call life, tonight
(Alright! Alright!)
Put on your shades, 'cause I'll be dancing in the flames
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
It isn't hell if everybody knows my name, tonight
(Alright! Alright!)

It's hot to feel the rush
To brush the dangerous
I'm gonna run right to, to the edge with you
Where we can both fall far in love

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you
I'm on the edge with you
I'm on the edge with you

I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment of truth
Out on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge
I'm on the edge of glory
And I'm hangin' on a moment with you
I'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
I'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
I'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you, with you
I'm on the edge with you, with you, with you, with you, with you

// White Christmas //

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the one I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen to hear sleigh bells in the snow
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm dreaming of a white, white, white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
Oh, may your days be so very merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

So, as you can tell I'm very outgoing
And a little bit shy, but I decided that this song is just too short
It's such a beautiful Christmas song, but it's only one verse, so I added one extra one
Here it goes...

I'm dreaming of a white Snowman
With the carrot nose and charcoal eyes
And oh, when he cries, I'm going to tell him it's okay
Because Santa's on his sleigh, and on his way
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
So may your days and Thanksgiving be so bright
And may all your Christmases be white

// Orange Colored Sky //

So...let's do Orange Colored Sky
Yeah?
I used to sing this at the Oak Room with my buddies
Woo! It's getting windy

I was walking along, minding my business
When out of the orange colored sky
Flash, bam, alakazam
Wonderful you came by
I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine
When out of that orange colored view
Wham, bam, alakazam
I got a look at you

Oh, one look and I yelled, "Timber!"
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit
This is it, this is it

I was walking along, minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Wham, bam, alakazam
Out of the orange colored sky

Oh-oh-oh-oh, one look and I yelled, "Timber!"
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit
This is it, this is it

I was walking along, minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Wham, bam, alakazam
Out of the orange colored, purple striped, pretty green polka-dot sky
Wham, bam, alakazam
And gone, bye
Goodbye
