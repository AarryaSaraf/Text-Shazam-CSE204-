Album: EqualRights

// I Am That I Am //

I'm not in this world
To live up to your expectations
Neither are you here to live up to mine

I don't owe no one
No obligation
No one owe me none
So everything is fine, fine

[Chorus:]
I said 
I am that I am I am I am I am [4x]

Don't underestimate
My ability
Don't definite my character
Don't belittle
My authority
It is time you recognized my quality

[Chorus]

Learn to love
To love your brother
Don't covet your neighbour

Flee from the city
It's getting shitty
It is full of out-a-quity

[Chorus]

I am the rock of the ages
You cannot move I at all
I am the son of lightning
You cannot move I at all
Son of Jacob
Cannot move me at all
I am the son of Moses
You can't move I at all
I am the son of David
You cannot move I at all

I am a firm ripe diamond
You cannot move I at all
You could a shed more tears
You cannot move I at all

You could a full of evil
You cannot move I at all
You could a try more nuttin'
You cannot move I at all

And you can try make a something
That can't move I at all
And could a come with ism
You can't move I at all

And could come with skism
That can't move I at all

// Jah Guide //

Here though I trod through this valley
I will fear no evil
[2x]
'Cause I know
Jah Guide [3x]
Jah Guide [2x] I through this valley
And I know he will
When I'm trodding through this valley
I know he will

[Chorus:]
Though my enemies fight me everyday
I will fear no evil
Though my enemies set traps in my way
Still I will fear no evil

[Chorus]

Many petty workers dig pits every day
But I don't fear no evil
Out-a-quity workers fight me everyday
Still I will fear no evil

[Chorus]

Pestilence lurks in dark places
And I fear no evil
Destruction walk with smiling faces
Still I will fear no evil

[Chorus]

When I'm walking the streets
I know he will (Precedes each line below)
When I'm smoking my pipe
When I'm troddin' the earth
When I'm driving the road
When they dig pits in my way
When they try to keep me down

// Apartheid //

You in a me land
Quite illegal
You're in a me land
Dig out me gold
In a me land
Digging out me pearls
In a me land
Dig out me diamonds

We a go fight [3x] against apartheid
We got to fight [3x] against apartheid

You're in a me land
And you build up your 'partment
You're in a me land
You build up you're regimes
You're in a me land
Only talk 'bout justice
You're in a me land
Handing down injustice

[Chorus]

You're in a me land (Precedes each line below)
You no build no school for black children
No hospital for black people
You build your prison
You build their camp

[Chorus]

Africa's for black man
Remember
There certain place in Africa
Black man get no recognition

[Chorus]

You cross the border
You shoot off the children
Cross the border
Shoot down women
Cross the border
You take your might
Cross the border
To beat for right

[Chorus]

As for majority
Majority rule, yea
Who need minority
But that couldn't rule, yea

[Chorus]

You break off
Break off from Britain
You're quite illegal
Right where you are
You get your forces
From colonial powers
Taking my diamonds
Filling ballistic missiles

[Chorus]
