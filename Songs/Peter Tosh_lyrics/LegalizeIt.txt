Let the dead bury the dead now
and who is to be fed, be fed

yet you want I

// Why Must I Cry //

Why must I cry
these tears from mine eyes
[x2]

Making believe you love me only
was my great sin whoa [x3]

But I will never fall in love again
'cause only my heart feels the pain

Why must I trod
this lonely lonely road
why must I carry
this heavy heavy load

Making believe you love me only
was my great sin [x3]
mmm my great sin

I'll never fall in love again
'cause only my heart feels the pain
feels the pain
sad pain

I will never fall in love again
'cause only my heart feels the pain
feels the pain
why must I cry these tears from mine eyes [x2]

// Igziabeher (Let Jah Be Praised) //

Igziabeher
let Jah be praised
negusa neghast
let Jah be praised
me don e-ah lamb

Let Jah be praised
let him be praised [x3]

He watereth the hills
from his chambers
and the earth is satisfied
so satisfied
he maketh the grass to grow for animals
Jah made the herb for man [x3]

Fret not thyself
because of evildoers
neither be thou envious
against the workers of inequity
for they shall soon be cut down
cut down like grass
and they shall wither like corn

Let Jah arise
and let all his enemies be scattered
let them that hate Jah
now scat up shut up butt up and flat up
as the smoke was driven away
Jah, drive them away
as the rocks melted
let them be melted Jah-Jah

Igziabeher
let Jah be praised
you don e-ah lamb
let Jah be praised
negusa neghast
let Jah be praised
let him be praised [x4]

Ahh... lightning

igziabeher

Weakheart scat up shut up flat up and butt out
I feel it
weakheart feel it
kill them dead before them spread...
