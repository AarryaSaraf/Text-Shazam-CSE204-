Album: Immutable

// Broken Cog //

Inside
Watching the core
Of whatever we had left of our lives
The multiplications divide
We drink to quench the thirst to come
With the bones that we left the trap was sprung

Blind, ancient and malevolent
Cosmos divides
The truth is we never ever had truth in sight
We spat on this purpose
We ate of whatever was left
The chasm beneath us will open and swallow the rest

Me the broken cog
You seem to not have understood
Knife's out
Strings set in motion
You act like you're surprised
Pre-emptive strike
Ruin
Chaos
Focus

Whispers, murmurs, voices, voices
Whispers, purpose, voices, murmurs
Whispers, murmurs, voices, voices
Whispers, murmurs, voices, purpose

// The Abysmal Eye //

Relentless and inexorable
This menacing creation
That we ourselves conceived
With covetous verve and credulity
Something this intensely profound
Can never be allowed
The fabric and all that holds it
Will all burn
It will all be torn down

To contain it in its lair
Pandora's quantum prison
In wave after wave
It will see us fail

Consign to oblivion
This thing we cannot grasp
Bury deep this entity
Unlearn it ever existed

This is our omega
Factitious nemesis
The great dismantler
Of our dominion

If ever there was a reason
Maintain this greatest lie
That never did we look
Into the abysmal eye

// Light The Shortening Fuse //

Blinded, gagged and bound by confirmation
On this premise we iterate a lie
Why will stay unasked
They know, we know, it doesn't matter

Barren hollow words, no information
We're led to believe in self-applied deceit
This trope of ignorance, disinformation
Made to confuse, to light the shortened fuse

Wading through the rubble of ideologies
Cherrypicking madness to the gospel of suckers
Sustenance for the greatest of ideas
Life is a machine, it will cater to me
Bow, serve, comply

Bared teeth, the lesson is complete
The stench of strange raw meat
Draw acolytes to feast
Rotting thoughts the treat

So who came up with your ideas
Before you spat them out like they were yours
Play the pawn, knowing where hope lies
Where it goes to die

// Phantoms //

From the realms of past my demons howl
Beyond bridges I lit they learned to fly
Apparitions, these ghosts of distant memory
Spectres. Remnants that just will not die

All my wrongs, my indiscretions they carry
From across the boundaries of time
The burdens I left for them to hold
Presented, laid out before my eyes

In their frozen gaze the blame
The questions to my lies
How hard I have tried to bury this
Yet here they stand before me â Phantoms

// Ligature Marks //

So here we are
Tearing at flesh to scar
Carving the mark in servitude of the dark
Realign the weaponry of your mind
A surgical strike
Nothing left to find

The ghost of sacrifices made
Lingering in the shadows
Perversion is the trade
So this will hurt in every way
But you will crave me
Beg me to stay

And it flows through every fiber, runs through every vein
Twisted energy. Tracing insanity through ligature marks
Bruises formed in the dark

Facing the music, you've never heard this song before
A solemn requiem, a shroud for your machinations and strife
Intent to euthanize

Empty sheet nothing left to deplete
The loop becomes complete
The void will swallow the melting stars
Suspended in emptiness
Torment turns to bliss
A stillborn genesis

// God He Sees In Mirrors //

On the throne sits the snake
Coiled and irate. Self righteous. Unforgiving
Lies lining the fork of his tongue, drip from his fangs
Inflicting wounds that never mend

Omnipotent God he sees in mirrors. Seraphic

From atop the growing tower of our bones
Indifferently condemning all
At his whim our dismal fate
From his mouth but venomous gall

Ophidian. Slithering. Deceitful serpentine

Illustrious morph of man
Despot in guise of savior
Any blame he will carelessly relinquish
Like shedding his skin

Ophidian. Slithering. Deceitful
Through the vast of death he caused he winds
Serpentine

Never again shall we suffer the hissing
The subversive, malicious lies lining the fork of his tongue
Drip from his fangs
Inflicting wounds that never mend

Omnipotent God he sees in mirrors

// Kaleidoscope //

This untethering from logic
This beautiful, terrifying state
Astonishing. Uninhibited
Maddening. Euphoric

I now see through you. Translucent entities
Gone is the veil of sanity
The colors I now discern
Veracity as a boundless spectrum

A vast kaleidoscope
Spiraling enlightenment
Magnificent altered condition
Confined no more my vision

Inert and bursting
Here impossibles co-exist
In this vibrant domain
Truth is anything you dream it is

Here I can sense true fulfillment
Shedding the old, finding a new I
Devoid of restraints
Exempt from your lies

// I Am That Thirst //

Look at him yearning
Desirous
His craving, his hunger
Constant needs, constant wants
Nothing will quell
Nothing will slake
Insatiable vacuous man

Hollow and see-through
His emptiness has made him frail
That dying thing still believes
Others drive the nails
Incendiary god complex
Such gift to flammable man
This is what it made of him
This is what remains

Behold, how he devours
Unappeasable and cursed
That arid soul, famished and desiccated
I am that thirst

His gluttony can not be stilled
This state can never be reversed
Hollow and empty
Endlessly

// The Faultless //

A slow violence of words
This injurious game you play
Spiteful syllable strings
Arranged and tied into weapons
Weapons

The incisions of your tongue, the slashing
The deliberate cuts run deep and wide
Whatever carved the pedestal you occupy
Was set on this resulting divide

I see through your vain pretence
The veil of you has been parted
Pure and fair you fly on wings up high
Pharisaical. You are faultless

Of all the wounds I expected
Heartbreak, bereavement and despair
I never saw these coming
The gashes of your betrayal

// Armies Of The Preposterous //

The awe it instills
How grand this revolting spectacle
Beyond what we can fathom
So far detached from reason
I quiver before it, I tremble
I see your vision, this bleak truth you contrive

Magnificent this vile display
The march of a recurring echo
Jericho trumpets blaring - again they sound
And the old armies of the misled rebuild, reassemble

I will not swallow the bile
The putrid ideals you regurgitate

A conviction saturated with imbecility
Adopting the course of the blind
Unanimous in your revolting declaration
Conjured by offensive, feeble beehive minds

A pandemic, this contagion you embrace
The poison that seeps from your piteous souls
Armies of the preposterous, trapped in misguided thrall
Your mere existence shames us all

I will never assimilate your point of view
I see your vision, this bleak truth you contrive
