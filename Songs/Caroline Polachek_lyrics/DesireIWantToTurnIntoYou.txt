Album: DesireIWantToTurnIntoYou

// Welcome To My Island //

Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'
Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'

Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna turn into you
Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna turn into you
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
The ocean blue
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
The ocean blue

Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'

Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna turn into you
Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna turn into you
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
The ocean blue
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
The ocean blue

I am my father's daughter in the end
He says, "Watch your ego, watch your head, girl
You're so smart, so talented
But now the water's turning red
And it's all your fault and it's all your mess
And you're all alone, you can't go to bed
Too high on your adrenaline
You gotta go somewhere where you can't pretend, oh
Forget the rules, forget your friends
Just you and your reflection
'Cause nothing's gonna be the same again
No, nothing's gonna be the same again"

Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
The ocean blue
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
The ocean blue

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

// Pretty In Possible //

Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da (Mmm)
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da (Mmm)

Time's running out, innit?
Pity the mayflies in the swimming pool at dawn
But down in the deep
I can't be left alone
Sweet Eliza's on the court
Potential is the drug
They never knew, you never tried
But you see it in my eyes, and that is bae
Threading the needle, pretty in possible
If only to get me out the door
Oracle and odyssey
With a bloody nose
If I'm on your street, you'll be the last to know
That I get dizzy (Yeah), dizzy (Yeah) and I cannot afford that kind of free

Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da (Mmm)
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da (Well, how does it feel)
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da (Being so, you know)
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da (Rich?), da-da (Mmm)

Now you got one eye on the lane and one eye on the lava
Spinning out, yeah, I respect that
But I was born to get you home
Home, where it's all red and velveteen
Falling back into the leaves
So true
With your lipstick on my thigh
Drink the tears until they dry-y-y
I-I, I-I, I-I (Eye eye eye eye eye)

Mm-mm-mm, oh
Pretty in possible
Mm-mm-mm, oh
Pretty in possible
Mm-mm-mm, oh
Pretty in possible (Fragile)
Mm-mm-mm, oh
Pretty in possible

Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da (Mmm)
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da (Mmm)
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da (Mmm)
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da (Mmm)

// Bunny Is a Rider //

Bunny is a rider
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing for free
Bunny is a rider
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing for free
Bunny is a rider
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing
Bunny is a-Bunny is a, a rider
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy, hmm

But I'm so non-physical
I do, I do, feel like the lady
I do, I do, fireworks blazing
I do, I do, heart is unbreaking
I do, I do, but don't drop my name

Bunny is a rider (Bunny is a r...)
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing for free
Bunny is a rider
Giddy up, can't find her
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing for free

Dirty like it's earth day
Tryna wet that palette
Can you cut that check
Crush that wreck
Run out empty on 'em
AWOL on a Thursday
Tryna go ask Alice
Tryna catch that rabbit

But I'm so non-physical
I do, I do, feel like the lady
I do, I do, fireworks blazing
I do, I do, heart is unbreaking
I do, I do, but don't drop my name

Bunny is a-Bunny is a, a rider
Can't find her, eeh
(Ain't nothing)
Bunny is a-Bunny is a, a rider
Can't find her, eeh

Yeah, I'm so non-physical
I do, I do, feel like the lady
I do, I do, fireworks blazing
I do, I do, heart is unbreaking
I do, I do, but don't drop my name

Bunny is a-Bunny is a, a rider
Can't find her, eeh
(Ain't nothing)
Bunny is a-Bunny is a, a rider
Can't find her, eeh
(Ain't nothing)
Bunny is a-Bunny is a, a rider
Can't find her, eeh
(Ain't nothing)
Bunny is a-Bunny is a
Bunny is a rider

// Sunset //

These days
I wear my body like an uninvited guest
I turn it right and right and right
Instead of turning left
But boy, your patience is a magic kind of medicine
'Cause every spiral brings me
Back into your arms again

So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset
Fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms
A warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away
Let's ride away

So many stories we were told about a safety net
But when I look for it, it's just a hand that's holding mine
I'm wearing black to mourn the sudden loss of innocence
And that's alright because it hides the dirt and hides the wine

So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset
Fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms
A warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away
Let's ride away

So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset
Fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms
A warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away (Let's ride away)

// Crude Drawing Of An Angel //

Draw the blinds
Draw the bath
It's a matter of time
Til you wake up and watch me
Draw your brow
With shaky hand
So that after you're gone
I got something to hold onto

Red light
Oh my faults
Camera one, camera two
Oh my greed
On your side, on the carpet
Oh your need
Camera one, camera two

Angel
I'd hold you down
Forsake me
Here on the ground
All or nothing

Draw your blood
Draw your breath
Skip the whites of your eyes
Til you wake up and watch me
Draw your wings
From your back
I'll not be shy
No, I'll not be gentle with you

Red light
Oh my faults
Camera one, camera two
Oh my greed
On your side, on the carpet
Oh your need
Camera one, camera two

Angel
I'd hold you down
Forsake me
Here on the ground
All or nothing

All or nothing

// I Believe //

(Look over the edge, but not too far)

You're not alone
Under a sky of vultures
With all that could've been
You made it home
With silver string unbroken
Ain't that the sweetest gift

Oh, little miracle
Swing low
Where there can be no compromises
Down low

I don't know but I believe
We'll get another day together
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh
No, I don't know but I believe

And I'd have said it was impossible
To find you in this life and keep you just enough

Oh, little miracle
Swing low
Where there can be no compromises
Down low

I don't know but I believe (Oh)
We'll get another day together (Oh)
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh (Oh)
No, I don't know but I believe

(Look over the edge, but not too far)
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh (Look over the edge, but not too far)
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh

I don't know but I believe
We'll get another day together
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh
No, I don't know but I believe (Ah)

Violent love, feel my embrace
(Look over the edge, but not too far)
(But not too far)

// Fly To You //

How I remember, how I forget
Wanted to hate you but love you instead
Violence made me gentle at last
Closer and closer and closer to you
Baby, I'm dying to find you

Ooh, I fly to you (Hey)
After all the tears (Hey)
You're all I need (Hey)
I fly to you (Woo)
Not just somewhere
Deep inside of me (Hey)

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (Hey)
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (Hey)
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (Woo)
Ah-ah

Driving through the dark
Lost but I'm free
I'm looking for something
That nobody else can see (See)
Will you still love me
After the bend? (The bend)
Remember what's gone before
Not loaded with regret (Regret)

Ooh, I fly to you (Hey)
After all the tears (Hey)
You're all I need (Hey)
I fly to you (Woo)
Not just somewhere
Deep inside of me (Hey)

(Hey)
(Hey)
(Woo)

Mmm, I fly to you
After all the tears
You're all I need
I fly to you
Not just somewhere
Deep inside of me (How I remember)
Ooh, I fly to you (How I forget)
After all the tears (Wanted to hate you, but love you instead)
You're all I need (violence made me)
I fly to you (Gentle at last)
Not just somewhere (Closer and closer and closer to you)
Deep inside of me (Baby, I'm dying to find out)

I'm looking for something
Nobody else can see
Remember what's gone before
Not loaded with regret

// Blood And Butter //

I look at you, in denim and bows
I know the mode, the mode is lethal
Say you wanna show me your place
The place is here, the here is inside you
Where did you come from, you?

I'm pretty with the critical mass
Your body has the body power
Layin' at the foot of a linden
In the navel ring, inventing June
Where did you come from, you?

And what I want is, to walk beside you
Needing nothing, but the sun that's in our eyes
Paint the picture in blood and butter
Holy water, fire in sky

Let me dive through your face
To the sweetest kind of pain
Call you up, nothin' to say
No, I don't need no one entertaining
When the world is a bed
Give me green and ribbon red
Oh, get closer than your new tattoo

Look at you all mythicalogical
And wikipediated
Look how I forget who I was
Before I was the way I am with you
Where did you come from, you?

And what I want is, to walk beside you
Needing nothing, but the sun that's in our eyes
Paint the picture in blood and butter
Holy water, fire in sky

Let me dive through your face
To the sweetest kind of pain
Call you up, nothin' to say
No, I don't need no one entertaining
When the world is a bed
Give me green and ribbon red
Oh, get closer than your new tattoo

Closer than yourâ

// Hopedrunk Everasking //

Starlight in the tunnel
Kind of familiar
Hope-drunk ever-asking
How does it feel to know?
Your final form?
So old, so new

Pull close to me
And never be alone
Ooh

Real life is a rumor
Under the theatre
Deeper, dig it deeper
Till the meanwhile slows
They'll find our bones
And yet, they won't

Pull close to me
And never be alone
Ooh (Ah)

(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Dawn is just a headspace
Night is a feeling
Hope-drunk ever-asking
Centuries come and go
They'll find our bones
And yet, they won't

// Butterfly Net //

Earth went silent
London fell asleep
She dreamed of winter
Where you appeared to me
Perfect timing as new petals in November
A tender creature
A fever
Disarming, fluorescent

There you were
With your mirror
Shining the world all over me
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light

I collected
Stupid ashes
So that after you'd gone
I could hold onto something
But you stayed unwavering
Through every false goodbye
Unsubsiding
Pining
For now and for never

There you were
With your mirror
Shining the world all over me
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light

Oh if only
The umbrella of the sky
Could wrap us up and up
That's where I'd zoom in close
Dilated as your eyes
But til then I'll keep it brief

Faithful inertia
Her bullet doesn't slow
It seeks and finds me
How far it goes
Heaven help me
Take this bag of wings
And drown it in the thames
And wake tomorrow
Hollow
Hardly forgetting

There you were...
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light

Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na

It's just smoke
Floating over the volcano
It's just smoke
Selling me out on the down low

And you are
The big answer tonight
And you are
Melting everything about me, oh
Don't worry about me
It's just smoke

(Mmm)
(Ah, mmm)

And the fallout doesn't phase me
Take a bullet for my baby
For the one thing that'll save me
I know (Hmm)
Throw it all out and replace it
With a brand new kind of crazy
Don't believe it when you praise me
Do I (Hmm)

And you are
The big answer tonight
And you are
Melting everything about me, oh
Don't worry about me
It's just (Ah)

Na-na-na, na-na-na

// Billions //

Psycho, priceless
Good in a crisis
Working the angles, oh, oh
Billions

Sexting, sonnets
Under the tables
Tangled in cables, oh, oh
Billions

Salting, flavour
Lies like a sailor
But he loves like a painter, oh, oh
Billions

Hand it over, broker
Give me the closure
Here's a pearl of the oyster, oh, oh
Billions

Say, say, say, say something to me
Say, say, say, say something to me

Headless, angel
Body upgraded
But it's dead on arrival, oh, oh
(Billions)

Twisted, manic
Cornucopia
Can my cup overflow with, oh, oh
(Billions)

I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you (I never felt so close to you)
(I never felt so close to you)

Psycho, priceless
Good in a crisis
Working the angles, oh, oh
Billions

Hand it over, broker
Give me the closure
Here's a pearl of the oyster, oh, oh
Billions

(Oh, oh) Say, say, say, say something to me
(Oh, oh) Say, say, say, say something to me

Oh, I've never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
