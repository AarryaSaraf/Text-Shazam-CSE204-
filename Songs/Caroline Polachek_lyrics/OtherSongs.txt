// Bang Bang //

I was five, and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down

Seasons came and changed the time
I grew up, called him mine
He would always laugh and say
"Remember when we used to play?"

Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, you hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down

Music played, and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Now he's gone, I don't know why
And till this day sometimes I cry
He didn't even say, "Goodbye"
He didn't take the time to lie

Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down
Bang bang (Bomb-bomb-bi-da)
Bang bang
Bang bang (Hey)

// Breathless //

Go on, go on
Go on, go on
Go on, go on
Go on

The daylight's fading slowly
My time with you is standing still
I'm waiting for you only
The slightest touch and I feel weak

I cannot lie
From you I can not hide
I'm losing will to try
Can't hide it
Can't fight it

So go on, go on
Come on, leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
Till I can't deny this

Loving feeling
Make me long for your kiss
Go on, go on
Yeah, come on

And if there's no tomorrow
And all we have is here and now
I'm happy just to have you
You're all the love I need somehow

It's like a dream
Although I'm not asleep
I never want to wake up
Don't lose it
Don't leave it

So go on, go on
Come on, leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
Till I can't deny this
Loving feeling
Make me long for your kiss
Go on, go on
Yeah, come on

Now I can't lie
From you I can not hide
I've lost my will to try
Can't hide it
Can't fight it

So go on, go on
Go on, go on
Go on, go on
Go on, go on
Go on, go on
Go on
Leave me breathless

So go on, go on
Come on, leave me breathless
Tempt me, tease me
Till I can't deny this
Loving feeling
Make me long for your kiss

Go on, go on
Yeah, come on

// Hit Me Where It Hurts (Toro Y Moi Remix) //

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
Go on and hit me in the

Bullseye, dead end
Moving target
Carousel, carousel
Baggage, claim it
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out, ride it out

Magic carpet
Over London
Through the ceiling
Watch you dreaming
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
Go on and hit me in the

Blind spot, Achilles' heel
Long shot, left field
Vertigo, vertigo
High stakes, popped ears
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out

Do you feel safe?
Now that you've found my cure?
I'll be the nurse
You'll be my number one

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time

// Last Days: Non Voglio Mai Vedere Il Sole Tramontare //

Oh, la mia vita!
Tutta la mia vita!
Ti ho cercato
Ho cercato il tuo tocco
Come un'alba
Come un vulcano
Abbi pietÃ  di me
Abbi pietÃ  di me
Non voglio mai vedere il tramonto

Oh, la mia vita!
Non ho mai amato cosÃ¬ tanto la vita
(Ho amato cosÃ¬ tanto la vita)
Non voglio che finisca mai

// Long Road Home //

We don't rely on "There's nowhere to go"
We realize that the soul grows
We just deny that the truth is untold
No one to rally us both

I don't know why they don't wanna transform
Taking the long road home

Doesn't the sky look like maps to our house?
Doesn't the sea look so empty?
Even my dreams kissed in digital gloss
It's my reality

I don't know why they don't wanna transform
Taking the long road home

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh

I don't know why they don't wanna transform
Taking the long way home
Alone

I don't
I don't know why they don't wanna
I don't know why they don't wanna
I don't know why they don't wanna
I don't know why they don't wanna transform

// Oh Yeah (Caroline Polachek Remix) //

Oh yeah, I don't need you
No, yeah, you don't need me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, look me in the eye
Yeah, I never cry

Oh yeah, say I knew you
Oh yeah, like you knew me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let me read your mind
For the final time

But I know what you're feeling (I feel it, too)
I know that you're falling (Falling away)
I know what you're thinking (Say the word)
I know that it's o, oh, oh oh oh

Oh yeah, never felt so
Oh yeah (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah), so alive
So let me tell you how to do it right
You only got one life

Oh yeah, you don't need it
No, yeah, just believe it
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we can make amends
Right before it ends

But I know what you're feeling (I feel it, too)
I know that you're falling (Falling away)
I know what you're thinking (Say the word)
I know that it's o, oh, oh oh oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah yeah yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah yeah yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah yeah yeah

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah yeah yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah yeah yeah

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

// So Cold You're Hurting My Feelings //

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Not like I'm counting the days (Ah, ah, ah)
But it's been twenty-five (Ah, ah, ah)
You're out there riding the sleigh (Ah, ah, ah) (Ho-ho-ho)
But damn, I miss you tonight (Ah, ah, mmm)

And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me presents, you're making it worse
'Cause you're so cold it's hurting my feelings

I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me
You're the only one who knows me, babe
So cold you're hurting my feelings (Woo)
Can't deal

With all the mistletoe dreamin' (Ah, ah, ah)
Back on the coast-to-coast life (Ah, ah, ah)
You know I live for the Tinsel (Ah, ah, ah)
But damn, I miss you tonight (Ah, ah, mmm)

And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me presents, you're making it worse
'Cause you're so cold it's hurting my feelings

I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me
You're the only one who knows me, babe
So cold you're hurting my feelings (Woo)
Can't deal

I'm a good girl santa (Na-na-na-na-na)
I'm a good girl santa (Na-na-na)
I'm a good girl santa (Na-na-na-na-na)
I'm a good girl santa (Na-na-na-na)

And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me presents, you're making it worse
'Cause you're so cold it's hurting my feelings (Ho-ho-ho)

I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me
You're the only one who knows me, babe (Only one who knows me, babe)
So cold you're hurting my feelings (Woo)
Can't deal
So cold you're hurting my feelings (Woo)
Can't deal (Woo)
So cold you're hurting my feelings (Woo)
Can't deal (Woo)
So cold you're hurting my feelings (Woo)
Can't deal

// Welcome To My Island (George Daniel & Charli XCX Remix) //

I like to live my life luxurious
Eating caviar toast, buying out the Ritz
I've been told I can be tricky in relationships
'Cause I need someone who can take on all the challenges
I won't lie, yeah, I've always been afraid to commit
But now I've fallen so hard, it's a total eclipse
'Cause it's emotional and physical and so legit
He's got my legs wide out like banana split
We're always showering each other in expensive gifts
I put the two-tone Cartier on his wrist
It was love at first sight from the moment we kissed
I want a white dress, country side house, and kids
Back at the start, think you knew that I was dangerous
With my face enhanced and my natural lips
I told him, "Catch a flight, see if you can handle it
And if you can then, welcome to my island, bitch"

Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island
I wanna turn into you

I guess I'm on my Richard Branson wave
No virgin, but I knew just how to behave
'Cause I can be a good girl, buxom milkmaid
Or you can drive me down to Florida and fuck me for days
Back at the start, think you knew that I was dangerous
I've done a couple bad things if you catch my drift
I told him, "Baby, you can pull up on the landing strip
And if you do it right, welcome to my island, bitch"

Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island
I wanna turn into you
Welcome to my island, bitch
Desire
I wanna turn into you
Welcome to my island, bitch
Desire
I wanna turn into you

Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'
Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
I wanna turn into you

I wanna turn into you
I wanna turn into you
