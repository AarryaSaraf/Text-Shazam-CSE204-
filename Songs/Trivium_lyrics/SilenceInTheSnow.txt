Album: SilenceInTheSnow

// Silence In The Snow //

Here we all stand on this canvas of white
Our palette holds but only one shade tonight
Silence snows in, in her wintery chill
Letâs paint the ground red with the blood of our kill

Kill
The battle goes

Silence in the snow
We must fight till they all die
In their cold blood
Silence in the snow

Hell hath no hold on a warriorâs mind
See how the snow has made each of us blind
Vibrant colors spray from new dead
Staining the earth such a beautiful red

Red
The battle goes
On and on
Make your stand

Silence in the snow
We must fight till they all die
In their cold blood
Silence in the snow

Iâm left in the cold
As winter unfolds
The blood on my hands is my own

Silence in the snow
We must fight till they all die
In their cold blood
Silence in the snow

Silence in the snow
Silence in the snow

// Blind Leading The Blind //

Losing
Losing my faith in
The world that surrounds me
Am I
Am I the only one
To constantly question it all

So
So far away
Itâs ourselves that we betray
How has it come to this
We are but drones
Silenced, led amiss

Bearer of light
Break down the walls
Remove the chains
Run towards the night

Blind leading the blind to the sea
Theyâre drowning
Blind leading the blind to the edge
Theyâre falling down
You hear them calling
But itâs too late for them
Now claim freedom
Save yourself

Calling
Calling for action
I demand that you question
Are you
Are you content with the truth
That they have fed down to you

Think
Think for yourselves
You must break out from this hell
How has it come to this
We are but drones
Silenced, led amiss

Bearer of light
Break down the walls
Remove the chains
Run towards the night

Blind leading the blind to the sea
Theyâre drowning
Blind leading the blind to the edge
Theyâre falling down
You hear them calling
But itâs too late for them
Now claim freedom
Save yourself

We must break
We must break free from this hell
We must break
We must break free from this hell

Bearer of light
Break down the walls
Remove the chains
Run towards the night

Your blind leading the blind to the sea
Theyâre drowning
Blind leading the blind to the edge
Theyâre falling down
You hear them calling
But itâs too late for them
Now claim freedom
Save yourself

Just save yourself
Save yourself

// Dead And Gone //

I fear I'll die a forgotten man
Just a number, a grain of sand

Time won't heal, it's running out on me
All your pain, it's more than I can take

War still rages
Will you keep fighting when I'm gone
Through the ages
Will you keep fighting when I am dead and gone
Dead and gone

I hope to die with no regrets
To leave a mark no one forgets

Time won't heal, it's running out on me
All your pain, it's more than I can take

War still rages
Will you keep fighting when I'm gone
Through the ages
Will you keep fighting, when I am dead and gone
Dead and gone

Bearing down, bearing down on me
The weight of all my insecurities

Closing in, closing in on me
The walls collapse, I'll never be set free

War still rages
Will you keep fighting when I'm gone

War still rages
Will you keep fighting when I'm gone
Through the ages
Will you keep fighting, when I am dead and gone
Dead and gone

// The Ghost That's Haunting You //

Ghosts surrounding me, they're taking shape
I wake and see them standing there

What the hell (what the hell are you supposed to do)
Are you supposed to do (when the whole world is after you)
When the world (what the hell are you supposed to do)
Is coming after you (when the whole world is after you)

What have I done, what have I become
Standing six feet deep, am I the only one

Save, save yourself
It's killing me to have to say
You know this is the only way

Save, save yourself
There's nothing left to say or do
You know I'll be the ghost that's haunting you

Apparition, read me my last rites
Carry me into the grave
Grave

What the hell (what the hell are you supposed to do)
Are you supposed to do (when the whole world is after you)
When the world (what the hell are you supposed to do)
Is coming after you (when the whole world is after you)

What have I done, what have I become
Standing six feet deep, am I the only one

Save, save yourself
It's killing me to have to say
You know this is the only way

Save, save yourself
There's nothing left to say or do
You know I'll be the ghost that's haunting you

(the ghost that's haunting you)

Save, save yourself
It's killing me to have to say
You know this is the only way

Save, save yourself
There's nothing left to say or do
You know I'll be the ghost that's haunting you

// Pull Me From The Void //

As I descend, I see the end
It's reaching up to pull me in
The bowels of Hell, a prison cell
It's decorated with my sin

I smash the shackles
God above me
Your world is toxic
Now sink and let me be

Pull me from the void
Trapped beneath the tired noise
Pull me from the void
Pathetic world I must destroy

Please, pull me from the void
An uphill battle I must climb
So, pull me from the void
From emptiness you find yourself in time

As I ascend, need not defend
My reasons that I must avenge
A dying dream, unspoken being
I clean myself of you, I'm free

I smash the shackles
God above me
Your world is toxic
Now sink and let me be

Pull me from the void
Trapped beneath the tired noise
Pull me from the void
Pathetic world I must destroy

Please, pull me from the void
An uphill battle I must climb
So, pull me from the void
From emptiness you'll find yourself in time

Revelation
Liberation
Revelation

Pull me from the void
Trapped beneath the tired noise
Pull me from the void
Pathetic world I must destroy

Please, pull me from the void
An uphill battle I must climb
So, pull me from the void
From emptiness you find yourself in time

// Until The World Goes Cold //

As I crawl through dirt and mud
I'm sinking under
In a grave of life that was
I saw a light

I turned my back on everything
I search for half-remembered dreams
Pulling me down with you
Above my head, they're circling
The vultures want what's left of me
I sacrificed it all and I will fight

Until the world goes cold
This battle's burned all that I've known
Until the world goes cold
Nothing will keep me from this throne, I'll fight
Until the world goes cold
Until the world goes cold

As I build my house of bones
You're sinking under
For all your sins you will atone
I've burned it down

I turned my back on everything
I search for half-remembered dreams
Pulling me down with you
(I burned it down)
Above my head, they're circling
The vultures want what's left of me
I sacrificed it all and I will fight

Until the world goes cold
This battle's burned all that I've known
Until the world goes cold
Nothing will keep me from this throne, I'll fight
Until the world goes cold

This battle has burned all
I'll fight forevermore

Until the world goes cold
This battle's burned all that I've known

Until the world goes cold
This battle's burned all that I've known
Until the world goes cold
Nothing will keep me from this throne, I'll fight
Until the world goes cold
Until the world goes cold

Until the world goes cold

// Rise Above The Tides //

She'd rather let the ocean take her inside it's wake
Let the water fill her lungs like the air she hates to breathe
Now lost at sea

Rise, rise above the tides
The waves will pull you under if you don't fight

Slowly sinking to the bottom of the sea
Unconcerned that there's no oxygen since she hates to breathe
Now lost at sea

Rise, rise above the tides
The waves will pull you under if you don't fight
Rise, rise above the tides
Don't allow yourself to give up on life

We're lost forever
Lost together
We're lost forever
Lost together

She'd rather let the ocean take her inside it's wake
Let the water fill her lungs like the air she hates to breathe
Now lost at sea

Find the strength to be
The waves will pull you down, underneath to drown

Rise, rise above the tides
The waves will pull you under if you don't fight
Rise, rise above the tides
Don't allow yourself to give up on life

// The Thing That's Killing Me //

The Devil is in the details
This story is one of betrayal

Ungrateful, unworthy
You are the undeserving
No honor, no valor
No fucking gratitude
You are the wrong that I must right

You are the thing that's killing me
You're poisoning

You are the thing that's killing me
Now I'm here to bury thee

Set fire to the empire
While growing fat off this world

Ungrateful, unworthy
You are the undeserving
No honor, no valor
No fucking gratitude
You are the wrong that I must right

You are the thing that's killing me
You're poisoning

You are the thing that's killing me
Now I'm here to bury thee

[Guitar Solo]

You are the thing that's killing me
Now I can see

You are the thing that's killing me
You're poisoning

You are the thing that's killing me
Now I'm here to bury thee.

// Beneath The Sun //

The sun beats down
Crushing me below its bounding weight

Save me now
Everything is lost inside the storm

I, burn from the inside out
I, look from the inside out

Iâve come undone, beneath the sun
Iâm not the same
When all is lost, at any cost-
Donât fade away

The sky falls down
Cutting out the headstones made of sand

Save me now
Lead me from the temptations of man

I, burn from the inside out
I, look from the inside out

Iâve come undone, beneath the sun
Iâm not the same
When all is lost, at any cost-
Donât fade away

Iâm burning inside
Thereâs no place left to hide
The world I once new
Had been turned to ashes

(Turn and run forever) Iâm burning inside
(We never) Thereâs no place left to hide
(On and on the world must burn)
(And as the ashes we return to dust)

Iâve come undone, beneath the sun
Iâm not the same
When all is lost, at any cost-
Donât fade away

// Breathe In The Flames //

Your kingdom built on lies
Revenge I fantasize
Take me all who oppose
You thought I was disposed

You've shown your true intentions
What kind of man you are

The knifes are sharpening
A co-conspiracy

Poison is treachery
My jude is past the flame
But now you say that I

Breathe in the flames

The walls that built you up
They burn you down the same

Breathe in the flames

The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same

Your throat an open grave
Your tongue used to deceive
With that I'm sinking in
Your kind will never win

You've shown your true intentions
What kind of man you are

The knifes are sharpening
A co-conspiracy

Poison is treachery
My jude is past the flame
But now you say that I

Breathe in the flames

The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same

Breathe in the flames

The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same

Burn you down the same

Breathe in the flames

The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same

Breathe in the flames

The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same

Burn you down the same

// Cease All Your Fire //

Shots fired, tensions grow higher
Both sides claim the other's a liar
These streets will run red

It's the end
It's the end of the world and I can taste it
(No)
It's the end of the world, the fuse is lit

Burn in the flames of the fire
Scream in the night like a choir
So cease all your fire
Cease all your fire
In death, we will all look the same

Brothers at arms due to birthright
Raised in the dark with no foresight
A hate passed down for years

It's the end
It's the end of the world and I can taste it
(No)
It's the end of the world, the fuse is lit

Burn in the flames of the fire
Scream in the night like a choir
So cease all your fire
Cease all your fire
In death, we will all look the same

Itâs the end
(Itâs the end)

Corpses and casings have littered the sands of time
(It's the end)
Women and children and men die at the frontlines
(It's the end)

Burn in the flames of the fire
Scream in the night like a choir

So cease all your fire
Cease all your fire
In death, we will all look the same
So cease all your fire
Cease all your fire
In death, we will all look the same

// The Darkness Of My Mind //

A wreath built of withered roses
How long till it decomposes
I don't think I can make it through this life
Without you
Of all the storms I've had to weather
You were my guiding light
In our last moments spent together
I tried to help you fight

I plead with sorrow
(as it swallows me down)
I'm sinking in misery
(won't you finally let me drown)

The darkness of my mind
Where life and death divide
The ending of mankind
Demise is our design

(A wreath built of withered roses)

I curse the heavens for their thievery
You robbed me of my light
Faith is rewarded with your treachery
I've lost my will to fight

I plead with sorrow
(as it swallows me down)
I'm sinking in misery
(won't you finally let me drown)

The darkness of my mind
Where life and death divide
The ending of mankind
Demise is our design

The darkness of my mind
I seek, what will I find
There's nothing when we die
Fear leave me behind

How much longer must I face
A world imploding, falling grace

How much longer must I face
My self-exploding, I'm erased

Light becomes darkness
Light becomes darkness

Light becomes darkness
Light becomes darkness

(A world imploding, falling grace)

The darkness of my mind
Where life and death divide
The ending of mankind
Demise is our design

The darkness of my mind
I seek, what will I find
There's nothing when we die
Fear leave me behind
