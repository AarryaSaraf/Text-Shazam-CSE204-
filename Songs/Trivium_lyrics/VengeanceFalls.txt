// Brave This Storm //

Have you beheld how our ending befell?
We are the catalyst; engineered hell
The depths we've sunken to
The violent things we do
A cleansing tide would eradicate all of you

How did you think when in apathy's drink
That doing nothing would spare you from the brink
You're equally at fault; now broken by the assault
The righteous, the victims, the villainous ones and all

I know what you're hiding from
I know what you're hiding from

The waves keep crashing over
They pummel me, over and over
I don't think I can ever brave this storm

Should we go quietly?
Accept that all is lost?
I don't think I can ever brave this storm

[Solo: CKB]

Wash us away in the tides of decay
Extinction soon will claim us all as his prey
We're pulled in to the sea; the tempest has been set free
I'm wide awake when the lightning comes beckoning

Burn us alive for our sins and our crimes
We are the wretched ones: malevolent slime
Existing to consume; everything we once knew
Take us, break us, submerge us inside our tomb

I know what you're hiding from
I know what you're hiding from

The waves keep crashing over
They pummel me, over and over
I don't think I can ever brave this storm

Should we go quietly?
Accept that all is lost?
I don't think I can ever brave this storm

This quest is impossible
Brave this storm
I'm feeling my insides pull
Brave this storm

I'm being devoured whole
Brave this storm
My soul is poured in the world
Brave thisâ€¦

[Solo: MKH]

The waves keep crashing over
They pummel me, over and over
I don't think I can ever brave this storm

Should we go quietly?
Accept that all is lost?
I don't think I can ever brave this storm

The waves keep crashing over
They pummel me, over and over
I don't think I can ever brave this storm

Should we go quietly?
Accept that all is lost?
I don't think I can ever brave this storm

// Vengeance Falls //

I am outnumbered
My vision blurred
I'm absorbed by rage
The outcome turns
Bit the hand
Greater man
When you wrought my wrath
Your end began
You broke me down
A shattered crown
I shoveled deep
And tried to drown

This attack
Turned life black
So I built this flame
To burn you back

We start this fire
Just to burn it all
From a dark desire
Our vengeance falls

I have climbed through dirt
Through mud and earth
In this quest for life
I've only hurt
I lost myself
And none could help
Felt unending pain
Perpetual hell
Death arrived
Smile contrived
He pulled me close
But I survived

This attack
Turned life black
Now I own this flame
And burn you back

(And burn you back)

We start this fire
Just to burn it all
From out the pyre
A new life calls

If they build it higher
We will storm their walls
From a dark desire
Our vengeance falls

Vengeance falls (vengeance falls) [6x]

[Solo]

Gathered the strength just to hold it close
Took in the spark that became my pulse
Waited so long just to make you feel
My vengeance now has become so real

We start this fire
Just to burn it all
From out the pyre
A new life calls

If they build it higher
We will storm their walls
From a dark desire
Our vengeance falls

// Strife //

My anxiety's clawing
Out from deep within me
It burns within as my throat begins to cauterize

This negativity's leeching
Any shred of composure
Rationale has decayed and left me bound in madness

I reach for calm
I starve for a balance unknown
This burden tortures me deep in my soul

I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search is all in vain
And I struggle to find my way

How I yearn for the silence
For an end to the voices
The calamity grows and the deafness leads to disarray

Guilt buries me alive
In a coffin - criticized
I shouldered the blame and dug this hole for me to lay in

I reach for calm
I starve for a balance unknown
This burden tortures me deep in my soul

I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search is all in vain
And I struggle to find my way

I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search has been all in vain
And I struggle to find my way

I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search is all in vain
And I struggle to find my way

I've found that strife won't make the bleeding stop
Nor will it take away the pain
I feel like this search has been all in vain
And I struggle to find my way

// No Way To Heal //

I tear your heart out from behind
Remorse has passed us by
You're unaffected, still unaware
Of our damage done

The shame it takes me!
The pain it breaks me!
What have I done?!
Now do I have to!
For all of time now!

I feel the ice cold dagger
Make its way between by ribs again
I stand before disaster
Defiantly alive and suffocate

I''m running on empty
I''m chasing a dead dream
I''m all out of time
Clutching the will
Only to feel
No way to heal

I tried to mend it, to build it back
But the wounds become a scar
You''re lying face down in your burning wreck
The sight won't leave my head

The shame it takes me!
The pain it breaks me!
What have I done?!
Now do I have to!
For all of time now!

I feel the ice cold dagger
Make its way between by ribs again
I stand before disaster
Defiantly alive and suffocate

I''m running on empty
I''m chasing a dead dream
I''m all out of time
Clutching the will
Only to feel
No way to heal

No way to heal!

I stand before disaster
Defiantly alive and suffocate

I''m running on empty
I''m chasing a dead dream
I''m all out of time
Clutching the will
Only to feel
No way to heal

Running on empty
Chasing a dead dream
All out of time
Clutching the will
Only to feel
No way to heal

// To Believe //

As the innocent
Take the punishment
That was really meant
For every one of you

Claim immunity
From the misery
Bark your right to be
Wielding your weapons

Turned a blinded eye
As the children died
Lost within your lie,
Evil defines you

How can you not grieve?
I cannot believe
What has come to be
The land reeks of madness

I can feel it growing inside me
Something that I would never dare speak
Containing the anguish depletes me
Unleashing the anger redeems me

Cannot breathe, cannot breathe
The thoughts won't stop, I cannot breathe
Cannot breathe, cannot breathe
The hardest part was to believe

It amuses me
That you fail to see
What has come to be
A paranoid nation

You cry "terrorist"
With a pounding fist
As your kind assists
Those who would end us

Your version of the truth
Will only benefit you
If you could only view
The dead all around us

You have brought it on
You're the guilty ones
Now we're running from
Our very extinction

I can feel it growing inside me
Something that I would never dare speak
Containing the anguish depletes me
Unleashing the anger redeems me

Cannot breathe, cannot breathe
The thoughts won't stop, I cannot breathe
Cannot breathe, cannot breathe
The hardest part was to believe

[Solo: CKB]

I can feel it growing inside me
Something that I would never dare speak
Containing the anguish depletes me
Unleashing the anger redeems me

Cannot breathe, cannot breathe
The thoughts won't stop, I cannot breathe
Cannot breathe, cannot breathe
The hardest part was to believe

Cannot breathe, cannot breathe
The thoughts won't stop, I cannot breathe
Cannot breathe, cannot breathe
The hardest part was to believe

// At The End Of This War //

There is no life at the end on this war
Soon you will see left with nothing
At the end on this war eternally

You claim me as the living dead
You better aim for my head
You better aim for my head
Consume the flesh make my amends
Into the earth we descend
Into the earth we descend

Do not be afraid
It's only the break
Of all that you laid
Watch as they take

There is no life at the end of this war
Soon you will see left with nothing
At the end of this war eternally

A battle with no end in sight
How can you kill without life
You cannot kill without life
We have brought the fall of man
The blood it covers our hands
It is all over our hands

Do not be afraid
It's only the break
Of all that you laid
Watch as they take

There is no life at the end of this war
Soon you will see left with nothing
At the end of this war eternally

There is no life

There is no life at the end of this war,
Soon you will see,
Left with nothing at the end of this war.
Eternally.

There is no life at the end of this war,
Soon you will see,
Left with nothing at the end of this war.
(At the end of this war!)
Eternally.

// Through Blood And Dirt And Bone //

Die young save yourself
Life is only replaced by hell
I know that the hurt will just go on
I cant save myself

Slowly without a name
As the blood empties from my veins
Nothing ever stays the same I know
I'll always take the blame

I fear I wont make, make it out, out in time
I fear I wont make, make it out, out alive

I'm alone when the ending comes
Take control of the nightmare
This fate has become my own

Choking on my soul
Misery has gained control
Hand in mouth, I start to pull the corpse
That's trapped inside my throat

I want so much to make you feel
All this pain that makes me real
I bring you down to fall with me
Now drown inside of my disease

I fear I wont make, make it out, out in time
I fear I wont make, make it out, out alive

I'm alone when the ending comes
Take control of the nightmare
This fate has become my own

There is no quiet ending
I'll be taking you with me
Through blood and through dirt and bone

Through blood and dirt and bone

Through blood and dirt and bone

I'm alone when the ending comes
Take control of the nightmare
This fate has become my own

There is no quiet ending
I'll be taking you with me
Through blood and through dirt and bone

Through blood and through dirt and bone

Through blood and through dirt and bone

// Villainy Thrives //

I can feel it aching within every bone inside me
I can feel it breaking out retaliation: released
I need to cause the evil-doers' suffering
Can't wait to choke the life out from your baneful bodies

If only I could afflict you
Hurt you in the same way that you hurt
I just want to exact reprisal
Retribution calls

The only way I depict you
Is that your redemption's undeserved
Meet the vessel of your reprisal
Retribution calls

It's not that I take life for granted
It's only that the good won't make it
Innocence dies while Villainy Thrives

How can you harm a living thing thinking that it's your right?
How can you defile a life deprive it of innocence?
For too long you have gotten away with murder
A fitting justice would be your painful execution

If only I could afflict you
Hurt you in the same way that you hurt
I just want to exact reprisal
Retribution calls

The only way I depict you
Is that your redemption's undeserved
Meet the vessel of your reprisal
Retribution calls

It's not that I take life for granted
It's only that the good won't make it
Innocence dies while Villainy Thrives

I want to ruin the rapist
Punish the criminal
Violate the abuser
End the murderer

[Solo]

It's not that I take life for granted
It's only that the good won't make it
Innocence dies while Villainy Thrives

It's not that I take life for granted
It's only that the good won't make it
Innocence dies while Villainy Thrives

// Incineration: The Broken World //

They're straight from the booklet. Enjoy!
Incineration: The Broken World
I am but a fragment
The lesser part of something more
this division leaves me
incomplete

I long for completion
To be reassembled; detached
I am the obsolete

Those who create for
Another's need
Will never revel
They'll only bleed

Surrounding encumbrance
Coerced habitation with those
I cannot stand to be near

Ironically scathing
This life that I work so hard for
Keeps me from what I need

Voracious packs
Only exist to feed
Off everything that
I have in me

Collapsing upon myself
The light burned out so very
Long ago
So long ago
It's plain to see

So watch as I spiral down
Collide and crash into the
Broken world

Descend downwards into
The dark
Are you not entertained by
The fall?
Only misery enthralls

All my sadness and pain
On display
It's the only way you'd ever
Need me
The only way you would
Believe me

Collapsing upon myself
The light burned out so very
Long ago
So long ago
It's plain to see

So watch as I spiral down
Collide and crash into the
Broken world
Broken world
You've broken me

Collapsing upon myself
The light burned out so very
Long ago
So long ago
It's plain to see

So watch as I spiral down
Collide and crash into the
Broken world

// Wake (The End Is Nigh) //

With my hands around your throat,
that's the way I like you most.
When you're choking on the feelings rushing out.

I just want to hate,
the same way that you hate,
So that I don't feel this love no more.

Choking on the feelings rushing out,
I'm choking feelings rushing out.

Time won't open up its wings,
Let me fall from grace
And lend into the flames.

I don' want to feel this love go cold,
I don't know how you opened this light before.

Choking on the feelings rushing out,
I'm choking on the feelings rushing out!

(Wake!)
It's only getting worse,
(Wake!)
Behold this bitter curse,
(Wake!)
It's only getting worse, the end is nigh.

(Wake!)
It's only getting worse,
(Wake!)
Behold this bitter curse,
(Wake!)
It's only getting worse, the end is nigh.

Take it away, every second of pain,
Like a stake through my brain.
Existence, inhumane.

Am I awake or dreaming?
Is this the life we're breaking?
Why stay alive when dying is much easier?

(Wake!)
It's only getting worse,
(Wake!)
Behold this bitter curse,
(Wake!)
It's only getting worse, the end is nigh.

(Wake!)
It's only getting worse,
(Wake!)
Behold this bitter curse,
(Wake!)
It's only getting worse, the end is nigh.

Take it away, every second of pain,
Like a stake through my brain.
Existence, inhumane.

Am I awake or dreaming?
Is this the life we're breaking?
Why stay alive when dying is much easier?

Am I awake or dreaming?
Is this the life we're breaking?
Why stay alive when dying is much easier?

It's not gonna end the way you want,
The end is nigh,
It's not gonna end the way you want,
The end is nigh.

Wasted away, every second and day,
Trying to ascertain our dominion in faith.

It's not gonna end the way you want,
The end is nigh, the end is nigh!

The end is nigh [5x]

// No Hope For The Human Race //

Indoctrinate
The uneducated with your 
Scriptures of hate
Manipulation mastered - threat of pain
Dissimulate
Your true intentions with a 
Fiction, ornate
Those who don't believe are all to blame

I'm beaten down
Will - taken away
I cannot face another day
I've lost my ground
Standing face to face
I'll never see my home again
There is no hope for the human race
We are flawed
Searching for God
There is no hope for the human race

Condemnation
Expelled at everyone that
You find different
Breeding the abhorrence that will lead to war
Masturbation
You utlize your slaves for
Decimation
A faith not of love, but of fear and gore

I'm beaten down
Will - taken away
I cannot face another day
I've lost my ground
Standing face to face
I'll never see my home again
There is no hope for the human race
We are flawed
Searching for God
There is no hope for the human race
Mask your cause
Killers we are
There is no hope for the human race

There is no hope for the human race
We are flawed
Searching for God
There is no hope for the human race
Mask your cause
Killers we are
There is no hope for the human race

// As I Am Exploding //

Every single day that I have to live with you
Is a struggle I no longer can get through
And every time I cast aside evil
It comes on crawling back anew
You will never comprehend how it hurts to be
To be tormented by everything that I see
The violence I foresee permeates everything
I've become bound completely

I can't stand this suffering anymore
Why won't it end?
No one hears me, no one sees this war
Raging in me

Life can't keep going on this way
I feel I'm lost inside my hate
My thoughts overtake me
They're killing me faster with each passing day

Can't imagine what it's like to be all of you
Living under a shroud of complacency
The world is worse than you ever could now
The truth would be the thing that killed you

What I could prevent all of your suffering
Indiscriminate absolute purging
Do I have what it takes to be shepherd for
Everything that I deplore

I can't stand this suffering anymore
Why won't it end
No one hears me, no one sees this war
Raging in me

Life can't keep going on this way
I feel I'm lost inside my hate
My thoughts overtake me
They're killing me faster with each passing day
Life can't keep going on this way
I feel I'm lost inside my hate
My thoughts overtake me
They're killing me faster with each passing day

Slowly, I'm burning
Inside - imploding
World keeps on turning
As I'm exploding

Life can't keep going on this way
I feel I'm lost inside my hate
My thoughts overtake me
They're killing me faster with each passing day
Life can't keep going on this way
I feel I'm lost inside my hate
My thoughts overtake me
They're killing me faster with each passing day

Slowly, I'm burning
Inside - imploding
World keeps on turning
As I'm exploding
Slowly, I'm burning
Inside - imploding
World keeps on turning
As I'm exploding

// Skulls...We Are 138 //

Corpses all hang headless and limp
Bodies with no surprises
And the blood drains down like devil's rain
We'll bathe tonight

I want your skull
I need your skull
I want your skull
I need your skull

Demon I am and face I peel
To see your skin turned inside out, 'cause,
Gotta have you on my wall
Gotta have you on my wall,

'Cause I want your skull
I need your skull
I want your skull
I need your skull

Collect the heads of little girls and put 'em on my wall
Hack the heads off little girls and put 'em on my wall

I want your skull
I need your skull [x4]

We are 138, we are 138, we are 138
We are 138, we are 138, we are 138
We are 138, we are 138
In the eyes of tiger

Do you think we're robot clean
Does this face look almost mean
Is it time to be an android not a man

The pleasantries are gone
We're stripped of all we were
In the eyes of tiger

We are 138, we are 138, we are 138
We are 138, we are 138, we are 138
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
