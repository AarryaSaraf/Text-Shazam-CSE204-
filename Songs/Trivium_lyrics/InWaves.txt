// Capsizing The Sea //

Ravenous white, boiling over
Capsizing the sea
Colossal wake left earth
Asunder
Capsizing the sea

// In Waves //

In waves
In waves
In waves
In waves

Do I end this all for the world to see?
In waves, In waves
Do I take everybody else down? (everybody else down)
Everybody else down with me

In waves
In waves
In waves
In waves

Do I end this all for the world to see?
In waves, In waves
Do I take everybody else down? (everybody else down)
Everybody else down with me
I know that death approaches fast
In waves, In waves
What's the purpose if this life won't last? (what's the purpose?)
Pulling everyone down with me

Perpetually
Perpetually we're igniting in waves (igniting in waves)
Incessantly
Incessantly we're sinking in flames (flames)

// Inception Of The End //

Fire
Alight the new beginning
Desire
Make this life worth living

Hands are shaking
Heart is breaking
It's for the taking
Every single thing

Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear

Fire
Cleanse the world that would hold me back
Desire
By throat I release you
Goodbye

Hands are shaking
Heart is breaking
It's for the taking
Every single thing

Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear

Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear

We start this fire
We start this fire
The way we always do

We start this fire
The way we always do
Let the flames consume

The way we always do
Let the flames consume

Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear

Don't lose focus
Because we are halfway there
Inception of the end
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear
Sacrifice all your fear

// Dusk Dismantled //

We are the insect
We are the insect, breeding
We are the insect
We are the insect, breeding

A fire burns
In the back of
The throat
Let it out, let it out
Before the
Choke

Dusk dismantled
Combustion's convergence with our existence
Dusk dismantled
We are the infinitesimal

Bursting inside out
Bursting from the inside out
Bursting inside out
Bursting from the inside out

I dig a hole
Through what's left of
My world
Searching for, something more
I turn it
Inwards

Dusk dismantled
Combustion's convergence with our existence
Dusk dismantled
We are the infinitesimal

I'm falling, I'm falling
In this colossal void
Each day that I spent digging downward
Built me up for a higher fall

Dusk dismantled
Combustion's convergence with our existence
Dusk dismantled
We are the infinitesimal

Dusk dismantled
Dusk dismantled
Dusk dismantled
Dusk dismantled
Combustion's convergence with our existence

// Watch The World Burn //

If we all fall down
We fall before moving wheels
Crushed between the gears
If we fall in line
We see that this path leads straight
Into the great machine

If we all fall down
We're swallowed by hopelessness
Digested by their need
If we fall in line
We're cycled through as the blood
Keeping it alive

I cannot take it anymore
I feel it bleed out on the floor
You are a lost cause
You are a lost cause

Watch the world burn
It sets the air on fire
Watch the world burn
We are the arson

If we break their hold
We open our arms to fight
Unleashing the light
If we stand our ground
We become the enemy
The revolution sounds

If we break their hold
We're faced down by everything
Challenged with a war
If we stand our ground
We're sacrificing ourselves
To save so much more

I cannot take it anymore
I feel it bleed out on the floor
You are a lost cause
You are a lost cause

Watch the world burn
It sets the air on fire
Watch the world burn
We are the arson

Watch the world burn
It sets the air on fire
Watch the world burn
We are the arson

Holding the breath now
Don't make a sound
Don't make a sound

We are the arson
We burn it down
We burn it down

I cannot take it anymore
I feel it bleed out on the floor
You are a lost cause
You are a lost cause

Watch the world burn
It sets the air on fire
Watch the world burn
We are the arson

Watch the world burn
It sets the air on fire
Watch the world burn
We are the arson

// Black //

Decomposing in this worthless tomb,
Nothingness inhaled, I am consumed.
Starving for the ending to this doom,
We the parasite, our death overdue.

Black!
It's opening.
Oh, how it stares!
So deep,
Into the soul,
So deep into the soul!

Black!
Downfall of decimation!
Black!
It tears apart the night!

Termination sits across my cell,
Waiting patiently to unleash Hell.
Frothing at the mouth, it's hunger tells,
Of the feast I'll soon become, my soul melts.

Black!
It's opening.
Oh, how it stares!
So deep,
Into the soul,
So deep into the soul!

Black!
Downfall of decimation!
Black!
It tears apart the night!

Oh!

Rain, rain down,
On, this hopeless, scorched abyss.
Rain down,
Termination's, all we're owed.
Rain down, rain, rain down!

Black!
It's opening.
Oh, how it stares!
So deep,
Into the soul,
So deep into the soul!

Black!
Downfall of decimation!
Black!
It tears apart the night!

// A Skyline's Severance //

I am
Disintegrating
As I set fire
To the
Life that I once knew
In my last stand

To break free
From the ghost of me
I burn it down
A past life to the ground

A skyline's severance
Cleave from creation's hands
A skyline's severance

Dying
Seemed appropriate
For the old me
Living
Was so much harder
Lone and longing

To break free
From the ghost of me
I burn it down
A past life to the ground

A skyline's severance
Cleave from creation's hands
A skyline's severance

It hurts
So much to feel alive
To feel the tide
Breaking down, these waves will
Drown
It hurts
So much to feel alive
To feel the tide
Breaking down, these waves will
Drown

A skyline's severance
Cleave from creation's hands
A skyline's severance

Cleave from creation's hands

// Built To Fall //

You are a cancer spreading its wings
So selfishly unaware to the things
Your existence is doing to my well-being
I feel my heart leaking

(You!) Start as a fissure, a crack in the skin
(You!) Become an ulcer permeating
If I had known all that you'd do
Would it hasten, what I'd do to you?

I don't want to hate you, but how could I not?
You killed off so much I held dear in my heart

Take away every single pain (single pain!)
That infects each and every day (everyday!)
I will bury you once and for all
You're a monster, you're built to fall
You're built to fall!

It's getting harder and harder to breathe
Choking on the same air as a walking disease
You are the thing that's killing me
From the inside out, let me be

I don't want to hate you,
But you killed off everything in my heart

Take away every single pain (single pain!)
That infects each and every day (everyday!)
I will bury you once and for all
You're a monster, you're built to fall

You've got your war against my head
Push that button, make it end
You've got your war against my head

You've got your war against my head
Push that button, make it end
You've got your war against my head
Push that button, make it end!

[Solo]

Take away every single pain (single pain!)
That infects each and every day (everyday!)
I will bury you once and for all
You're a monster, you're built to fall

(You're built to fall! You're built to fall!)
You're built to fall
(You're built to fall! You're built to fall!)
You're built to fall

// Caustic Are The Ties That Bind //

It's we the people
Who spawned this rage
The violent people
Who dawned this age

Who dawned this age

Convulse and kill
Tremble, blood spills
Ruination
Our divination

Caustic are the ties that bind
Like barbed wire, taut and fine
Tied around the wrists that
Plead
Crimson for the dark to feed

Why can't we see
What's come to be
We broke the lifeblood
We're drowned in death's flood
We're drowned in death's flood

Convulse and kill
Tremble, blood spills
Ruination
Our divination

Caustic are the ties that bind
Like barbed wire, taut and fine
Tied around the wrists that
Plead
Crimson for the dark to feed

Caustic are the ties that bind

It surges through us all
A lack of self-control
A sighing, vacant soul

Plunged headfirst in the deep
Nothing for us to keep
Only sounding a weep

Can you help me find my way
I've been lost for so long
I don't even know where it went wrong
Can you help me
Can you help me

Find strength to armor me
To face my enemies
A whispered, draining plea

Can you help me find my way
I've been lost for so long
I don't even know where it went wrong
Can you help me
Can you help me

Caustic are the ties that bind
Like barbed wire, taut and fine
Tied around the wrists that plead
Crimson for the dark to feed
Caustic are the ties that bind

// Forsake Not The Dream //

Been down this road
Too many times
Been down this road
Too many times

You taught me how
It feels to die
You taught me how
Feels to die

We learned
What it feels like
To feel pain
For the first time [x2]

We learned
What it feels like
To suffer
Feels like to suffer

Give me the strength
To face what's in front of you
In front of me
I am your length
To face what's in front of you
In front of me.

I watch it fall before my eyes
This ring we built for all our lives

We learned
What it feels like
To feel pain
For the first time

We learned
What it feels like
To suffer
Feels like to suffer

Give me the strength
To face what's in front of you
In front of me
I am your length
To face what's in front of you
In front of me.

Vanquish that which kills you darling
Forsake not the dream
Through the world I feel I've fallen
Forsake not the dream

Crestfallen
Another crestfallen
Collide and collapse

Crestfallen
Another crestfallen
Collide and collapse

Give me the strength
To face what's in front of you
In front of me
I am your length
To face what's in front of you
In front of me.

Vanquish that which kills you darling
Forsake not the dream
Through the world I feel I've fallen
Forsake not the dream

Forsake
Forsake
Forsake
Forsake not the dream

Forsake
Forsake
Forsake
Forsake not the dream

// Drowning In Slow Motion //

Drowning in slow motion
Drowning in slow motion

It's what I need
A place to freely bleed

All behold the bloodshed
Down upon your knees
All extol the godsend
Construction or divine

I feel there's no place left to hide
From myself, I am left behind
Drowning in slow motion
Is this fate imagined?
I feel there's no place left to hide

Taken from me
My willingness to breathe

All behold the bloodshed
Down upon your knees
All extol the godsend
Construction or divine

I feel there's no place left to hide
From myself, I am left behind
Drowning in slow motion
Is this fate imagined?
I feel there's no place left to hide

Blackened horizon
Light has withdrawn

Blackened horizon
Light has withdrawn
Blackened horizon
Light has withdrawn

I feel there's no place left to hide
From myself, I am left behind
Drowning in slow motion
Is this fate imagined?

I feel there's no place left to hide
From myself, I am left behind
Drowning in slow motion
Is this fate imagined?
I feel there's no place left to hide
From myself, I am left behind

// A Grey So Dark //

Ripping out the feelings used to
Hold me in to place
Breaking through the
Structures, I unfold at my
Disgrace

I'm digging deeper
To lay my misery down
Into the water
So that it may drown

A grey
A grey so dark
It moves in silence and kills
Again
A grey
A grey so dark
I lose myself and embrace the
End

Swallowing the ashes of a newly
Burned down dream
Tasting only charred remains of
Cured and better me

I'm digging deeper
To lay my misery down
Into the water
So that it may drown

A grey
A grey so dark
It moves in silence and kills
Again
A grey
A grey so dark
I lose myself and embrace the
End

I burst, not bleed
I'm pulled into the undertow
I burst, not bleed
I'm swallowed by the great below

A grey
A grey so dark
It moves in silence and kills
Again
A grey
A grey so dark
I lose myself and embrace the
End

A grey so dark
(Still blinding me)
A grey so dark
(Still blinding me)
A grey so dark
(Still blinding me)
A grey so dark

// Chaos Reigns //

I built these wings
With broken things
Found strewn in me
My nemeses

Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns

I break and bleed
I tear, then feed
The wretchedness
Inside of me

Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns

I know where my hate truly hides
Front and center behind these
Eyes

Chaos

Reigns

It bites and holds
With fangs, so old
That loathsomeness
So bitter cold

Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns

// Of All These Yesterdays //

Take away all of this pain,
Life feels like it's all in vain,
Life feels like it's all in vain,
Blindingly, it seeps through the trees
Burning bright, subconscious streams
Falling light, dismantled dreams

We are too far gone,
We are too far gone,
We are too far gone,
We were, never meant to make it this far. [2x]

I feel the rage,
And it burns the pages,
Of all these yesterdays.

We are all damaged and wrong,
Like to sing for death alone,
Like to sing for death alone,
Hope has gone cold with its cause,
Lost inside its every flaw,
Life is finally swallowed raw.

We are too far gone,
We are too far gone,
We are too far gone,
We were, never meant to make it this far.

I feel the rage,
And it burns the pages,
Of all these yesterdays.

I'm covered fast,
In the falling ashes,
Of all these yesterdays.

With the end in sight,
I clench what's left of light
Press it against my head
And dream of the color red. [2x]

I feel the rage,
And it burns the pages,
Of all these yesterdays.

I'm covered fast,
In the falling ashes,
Of all these yesterdays.

I feel the rage,
And it burns the pages,
Of all these yesterdays.

Iâm covered fast,
In the falling ashes,
Of all these yesterdays.

We are too far gone,
We are too far gone,
We are too far gone,
We were, never meant to make it this far.

// Leaving This World Behind //

Could someone please erase me
Take my body from this hell
I don't know how it started
But I sure know how it fell

We dug our graves real deep
Surrounded by our moats
Such a shame, oh such a shame
Our sins won't help us float

I'm leaving this world behind
Making up for all our crimes
I'm leaving this world behind
Making up for all our crimes
I'm leaving this world behind
Making up for all our crimes

Making up for all our crimes
Making up for all our crimes
Making up for all our crimes
Making up for all our crimes

// Shattering The Skies Above //

Take me into the seas
So I can clean off this disease
Death will complete me
It's what I need

Take my evil to the skies
Take my evil; all light dies

Shattering the skies above
I want to destroy all that you love
Shattering the skies above
I won't rest 'til I am drenched in blood

// Slave New World //

Face the enemy
Stare inside you
Control your thoughts
Destroy, destroy 'em all

You censor what we breathe
Prejudice with no belief
Senseless violence all around
Who is it that keeps us down, down?

Once all free tribes
Chained down, led lives
Blood boils inside me
We're not slaves, we're free

Face the enemy
Stare inside you
Control your thoughts
Destroy, destroy 'em all
