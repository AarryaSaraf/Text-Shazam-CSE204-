// Pain //

Bleed my life to the concrete
Living is the strain
Cutting will from every vein
Conceived hate through the beatings
Your hate publicized
Shot for looking in your eyes

Throw my mind through dissection
Dismembering
Razorblade caressing

Consummation of falsehood
Feeding on their ways
Subhuman, be thy name

Headfirst, slammed to the concrete
Teeth grip the street
Inflamed rage you shall meet
Anger's smoke smells so sweet
Left torn and slain
Vengeance, be thy name

Throw my mind through dissection
Dismembering
Razorblade caressing

Cut scarred wrist
Drain you, pain
Shoot maimed mind
Kill you, pain

Pain

Cut scarred wrist
Drain you, pain
Shoot maimed mind
I'm in you

Pain
Pain
Pain

// Thrust //

Point at the object
Of your new hate affection
Raped and slashed
Are now my hopes and dreams, oh, yeah
Drink up and marvel
You're my new hate infection
Loathing in my vision, nothing's as it seems
Take a mind, crush a soul

Thrust
Thrust
Thrust

Puke out, shoot in
Time for your masquerade
You watch bodies rot in
Your seas of laughter and hate
We don't give a damn about your thought-parade
Another thing you did forget
We're not like you; we're not for sale
Oh, coming for you, pain, take in

Feeding off lies and hatred
Why did we put up with these games?
Now we are bigger than you're ever going to be
Now I watch you fall, so down into the ground
Your time is done, coming for you, pain, take in

Thrust
Thrust
Thrust
Thrust

// Lake Of Fire //

Take fallen lamb, chained by his hand
He hath come for your life
Inside your sleep, vile images creep
Hear the screams that haunt your soul

Follow the reaper
Searching for...
Stand at the gates
Hail to thee

Lake of fire
Tell me of the souls you have drowned
Demon priest
On their knees, they are praying to you

Purge innards, little child
Binge the vile, thrashing limbs for a while
Possessed, ripped and torn, your flesh is worn
Losing control of your own

Shackled down
Burning for...
Nailed down in blood
Hail to thee

Lake of fire
Tell me of the souls you have drowned
Demon priest
On their knees, they are praying to you

Staring in the eyes of hell
Blood and bone, my holding cell
I stand forth to the dark horde
I am food for the dark lord

Lake of fire
Tell me of my soul you have drowned
Demon priest
On my knees, I am praying to you
