// Head On / Pill //

[Head On]

Just yesterday I sat across from my legs
They weren't connected to me
And I couldn't see 'cause my eyes weren't in me
Hold me up straight while I screw my

Head on
Head on

Just yesterday I held a cup to my lips
Pouring it deep in my throat
Filling up me like a black enemy
Hold me up straight while I screw my

Head on
Head on
Head on
Head on

// I'm Not A Man Unless I Have A Woman //

Well, I'm not a man unless I have a woman
Well, I'm not a man unless I have a woman (Oh, woman)

She's a hundred pounds of gold (Yes I am)
She's a hundred pounds of gold
Well I got mine, so I don't mind, no

Oh, and I'm not a woman unless I have a man
Oh, and I'm not a woman unless I have a man, oh

I ain't gonna break your heart
Because I'm done breaking hearts

Well, I'm not a man unless I have a woman
Well, I'm not a man unless I have a woman, oh

She's a hundred pounds of gold
(He's a hundred pounds of gold)
She's a hundred pounds of gold
(He's a hundred pounds of gold)
Well I got mine, so I don't mind, no

I ain't gonna break your heart
(Yeah, I know you won't)
Because I'm done breaking hearts, oh, ho

// God Is Calling Me Back Home //

Well meet me at the house on the top of the hill
I've got two important people that I'm ready to kill

Well I'll just flunk or fail so give me something better to do
Well I'll just flunk or fail so give me something better to do

Well, Santa's on the roof, with his presents and sack
He's got one hand with a blade and the other's an axe

Well I'll just flunk or fail so give me something better to do
Well I'll just flunk or fail so give me something better to do

Then I hear God call, and all my hate is gone
I hear Him calling me back home!

Oh, I hear God call, and now my hate is gone
I heard Him calling me back home!
Calling me back home, calling me back home
Calling me back home, calling me, back home!
God!
Well, God is calling me back home...
Is calling me back home, is calling me back home
Calling me, back home!
Well, God is calling me back home
Is calling me back home, is calling me back home
Is calling me back home, is calling me back home
Is calling me back home, is calling me back home
Is calling me back home, is calling me back home
Is calling me back home (Is calling me back home)
Is calling me back home (Is calling me back home)
Is calling me back home (Is calling me back home)
Is calling me back home (Is calling me back home)
Is calling me back home (Is calling me back home)
Is calling me back home (Is calling me back home)
Is calling me back home
Is calling me, back home!

// 30 Past 7 //

At 30 past 7 you know I could be better
At 30 past 2 I'll get along with you

I'm grumpy in the morning
You know that when I'm yawning, it's true
That I'll be snappy towards you
That I'll bite pieces out of you

At 30 past 7, 30 past 7
30 past 7, 30 past 7
30 past 2, 30 past 2
30 past 2, 30 past 2

I'm grumpy in the morning
You know that when I'm yawning, it's true
That I'll be snappy towards you
That I'll bite pieces out of you
Bite pieces out of you, bite pieces out of you
Bite pieces out of you (bite pieces out of you)
Bite pieces, out of you

// Let Me Mend The Past //

Let me mend the past
Let me see behind your mask
You finally go around
She stares at the ground
And acts if you're not there

Lock's on the door
Surveillance when you enter in the hall
Such a pointless cause
Her cups on my wall
It's hard to be ignored

Let me mend the past
And make ends meet at last
Before they bleed
Don't wanna come across too weak

Let me mend the past
Let me see behind your mask
You finally go around
She stares at the ground
And acts if you're not there

Let me mend the past
And make ends meet at last
Before they bleed
Don't wanna come across too weak

Let me mend the past
Let me mend the past
This will be the last time I ask
Let me mend the past

// Mystery Jack //

I am my mother's son
And I'll keep doin' 'til the done gets done
I wouldn't steal for free
And I won't see you next to me

'Cause I, oh, I
I, oh, I
Hope I don't wake up

'Cause I'm a lonely soul
And I've got no friends on this road
And I'm a mystery Jack
The lines on my hands tell me I'm on track

To die, oh, die
I, oh, I
Hope I don't wake up

I, oh, I
I, oh, I
Hope I don't wake up, I hope I don't wake up
I hope I don't wake up, I hope I don't wake up

// Pop In My Step //

Gonna shake the world, shake the world off my back
I'm gonna hold my head high with the sun on my track

Today I've got no troubles in sight

Gonna put some pop in my step when I walk
I'm gonna show my mood off when I walk and I talk

Today I've got no troubles in sight
Gonna turn around, make everything that was wrong into right

Gonna look past things that I know I'll regret
Cause life's a little too short for those worries
You can bet on me

Today I've got no troubles in sight
Gonna turn around, make everything that was wrong into
Right, right

When I wake up late in the morning, you'll know
It takes a few more hours before I'll know

Today I've got no troubles in sight
Gonna turn around, make everything that was wrong into
Right, right, right, right

// Float Along - Fill Your Lungs //

I saw you in the carpet shades
Then I felt you like a baby's face

Just float along and fill your lungs
Just float along and breathe a deep breath

I saw you in the paper folds
Then I saw you in my coffee mug

Just float along and fill your lungs
Just float along and breathe a deep breath

Just float along and fill your lungs
Just float along and fill your lungs
Just float along and breathe a deep breath
Just float along and fill your lungs
