// Buddy's Rendezvous //

Everybody's girl
What's the point in
Being everybody's girl?
Maybe you think that way
There's no chance getting hurt
Living for no one cost me way
More than it's worth

So you're gonna be a singer
Well I'll be goddamn
You're as pretty as a postcard
No thank to the old man
It's the same coat I had on
The night that I went in
I can stay an hour at Canter's
The streets cool off by then

When can I see you again?
Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Everything you want
What's the fun in getting
Everything you want?
I wouldn't know but, look
Baby you should try
Forget that lefty shit
Your mom drilled in your mind

Give the world a new savior
Sell his pictures to the press
Buy a place out in the country
Leave this world for
Someone else
My destruction is an hour late
I'm at Buddy's Rendezvous
Telling the losers
And old-timers
How good I did with you
They almost believe me too
Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news
Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Whatever happened
Whatever happened

// Awful Things //

Julian is gonna take my files
Every woman that I've slept with
Every friendship I've neglected
Didn't come when grandma died
I spent my folk bucks getting drunk and high
I've done things unprotected
Proceeded to drive home wasted
Bought things to win over siblings
I've said awful things, such awful things

And now, now it's out
And now, now it's out

Julian he's gonna take my files
Telling people jokes to shut them up
Resenting people that I love
Sleep in til two then doing shit
Just stay in bed and later lie about it
Obsessing over graying hair
Knowing just what people wanna hear
Binging on unearned attention
I've said awful things, such awful things

And now, now it's out
And now, now it's out

I came by at seven in the morning
Seven in the morning, seven in the morning
I came by at seven in the morning
I said baby I'm finally succumbing
Said something dumb like I'm tired of running
Tired of running, tired of running
Let's put a baby in the oven
Wouldn't I make the ideal husband

// Chateau Lobby #9 //

Emma eats bread and butter
Like a queen would have ostrich and cobra wine
We'll casually take ecstasy
And play piano in the chateau lobby

I've never done this
Baby be gentle
It's my first time
I've got you inside

People are boring
But you're something else completely
Damn let's take our chances

I wanna take you in the kitchen
Lift up your wedding dress someone was probably murdered in
So bourgeoisie to keep waiting
Dating for twenty years just feels pretty civilian
I've never thought that
Ever thought that once in my whole life
You are my first time

People are boring
But you're something else I can't explain
You take my last name

First time you let me stay the night
Despite your own rules
You took off early to go cheat your way through film school
You left a note in your perfect script
Stay as long as you want
I haven't left your bed since

I haven't hated all the same things
As somebody else since I remember 
What's going on for
What are you doing with your whole life
How about forever
How about forever

// Everything Is Free //

Everything is free now
That's what they say
Everything I ever done
Gotta give it away
Someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That we're gonna do it anyway
Even if doesn't pay

I can get a tip jar
Gas up the car
And try to make a little change
Down at the bar
Or I can get a straight job
I've done it before
I never minded working hard
It's who I'm working for

Everything is free now
That's what they say
Everything I ever done
Gotta give it away
Someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That I'm gonna do it anyway
Even if doesn't pay

Every day I wake up
Hummin' a song
But I don't need to run around
I just stay home
And sing a little love song
My love, to myself
If there's something that you want to hear
You can sing it yourself

'Cause everything is free now
That what I said
No one's got to listen to
These words in my head
Someone hit the big score
They figured it out
That we're gonna do it anyway
Even if doesn't pay

// Holy Hell //

Hell
Holy hell, holy hell
Damn, the future ain't looking so bright
Never asked for a paradise
But seventy years would be nice
With my brothers and sisters and I
And the impossible dream of mankind
But I've always been the irrational type

Hell
What the hell, what the hell
This thing's got us all in its grip
The economy just don't explain this
This unfathomable, nameless rift
Who knows if it even exists
It just some highly effective rhetoric
Used by perverts who get off on it

But all my friends
Yeah, I'm talking to you
The world won't end unless we want it to
There's no one in control
And it's our life to choose

// I Believe (When I Fall In Love It Will Be Forever) //

Shattered dreams
Worthless years
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell
Life began
Then was done
Now I stare into a cold and empty well

The many sounds that meet our ears
The sights our eyes behold
Will open up our merging hearts
And feed our empty souls

I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time
It will be forever

Without despair
We will share
And the joys of caring will not be replaced
What has been
Must never end
And with the strength we have will not be erased

When the truths of love are planted firm
They won't be hard to find
And the words of love I speak to you
Will echo in your mind

I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time
It will be forever

I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time
It will be forever

I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time
It will be forever

// I Would Love You //

I would love a man, if my genes were just a little different
I would love a man, and not think twice at all
When I loved that man, like any woman loves her lover
I would love a man, now if I could just love you

I would wed a girl, if I was just a little less married
I would wed a girl, if I could ever be anywhere on time
I would wed a girl, but there'd be a mistress at the altar
I would wed a girl, now if I could just wed you

If everything I've sung 'til now is false, please let this one be true
If everything I've sung 'til now is false, you can tell 'em
"This one's true"

I would wed a horse, if I was just a little more lonely
I would love that horse, if I'd been exiled from mankind
I would love that horse, and I would take comfort in its presence
I would love a horse, now do you still love me?

// Josh Tillman And The Accidental Dose //

She put on Astral Weeks
Said "I love Jazz", and winked at me
This is the last place I oughta be
But I can't drive, and I sure can't sleep
Around this time, I publicly
Well, nevermind, you can read
I was unwell, and suddenly
Her clown portraits spoke to me

You're in no shape
You're in no shape
All the kings horses, all the kings men
You may never be whole again

A publicist and a celibate started talking
Politics
By a small degree, she got him to admit
They're tacit fascists
Without knowing it
An oldest went on and on
Performance art, an elaborate con
Baby, who wears pearls at four AM?
This pitching yuppie found meanings and

You're in no shape
In no shape
All the kings horses, all the kings men
You may never be whole again
You may never be whole again
You may never be whole again

I saw something I shouldn't see
The awful truth, babe, reality
That I'd forfeit my existence
If someone let me just play with them
Dawn long broke by the time
I realized that I lost my mind
I ate an ice cream
Dazed in the street
But it never taste quite as sweet
Again
Again

// Main Man //

Are you my main man
Are you now, are you now?
Are you my main man
Are you now, are you now?
Are you now?

Are you a God man
Are you now, are you now?
Are you a frog man
Are you now are you now?
Are you now?

Oh and heaven is hot babe
Ever so, ever so
And heaven is hot babe
Watch it glow, watch it glow
Watch it glow

Bolan likes to rock, yeah
Yeah he does, yes he does
Bolan likes to rock now
Yes he does, yes he does
Yes he does

Is there a sane man
Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere?
I got giraffes all up in my hair
And I don't care, I don't care
I don't care

And as a child I laughed a lot
Yes I did, yes I did
Now it seems I cry a lot
Oh tell me true don't you

And are you my main man
Are you now, are you now?
Are you my main man
Are you now, are you now?
Are you now?

Are you my main man
Are you now, are you now?
Are you my main man
Are you now, are you now?
Are you now?

// Malaprops //

Oh I just love the kind of woman who can walk over a man
I mean like a goddamn marching band
She says like literally music is the air she breathes
And the malaprops make me wanna fucking scream
I wonder if she even knows what that word means
Well it's literally not that

Of the few main things I hate about her
One's her petty vogue ideas
Someone's been told too many times they're beyond their years
By every half-wit of distinction she keeps around
And now every insufferable convo
Features her patiently explaining the cosmos
Of which she is in the middle

Oh my god I swear this never happens
Lately I can't stop the wheels from spinning
I feel so unconvincing
When I fumble with your buttons

She blames her excess on my influence
But gladly hoovers all my drugs
I found her naked with her best friend in the tub
And we sang Silent Night in three parts which was fun
Until she said that she sounds just like Sarah Vaughan
I hate that soulful affectation white girls put on
Why don't you move to the delta

I obliged later on when you begged me to choke you

// Nothing Hurts Worse //

Every time I tune up this thing 
I'm reminded of what it feels like to break a string
And my hand reacts like a wounded woman
And nothing hurts worse

Baby, be patient with me
Please don't get angry 
If I can't stay
Oh I'd love to see you in the daylight 
Before we book the chapel
Before I make you my wife

Every time I climb the riser to drum
I'm reminded of what a song writing failure I've become
And my pride reacts like a wounded woman
And nothing hurts worse

Guys, be patient with me
Please don't get angry 
When I act that way
Oh I'd break some bottles and celebrate
The dreamer still in me 
Is in a total ingrain

Every time I tune up this thing
I'm reminded of what it feels like to break a string
And my hand reacts like a wounded woman
And nothing hurts worse...

// Real Love Baby //

Our hearts are free
So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
I'm a flower, you're my bee
It's much older than you and me
I'm in love, I'm alive
I belong to the stars and sky
Let's forget who we are for one night
We're not animals baby
It's the people who lie

I want real love baby
Ooh, don't leave me waiting
I've got real love baby
Wait until you taste me
I want real love baby
There's a world inside me
Got the preacher's music
Just if for a minute

Our hearts are free
So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
I'm a flower, you're my bee
It's much older than you and me
I'm in love, I'm alive
I belong to the stars and sky
Let's forget who we are for one night
We're not animals baby
It's the people who lie

I want real love baby
Ooh, don't leave me waiting
I've got real love baby
Wait until you taste me
I want real love baby
There's a world inside me
Got the preacher's music
Just if for a minute

I want real love baby
Ooh, don't leave me waiting
I've got real love baby
Wait until you taste me
I want real love baby
There's a world inside me
Got the preacher's music
Just if for a minute

Our hearts
(I want real love baby)
Are free
(Ooh, don't leave me waiting)
So tell me what's wrong with the feeling
(I've got real love baby, wait until you taste me)
I'm a flower, you're my bee
(I want real love baby, there's a world inside me)
It's much older than you and me
(Got the preacher's music, just if for a minute)
I'm in love, I'm alive
(I want real love baby, ooh don't leave me waiting)
I belong to the stars and sky
(I've got real love baby, wait until you taste me)
Let's forget who we are for one night
(I want real love baby, there's a world inside me)
We're not animals baby
(Got the preacher's music)
It's the people who lie
(Just if for a minute)

// This Atom Bomb And Me //

Ancient holy wars, dead religions, holocausts
New regimes, old ideas
That's now myth, that's now real
Original sin, genetic fate
Revolution, spinning plates
It's important to stay informed
So commentary to comment on
Oh and no one ever really knows you when life is brief
So I've heard but what's that got to do with this black hole and me

Age-old gender roles
Infotainment, capital
Golden bows and mercury
Bohemian nightmare, Dust Bowl chic
This documentary is lost on me
Satirical news, free energy
Mobile lifestyle, loveless sex
Independence, happiness
Oh and no one ever knows the real you when life is brief
So I've heard but what's that got to do with this atom bomb and me

Colosseum, families
The golden era of TV
Eunuch sluts, consumer slaves
A rose by any other name
Carbon footprint, incest dreams
Fuck the mother in the green
Planet cancer, sweet revenge
Isolation, all my friends
Oh and love is just an institution based on human frailty
But what's your paradise got to do with Adam and Eve
Maybe love is just an economy based on resource scarcity
But what I fail to see is what that's got to do with you and me

// This Is America //

It's less hard than it should be to find a dead guy dressed up as Batman
His penis out, with a magazine
And a Go-Gurt hanging out of his mouth but you know

We say "hey now, this is America"
We got some time to kill, and we need a thrill
So we die doing the dumbest of shit, here we go

We got people hanging out at abandoned malls
Trying to get the dead people to talk to 'em
With a little rigged up Bluetooth thing
With a feather kicking out of the back and you know

They got Go-Gurts, 'cause this is America
We got some time to kill, and we need a thrill
So we die doing the dumbest of shit, here we go

We got a guy going sixty on a six-foot unicycle
Gunning down a road that is made of gravel
And he's barreling towards a hanging bag
That is full of flaming Go-Gurts and now he is dead

I said, "Hey now, this is America"

// To R. //

I found you once, and I'll find you again
Your cells are ringin' bells, singin', "God is dead"
God is dead, God is dyin'
The poison's in the dose, true
And I've had just enough of my fill of my failure to possess you
And for the second time today
I repeat something only we would say

Now is it true you're goin' out of your head?
Riskin' perfection with somebody else
Oh, no more ridiculous than life itself

Buddy, what's wrong? Like the of angel death
Stopped by to ask about the extra room you rent
It's not like you, tell him to leave
Did you really have to ask him in? Sing him to sleep
And are you really so surprised
At just what a lost man's love looks like?

Now is it true you're goin' out of your head?
Riskin' perfection with somebody else
Oh, no more ridiculous than life itself
Life itself

// To S. //

Flyin' on past in your voodoo mask
High on your own supply
And the way that you hold my hand to the bone
Honestly ain't half bad

No
What about life on the ground
Makes you feel so strange
Without the blues you're tethered to
I'm sure you'd float away
"I had a dream and you were in it"
Is all you had to say

Guess what? I love you
Someone's gotta clean up the mess
There's parties to end in the kingdom of men
Someone's gonna need a new dress

No
What about life on the ground
Makes you feel so strange
Without the blues you're tethered to
I'm sure you'd float away
"I had a dream and you were in it"
Is all you had to say
Is all you had to say

// We Met At The Store //

We met in a parking lot
I was buying coffee and cigarettes
Firewood and bad wine long since gone

But I'm still drunk and hot wide awake
Breathing hard
And now in just one years time I've become jealous
Rail thin 
Prone to paranoia when I'm stoned

This isn't true love someone ought to put me in a home
Say do you wanna get married
And put an end to our endless aggressive tendency to scorn
Provincial concepts like your dowry and your daddy's farm

For love to find us of all people
I never thought it'd be so simple

Let's buy a plantation house and let the yard grow wild
Until we don't need the signs that say keep out
I've got some folk bucks left and it's cheaper in the south

I need someone I can trust
To protect me from our seven daughters when my body says enough
Don't let me die in a hospital
I'll save the big one for the last time we make love

Insert here
A sentiment regarding golden years
All cause I went to the store one day
I've seen you around
What's your name
