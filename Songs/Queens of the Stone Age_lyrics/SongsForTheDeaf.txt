Album: SongsForTheDeaf

// You Think I Ain't Worth A Dollar, But I Feel Like A Millionaire //

K-L-O-N Los Angeles, KLON Radio
We play the songs that sound more like everyone else than anyone else
KLON
Hey, alright, it's Kip Kasper
KLON Radio, LA's infinite repeat
How we feelin' out there?
How's your drive time commute?
I need a saga
What's the saga?
It's Songs for the Deaf
You can't even hear it

Dead bull with the life from the low
I'll be massive conquistador
Give me soul and show me the door
Metal heavy, soft at the core
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Pressurize, neutralize
Deep fried, gimme some more!

Space truckin', four on the floor
Fortified with the liquor store
This one's down, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more!

Shrunken head I love to adore
B-movie, gimme some gore
Gimme toro, gimme some more
B-movie, gimme some gore!

Uh!
Yow!
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more!

// No One Knows //

We get some rules to follow
That and this, these and those
No one knows
We get these pills to swallow
How they stick in your throat
Tastes like gold
Oh, what you do to me
No one knows

And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I
And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I

I journey through the desert
Of the mind with no hope
I follow
I drift along the ocean
Dead lifeboat in the sun
End come undone
Pleasantly caving in
I come undone

And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I
And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I

Heaven smiles above me
What a gift here below
But no one knows
A gift that you give to me
No one knows

Ustedes que son padres de familia

// First It Giveth //

I'm in you, now you're in me
I can't tell
You're so cruel, more than me
It is true (That's right)
Loyal to only you, up your sleeve
I want some (Come on, take it)
Of all of you (It's yours)
Trickin' me

First it giveth, then it taketh away
First it giveth, then it taketh away
First it giveth, then it taketh away
First it giveth, then it taketh away

I would beg and I would plead
I would shake

On a hook, dangling, wide awake
I'm so young
And beautiful (That's right, I'm slick)
I'm no fool
Time goes by, tables turn
All I know

First it giveth, then it taketh away
First it giveth, then it taketh away
First it giveth, then it taketh away
First it giveth, then it taketh away

First it giveth, then it taketh away
First it giveth, then it taketh away
Away, away

// A Song For The Dead //

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

It's late enough to go driving
And see what's mine
Life's the study of dying
How to do it right
You're a holy roller
If you bettin' to lose
If you're hanging around
I'm holding the noose

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Come a little bit closer
And get untied
In a hearse rolling over
Just a track in the line
Fuck it

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Come on, let's go driving
Come on, let's take a little ride
That's the study of dying
How to do it right

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

What?

// The Sky Is Fallin' //

The sky is falling
Human race that we run
Has left me crawling
Staring straight at the sun
Oh, in a moment I notice
Every dog has his day
I paid attention
Cost me so much to hate

For so long
I saw only wrong
But now to remind
It's a waste of time

Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling

I wanted something
Nothing blank I don't know
It's all deflecting
Stones are easy to throw
Oh, in a moment I've noticed
Hours, days left behind
Of wasted, useless
Selfless, none of a kind

For so long
I saw only wrong
But now to remind
Not to go back to the low

That has drained my life so low
That has drained my life so low
That has drained my life so low
That has drained my

Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling

Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling

// Hangin' Tree //

Would you like a way home?
I'll bleed my own

'Round the hangin' tree
Swayin' in the breeze
In the summer sun
As we two are one

// Go With The Flow //

She said, "I'll throw myself away
They're just photos after all"
I can't make you hang around
I can't wash you off my skin
Outside the frame is what we're leaving out
You won't remember anyway

I can go with the flow
Don't say it doesn't matter (With the flow)
Matter anymore
I can go with the flow (I can go)
Do you believe it in your head?

It's so safe to play along
Little soldiers in a row
Falling in and out of love
Something sweet to throw away
I want something good to die for
To make it beautiful to live
I want a new mistake
Lose is more than hesitate
Do you believe it in your head?

I can go with the flow
Don't say it doesn't matter (With the flow)
Matter anymore
I can go with the flow (I can go)
Do you believe it in your head?

Do you believe it in your head?
Do you believe it in your head?

// Gonna Leave You //

Wait by the phone
Late all alone
He can't help you
But I know I could

Three years too long
You know this is wrong
Everything scars the skin
Push it in, break it off

I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you (Oh)
I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you (Oh)

I gave it starts
I stomped on your hearts
This is the end
No more pictures, we ain't friends

It's raining in my room
There's blood in my spoon
You're outta my highchair
I'm outta your womb

I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you (Oh)
I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you (Oh)
I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you (Oh)
I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you (Oh)

Three years too long
You know this is wrong
Everything scars the skin
Push it in, push it in, break it off

I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you (Oh)
I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you (Oh)
I'm gonna leave
I'm gonna leave you (Oh)
I'm gonna leave, I don't need you (Oh)

// Do It Again //

Hey, hey, hey

I fall over and over and over
Over, over on you
I get ill, I get ill, I get ill
You're the only one I'm into

You and me fit so tight

I go lower and lower and lower
Lower, living easy
I don't know, I don't know
That I got till it's over

You and me fit so tight

Can you do it again?
Do it again? Do it again?
Can you do it again?
Hey, hey, hey

All the way, all the way, all the way
There's nowhere left we can meet (Oh)
I'm into what you do but I leave you nowhere

You and me (Hey) Fit so tight (Hey)
(Hey)
All we need (Hey) Is one more time (Hey)
(Hey)

Can you do it again?
Do it again? Do it again?
Can you do it again?
Do it again? Do it again?
Can you do it again?

I only get to live one life
Won't pretend you're only mine
Where will you go?
Where we all find the way

To do it again?
Do it again? Do it again?
Do it again? (Hey, Hey)
Do it again? (Hey, Hey)
Do it again? (Hey, Hey)

This is Tom Sherman, down here In Banning College, we're, uh We're promoting a blood dri-
Oh, shit

Welcome to the South of America, you're listening to AM580, lay back, sheep, little lamb, little lamb, little lamb

He told me so to my base
(Follow me and I will)
Good to know that he's walking with me
(Big rock is a weapon
The devil is a blast door)
And you have fallen into the love that needs to be designed by the Lord, Hallelujah, y'all, I wanna hear a couple 'ol Hallelujahs

// God Is In The Radio //

I thought I saw him on the video
A trance is keepin' him under
I know that God is in the radio
Ch-ch-ch-checking the station
The narcotic, from me to you
Just a call in the medium
I know you hear it, I hear it too
It's everywhere that I go

You come back another day
And do no wrong
You come back another day
And do no wrong
You come back another day
And do no wrong
You come back another day
And do no wrong

They say the devil is paranoid
Always tryin' to cover
But God is leaking through the stereo
Between the station to station
You believe it, I know you do
You won't admit it or say so
I know that God is in the radio
Just repeatin' a slogan

You come back another day
And do no wrong
You come back another day
And do no wrong
You come back another day
And do no wrong
You come back another day
And do no wrong

// Another Love Song //

You're so impossible
Scream and moan, it chills my soul
Don't want to hear you got left behind
All those times you stayed up and cried
It's no lie, you did it to yourself
Like chewed up gum under my shoe
Don't look surprised, you must've known all along

It's just another love song
Another love song

It's never easy, it's not hard
When you've lost your mind
With you it's sleazy
Don't tell me your worries
I'm sick, I'll leave you blind
Now the time has come
To leave this love that's left you dry
No need to work this out now
'Cause you know there's no reason why

It's just another love song
Another love song
Another love song
It's just another love song

I never told you it would last forever
You can't hold this boy for long, dig it
By the time you read my letter
Baby, I'll be gone

You're just another love song
Another love song
Another love song
You're just another love song
You're just another love song
Another love song
Another love song
You're just another love song

"This is W.O.M.B, the womb. And if you, my pets, learn to listen, I'll let you crawl back in. Here is something you should drop to your knees for, and worship. But you are too stupid to realize yourselves."

// A Song For The Deaf //

A song for the deaf, that is, for you

Nobody's coming down the hall
Nobody echoes in my head
Broken reflection, outta luck
Nobody ever needed it

I got what was
I want to take what's left
(Ready now)

Beautiful senses are gone
Canary in a gilded cage
Singin'
Sweet, soft and low
I will poison you all
Come closer, racin' to your tongue

I got what was
Want to take what's left
No talk will cure
What's lost, or save what's left
(For the deaf)

The blind can go get fucked
Lie beside the ditch
This halo 'round my neck
Has torn out every stitch

Who are you hiding? Is it safe for the deaf?
Beautiful cancer, infiltrate then forget
Yeah, I saw you coming and I heard not a thing
A mistake not to listen
When I knew where you'd been

And I got what was
I want to take what's left
No talk will cure
What's lost, or save what's left
(For the deaf)

You're listening to W.A.N.T, the high desert wonder valley favorite radio station. S'been a good night. Dave Catching here, not saying goodnight, just saying

Ha ha ha ha ha ha haaaa
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha haaa
Ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha, hah hah haaah
Ha ha ha ha ha

// Mosquito Song //

I know, I know the sun is hot
Mosquitoes come suck your blood
And leave you there all alone
Just skin and bone
When you walk among the trees
Listening to the leaves
The further I go, the less I know
The less I know

Where will you run?
Where will you hide?
Lullabies to paralyze

Fat and soft, pink and weak
Foot and thigh, tongue and cheek
You know I'm told they swallow you whole, skin and bone
Cutting boards and hanging hooks
Bloody knives, cooking books
Promising you won't feel a thing at all

Swallow and chew
Eat you alive
All of us food that hasn't died

And the knife says

Simmering, pick and pluck
Tenderize bone to dust
The sweetest grease, finest meat you'll ever taste
So you scream, whine, and yell
Supple sounds of dinner bells
We all will feed the worms and trees
So don't be shy

Swallow and chew
Eat you alive
All of us food that hasn't died

// Everybody's Gonna Be Happy //

Yeah, I know, I know
I know that everybody
I know that everybody be happy
Happy as you and me
'Cause I know, I know

Come on baby, let me tell you
All the things I wanna say
Come on baby, let me tell you
All the things I wanna say

Everybody gonna be happy
Which means you and me, my love
Everybody gonna be happy
Which means you and me, my love

And I know, I know, yeah
When I see you walking down the street
Well, it makes me happy to see you walking
Makes my life complete, yeah
'Cause I know, I know

Come on baby, let me tell you
All the things I wanna say
Come on baby, let me tell you
All the things I wanna say

Everybody gonna be happy
Which means you and me my love
Everybody gonna be happy
Which means you and me my love

And I know, I know
I know that you and me
I know that you and me be happy
Happy as we can be
'Cause I know, I know

Come on baby, let me tell you
All the things I wanna say
Come on baby, let me tell you
All the things I wanna say

Everybody gonna be happy
Which means you and me my love
Everybody gonna be happy
Which means you and me my love

Everybody gonna be happy
Which means you and me, my love
Everybody gonna be happy
Which means you and me, my love

// Bloody Hammer //

Demon is up in the attic to the left
My eye turns to the left to say, "No"
You said, "First, I am the special one"
I never hammered my mind out
I never have the bloody hammer
I never have the bloody hammer
I never have the bloody hammer
I never have the bloody
I never have the bloody
I never have the bloody hammer

I am the doctor
I am the psychiatrist
To make sure they don't think that they'd hammer their minds out
Or that they'd have a
I never have the bloody hammer
I never have the bloody hammer
I never have the bloody hammer
I never have the bloody
I never have the bloody
Or that they'd have a bloody hammer

Second, I am the special one
My eyes, green and blue
And safely unbegotten
To the left to say, "No"
While the others with their hair turned white
They just roll their eyes back to the top of their head
And hammer the attic floor with a bloody hammer
I never have the bloody hammer
I never have the bloody
I never have the bloody
I never have the bloody hammer

It's not a sledgehammer
It's not a chisel
It's not a train
But a thought of unlimited horror for Dr. O'Chane
Dr. O'Chane

The baby ghost says beat it with your chains
The baby ghost says don't drag your chain away, Dr. O'Chane

Doctor O'Chane, Doctor O'Chane
The baby ghost says, "Beat it with your chain"
The baby ghost says, "Drag your chain away, Doctor O'Chane"

The ghost says, "Beat it with your chains"
The ghost says, "Drag your chain away, Dr. O'Trey"

All bats are is Dracula vampires
Vampires in rain
Vampires in lightning for Dr. O'Chane
Dr. O'Chane

The baby ghost in the 1900's says, "Beat it with your chain"
The baby ghost says
"Don't drag your spoon, drag your chain away, Dr. O'Chane"

Demon is up in the attic to the left
My eye turns to the left to say, "No"
You said, "First, I am the special one"
I never hammer my mind out
I never have the bloody hammer
I never have the bloody hammer
I never have the bloody hammer
I never have the bloody
I never have the bloody
I never have the bloody hammer
