Album: Villains

// Feet Don't Fail Me //

Chasing, chasing
Dancing, on and on
Chasing, chasing
Dancing, on and on
Chasing, chasing
Dancing, on and on
Chasing, chasing
Dancing, on and on

I was born in the desert, May 17 in '73
When the needle hit the groove
I commence to moving
I was chasing what's calling me

Oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
One foot in the gutter
One in the clouds
Feet don't fail me now
I just gotta move on

Life is hard that's why no one survives
I'm much older than I thought I'd be
Feel like a fool, yeah, like a dancing fool, yeah
Footloose and fancy free

Oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
Stand in the gutter with my head in the clouds
Feet don't fail me now
I just gotta move on

Push myself, the breaking point
It's all I know to do except for lie
I chase brake lights and dust ad nauseam
Driven by feelings I cannot hide
To be so civilized, one must tell civil lies
On and on and on and on and

Me and my gang come to bust you loose
We move with an urgency
Between pleasure and agony, on a one-way line
That's the sound that's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's calling me
It's

Time to go, regret it later
We're gon' take it as it comes
Future tense meets middle finger
We take the long way home

Oh-oh-oh, feet don't fail me now
Do whatcha gotta do
Oh do it now
Feet don't fail me now
I just gotta move on

// The Way You Used To Do //

When I first met her she was seventeen
Seventeen
Jump like an arsonist to a perfect match
Burned alive

We run 'til no one could find us
Girl, we outrun everyone

But it doesn't matter now
Just come and love me how
Like the way you used to do
Yeah

Is love mental disease or lucky fever dream?
Fine with either
Gave birth to monsters who will terrorize normalcy, yeah
They'll terrorize

If the world exploded behind us
I never noticed if it done
Let nobody dare confine us
I'll bury anyone who does

But it doesn't matter now
Just come and love me how
Like the way you used to do

Now
The way you used to do

My heart, a ding-a-ling
A puppet on a string
C'est la vie
So lay your hands across my beating heart, love

If the world exploded behind us
I never noticed if it done
Let nobody dare confine us
I'll bury anyone who does

But it doesn't matter now
Just come and love me how
Like the way you used to do

Used to do
Like the way you used to do
Come and love me now
Like the way you used to do
Like the way you used to do

// Domesticated Animals //

Today is the day
Bewilderness comes to reclaim everything
Burning bridge lights up the sky
Zip your lip until you've picked a side

You get right up and sit back down
A revolution is one spin round
You get back up and sit right down
A revolution is one spin round

All for one, all for naught
Perish baby, perish the thought
Beat the kids to the punch
You've got heart, I'll have it for lunch

You get right up, sit back down
A revolution is one spin 'round
You get back up, sit right down
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, we all fall down

Tell me, where's the goddamn gold?
(Gold)

Pretty pets once were wild
Domesticated, love slave, give us a smile
You got a number, is it the same?
Who you belong to?
You feral or tame? (Probably tame)

Tell us where you keep the gold (Or what?)
We wanna help you rule the world (I think not)
We won't tell a single soul (So they all say)
So tell us, where's the goddamn gold?

I'll tell you where the gold is
It's in the ground
You wonder where's the reason?
It's in the lost and found

I'll tell you where the gold is
It's in the ground
You wonder where's the freedom?
In the lost and found
Still not found

I'll tell you where the gold is
It's all mine (mine)

Get right up, kneel and bow
Where's your revolution now?
Get back up, sit right down
Tears of gold, drink them down
Get right up, kneel and bow
Shrunken heads parade through town
Tears of gold, drink then drown
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, we all fall down

// Fortress //

Your heart is like a fortress
You keep your feelings locked away
Is it easier?
Does it make you feel safe?

You wander through the darkness
Of wilderness behind your eyes
I know you're afraid
But you gotta move on

Every fortress falls
It is not the end
It ain't if you fall
But how you rise that says
Who you really are
So get up and come through
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe

I believe I know you
Yet, I don't truly know myself
I pray you won't feel as alone as I have felt

I don't want to fail you so
I tell you the awful truth
Everyone faces darkness on their own
As I have done, so will you

Every fortress falls
It is not the end
It ain't if you fall
But how you rise that says
Who you really are
So get up and go through
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine

The Earth spins 'round the sun
And behold
Everything happens
Every night falls prey to sunrise

If your fortress is under siege
You can always run to me
If your fortress is under siege
You can always run

Every fortress falls
It is not the end
It ain't if you fall
But how you rise that says
Who you really are
So get up and go through
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine
Come on through
Come on through

// Head Like A Haunted House //

Your head's like a haunted house
A tutti frutti written over a caption
Misdiagnosis with-a the most-est
Cue the evil smile
Desperation can lead to madness
De-de-de-degradation is a must
The A-B-C's of leprosy
Need a hand? Take mine
We're subleem, sublime
Fake apologize
Fucks in short supply

Too late, too slick, too young
Gag the bag reflex, spoken tongues
Séance? Say what?
Say man, don't even think about it
Push the pesticide
Xanadus and xana-don'ts
Edumacate me, copulate me
A dirty trick and it's making me sick (Urgh!)
(You okay?) I'm fine
"Let's go" is my sign
We're subleem, sublime
G-g-g-goddamn crime

Tonight
I'm gonna put up a fight
I'm gonna get a reaction that I like
Burn the days
I reject your displays
I demand satisfaction or the knife
To trip the light fantastic, one takes wire on the shins
Petty disguises worn like skins, a distinction, nice
Drink the Kool-Aid and swallow the pill
You say that you don't and you won't, but you will
Busted

Your head's like a haunted house
Peepin' at your mumbo jumbo
Outta sight, go bump in the night
Screwacide
With posterior so superior
Ain't in a race for second place
Circumstances in my pantses
Cumming for action
Girl, I'll blow your mind
Then you will blow mine
We're subleem, sublime
Goin' for a ride

// Un-Reborn Again //

Skinny knows jack
Skinny knows jack
Knowing nothing about nothing
It's a blessing in fact

Acid-faced Jake
Acid-faced Jake
He like them dancing straight boys
It makes his pupils dilate

Juzzy come quick
Juzzy come quick
Tell the doctor to come over
Bring emergency kit

Evil ol' Scratch
Evil ol' Scratch
He drink the water from the gutter
It's a natural fact

Youth
You could be young again
Anew
Be un-reborn again
Askew

Frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally
Buried so close to the fountain of youth you can almost reach

Frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally
Buried so close to the fountain of youth you can almost reach

A fever

Chi Chi gone shake
Chi Chi gone shake
Ti rompo il culo
C'est magnifiqué óde lay

Twizzy gon' twitch
Twizzy gon' twitch
He said no huggy, no kissy
Until I get a wedding ring

K Dubs cuts quick
Taking no shit
Give a metal blow job
The middle finger n' split

Youth
You could be young again
Anew
Be un-reborn again
Right where the map ends, is where its hid
Under the X is where it lives
Askew

Frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally
Buried so close to the fountain of youth I can almost reach

Frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally
Buried so close to the fountain of youth I can almost reach

I had a vision as clear as day (Frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally)
Was delusions of grandeur in our DNA (Buried so close to the fountain of youth I can almost reach)
Every drop like an ocean, a moment of truth (Frozen in pose locked up in amber eternally)
Everybody was drowning in the fountain of youth (Buried so close to the fountain of youth I can almost reach)

Screaming, du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh
Screaming, du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh
Du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh-uhuh-uhai
Du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh

There's gotta be somewhere to bury the pain
Come drink from the water before it's been drained away
Every drop like an ocean, every moment undone
Implosions of beauty back to where we begun
There's gotta be somewhere to bury the proof
Everybody was drowning in the fountain of youth
Screaming, du-du, du-du, du-du la-di-duh
Screaming, mm-hm, mm-hm, hm-hm, hmmm-hmmm-hmmm

// Hideaway //

The kid who wants some of the pretties in life
Tried shortcuts those are myths
Despite
The first hands, the backhands, the bruises, the bites
The painful spoonful the hustle invites
Speak my name and I'll appear
Right here

Hideaway
Hideaway

I'm all dressed up, no one left to blow
Addiction to friction leaves you raw
Left with the taste of flesh and bone
It's a beautiful day in the USA
I requires a pupil, and I'm sure it's yours

Hideaway
Hideaway
You'll stay fast and lonely
Never ever need to run and hide from me
New prey, soft and easy, tangled forever in my arms
You'll feel love

Innocence is what you lose
Like keys and dreams and old tattoos
With one quick twist love turns to scar
Cruising the bruises in my car
Catch the keys, take the wheel and drive, for a while

Hideaway
Hideaway
You'll stay fast and lonely
Never ever need to run and hide from me
New prey, soft and easy, tangled forever in my arms
You owe me everything
You owe me everything

You'll feel love
You'll feel love
Hold my hand
You'll feel love
You'll feel love
You'll feel love
Who needs love?

// The Evil Has Landed //

Close
Come close

Going on a living spree
Any wanna come with me
You don't wanna miss your chance
Near life experience

Faces making noise
Say, "be good girls and boys"
It ain't half empty or full
You can break the glass, or drink it all
Dig it?

Close
Come close
Close
Come close

A grand macabaret
The last float on parade
As they sweep right up behind
Every puzzle peace of mind [piece of mine]
Handshake and facade
Play the fool or playing God
Just for God's sake play along
Or well, you can hum along
Hit it

Du-du-du-du-duah!
Dudududu-duuu-du-du
Du-du-du-du-duah!
Dudududu-duuu-du-du
Du-du-du-du-duuu

Diving, falling, no longer different
I fall beyond definitions now
Unless

Close
Come close
Close
Come close

Going on a living spree
You really wanna come with me
Ain't gonna miss the chance
Near life experience

We're all a little tangled
Corroded and mangled, yeah
But I'm for letting go
Yeah, I'm for letting go
Yeah, I'm for letting go
Yeah, I'm for letting go

Here.. we

.. come!
Here we come
Here we come
Here we come
Get outta' the way
Here we come
Get outta' the way
Matters not, what the people say
Matters not, what the people say
'Cause here we come
Here we come
Here we come
Get outta the way
Look out

// Villains Of Circumstance //

I miss you now, what's come over me?
We're hostages of geography
The wait is long and heavy too
Despite what you're accustomed to
I know that life moves on, that's what scares me so
Have no intentions of letting go
Only us, no one in the world
Only us, no one in the world

I better do something, move earth and sky
And patiently, sweetly, with all of my might
I sing only for you
To the beat of my footsteps in the night

Close your eyes and dream me home
Forever mine, I'll be forever yours
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore

There's no magic bullet, no cure for pain
What's done is done until you do it again
Life in pursuit of a nameless prey
I've been so close, I'm so far away
It's so hard to explain, so easy to feel
I need you now, nothing is real
Save me from the villains of circumstance
Before I lose my place

Close your eyes and dream me home
Forever mine, I'll be forever yours
I'll be forever yours
I'll be forever yours
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore
