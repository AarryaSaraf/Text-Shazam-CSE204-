Album: GardenOfLove

// Big Time //

Wanted to be on a stage
Where bright lights shine
On me at Carnegie
Polished up my act
Knew the crowds would see I had the knack
And that's a fact
Glamour and fame
Wasn't much more than a crazy game
I had to play
Now I got my wish
I don't know if I can handle this
But I think I'm gonna win
I'm in the Big Time, Big Time
And I know success is all mine, all mine
Big Time, Big Time
Gonna have the best of time
So now I'm there and an agent handles my career,
Star of the Year
Following the steps of the best
Of Broadway East and West,
I passed the test
It's all too much
With the interviews, reviews and such
I'm very touched
And it blows my mind
All the autographs I have to sign
And there's so little time
I'm in the Big Time, Big Time
And I know success is all mine, all mine
Big Time, Big Time
Gonna have the best of time
I was born to funk
I was born to funk and roll
In the Big Time

// Don't Give Up On Love //

When you turn your back on love
It's like turnin' off the light
You're in the dark and you're all alone
To deny yourself of feeling
It's like looking for a candle
In the dark of night when there's a storm
To enslave your inner feelings
Of your heart and soul and mind
Will cause you just pain
In a matter of time
And to lock in all emotion
'Cause your heart has just been broken
And expect your love to come
Then you're wasting your time
Give your love
Give me more than just a minute
Put your heart and body in it
And give me all your love
Give your love
Make it last forever
Tell me that you'll never leave me in a day
Don't give up on love
'Cause if you do, if you do,
Love might just give up on you and you'll find
That your life will be lonely, lonely
When you tell me love's a game
And you only play to win
And expect my heart to gamble
Then you're wrong again
When you love just to possess
Losing touch on tenderness
Then you call yourself a friend,
Then you just pretend
When you're makin' love to me at night
And something there just isn't right
When the lovemakin' is through,
I wanna talk to you
When we talk of love as the bottom line
Between two sheets when the love is fine
Then when out of bed
Can't relate from the head
Give your love
Give me more than just a minute
Put your heart and body in it
And give me all your love
Give your love
Make it last forever
Tell me that you'll never leave me in a day
Don't give up on love, no, no
If you do, if you do,
Love just might give up on you
Don't give up on love

// Island Lady //

My Lady of the Island
You kept me warm on tropic nights
Kept me smilin'
Your naked body lying on the sand
Lady of the Island
I'm your man
I love you and you know it
Like the waves that kiss the sand you somehow show it
Here on your island I would love to stay
Like a bird too soon I'll fly away
When I say I'm leaving you it breaks my heart
'Cause you know I wanna stay with you forever
Your love is fine, time after time
And I savor every sip and every swallow
Your brown-skinned body lying on the sand
Lady of the Islands I'm your man
Lady of the Islands understand
Leaving you breaks my heart

// Gettin' It On (In The Sunshine) //

Sunshine, bring on the sunshine
Sunshine, bring on the sunshine
Just gettin' it on just gettin' it on now
Just gettin' it on in the sunshine

// Summer Love //

Winter's gone
And like the seasons
I'm changing for reasons
I can feel your summer love comin' on
So warm and hot girl
I beg you don't stop
Could this be love that I'm going through
I can feel it
I can feel it
Could this be love
Summer love and you
Sitting in the park
Playing you love songs on my guitar
While the sun shines on your face like an angel
And with your eyes touching mine say it's time
This must be love that I'm goin' through
I can feel it, I can feel it
This must be love
Summer love and you
Could this be love I'm goin' through
Warm as the sun soft as the mornin' dew

// Mary-Go-Round //

Mary say she wanna just be happy
And she doesn't want to be let down
Make her smile and make her happy
And that's all you have to do to keep her 'round
I would take you Mary
Anywhere you want to go
On my private Lear jet
We could fly to Mexico
Lay 'round in the grass
Make love on the sand
You could be my lady
I could be your man
Mary get down, Mary-Go-Round, yeah
Mary-Go-Round and round and round and round
Mary-Go-Round, yeah
Mary say she doesn't wanna be lonely
I could never do that in a million years
I don't tease her, I just please her
And in that way I don't have to see her tears
Hey Mary, baby, let's go to Paris, France
And by the Champs Elysees we could make romance
Make love and dine and wine
We'd have a good time
Your wish is my command,
Girl, I'm your biggest fan
Mary get down
Mary-Go-Round, yeah
Mary-Go-Round and round and round and round
Mary-Go-Round, yeah
Mary wanna dance
And Mary wanna sing
Mary wanna love me and everything
Mary wanna dance and Mary wanna sing
Mary wanna make love and everything
Mary do you wanna roll around
Mary do you wanna roll around
Mary do you wanna roll around
Or do you just wanna get on down
She likes it up and down
She likes it in and out
Give it up for Funk
Just give it up for funk

// Gettin' It On (In The Sunshine) Reprise //

Give me my guitar

Alright now, just gettin' it on, in the sunshine
Everybody sing it out
Just gettin' it on, just gettin' it on now
Shine, I wanna sing
Just gettin' it on, feeling good at night, in the sunshine
Everybody sing it out
Just gettin' it on, just gettin' it on now
Save me a glass of that, please
Just gettin' it on, in the sunshine
Fire up that thing over there
Just gettin' it on, just gettin' it on now
Okay, that's all, give me a hit, okay?
