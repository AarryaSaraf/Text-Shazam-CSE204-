Album: UrbanRapsody

// Urban Rapsody //

Come on, come on, come on with the funk thang
Come on, come on, come on with the funk thang
Come on, come on, come on with the funk thang
Come on, come on, come on with the funk thang

Urban rapsody (Yeah)
Just the sound (Just the sound)
Sound of the ghetto

Even if you came through the party with some ass
Don't need no cash with the VIP pass
In your pocket or your purse, be my first verse
Raps an addiction such as Pulp Fiction
I represent the west, the number one, we be the best
No walking with no limping, no, I don't do no simpin'
Sticking to my player script suckas keep trippin' slippin'
Spread a lot of game, that's what the people want me

[?]
That you act that player hatin' copycat
Same little trip, you talk down on a player track
If you wonder how I got the boss game
Smokin' on Mary Jane, listenin' to Rick James
Uh, bring the funk (Bring the funk)

Urban rapsody (Yeah)
Just the sound (Just the sound)
Sound of the ghetto (What you say)

Urban rapsody (Yeah)
Yeah, just the sound

Eenie meenie miny moe, no matter what hood
That you come from, you get out if you just could
Pimps, players and pushers on the corner block
You should see all the money that you can clock
In the ghetto, you can hear a rapsody
And the melody is written just for you and me
Call it folk, call it rhythm and blues
It ain't nothin' but a feelin' that we choose

Urban rapsody (Yeah)
Just the sound (Just the sound)
Sound of the ghetto (What you say)

Urban rapsody (Yeah)
Yeah, just the sound (Just the sound)
Sound of the ghetto (Bring it 4-Tay)

Ain't no funk like funk this way in the bay
Where all the real players parlay
Stone City Band, 4-Tay and Rick James
Late night, clubbin', game recognizin' game
Toast the ass not the glass and we outie
All day, every day, players keep it cloudy
Mocha Almond, caramel, chocolate
One you got 'em started, man, it really ain't no stoppin'
Pimps, players, pushers, ain't nothin' like the ghetto
The party's on again, holler at a player, dough
Just like mafioso, so just bring a toast
Boss Hogs, shot callers and I'm the force
Passports for a scrapper it goes nation wide
And about that root of all evil it might just cost your life
Bring on the funk, Rick, we got the party pack
With all these freaks and hoes, man, I gots to mack

I can't stay 4-Tay
I got to go check out that West Coast thang

// West Coast Thing //

Wow... L.A. City of the angels. Palm trees, sunshine, honies everywhere

- Ooh girl, look! Ain't that Rick?
- Mm-hm! 

Yo girl!

Girl if you stop on by (right), my house for just a minute
We can lay by the poolside, sipping gin and juice
Throw some Mary Jane, and talk about our future
Together forever, me and you

Girl this LA town, is freaky and it's crazy
And you got to get down in order to come up
So girl let's kick this game around for just a minute
Together, we're in it to win it

In the summertime, we touch to the music
In the Hollywood nights, down on Sunset Strip
In the summertime, everybody's grooving
Girl, ain't nothin' but a west coast thing, y'all!

Woo!
Keep me rockin', keep me rockin' baby
All night long
Keep me rockin', keep me rockin' baby
West coast thing, yo

Girl if you're by sometime (right), we're drive down to the ocean
Grab some beer and some wine, and kick back on my yacht
You'll call your finest friends, and tell them to bounce over
And we'll sail to a spot nice and hot

California groovin', ain't nothin' but a party
You should see the freaks movin', down on Malibu beach
San Francisco Bay, down to San Diego
It ain't nothin' but a west coast thing, y'all!

In the summertime, we touch to the music
In the Hollywood nights, down on Sunset Strip
In the summertime, everybody's grooving
Yeah, it ain't nothin' but a west coast thing, y'all!

In the summertime, we touch to the music
In the Hollywood nights, down on Sunset Strip, yeah
In the summertime, everybody's grooving
It ain't nothin' but a west coast thing, y'all!

Here we go
Keep me rockin', keep me rockin' baby
All night long
Keep me rockin', keep me rockin' baby
West coast thing

Here we go
Ain't nothin' but a west coast thing
Ain't nothin' but a west coast groove
In the pool, in the pool

Yo, what's up?
Hollywood, yeah
LBC, and the San Francisco Bay
Give it up, y'all
In Old Town
Here in west coast thing, yo

Ain't nothin' but a west coast thing, a west coast thing...

// Somebody's Watching You //

"In today's headline news, the superfreak superstar is out of the slammer and back in the studio."
"From the WRAC news room, good news for the music world - King of Funk, Rick James, comes home after being released from Folsom Prison."
"This is Diane Jackson from KWET news. Making headlines, Rick James, funk superstar, was released today from Folsom."

Looking at the little piggies strutting in a row
Living in the shadows for a brother just to grow
Lying like a Devil, they stand waiting in a fire
Stuck inside a prison, walls of concrete and barbed wire
I never really ever thought I would make it out alive
They tried to keep me in a trick, so I would not survive
The Devil has a sneaky way of keeping a brother down
But now that I'm laughing in disgrace, I'm writing this one out

Somebody is watching
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching you, too
Somebody is watching
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching me, too
Yeah

To see there's really nothing, but a punk that's dressed in drag
(And you know that's right)
Their act is like a bunch of bitches, who are on the rag
(Yeah)
If anyone who's been there, can't relate to what I say
Now that I'm free, you see, I'm having it my way
(That's right)
So look at all the little piggies, standing in a row
Waiting in a shadows for a brother, just to glow
Lying like a Devil, they stand waiting in a fire
Stuck inside a prison, walls of concrete and barbed wire

Somebody is watching
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching me, too
Somebody is watching
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching me, too
Somebody is watching
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching me, too
Somebody is watching
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching me, too

Horns, blow!
This summer's funky!
Stone City Band, dig it up! Uh!
We gotta keep it funky, yea!
Everybody sing!

Somebody's watching you (somebody is watching you)
Somebody's watching me, too (somebody is watching)
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching me, too (might be the police)
Somebody's watching you (just might be the government)
Somebody's watching me, too (just might be a sucker)
Somebody's watching you (or might be a buster)
Somebody's watching me, too (or it might be your parole)
Somebody's watching you (somebody is watching you)
Somebody's watching me, too (somebody)
Somebody's watching you (somebody is watching you)
Somebody's watching me, too
Somebody's watching you (somebody is watching you)
Somebody's watching me, too (somebody is watching you!)

Crack cell 7!

Alright Superfreak, grab your shit.
You're on parole... we'll be watching you, boy.

// Back In You Again //

Glad to say that I really missed your sexy way
Here I am girl, back in you again
Since I've been gone, I thought about you everyday
Here I am, back in you again
[x2]

Back in you again
I'm back in you, baby...
Girl you never know how much I miss you, baby
...

Girl you don't know the trouble that I'm in
The stories long, so let me see where I'll begin
So baby please listen as I run this down
My life is on shaky ground, yeah
Something very funky happened just the other day
Busted by the man for just getting it my way
Girl don't you see, it's as strange as it can be
Now everybody's out to get me
I'm glad to say

Glad to say that I really missed your sexy way
Here I am girl, back in you again
Since I've been gone, I thought about you everyday
Here I am, back in you again

One minute I'm in jail, the next I'm on the run
Bullets are chasing me from gangstas and police guns
But all I do is think of you and our new child-to-be
And suddenly I'm free yeah
Funky situation but you must believe
I'm still the man that loves you, yeah
Girl you know me and you know I wouldn't hurt no one
So now you see I'm on the run, yeah
I'm glad to say...

Glad to say that I really missed your sexy way
Here I am girl, back in you again
Since I've been gone, I thought about you everyday
Here I am, back in you again

Back in you again
I'm back in you, baby
...
Girl it feels so good
To be back in you again
...
