Baby if you love me, come on girl and show me
Tell me what I must do
Got you where I want you, I love you girl it's only
Something I'm saying
Baby if you feel it, come on girl and meet

I've got all the treasures girl, that you've been missing
You need me to be your man
Baby, inspiration is something that you seek
In all that you say and do
The only limitation, is girl that I'm so weak
Whenever I look at you, yeah

// Free To Be Me //

I'm up, down, middle of my room
Someone got excited, someone dropped the spoon
A joke, a smoke, I'm crawling on my knees
I'm feeling paranoia, someone rock it, please

A place, a space, any box will do
Just don't let the sun in, please, until I'm through
A room, a tomb, with all those doctors there
Asking crazy questions, aren't they well aware?

I'm free to be me
I'm wild as a cat, busy as a bee
Free to be me
I do what I choose, I done paid my dues
I'm free to be me
Ask me why I dare, I'll say I don't care
I'm free to be me
Until the end of time, I'll say what's on my mind, baby

Day and night, there's always someone there
Watching like an angel, do angels really care?
I stand, I fall, just one day at a time
I keep my life together, but I can change my mind

I love, I lust, but even more I care
Sex is not a fashion, something that you wear
The truth, the lies, I hear them all the time
Coming from a stranger, a real good friend of mine

I'm free to be me
I'm wild as a cat, busy as a bee
Free to be me
I do what I choose, I done paid my dues

You can say what you feel
I paid dues to be for real
I can afford to wave my freak flag high

Free to be me
A funky millionaire, my God has placed me there
Free to be me
When I'm on the down, He brings me back around, baby

Free! Free! Free!
Sing it to me, baby-baby-baby-baby...
Free!

Free!...

// Save It For Me //

Saving all your wealth and money
Waiting for a rainy day
In the Land of Milk and Honey
It never really goes that way
What about your inspiration
You do it on your own free time
You're under investigation
But it's only in your mind (in your mind)

Ooh, save it for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, save it for me, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, save it for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, save it for me, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah

Met a lot of girls in Paris
I took them all to London Town
Then took a plane to New York City
'Cause there I know I could get down
Your girl was busy making movies
Somewhere down in old L.A.
She told me she could really love you
And boy that's when you ran away

You said ooh, save it for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, save it for me, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I said girl, save it for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You say ooh, save it for me, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

You said ooh, ooh, ooh...

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Save it for me, baby!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Save it for me please, girl
Save it all my love
Save it all my love, for you

Sing!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Sing!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah

// R U Experienced //

She was lonely, looking for someone
I was all that she thought I'd be
She was wanting something special
I thought it might as well be me

Come to my house, come to my room
We'll have dinner and I'll serve thee
Something sensual, deep in her eyes
Somehow I knew she wanted me, yeah

Are you experienced?
Whoa...
Are you experienced, sexually?

Are you?
Are you experienced?
Are you?
Are you?

She was watching, I was waiting
And we both knew, what was to come
Stop this waiting, anticipating
Let's relax girl, and have some fun

Come to my arms, come to my lips
Let me teach you with every move
Bodies swaying, fingers playing
It's so easy, just relax and groove, yeah

Are you experienced?
Whoa...
Are you experienced, sexually?

Are you?
Are you experienced?
Are you?
Are you?
Are you?
Are you?

Girl there's no doubt inside my mind
That if we spend a minute's time
I'll bring more feelings out of you
Than you have ever known
I don't boast or brag and this you know
I don't claim to be no Romeo or a Casanova Brown
But girl, I can throw down

Are you experienced?
Whoa...
Are you experienced, sexually?

Are you?
Are you experienced?
Are you?
Are you, sexu-
Are you?
Are you?
Are you?
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Are you?
Are you?
Are you?

Are you experienced?
Have you ever been... experienced?

// Funk In America / Silly Little Man //

[Funk In America]

Four, three, two, one...

Today, We the People of the United States of America
Are engaged in the invisible Third World War
It's only invisible, because we don't see or really wanna hear what's going on
The fact of the matter is, there are over 10,000 armed and ready
Nuclear missiles in the United States alone
Not counting other sites spread strategically across the globe
Ant it only takes a few hundred to guarantee total destruction
Funk in America

Between MX's, ICBM's, MIRV's and SLBM's and other missiles, there'll be no day after
And "All My Children" will not be televised today
Why? Because silly little men with power have all gone M.A.D.
M.A.D. meaning Mutually Assured Destruction for all of this
Funk in America

There'll be no NFL, no CIA, no neckties, or apartheids
No rayguns, no machine guns, no Weinbergers, no hamburgers
No Rambos or Gorbachevs to cheer or fear in this
Funk in America

And this sporting event will not be televised
So there'll be no scores in this rivalry of Democracy and Freedom
Against Communism and Totalitarianism
This game will only last minutes, and the playing field - the globe
And in the end, there are no winners at all
Funk in America

[Silly Little Man]

Did you read the news, oh boy
They dropped a bomb on the city
Blew the smile right off the child
Ain't that a shame and a pity (yeah)
Did you read the magazines
The president's under pressure
Russia won't cooperate
It's time to take other measures
Ooh-wee baby, baby

Can you really understand (can you really understand)
Such a silly man
Playing with your lives like toys (playing with your lives like toys)
Silly little boys
Can you really understand (can you really understand)
Such a silly man
Playing with your lives like toys (playing with your lives like toys)
Silly little boys

"Today, a top Air Force official told Congress, that a controversial MX missile has proved to be more accurate than expected"
"The Soviet Union is describing the first US test-lauch of an MX missile from an underground site as another case of group madness"
"Today, Russia keeps urging White House to stop supplying medium-range missiles to break world peace"

Do you know the game, oh boy
Two countries fight for survival
Neither one will win or lose
So here's a toast to the rival
What will all our children say
If there's no next generation
There won't be a place to play
When they drop the bombs on our nation
Ooh-wee baby, baby

Can you really understand (can you really understand)
Such a silly man
Playing with your lives like toys (playing with your lives like toys)
Silly little boys
Do you really understand (do you really understand)
Silly little men
Playing with your lives like toys (playing with your lives like toys)
Silly little boys

In case of a nuclear explosion
Place your head between your legs
And kiss your ass goodbye

They'll drop the bomb on you...
[Scat singing]
They'll drop the bomb on you...
[Scat singing]

"President Reagan met face-to-face with Soviet leader Gorbachev in Geneva, both sides challenging each other to stop the arms race"
"The Soviet news agency TASS says, Russia will take counter-action, if the U.S. continues to build MX missiles"
"President Reagan is trying to persuade Congress, to allow the Defense Departament to spend 1.5 billion dollars to produce 21 MX missiles"
"In Moscow, Soviet leader Gorbachev has announced, that new plan for peace is disarmament"
"U.S. officials told Congressional leaders, that if the United States did not go forward with the MX, we'd look like a weak puppy with European allies"

[Bomb dropping sound]

[Children singing nursery rhyme:]
London Bridge is falling down
Falling down, falling down
London Bridge is falling down
My fair lady...

// Slow And Easy (Interlude) //

It was a summer's day, when I first laid eyes on you
So small, pretty and petite, and oh, how you could sing
I remember the way you looked at me as you sat playing your piano
And the smiles of joy upon our faces, as we talked about our futures

Tears fill my heart everytime I hear you sing to me
And as time went on, you became such a star
The heavens were ignited and delighted by your brightness
And oh, how the people loved you and cheered your name

(Oh baby, oh baby...)

But all those times and all those lyrics between the lines
Became the very pain, that will someday separate us
I'll never forget, though the song lingers on
Of the love that's still strong, the memories of you
And I will always stay tuned in my heart tomorrow

So may your star continue to shine
And may you always remember that in my life
You are something called love

// Slow And Easy //

Darling, there are memories in my mind
I can remember so well
You were singing as I played my guitar
Love was in making in Portugal

There were feelings, I touched each part of you
And you surrendered all your charms
Love was blooming, and girl if you remember
I never felt that way before

Baby, you loved me in so many ways, baby
Slow and easy
You made love to me all night long
Slow and easy
Slow and easy

Darling, there are stories we could tell
About our feelings, and our love
And I realize, you know me oh, so well
Are you an angel from up above?

You were tender in our romance
And we sang it in a slow dance
And I knew you were mine
And the many tender pleasures
that no feelings could out-measure
Girl, so beautiful and fine

Yeah, you loved me in so many ways, baby
Slow and easy
I'll make love to you all night long
Slow and easy, oh yeah

Next time it'll be better, baby
Slow and easy
Slow and easy

I'll make love to you till it's almost dawn
Slow and easy
Slow and easy

Slow and easy
Nice and mellow
Slow and easy
Soft and gentle

Slow and easy
Soft and gentle
Baby you move me, yes you move me
Slow and easy...

// Painted Pictures //

Love is not a color
You can paint black or white, no, no
Picture that in your mind

Love is not a feeling
That you let go to at night, no, no
Picture that in your mind

You can play the game, you're so strong
You can say you're right when you're wrong
Still your life is just painted pictures

You can laugh when you want to cry
Say hello when you mean goodbye
Still your life is just painted pictures

Painted pictures, painted pictures
Painted pictures, painted pictures

Love is not a candle
That you turn on like a light, no, no
Picture that in your mind

Love is not a collar
You can call wrong or right, no, no
Picture that in your mind

You can give the things you don't have
You can lose the things that you love
Still your life is just painted pictures

You can play you're straight when you're not
You can say you're cold when you're hot
Still your life is just painted pictures

You can play you're good when you're bad
You can say you're glad when you're sad
Still your life is just painted pictures

You can lose when you want to win
You can die and be born again
Still your life is just painted pictures

Painted pictures, painted pictures
Painted pictures, painted pictures

You can play the game, you're so strong
You can say you're right when you're wrong
Still your life is just painted pictures

You can laugh when you want to cry
Say hello when you mean goodbye
Still your life is just painted pictures
