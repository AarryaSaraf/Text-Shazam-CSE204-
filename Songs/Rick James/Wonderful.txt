// Wonderful //

Ow!
Ow!
Ow!

I've got a story
I think you outta know
I missed you baby
I thought I'd tell you so

I've been so lonely, girl
Since you've been away
Now that you're back
All that I can say is

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful

I missed the kisses
All over you would place
The gentle touches
You lay upon my face

The sweet romancing
We make into the night
All your good loving
Would surely make it all right

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful

Here I am baby (here I am baby)
Standing right in front of you (standing right in front of you)
Telling everyone I see (telling everyone I see)
Your love is wonderful to me (your love is wonderful to me, baby)

Wonderful

I've got a secret
I think I outta share
I've had some lovers
But never really cared

I've waited for you
To come back to my world
This time forever
You'll never leave me girl

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful

To be united
Is all I want to do
I'm so delighted
Cause now I'm back with you

I've really missed you
I thought I'd tell you so
Your love was freshest
Your love is wonderful

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful

Here I am baby (here I am baby)
Standing right in front of you (standing right in front of you)
Telling everyone I see (telling everyone I see)
Your love is wonderful to me (your love is wonderful to me)

Here I am baby (here I am baby)
Standing right in front of you (standing right in front of you)
Telling everyone I see (telling everyone I see)
Your love is wonderful to me (your love is wonderful to me)

Your love is wonderful
Your love is wonderful
Your love is wonderful

Here I am baby (here I am baby)
Standing right in front of you (standing right in front of you)
Telling everyone I see (telling everyone I see)
Your love is wonderful to me (your love is wonderful to me)

// Judy //

I have known so many girls
In my time and space
Every color, every size
In the human race

When I first laid eyes on you
I was quite alone
Met you thru a friend of mine
Dinner at my home

Oh Judy, what am I to do
Judy, I'm still in love with you
Judy, you're so sweet and fine
Judy, always on my mind

Judy, you're a special girl
And this I understand
One day I will rock your world
Just let me be your man

If and when we meet again
I hope you're still the same
Until then girl, all I do
Is simply call your name

Oh Judy, what am I to do
Judy, I'm still in love with you
Judy, you're so sweet and fine, baby
Judy, always on my mind, baby
Judy, you're a part of me
Judy, girl you set me free, baby

Baby, baby, work
Judy, Judy
I still love you
Judy, Judy

// Loosey's Rap //

I know this chick, her name is Loosey
She's a freaky thang, yeah
He legs are long and her lips are juicy
You ought to hear what friends have to say about

Loosey's rap!
I said, Loosey's rap!
Loo-se-y's rap!

She don't scream and she don't holla
She don't make a sound, naw!
I have taught her like a scholar
She knows what to do
When my love comes down, I say

Loosey's rap!
I said, Loosey's rap!
Lotta, lotta, lotta, lotta
Loosey's rap!
Loo-se-y's rap!

They call me Loosey, 'cause I'm so loose
I make all the right moves, when I seduce
Your mind, your body, your soul, I will capture
Tell ya I'm so good that you will have to
Lose control, become infatuated
For something exotic, erotic and x-rated

Now the way I act and the words I speak
Make people think that I'm a super freak
Well I am what I am
And I does what I do
How would you like for me to freak you?!

// So Tight //

You got no money in your pockets
No shoes on your feet
Every place that you go
You can't afford to eat

Get a job, get a job
Get fired on the spot
Cause you don't think you can make it
You don't think that you're hot

Girls don't play when
They don't think they have time
Just to loosen up their bodies
Just relax their minds

So they game and they hustle
And trick into a bag
Ain't it sad you got to do it
Baby ain't it just a drag

So tight
Trying to make it on the streets
So tight
Trying to make ends meet
So tight
For the little boys and girls
Loosen up, loosen up
Party 'round the world, oh

Tight
Party 'round the world
Party 'round the world
Tight

Everybody wants to rap
All the suckers wanna sing
Cause they think it's all so easy
To do most anything

So you get yourself an agent
Put some gold around your neck
Then you strut in your Adidas
And say boy what the heck

All the money becomes
Easy cause now you're on the top
And as soon as you start blowin'
That's when the money stops

All the girls in the world
Are there at your command
They'll do anything you want
As long as they can understand

So tight
Trying to make it on the streets
So tight
Trying to make ends meet
So tight
For the little boys and girls
Loosen up, loosen up
And party 'round the world

So tight
Trying to make it on the streets
So tight
Trying to make ends meet
So tight
For the little boys and girls
Loosen up, loosen up
And party 'round the world, oh

Tight
Party 'round the world
Tight

What if all the people (what if all the people)
All around the world (all around the world)
All got together as one
There would be a party to remember, oh yeah

What if all the music (what if all the music)
All around the world (all around the world)
We all got together and sang
There would be some harmony forever, oh yeah

So tight
Trying to make it on the streets
So tight
Trying to make ends meet
So tight
Even the little boys and girls
Loosen up, loosen up
And party 'round the world, oh

Tight
Party 'round the world
That makes you
Tight
Party 'round the world
Tight
Party 'round the world, oh
That makes you
Tight
Party 'round the world

The time has come for me my darling, darling
To express the love for you I have inside my heart
And even as the sea makes its way to the shore

And in the sweetness of loving you I have found joy
So 'till life's end you will always be my lover and my friend

// In The Girl's Room //

- Girl am I tired. That gym class is really trying to kill me
- I know how you feel, my back's aching
- U want me to rub it for you?
- Would you?
- How's that?
- Mhm, that feels good...

I testify he was just a bit high
When he peeped in the hole in the doorway
He was amused, and the girls felt abused
What he saw would make you shake, shake

I wanna say it was his lucky day
All those girls in his eyes, just a-playin'
So why the trip, has the schoolmaster flipped
To expel him that's all I'm sayin'

Na na na na na naughty boy
Breakin' the rules in the girls' school
Na na na na na naughty boy
Playing around as he watched
The girls go down

In the girls' room
In the girls' room

I wanna know why does he have to go
Wouldn't you do the same in a minute
Can't I request, you put me to the test
All that he didn't do, was just get in it

Boys will be boys, no need to get annoyed
He was just having fun and got busted
Peeping in holes you will never control
There are some Peeping Toms that can't be trusted

Na na na na na naughty boy
Breakin' the rules in the girls' school
Na na na na na naughty boy
Playing around as he watched
The girls go down

In the girls' room
In the girls' room

He said she said someone heard a voice
Somebody is watching you
He looked into a hole
That's when he lost control, yeah
Somebody is watching you

He said she said someone saw his face
Somebody was watching you
In front of his two eyes
He got a freaky surprise, yeah

Ooh yeah
In the girls' room
In the girls' room
Hit me

// Hypnotize //

How could you leave me
Why did you have to say goodbye?
You should know better
Now all I do is sit and cry

How could you do it
After the changes we've been through
Look at me jonesin'
I'm still so much hung up on you

And everytime I see you
Undress me with your eyes
And everytime I touch you
I'm so hypnotized

Don't you understand I'm
Hypnotized by you
Hey baby, you got me hypnotized, yeah
And you put a spell on me
I'll never be free, no I'll never be free

What is this magic
What is this feeling you possess? (you possess)
Tell me your potion
A mixture of all your tenderness (tenderness, tenderness)

Was it your kisses
Or was it the way you held me tight? (so tight)
This strange obsession
Has you in my fantasy each night (oh baby)

And everytime I see you
Undress me with your eyes
And everytime I touch you
I'm so hypnotized

Don't you understand I'm
Hypnotized by you
Hey baby, you got me hypnotized, yeah

And everytime I see you
Undress me with your eyes
And everytime I touch you
I'm so hypnotized

Don't you understand I'm
Hypnotized by you
Hey baby, you're always on my mind

I think about you all the time, girl
Think about you all the time
I'll never be free, no I'll never be free

Hypnotized
Hypnotized by you, hypnotized
Hypnotized by you, I'm hypnotized, baby
Hypnotized by you, I'm hypnotized
Hypnotized by you
Hypnotized
Hypnotized
Hypnotized
Hypnotized

// Sherry Baby //

Sherry baby, I got lots of money
Sherry baby, you got lots of time
I'd take you to the land of milk and honey
But you never could make up your mind

Sherry baby

You're a woman with no point of view
Sherry, bless yourself with holy ointment
Cause the devil's chasing after you, yeah

He's after you, yeah he's after you

Oh, is that the reason you won't let me in
Oh, Sherry you need a man
Oh, you're not doin' the best you can

Sherry baby, relax

Don't you think it's time for you to share

And you're bound to find the answer waiting there

The answer's there, yeah the answer's there
Sherry baby, relax, take your time
Sherry baby

Oh, Sherry your girls best friend
Oh, is that the reason you won't let me in

// Hot Summer Nights //

[Rick James:]
Sometimes in winter, I'm coldest to you
Icy cold feelings are on my mind
Sometimes in winter, I sit by the fire
Frozen on snowflakes of my desire

[Chrissi Scinta:]
Don't worry baby
I'll be there, beside you
To warm you like hot summer nights

Don't worry darling
Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm here, by your side

[Rick James:]
Summer nights, baby
It's gonna be... (alright)
Summer nights, baby

Sometimes in winter, I'm cold to your teach
And my feelings are empty, and I don't know
Sometimes in winter, I tremble in fear
Thoughts of you leaving knock me here

[Chrissi Scinta:]
Don't worry baby
I'll be there beside you
To warm you like hot summer nights

Don't worry darling
Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm here, by your side

[Rick James:]
Don't worry baby
Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm here, by your side

Summer nights, baby
It's gonna be...
Summer nights, baby
It's gonna be...

Summer nights...
