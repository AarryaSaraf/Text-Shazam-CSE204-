// Hands Of Time //

When I rolled out of town on the unpaved road
I was fifty-seven dollars from being broke
Kissed my mama and my sisters and I said goodbye
And with my suitcase packed I wiped the tears from my eyes

Times they were tough growing up at home
My daddy lost the farm when I was two years old
Took a job at the prison working second shift
And that's the last time I let them take what should be his

Cause all I want to do is make a little cash
Cause I worked all the bad jobs busting my ass
I want to buy back the farm
And bring my mama home some wine
And turn back the clock on the cruel hands of time

When I hit the city I joined the band
Started singing in the bars and running with the men
But the men they brought me problems
And the drinking caused me grief
I thought I'd found a friend but I only found a thief

Soon I settled down with a married man
We had a couple babies, started living off the land
But my firstborn died and I cried out to God
Is there anybody out there looking down on me at all?

Cause all I want to do is make something last
But I can't see the future, I can't change the past
I want to buy back the farm
And bring my mama home some wine
Turn back the clock on the cruel hands of time

Still I keep a'running fast as I can
Trying to make something honest with my own two hands
And I ain't got the breath to say another bad word
So if I ever said it wrong won't you forget what you heard

Cause all I want to do is make my own path
Cause I know what I am, I know what I have
I want to buy back the farm
And bring my mama home some wine
Turn back the clock on the cruel hands of time

Cruel hands of time
Cruel hands of time
Cruel hands of time

// About To Find Out //

Well I've had about enough of your two-cent words
And the way you're running your mouth
No you haven't got a clue or another thing to do
Except to take another picture of yourself
You're living high on the hog looking down at us all
You may have come so easy and happened so fast
But the harder they come, they fall

You have many people fooled about your motivation
But I don't believe your lies
You blow so much smoke it's bound to make you choke
I see the snakes in both of your eyes
But you wouldn't know class if it bit you in the ass
And you're standing much too tall
You may have come so easy and happened so fast
But the harder they come, they fall

Tell me what does your pride taste like honey
Or haven't you tried it out?
It's better than the taste of a boot in your face
Without any shadow of a doubt
You better learn where the line is
You missed a lot you've gotta learn about
How's it gonna feel to be put in your place
Well I guess you're about to find out

Some folks today have got nothing to say
Except to talk about their wealth
But the poor's still poor and the war's still war
And everybody wants more for themselves
Like a rich man's child you never walked a mile
One day you won't have nothing to sell
You may have come so easy and happened so fast
But the way I see it you fell

Tell me what does your pride taste like honey
Or haven't you tried it out?
It's better than the taste of a boot in your face
Without any shadow of a doubt
You better learn where the line is
You missed a lot you've gotta learn about
How's it gonna feel to be put in your place
Well I guess you're about to find out

I said how's it gonna feel to be put in your place
Well I guess you're about to find out

// Tennessee Song //

Let's go back to Tennessee
You and me
Let's go back to Tennessee
Let's go back

Get off your chest what's on your mind
Pull the cork and pour the wine
Spill the beans, break the bread
The way you sing could wake the dead

I've been thinking about the road
Saddle up and let it roll
I don't know what suits you best
Sixty-five or Forty West

Without a doubt I may be wrong
But I've got a feeling going strong
In this world we won't be long

The future ain't what it used to be
Let's go back to Tennessee
Mountain high and valley low
Let's build down where the waters flow

Dig a well, pump the crank
Catch our dinner from the river bank
City life's a poison pill
Take me down where the wind is still

Take your time, baby, don't take long
Play another southern song
In this world we won't be long

Let's go back to Tennessee
You and me
Let's go back to Tennessee
Let's go back

Way back when the land was free
By nature and sovreignity
Lakota lived here long ago
Living off the buffalo
Seasons go, seasons come
Who we are and where we're from
The truth is clear to those who know
As above, so below

Take your time but don't take long
I've got a feeling going strong
In this world we won't be long

Let's go back to Tennessee
You and me
Let's go back to Tennessee
Let's go back

Let's go back to Tennessee
You and me
Let's go back to Tennessee
Let's go back

Let's go back

// Since You Put Me Down //

Since you put me down
I've been drinking just to drown
I've been lying through the cracks in my teeth
I've been waltzing with my sin
He's an ugly evil twin
He's a double-crossing, back-stabbing thief

I killed the angel on my shoulder with a fifth of Evan Williams
When I found out you were never coming home
I killed the angel on my shoulder
When you left me for another
I've been trying to turn this broken heart to stone

No darling, I won't speak your name
And I hope that you will do the same
But I hope my voice will haunt you above the ground
If I see your face again don't consider me a friend
You made me feel like an orphan and act like a clown

I killed the angel on my shoulder with a handle of tequila
So I wouldn't have to spend my nights alone, all alone
I killed the angel on my shoulder
Since you left me for another
I've been trying to turn this broken heart to stone

And all the vampires at the bar
They won't ever get too far
They're just sucking all of the good blood out of this town
But I'm an outcast, and I'm a stray
And I plan to stay that way
And even if I fall from my grace I'm gonna land back on the ground

I killed the angel on my shoulder with a bottle of the Bulleit
So I wouldn't have to hear him bitch and moan, moan, moan
I killed the angel on my shoulder
Since you left me for another
I've been trying to turn this broken heart to stone

I've been trying to turn this broken heart to stone

// Four Years Of Chances //

Well, I waited four long winters
Yes, I waited in the sun
I was crying all alone
While you were out having fun
I gave you four years of chances
But you threw em all away
I gave you one thousand, four hundred sixty-one days

I gave you four years of chances
To try to be your wife
I cleaned your shirts
And cooked up your supper
But you stayed out late at night
I gave you four years of chances
To try and fill a happy home
But now one more may as well be
A million and one

And now you know you lost me, darling
And you can't get me back
Ain't that just like a man
To change so fast
Because you want what you can't have
So now I'm going to say it slowly
Before I go away
You had me one thousand, four hundred sixty-one days

I gave you four years of chances
To try to be your wife
I cleaned your shirts
And cooked up your supper
But you stayed out late at night
I gave you four years of chances
To try and fill a happy home
But now one more may as well be
A million and one

I found myself a good man now
You know he treats me like he should
We live in a shack by a railroad track
He's out back chopping wood
We don't have have too much money
But I'll tell you why that's okay
He loves me every moment
Of them three hundred sixty-five days

I gave you four years of chances
To try to be be your wife
I cleaned your shirts
And washed up the dishes
But you never did treat me right
I gave you four years of chances
To try and build a happy home
But now one more may as well be
A million and one

But now one more may as well be a million and one

// This Town Gets Around //

In this town everybody's trying
To get a piece of everybody else
It gets hard to tell a real friend from a fake one
So many promises, favors, and lies
Most of the town wears a good disguise
And even I too, have been known to wear one

As the saying goes, it's not who you know
But it's who you blow that'll get you in the show
And if that's not the case I hear you pay 'em
But I don't come easy and I'm flat broke
So I guess it's me who gets the joke
Maybe I'd be smarter if I played dumb

I can't count all the times I've been had
Now I know much better than to let that make me mad
I don't let none of that get me down
From what I've found this town gets around

Now the very first manager I had
He was old enough he could have been my dad
He took me out for drinks and talked a big talk
He said, "darling sign on the dotted line"
You know, "kiss my cheek and drink this wine
But if you walk on me, then you can just walk."

I can't count all the times I've been had
Now I know much better than to let that make me mad
I don't let none of that get me down
From what I've found this town gets around

When I first came here the streets were paved with gold
And you can walk that road, I've been told
But I won't put out or be controlled
I don't write the shit that gets bought and sold
Ask any man
He might know
Who used to live on Music Row
But that was then, and this is now
He told me this town gets around
From what I've found this town gets around

// How The Mighty Have Fallen //

You thought you'd see
How green the grass it grew
On the other side
That divides me from you
You said I held you back
From bigger things
Now that you're running wild
You're running back to me

How the mighty have fallen
Like they do every time
And to me you come crawling
With your crown at your side
You were high on your mountain
Now it's back to the farm
How the mighty have fallen
Right back into my arms

I never meant to keep you
From being you
But I know that's an easier thing
To say than do
You brushed me off
And said I'd never grow
Now that you're on your knees
You're smaller than before

How the mighty have fallen
Like they do every time
And to me you come crawling
With your crown at your side
You were high on your mountain
Now it's back to the farm
How the mighty have fallen
Right back into my arms

How the mighty have fallen
Right back into my arms

// Weekender //

I went down to the county jail
And turned myself in
Spending all my weekends here
Far from my good-timing friends
Things just went from bad to worse
But I don't know when
The only thing I know for sure
Is I ain't going back again

They took me down to cellblock B
After stripping off my clothes
Put me in a monkey suit
And threw me in the throes
Like a rat in a maze
A cow in the herd
Or a sparrow with a broken wing
Now I know the reason why
The caged bird has to sing

Cause I'm just a weekender
In the Davidson County Jail
And my old man, he ain't got the cash
To even go my bail
Should have listened to my mama
And quit my life of sin
Before I went backsliding again

This bed is hard and the room is cold
And my cellmate's got a cough
She takes her meds and sleeps all day
Got six more weeks til she's off
She said she beat her boyfriend up
While high on crack cocaine
And now she sits and watches
Her life go down the drain

Cause she's just a weekender
In the Davidson County Jail
Her old man ain't got the cash
To even go her bail
She should have listened to her mama
And quit her life of sin
Before she went backsliding again

Walk into some other room
They tried to make me eat
Red-dyed gravy, cardboard bread
And something that looked like meat
One tough girl from cellblock C
Picked a fight with the man at the desk
Mighty soon was sent back to her room
And I bet you know the rest

Cause we're all just weekenders
In the Davidson County Jail
My old man ain't got the cash
To even call my bail
Should have listened to the good Lord
Maybe quit my life of sin
Before I went backsliding again
Before I went backsliding again

// Hurtin' (On The Bottle) //

I put a hurtin' on the bottle
Baby now I'm blind enough to see
I've been drinking whiskey like it's water
But that don't touch the pain you put on me

I was veering for the white line of the shoulder
Faded lights all cast upon the wall
Baby I know we've been getting older
But you're never too old to learn to crawl

I put a hurtin' on the bottle
Baby now I'm blind enough to see
I've been drinking whiskey like it's water
But that don't touch the pain you put on me

I met you with your thumb out in the alley
I know no one ever comes around here no more
Been looking for a peak inside the valley
Been searching for a key outside your door

I put a hurtin' on the bottle
Baby now I'm blind enough to see
I've been drinking whiskey like it's water
But that don't touch the pain you put on me

Been riding high on low expectations
It's like singing loud with no one left to hear
I've been drinking from the well of inspiration
But it's all falling on these wasted ears

I put a hurtin' on the bottle
Baby now I'm blind enough to see
I've been drinking whiskey like it's water
But that don't touch the pain you put on me

I put a hurtin' on the bottle
Baby now I'm blind enough to see
I've been drinking whiskey like it's water
But that don't touch the pain you put on me

Been drinking whiskey like it's water
But that don't touch the pain you put on me

// World's Greatest Loser //

I'm losing weight, I'm losing sleep
And all the things I just can't keep
I'm losing ground, I'm losing time
But if I lost you I'd lose my mind

I lost my way, I lost my youth
There's not much more I have to lose
I'm losing faith with all my strife
If I lost you I'd lose my life

There's not much here that means a thing
The house, the car, the diamond ring
And all of that, it seems so small
If I lost you I'd lose it all
