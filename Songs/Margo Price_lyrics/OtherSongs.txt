// Best Friends Make The Best Lovers //

It's a great big world with a million kinds of lovers
Rough, gentle, sloppy, and quick
You've got boyfriends, girlfriends, long-term whirlwinds
An ex that's a total prick
Some of them are cool, some of them are fools
And some are strangers in a bathroom stall
When it comes to pure pleasure, any kind of measure
There's one kind of lover that's the best of them all

Best friends make the best lovers
Banging with your buddy's the best
When you got love and affection underneath the covers
Baby, you'll forget the rest

So lovers might feed your primal need
But they'll leave you with a dull remorse
But when you're getting slutty with your number one buddy
It's the best of all worlds, it's a powerful force

Best friends make the best lovers
It's satisfaction to your core
'Cause when you love who you're loving you never want another
Baby, that's what friends are for
Best friends make the best lovers
Getting busy with your buddy's the best
When you add trust and affection to your carnal connection
Baby, you'll forget the rest
Baby, you'll forget the rest
Baby, you'll forget the rest

// Desperate And Depressed //

I'm pissed off at the number
Of people that I meet
Who go to shake my hand
With a viper up their sleeve
They freeze me out all winter
Burn me up all summer
Try to take my money
When I'm desperate and depressed
Ain't it a mess

I've played for free and paid for
The miles on my truck
Got no sleep in motels
Cause the worry keeps me up
It almost drives me crazy
Thinking about my baby
And how he's gonna love me
If I'm desperate and depressed
Can't get no rest

Momma never told me
That things would be this way
Daddy tried to warn me
That there'd be hell to pay
If I can't find the money
Then I can't buy the time
I'm stuck here making
Someone else's dime

We busked in Sarasota
I made twenty-seven bucks
I wept for Richard Manuel
Thinking I might have his luck
You talked behind my back
But only stabbed me in the front
But don't think you can hurt me
Cause I'm desperate and depressed
Ain't it a mess

Please, somebody tell me
How to make it stop
This world feels like a roller coaster
I just can't get off
Tried rehab and probation
Tried self-medication
But none of that can cure you
When you're desperate and depressed
Ain't it a mess

Momma never told me
That things would be this way
Daddy tried to warn me
That there'd be hell to pay
But if I can't find the money
Then I can't buy the lie
Oh, ten percent of nothing
Ain't a dime
So don't you try to sell me back what's mine
I'll be desperate and depressed until I die

// Fight To Make It //

You can't win on the very first try
You've got to learn to fall before you fly
They say a woman's place is in the home
Before she disappeared and she proved them wrong

You gotta fight (gotta fight) to make it (gotta fight)
You gotta fight (gotta fight) to make it (gotta fight)
You gotta fight (gotta fight) to make it (gotta fight)
Yes you do

For some it's hard to understand
What it's like to be born with a losing hand
How a dark skinned girl from poverty
Could change the world from a Bama bus seat

Yeah you gotta fight (gotta fight) to make it (gotta fight)
You gotta fight (gotta fight) to make it (gotta fight)
You gotta fight (gotta fight) to make it (gotta fight)
Yes you do

I remember sitting on my daddy's lap
I was four or five or something like that
And I'll never forget what he said to me
Honey, you can be anything you want to be

Yeah you've gotta fight (gotta fight) to make it (gotta fight)
You've gotta fight (gotta fight) to make it (gotta fight)
Yeah you've gotta fight (gotta fight) just to make it (gotta fight)
You've gotta fight fight fight just to make it

Yeah you've gotta fight (gotta fight) to make it (gotta fight)
You've gotta fight (gotta fight) just to make it (gotta fight)
Yeah you've gotta fight (gotta fight) just to make it
Yes you do, yes you do, yes you do, yes you do now

Oh, you do
You gotta fight
Oh yeah
You gotta fight to make it
You gotta fight

// Hands On The Wheel //

At a time when the world seems to be spinnin'
Hopelessly out of control
There's deceivers, and believers, and old in-betweeners
That seem to have no place to go

Well, it's the same old song, it's right and it's wrong
And living is just something that I do
And with no place to hide, I looked in your eyes
And I found myself in you

I looked to the stars
Tried all of the bars
And I've nearly gone up in smoke
Now my hand's on the wheel
I've something that's real
And I feel like I'm going home

And in the shade of an oak down by the river
Sat an old man and a boy
Setting sail, spinning tales and fishing for whales
With a lady they both enjoy

Well, it's the same damn tune
It's the man in the moon
It's the way that I feel about you
And with no place to hide
I looked in your eyes
And I found myself in you

And I looked to the stars
Tried all of the bars
And I've nearly gone up in smoke
Now my hand's on the wheel
I've something that's real
And I feel like I'm going home

// Help //

When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone and I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind, and opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, help me?

And now my life has changed in oh, so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
Every now and then I feel so insecure
I just know that I need you like I've never done before

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

Help...

When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
And now those days are gone and I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
Won't you please, please help me?
Won't you please, please...
Help me

Help...

// Leftovers //

I suppose
The whole town knows
You spend a lotta time on your knees
Like Blackfoot said:
You lie down with dogs
And you wake up with fleas
But you fell behind
Can't play in time
And you're rarely ever sober
So you're close for cash
Diggin' through my trash
For all of my leftovers
All of my leftovers

Like Yesterday's wine
You're past your prime
And you ain't no good for drinkin'
You can have your cake
Eat it too
But baby, that's just wishful thinkin'
So let me say it again
To your new friend
Who's been longing after clover
Like casserole
That asshole
Is all that's leftover
That's just leftovers

Wasn't much there to begin with
That's why I threw it away
You can have whatever's left
I didn't want it anyway
It was leftover, leftover

Hey hey, Honey
Ain't it funny
You're dressin' just like me?
But there's no imagination
In imitation
No that ain't flattery
I don't care
Wanna cut my hair
Change my name again
For to move away
From all those strays
That'll be the end
That'll be the end

Wasn't much there to begin with
That's why I threw it away
You can have whatever's left
I didn't want it anyway
It was leftover, leftover
Leftover, leftover

// Ragged Old Truck //

Early this mornin' without any warnin'
I took me a look at myself
I seen how this married up life I been livin'
Was tryin' to choke me to death
I laid on the bed with my gun to my head
And I nearly 'bout ended it all
But I come to myself just before I got killed
And I blowed me some holes in the wall

I'm thinkin' 'bout crankin' my ragged old truck up
And haulin' myself into town
I'm thinkin' 'bout raisin' so doggone much hell
'Til I'll die 'fore I live it all down
I lay 'round this place 'til I'm blue in the face
And I may as well be underground
I'm thinkin' 'bout crankin' my ragged old truck up
And haulin' myself into town

A honky tonk girl in a honky tonk band
With a honky tonk man on my arm
I may be as ugly as an old mud-rail fence
But I'm loaded with hillbilly charm
It's my plan and no man of mine's gonna tell me
I can't go and have me some fun
So before that old asshole comes back in from Waco
You can bet your rear end I'll be gone

I'm thinkin' 'bout crankin' my ragged old truck up
And haulin' myself into town
I'm thinkin' 'bout raisin' so doggone much hell
'Til I'll die 'fore I live it all down
I lay 'round this place 'til I'm blue in the face
And I may as well be underground
I'm thinkin' 'bout crankin' my ragged old truck up
And haulin' myself into town
I'm thinkin' 'bout crankin' my ragged old truck up
And haulin' myself into town

// Red Temple Prayer (Two-Headed Dog) //

Two-headed dogâ¦ two headed dog
I've been working in the Kremlin
With a two-headed dog

Two-headed dogâ¦ two headed dog
I've been working in the Kremlin
With a two-headed dog

Peace brought back fought back
Relaxed be nyet brought back
Did you dry her out
Wind her out like jerky?
To me sheâs healed to attack

Two-headed dogâ¦ two headed dog
I've been working in the Kremlin
With a two-headed dog

Two-headed dogâ¦ two headed dog
I've been working in the Kremlin
With a two-headed dog

Children nailed to the cross
Pain does not look our hell
Certainly is not a spell
Sweet waste from a well

Two-headed dogâ¦ two headed dog
I've been working in the Kremlin
With a two-headed dog

Two-headed dogâ¦ two headed dog
I've been working in the Kremlin
With a two-headed dog

Winds quiet in the night
Her body just blows Messiah
Sickening sweet sight left or right
Is all right does not please my appetite

Two-headed dogâ¦ two headed dog
I've been working in the Kremlin
With a two-headed dog

Two-headed dogâ¦ two headed dog
I've been working in the Kremlin
With a two-headed dog

Two-headed dogâ¦ two headed dog... two headed dog
I've been working in the Kremlin
With a two-headed dog

Two-headed dogâ¦ two headed dog... two headed dog
I've been working in the Kremlin
With a two-headed dog

Two-headed dogâ¦ two headed dog... two headed dog
I've been working in the Kremlin
With a two-headed dog

Two-headed dogâ¦ two headed dog... two headed dog

// Revelations //

I wrote Revelations on a crumbled up napkin
In an all-night diner by the roadway side
Waiter he was an angel kept filling up my coffee
And we made good conversation while I waited for my ride

Last night I played for a sold-out crowd down in Houston
Then we drove out to the ocean playing in the sand
These dark sunglasses I'm wearing this morning
Can't cover up my headache or the scars on my hands

Been healing the sick, blessing the poor
My feet are so tired and bruised
Hallelujah, what's it to you
Can't you see I need saving too?

My home life was unstable and it ain't much better now
I ain't no rotten apple but I ain't no sacred cow
Some people call you a genius some are saying not
Some folks only want you based on what you got

If you crucify glorify
They'll try to put a crown on you
Hallelujah, what's it to you
Can't you see I need saving too?

I never walked on water or turned it into wine
People make these stories up for something to believe
Now I'm living in a motel down on Highway 29
Nothing in my pockets and nothing up my sleeve

And if I never die this book that I write
I don't know who I'll send it to
Hallelujah, what's it to you?
Can't you see I need saving too
Hallelujah, what's it to you?
Can't you see I need saving too

// River //

It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm gonna make a lot of money
I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach myself to fly
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

He tried hard to help me
He put me at ease
He loved me so naughty
Made me weak in my knees
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
I've lost the best baby
That I ever had
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach myself to fly
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry
I made my baby cry

It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

// Shotgun Willie //

Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there

Can't make a record if you ain't got nothing to say
Can't make a record if you ain't got nothing to say
Can't play music if you ain't know what to play

Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there

John T. Floores was working for the Ku Klux Klan
Six foot five, John T. was a hell of a man
Made a lot of money selling sheets on the family plan

Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there

Shotgun Willie sits around in his underwear
Biting on a bullet and pulling out all of his hair
Shotgun Willie's got all of his family there

All right Margo!

// Sweet Revenge //

I got kicked off Noah's Ark
I turn my cheek to unkind remarks
There was two of everything, but one of me
And when the rains came tumbling down
I held my breath and I stood my ground
And I watched that ship go sailing out to sea

Take it back, take it back, oh no, you can't say that
All of my friends are not dead or in jail
Through rock and through stone, the black wind still moans
Sweet revenge, sweet revenge without fail

I caught an aisle seat on a plane
And drove an English teacher half insane
Making up jokes about bicycle spokes and red balloons
So I called up my local DJ
And he didn't have a lot to say
'Cause the radio has learned all of my favorite tunes

Take it back, take it back, oh no, you can't say that
All of my friends are not dead or in jail
Through rock and through stone, the black wind still moans
Sweet revenge, sweet revenge without fail

The white meat is on the run
And the dark meat is far too done
And the milkman left me a note yesterday
Get out of this town by noon
You're coming on way too soon

And besides that, we never liked you any way
Take it back, take it back, oh no, you can't say that
All of my friends are not dead or in jail
Through rock and through stone, the black wind still moans
Sweet revenge, sweet revenge without fail
Sweet revenge, sweet revenge will prevail without fail

// Worthless Gold //

Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold

When I was a child saw the good in every man
I didn't know there was blood on every hand
But I labored in my time and the truth be told
I sold my soul for worthless gold

Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold

Tried to walk that holy path but I strayed right from the start
Hanging out with all the angels heaven in the dark
I wrote those tunes and the bones down in the hole
But the only thing I stole was worthless gold

Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold

Now the way I battled with all the demons in my mind
Caught between good and evil, Lord it almost made me blind
Thought it was something tangible something I could hold
Now that I know all that I know
Is that I'd trade all this worthless gold

Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold
Worthless gold, worthless gold
