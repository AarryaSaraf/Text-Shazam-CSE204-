// Vitamin U //

Since you went away from me
I've got a love deficiency

Tried vitamin A, and you went away
Vitamin B to bring you back to me
Vitamin C for all the nights I cried
Vitamin D to dry my eyes
I tried them all and now I see
The only one that's gonna work for me
Is vitamin U, girl
To see me through, girl, oh, yeah

Thought if I could find another lover
With some tender care, baby, I'd soon recover, hey
But like useless remedies
They can't satisfy my needs

Tried vitamin A, and you went away, baby
Vitamin B to bring you back to me
Vitamin C for all the nights I cried
Vitamin D to dry my eyes
I tried them all and now I see
The only one that's gonna work for me
Is Vitamin U, girl
To see me though, girl, ooh...

You're my weakness
I need a does of you sweetness
Girl, my strength is fading
And my heart is ailing

Tried vitamin A, and you went away, baby
Vitamin B to bring you back to me
Vitamin C for all the nights I cried
Vitamin D to dry my eyes
I tried them all and now I see
The only one that's gonna work for me
Is Vitamin U, girl
I need some Vitamin U, girl
Some multivitamin U, girl
To see you through, girl
I need some multivitamin U, girl

Some multivitamin U, baby
(I need you to see me though, ooh...)
To see me through girl
I need some Vitamin U, girl
(I need you to see me though, ooh...)
To see me through girl
Multivitamin U, girl
(I need you to see me though, ooh...)
(I need you to see me though, ooh...)

Well, I tried Vitamin E, F and G
Vitamin H was no help for me
Vitamin I was hurting so
I tried Vitamin J, K, L, M, N and O
Vitamin P, Q, R, S, and T
Vitamin V, girl, and X, Y, Z
Only thing that they did for me
Was strengthen my eyes and help me see
I need Vitamin U, baby
I need some Vitamin U, baby

I need some Vitamin U, girl
To see me through, girl
I need some multivitamin U, girl
To see me through, girl...

// There Will Come A Day (I'm Gonna Happen To You) //

You may dismiss me as unimportant
A guy who's only in the corner of your eye
Right now I know I'm just a fleeting moment
I'm just an easy friend on whom you can depend

But darling, there will come a day, oh
When you look at me, my baby, another way
While you're relaxing, I'm gonna happen to you
Oooooh baby

I only see you in little glimpses
We work together in a world of nine to five
While I'm daydreamin' of champagne and kisses
You pass right by me, hardly know that I'm alive

But darling, there will come a day, oh
When you look at me, my baby, another way
While you're relaxing, I'm gonna happen to you
Oooooh

Oh baby, oh baby
Oooooh oh oh baby
Yeah

I only see you in little glimpses
We work together in a world of nine to five
While I'm daydreamin' of champagne and kisses
You pass right by me, hardly know that I'm alive

But darling, there will come a day, baby
When you look at me, my baby, another way
While you're relaxing, I'm gonna happen to you
To you, to you

There will come a great big day, yeah
When you look at me, my baby, another way
There will come a day, baby
Look at me, look at me

There will come a time, baby
When I'll be all yours, you'll be mine, baby
There...

// It's Been A Long Time (Since I Been In Love) //

It's been a long time since I been in love
Thought I forgot what to do
It's been a long time since I been in love
All it took was being with you

You are a simple and beautiful one
You taught me to love naturally
One look at you and I knew I was home
You gave myself back to me

Love how I feel, love how I feel
Love how I feel loving you

It's been a long time since I been in love
Wish I'd have known your address
It's been a long time since I been in love
Knowing you was called happiness, oh...

You are the sparkle that lights up my life
And makes everything seem so new
I'm all aglow with a halo of love
I know I'm shining for you

Love how I feel, love how I feel
Love how I feel loving you, oh...

It's been a long time since I been in love
Never thought I'd see the day
It's been a long time since I been in love
Now I know it's safe to say

I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, uh-huh

I love you, I love you, baby
(It's been a long time, it's been a long time)
I love you
(It's been a long time)
I love you, I love you, I love you

Nobody but you, I love you
(It's been a long time, it's been a long time)
I love you, baby
(It's been a long time since I been in love)
I love you, uh-huh, ooh...

I love you, I love you, baby
(It's been a long time, it's been a long time)
Really, really, really do
(It's been a long time since I been in love)
I love you, I love you

I love you, baby
(It's been a long time since I been in love)
I love you
(It's been a long time since I been in love)
Nobody but you
(It's been a long time since I been in love)
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you

// Let's Do The Dance Of Life Together //

Let's do the dance of life together, oh...
I love the way you move with me, oh...
You are a fascinating rhythm, oh, yeah
And your vibrations set my spirit free

I just wanted to see
You are someone very special to me
You're my destiny, baby
Just like two honeybees
We do the dance of life together
In sweet harmony

Let's make right now the best time ever, oh...
I never felt this way before
You are the magic in my motion, oh...
With every move you make, I love you more

I just wanted to see
You are someone very special to me
You're my destiny, woman
Just like two honeybees
We do the dance of life together
In sweet harmony

Touch my life
It's my life
Rejoice in the music
I am the music
Take me into your heart

Just like two honeybees
We dance in sweet harmony

Let's do the dance of life together, oh, baby
I love the way you move with me, yeah
You are a fascinating rhythm, oh...
Your vibrations set my spirit free

Let's make right now the best time ever, ooh, baby
I never, never felt this way before, yeah
You are the magic in my motion
With every move you make, I love you more

Let's do the dance together, together, together
I love, I love, I love the way you move with me, baby...

// If You Want My Love //

Anytime you're feeling lonely
And you need me, I'll be at home
Doesn't matter what I am doing
Call me up on the telephone
I'll pacify, try to take away every problem, baby, oh...
I'm sympathetic and you can cry on my shoulder, baby

If you want my love, I'll be around
Oh, yes, I will
If you want my love, I'll be around
You know I will

Don't you run when you've got someone
Who understands when you're not yourself
It's no fun, seems like just one tear
Can make the time when there's no one else
I might not have a PH degree in psychology, oh, baby
But I recognize what's behind your instantaneously
Instantaneously

If you want my love, I'll be around
Oh, yes, I will
If you need my love, I'll be around
You know I will

Baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
If you need me, I'll be around
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere
Oh, baby, oh...

If you want my love, I'll be around
Oh, yes, I will, baby
If you need my love, I'll be around
You know I will

Baby, anytime, anyplace, anywhere

If you want my love, I'll be around
Oh, yes, I will, baby
If you need my love, I'll be around
You know I will...

// You Cannot Laugh Alone //

Why did I have to see you again
I'm just getting you and me
It's too soon to be
Standing this close to you at a party
Laughing, pretending to be glad
Called a spade a spade
'Cause inside the joke
That you're telling
No one is laughing
Even you let me in on it
What's so funny?

You cannot laugh alone
That smile is not your own
Your love was crackerjack
A prize in every bag
A sugarcoated love
What dreams are made out of
A myth, a fantasy
A package C.O.D.
That no one will identify or pay for
A mystery left sitting on your front door

Throw it out of your mind
What you're thinking
Isn't worth wasting our time
What's the point in it?
Pretty eyes, softer tears
Strike a pose and push your hair
Back behind your ears
Sit up in your chair like a lady

You cannot laugh alone
That smile is not your own
Your love was crackerjack
It's a prize in every bag
A sugarcoated love
What dreams are made out of
A myth, a fantasy
A package C.O.D.

Your love was crackerjack
It's a prize
Your love was crackerjack
Your love was crackerjack
Oh, baby
'Cause your love was crackerjack

// In My Corner //

Winded, weak, lost, bewildered, hurt, all alone
Naked in the wind, tattered, and torn
I know a place where sadness grows small and scatters
Where the joy of love unfolding seems to fill the air

In my corner, love remains
In my corner, loves awaiting you
(Love is waiting for you to call on it, baby)
Loves awaiting you
(Love is waiting for you to call on it, baby)
You, baby

Gentle, and amused, delighted, satisfied
Comforted, and jealous, so highly prized
I know a place a broken heart can be reborn
Empty feelings live again, shattered dreams restored

In my corner, love remains
In my corner, loves awaiting you
(Love's waiting for you to call on it, baby
Love's awaiting for you)
Loves awaiting you
(Love's waiting for you to call on it, baby
Love's awaiting for you)
Love

Loyalty, security, patience, strength, and trust
Tenderness, and service, safety, and warmth
I know a place that holds these things close and dear
All the best of everything shining bright and clear

In my corner, there you are
In my corner, like a shining star
In my corner, love remains
In my corner, love's awaiting you

Love's awaiting you
(Love's waiting for you to call on it, baby
Love's awaiting for you)
Loves awaiting you
(Love's waiting for you to call on it, baby
Love's awaiting for you)
Loves awaiting you
(Love's waiting for you to call on it, baby
Love's awaiting for you)
Love
(Love's waiting for you to call on it, baby
Love's awaiting for you)
Tender love
(Love's waiting for you to call on it, baby
Love's awaiting for you)
Sweet delicate love
(Love's waiting for you to call on it, baby
Love's awaiting for you)

// The Humming Song (Lost For Words) //

You don't need words to sing along
'Cause this is just a humming song
I tried to write a verse for you
My mind was blank, no words came through

I searched for words to say just how I feel
Whenever you are near
You are the melody in harmony with me

Mmm-hmm-hmm...

Lost for words, all I feel is a melody, hey
Lost for words, all I feel is a melody

I hear a new song everyday
Inspired by the words you say
Your song of love plays on and on
Oh, our love is all in song

There are no words that can't express the joy
You brought into my life
You' re the melody in harmony with me

Mmm-hmm-hmm...
