// Hard Times //

I bought a house at the mouth of the holler
A ring at the pawn shop, and a crib for the kid
I heard some word there was work up in Hindman
I'm going tomorrow and hope that there is

My sweat and my wages they don't seem to weight out
I'm gettin' more aches than I'm gainin' in gold
Whoever said you could raise you a family
Just a'workin' your ass off knee deep in coal?

Well the sign at the church says I'll reap what I'm sowin'
But I ain't lost sleep, it'll come in due time
If the Lord wants to take me I'm here for the taking
'Cause hell's probably better than tryin' to get by

You can see me on the front page
It'll be out tomorrow
A boy in his 20's, shot down in his prime

For trying to hold up the Texaco station
They'll say I was desperate
They're probably right

I bought a house at the mouth of the holler
A ring at the pawn shop, and a crib for the kid
I heard some word there was work up in Hindman
I'm going tomorrow and hope that there is

// Junction City Queen //

Oh dance with me, junction city queen
Just to hold you would be the greatest thing
Just spinnin' around to the sound of the jukebox so low
And as the time fades, I pray that it goes by slow

Oh sing for me, junction city queen
Well you sound like an angel, so it seems
'Cause everything stops, as we pray you don't go
In the mornin' back to Ohio
But I find myself with empty arms
And a head thats full of dreams
Of my junction city queen

Won't you wait for me, junction city queen?
Well I'm headed that way, and I'm pickin' up steam
And I know for a while I'll be fine until I must leave
And wait for the next time that I see my queen

// We've Had Our Fun //

I need some money
I need it now
Give me a trunk load
And I'll show you how
We'll take that shinin' in no time
We'll be rollin' in the dough

But you don't take nothin'
Without gettin' bruised
See there's always somethin'
Your bound to lose
And it's usually gone
Before you know
When the man comes down
He won't cut us any slack
We've had our fun
On our own

You see all them blue lights?
They ain't your friends
They're bound to get you
But in the end
I'll show you all the tricky curves
And want you need to swerve around

But you don't take nothin'
Without gettin' bruised
See there's always somethin'
Your bound to lose
And it's usually gone
Before you know
When the man comes down
He won't cut us any slack
We've had our fun
On our own

When the man comes down
He won't cut us any slack
We've had our fun
On our own

// Coal //

Now God made coal for the men who sold their lives to West Van Lear
And you keep on diggin' 'til you get down there where it's darker than your darkest fears
And that woman in the kitchen she keeps on cookin' but she ain't had meat in years
Just live off bread, live off hope in a pool of a million tears

Now let me tell you somethin' 'bout the gospel
And make sure that you mark it down
When God spoke out "Let there be light"
He put the first of us in the ground
And we'll keep on diggin' 'til the comin' of the Lord
And Gabriel's trumpet sounds
'Cause if you ain't minin' for the company boy
There ain't much in this town

We could've made somethin' of ourselves out there if we'd listened to the folks that knew
That coal is gonna bury you

Now it's darker than a dungeon
And it's deeper than a well
So sometimes I imagine
That I'm gettin' pretty close to hell
And in my darkest hour
I cry out to the Lord
He says "Keep on minin' boy
'Cause that's why you were born"

Well we could've made somethin' of ourselves out there if we'd listened to the folks that knew
That coal is gonna bury you

// Good Thing Windin' Down //

Don't hold me
If you don't mean it
'Cause I'm tired of waistin' my time on things set on leavin'
Don't kiss me
If it really hurts you
Though I can't see how you could change after all that we've been through

I reckon it's time for a good thing to wind on down
But it kills me to see
That you don't give a damn about me
Oh I'd die for the chance we could be
Like we were when the summer was right
But you can't bring back days
Or nights that you've done danced away
I keep hopin' that maybe you'll stay
Don't leave me here lonely tonight

In my dreams
We're always laughin'
But I wake up to find that that very rarely happens
So go on and leave me
If it'd really please you
You'll be hard pressed to find you a man that will treat you like I do

But I reckon it's time for a good thing to wind on down
But it kills me to see
That you don't give a damn about me
Oh I'd die for the chance we could be
Like we were when the summer was right
But you can't bring back days
Or nights that you've done danced away
I keep hopin' that maybe you'll stay
Don't leave me here lonely tonight

// Play Me A Hank Song //

Well it all seemed so happy
But how can that be?
When there's a whole class of people
Just as lonesome as me

You asked me to tell you
How I can be so blue?
But you'd be the same
If the girl of your dreams
Broke your heart in two

So play me a Hank song
To ease my pain
Because it helps to know someone
Felt the same damn way

Alone and forsaken
Brother, what can I say?
I feel like a Hank song
Since she went away

Ol' KG's my buddy
We go way back
To the times back in high school
When I was too poor for Jack

But even he knows that sometimes
You can't help right the wrongs
By gettin' stoned blind
You need to sit down and pine
To a Hank Sr song

So play me a Hank song
To ease my pain
Because it helps to know someone
Felt the same damn way

Alone and forsaken
Brother what can I say?
You know I feel like a Hank song
Since she went away

Well I hope that she's happy
And I hope that she's free
I hope she finds her a man
To treat her like a queen

And then up out of nowhere
When she needs him around
She wakes up to find
She's ran out of time, and he's ran out of town

I hope she needs her a Hank song
To ease her pain
Because it'll help to know someone
Felt the same damn way

Alone and forsaken
Honey what can I say?
I hope you feel like a Hank song
One of these days

// If Whiskey Could Talk //

If whiskey could talk, it'd say I'm a great guy
Or at least it ought to, for as much as I buy
But it's money well spent just to help me feel free
From the pain she creates, when she's cheatin' on me

Well she's at it again, livin' high on the streets
So I reach for the bottle just to help me to sleep
And I lay here in bed and dream of a time
When she was content with being all mine

If whiskey could talk, it'd say I'm a great guy
Or at least it ought to, for as much as I buy
But it's money well spent just to help me feel free
From the pain she creates when she's cheatin' on me

She'll come back to me when the lights have gone down
And she's ran out of men to buy her a round
But she dreads comin' home to that drunk in her bed
Who's living alone hangin' on by a thread

If whiskey could talk, it'd say I'm a great guy
Or at least it ought to, for as much as I buy
But it's money well spent just to help me feel free
From the pain she creates when she's cheatin' on me

// The Harvest //

When the triggers moving backwards and the pin hits the shell
When my soul sinks slowly into the warm pits of hell
Won't you tell my baby sister that I'll be back in the fall
Cause it's better to have false hope than no hope at all

And I'll be meeting with my savior to go over my foolish deeds
When he asks me why I did it lord I'll blame it on the seed
Cause it didn't grow in like I planned and when it did it all went dry
And I couldn't stand to hear the pain of a small baby crying

Well I remember in the graveyards well I used to read the names
And I wondered when the good lord would take my soul away
Well I wonder if he planned it to happen like this at all
With the shot heard halfway cross the world and my sins on the wall

And I'll be meeting with my savior to go over my foolish deeds
When he asks me why I did it lord I'll blame it on the seed
Cause it didn't grow in like I planned and when it did it all went dry
And I couldn't stand to hear the pain of a small baby crying

And they'll tell me I'm a bad man but they never seen the sight
Of a baby wailing in it's crib and ripping apart the night
Is a small baby crying

// Detroit //

Readin' and writin' on Route 23
It's hard to believe we've made it this far
So come on boys and grab your coats
Detroit's waitin' so get in the car

Well the wind it blows cold but the girls are on fire
They say they're the prettiest things you have seen
And I ain't a gambler but I'd bet the farm
That Detroit's a gold mine waiting for me

The sidewalks are always jammed in this town
I feel like a dam that's about to cut loose
And the girls they say, will treat you fine
Beg for your silver 'til you can't refuse

And I'd love to go back to the hills where I was born
Instead of workin' on cars that I can't afford
My pockets are empty my patience is torn
Oh look what's become of me

Mama I'm writin' to tell you I'm fine
I'm workin' real hard and I pray every night
So don't you worry I'm happy and free
Detroit's been like a blessing to me

// The Gospel (According To Fishermen) //

I was raised in the house of a real holy roller warnin' people bout the ways of the sin
He said go out out yonder to the water and travel cause disciples they fishers and men
Yeah disciples they were fishers and men

So I got me a job on the first boat rowin' and it's been a mighty long time
Since I sat in the house of my father and my mother or I seen that woman of mine
Yeah that good lovin' gal of mine

I said babe I'm a'goin' on a little bitty journey I'll be back when the fishin' is through
While I'm away make haste to get ready for when Jesus comes for you
When the good lord comes for you
When Jesus comes for you, here it comes

Sayin' shall we gather by the water, the beautiful water
Shall we gather by the water that flows from the throne of god

Truth it lies in the love of a woman lord don't sink this boat
I got a pretty little thing waiting in New Orleans with a dagger buy her throat
And she don't wanna do it but she's that crazy and if I don't make it back
She'll probably die alone and cold as the Creole night turns black

Sayin' shall we gather by the water, the beautiful water
Shall we gather by the water that flows from the throne of god

Shall we gather by the water, the beautiful water
Shall we gather by the water that flows from the throne of god

// Silence //

Oh Rosie, Rosie my girl
When our embrace is over
All that's left is the world
It's a mighty cold town
To be wanderin' around
Without Rosie my girl

The floor is about to give way
To the weight of the words
You've been dyin' to say
We could save this house
If you'd just say 'em now
Oh Rosie my girl

Well silence is a mighty big grave
And whatever goes down there
Is as cold as the clay
Won't you keep me warm?
Tell me what I've done wrong
Oh Rosie my girl

// Long Hard Road //

Church bells ring at your window and I know that all of these things
Are surely found to be holy in the presence of the Lord
Tell me all that your feeling and I will believe every word
'Cause to think you would speak out in lies
Baby that just sounds absurd
And if you want me to go I will
But if you need me to stay baby that'd be a thrill

'Cause tomorrow will be a long, hard road out of Ohio and I'll hate every mile
That takes me back to Kentucky and away from your smile

Hold me and tell me you need me
I need you more than you know
'Cause now that I've found what I wanted it's hard to let it go
And the hills have always been home
But now that I've found you the shadows seem cold

And tomorrow will be a long, hard road out of Ohio and I'll hate every mile
That takes me back to Kentucky and away from your smile

And if you want me to go I will
But if you need me to stay baby that'd be a thrill
'Cause tomorrow will be a long, hard road out of Ohio and I'll hate every mile
That takes me back to Kentucky and away from your smile
