Album: CanITakeMyHoundsToHeaven

// Purgatory //

Will you pray for me
When the roots of the oak
And my ribcage are braidin'
If I can think
Lord knows that I will fondly pray for you
High on the hill where the fox horns blow
And down in the grave where they lay me low
Catholic girl, pray for me
You're my only hope for Heaven

When I's a boy
I'd drink and love and smoke and snort my fill
But all the while
I kept in mind the Lord's redeeming grace
High on the hill where the fox horns blow
And down in the city where the heathens go
Catholic girl, pray for me
You're my only hope for Heaven

Do you reckon he let's Free Will
Boys mope around in purgatory

I know that Hell
Is just as real as I am surely breathin'
But I've heard tale
Of a middle ground, I think will work for me
When the time has come for changin' worlds
I'll hedge my bets with a Catholic girl
Catholic girl, pray for me

// Old Country Church //

There's a place dear to me
Where I'm longing to be
With my friends at the Old Country Church
There with mother we went
And our Sundays were spent
With my friends at the Old Country Church

Precious years of memories
Oh, what joy they bring to me
How I long once more to be
With my friends at the Old Country Church

As a small country boy
How my heart beat with joy
When I knelt in the Old Country Church
And the Savior above
By His wonderful love
Saved my soul in the Old Country Church

Precious years of memories
Oh, what joy they bring to me 
How I long once more to be
With my friends at the Old Country Church

How I wish that today
All the people would pray 
As they prayed in the Old Country Church
If they'd only confess
Jesus surely would bless
As He did in the Old Country Church

Precious years of memories
Oh, what joy they bring to me
How I long once more to be
With my friends at the Old Country Church

Precious years of memories
Oh, what joy they bring to me
How I long once more to be
With my friends at the Old Country Church
With my friends at the Old Country Church

// Can I Take My Hounds To Heaven? //

You tell me there are streets of gold
And angels in the air
And while all that's fine and dandy
And I'm sure it's nice up there

There's just one thing that I need to know
Before I settle down
Can I take my hounds to Heaven?
Can I hunt on God's ground?

Now you say if I quit drinking
And try to toe the line
I can make it up to Glory
At the end of my life

And while whiskeys hard to throw away
It's somethin' I'd try to do
If I could spend forever
Runnin' hounds and treein' coons

But if I can't take my hounds to Heaven
If I can't hunt on God's land
I'd rather load my dog box up
And go to Hell with all my friends

I will wake up in the mornin'
And I will follow you to town
If I can take my hounds to Heaven
If I can hunt on God's ground

Now you say if I quit smokin'
And my rough and rowdy ways
We can hold hands forever
On streets of gold someday

But the only way I could stand it now
And I hate to say it's true
Is when you give me a hard time
I can do what I want to do

But if I can't take my hounds to Heaven
If I can't hunt on God's land
I'd rather load my dog box up
And go to Hell with all my friends

I will wake up in the mornin'
And I will follow you to town
If I can take my hounds to Heaven
If I can hunt on God's ground

If I can take my hounds to Heaven
If I can hunt on God's ground

// Way Of The Triune God //

Gimme that old time screamin' and a shoutin'
Go up tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubtin'
Way of the triune God

I don't need the pills you take
Just to feel the spirit movin'
Brother, I ain't slept in days
All without the drugs you're usin'

Fit me for the builder's use
Use me for the great commission
As it was and always will
As it is I'm here to witness

Old time screamin' and a shoutin'
Go up tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubtin'
Way of the triune God

I don't need the laws of man
T'tell me what I ought to do
He retched down and touched my hand
N'gave me quite a talkin' to

Gave it to me strict in charge
Somethin' simple I could ponder
Till the role is called on high
Till we all meet over yonder

Old time screamin' and a shoutin'
Go up tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubtin'
Way of the triune God

I don't need the pills you take
Just to feel the spirit movin'
Brother, I ain't slept in days
All without the drugs you're usin'
Fit me for the builder's use
Use me for the great commission
As it was and always will
As it is I'm here to witness

Jesus said he'd go before
And come back when the house was finished
All this sin and wagin' war
My God's comin' any minute

Old time screamin' and a shoutin'
Go up tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubtin'
Way of the triune God
Gimme that old time screamin' and a shoutin'
Go up tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubtin'
Way of the triune God
Way of the triune God
Way of the triune God

// Angel Band //

Hallelujah, jubilee
Hallelujah, jubilee

He stands behind the pulpit
He's calling out a line
Responds to congregation
Just a little way's behind
Echoes down the streets of gold
Through the Pearly Gates
Dribbles over the Jordan
And it goes on by the banks

He's rattling a Werther's
On his dentures in the pew
He's holding down the bass
It's a little out of tune
But his heart is in the hymnal
And that's all a boy can do
Make a joyful sound
Till the rest have come to roost

Hallelujah, jubilee
I can hear the angel band
I was blind but now I see
And I'll jump right in amongst them
When I reach the glory land

She's shouting in the aisle
She's shaking something fierce
Feels so good to be here
After all these faithful years
Just took a walk with Jesus
Just touched his nail-scarred hands
Didn't even bother her
That he ain't a blue-eyed man

Hallelujah, jubilee
I can hear the angel band
I was blind but now I see
And I'll jump right in amongst them
When I reach the glory land

There's Hindus, Jews, and Muslims
And Baptists of all kinds
Catholic girls and Amish boys
Who've left their plows behind
Up there in the choir
Singing side by side
Wondering why exactly
They been fussing the whole time

Hallelujah, jubilee
I can hear the angel band
I was blind but now I see
And I'll jump right in amongst them
When I reach the glory land

Hallelujah, jubilee
Hallelujah, jubilee
I can hear the angel band
Hallelujah

// Heart You've Been Tendin' //

All that you'll take
All that you'll take
All that you'll take
All that you'll take is the heart you've been tendin'

Ain't no way to fake it
No way around it
No time to tear it
And there ain't no excuse

And it ain't that hard
When you get down to it
Only tool that you'll need
Only one that you'll use

All that you'll take is the heart you've been tendin'
At the start or the endin' you'll be cast in the wild
You'll either go through like you know what you're doin'
Or run around aimless and scared like a child

All that you'll take
All that you'll take
All that you'll take
All that you'll take is the heart you've been tendin'

Now hearts they can wilt
When they're left in the window
Without any shade
From the sun beatin' down

And they ain't maintained and kept in water
But it's the only thing that you'll take to the ground

All that you'll take is the heart you've been tendin'
At the start or the endin' you'll be cast in the wild
You'll either go through like you know what you're doin'
Or run around aimless and scared like a child

All that you'll take
All that you'll take
All that you'll take
All that you'll take is the heart you've been tendin'

It'll show in your stride and the songs you been singin'
It'll give you some pride and then further along
When you've left it all
It can help someone else get back to their home

All that you'll take is the heart you've been tendin'
At the start or the endin' you'll be cast in the wild
You'll either go through like you know what you're doin'
Or run around aimless and scared like a child

All that you'll take
All that you'll take
All that you'll take
All that you'll take is the heart you've been tendin'
