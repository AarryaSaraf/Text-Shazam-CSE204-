// Queenzbridge Zoo //

Welcome to the Compton Zoo, ridin' on a chocolate moose
Camoflage Hummer gang, interior by Dr. Seuss
Gold dust, gold chain you knew I had to rock the noose
Just a nigga anyway, Emmett Till semi spray
But I pack a right hook only Robin Givens knew
Knock him out, paramedics had to use the Pikachu
Who invited sharks to the neighborhood swimming pool?
Sellin' streebo out of Deebo's pigeon coup-
Deville, "Ooh he I'll" is what the bitches say
That'll put your dick away, bullets tend to ricochet
Padlocks say Shawn Kemp had a flat top
Trynna sell this Richard Pryor autographed magic box
I might trade for a harpoon or a sasquatch
A two-tone do-rag or a Matlock DVD, flip hoes no TLC
Sell PCP to minors
Sherm by the boatload, perm from the soul glow
Closest that I ever been to church was the pollo
"No one ou there can fuck with me" Prodigy

I wrote this verse on my way to church
Rifle and the autographed Bible in the backseat
Life is like a track meet: When you hear them shots better run nigga
Cause I got that motherfucking gun nigga
Drug-dealer, crime rates run in the family
Juvenile felon so I'll never go the Grammy's
Who cares? Rather drive drunk bumpin' some Brandy
Going hard in the paint like I'm Olowokandi
Say, "Hi" to the big black forty when it click-clack
Push a nigga's wig back, pray for his family
Catch his mom slippin' turn him to Bambi
Prolly slam it like Camby, cocaine flow
Hoes propane blow, Peggy Hill
All my weapons kill come and test it nigga

By the way, mixtape December 30th... you're welcome

I'm that shit Frankie Lymon was stuffing up his arms
Firearms snuck in the luggage just for the fuck of it
I'm who would be runnin' shit if Jason took a day off
Cruisin' with that Tommy Gun, rip a nigga's face off
Vanilla Sky, got 'em high, Glock named Paula
Sit inside of my tinted ride I squeeze it she be moanin'
Kelly Slater trynna rock the top, sharks start swarmin'
Now you stuck in deep water with a smooth barracuda
Custom Bape, German Lugers levitate, meet your maker
Masturbate, let 'em mace ya
Bitch so she can grade in greatness, Sick cum
Guard-dog swag, but never bit none
Your bitch cunt, ask her where she got that shit from

// Barreta Scott King //

We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin at night man, it might get dangerous

I rap because I'm bored, and I'm bored because I hate everything
That I see day after day, out in L.A, I just stay
Because I'm scared that my life will be real once I leave
I hope God's gotta trick up his sleeve, just for me
If he there, or care about a nigga like that
Told the voices stuck in my head that I'll be right back
Can't get sidetracked, too much to lose
It's 1000 ways to die, way too many to choose from
The hardest part is wishin' for escape when you can't run
I'm unstable, not ready for when my fame come
So I prepare for the worst, I know them faggs will say
He snapped, but he snapped soon as his grandmother passed away

We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin at night man, it might get dangerous

But at the end of the night, I don't know you niggas
So I feel as if It's nothin' that I owe you niggas
That 4 pound Goku's niggas, leaves holes big as whole foods produce section
But if I empty a clip
I'll still be empty as shit
Fuck all that sympathy shit
Find where my empathy went
Just wish you would leave me alone
Then I start righting my wrongs
Probably stop writing these songs
Now all this pressure is on
Standing in the midst of the fire
Just turn my back on the world
Cus everybody's a liar
Guess its time for me to find my messiah
All my scriptures come as bullets
And the bible's in the form of a rifle
Just take one to the head
I don't gotta recite

We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin at night man, it might get dangerous

Champagne Wishlist, Bad Hoes
Smear that slipstick, Black Porsche
Gt with stick shift
Seat heaters, came with' bisquick
Break fast, stop a niggas lifeline
Speed off, leave him dead at the red-light
Tell them bitch ass niggas, get they bread right
Or get they lead right
Load up we out here erry night

Let me take you niggas back in the day
When some niggas from my city claim east side pain
It was like '08, sidekick '08s
That we here for
Filithyz made racks off robbery
Ain't a nigga livin' stoppin' me
Unless he poppin' me
Momma said I lost the God in me, My apology,
Live for takin' niggas property
Gangsta' hawk in me
Asking if the coppers follow me, Nigga probably
But I ain't never been scared of a lil' swine
Down to do a lil' time
Gimme space to clear my mind
Countin' up the sins of mine
Ran outta hands and feet
Holla' at me if you need the hands, I'll supply your need
I need the cheese, like a dope man needs the fiend
I don't believe anything' a nigga ever see
The only thing that scaring me, is a better me
So testin' me, you'll put your life in jeopardy

Champagne Wishlist, Bad Hoes
Smear that slipstick, Black Porsche
Gt with stick shift
Seat heaters, came with' bisquick
Break fast, stop a niggas lifeline
Speed off, leave him dead at the red-light
Tell them bitch ass niggas, get they bread right
Or get they lead right
Load up we out here erry night

I introduce to you America's disaster
Known as young black man with'out a master
Ain't signin' shit unless you givin niggas masters
The old men in space that I roam ima blast em
So try to play me and you kno' what's coming after
A hit em with them yam, like lebron on the gather
Never been a pacifist
Blame it on my pastor
When they tried to gimme ass to kiss
I gave them automatics
Makin' matters worse, every time I patch a verse
Blame the FBI for the unsuspected death of mine
Columbine, when it's chopper time
Chopper, chop her down, chopper style
Still a juvenile, but I'm runnin' wild

Doctors getting nervous
They running out of prescriptions
Mentally demented emotions are non-existent
Mother contemplating if this could've been prevented
Feeling like the blame for a child turnin' sadistic
Well, really?
You can blame it all on the Ridolin and Zoloft
That had me seeing Satan in my playpen
Family, I hate them
They prayers never did shit
Fuck is God supposed to understand
The pain he never had to deal with
Hell: he never been there
But forced me to live in
Don't ask me why I'm sinning
Cus I feel that nigga owe me one to tell the truth
Either be the victim or the first to shoot
Grab the Ruger and a clip or two
I want this ballad to be played at my funeral service
For a child, 17, whose brutally murdered
By himself, tortured for years
The one voice nobody ever wanted to hear
So, the ones inside of his head had to take control
God wouldn't take my soul, if that shit was free of charge
Satan neither, I need a breather from all this breathing
Grab a trigger and squeeze it

Illuminati watchin us, police poppin us
Waitin' until Christ come back so he can walk with us
Shells in the revolver, best hit somebodys mama up
Kev-lars over the heart to match the scarring of
Our pops not bein' here, took him for a couple years
Now my niggas stuck in here, so what we love it here
The drugs is here, the guns is here
Our mothers here, we run it here
The police lookin for me, they gotta come in here
A vicious cycle controlled, the pigs runnin the show
You think these guns just get dropped off at the door?
But I'mma still shoot, cause these days if you ain't gonna spray then
Somebody gonna kill you

Live for today cause tomorow never comes
Till I'm sittin' in the grave, I'll be sittin' in the slums
Cause I'm livin' just to die, ain't a ribbon in the sky
Just a nigga in the hood, buying time before it's gone

My grandmother said we outta asthma medication
But get ready for school, still, cause hell is waitin
If you don't learn shit, you won't be shit
And that would probably mean shit
If they tried and teach kids during the class
Gotta a heart made of gold, knuckles smothered in brass
The snakes lay where you play, so I stray from the grass
Mind already troubled enough
So don't confuse my cruel actions for givin' a fuck
I show no love, parents didn't give me enough
Its too late now, I barely even like bein' touched
My girl stopped givin' me hugs, says I don't see her that much
But I just prefer bein' alone, because...

Live for today cause tomorow never comes
Till I'm sittin' in the grave, I'll be sittin' in the slums
Cause I'm livin' just to die, ain't a ribbon in the sky
Just a nigga in the hood, buying time before it's gone

Live for today cause tomorow never comes
Till I'm sittin' in the grave, I'll be sittin' in the slums
Cause I'm livin' just to die, ain't a ribbon in the sky
Just a nigga in the hood, buying time before it's gone

I still remember when I saw ya
5 foot 5, maybe a little taller
Smile that reminds me of Christmas morning
When you first woke up and them gifts was opened
Yes sir, baby girl I'll
Got me feeling unreal like I popped that pill
Neo-Nazi, killer body
I think I love ya, prolly
But I don't even know ya
I tapped you on your shoulder, asked your name
You gladly told me, then you asked the same
I told you I was Vince
And you said you heard about me well I hope you didn't listen
Thought that I should mention, that you my perfect vision
Remind me of the middle school days when I couldn't wait to get to class
Just so I could fall asleep and dream about your pretty ass
So baby we can go far, but its up to you...

I see your pretty face, and I try to approach her
I know that we just met, but can we get closer?
What can I say, to make you stay, the night with me?
And girl it's up to you...

Yeah... look... first name crystal, last name amazing
Stars in my mind really got my heart racing
They say I shouldn't rush, that I should pace the situation
But these feelings in my head has got me feeling impatient
You could say this love thing has got my heart aching
Even if it's waiting, when she say that she is taken
All options open, so I keep my doors vacant
I know that she baking, off this shit I'm making
Thinking that it break in, hoping that it break out
Lights all on, you taking pictures with your face out
Full on platters where waiters bring the steaks out
But how can I leave, when there's no one else to take out
And I know it ain't my business...
But I just thought that I should mention...
That you know what I'm missing, so don't sit there
And try to act like you don't feel this...

I see your pretty face, and I try to approach her
I know that we just met, but can we get closer?
What can I say, to make you stay, the night with me?
And girl it's up to you...

Come summer time we was just relaxing
Swear that she was bad like the youngest of the Jackson's
The perfect imperfections, the first of my selection
Baby got drive, never asking for directions
She know she ain't my only, but she know just where the rest is
Young but never restless, she was losing lighter sleep
Cause she know when its said and done she gon' be right with me
Bonnie Clyde type shit, nice thighs, nice hips
Mind right, my type, my love, my life
My girl, my wife, couldn't say it better
Story board love, tell me who can play it better?
Shit gets stormy, we'll escape the weather
Her umbrella's up when them time's looking tough
Prolly wish we stop, but I can't get enough
So baby we can make this a forever thing
I'm talking 'bout, house, kids, cars, and wedding rings

I see your pretty face, and I try to approach her
I know that we just met, but can we get closer?
What can I say, to make you stay the night with me?
Well girl it's up to you...

Mr. International, I can probably times two
Everything you do in life and everything you might do
Probably stick my dick up in the bitch you say goodnight to
Niggas swear they beasting, I don't know who hyped you
Motherfucking lames, If I could I probably fight ya
Have my people light ya, you know just what them brothers do
Magic in the 32, LA Lakers run and shoot
Hit your mother, father, sister, daughter, and your cousin too
I'm the shit, hope you know, waving like row your boat
Sitting like southern poles drop the "e" add a "o"
That be my wardrobe, you malling with your mom
Rushing right before the store close, stack up a head case
Rare like a red steak, 90th and Hooper
Just to get the record set straight, homie we just set dates
Because I'mma get to popping once the L-beast start the drop
And you niggas start to flop and then you bitches get to copping

[LaVish:]
Uh, I'm in the carpool doing 150
With a dime piece out having lunch with me
My lifestyle now, boy it's something trippy
Rather hit the blunt 'cause I'm never getting tipsy
Yeah puffing on the green like an urban hippy
They repeat my name now like Timmy, Timmy
Timmy Timmy, T-Timmy Timmy, T-Timmy Timmy
Flying out boy genius, call me Jimmy
The first thing they speak about in any conversation
I'm going for the win, you're just the nomination
LaVish what they call me, and I'm often hated
I ain't the best yet, won't stop until the greatest
Yeah my bud is shining like a flashlight
And yeah we can collab for a flat price
And I'm rolling in a Polo, Marco
I bet they won't forget me, like Sarah Marshall
Dodger fitted on on the Ralph bucket
You a extra in this movie, yeah I'm out stunting
If you ain't talking money, then you ain't saying nothing
L-A-V signing out
I'm Chris Brown, run it

// Gold Chain Ricky //

I remember when I first saw "Fade to Black"
I told my grandma I'd get a chain just like that
She asked me was I trying to rap, not fucking with that
Just trying trap bricks, and stack chips
Cus that gold look good with a 'Lac tint
In the front seat sitting with a Mac-10
Just skating, Rory Fitzpatrick
Dope mathematics is all a nigga know
In it for the show, yeah the money and the hoes
All I ever want
Posted in the hood, shit I probably never go
Nigga run his mouth, then we throw him in the trunk
Bet his Mama never see him again, cus we in this to win
Not repented for sin, just replenish you ends
When it's time to fuck with Heaven, I'll just pay to get in
Spend the rest on a Benz, 5% on the tints

If I had all the money in the world, the money in the world
The clothes, the cars, the girls

Maserati Ricky, East side king with a semi
Pinstripe Dell Curry jersey's lighting 30's
Block hot so we stocking chickens in the churches
Sell em after service, bitch I service the community wales
Old dude said I'm going to hell, nah I'm going to well
Turn the castle into a crack house
Bitches with they back's out, trying bring they ass out
Hoping that the seed sprout, soon we'll check
See that fast life's cool till it all boils over
Bulletproof Rovers and two-faced chauffeurs
Won't save shit from a loud gun rip
When friends turn to foes on some come up shit
Most niggas die tryna live that life
But you never get to live that twice
So cock that, right?

If I had all the money in the world, the money in the world
The clothes, the cars, the girls

// Cassie Cut (Snippet) //

[Vince Staples:]
They all tell me I suck like Kurt Angle
Riot 'til that gun come out the hump
If you was smart you would duck
Duck goose with a slut, it's still two in the back
Still one in the front
My last gun in a month was a Remington Revolver
Fucking bummer how I didn't get to use it when I caught her
But anyway, I pulled the David Bowie out to skin her scalp
The sassy slut, just left half
And that's a motherfucking Cassie Cut

[Michael Uzowuru:]
That's all you get hahaha
That's all you fucking get
