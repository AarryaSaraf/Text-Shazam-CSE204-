Album: HeyManSmellMyFinger

// Martial Law //

Code: oh, how the funk linger
Emcees' access: smell my finger!

Aww woow, ladda ladda ledda ladda ladda
It's gonna take Martial Law, curfew ain't gonna get it
It's gonna take Martial Law, we're used to funking after hours
It's gonna take Martial Law, curfew ain't gonna get it
It's gonna take Martial Law, we're used to funking after hours
Yeah whores, nothing but a party

Check, funk is dead is what they said
While sitting around cheating at pool-smooth
Bags bagging and they weren't bragging to tell the truth
They were looking real cool
They were choked up tight in their white on white
Cocoa brown fronts were down
They wore candy striped ties hanging down to their flies
Sported gold dust crowns

It's gonna take Martial Law, curfew ain't gonna get it
It's gonna take Martial Law, we're used to funking after hours
It's gonna take Martial Law, curfew ain't gonna get it
It's gonna take Martial Law, we're used to funking after hours

Before I shrivel up and die
Let me tell you a little story about the FBI
The CIA, LAPD of the USA
Ask them why I list them, talking about that system
Let us take a look and see what's up today
They're taking away the rights from people, that's wrong
What did King say: "Can't we get along?"
Beat down by the man whose check he paid
Stacey Koons was just a drop, in the bucket full of wicked cops
No fire hose could wash that blood away

Ca-chase the cat! - Ca-chase the cat!
We're used to funking after hours
Ca-chase the cat! - Ca-chase the cat!

It's gonna take Martial Law, curfew ain't gonna get it
It's gonna take Martial Law, we're used to funking after hours
It's gonna take Martial Law, curfew ain't gonna get it
It's gonna take Martial Law, we're used to funking after hours

Taking the cue from the man in view
He followed him into out of sight
Where upon he paused or rather he stopped
Pressing the rewind then play on the beat box
The funk was a phoney, a fake and a fraud, bootleg copies to boot
Not funky with a P on it but funk with a three on it
Now comes the time to salute
He says here's to begging duplicating and bootlegging
Here's to the funk on which I'm high
The man made a pass, flashed a gold colored badge and said here's to I'm the FBI
Homeboy grinned as he said my friend
You want to make an example out of me
Cause I stole a little funk and I sold a little bunk funk
Some prevert rapes your daughter and goes free
The man said with a grin, that's not why you lose and I win
If you're going to steal the funk, steal the motherfucking P!

It's gonna take Martial Law, curfew ain't gonna get it
It's gonna take Martial Law, we're used to funking after hours
It's gonna take Martial Law, curfew ain't gonna get it
It's gonna take Martial Law, we're used to funking after hours

Martial Law!
Used to funking after hours, Martial Law
Martial Law!
Never missing a beat, yeah!
Martial Law!
Ladda ladda ledda ladda ladda
Whenever the party goes on, whatever it takes
Whenever the party goes on, whatever it takes
Whenever the party goes on, whatever it takes

// Paint The White House Black //

At these uptight times, hardcore funkateers before the bop gun
We unleash you a positive light. The bop gun can do you no harm
It frees yo mind, so yo' behind can follow
Let's Do A Fly-by

[Ice Cube:]
One, two, three and I come with the wicked
White house, lights out
Boom boom boom with the Bop Gun
Looks like I dropped one
I'm top gun, so picture...
(Picture this, paint a picture, picture perfect, paint a perfect picture)
Bill Clinton
(Picture this, paint a picture, picture perfect, paint a perfect picture)
[Phone beeping]
Here we go y'all

[George Clinton:]
Paint the White House black, brown

[Dr. Dre:]
Ha ha, yeah, what's up?
What's boppin'?
This is Dr. Dre callin' from Chronic Control
Could I speak to the president?
Aww, yeah, just tell him he was smokin' last night at the club
You know what I'm saying?
What? - he don't inhale?
Well I know, I got the wrong motherfuckin' house
Did somebody beep me from there?

[George Clinton:]
Colors don't clash, people just do
Color me happy next to you
Aww, just like it should, there goes the Neighborhood
That is what they'd have us believe

Paint the White House black, brown
Paint the White House...
[Sample of police sirens]
Paint the White House black, brown
Paint the White House, black...

Uhh, lookin' through a view of views
Seein' what they want you to
Blinded by the flames of friendly fire
And then they sat there like a dope
Until they choked from all that smoke
From behind a smoke screen of the patriotic liars

[Dr. Dre:]
Aiyyo, well check this out
If you talked to George Clinton
Tell him I'll catch him at the next plateau with the bomb
You know what I'm sayin?
It's not the pretendo but the endo
And I'll be droppin' some straight Chronic at his front door

[George Clinton with Ice Cube and Pupa Curley:]
Paint the White House black, brown
Paint the White House...
(Cause white ain't right, so get the flashlight)
Paint the White House black, brown
(No matter what creed, no matter what color)
Paint the White House...

[Flavor Flav:]
Now, check this out

[Chuck D:]
Yo yo Flavor man, we could kick like this
Yo, we could kick it man, yo, word up, man
Yo, check this out man
You know, the homeboys in Detroit, in Minneapolis, in L.A
In New York and down in D.C. man
They got the system in the back and boomin' it
But they don't know what we're sayin'
But the homeboys know what we're sayin'
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, check Yo-Yo

[Yo-Yo:]
If love ain't got nothin' to do with it then keep it
Ain't no big secret, we all know the reason
People change every day but life stays the same
One big game, ain't a damn thing changed
A woman's got to do what a woman's got to do
Be a mackstress, don't let these mackers mack you
So I get caught up in it, I'm stressin' and tired
The man who runs the joint gets me higher
It can be a White House, a black house
It can be a crack house, an outhouse
If it ain't the right house, go get your army gears baby
We got a fight, they ain't gonna set aside another night
[Sample of police sirens]
It's so bad that Los Angeles, is so scandalous
Give me somebody, who can handle us
Yo-Yo is on the top of things
So uhh... color me mad, I'm ready for a change

[MC Breed:]
I done came up short, one time too many
Yet a brother got to be comin' out his nickles
And countin' up his last pennies
Buyin' brushes and bum rushin' homey's greenery
Many envy but a hill of beans is what it means to me
Leave it up to me, I'm paintin' the White House black
There ain't no future in your frontin'
So why the hell you're frontin' jack?
It'll either change or we're gonna change it
"Yeah, it's gettin' old"
Usin' everything, from spray cans to charcoal
Put them up, then put the crew up on discharge
Leavin' wet paint signs in the front yard

[Flavor Flav:]
Yo George, these people crazy man
They don't even know what I'm sayin'

[George Clinton:]
Aww, airbrushed and colorized
Just changed right before our eyes, real as visualized
In every frame and let the love shine from the right house
Be in the black, red or white house
Through our fear the puppeteer can pull our strings
Whoah, well alright, again I say oh say can you see
The puppeteer pull the strings of you and me from the White House
The out house of territorial conquest
The HUD House, the pro-this, the anti-that
White against black, the right to life versus pro-choice

[KAM:]
I pledge allegiance to the flag
Being all I could never be... KAM READ HIS TOE TAG
Yeah, this is USA-K all day and you can't interrupt
Lay back, WATT'S UP
Stars and stripes for Tarzan types
Got brothers like me behind bars and on pipes
Damn, I'm gettin' took for a trip
They got me seein' stars from the club and stripes from the whip
Why must you all be like that?
I ain't into politics, so skip them white-collared tricks
They never did us no good
To hell with the space shuttle, put some money in the hood
And make jobs, let's mob up to the capitol
Then we ain't got to rap at all
Power To The People and the only way to get free
Is the J-to-the-U-S-T-I-C-E

[George Clinton with KAM:]
Picture this, paint a picture, picture perfect, paint a perfect picture
Y'all can't stop the bum rush, so get the paint brush
It's time for a change
Paint the White House black, brown

[Dr. Dre:]
Yo, listen to the real Clinton "WHO BILL CLINTON?"
Hell no, I'm talkin' about George Clinton

[George Clinton:]
Paint the White House black, brown

[Pupa Curley:]
All one blood, only a different color
And in a dis ya time, you have to help your neighbor
Look at the downtown area, no food to eat, no shelter
Them people have to live in a house made of paper
And when it rains it falls through like a sift wire
Hunger deh hunger, all over about time
All of us come together
Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, N.W.A, Flavor Flav, Chuck D
Public Enemy, Flea, Anthony stirrin' up the Chili
Yo-Yo, KAM and Breed, Prince and Pupa that's me

[Ice Cube:]
One, two, three and I come with the wicked
Boom boom boom with the Bop Gun, looks like I dropped one
You can get with this or you can get with it
Got to peel his cap, who's the mack?
Shit, I'll paint the White House black

[George Clinton & Pupa Curley:]
Picture this, paint a picture, picture perfect, paint a perfect picture
Picture this, paint a picture, picture perfect, paint a perfect picture
Picture this, paint a picture, picture perfect, paint a perfect picture
Picture this, paint a picture, picture perfect, paint a perfect picture
Paint the White House black, brown
(No matter what creed or what color)
Paint the White House...

Picture this, paint a picture, picture perfect, paint a perfect picture
Paint the White House black, brown

[Flavor Flav:]

Cause that's the way it be
Because his name George and his last name begins with a "C"

[George Clinton:]
Picture this, paint a picture, picture perfect, paint a perfect picture

[Ice Cube:]
Yeah, George Clinton, Nineteen ninety Tre
Droppin' on your punk ass motherfuckers and that's how we do it
You know what I'm sayin'? yeah

[George Clinton:]
Paint the White House black, brown
Those who oppose to be leveled up next to this
I ain't the devil, this ain't The Exorcist
Worse than a nightmare, you don't have to sleep on wink
The pain the mind gets everytime you think
Flashbacks, interfere, you start to hear
P-Funk in your ear

[Dr. Dre:]
Ha yeah, what's up?

// Dis Beat Disrupts //

Dis beat disrupts
Dis beat disrupts
Dis beat disrupts
Dis beat disrupts

This beat obstructs the justice of the peace
And the quiet in your neighborhood tonight
And not only that your feet scramble like a riot's goin' on
Back and forth and up and down and all across the floor
I never felt like this before, oh yeah, it was a housequake

Did you ever get the feeling that the walls were shakin'
The ceiling was loose out from under top of the roof
Shut up, already
The beat came out so downright courageous
It choppin' the melody like a machete
The beat just stomps the groove into a power housequake
O.K. the next thing I know I heard a bam followed by a boom
Party people steady jumpin' all around the room
The cops came soon, we discovered they came 2 party
We were stone cold quakin', honest to God almighty
Bam went the back beat
Boom went the alpine woofers
Back to back
Consecutively they bumped
It was hell from the captain if the party did jump

OK
So what you wanna know honey tell me about it
So what you got to say, and I might say yes
It might be good to go if you know one why doubt it
This is what you got comin'
Plenty of pumpin' humpin' pumpin' jumpin'
If it takes too long then you're doin' it wrong
Because it's positively easy on your feet cuz your jumpin'
The object is to keep to pick the groove, shut up
Hold that thought, better yet scrap it
The beat's cold chillin'
And derailing your train of thought dispatchin' it
The beats buried the groove and movin' it down to the ground
Damn

Dis beat disrupts
Dis beat disrupts
Dis beat disrupts
Dis beat disrupts

This beat obstructs the justice of the peace
And the quiet in your neighborhood tonight
And not only that your feet scramble like a riot's goin' on
Back and forth and up and down and all across the floor
I never felt like this before, oh yeah, it was a housequake
...

// Hollywood //

San Diego Freeway northbound around
Culver City, Westwood into Beverly Hills
You're gone Hollywood
I'm gonna look, I won't touch
Oh, it's live but then, thanks very much
Where the happening be at tonight, it's Hollywood
As I stepped out on my front porch
For miles around I see
Hollywood the way she once was, Hollywood the way she be
As I step back upon my back terrace
Amongst the pretty leaves on my lemon tree
San Fernando Valley way below

I'm strutting to the east side of "Hollywood!"
I'm stomping to the west side of "Hollywood!"
I'm stepping to the north side of "Hollywood!"
I'm strutting to the south side of "Hollywood!"

Holly wants to go to California, living in Hollywood!
Holly would if Holly could, living in Hollywood!
Holly she belongs in California, living in Hollywood!
Holly would if Holly could, living in Hollywood!

Say you want to be in the movie stars
Bourgeois, Intercontinental never know where you are
You've gone Hollywood
I was caught, out on the beat
Without even a single piece of ID
And the man said to me it's who you know in Hollywood
As I stepped out on my front porch
For miles around I see
Hollywood the way she once was, Hollywood the way she be
As I step back upon my back terrace
Amongst the pretty leaves on my lemon tree
San Fernando Valley way below

I'm stepping to the south side of "Hollywood!"
I'm funking on the north side of "Hollywood!"
I'm kicking on the east side of "Hollywood!"
I'm strutting to the west side of "Hollywood!"

Holly wants to go to California, living in Hollywood!
Holly would if Holly could, living in Hollywood!
Holly she belongs in California, living in Hollywood!
Holly would if Holly... living in Hollywood!
Holly wants to go to...
Ho ho ho ho... ha ha ha ha... ummm... mmmm...

San Diego Freeway northbound around

Hah hah hah hah... Hollywood!

// Rhythm & Rhyme //

[George Clinton:]
Therefore, this Rap rendition in tradition of competition
Mace the motherfucker before the first emission
Gets to ascend the mountain
I sip spout rhymin' ad infinitum
I pee in the fountain then I claw, clutchin' the cliff
Cause I got to get higher

[Shock G:]
I shall begin with a crazy evil grin
So evidently awesome both know somethin' will occur
Deep and dreadful be, constant careful
You get an earful of the fearful
The rhythm, the rhyme not based on material mind more so
Along strong ethereal lines although torn
From a brain remainin' to ruckus
You got music that is so massive you move to it
Or you must move away, choose to play or stray into it

[Money B:]
Over chill mode
I load a lyric fling you hard against the bass
In ways shown to be mixed from an ID a forbidden poet
In me, arrivin' unannounced and let me pounce on you
You bust, I'll bounce and it's a take out
You're through, finished quick, yeah, I said of that shit

[Shock G:]
And it takes just a few of my favorite breaks

[George Clinton:]
Rhythm and rhymes, rhythm and rhymes
I got rhythm and motherfuckin' rhymes
I got the rhythm and rhymes, rhythm and rhymes
I got the rhythm and motherfuckin' rhymes

[Humpty Hump:]
Therefore, this Rap rendition in tradition of competition
Mace the motherfucker before the first emission
Gets to ascend the mountain
I sip spout rhymin' ad infinitum
I pee in the fountain then I claw, clutchin' the cliff
Cause I got to get higher
Into the mansion where the mad messiah "G.C. gone crazy"
Hackin' in the channel, through all the slack rappers
I pack a bag, I travel to the peninsula with a posse
Peepin' over the edge, I drop a rock on your head
As you leapin' up the ledge, to lead on
Leavin' you mangled, tengled in your Mic cord
Your mamma would have been better in battle
Your boastin' is bogus
Silly poses is puttin' your pretty poetry packaged pathetically in front of me
I suppress, I arrest the best of MCs regularly
Come along, too strong, no don't move
This ain't a shake or bake, it's time to rhyme
For those who think we fake, a few of my favorite breaks

[George Clinton:]
Rhythm and rhyme, rhythm and rhyme
Rhythm and motherfuckin' rhymes
You walk a million miles to bite off one of my styles
Death tolls in the trillions, trashed by the trial of traumatic
Disorder sort of relatin' the way the I saw them
Death by battle before the post mortem
I caught them silhouetted, picked out to get it
Like an AK 47, I fired the rhythm
Let it reload my lips and gob to fit the job
Shootin' straight upon the head of a segregated slob
That hobbled up, bobbled up with a front to chap me
Get that bullshit out of my face
I totally rap my reply, attackin' every guy
Who from this point on now is doomed to die, for thousand times
As I rewind the very line I used to slay him with
Guess I was born with a gift, the dumb punk got me to deal with

And I got rhythm and rhyme, rhythm and rhyme
Rhythm and motherfuckin' rhymes
I got the rhythm and rhyme, rhythm and rhyme
Rhythm and motherfuckin' rhymes

Each growl is golden
I grow beholdin' to the bold but basic beat
That I been sold on loads of lyrics
Sewn attached desk to deck, mic'd and patched through disk
I snatched 2 thousand versions, I'm on a version excursion
Still I can spare a bit of time to do a rhyme without swearin'
Give him the all clear sign
And I'm preparin, darin, rap and roll with soul Compatibility
To the laughter at your rap senility
A line of rhymes snorted, my face is contorted
The loser says: I'm lame but he's self-supported
Yeah, it goes without sayin, it's true
Anybody gets fucked up, it's gonna be you
Yeah

And I'm your local gravedigger on a vocal hairpin trigger
As sure as candy's delicious, quicker than you figure
Too quick to quench the fire of my biggest funeral pyre
Builds and fills with fools desiring open combat
They choke and jump back, now they wonder how the fuck I've done that
Sensin' seconds too late, you got room for improvement
You wanna stop and drop, go over the top
You bop and strain your voice, ha ha, got no choice
Come back one more time and try to win against the veteran
The better than many, than plenty, than any
Fuck you! - here's the cemetery where they line up all the graves
Of those that tried that shit, no breaks
Pontious peers, lend me your ears
I'm the madman at the helm
The one that steers this vessel of vocals
Watch out, it's gettin' choppy
I ride the rough out in a way you connot copy
Look and see if the sharks have taken a bite out of my hull
They always do, and I feel the gale pull me into battle
Maybe I said somethin' really too clever
Right there off the top of my head, they take it and tape it
Before I can say this is the property of the "P"
Mine by design, each and every line, relies on the rewind
You better pray to the heaven and the earth
Cause I'm gonna scorch your monkey ass with the next verse

Rhythm and rhyme, rhythm and rhymes
Rhythm and motherfuckin' rhymes
Therefore, this Rap rendition in tradition of competition
Mace the motherfucker before the first emission
Gets to ascend the mountain
I sip spout rhymin' ad infinitum
I pee in the fountain then I claw, clutchin' the cliff
Cause I got to get higher
Into the mansion where the mad messiah
G.C. gone crazy, hackin' in the channel, through all the slack rappers
I pack a bag, I pack a bag
I travel to the peninsula with a posse
Peepin' over the edge, I drop a rock on your head

Fuck the dumb shit

// The Big Pump //

Come on! Awww!
Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump!
Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump!
Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump!
Baby, yeah

Pumping it with a big pump
Pumping, pumping, pumping it with a big pump
Pumping, pumping, pumping it with a big pump
Pumping, pumping, pumping it with a big pump "Yeah!"

You're my lover, yes, you are
Shining brighter than the brightest star
You turn me on so naturally
Your heavenly body only I can see
People are saying, baby, you're so smart
Picture your mind, it's a work of art
Feeling like a frog and I wanna jump
Got to do your body with the big pump

Pumping it with a big pump
Pumping, pumping, pumping it with a big pump "Pumping by the big pump"
Pumping, pumping, pumping it with a big pump
Pumping, pumping, pumping it with a big pump "Yeah!"

You've been shooting this crossbow
It's the chance to dance and fall in love, move your torso
Don't be afraid to shake that... (Shake that!) back
Move your rump to the pump track
Get your back up off the wall, get with the bass that pumps
Ya jumps cause you got to dig the stroke
It's no joke, cause the groove's all that
Move your body, baby, cause you know it's fat
In a club after hours
Doing the pump, is sure to move the wallflowers
You're up now, it's time to get down
If you got a bad foot, use the good foot like James Brown
Let the rhythm improve your step, swing your partner
And if you can't swing with that, it's all in the technique
But this beat's so fat, you look good with left feet
So feel the heartbeat with the bump
Cause you know, you dig the big pump

Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump!
Good God, you dig the big pump
Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump!
Good God, dig the big pump
Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump! Pump!
Good God, break it down

If it could make you dig this philosophy
Then I'd be doing better than the ones before me
I'm feeling like a frog and I need to jump
Talking about doing that body up
Talking about doing that body up
Talking about doing that body up with the big pump
With the big pump, good God!

Pumping it with a big pump
Pumping, pumping, pumping it with a big pump "Pumping by the big pump"
Pumping, pumping, pumping it with a big pump
Pumping, pumping, pumping it with a big pump "Yeah!"

Under a thick brick house Judy with a booty that's fat
And I'll show you how to skin the cat
Yeah, cause I'm digging the format
I ain't laying my game 'til I get you to the welcome mat
As we dance the horizontal
When I'm in the skins, baby, I'm hitting lotto
Cause I likes to humpty hump
I'm up for the down stroke with the big pump

Pumping it with a big pump
Pumping, pumping, pumping it with a big pump "Pumping by the big pump"
Pumping, pumping, pumping it with a big pump
Pumping, pumping, pumping it with a big pump "Yeah!"

// If True Love //

If true love is sacred
Mine is yours always forever
It pleases me to pray that
Home you'll come one day back to me
Each and everyday my... love for you grows stronger, baby
If true is sacred
Yours inspired love

You're so easy to love
Easy to love, you're so easy to love... your love
There lying still next to your lover not you early in the morning
Ohh... what a thrill to be lovers to you
Ain't no need to call it

If there's a cure for this here feeling in my heart
Please send it here as though your love were my doctor
Love diagnosed, it exposed, a broken heart
Although, I miss you so
Still adore, love so glad, you're always on my mind
Ooh... come to the dance, sporting a sweetheart or two
Make your baby jealous
Give me the chance, give me the chance
To play around on you, To play around on you
You're not the only fellow no
If there's a cure for this here feeling in my heart
Although, I miss you so
Still adore, love for you is always on my mind

If true love is sacred
If true love is sacred
Love, if true love is sacred

Love so glad, you're always on my mind
Love, umm, umm
Love make your baby jealous
There lying still next to my lovers
You're not the only fellow
Make your baby jealous, make your baby jealous
Love, ohh, what a thrill to be your lover
You're not the only fellow
To make your baby jealous

// High In My Hello //

Ain't a day go by that the cry of another mother
Increase the volume and sound, the volume and mass of tears
Drowning and drowning out the high in my hello, the sound is clear

Like anything greasy will have you slipping and sliding
Like anything sleazy will have you peeping and hiding
When I saw you at the party, I slid over to you right away
Aww, before fellows could slip a line in I had you out to my place

Only you can hear the high in my hello
You can hear the high in my hello
Only you can hear the high in my hello
You can hear the high in my hello

Oh bye, bye, bye, bye go bye
Every shot a scream another one dies
When I saw you at the party, I slid over to you right away
Before fellows could slip a line in I had you out to my place
Hey...

Only you can hear the high in my hello
You can hear the high in my hello
Only you can hear the high in my hello
You can hear the high in my hello

Do you promise the funk?
Promise to keep it, promise you'll keep the funk
Do you promise the funk?
Promise to keep it, promise you'll keep the funk
Huh, do you promise the funk?
Promise to keep it, promise you'll keep the funk
Do you promise the funk?
Promise to keep it, it's promise
Promise you'll keep the funk

Hey... I love you!
You can hear the high in my hello
You can hear the high in my hello "hello!"
You can hear the high in my hello
"I ain't no preacher or teacher, come on!"
You can hear the high in my hello "ooh hoo"
You can hear the high in my hello

Huh, wait a minute, aww, what's this I hear?
The funk is a fake, never let the icing
Get in the way of your cake
What's this I hear?
Y'all been faking the funk
That's way protects the pump, nobody's saking the rump

Vaseline victory
Vaseline victory
Vaseline victory

Only you can hear the high in my hello
You can hear the high in my hello
Only you can hear the high in my hello
You can hear the high in my hello

So it's said, that he who has the gold makes the rules
He who has the perspective, choose the news
Genocide in prime time, whose point of view?
All the news, and all the network, works against you
One perspective, for an entire media, is living as one
Who's the controller?
You can hear the high in my hello
He who has the perspective, choose the news
Genocide in prime time, whose point of view?
He who chooses the news, the network news to describe
Prime time genocide

Hello, hello!
Yeah, that's right
Only somebody, only somebody
Choose all the news, yeah, in one perspective!

Say something social; what I wouldn't eat if I wasn't on a diet?
Say something political; I'm dying to eat it

Where are the lumps in my gravy?
Where are the lumps in my gravy?
Where are the lumps in my gravy?
Where are the lumps in my gravy?
Where is the lumps in my funk?

A habit can be broken if you drop it
You say you try to kick it but you can't stop it
Biscuits good to the gravy when you sop
Like dripping from Joe you can't stop it
Poppa died of a headache
Cause he refused to be a cotton picker
Read this on a bumper sticker
And the gravy from greens is called pot liquor

Where are the lumps in my gravy? - just food for thought
Where are the lumps in my gravy? - and would you like to say girlies
Where are the lumps in my gravy? - enlightening baby, thanks for nothing
Where are the lumps in my gravy? - aww, let's eat
Where is the lumps in my funk?

I don't want to be a guru
Or claim to be a preacher or a teacher
Let me run something through to you
I feel for you, I hope I can reach you
Feel for you, I hope I can reach you
Feel for you, I hope I can reach you, yeah

Whoa, this is maximumisness
Bringing you organic truth
Food for thought
According to the genealogy of the "p" documents
The shepard has pulled the wool over your eyes
May I take your order

Where are the lumps in my gravy?
Where are the lumps in my gravy? - as it is so shall it be
Where are the lumps in my gravy? - if being is what it's about it is
Where are the lumps in my gravy? - maximumisness
Where is the lumps in my funk? - yo, ho!
Where are the lumps in my gravy?
Where are the lumps in my gravy? - yeah, food for thought
Where are the lumps in my gravy? - organic truth
Where are the lumps in my gravy? - speak on it
Where are the lumps in my gravy?
Where is the lumps in my funk?

This is the freedom of information, ha ha, getting funky
History, mystery, prophecies, new age world philosophies
Contemporary gossip has it that mother Hubbard has a funk
CIA I-O as in P2, illuminating funk P.U
Food for thought
Food for thought
The hearts and minds of men and nations
Food for thought
The great heresy, the non-believer, the infidel
Food for thought
And guess who's coming to dinner
Oh be quiet, what are you some kind of messiahship connection
Shut up, play Herbie
I am Sir Nose, D'Void of funk, I will never dance
I am the subliminal seducer
And the freedom of information is too expensive for you
I will never dance, I will never dance
You lie!

And the flag was still there, waving on while we dance
And the flag was still there, waving on as we dance
And the flag was still there, waving on while we dance
And the flag was still there...
Bum boom boom boom, bum bum bum
Bum boom boom boom, bum bum bum bum

I'm on hit
You're all over me like a shepard's sheep
It's deep, they only wanna talk about one thing me
I'm the Conversation about what it be
You give up each and every single possession to keep me
This be the reason me plus the things that I say
Yeah, I got it going on, women every night and day
Yes, yes, yes, is what they wish I'd say
But you know how it goes, they just stay stuck on me
I traded my limo' and a mansion for a yacht and a condo sure
I took little Susie to the movie
And she knew just what she had in store
I trade in men's women like credit cards
Any they just want to give me more
They trade a zero like you for hero like me
Yeah, totally and for sure

Yeah, cause I'm on hit
You're all over me like a shepard's sheep
It's deep, they only wanna talk about one thing me
I'm the Conversation about what it be
You give up each and every single possession to keep me
This be the reason me plus the things that I say

Ooh, the flag, ooh, the flag
Ooh, the flag, ooh, the flag
And the flag was still there, waving on while we dance
The flag is still here...
And the flag was still there, waving on while we dance
The flag is still here...

// Martial Law (Single Version) //

And the flag was still there
Waving on while we dance...

Boosting the bass volume to a deaf range
Crackin' a bottle of champagne
They exchanged lyrical gratifications verbalized in the form of a toast

It's gonna take Martial Law
Curfew ain't gonna get it
It's gonna take Martial Law
We're used to funkin' after hours...

Funk is dead is what they said
While sittin' 'round cheatin' at poolâsmooth
Bags baggin' and they weren't braggin'
To tell the truth, they were lookin' real cool
They were choked up tight in their white-on-white
Cocoa brown fronts were down
They wore candy-striped ties hangin' down to their flies
Sported gold dust crowns

It's gonna take Martial Law
Curfew ain't gonna get it
It's gonna take Martial Law
We're used to funkin' after hours...

Before I shrivel up and die
Let me tell you a little story 'bout the FBI
The CIA, LAPD of the USA
Ask 'em why I list 'em
Talkin' 'bout that system
Let us take a look and see what's up today
They're takin' away the rights from the people, that's wrong
What did King say, "Can't we get along?"
Beat down by the man whose check he paid
Stacey Koons was just a drop
In the bucket full of wicked cops
No fire hose could wash that blood away

It was the fifteenth frame of a straight pool game
And they all stood diggin' the play
With an idle shrug, they suddenly dug a strange cat movin' their way
He was a medium-built cat with a funny type hat
Looked about five years old
He wore a messed up vibe, he needed a shine
He shivered as if he was cold
Ah, but to all the other guys, they surmised
The dude was a motherfunkin' flunky
But the well-trained eyes of how the mothership flies
You could tell the sucker was funky
Homeboy grinned as the dude moved in
Askin' had they seen the doc
They said they hadn't seen him but heard he was fiendin'
He had went to the studio to cop
Ah, but if you got eyes coppin' size
I can cop the P, I'm in the flow
LP's, CD's, cassettes and 8-tracks
All good to go
But you got to post bail, my man's wholesale
He's the only connect I know
"Flash me some bread," the brother said
"Freeze here while I go score"
"Well I got the bread but I'm leary," he said
"I'm playin' with the big band you know"
Homey had plans to burn the man
To take his money and blow
But then he hesitated
Ah, cuz he had underestimated
Now he's got to do the real show (Ho!)
He said, "I can cop a piece on a small-time lease
You don't have to put up no ends
Find you a stump to fit your rump
I'll show back in ten"
Ah, but as the brother stepped off up crept another brother
"Yo, grab yourself a stick"
Said the little man, "I'm not a throw off, worse yet I'm a show-off"
As he chalked and broke the balls with his dick
Runnin' the three, the five, the seven, and twelve
Blood said "Yo mama" and the fifteen fell
With combinations of English and bankin'
He cued up to break rack three (Yo!)
Lookin' over his bridge past the ball to the figure near the wall
Strokin' his stick, sayin', "Hold my thing while I go P"

It's gonna take Martial Law
Curfew ain't gonna get it
It's gonna take Martial Law
We're used to funkin' after hours...

Taking the cue from the man in view
He followed him into out of sight
Whereupon he paused or rather he stopped
Pressin' the rewind then play on the beatbox
The funk was a phony, a fake, and a fraud
Bootleg copies to boot
Not funk with a P on it but funk with a 3 on it
Now comes the time to salute
He says, "Here's to beggin', duplicatin', and bootleggin'
Here's to the funk on which I'm high"
The man made a pass, flashed a gold-colored badge
And said, "Here's to I'm the FBI"
Homeboy grinned as he said, "My friend
You want to make an example out of me?
Cuz I stole a little funk and I sold a little bunk funk
Some pervert rapes your daughter and goes free"
The man said with a grin, "That's not why you lose and I win
If you're gonna steal the funk, steal the motherfunkin' P!"

It's gonna take Martial Law
Curfew ain't gonna get it
It's gonna take Martial Law
We're used to funkin' after hours...
