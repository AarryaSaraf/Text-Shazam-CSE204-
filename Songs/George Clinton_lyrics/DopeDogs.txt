// Some Next Shit //

Fight for your right to cuss, fuss, bust the rhyme
Yo, if that ain't enough
Fight for your right to cuss, fuss, bust the rhyme
Yo, if that ain't enough
Fight for your right to cuss, fuss, bust the rhyme
Yo, if that ain't enough

Yo, no loudspeakers, but I'm speaking loud
Vehnacular ass kickin' truth out to the crowd!

The tick was clockin' the tock
Dockin' every muthafuckin'
Hickory dickory mice runnin' up the clock
Shit hits you in your gut
In your poot butt

I can't hear you!
I don't hear you
I still can't hear you
Of course it's gang related, there's a gang of us on the stage
Damn right it's drug related, this shit is dope
Your turn
Funk-ya My lordy (oh lordy)
No matter how derogatory, auditory
Oh lordy A P-Funk
Oh Miss Smarty-Ain't nothin' but a party

So hickory dickory dock
Tick tock (tick tock)
Funk around the clock
Poot butt
Pre-P, pocket-pickin' petty piss poor punkass punks
Posin' to be perpetrators, posin' with the funk
Proudly displayin' your P-Funk signs
Quit it, I ain't wit it
Get them dick beaters off of the microphone
(Your poetry stink)
Take your dead ass home
Shit, piss, hell, damn, fuck
What kind of language is that you honorary cuss?

What's on top of the house? ROOF
What's in the top of your mouth? ROOF
What's Babe's name? ROOF

We come to tear the what off? ROOF

They raise your rent, we raise the roof

Nothin' gettin' next to this shit, next to this shit
This is some next shit, you can get it, next to nothin'
Nothin' gettin' next to this shit, next to this shit

Watch the watchdog watchin' it all on a stopwatch
The kooks going coo-koo for a sun clock
No loudspeakers, but I'm speaking outloud
Vehnacular ass-kickin' truth out a crowd
The tick was clockin' the tock
Doggin' every muthafuckin' hickory dickory dock
Mice runnin' up a muthafuckin' clock
What time is it?
Funk is what time it is

What's on top of the house? ROOF

// Just Say Ding //

YO--HO--HERE WE GO AGAIN
LOOK-OUT
Just say ding-dong and I'm sprung
I spring every time a bell is rung
I'm not a ding-a-ling, I'm not a ding-dong
Mine is another story
Told of a god-damn laboratory

Biological, illogical
Where's the logic in a rod
That's lodged in your head till your dead
Fuck the dumb shit!
AHHH! Just cuz you're the top of the food chain, you want to suck and fuck with my brain
All in the name of science!
SCIENCE (blinded me with science)
Data? What the fuck do data matter to me?
I ain't tryin' to hear that, see but you want me to see it your way
Ding-dong, here we go another day

One dingie-lingie, I salivate
Two dingie-lingies, and I hallucinate
Three dingie-lingies and ejaculate

Recess. Ding-Dong Mutha-Fucka
Just say ding and dong and I'm sprung
Spring every time a bell is rung
I ain't no ding-a-ling and I ain't a ding-dong

Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'?
Yes, I'm listenin', in the middle of July, high on a mission
A nickle bag of Tinkerbell, boy
(Nickle bag of tinkerbell)
As the bell tolls for the time it takes me to inhale
Invoke the rhyme rippin up the track
Derailin' your train of thought
All along the watchtower, watch the faces all go sour, as the bell toll for experiment failed
Though, still the lying media cries success

There's no dongs but I hear dinging
There's no bells but my ears are ringing

One dingie-lingie. I salivate
Two dingie-lingies, and I hallucinate
Three dingie-lingies and ejaculate

I'm the product of a Pavlovian experiment

We rub each others cheeks
We sniff each others seats
We tug each others leash
When we find each other in heat
We scratch each others fleas
And put each other at ease
Which leads me to believe
"When in Dogtown. do as dogs do"

I'm the product of a Pavlovian experiment

We rub each others cheeks
We sniff each others seats
We tug each others leash
When we find each other in heat
We scratch each others fleas
And put each other at ease
Which leads me to believe
"When in Dogtown, do as dogs do"

Genetic engineering, classical conditioning
I'm the product of a Pavlovian experiment

It's a dog-eat-dog world, that's what they say, but I ain't with it
If the label don't say "kitty-kat" I won't eat it
But I got a pair of milkbone drawers on
If you want to get busy, bitch, come on

I was on your trail, sniffin' your tail
You know damn well it smell like hell, ew
Dog-eat-dog world, turn boy-eat-girl world will prevail
Licensed flea collars for sale
Up in this county-funded kennel
With all the incidentals paid up front
So jump the gun and
Go fetch like Fido, Bitch
Spread that mit, yes we play catch
This one here's goin' out the park, throw that ball back, baby
Hark, who goes there?
Cause I'm standin' guard in all this here parts of the yard
When in dog town do as dogs do
(Classical conditioning, test tube puppy
Behavioural modification, man's best friend)
(Somebody get me another animal)

At the sound of the bell there will be a test
A test?
Yes, a test to decide
How much of which pesticide
I'm not a ding-bat, I'm not a dumb-bell
Mine is another humdinger
Where's the DATA that matter to me?
Where's the DATA that matter to me?
Welt the experiment failed, we need another dog
Will somebody get me another dog?

One dingy-lingly, I salivate
Two dingy-lingies and I hallucinate
Three dingy-lingies and I ejaculate

One dingy-lingly, I salivate
Two dingy-lingies and I hallucinate
Three dingy-lingies and I ejaculate

// Help Scottie, Help //

Money, dinero, mossadie, mucho guinneia
Yen, franc, grip, dubloon
"But do you DO foodstamps?"
"BITCH!"
"Help, Scottie, help. I'm tweaking and I can't beam up!"
You're chewing Doublemint. Thafs a good gum."
"SO."
"Yeah. I like Doublemint. Could I have some?"
"NO."
"OH!

"Yeah, you got that right!"
"What?"
"Yo, I don't believe I know him."
"Call him Scottie, Stella."
"Is he the same Scottie from 'Star Crack llluminati?"
Yeah, where ya get
Lit up and enlightened with your "highbeams" on
Aw, hell

Ease up off my rock, 'cause you can't stand, shit's too deep
You wanna cop but you can't hang 'cause you too weak
You cold be hawkin' for a crack o' what I got
But you pull back, 'cause you can't afford the shit, the shit ain't cheap
I'll have you tweakin' for whatever you hope I might drop
You see me comin'
You come runnin' top speed up the block
Hopin' Scottie stops you get put down much
Lower level to da curb kibble after kibble
I can't be rerocked, rinsed, pushed
One hit is all you get
And there'll be no gettin enough of this good shit
Folks be lyin' when they said
"I had enough."
Scottie, just push it down and cool
Watch 'em smoke it up
Double up action ain't shit, get three for twenty or trey
'Cause every hit, be bein' a pocket full of money, ya see here
I stay paid, my Me bein' the reason
I got 'em sprung and they're gettin' me rich season outta season

Say, Homey Girly, you wanna do somethin' for somethin'
Well, go on get your knees dirty
Like you think you got somethin' comin'
Yeah, thatta girl, don't stop, aw shit, look
Plakka plakka one time bitch
SMOKE ALL THE ROCKS, QUICK!
Two to five turns to suspension is not a joke to me
Don't tell the D.A
They got a muthafuckin' thang from me
Once again the gafflin's on
But you be goin' up the river alone, cuz
Scottie gonna trip like that there

Do you ever find yourself often calling Scottie
But do you ever find yourself often calling Scottie
Do you ever find yourself often calling Scottie
I'm tweaking and I can't beam up

O.K. with no delay I say
Scottie say, "Tweak." Look on the floor
There it go, over by home-boy fee
Don't put that shit on my_
Bitch,_what it come from
Are you retarded, plumb loco-like, or is you just plain dumb?
I know your kind, you wanna rerock that shit with Puerto Rican Rum
With your fingers crossed
Over your wishful thinkin' table cloth
Travelin' from the plate to the floor of your mouth to the pipe of your lungs
You asshole eatin' pyharea at the gums
Havin' no hustlin' crumb-snatchin'
Sack-chasin', pipe-scrapin' to' down bitch
What do it take to pry your lip loose from that pyrex prick?
Scottie de-lippin ya down, look atcha, tore down
Whatcha do which your grip, you can't say shit
Whatcha got to show for it?
The answer is "Ain't got nothin'"
'Cause you be too busy basin'
Now you're left with both, pipe-pusher
I'm the mighty Scottie
Cluckers tick me off without tryin'
Some o' ya goin' be losin' yo' malia license tonight
Due in part to how you cluck with for shit
You're not a legal malia, nigga'
Fuck all that too legit to quit shit
I got your best bitch addicted
She took just one look at my shooter and
Licked it, I said, Hold up Ho'
Why don't your raise up of my caddy
You fingernails is dirty
And your titties is TOOO flabby
I 'member that day I watched you yank that bust
Remember thinkin' to myself
What would I do if the buster
Was to bash your motherfuckin' brain?
Not a motherfuckin' thang
But holler, Yo homey PIPE, yeah
And to hell with wholesale nigga, pay all of mine
Dig deep into the corners of your pockets
And come up with some legal tender
Quit window shopping, nigga
That party your wife threw in the bathroom didn't include you
The bitch had a plunger
Trying to unclog the residue-due out the pipe
Heaven's sakes, get the bitch outta my face
I had to run this way
And throw the rocks the other way
Hope the bitch chase the rocks
Dissed the hand that slings the rocks
Show back up and bring the rock
And serve them to another clucker
Two cluckers are each other's adversary
One's a thief and one's an easy skeeze-berry
I don't want those cluckers near me
You muthafuckers smoke that street
Formula bullshit all day long
But Scottie
Like the song goes, so goes the story
When her head was on tight
She was everything that anyone could be

Help Scottie Help
I'm tweaking and I can't beam up

// Back Up Against The Wall //

Don't let them tell you I won't come or I'll be late
Don't listen when they say I pause or hesitate
Turn away when they hint or insinuate
Like a nosebleed I'll be runnin' red like
I'm exceedin' the speed limit
In a hurry to put my eyesight on you, girl

Put my back up against the wall
I might stumble but I won't fall
I'm just dyin' to get in touch with all I'm livin' for

Got me back into the wall
I might stumble but I won't fall
Got me back into the wall, baby

Don't be surprised if you find out I'm on your trail
Don't be alarmed to find me hot on your tail
Don't cha turn me in don't turn me 'round
Don't turn your back 'cause like a choo choo
I'll be jumpin' train tracks avoiding trains on the same track
The only collision will be when I collide with you, girl

Put my back up against the wall
I might stumble but I refuse to fall
I'm just dyin' to get in touch with all I'm livin' for

Got me back into the wall
I might stumble but not fall
Got me back into the wall, baby

Got me back into the wall
I might stumble but not fall
Got me back into the wall, baby

Don't let them tell you I won't come or I'll be late
Don't listen when I pause or hesitate
Turn away when they hint or insinuate

// Tales That Wag The Dog //

It takes more than a collar, a chain to restrain me
You tried to muzzle me
No shame in my game, speaking but no spoken to
Tweakin' off a toke or two

That dope's teasingly teasin'
Teasin' my nose
This dope's pleasingly pleasin' and
I'm pleasingly froze
All wired up but I'm hangin'
I heard bells ringin'
If you slingin', this mobile dope dog knows

Bow-wow-wow goes the yippee yea yo track
And I'm back
Storytellin' about the payroll stack
That I'm out to get loud about
Who cares about the anything whatsoever
To do or to pursue, fuck it
I bark about you, punk, high rollers
Cold duckits
Yea, I'm spillin' the beans on the kingpins
And drugloards
Just say no, my ass, this is a drug war
Punk nigga need you ask, do I need?
How can you help me fool?
Just gimme somthin' I can say you simps
Tried to sell me
Yea, my mission is to point you out
He got it there it goes toss his punk ass in the pen

His defense position is irrelevant
And all I'll want is the fuckin' evidence
So I can come up and bust the high beam tweak
So what you got to say for yourself, now?
You caught a case and got that look on your face
More power to the hooskow hours you fittin'
To spend days, weeks, months, years, when will it ever end?

Who the hell ever said that crime don't pay?
All I did was play a part in a raid and
I'm paid in full
Save the bullshit for Bandini I can't wait to
See you go up in smoke
Like I dream of Genie
I'll Jack Jack for his Jill
Yo, we'll take bribes Jack
Shit, let's make a deal
Your nuts and bolts were rusted
Now you busted, your mama's so disgusted
With you and the slap stupid ass
Shit you have tendencies to do cause
You's a damn fool, nigga

I see myself in your shoes sometime
But today I do the dope and you do the time

What you finna to do with that there pooper scooper stupid?
This ain't poop, this is dog shit
And a little bit of it will knock an ol' funk
Junky to his knees, nigga please, ruff ruff
Now dig, fuck the cat, 'cause we smooth
We do the dog, like that
(Tracy's 3 lines)

Now, how's about a fat philly full of that
World War II
And that ahhhll you can
Eat bar-b-que, ruff ruff
You make me beg baby, got me moanin'
Foamin' at the mouth
Peein' 'round your house
And ya bark like you don't know it
Thought I heard your whistle
And I don't blow when my red love shows
And my fleas start tickin'
Don't like to do my own lickin'

This ain't puppy love, I knew that when I
Wagged you down
'Cause I went and bought a collar
With my last dollar
Roll over, I want a titty or two or three, it
Doesn't matter to me
You look good bitch, makin' my neck itch
The smell of your booty is all that and a
Milkbone straight off the gravy train
So what's your name?
They call me 68, cause I'm straight
I wanna do you
Scobbie-doo-be-doobe-doobee-do
But don't be doggin' me out
You doggin' me out

Bitch
You think I'm cute, you wanna cuddle, forget it
Fuck a smooch, get on this dick, bullshit

Ruff ruff
You make me beg baby, got me moanin'
Foamin' at the mouth
Peein' 'round your house
And ya bark like you don't know it
Thought I heard your whistle
And I don't blow when my red love shows
And my fleas start tickin'
Don't like to do my own lickin'

This ain't puppy love, I knew that when I
Wagged you down
'Cause I went and bought a collar
With my last dollar
Roll over, I want a titty or two or three, it
Doesn't matter to me
You look good bitch, makin' my neck itch
The smell of your booty is all that and a
Milkbone straight off the gravy train
So what's your name?
They call me 68, cause I'm straight
I wanna do you
Scobbie-doo-be-doobe-doobee-do
But don't be doggin' me out

That dope's teasingly teasin'
Teasin' my nose
This dope's pleasingly pleasin' and
I'm pleasingly froze
All wired up but I'm hangin'
I heard bells ringin'
If you slingin', this mobile dope dog knows

// My Dog //

Here chasin metal rabbits at dog tracks and
Then placin' bets and fadin' 'em
Makin' us do stupid animal tricks
'Bout time we sic them on some shit

(Well, I'll Be Doggone if I would work all day
And I'll Be Doggone if I would bring you my pay
But if I ever caught you running around
Blowing my money all over this town
Then I wouldn't be doggone
Hey, Hey! I'd be long gone)

(It's a doggy affair)

Life is cool here in this canaine
County kennel

Don't sniff some of this shit?
It ain't just a scent, goddamn, you gotta get
Some of this shit up your nose

(It's a doggy affair)

Now this tape is pretty short so we might
Have to talk this dog shit fast
What's happenin' my dog? Yeah
Yeah, I got a nickle bag, a doggie bag
Been defleaded, been deticked and I got
My rabies shot
I'm ready to bury a bone in this muthafucker
Hey, this is the tale that wagged the dog
Yeah, I wanna know why the muthafuckers
When they say "dog," it sounds like
There's somethin' wrong with that shit
You know and when they say "Bitch." Bitch
But they always do a lot of silly shit
But I got a little even the other day
Took some of that
Muthafuckin' shaving cream
Put it around my mouth
Struck my Kujo pose next to the baby
Scared the shit outta that mutha-fucker

Almost bust my side in
Fuck them mutha-fuckers
Well, I got nuthin' to worry about
Kids'll fuck them up if they try to
Do somethin' to me
But you know you gotta get a little even
Every now and then
What? What would I do if I kicked?
Why you ask a silly ass question like that?
Oh yeah, you done start gettin' high now
Now you like talkin', don't you?
What would you do if I catch, catch the cat
That mutha-fucker?

Roof was on top of the house
Roof was on top of your mouth

Put me on another track
