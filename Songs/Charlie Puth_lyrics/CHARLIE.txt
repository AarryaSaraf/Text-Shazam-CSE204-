Album: CHARLIE

// That's Hilarious //

Look how all the tables
Look how all the tables have turned
Guess you're finally realizing how bad you messed it up
Girl, you're only makin'
Girl, you're only makin' it worse
When you call like you always do when you want someone

You took away a year
Of my fuckin' life
And I can't get it back no more
So when I see those tears
Comin' out your eyes
I hope it's me they're for

You didn't love when you had me
But now, you need me so badly
You can't be serious (Ha-ha-ha)
That's hilarious (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Thinkin' I would still want you
After the things you put me through
Yeah, you're delirious (Ha-ha-ha)
That's hilarious (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)

Now you put the blame in
Now you put the blame in reverse
Tryna make me feel guilty for everything you've done
You're another lesson (You're another lesson)
You're just another lesson I learned
Don't give your heart to a girl who's still got a broken one

You took away a year
Of my fuckin' life
And I can't get it back no more
So when I see those tears (When I see those tears)
Comin' out your eyes
I hope it's me they're for

You didn't love when you had me
But now, you need me so badly
You can't be serious (Ha-ha-ha)
That's hilarious (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Thinkin' I would still want you
After the things you put me through
Yeah, you're delirious (Ha-ha-ha, you're delirious)
That's hilarious (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, that's hilarious)
You didn't love when you had me
But now, you need me so badly
You can't be serious (You can't be serious) (Ha-ha-ha)
That's hilarious (That's hilarious) (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Thinkin' I would still want you (Oh, no, oh, oh)
After the things you put me through
Yeah, you're delirious (You're delirious) (Ha-ha-ha)
That's hilarious (That's hilarious) (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)

Ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

// Charlie Be Quiet! //

Charlie, be quiet, don't make a sound
You got to lower the noise a little bit now
If she knows you're in love, she's gonna run, run away

I'm not making the same mistake
Won't be putting my heart on display
I'll just water my feelings down
I'm not going out looking dumb
Telling all my friends how you're the one
Those words never leaving my mouth
But the feeling gets

Stronger, baby
What am I gonna do now
When you touch me?
'Cause it's all getting too loud

Charlie, be quiet, don't make a sound
You got to lower the noise a little bit now
If she knows you're in love, she's gonna run, run away
Charlie, be quiet, don't make a sound
You got to lower the noise a little bit now
If she knows you're in love, she's gonna run, run away

I'm not gonna do more than like
Won't be sleeping over every night
I'll act like I don't even care, yeah
I'm not going out looking dumb
Telling all my friends I've found someone
Then waking up without you there
But the feeling gets

Stronger, baby
What am I gonna do now
When you touch me?
'Cause it's all getting too loud

Charlie, be quiet, don't make a sound
You got to lower the noise a little bit now
If she knows you're in love, she's gonna run, run away
Charlie, be quiet, don't make a sound
You got to lower the noise a little bit now
If she knows you're in love, she's gonna run, run away

If she knows you're in love, she's gonna run, run away

// Light Switch //

Yeah

Why you callin' at 11:30
When you only wanna do me dirty?
But I hit right back
'Cause you got that-that, yeah
Why you always wanna act like lovers
But you never wanna be each others'?
I say, "Don't look back"
But I go right back and

All the sudden, I'm hypnotized
You're the one that I can't deny

But you never wanna be each others'

// There's A First Time For Everything //

Never thought that I would actually miss you
Never thought that I'd be dying to kiss you
But maybe there's a first time for everything
Thinking 'bout you really mess with my heartbeat
Never thought that I would cry for somebody
But maybe there's a first time for everything

Saw her on the TV
Had the bleach pink hair with the ripped jeans
And I thought, "What if I could meet her in real life?" (Yeah)
I found out that we shared friends
So she came to the house on the weekend
And what I had in my head happened later that night (Yeah)

All I need is one little memory
To make all these feelings come back up, yeah

Never thought that I would actually miss you
Never thought that I'd be dying to kiss you
But maybe there's a first time for everything
Thinking 'bout you really mess with my heartbeat
Never thought that I would cry for somebody
But maybe there's a first time for everything

Stayed up, late night
We were trying our best to pretend like
That when the party's done, we'll go our separate ways
But we knew, yeah, we knew
Pretty soon, it would be only us two
Then after what we did, I'd never be the same (Yeah)

All I need is one little memory (I need, oh)
To make all these feelings come back up, yeah

Never thought that I would actually miss you, no
Never thought that I'd be dying to kiss you
But maybe there's a first time for everything
Thinking 'bout you really mess with my heartbeat (Mess with my heartbeat)
Never thought that I would cry for somebody (Oh)
But maybe there's a first time for everything, yeah
Maybe there's a first time for everything

// Smells Like Me //

(One, two, three, four)

Lonely when you're in his arms
Yeah, you know I prayed for that, prayed for that, yeah
Your laundry dipped in my cologne
'Cause you know it takes you back, takes you back

Tell me, do you ever miss me when I'm gone? (Gone)
Wonderin' what body I'll be on (On)
We can reconsider if you want (Want)
Baby, don't forget about me ever-er

I hope the memory's killin' you over there
Don't even front, you know that you just can't compare
What it used to be
I hope your jacket smells like me
My baby, yeah
And when you touch him, does it really feel the same?
Or are you lyin' there, thinkin' about the way
That it used to be?
I hope your jacket smells like me
My baby

Candles, they're the same as mine
But it's not because of me, 'cause of me (Right)
When will (When will) you quit wastin' your time?
Oh, if he knew that you keep little things to remind you

Tell me, do you ever miss me when I'm gone? (Gone)
Wonderin' what body I'll be on (On)
We can reconsider if you want (Want)
Baby, don't forget about me ever-er

I hope the memory's killin' you over there (Over there)
Don't even front, you know that you just can't compare
What it used to be (Oh)
I hope your jacket smells like me
My baby, yeah
And when you touch him, does it really feel the same? (Feel the same)
Or are you lyin' there, thinkin' about the way
That it used to be? (That it used to be, oh)
I hope your jacket smells like me
My baby

Are you sleepin' in my T-shirt again?
How's it feel when you press it, press it
Up against your skin, while you breathe it in
I know that you remember, 'member

I hope the memory's killin' you over there (Over there)
Don't even front, you know that you just can't compare
What it used to be (Yeah)
I hope your jacket smells (Like) like me
My baby, yeah (Baby)
And when you touch him, does it really feel the same? (Don't feel the same)
Or are you lyin' there, thinkin' about the way
That it used to be? (Oh, yeah)
I hope your jacket smells like me
My baby

// Loser //

Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her?
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine, 'cause I

I just might get a little too drunk so I won't think about us
I don't think about what we could have been
And I stay up like three or four nights so I won't dream about us
Wake up with no luck
I just can't win

I should have seen it all along (Ah)
She was one in a million (Ah)
It hurts whenever someone says her name (Someone says her name)
When we were going off and on (Ah)
I guess I really played it wrong (Ah)
I should have never let her slip away

Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her?
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine, 'cause I

I just might been a little too gone when she needed somebody
Up against her body (Ooh) at 2 am
Yeah, and now I keep lying to myself when she's just joking probably
(She's joking probably)
She'll probably call me and we'll be us again

I should have seen it all along (Ah)
She was one in a million (Ah)
Now she's in love and I'm in second place (Damn)

Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her? (Lose her)
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her?
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine, 'cause I

Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my, I'm a loser
(I say) Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my, I'm a loser

Tell me God is real
Do you think about me still
Or am I living for nothing?
Don't know where it went wrong but I'll just take the hint
It's gonna take some adjusting

Oh, I'm such a loser
How'd I ever lose her?
Oh, maybe I must have been out of my mind
Now I'm a loser, why'd I have to lose her? (I'll never)
I'll never recover, I'll never be fine, 'cause I
I'm a loser

Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my
Oh my, my, my, my, I'm a loser (I say)
Oh my, my, my, my (Oh, I say)
Oh my, my, my, my (And I say)
Oh my, my, my, my, I'm a loser

// When You're Sad I'm Sad //

It's the last, it's the last time
Oh, that's what I keep saying about us
In the past, put you back there
I try moving on but you never budge

So I never get to give my love to someone who actually deserves it all
'Cause I turn around and you're there saying, "Please don't go"
So I take you back 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad
Baby, don't do that 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad (Yeah)

Wonder why you're calling me so late when you know I'm gonna worry
I can hear, hear the tears in your eyes when you say, "Please come and get me"

So I never get to give my love to someone who actually deserves it all
'Cause I turn around and you're there saying, "Please don't go"
So I take you back 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad (Yeah)
Baby, don't do that 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad

Oh, you don't understand a goodbye
'Cause it's been over for a long time
You know how to make me fall for you
Just like that
Baby, just like that
Baby, just like that
Baby, just like that
Baby, just like that
Ooh

It's the last, it's the last time
Oh, that's what I keep saying about us
In the past, put you back there
I try moving on but I just give up

Guess I'll never get to give my love to someone who actually deserves it all
'Cause I turn around and you're there saying, "Please don't go"
So I take you back 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad
Baby, don't do that 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad
'Cause you know that you're the best I ever had
Yeah, I'll take you back 'cause when you're sad, I'm sad

// Marks On My Neck //

All I got left are the marks on my neck after you let me go
It's hard to forget when you messed up my head, 'cause I let you get too close, yeah

I should of never have, never have, never opened my heart again
Wasn't worth it
Why did I let you, I let you, I let you get all under my skin
Wasn't worth it

On the surface
You were perfect
But ya didn't really come to stay
Now when I look
In the mirror
I slowly watch you fade away

'Cause all I got left are the marks on my neck after you let me go
It's hard to forget when you messed up my head, 'cause I let you get too close
Now all I got left are the marks on my neck after you let me go
It's hard to forget when you messed up my head, 'cause I let you get too close

I tried to cover it, cover it, cover it with foundation
Didn't help it
Try to get over you, over you, over you but you dug in
And I felt it

On the surface
You were perfect
But ya didn't really come to stay
Now when I look
In the mirror
I slowly watch you fade away

'Cause all I got left are the marks on my neck after you let me go
It's hard to forget when you messed up my head, 'cause I let you get too close
Now all I got left are the marks on my neck after you let me go
It's hard to forget when you messed up my head, 'cause I let you get too close
It's hard to forget when you messed up my head, 'cause I let you get too close

// Tears On My Piano //

I'm sick and tired of singing the wrong words (Words that you don't want to hear)
Tryna play these chords that we danced to (Right before you disappeared)
Hoping that my voice will remind you (Everything that we've been through)
All I make is music for crying (Gonna need some more tissues)
Oh, like a river they fall
Tell me why every song I write sounds so sad, sad, sad

I can't get my mind off you
Baby you're responsible for all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)
Can't think of a melody that makes you come back to me
Got all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)

I'm sick and tired of singing the wrong words (Words that I don't want to say)
Tryna play these chords that we danced to (But they'll never sound the same)
Hoping that my voice will remind you (When the radio comes on)
All I make is music for crying ('Cause you're the only one I want)
Oh, like a river they fall (Like a river they fall)
Tell me why every song I write sounds so sad, sad, sad

I can't get my mind off you (Mind off you)
Baby, you're responsible for all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)
Can't think of a melody (Melody), that makes you come back to me
Got all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)

Yeah, you know who you are
I won't say any names
I just want you to feel what I feel (All these tears on my piano)
So if it's on in your car, I don't have any shame
That every song I write is, I want you back
It's so fucking sad, baby

I can't get my mind off you (Mind off you)
Baby, you're responsible for all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)
Can't think of a melody (Melody) that makes you come back to me
Got all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)
Yeah, you know who you are
I won't say any names
I just want you to feel what I feel (All these tears on my piano)

Can't think of a melody that makes you come back to me
Got all these tears on my piano (All these tears on my piano)

// I Don't Think That I Like Her //

Get her name and get her number
Find out all of the things that we have in common
Never all the differences, oh, yeah
Meet her parents, meet her brother
Then she starts sleepin' over the crib on weekends
Like a real relationship, oh, no

For me, the stars are alignin'
But for her, it's bad timin'
So she just can't be mine

I don't think that I like her anymore
Girls are all the same
All they wanna do is break my heart, my heart (Oh-oh)
I don't think that I like her anymore
Girls are all the same
They just wanna see me fall apart, apart (Oh-oh)

So I hook up on a rebound
And I say that I'm gonna be single for life
But she's so pretty and nice (Pretty and nice)
So I made just one exception
But I find out eventually I'm not her type
Baby, that's the reason why, that

For me, the stars are alignin'
But for her, it's bad timin'
So she just can't be mine

I don't think that I like her anymore (Yeah)
Girls are all the same
All they wanna do is break my heart, my heart (Oh-oh)
I don't think that I like her anymore (No)
Girls are all the same
They just wanna see me fall apart, apart (Oh-oh)

I'm tryin' not to be bitter
But damn it, I'll miss her
'Cause she's one of a kind (One of a kind)

For me, the stars are alignin'
But for her, it's bad timin'
So she just can't be mine

I don't think that I like her anymore
Girls are all the same
All they wanna do is break my heart, my heart (Oh-oh)
I don't think that I like her anymore
Girls are all the same
They just wanna see me fall apart, apart (Oh-oh)

(I don't think that I like her anymore
Girls are all the same
All they wanna do is break my heart)
Then we fall, we fall, fall, fall apart now

I don't think that I like her anymore
Girls are all the same
They just wanna see me fall apart, apart (Oh-oh)

// No More Drama //

Oh, I got no more drama in my life
And it's such a blessing
I'm so glad I finally realized
I'm better without you
I got no more drama in my life
And it's been amazing
I'm so glad I finally realized
I'm better without you, uh

Took a year 'fore I recognized (Recognized)
That our love had already died, uh (Already died)
Baby, I was down bad, I was down bad, now I'm healing, yeah
Some nights you would stay here (Stay here)
Some nights you would disappear (Disappear)
No, I'll never go back, never go back to that feeling

Baby, I ain't even wondering (Ah-ah)
About everything we could've been (Ah-ah)
Ever since you looked me in my eyes
Turned around and said goodbye

Oh, I got no more drama in my life
And it's such a blessing
I'm so glad I finally realized
I'm better without you
I got no more drama in my life (In my life)
And it's been amazing
I'm so glad I finally realized (Yeah)
I'm better without you

You start fights while we're up late (Up late)
Use your lips to manipulate, uh (Manipulate)
Baby, how'd you do that, how'd you do that, make me need it? (Listen)
Some nights you were baby (Baby)
Some nights it was crazy (No)
No, I'll never go back, never go back to that feeling

Baby, I ain't even wondering (Ah-ah)
About everything we could've been (Ah-ah)
Ever since you looked me in my eyes (Yeah)
Turned around and said goodbye (Yeah, oh)

Oh, I got no more drama in my life (In my life)
And it's such a blessing
I'm so glad I finally realized (Yeah)
