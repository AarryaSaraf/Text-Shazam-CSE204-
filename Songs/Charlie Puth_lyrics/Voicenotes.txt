// The Way I Am //

Maybe Imma get a little anxious
Maybe Imma get a little shy
Cuz everybody's trying to be famous
And I'm just trying to find a place to hide

All I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
I don't even know how to explain this
I don't even think I'm gonna try

And that's OK
I promise myself one day

Imma tell em' all
Imma tell em' all that
You could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
Imma tell em' all
Imma tell em' all that
You could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am

That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am

Maybe Imma get a little nervous
Maybe I don't go out anymore
Feeling like I really don't deserve this
Life ain't nothing like it was before

Cuz all I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
If you go and look under the surface
Baby I'm a little insecure

And that's OK
I promise myself one day

Imma tell em' all
Imma tell em' all that
You could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
Imma tell em' all
Imma tell em' all that
You could either hate me (hate me) or love me (love me)
But that's just the way I am

That's just the way I am (I am)
That's just the way I am (I am)
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am

Imma tell em' all
Imma tell em' all that
You could either hate me (hate me) or love me (love me)
But that's just the way I am, am, a-a-a-a-am
Yeah, this is what you wanted
Oh, this is what you wanted
I am, am, a-a-a-a-am
Yeah, this is what you wanted
Oh, this is what you wanted all along

Everybody's trying to be famous
And I'm just trying to find a place to hide

Imma tell em' all
Imma tell em' all that
You could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
Imma tell em' all
Imma tell em' all that
You could either hate me (hate me) or love me (love me)
But that's just the way I am

That's just the way I am (Maybe Imma get a little anxious)
That's just the way I am (Maybe Imma get a little scared)
That's just the way I am (Cuz everybody's trying to be famous)
That's just the way I am

Imma tell em' all (That's just the way I am)
Imma tell em' all that (That's just the way I am)
You could either hate me or love me (That's just the way I am)
But that's just the way I am

// LA Girls //

Told you I'm moving out to bigger and better things
Guess you never know what good you got until it's gone
Thought I could find somebody new who could take your place
The list goes on and on and on

There was Nicky, Nicole, Tiffany and Heather
But there's only room for you in my world
But you say that I change like the East Coast weather
How the hell did I get caught up messing with these LA girls

(I miss my baby, I miss my baby) LA girls
(I miss my baby) Messing with these LA girls

Boy, I miss the days we'd take a Greyhound in NYC
Wish I could've seen that it was perfect how it was
Listen, I don't want this to be the way you remember me
'Cause I know I was wrong, wrong

There was Nicky, Nicole, Tiffany and Heather
But there's only room for you in my world (only you my world)
But you say that I change like the East Coast weather
How the hell did I get caught up messing with these LA girls

(I miss my baby) LA girls
(I miss my baby) Here we go, messing with these LA girls

// How Long //

Alright

I'll admit, I was wrong
What else can I say, girl?
Can't you blame my head and not my heart?
I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved

She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?" Yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know"

How long has this been going on?
You've been creeping 'round on me
While you're calling me "baby"
How long has this been going on?
You've been acting so shady
I've been feeling it lately, baby

I'll admit, it's my fault
But you gotta believe me
When I say it only happened once
I try and I try, but you'll never see that
You're the only one I wanna love, ooh, yeah

She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?"
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know"

How long has this been going on?
You've been creeping 'round on me
While you're calling me "baby"
How long has this been going on?
You've been acting so shady
I've been feeling it lately, baby

How long has it been going on, baby?
You gotta go tell me now

She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?" Yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know"

How long has this been going on?

You've been creeping 'round on me
While you're calling me "baby"
How long has this been going on?
You've been acting so shady
I've been feeling it lately, baby
How long has this been going on?
You've been creeping 'round on me
(How long has it been going on, baby?)
How long has this been going on?
(You gotta go tell me now)
You've been acting so shady
I've been feeling it lately, baby

Well if you wanna leave there ain't nobody stopping you

// Patient //

These mistakes I made my fair share
When you needed me, I wasn't there
I was young, I was dumb, I was so immature
And the things that I did made you so insecure
But baby I'm still your man I swear

Please be patient with me
Please be patient with me
I know I'm not what you need
But baby I'm gonna be
So please be patient with me

Is it too much that I'm asking for
Can we start over, can we end this war
I've been taking your love, I've been wasting your time
But is there still a chance of me changing your mind
Before you go walking out the door

Oh you know I'm not perfect
If you leave I deserve it
But baby all I'm asking you is please, please

Please be patient with me
Please be patient with me
I know I'm not what you need
But baby I'm gonna be
So please be patient with me

Oh you don't wanna wait another minute
You don't wanna wait another night
Just trust me, just trust me
Just trust me baby
You don't wanna wait another minute
No, you don't wanna wait another night
Just trust me, just trust me
Just trust me baby

Please be patient with me
Please be patient with me
I know I'm not what you need
But baby I'm gonna be so
Please be patient with me

Please be patient with me
Please be patient with me, yeah
I know I'm not what you need
But baby I'm gonna be so
Please be patient with me

// If You Leave Me Now //

[Charlie Puth:]
No, this is not goodbye
I swear that I'm gonna change
No, baby, please don't cry
It doesn't have to end this way

'Cause when I think of all the nights I'll be alone
I get terrified
Please don't say goodbye

'Cause girl, if you leave me now
If you give it up and just walk right out
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now (yeah)

[Boyz II Men:]
When did we lose our way?
My whole world was unraveling
And girls driving me insane
There's no road worth traveling

[Charlie Puth & Boyz II Men:]
When I think about all of the nights you're gone (nights you're gone, oh)
I get terrified (I get terrified)
Please don't say goodbye (bye)

'Cause girl, if you leave me now
If you give it up and just walk right out (oh)
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now
Oh, baby, if you leave me now

[Charlie Puth:]
Oh, I can promise if we parted (parted)
And if you left me brokenhearted
Every single night, I'll think about you with someone else
Baby, if you leave me

[Charlie Puth & Boyz II Men:]
Baby, if you leave me now
If you give it up and just walk right out (oh)
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby if you leave me now
Oh girl, if you leave me now
If you give it up and just walk right out
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now
Oh, baby, if you leave me now

// BOY //

These girls tryna lock me down and I always up and leave
But for the first time in a while
I wanna throw away the key

You've been in a couple more relationships than me
Cause you talk a different talk
And you kiss me differently

Now I don't know where to go
After you love me this way
After you love me so good
How are you gonna tell me you don't wanna stay

// Slow It Down //

I got a situation, this girl been stressin' me
Sayin' she better be the only one
My life is complicated, she's only 23
I'm not the guy that she's supposed to love

Oh, the more that I tell her I'm not stayin' over
The harder she makes it to go
Oh, the more that I try to convince her this won't work
The faster she takes off her clothes

Girl, you gotta slow it down (girl, you gotta slow it down)
I'm not tryna fall for you
Girl, you gotta slow it down (girl, you gotta slow it down)
I can't give it all to you
Even though I want to

She knows just what she doin', she fuckin' with my head
Wrappin' her legs so tight around my waist
Two in the afternoon, but, we still ain't out of bed
No matter what, she always gets her way

Oh, the more that I tell her I'm not stayin' over (whoa)
The harder she makes it to go (you make it so hard)
Oh, the more that I try to convince her this won't work (oh)
The faster she takes off her clothes

Girl, you gotta slow it down (girl, you gotta slow it down)
I'm not tryna fall for you
Girl, you gotta slow it down (girl, you gotta slow it down)
I can't give it all to you
Even though I want to
Even though I want to, oh, yeah

You've got to slow it, slow it down, baby
You've got to slow it down
You don't know what you're doin' to me now
You've got to slow it, slow it down, baby
Oh
You've got to slow it down
Oh

Girl, you gotta slow it down (girl, you gotta slow it down)
I'm not tryna fall for you (I'm not tryna fall, baby)
Girl, you gotta slow it down (girl, you gotta slow it down)
I can't give it all to you
Even though I want to
Girl, you gotta slow it down, yeah, yeah

// Change //

Why are we looking down
On our sisters and brothers?
Isn't love, all that we got?
Don't we know everyone's
Got a father and mother?
The day we know we're all the same
Together we can make that change

Look around there are too many of us crying
Not enough love to go around
What a waste of another day
Another good one dying
But I know that the world will change
The day we know we're all the same

Why can't we just get along?
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
We gotta make that change, yeah
Why can't we just get along?

What a waste it would be to deny somebody
Of a chance to be their selves
What a waste it would be if we hurt for nothing?
But I know that the world can change
The day we know we're all the same

Why can't we just get along?
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
We gotta make that change, yeah

I know we could break apart
We don't have to go that way
Not today

Why can't we just get along?
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to yeah
Why can't we just get along?
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
We gotta make that change, yeah

The change, yeah

// Somebody Told Me //

I was just with you on your birthday
And I met your whole family
But on the way home you kept looking at your phone
Couldn't help but ask "Who is that babe?"
And the way you said "Nobody"
I knew the rumors, they were more than just rumors

Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

Somebody told me that you
Got another lover you've been giving it to
Can't believe I believed you, you were my girl
Somebody saw you with him
Now you're tryna tell me that he's only a friend
Can't believe I believed that you were my girl

(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

Lately you've been making excuses
And the stories ain't adding up
But I just go blind when you look into my eyes
Every time that I tried to confront you
There's always somewhere you've gotta run to
The warning signs, they were more than just warning signs

Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

('Cause) Somebody told me that you
Got another lover you've been giving it to
Can't believe I believed you, you were my girl
Somebody saw you with him
Now you're tryna tell me that he's only a friend
Can't believe I believed that you were my girl

(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
You were my girl

Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love
(You were just half in love)
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one
(You were my girl)

Yeah
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

Somebody told me that you
Got another lover you've been giving it to
Can't believe I believed you, you were my girl
Somebody saw you with him
Now you're tryna tell me that he's only a friend
Can't believe I believed that you were my girl
(That you were mine)

(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
You were my girl

Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love
(You were half in love)
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one
(You were my girl)

// Empty Cups //

Ooh, the way that you dance on me makes me not wanna leave
You wanna go upstairs but you don't wanna sleep
All right now, we're in the rhythm
Your boyfriend's no competition
Turn off your phone and blame it on your battery
Hey!

Oh oh oh oh, we're gettin' real real close
Oh oh oh oh, can't let this moment go

Hands on your body like there's no one at the party, just me and you
And these empty cups
If you wanna like I wanna, let me take it to another room
So it's only us
Turn that television up
So nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party, just me and you
And these empty cups

Ooh, girl do you think they'll notice if we slip away
Maybe tomorrow they'll all have something to say
All right now, we're in the rhythm
We don't need no one's permission
End of the night don't mean we gotta separate, whoa

Oh oh oh oh, we're gettin' real real close
Oh oh oh oh, can't let this moment go

Hands on your body like there's no one at the party, just me and you (me and you)

// Through It All //

You could say I lived a crazy life for a man so young
The kind that made me question my faith
Now I'm looking back just wondering where the time has gone
But I guess it's just the price you pay

I've already loved more than I thought I could love someone
I've already felt my heart break, yeah
I've already fell so many times but I got back up
But at least I did it all my way

I've been through it all
Yeah, I've been through it all, yeah
You won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it all

Growing up in this wild city you had to fight or run
Now you know why I'm not afraid, yeah
Maybe it's my recklessness that got me in trouble
But at least I did it all my way

I've been through it all
Yeah, I've been through it all, yeah
You won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it all

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Yeah, I've been through it all
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, oh, mmh-mmh, mmh-mmh

I've been through it all
Yeah, I've been through it all, yeah
You won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it all
You won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it all
