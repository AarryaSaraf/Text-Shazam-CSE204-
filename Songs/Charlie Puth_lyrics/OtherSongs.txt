// After All //

[Charlie Puth:]
I lie awake and realize
That you're better than my dreams
Thought I found love so many times
'Til you showed me what it means

Oh, oh, nothing compares to you
Oh no, baby
They were just doing it wrong
I gave up on love until you made me believe in it after all
After all, mmm

[Elton John:]
If you never fell out of the sky
I don't know what I would do
I wouldn't trade one thousand lives
For the one I have with you

Oh, oh, nothing compares to you
Oh no, baby
They were just doing it wrong
I gave up on love until you made me believe in it after all
After all, oh, ah

[Charlie Puth:]
Baby, after all, oh-oh-woah
It's not the same, not the same, not the same, oh

[Elton John (Charlie Puth) {Both}:]
Oh, oh, nothing compares to you
Oh no, baby
They were just doing it wrong (Doing it wrong)
{I gave up on love until you made me believe in it after all} (After all)
After {all, oh}
Oh, oh, nothing compares to you
Oh no, baby (Oh no, baby)
They were just doin' it wrong (Doin' it wrong)
{I gave up on love until you made me believe in it after all} (After all)
After {all, oh}

Now I just wanna see you less

// Beautiful Corruption //

Midnight, lock all the doors
Keep playing that song all day
Just the sound of traffic
The patron of you switching lanes
San Diego, Hard Rock hotel
Wondering why I came
I said I'll try not to think of you
If you say you don't feel the same

Ooohh, Ooohh
Ohh, you're reluctant cause you know I'll leave you nothing to see
Ooohh, Ooohh,
I'll be self-destructing when your beautiful corruption touches me

Feels like the end of the world
Right in this new poor town
Ohh, I should have kept quiet
Yeah I should have shut my stupid mouth

The long table
The boomerang
Travelling way down south
And it's ironic cause it's probably the last time that you see me around

Ooohh, Ooohh
Ohh, you're reluctant cause you know I'll leave you nothing to see
Oh yeah
Ooohh, Ooohh,
I'll be self-destructing when your beautiful corruption touches me

I said I'll be self-destructing when your beautiful corruption touches me

// Break Again //

Well, I'm crying
And I'm dying
Cause I really thought that you would be the one
And I tried to
Stand beside you
But it was over way before it had begun
I like to think it's all ok
And one day you'll come back and stay with me
Come and stay with me

But now you're gone
And I don't know if I can carry on (carry on)

I don't wanna hear no love songs
And I don't wanna see you at all
Cause I can't afford to have my heart, break again
I just thought that maybe you'd change
But you're still the same the same the same
As you were back then
I've had enough
Enough of you
And I can't let you break my heart again

Lately, everyday now
I go to bed and sleep my life away 'till four
Cause I don't know (cause I don't know)
What it feels like (what it feels like)
To not wake up and run a mile right to your door

You're still gone
And I don't know if I can carry on (carry on)

I don't wanna hear no love songs
And I don't wanna see you at all
Cause I can't afford to have my heart, break again
I just thought that maybe you'd change
But you're still the same the same the same
As you were back then
I've had enough
Enough of you
And I can't let you break my heart again

Why you gotta break my heart again?
And I can't keep holding on...

I don't wanna hear no love songs
And I don't wanna see you at all
Cause my hearts gonna break again

I've had enough
Gave it my all
Just thought you changed
But I was wrong
And now that you're gone (now that you're gone)
You can't break my heart again

Again, you can't break my heart again

// Cheating On You //

It started with a kiss on your momma's couch
2012 was nothin' serious
And then we caught the feels, it got really real
Too good to be true, I guess I thought you was, yeah

Why did I run away, run away, run away?
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah

I know I said goodbye and baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you

Baby, no, oh
Cheatin' on you
Baby, no
Oh, when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you

Thought I could get you back any time of day
Shouldn't have been so cocky, shouldn't have did you wrong
And now I miss you bad, really, really bad
Guess you don't know what you got until it's gone

Why did I run away, run away, run away?
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah

I know I said goodbye and baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you

Baby, no, oh
Cheatin' on you
Baby, no
Oh, when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you

Baby, no
There ain't no lips like your lips
And nobody else feels like this
There's no moving on, I'll admit
If you go away
Yeah

I know I said goodbye and baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you

Baby, no, oh
Cheatin' on you
Baby, no
Oh, when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheatin' on you

I said goodbye
And you said goodbye

// Could've Been //

Yeah
Somebody give me, uh
Somebody give me the answer
Me and you isn't the answer
Me and you isn't
Maybe I'm tellin' myself that
But there ain't nothin' that'll change that
What good would it be, if I knew how you felt about me?

It could've been right but I was wrong
Only think 'bout you when I'm alone
Part of me that cared inside it's gone
And I know, that I can't, get caught up

We could've been
And we tried to pretend
Every now and again
We don't dream about, don't think about what
We could've been
Though I'm holding it in
'Cause I know in the end
You dream about, I think about what
We could've been
We could've been
We could've, damn

// Easier (Remix) //

Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way

Why you always lookin' at your phone?
Watchin' people you don't even know
I can lay here by myself alone
Self alone, yeah
I don't want us to be enemies
So I'm thinkin' maybe I should leave
'Cause you bringin' out the worst in me
Worst in me, yeah

I love you so much that I hate you
Right now, it's so hard to blame you
'Cause you're so damn beautiful
So damn beautiful

Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know that you're always gonna stay the same
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way

Every time that you say you're gonna leave
That's when you get the very best of me
You know we need it like the air we breathe
Air we breathe, yeah

I love you so much that I hate you (Oh)
Right now, it's so hard to blame you (Oh)
'Cause you're so damn beautiful (Oh)
You're so damn beautiful (Oh)

Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know that you're always gonna stay the same
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh (I don't wanna know)
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way

The hardest part of all (Da-da-da-dum-da-da)
Is that we're only built to fall (Is it easier?)

Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh (Oh)
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know that you're always gonna stay the same (Is it easier?)
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go? (Yeah)
I don't wanna know, oh (Oh)
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way

I love you so much that I hate you (Hate you)
Right now, it's so hard to blame you
'Cause you're so damn beautiful

// Enemy //

If, I'm gonna fall
Will you promise me I'll always have a kingdom?
'Cause I, I have it all
But you're taking everything I ever dreamed of

Oh, woah
I'm scared of you now
For putting me through this hell
Saying
Oh, woah
I'm feeling the doubt
A feeling I knew too well

If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'm gonna end up losing everything
If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'll end up being my own worst enemy

If, I had a choice
I suppose I'd have to do it all over
'Cause when, I hear your voice
Part of me just wants to be a little closer

Oh, woah
I'm scared of you now
For putting me through this hell
Saying
Oh, woah
I'm feeling the doubt
A feeling I knew too well

If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'm gonna end up losing everything
If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'll end up being my own worst enemy

Oh, woah
I'm scared of you now
You're not who you said you were
Oh, woah woah
I'm feeling the doubt
Your face is just one big blur

If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'm gonna end up losing everything
If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'll end up being my own worst enemy

If I don't
Breathe a little
If I don't
Breathe a little

// Forgot How To Miss You //

I saw your roommate on my way home
I guess your new place, it must be close
Somehow I see you everywhere I go
That used to fuck me up
I guess I heard enough

Had to love you, hate you, let you go
Had to learn to be alone
Used to feel so much, but now I don't

I finally forgot how to miss you, miss you, yeah
Seeing you happy don't make me, make me sad
It took a minute to get out of the dark
Out of my head, out of my heart
But I (Finally forgot how to)
Finally forgot how to (Finally forgot how to)
I finally forgot how to miss you

I seen those pictures of your new friends
I used to wonder what you told them
If you talked about us (About us)
If you're still in love (In love)
That used to fuck me up
I guess I heard enough

Had to love you, hate you, let you go
Had to learn to be alone
Used to feel so much, but now I don't

I finally forgot how to miss you, miss you, yeah
Seeing you happy don't make me, make me sad
It took a minute to get out of the dark
Out of my head, out of my heart
But I (Finally forgot how to)
Finally forgot how to (Finally forgot how to)
I finally forgot how to

Wish that you were mine (You were mine)
I've lost you but I'm not losing sleep at night (Sleep at night)
It took a minute to get out of the dark
Out of my head, out of my heart
But I (Finally forgot how to)
Finally forgot how to (Finally forgot how to)
I finally forgot how to miss you

Oh, I finally forgot how to miss you
Let you go, let you go
Used to hurt but now I don't

I finally forgot how to miss you, miss you, yeah
Seeing you happy don't make me, make me sad

// Free //

They'll never know just who you are
But they can't turn your bright star dark
They'll try to hold your spirit down
Couldn't do it then, can't do it now

They'll try to tell you who to be
But they can't change the way you feel
Can't tame a wild heart
You are free, free

Free as the grass that's right under your feet
Free as the sky underneath your wings
Free as the wind and the river flowin' to the sea
Free as the feeling they can't take from you
No walls can keep your heart from your dream
Free is just knowin' that you were born to
To be free, free

They'll try to tell you where to go
Try to put chains around your soul
But they could never hold you back
'Cause you were built too strong for that
Can't tame a wild heart

Free as the grass that's right under your feet
Free as the sky underneath your wings
Free as the wind and the river flowin' to the sea
Free

Oh, no one's ever puttin' out that fire inside
Feelin' free's the only way you feel alive
With the wind at your back
Runnin' fast and free

Free as the grass that's right under your feet
Free as the sky underneath your wings
Free as the wind and the river flowin' to the sea
Free as the feeling they can't take from you
No walls can keep your heart from your dream
Free is just knowin' that you were born to
To be free, yeah
Free, yeah
Free, free
Free
Oh, free

// Full Of It //

Does it feel different? Or like it was?
Does he ever send you roses just because
And would he hold you?
All through the night?
Write a half a million songs to make it right

There's no place that I'd rather be
Then when you're here right, next to me

Ooh, is he really gonna love you
Or just let you go? (just let you go)
Baby no-oh, does he really mean it
When he says you're beautiful
Or is he full of shit?

How many times would
He say goodbye?
All he ever seems to do is make you cry
Do you still think of me
every single day?
Cause our life was comfortable in every way

There's no place that I'd rather be
Then when you're here right, next to me

Ooh, is he really gonna love you
Or just let you go? (just let you go)
Baby no-oh, does he really mean it
when he says you're beautiful
or is he full of shit?

Ooh, is he really gonna love you
Or just let you go? (just let you go)
Baby no-oh, does he really mean it
When he says you're beautiful
Or is he full of.

Ooh, is he really gonna love you
Or just let you go? (just let you go)
Baby no-oh, does he really mean it
When he says you're beautiful
Or is he full of shit?

// Girlfriend //

Yeah

Tired of this conversation
We didn't come all this way
To touch a little, kiss a little
All night long
You wanna hear me say it
I know I kept you waitin'
Just a little, just a little
All night long

Can't stop
'Til you're lyin' right here next to me
I should stop
But I think I'll do it anyway

Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend?
I don't wanna play no games
This is more than just a phase
Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend?
If you want it, let me know
We could make this official

Don't we look perfect, baby?
Let's take this further, baby
Just a little, just a little
All night long
If I was your boyfriend, I
I'd be givin' you all my time
Not just a little, just a little
All night long

Can't stop
'Til you're lyin' right here next to me
I should stop (Oh)
But I think I'll do it anyway

Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend? (Oh)
I don't wanna play no games (No games)
This is more than just a phase
Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend? (Oh)
If you want it, let me know (Me know)
We could make this official (For sure)

Hold on, you're makin' me (Oh no, baby, no)
Hold on, you're makin' me (Oh no, baby, my)

// Go Round //

I gotta have you now, it's not an option.
You're taking off your blouse and I'm watching.
In front of your mirror, I turn the curtain down.
I couldn't be any clearer what we're gonna do now.

I wanna see you riding and grinding and
We're gonna get it right we're colliding we're
Gonna have to keep quiet, trying to keep it down.
You're taking off my shirt, for another go round.
For another go round.
For another go round.

I gotta have you now, just can't take it.
I wanna put you down when we're faded.
At the top of your lungs, you'll be screaming my name.
And we've gone too far to call it all the way.

I'll pick you up and lay you on the kitchen counter.
Say you couldn't do without it, I'm okay if you're about it.
Down on every direction, got me hypnotized.
I'm hallucinating, going out of my mind.
For another go round
For another go round

It's like every other evening let me see what you can do.
Yeah, ohohoh I got all this paper, let me throw it all on you.
For another go round.
For another go round.

// Hard On Yourself //

I can see you're struggling
Promise you'll find love again
Yeah, it will be alright
Why are you so hard on yourself?

Yeah, why you gotta try so hard?
Counting calories and carbs
Another trip across the world
I go so hard tryna make you feel just like a queen
You don't need a camera to make a scene
You were born like that, no Maybelline
When you first wake up, you're bad to me

Pop another Addy, no sleep tonight
Can't push the wheel slow, I'm speedin' right
Over to the crib as we need to slide
But you take so long makin' up your mind
All-black dress, Dior bag
And leave ten times, I'll take you back
Why you wanna look like someone else?
Why are you so hard on yourself?

I can see you're struggling
Promise you'll find love again
It will be alright
Why are you so hard on yourself?
Try not to fall apart
You're perfect just the way you are
It will be alright
Why are you so hard on yourself?

Why you gotta compare our lives
To pics you see on your timeline?
Another shot of Hennessy
I try so hard not to act like a dick when I'm 'round your friends
Mood swings up and down again
Hollywood Hills where we play pretend
No one happy, but they're good at fakin' it

Pop up in the party, show face tonight
I don't really smoke, but I need the vibes
You love to get high, she need the flights
Standin' so high, swear she can fly
And just like that, you get sad
Let's go home, girl, this party's so wack
Why you wanna be like someone else?
Why are you so hard on yourself?

I can see you're struggling (Yeah)
Promise you'll find love again
It will be alright (It will be alright)
Why are you so hard on yourself? (Yeah)
Try not to fall apart
You're perfect just the way you are
It will be alright
Why are you so hard on yourself?

Girl, when you look in a mirror
I hope you see what I see clearer
All that I want you to know is that you're perfect the way that you are
Oh, the way you are (Oh, the way you are), ooh
Oh, why are you so hard on yourself?

I can see you're struggling
Promise you'll find love again
It will be alright
Why are you so hard on yourself?
Try not to fall apart
You're perfect just the way you are
It will be alright
Why are you so hard on yourself?

Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh (Yeah yeah)
Oh oh, oh oh...

// Heart Go Crazy //

I'll take a break tonight
Feels like my mind's on fire
Only been a week but all I can think of is you you you
Trying to find a way
To see you again each day
But I'm running out of right things to say

Baby, I could touch the sky
If only you were standing right here by my side
I can wait forever
Just don't tell me "never"
'Cause baby when I look in your eyes

My heart go crazy
It's insanity
Yeah, you're making me, oh
Baby, can you hear
My heart go crazy
It's insanity
Yeah, you're making me, oh
Baby, can you hear my heart go

There's nothing to deny
You make me feel inside
You don't even know how I'm going out my mind mind mind
'Cause there's no where that
I'd rather be than when you're here right next to me
I'm trying to fight it but now I can clearly see

Baby, I could touch the sky
If only you were standing right here by my side
I can wait forever
Just don't tell me "never"
'Cause baby, when I look in your eyes

Everyday and every night

Just don't tell me "never"
'Cause, baby, when I look in your eyes
My heart go (oh oh oh oh...)

Charlie
You know what it is
When you hear that, heh!
Montana

[Charlie Puth:]
I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
Can't you blame my head and not my heart?
I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved, mmh

She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show? ", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know"

How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

Ooo-oh (yeah)
Ooo-oh (encore)
Oooh-ooh-oh

I'll admit, it's my fault, but you gotta believe me
When I say it only happened once, mmm
I try, and I try, but you'll never see that
You're the only one I wanna love, oh, yeah

She said "Boy, tell me honestly"
"Was it real or just for show? ", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies"
"Baby, I just gotta know"

How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

Oooh-ooh-oh
{You know what it is}
{Ey, Montana}

[French Montana {Charlie Puth}:]
P-p-pull up to the club in [?]
Shorty tryin' to rip off the door handle
If you ain't known that, you know now
Shorty Olivia when it come to scandals
T-top down, t-top down
Fell in love with the [?] in the top down
Shorty tryin' to creep and I can't stand it
Creep, creepin' through the window like [?]
Talking to herself goin' crazy
French vanilla got us both going crazy
I-I don't know what you thought
I don't wanna hear I'm sorry, my fault
{How long has this been goin' on?}
Montana

[Charlie Puth:]
You've been creepin' 'round on me

// I Warned Myself //

I warned myself that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself, no good for my health
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why

Do you remember when you told me
I don't have to worry?
He's overseas, out on his tour
He'll be okay without me
You said you had nothing to hide
That you left him long ago
I shoulda known that was a lie

I warned myself that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself, no good for my health
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why

I warned myself that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself, no good for my health
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why

Do you remember when you said
Do not tell anybody?
'Cause if you do I'll be the first
To put my hands around your throat
If you had nothing to hide
Why is no one supposed to know
I shoulda known that was a lie

I warned myself that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself, no good for my health
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why

I warned myself (warned myself) that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself, no good for my health
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, the reason why)

// In The Dark //

Girl sitting right down here
Where its not so crowded
He sees you looking but he's not doing anything about it
Baby, you're looking
In the wrong direction
Because this friction between us
Is just straight perfection
(Why you playing hard to get?)
Ooh Ooh
We don't have the time
Just put your lips on mine, fine lady
Ooh Ooh
Don't you be going very far
Just think of all the crazy little things up in your mind that we'd be doing this minute
If we were in the dark
If we we we were in the dark (dark) woah
If we were in the daaaarkkk
The daaaarkkk
If we were in the dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark
(We we we, we were, we were)
She's spending every other night alone
'Coz all them other guys are blowing up her phone
But she really doesn't know
How good it could be
If she rearranged her plans
And made them with me
I'm not into pressing my luck
But your sexy little body has got me stuck
And I know there's something that I miss
But before I go on, let me tell you this
Ooh Ooh
We don't have the time
Just put your lips on mine, fine lady
Ooh Ooh
Don't you be going very far
Just think of all the crazy little things up in your mind that we'd be doing this minute
If we were in the dark
If we we we were in the dark (dark) woah
If we were in the daaaarkkk

// Kiss Me Before I Fucking Lose My Mind //

I
Should have told
You how I really feel
A little in advance

Then I
Would've had some time
To go and work it out
I think I've lost my chance

For the last 3 years I just hid it so well
Hoping that you'd figure it out because I never could tell it
Straight to your face

Never have I ever woken up in a cold hard sweat
From a dream wondering
If you'd ever say "goodbye"
If I didn't say it first

I'm done
Playing these games
I can't believe what I'm about to say
I won't tell you goodbye
With my love left behind
Kiss me before I
Fucking lose my
Mind

No
No more nights
Drinking to my loneliness
Up till 2 AM

No
No more waiting
Pacing round the bar
Hoping that you might walk in

For the last 3 years I just hid it so well
Hoping that you'd figure it out because I never could tell it
Straight to your face

Never have I ever woken up in a cold hard sweat
From a dream wondering
If you'd ever say "goodbye"
If I didn't say it first

I'm done
Playing these games
I can't believe what I'm about to say
No I won't tell you goodbye
With my love left behind
Kiss me before I
Fucking lose my mind

Oooo...

I'm done
Playing these games
I can't believe what I'm about to say
'Cause I would rather die
Than feeling this inside
Tricks played on my mind
No I would rather die
Than just tell you goodbye
With my love left behind
Kiss me before I
Fucking lose my
Mind

// Life's Good //

Have you ever felt like the world's not on your side?
It feels almost easier to lock yourself away and hide

Good thing that you didn't give up on me, you helped me get up out my head
So who knows where I'd be if you never said

If at first you don't succeed and you fall down to your knees
Oh, you gotta pick yourself back up and try again
If it don't go like it should, just remember life is good
And you gotta pick yourself back up and try again

A thousand reasons made you fall
It's only a passing season, y'all
Why give up, let's give it up
For every minute of your life
Nothing's too late, it's a little delay
When life is sour, I'll be your lemonade

Good thing that you didn't give up on me, you helped me get up out my head
So who knows where I'd be if you never said

If at first you don't succeed and you fall down to your knees
Oh, you gotta pick yourself back up and try again
If it don't go like it should, just remember life is good
And you gotta pick yourself back up and try again

Mama said don't give up
You have already come so far
Don't forget where you've come from
Who you can be and who you are

If at first you don't succeed and you fall down to your knees
Oh, you gotta pick yourself back up and try again
If it don't go like it should, just remember life is good
And you gotta pick yourself back up and try again

// Lights Go Out //

I've been trying, there's no denying
That girl you've got my heart falling so fast
My minds racing, you've got me wasting
My days were endless till I see you pass

And I'm like, (Ooo-ooo)
Baby did I catch your eye? (Ooo-ooo)
Can I see you tonight?

When the lights go out, You know it's going down
The music playing is all we need
When we're all alone, You don't wanna take it slow
Forget it all and come home with me
Come home with me

Take my hand girl, we'll cross this land till
We find a place that we can call our own
Trust in me and I'll set you free
Babe I'm never ever leave you feeling cold

You got me like, (Ooo-ooo)
Tell me I'm the only one (Ooo-ooo)
And I'll see you tonight

When the lights go out, You know it's going down
The music playing is all we need
When we're all alone, You don't wanna take it slow
Forget it all and come home with me
Come home with me
Come home with me
Come home with me, with me
With me me, me, me, me, me, me

When the lights go out, You know it's going down
The music playing is all we need
When we're all alone, You don't wanna take it slow
Forget it all and come home with me
Come home with me
When the lights go out, You know it's going down
The music playing is all we need
When we're all alone, You don't wanna take it slow
Forget it all and come home with me
Come home with me

// Look At Me Now //

I said this time next year
Imma be the one who do
Everything and more you said
I couldn't do
This one is for you
This time next year
I'm gonna be stronger
A little bit taller
Top is my only view

I'm kickin' in the door now
Better get out my way
Never really saw me comin'
You left with nothing to say
This' for everybody
Who've always put me down
I hope you open up your eyes
And take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now

'Cause this time next year
Imma walk down these halls
And show my face for the world to see
Gonna see me
And Imma call every girl that turned me down
And tell 'em now that
I'm just too busy
'Cause I don't have the time

And its funny how my so-called friends
Who've always left me alone
Are suddenly running into me
And blowin' up my phone

I'm kickin' in the door now
Better get out my way
Never really saw me comin'
You left with nothing to say
This' for everybody
Who've always put me down
I hope you open up your eyes
And take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Oh baby
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now

Oh, look at me now
Woah, this one is dedicated
To all of the people
Who said I would be nothing
Just look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now

I'm kickin' in the door now
Better get out my way
Never really saw me comin'
You left with nothing to say
This' for everybody
Who've always put me down
I hope you open up your eyes
And take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now

// Mother //

He's such a nice boy
So well mannered
He's so much better than the last one you've brought around
Please and thank you
Everything matters
I'm gonna make sure that she knows I'm the best she's found

The moment she walks out the door
I'm not pretending anymore

If your mother knew all of the things that we do
(If your mother knew all the things we do)
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
(If your mother knew all the things we do)

Sneak out the window
Pass over pillows
I'll be waiting in the car right around the block
Back of the Benzo
More than the friend zone
We've been hiding since the time they forgot to knock

The moment she walks out that door
I'm not pretending anymore

If your mother knew all of the things that we do
(If your mother knew all the things we do)
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
(If your mother knew all the things we do)

Next time that she sees me, she gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story, now your daddy wants to kill me
Next time that she sees me, she gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story, now your daddy wants to kill me

Yeah
If your mother only knew

The moment she walks out the door
I'm not pretending anymore

If your mother knew all of the things that we do
(If your mother knew all the things we do)
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
(If your mother knew all the things we do)

Next time that she sees me, she gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story, now your daddy wants to kill me
Next time that she sees me, she gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story, now your daddy wants to kill me

(If your mother knew all the things we do)
If your mother knew all of the things that we do

// My Pizza //

Woah-oh-woah
Woah-oh-woah-woah
Yeah

Weren't you the one
That said you weren't hungry
"Just go ahead and eat your food"
I was the only one
That anticipated that dinner would suck
And my order is about to go through

I'm not eating that food
There's nothing you can do
"Can I have some?" You dream, man
My hands up on the mouse
No one better be in this house
Because

This is my pizza
My pizza
It's my slice, my slice, pizza pie
This is my pizza
My pizza
I waited 30 minutes
And now I'm chowing down on my pizza
My pizza
It's my pie, my pie
Not your freakin' pie it's mine
It's my pizza
My pizza
I waited for so long
And now I'm chowing down on my pizza
Ooooooh
Yeah

Tomatoes, hey I'll see you later
I can't eat you right now
Because I hate vegetables
I'm eating so much now
Much I never dreamed of
God, I am so happy
Now I have to throw up
[*throwing up*]

This is my pizza
My pizza
It's my pie, my pie, pizza pie
This is my pizza
My pizza
It's my pie, not your pie
Pizza pie

This is my pizza
My pizza
It's my slice, my slice, pizza pie
This is my pizza
My pizza (oooo)
I waited 30 minutes
And now I'm chowing down on my pizza

// Nothing But Trouble //

[Charlie Puth:]
I'm facing the bottle for all of my problems
These Instagram models are nothing but trouble
She's going away now, I'm going full throttle
All these Instagram models, I said they're nothing but trouble

[Lil Wayne:]
When I met her she was out for love
Yeah, I bought her leather and some diamond studs
Damn, when I met her she was molly'd up
Fuck it, I said "Whatever" cause I'm not a judge
No, all my niggas say she's not what's up
Uh, I considered it but not enough
Uh, she just wanted to be popular
Uh, she just want ten thousand followers
Lord, she posted, she posted, she posted
They like it, they like it, repost it
She party promoting, she hosting
She posing, legs open, provoking
It got my head smoking
I tried to act like I don't notice
Emotions, emotions, emotions, lord

[Charlie Puth (Lil Wayne):]
I'm facing the bottle for all of my problems
These Instagram models are nothing but trouble
She's going away now (Now it's over)
I'm going full throttle (You drive me crazy)
All these Instagram models
I said they're nothing but trouble

[Lil Wayne:]
I had to leave that ho alone and get my mind right
I had to go talk to my friends, I had to find Christ
Lord I had to, open up my eyes and find light
I was so green and all she wanted was that limelight
Lord I, was so blinded by her highlights
She had me not checking my DM's neither my likes
Oh what, you modeling ma? Knock yourself out
Open my heart to you when you lock yourself out
When I met her she was posse'd up
In the section holding bottles up
Oh, she just wanted to be popular
Oh she just want ten thousand followers

[Charlie Puth:]
I should have known from the very start
That you weren't after my foolish heart
No, you liar, liar, liar girl
You got the world thinking you're a star
But Oh, you're not who you say you are
I'm dying, dying, dying, girl

[Charlie Puth (Lil Wayne):]
I'm facing the bottle
(I'm sipping and lighted and dipping in line, but I'm coping)
For all of my problems (I'm too open)
These Instagram models (Glad I left her)
Are nothing but trouble (But I don't know her Lord)
She's going away now (Now it's over)
I'm going full throttle (You drive me crazy)
All these Instagram models
I said they're nothing but trouble

// One Call Away (Remix) //

[Charlie Puth:]
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away

Call me, baby, if you need a friend
I just wanna give you love
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Reaching out to you, so take a chance

No matter where you go
You know you're not alone

I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away

Come along with me and don't be scared
I just wanna set you free
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
You and me can make it anywhere
For now, we can stay here for a while
Cause you know, I just wanna see you smile

No matter where you go
You know you're not alone

I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away

[Tyga:]
Bling my hotline, I'm only one call away
You wanna ball, we only one mall away
Ay, dare I see you again like Charlie say
Again and again, that's always bae
Back when I was poor, I only had a heart to break
We was splitting meals, two straws and a chocolate shake
You had my back and that's true to facts
When you need your boy, pick up the phone and do the math

[Charlie Puth & Tyga:]
I'm only one call away
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Pick up the line, I got you

I'm only one, I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away
I'm only one call away

// Over //

I heard you slammed the door
And fall right to the floor
You kept on crying
That look upon your face
Doesn't cover up
What's under lying
Seeing you like this
Makes me wanna die

We'd lie beneath the stars
Just to foolish hearts
From million faces
Now I lie here all alone
Sitting by the phone
There's too much space here

Oh baby, come back and stay with me

Cause it's not over
Please don't say it's over
Cause it's not over
To me, to me, to me
It's never over to me

My heart, my heart
Is your's, is your's
For yesterdays and for taking it
My heart is broken
You're all that I need
Just don't forget about me
Don't forget about me...

Cause letting you go hurt me

Cause it's not over
Please don't say it's over
Cause it's not over
To me, to me, to me
Ever over you and me

// Ride To Melrose //

My baby left me yesterday,
Packed her bags and went away, yeah.
High heels on the carpet, 
took my keys and craved her name into my car seat.

And that's the last one I let push me around,
I've said it before but I mean it now, eh.
Get me out this city, I just need to clear my mind.

We left this evening, give 'em twenty dollars for some gas in Boston,
grab a bite but now we're taking off, we're taking off, oh.

When we got to Melrose, fifteen nights of April,
We just drank our sorrows, talked about the day we'll have it all,
We'll have it all.

One shot, one shot for my sorrows, oh yeah.
Power up the white noise, maybe I'll forget her deep into the morning.
And right inside this yellow house, 
I'm reading CD's on the couch,
but it's better than being stranded,
nothing but myself in a studio apartment.

We left this evening, give 'em twenty dollars for some gas in Boston,
grab a bite but now we're taking off, we're taking off, oh.

When we got to Melrose, fifteen nights of April,
We just drank our sorrows, talked about the day we'll have it all,
We'll have it all.

I don't think I'm sleeping tonight,
Something 'bout my stomach doesn't feel right,
What you left in my chest on the left side,
Where your he.. nah, fuck it.
Time to take a drive.

Night skies got me feeling like Bruce Wing,
'Cept all I got is a pocket of loose change.
Head and heart got me thinking that I'm too strange.
Well maybe I'm different.

Word to two chainz, two lanes,
Drift grip the wood crane,
Lookin' at the exit signs, but it's your name (damn).
On some purple rain shit, feelin' like Prince,
gotta go and change my name chiz, same shit, ain't it?

Yeah, I know I don't seem complacent,
Got enough on my chest but my heart's still vacant.
And I can't take it,
My love is unreciprocated,
I've been through enough without ever gettin' the payment.
But it's harder to heal than it is to endure,
There's only so much that the liquor can cure,
And all that liquor that's poured gave you a head of a tornado
of every memory that had you trippin' before.

All that Christian Dior denim, Louis Vuitton leather,
led em a late night, safe flight and good weather.
Ain't enough to make me feel better,
Ain't enough to make me forget all those nights in early December.

I think I was dreamin',
But now I know I ain't been sleepin'.
And some of these days, these feelings stoppin' me from eating,
The pit of my stomach is heavy.
I guess that's how it feels when you start to forget me.

I apologize for not caring for myself,
I've never known anything else than putting myself after everyone else,
And that fucks me up, it's true.
These late nights really are new,
And there's so little I can do besides drive.
Lay awake think about where you layin' tonight,
And fantasize about us living life in paradise,
In a warm place where we never really have to die,
But life ain't kind, we can't live fantasy,
I just need to hear that you're maintaining sanity
Cuz it's more important to me that you're doing alright
Than the fact that I'm not sleepin' tonight.

// See You Again (Piano Demo Version) //

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Why'd you have to leave so soon?
Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to leave me when I needed you the most?

'Cause I don't really know how to tell ya
Without feeling much worse
I know you're in a better place
But it's always gonna hurt

Carry on
Give me all the strength I need to carry on

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh

How do I breathe without you?
I'm feeling so cold
I'll be waiting right here for ya
'Til the day you're home

Carry on
Give me all the strength I need to carry on

So let the light guide your way
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh

When I see you again
See you again
When I see you again

// Seventeen //

The stone thrown at your window
It's telling you to get up and get up and go
And to climb down the shakers of your house
To the back of my Chevy and no one will ever know

We drive around November with one light out
They try to pull us over go right ahead
We'll still drive around to find a place to sleep at
And if can't find one backseats gonna be our bed

Oh Melony I don't believe when you tell me that your seventeen and proud
Cause it says so loud
It's not right to hold you through the night
You put up no fight when I put words in your mouth, oh yea

We drive around November with one light out
They try to pull us over go right ahead
We'll still drive around to find a place to sleep at
And if can't find one backseats gonna be our bed

She ripped off the grass and threw it on my face
I pushed her over laughing right away
She said the moonlight makes the windows in your eyes
Kiss her inside out with no goodbye bye

I remember waking up in the middle of the night
On the brick shear highway
It's not right but oh I can't fight it anymore
Do you remember waking up in the middle of the night
On the brick shear highway
Ohh it's not right yeah I can't fight it anymore

I can't fight
I can't fight it anymore

// Sexy Shades //

These are my sexy shapes
Super, super, super sexy shades
These these are my sexy shoes
These are my sexy shapes

Not not sexy shoes
These are my sexy shades
Sexy break down

A worm in the street and a worm in the park
And where I'm in the light and aware
I'm in the dark side
You can not where I'm like me and
My shades are just too damn sexy

Where I'm on the bridge
Jump to your porch where I'm on the bridge
And show them to a random guy, isn't she?
Not where I'm like me

My sexy shapes are just to Bob Saget
I was walking down the street
Pop in into the beat

And this guy said, You're okay with this
These are sexy
She puts you in the face
No

These are sexy and super, super duper sexy shades
These are my sexy shades
These are Miss Sexy Shapes
Not not yo sexy shakes
These are sexy shades

// Spend The Night //

Monday you hate to drive home
With a million red lights on the strip
That night I come to your door
You're the one I've so desperately missed

Do you remember always staying home with me and watching friends
Well I'd do anything for that again

Come spend the night here with me up in Boston
Don't leave me here all alone
And I wonder if you'll feel the same way tomorrow
If you see me calling your phone

In my fantasy, I see you next to me
Every night, every day
This empty room feels so strange
Wanna stay, here with you
Go all the way, this afternoon
You caught me with nothing to say
(Caught me with nothing to say)

Do you remember when I'd always lie with you 'til 3 a.m.
I'd give anything for that again

Come spend the night here with me up in Boston
Don't leave me here all alone
And I wonder if you'll feel the same way tomorrow
If you see me calling your phone

Ooh, baby

Come spend the night here with me up in Boston
Don't leave me here all alone
And I wonder if you'll feel the same way tomorrow
If you see me calling your phone
When you'll see me calling your phone, your phone
When you see me calling your phone

// Tangerine Dreams //

You sing yourself to sleep at night
Melodies behind closed doors
I'm over by the corner
Listening to you from the second floor
I open up the curtains
To hear the thunder and the rain
We dropped off all the flowers
To wash away the pain
Wanna go with you anywhere, anywhere
Wanna go with you anywhere
I'm sorry I kept you waiting
I have no excuse
There's no room for debating
Why it took so long to get back to you
Wanna go with you anywhere
But these tangerine dreams will not go away
Build them right up and mold them out of clay
They just keep me company
Now I take everyday with a deep breath
Cause I found out the hard way when he left
Suffering silently
Wanna go with you anywhere
These last couple days I haven't been myself
Cause I know I won't be seeing you on commonwealth again
Commonwealth again
These last couple days I haven't been myself
Cause I know I won't be seeing you on commonwealth again
Commonwealth again

// That's Not How This Works //

Thought, the day you disappeared, that it was over
Didn't even hear you leavin'
Saw you with someone and thought that it was closure
But you still tell me that you need me

Quit messin' with my head

You can't say you hate me, then call me when you're hurt

// The Pickle Song //

Aw yeah
What?
I have a little story to tell you
And it goes like this

I was walking down the street, bitch, walking down the street
Walking down the street with shoes at my feet
But then I saw a glimpse from the corner of my eye
I saw this smokin' hot broad walk by
I said, "Yo baby, what's up?", she said "you talkin' to me?"
"Well, duh, there's no one else on the street"
"You're coming back to my place" this how it's gonna be
But then something hit my face

Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
Can't you see I'm tryna mack this bitch?
Who threw this pickle at me?

Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
I tried to keep calm, tried to gain my composure
Bitch, this ***'s not even kosher

The next day, nothing's new
Sitting on this seat like I always do
Saw them other bitches walkin' my way
"Man... I need a bagel"

Eating at the deli with my bagel and jelly
While I'm observing the trees
Gosh, how did they get so green and plump?
Wait, what just hit my face? Oh my...

Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
Can't you see I'm tryna eat my bagel?
Who threw this pickle at me?

Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
I tried to keep calm, tried to gain my composure
Bitch, this ***'s not even kosher

// Titanium //

You shout it out
But I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud, not saying much
I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down, but I get up

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium

Cut me down
But it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town and haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud not saying much

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium

// Two Months //

I'll miss you singing Stevie Wonder
Isn't she lovely till 3 a.m.
When you'd always look into my eyes
I never wanna say goodbye
Sitting and waiting for it to happen again

But for every time I saw you block my call
I wish I'd never been with you at all

You got your sold-out shows, your perfect hair
But when it comes to me, baby, did you ever care?
I've never met nobody who talks about themselves so strong
So strong 

You got your big red car, your fancy clothes
How I ever fell for you, I'll never really know
Two months never felt so long
Long, so long

I'll miss the trips to New York City
Listening to you from back stage
After all these hours pass me by
You just need some time with the guys, what about me?

Every time you say I waste your time
I wish you and I could go and press rewind

You got your sold-out shows, your perfect hair
But when it comes to me, baby, did you ever care?
I've never met nobody who talks about themselves so strong
So strong

You got your big red car, your fancy clothes
How I ever fell for you, I'll never really know
Two months never felt so long
Long, so long

You got your big red car, your fancy clothes
How I ever felt for you, I'll never really know
Two months never felt so long

// We Can't Stop //

Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
'Cause we came to have so much fun now
Bet somebody here might get some now

If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a "Hell, no!"?
'Cause we're gonna go all night
'Til we see the sunlight, alright

We like to party
Dancing with Molly
Doing whatever we want

// When She Kissed Me //

I took her out to dinner
I thought I'd had a winner
And what happened next came to a surprise to be
So I walked her to her front door
Waiting for what I had hoped for
But then she hugged and said goodnight to me
As I took my bad, stepped off that porch, I saw a friend of mine
She stepped closer then grabbed my hand and met me eye to eye

That's when she kissed me and knocked me off my feet
Never have I ever felt this way
I was lookin' for a girl just like her
And I think I've found her
And I'll always let her know that I will never let her go
Whoa...

So I took her down to the shoreline
The weather that day was so fine
And not to mention she looked pretty good too
And later at the movies, romantic comedy
I hate those films but for her I managed to get through
I walked her to her front porch as we said our goodbyes
As I desperately tried to say something
She put her finger on my lip and said one more thing

She kissed me and knocked me off my feet
Never have I ever felt this way
I was lookin' for a girl just like her
And I think I've found her
And I'll always let her know, that I will never let her go
Whoa...

It's nice to know that she cares enough about me
I never saw saw this coming, and my heart's constantly drumming
And whenever she's around I'll never ever feel the same
About that other girl's name

Because she kissed me and knocked me off my feet
Never have I ever felt this way
I was lookin' for a girl just like her
And I think I've found her
And I'll always let her know that I will never let her go
Whoa...

// Your Name (The Ukulele Song) //

This goes out to the most beautiful girl that I saw just the other day
She had me slipping and she had me falling for her right away
This goes out to the one and only miss mysterious
Thought of me being next to her got me so delirious
Yeah is she out is she out there
Yeah is she out there

Cause you're all that I need in every single way
Girl you got me love sick and your beauty is to blame
If you knew how I felt cause you never feel the same
Never been acquainted I just need to know your name
Girl I just need to know your name

Before I saw your face
I never in my wildest dreams
Thought that true love was actually real
Cause you shine way brighter
Than anything I might have thought that I could feel
I give it all everything I have even though it's all so new
Cause I want you in the worst of ways
Can you make my wish come true
Is she out there is she out there
Just tell me if you're out there if you're out there

Cause you're all that I need in every single way
Girl you got me love sick and your beauty is to blame
If you knew how I felt cause you never feel the same
Never been acquainted I just need to know your name
Girl I just need to know your name

Hey need to know your
Need to know your name
Hey hey
I need to...

Cause you're all that I need in every single way
Girl you got me love sick and your beauty is to blame
If you knew how I felt cause you never feel the same
Never been acquainted I just need to know your name
Cause you're all that I need (in every single way)
Girl you got me love sick and your beauty is to blame
If you knew how I felt cause you never feel the same
Never been acquainted I just need to know your name
Girl I just need to know your name
