Coachella, you ready?
Let's go get 'em
Yes! So crazy right now!
Most incredibly, it's your girl, yes, B
History in the making
Part two, it's so crazy right now

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
Yeah, I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so, looking so, looking so

Drop it
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, uh oh, oh no no

(B)
When I talk to my friends so quietly
("Who he think he is?")
Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
You ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
The beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now (Yeah)
Got me looking so crazy right now (So, crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
So crazy right now, so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now (Hey)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Hey)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Coachella)
So crazy right now, so crazy right now (Y'all dance with me, come on)

Painting white flags blue

Running blind in truth

// So Much Damn Swag (Interlude) (Homecoming Live) //

I grew up in Houston, Texas
Visiting Prairie View
We rehearsed at TSU
For many years in Third Ward
And I always dreamed of going to an HBCU
My college was Destiny's Child
My college was traveling around the world
And life was my teacher
I wanted a black orchestra
I wanted the steppers
I needed the vocalist
I wanted different characters
I didn't want us all doing the same thing
And the amount of swag is just limitless
Like the things that these young people can do
With their bodies and the music they can play
And the drum-rolls and the haircuts
And the bodies and the
It's just not right
It's just so much damn swag

// Sorry (Homecoming Live) //

Let me hear you sing

Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry, nigga, nah
Sorry, I ain't sorry
Sorry, I ain't sorry
I ain't sorry

He trying to roll me up (I ain't sorry)
I ain't picking up (I ain't sorry)
I'm headed to the club (I ain't sorry)
I ain't thinking 'bout you (I ain't sorry)
Me and my ladies sip my D'USSÃ cup (I ain't sorry, I ain't sorry)
I don't give a fuck, chucking my deuces up
Suck on my balls, pause

Bug a boos, I need a good laugh
You, make me laugh
(Bug a boos)

Did that make us laugh?
Think about it
(Bug a boos)

Fall in line
Ladies, ladies, ladies
Are we smart? (Yes)
Are we strong? (Yes)
Have we had enough of the bullshit? (Yes)
Show 'em

Suck
On my balls
Suck on my balls
Suck on my balls, bitch
Suck
On my balls
Suck on my balls, balls
Hell nah
Hell nah

Middle fingers up (Middle fingers up)
Put them hands high (Put them hands high)
Wave it in his face (Wave it, wave it in his face)
Tell him, "Boy, bye" (Tell him, tell him, "Boy, bye")
Let's go
Tell him, "Boy, bye", tell him, tell him, "Boy, bye"
Tell him, "Boy, bye", tell him, tell him, "Boy, bye"
Tell him, "Boy, bye", tell him, tell him, "Boy, bye"
I ain't thinkin' 'bout you

Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him, "Boy, bye"
Tell him, "Boy, bye, boy, bye"
Middle fingers up, I ain't thinkin' 'bout you

No, no, hell nah

Now you wanna say you're sorry
Now you wanna call me crying
Now you gotta see me wilding
Now I'm the one that's lying
And I don't feel bad about it
It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding

I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past
Foolish of me to dream while you cheat with what
Whit loose women
It took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I've got

Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
(I see you, how did you do that so fast? She has on my outfit, y'all)
Sing it
(Me, myself, and I) Sing it
(That's all I got in the end)
(That's what I found out) Found out
(And it ain't no need to cry) Sing it ladies
I took a vow that from now on, I'm gon' be my own best friend

Right, ladies? Yes

I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my woadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair

// Kitty Kat (Homecoming Live) //

I rock diamonds on my neck
Got diamonds on my records
Since fifteen, comin' down reppin' Texas
How you gonna neglect this?
You was just a hot mess
You can call Tyrone, you ain't gots to lie Craig

What about my body, body?
You don't want my body, body
Acting like I'm nobody
You gon' make me call somebody

I think it's time to go

Coachella, thank y'all so much for having us once again
I'm so honored to be on this stage tonight
And this next song is for all of my queens
Do we have any beautiful queens in the house tonight?
I want y'all to sing along if you know the lyrics
It's called "Bow Down"

I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of bein' in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches

But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted

Rolling high, leather and wood
Keep it trill, that's what good
Kiss my mama, show that love
Pop them bottles in that club
I heard your crew was talking lip
Guess what I did? Smack that trick
Smack that trick
Guess what I did? (Smack that trick)
Gold everything, gold ass fangs
Gold ass chains, gold ass things
You can see me stunt when you turn on the screen
You can-you can see me stunt when you turn on the screen
I'm bigger than life, my name in the lights
I'm the capital B, I don't need no hype
The capital B mean I'm 'bout that life
The capital B mean I'm 'bout that life, bitch

// Drunk In Love (Homecoming Live) //

I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
Get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
(Coachella, I wanna hear y'all sing)
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, now-now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you
Drunk in love
(How y'all doin' over here?)
I want you

We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby (I can see you all the way, all the way back there)
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love
(Sing it, y'all)

We be all night (Sing, come on, sing)
We be all night (Sing, hey)

We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints 'cause my body so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-Eleven
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin', if you scared, call that reverend
(Boy, I'm drinkin') Get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic 'til my voice hoarse
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard (Surfboard)
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin', grainin' on that wood (Wood)
I'm swervin' on his, swerve-swervin' on his big body Benz
Surfin' all on his (Surfs up)
