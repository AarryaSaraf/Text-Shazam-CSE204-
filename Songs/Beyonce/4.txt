// 1+1 //

If I ain't got nothing, I got you
If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn
'Cause I got it with you
I don't know much about algebra, but I know 1+1 equals 2
And it's me and you
That's all we'll have when the world is through

'Cause baby, we ain't got nothing without love
Darling, you got enough for the both of us
So come on, baby, make love to me

When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go, make love to me
So when the world's at war, let our love heal us all
Right now, baby, make love to me
We, me, me, me
Oh, make love to me

Hey, I don't know much about guns, but I
I've been shot by you, hey
And I don't know when I'm gon' die, but I hope
That I'm gon' die by you, hey
I don't know much about fighting, but I
I know I will fight for you, hey
Just when I ball up my fist, I realize
I'm laying right next to you

Baby, we ain't got nothing but love
And darling, you got enough for the both of us
Ooh, make love to me

When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go, make love to me
So when the world's at war, let our love heal us all
Help me let down my guard
Make love to me, me, me, me, me
Oh, oh, make love to me, me, me, me, me

// I Care //

I told you how you hurt me, baby
But you don't care
Now I'm crying and deserted, baby
But you don't care
Ain't nobody tell me this is love
When you're immune to all my pain
I need you to tell me this is love
You don't care?
Well, that's okay

Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

Ever since you knew your power, you made me cry
And now every time our love goes sour, you won't sympathize
You see these tears falling down to my ears
I swear, you like when I'm in pain, yeah
I try to tell you all my fears
You still don't care?
That's okay

Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

Boy, maybe if you cared enough
I wouldn't have to care so much
What happened to our trust?
Now you're just given up
You used to be so in love
Now you don't care no more

Well, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby
Oh, I care
I know you don't care too much
But I still care, baby

I still care

// I Miss You //

Let the mother-fucking beat build in this bitch
About that

I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you
Why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you around

I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

The words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean 'em
Why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to
Why is that?

I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything

I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away (But you're away)
Said I miss you, missing you insane
But if I got with you, could it feel the same?

It don't matter who you are
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything
No matter who you love
It is so simple
A feeling
But it's everything

Another world, another life

// Rather Die Young //

Boy, you'll be the death of me
You're my James Dean
You make me feel like I'm seventeen
You drive too fast
You smoke too much
But that don't mean a thing, 'cause I'm addicted to the rush

'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you

You know I've been in love before
You're the first one I've ever seen that burns like gasoline
So light a match, turn off the lights
I'm holding on to you cause this might be our last night

'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you

What I'm telling you
I'm giving you my life, it's in your hands
And what I'm gonna do
Is be a woman and you can be a man
And I wanna say
Nobody understands what we've been through
I'd rather give up everything
Than to live my, live my life without you

'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you
'Cause I'd rather die young than live my life without you
I'd rather not live at all than live my life without you

// Start Over //

I feel weak, we've been here before
'Cause I feel we keep going back and forth
Maybe it's over, maybe we're through
But I honestly can say I still love you

Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find

Let's start over
Let's give love their wings
Let's start over
Stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over
We can't let our good love die

Maybe we can start all over
Give love another life

I can see that we're not happy here
So why would we keep pretending when there's nothing there
Maybe you like it, well I don't
Maybe you'll settle, well I won't

Maybe we reached the mountain peak
And there's no more left to climb
And maybe we lost the magic piece
And we're both too blind to find

Let's start over
Let's give love their wings
Let's start over
Stop fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over
We can't let our good love die

Maybe we can start all over
Give love another life

I know that this will hurt you
I know you'll cry
I know I called you selfish but that's a lie
I feel I know what's the best for us

Let's... start over!
And let's give love their wings
Let's start over
I'm tired of fighting about the same old thing
Let's start over
We both know that this love won't die

Maybe we can start all over
And give love another life

Honey, honey

Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away

Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
They say love hurts
But I know it's gonna take a little work
Nothing's perfect
But it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first

Baby, it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see

As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again

// Dreaming //

When I'm here in your arms, I feel love in my heart, I can breathe
Not even pinching myself, I don't care, I'm with you, you with me
I never wished on the star when the star ain't got nothing on me
'Cause I can wish you in my dreams

When I close my eyes, I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep, knowing that tonight you'll be here with me
Oh

(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Oh
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe (About you, babe)
So I'd rather be a dreamer than waking up with nobody home
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh)
If that's the only way to be with you, then dreaming you is where I belong
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

I think the luckiest girl in the whole wide world could be me
I get to be with the one that I love anytime I please
I feel like I can stay forever beyond eternity
It's like I'm where I'm supposed to be

When I close my eyes, I feel like I'm alive
'Cause I can fall asleep, knowing that tonight you'll be here with me
Oh

(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Oh
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe (About you, babe)
So I'd rather be a dreamer than waking up with nobody home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
If that's the only way to be with you, then dreaming you is where I belong
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

It took a lifetime just to get with you, to be with you, baby
And now that I'm here with you, I'm gonna take it in, breathe you in
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And if I am dreaming, let the dream be that I'm awake
'Cause I'd rather dream about you than living life without me and you, you

(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Oh
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe (About you, babe)
So I'd rather be a dreamer than waking up with nobody home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
If that's the only way to be with you, then dreaming you is where I belong
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
'Cause I ain't 'bout to be without you, babe (Without you, babe) Oh
(Let me know) If this is a dream
(Oh, oh, oh)
Then I ain't letting go (I ain't letting go)
'Cause everything I love is about you, babe (About you, babe)

// Lay Up Under Me //

Don't you worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

I was out shopping thinking of something I should get you
Cause I've been gone so many weeks, damn, I miss you
Don't wanna do nothing more than just stare at your face
And let you know I'm happy you're my best friend
Part of this fortune, boy, I owe you
For being always there to talk to
Take some time out, starting with today
For my babe

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight
And I'ma DJ all of your songs
You ain't got to worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight tonight, tonight
Tonight tonight, tonight
Don't you worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

Let's pop a bottle of the vintage that I bought you!
I'll model sexy pictures right on top of you
Ten years together, still feels like we're making love for the first time
Like I'm in high-school sneaking with my boyfriend
All of this fortune, boy, I owe you
For being always here to talk to
Taking time out, starting with today
For my babe

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight
And I'ma DJ all of your songs
You ain't got to worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight tonight, tonight
Tonight tonight, tonight
Don't you worry 'bout a club
Just come and lay up under me tonight

Boy, if you just call, I'm on my way
When it comes to my baby, I bring my best
I just wanna party tonight
'Cause it's obvious to see that you're all I wanna be
Uh, just let me look at you!
Uh, you look so sexy boy, I wanna taste!
All unwrapped and on its way
When I groove with you
Oh, you'll feel so good boy you're my favorite place
Just come and lay up under me!

We're gonna hit the floor at home
We'll let the candles be your light tonight
And I'ma DJ all of your songs

// Schoolin' Life //

This is for them 20-somethings
Time really moves fast, you were just sixteen
This is for them 30-somethings
That didn't turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be
This is for them 40-somethings
Well, raise up your glass and laugh like a motherfucker
This is for them 50-somethings
Hell, you're halfway there, baby, take it to the head

Mom and Dad tried to hide the world
Said the world's just too big for a little girl
Eyes wide open, can't you see?
I had my first heels by the age of 13
Mom and Dad tried to hide the boys
I swear that just made 'em want me more
At 14, they asked me what I wanna be
I said, "Baby, 21, so I get me a drink"

I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight, boy I'm out of sight
And I'm crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh (Schoolin' life)
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh (Schoolin' life)

This is for them pretty somethings
Living in the fast lane, see you when you crash, babe
This is for them sexy somethings
That body ain't gon' always get you out of everything
This is for them bitter somethings
Stop living in regret, baby, it's not over yet
And this is for them chipper somethings
That's high on life, baby, put me on your flight

I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight, boy I'm out of sight
And I'm crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh (Schoolin' life)
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh (Schoolin' life)

You know it costs to be the boss
One day you'll run the town
For now make your life what you decide
Baby, party 'til the fire marshals shut this sucks down

I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I'm great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight, boy I'm out of sight
And I'm crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
(Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?) Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
(Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?) Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

There's not a real way to live this, for real
Just remember to stay relentless
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't stop running until it's finished
Yeah, yeah
It's up to you, the rest is unwritten
Hey, hey, hey

'Cause I can recognize that you know that
That's why I'm backing this thing back
Pop-popping this thing back
Drop, drop, drop-dropping this thing back
This is for the time you gave me flowers
For the world that is ours
For the mula, for the power of love
And no I won't never ever e-ever give you up
And I wanna say thank you in case I don't thank you enough
A woman in the street and a freak in the you know what
Sit back, sit back, it's the pre-game show
Daddy, you know what's up

Loving you is really all that's on my mind
And I can't help but to think about it day and night
I wanna make that body rock
Sit back and watch

'Cause it's about to go down

I'm a take this time to show you how much you mean to me
'Cause you are all I need
No money can emphasize
Or describe
The love that's in-between the lines
Boy look into my eyes
While I'm grinding on you
This is beyond sex
I'm high on you
If it's real then you know how I feel
Rocking on you, babe, rocking, rocking on you, babe
Swirling on you, babe
In my mind all I can think about is a frame for our future
And the pictures of the past and a chance to make this love last

Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna dance for you, oh
Tonight I'm gonna put my body on your body
Boy I like it when you watch me, ah

Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it for you, baby
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch me roll it, baby
