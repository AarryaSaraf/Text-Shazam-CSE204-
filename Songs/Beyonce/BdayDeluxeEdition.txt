// Déjà Vu //

Bass (Uh)
Hi-hat (Uh)
808 (Uh)
Jay (uh-huh, ready, uh-huh)
Let's go get 'em (Uh-huh)
C'mon (C'mon)

I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B. (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B., she about to sting, stand back

Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu

Seeing, things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkin' past me almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losing it

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu

Yes, Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro
'Cause you gonna need help tryna study my, bounce
Flow, blow, what's the difference?
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dope, po-po try to convict him
That's a no-go, my dough keep the scales tippin'
Like 4-4s, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one of one, nothin' after me
No déjà vu, just me and my (oh!)

Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having déjà vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having déjà vu?

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's déjà vu

Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo
It's very seldom that you're blessed to find your equals
Still play my part and let you take the lead role, believe me

I'll be the help, whenever you need me (You need me)

They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz oughta do
It's big balling, baby, when I'm courting you
I'm talking spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on ya finger's like a tumor
You can't fit ya hand in ya new purse
It's humorous to me, they're watching and we just yachting
Island-hopping off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You're sure to see stars, this is high level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (Hehe)

Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevating with me
Now you my project celebrity
I keep ya name hot in them streets
That little glimpse of light
Makes that diamond really shine
And you already is a star, but unless you're flawless
Then ya dynasty ain't complete without a chief, like me

Partner, partner, let me upgrade ya, grade ya
Let me, let me, let me upgrade ya, grade ya
Partner, partner, partner, let me upgrade ya (Huh!)

// Ring The Alarm //

Ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gon' rock them VVS stones
If I let you go
Couped in the 'bach or the Rolls
If I let you go
She gon' profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gon' choke?

You can't stay, you gotta go, oh
Ain't no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture-perfect movie everyone would've saw

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go

I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

He's so arrogant and bold, oh
But she gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call
Partner, ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'ma cause

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go

If I let you go
Couped in the 'bach or the Rolls

She gon' profit everything I taught
If I let you go

Damned if I let you go

How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, babe?
Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?
(See all the things, see all the things)

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go

And, it's my name that's on that Jag
So remove your bags, let me call you a cab

Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought, that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
'Cause you was untrue
Rollin' her 'round in the car that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standing in the front yard
Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I will have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable (Irreplaceable)

So since I'm not your everything (Irreplaceable)
How about I'll be nothing (Nothing)
Nothing at all to you (Nothing)
Baby, I won't shed a tear for you (I won't shed a tear)
I won't lose a wink of sleep
'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you was so easy

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Mm
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You must not know 'bout me (Baby, yeah)
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute
You can pack all your bags, we're finished
(You must not know 'bout me)
'Cause you made your bed, now lay in it
(You must not know 'bout me)
I can have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable

// Resentment //

I wish I could believe you, then I'd be alright
But now everything you told me really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Lovin' you was easy once upon a time
But now my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

Just can't seem to get over the way you hurt me
Don't know how you gave another who didn't mean a thing (Mean a thing), no
The very thing you gave to me
I thought I could forgive you, and I know you've changed
As much as I wanna trust you, I know it ain't the same (It ain't the same)
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time (Hard time)
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this (Forget this)
But I'm much too full of resentment (I'm much too full of resentment)
I may never understand why
I'm doin' the best that I can, and I
I tried and I tried to forget this (Forget this)
But I'm much too full of resentment

(You lied) I'll always remember feelin' (You lied)
Like I was no good (You lied)
Like I couldn't do it for you (You lied)
Like your mistress could
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than another (You lied)
More than my own life (You lied)
But that part of me I gave you (You lied)
It was sacrificed (Sacrificed)
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like (I can't go on and pretend like)
I tried and I tried to forget this (I tried and I tried and I tried)
But I'm too damn full of resentment

I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been ridin' with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you?
I know you're probably thinkin', "What's up with B?"
I been cryin' for too long, what did you do to me?
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm cryin', can't stop cryin', can't stop cryin'
You could've told me you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes (You lied)
(You lied) And see she's had half of me (You lied)
How could you lie? (You lied)

// Listen //

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete

Listen to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release

Oh, the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own
All 'cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own

You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago

Oh, I'm screaming out, and my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worse
Into your own
All 'cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried
To say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't
If you won't

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start
But I will complete

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you've made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own
My own

// Beautiful Liar //

Nobody likes being played

Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Shakira, Shakira

He said I'm worth it, his one desire
I know things about him that you wouldn't wanna read about
He kissed me, his one and only (yes), beautiful liar
Tell me how you tolerate the things that you just found out about

You never know
Why are we the ones who suffer
I have to let go
He won't be the one to cry

Let's not kill the karma
Let's not start a fight
It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar

Can't we laugh about it
It's not worth our time
We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

I trusted him, but when I followed you, I saw you together
I didn't know about you then 'til I saw you with him again
I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing
You stole everything, how can you say I did you wrong

We'll never know
When the pain and heartbreak's over
I have to let go
The innocence is gone

Let's not kill the karma
Let's not start a fight
It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar

Can't we laugh about it
It's not worth our time
We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

Tell me how to forgive you
When it's me who's ashamed
And I wish I could free you
Of the hurt and the pain
But the answer is simple
He's the one to blame

Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Shakira, Shakira
Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Shakira, Shakira

Let's not kill the karma
Let's not start a fight
It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar

Can't we laugh about it
It's not worth our time
We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

Hollywood, welcome to Hollywood

// Flaws And All //

I'm a train wreck in the morning
I'm a bitch in the afternoon
Every now and then without warning
I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle, yes, indeed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention, I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes, I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And that's exactly what I mean

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you, you, you

// If //

He's always laughing
And flirting with me
And you act like you don't even care
As a matter of fact
You've been real distant lately
Acting like I'm not even there
He says that you
Don't deserve a girl like me
I'm starting to think that he's right
Baby

If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (Baby)
If you let him take me from you

Why is that when we go out
Out together as one big crew
I try to chill with you
Dance or whatever
And your homeboy's more interested than you?
He pays more attention to me than you lately
I'm tempted to pay attention too
Baby

If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves
That your love was never true
If you let him take me from you (Baby)
If you let him take me from you

Boy, when I try to show some affection to you
You act like you got better things to do
When you want some loving
That's when its cool
But baby boy, I'm not a fool

If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me (Wanted me)
Let this happen and it proves (No, no)
That your love was never true (No, no)
If you let him take me from you
(How could you let him take your woman?)
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you
I guess I finally see
If you let him take me from you
You never wanted me
Let this happen and it proves (Just let me go)
That your love was never true (Let me go)
If you let him take me from you (Just let me know)
If you let him take me from you
If you let him take me from you

// Still In Love (Kissing You) //

I'm so in love
I'm still in love
I never met love quite before
Until I saw your face
And watching stars without you
My soul cries
My heaving heart
Is full of pain
When we're apart
The aching

I'm kissing you
Oh
I'm kissing you, oh

You're my father, you're my soldier
You protect me
Boy you saved me
You're best friend
You're my husband
You are my doctor, counselor, provider, professor, my everything
And I love you, I love you, I love you, yes, I love you

I, I need you, I need you, I need you
I can't live without you
I trust you, I trust you with every ounce of me
Just teach me boy teach me just take me
When we make love I can feel all your spirits
Deep inside of me yea
Baby you're so pure, oh

I'm kissing you forever and ever and ever
I love kissing you, kissing you, kissing you
I love everything about you, baby
It's been so many years since we found love
You got something special, baby

We can cry together
We can grow together
Be ourselves together
And I love you
More than music
Yes, I love you more than music

I rather be kissing you, oh
I'm kissing you, oh
Kissing you
Kissing you

// Amor Gitano //

Ven y quédate conmigo
Dame el corazón vida mía estoy muriendo lento en mi prisión
Anda dime lo que sientes quitate el pudor
Y deja de sufrir, escapa con mi amor
Y después te llevare hasta donde quieras sin temor
Y sin fronteras hasta donde sale el sol
Contigo soy capaz de lo que sea
No me importa lo que venga
Porque ya se a donde voy

Soy tu gitano, tu peregrino
La única llave de tu destino
El que te cuida más que a su vida
Soy tu ladrón
Soy tu gitana, tu compañera
La que te sigue, la que te espera
Voy a quererte aunque me saquen el corazón
Y aunque nos cueste la vida

Y aunque duela lo que duela

Esta guerra la ha ganado nuestro amor

Esta guerra la ha ganado nuestro amor

Yo nací para tus ojos, para nadie más
Siempre voy a estar en tu camino
Alma de mi alma, corazón de tempestad
Dime por donde ir
Y después te llevare hasta donde quiera
Sin temor y sin fronteras hasta donde sale el sol
Contigo soy capaz de lo que sea
No me importa lo que venga porque ya se a donde voy

Soy tu gitano, tu peregrino
La única llave de tu destino
El que te cuida más que a su vida
Soy tu ladrón
Soy tu gitana, tu compañera
La que te sigue, la que te espera
Voy a quererte aunque me saquen el corazón
Y aunque nos cueste la vida
Y aunque duela lo que duela
Esta guerra la ha ganado nuestro amor
Y aunque nos cueste la vida
Y aunque duela lo que duela
Esta guerra la ha ganado

Nuestro amor

// Oye //

Oye, lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir viviendo así
Oye (uhum) como llora mi canción
Preciso tu atención, debes oir

Hoy no se quien soy ni se adonde voy
Encontrarme hoy es mi misión
De tu prisón por fin ya soy libre

Oye
Esto no tiene salida
Ya nada sirve que digas
Tengo que escapar
Yo tengo que escuchar a mi corazón
Hoy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor voy a partir
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz

Nunca quisiste que me fuera a volar
Callar mi identidad, que gran error

Hoy grito no tengo más temor
Hoy tu alumna te dice adiós
De tu prisión por fin ya soy libre

Oye
Esto no tiene salida
Ya nada sirve que digas
Tengo que escapar
Yo tengo que escuchar a mi corazón
Hoy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor voy a partir
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz

Yo soy tu gran creación
Por eso es que me voy
Dime adiós, dime adiós

Oye
Lo que tengo que decir
No puedo ya seguir viviendo asi
Ya me voy
Buscaré mi propia luz
No seas insensible
Soy más de lo que fui por ti
Llena de valor hoy me ire sin ti
Yo tengo que encontrar mi voz
Mi voz!

// Irreemplazable //

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
En el closet, en un rincón están tus cosas
Esto se acabó (se acabó)

Te juro que no te aguanto más
No te quiero ya ni como amante
Esta vez no ganarás
Te puedes marchar y no vuelvas jamás

Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
A olvidar tu amor

Ya me curé del dolor
Ya te saqué de mi corazón
Vete con ella, solos los dos
Pobre de ti, lárgate me das asco

Tú eras mi luz, pero hay amores que matan de daño
Me cansé de ti
Ya no soy aquella infeliz

Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor (voy a olvidar tu amor...)

Ya no soy nada para ti (voy a olvidar tu amor...)
Alguien que no conoces (conoces...)
Lo nuestro se acabó (se acabó...)
Tanto daño al fin lo destruyó (destruyó...)
Nunca lloraré por ti (lloraré por ti)
Porque ya me cansé de ti (ya me cansé de ti)
No eres más imprescindible

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Hum
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte

¿Qué sabes tú de mí? (baby...)
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme

(¿Qué sabes tú de mí?)
No hay más que hablar, terminamos
(No me hagas reír)
Este cuento al fin se ha acabado
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor

Miente, lo ves

Sabe decir lo que
Quieres oír
Un bello embustero
(Solo por placer nuestra amistad no vamos a perder)

A mí también
Siempre quiere verme sola
No hay que caer
En su trampa una vez más

No nos pelearemos
No nos va a engañar
No terminaremos
Por un bello embustero
¿Nos va dividir? ¡No!
No nos va a excitar
¿Vamos a sufrir?
Por un bello embustero

Confiaba en él
Mas cuando lo que encontré
Besándote el cuello
(Pero él no lo podía creer las dos caímos en su red)
¿Por qué a ti?
Si hay mil por ahí
Él es un perro
(Las dos sin querer caímos presas en su piel)

A mí también
Siempre quiere verme sola
No hay que caer
En su trampa una vez más

No nos pelearemos
No nos va a engañar
No terminaremos
Por un bello embustero
¿Nos va dividir? ¡No!
No nos va a excitar
¿Vamos a sufrir?
Por un bello embustero

Lo creía tan mío
Yo vivía por él
Fuimos un desafío
Que pudo más que él
Es un hombre muy frío
No es de una mujer
Ya no nos puede engañar
Haremos con su juego, ya basta... de sus mentiras
Dile adiós por las dos

No nos pelearemos
No nos va a engañar
No terminaremos
Por un bello embustero
¿Nos va dividir? ¡No!
No nos va a excitar
¿Vamos a sufrir?
Por un bello embustero

(Ay) It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
(Oh) Nos va dividir?
(Oh) No nos va a excitar
(Oh) Vamos a sufrir?
(Oh) Por un bello embustero

// Irreemplazable (Nortena Remix) //

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
En el closet, en un rincón están tus cosas
Esto se acabó (se acabó)

Te juro que no te aguanto más
No te quiero ya ni como amante
Esta vez no ganarás
Te puedes marchar y no vuelvas jamás

Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
A olvidar tu amor

Ya me curé del dolor
Ya te saqué de mi corazón
Vete con ella, solos los dos
Pobre de ti, lárgate me das asco

Tú eras mi luz, pero hay amores que matan de daño
Me cansé de ti
Ya no soy aquella infeliz

Y si acaso piensas que esta vez voy a perdonar
Ya verás que nunca más me vuelves a engañar
Ya lárgate

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor (voy a olvidar tu amor)

Ya no soy nada para ti (voy a olvidar tu amor)
Alguien que no conoces (conoces)
Lo nuestro se acabó (se acabó)
Tanto daño al fin lo destruyó (destruyó)
Nunca lloraré por ti (lloraré por ti)
Porque ya me cansé de ti (ya me cansé de ti)
No eres más imprescindible

Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Hum
Ya lo ves, ya lo ves
Ya lo ves amor esta vez te olvidé
Te olvidé, te olvidé
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme, baby

¿Qué sabes tú de mí?
No me hagas reír
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte

¿Qué sabes tú de mí? (baby)
No me hagas reír
Tú creías que eras imprescindible
Pero sin tu amor no voy a morirme

(¿Qué sabes tú de mí?)
No hay más que hablar, terminamos
(No me hagas reír)
Este cuento al fin se ha acabado
Me verás con otro hombre a mi lado
Ya lo ves traidor voy a sustituirte
Voy a olvidar tu amor
