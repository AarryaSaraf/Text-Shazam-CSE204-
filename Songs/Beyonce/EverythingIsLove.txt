Hopped out the Lam' with the sheep
Skin rugs on the floor

We tried to hide in the hills
We watched the sky turn peach
Summer's light like, summer's night
It's like, Christ masterpiece
She taste like Corona Light, sweet
Even the lime gotta squeeze
She gave me a little swig, to chase behind my weed
If I can stay in her hair forever, that'd be fine by me
I don't have no concept of time
Even with a rose gold Concept on me
I remember summer nights in the projects
Bullet rounds interrupting my Chi
When the worst thing that could happen
Zipped up his jacket and ran back down the street
In Bel-Air, only the nights get cold
I wrapped a yellow jacket 'round Bey
It's not lost on me, music has my kids sound asleep

Oh, let's make love in the summertime, yeah
On the sands, beach sands, make plans
To be in each other's arms, yeah
Let it breathe, let it breathe

Still dippin' in my low-lows, girl! (still)

Confidence you exude make the fools stay away
Me, I played my room, let the fools have they say
Fate had me sittin' next to you on the plane
And I knew straight away, uh
The next time we would speak was like two years away
You had a man, you shut it down until you two had a break

You kept me up on the phone while you were away
You came back, I let you set the date
Nobu on the plate
I brought my dude to play it cool, my first foolish mistake, aye

Meanwhile you goin' hard, jumpin' off the top deck
A leap of faith, I knew I was up next
I never told you, but I told a few people we wed
Me, I'm off to Rome, you goin' back home instead
My first time in my life a live nigga felt dead
You came back, I had to act like it was cool in my head
Thoughts of jumpin' the broom, a player never been swept

Hmm, well there's love of children
Love of self
Love of God
Love of a partner
All of them have a different shape
But all of them is the same in the end
It's about sensitivity, it's about passion
It's about unconditional giving of self to another person
And there's love of humanity
That's the love that is right now needed most
Love of humanity
But in everything, in all of that love, there is a soul
It's like when you take some eggs and break them
And you take the shells and mix them up
Trying to find the ones that match
And you find the perfect match
When you find the perfect match
That compatibility results in passion
Results in unconditional giving of self
I hope I can say that again

I'm good on any MLK Boulevard
I'm good on any MLK Boulevard
See my vision with a tech, bitch, I'm Malcolm X
Haters dreadin' my effect, they want that Das EFX
Get your hands up high like a false arrest
Let me see 'em up high, this is not a test
Yes, put 'em up, this is not a test
Now hands where I can see them, fuck a false arrest

This Off-White fit that I rock, shit permanent
Hmm, the fro that I grow got no perm in it
Hmm, a nigga late but he best dressed
Got slowed down by the weight of my necklaces
Parked the Lexus in the projects, bitch I'm reckless
Extra magazine hopped on a jet with my Ebony chick
Blacker than the Essence fest
The behind the back pass is so effortless
LeBron James to you Omaroses
Dapper Dan at 4 AM, shit, I am the culture
I made my own waves so now they're anti-Tidal
I'm livin' the no sock life to spite you
Since the Kalief doc, they've been at my neck
Y'all can tell 'em Trayvon is comin' next
The SEC, the FBI or the IRS
I pass the alphabet boys like an eye test

I'm good on any MLK Boulevard (I'm good)
I'm good on any MLK Boulevard (He good)
See my vision with a tech, bitch, I'm Malcolm X (I'm Malcolm X)
Haters dreadin' my effect, they want that Das EFX (Yeah)
Get your hands up high like a false arrest (put your hands up high)
Let me see 'em up high, this is not a test (let me see 'em up high)
Yes, put 'em up, this is not a test
Put your hands where I can see them, fuck a false arrest

Higher, higher
Higher, higher
Higher, higher
Higher, higher
Higher

I'm good anywhere I go, anywhere I go (go)
I pull up like the Freedom Riders, hop out on Rodeo
Stunt with your curls, your lips, Sarah Baartman hips
Gotta hop into my jeans like I hop into my whip yeah
Mobbin' in a hoodie like Melo
Come up out that pretty motherfucker like "Hello, Hello"
I will never let you shoot the nose off my Pharaoh
I like purple and purple rain
Tryin' to put red and blue together, bitch, that's on gang
These people tryna get me out the paint
'Cause I cook collard greens and yams better than your aunt
Man, we started with a mustard seed
Now we in the gray 911 with the mustard seats
Sheesh! Matte black puma jet
Shining my light on the world just like "UMI Says"
Got the Richard Mille all colors
Might hit you with the Rose Gold all summer
For the culture
They even biting cornrows, put your scarecrows up
I come from the finest crop
Tell em the god's on row, watch them line the block
The Chitlin' circuit is stopped
Now we in stadiums, Eighty Thou a wop, Watch

I'm good on any MLK Boulevard (He good)
I'm good on any MLK Boulevard (We good)
See my vision with a TEC, bitch, I'm Malcolm X (I'm Malcom X)
Haters dreadin' my effect, they want that Das EFX (Yeah)
Get your hands up high like a false arrest
(Get your hands up high like a false arrest)
Let me see 'em up high, this is not a test
(Let me see 'em up high, this is not a test)
Yes, put 'em up, this is not a test
(Yes, put em up, this is not a test)
Now hands where I can see them, fuck a false arrest

I know I've only come half the way
But looking in the mirror I see an older me
Not realizing all the years that passed away
But I know I've only come half my way

// Lovehappy //

Happily in love, haters please forgive me
I let my wife write the will, I pray my children outlive me
I give my daughter my custom dresses, she gon' be litty
Vintage pieces by the time she hit the city, yeah-ah
Vintage frames, I see nobody fuckin' wit' him
Pretty thug, out the third ward, hit me
Sir acts just like his dad, shit is trippy (uh-huh)
Twinning, Blue and Rumi, me and Solo how fitting
(Happy in love)
Sitting, dock of the bay wit' a big yacht
Sippin' Yamazaki on the rocks
He went to Jared, I went to JAR out in Paris
Yeah, you fucked up the first stone, we had to get remarried
Yo, chill man! We keepin' it real with these people, right?
Lucky I ain't kill you when I met that b- (Nah, aight, aight)
Y'all know how I met her, we broke up and got back together
To get her back, I had to sweat her
Y'all could make up with a bag, I had to change the weather (uh)
Move the whole family West, but it's whatever
In a glass house still throwing stones
Hova, Beysus, watch the thrones
(Happy in love)

You did some things to me
Boy, you do some things to me
But love is deeper than your pain
And I believe you can change, baby
The ups and downs are worth it
Long way to go, but we're workin'
We're flawed, but we're still perfect for each other, baby, you
Sometimes, I thought we'd never see the light
We went through hell with heaven on our side
This beach ain't always been no paradise
But nightmares only last one night
(Happy in love)

No more clubs and Cali-curfews (one night)
Just private affairs in a tighter circle
Large format wines in small settings, woo
Just hood ass niggas in designer suits (ooh)
Follow my moves on a truth in AlaÃ¯a boots, yeah, yeah
Amelia Earhart, flyer than who? (yeah, yeah)
Fake news y'all choose, we no lie
No Photoshop, just real life
(Happy in love)

You did some things to me
Boy, you do some things to me
But love is deeper than your pain
And I believe you can change, baby
The ups and downs are worth it
Long way to go, but we're workin'
We're flawed, but we're still perfect for each other, baby, you
Sometimes, I thought we'd never see the light
We went through hell with heaven on our side
This beach ain't always been no paradise
But nightmares only last one night
(Happy in love)

Damn, look at us now
Pray, pray for the vows
Way up now, it's a long way, a long way down
We came, and we saw, and we conquered it all
We came, and we conquered, now we're happy in love
(Lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy)
(Lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy)
(Lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy)
(Lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy, lovehappy)
