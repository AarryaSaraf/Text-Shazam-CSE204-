// If I Were A Boy //

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home (to come home)

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand
Yeah, you don't understand, oh
How it feels to love a girl someday
You wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

But you're just a boy

// Disappear //

If I begged and if I cried
Would it change the sky tonight?
Would it give me some light?
Should I wait for you to call?
Is there any hope at all?
Are you drifting by?

When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)

And when I lie all by myself
I see your face, I hear your voice
My heart stays faithful
And time has come and time has passed
If it's good, it's got to last
It feels so right

When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You disappear (Disappear, disappear, disappear)
You, you disappear
(Disappear, disappear, disappear)

I missed all the signs, one at a time
You were ready
What did I know?
Starting our lives
Now my love, I'm ready to show

When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear
You disappear, you disappear
You disappear, disappear

// Broken-Hearted Girl //

You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still, you live inside of me
So tell me how is that?
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart, you're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
'Cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl

Something that I feel I need to say
But up to now, I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you've got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one
And yes, there are times when I hate you
But I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you
I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl

Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't gotta be afraid my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away
Away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh

I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't wanna a broken heart
Don't want to take a breath without my baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
Broken-hearted girl no, no
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl

// Ave Maria //

She was lost in so many different ways
Out in the darkness with no guide
I know the cost of a losing hand
There for the grace of God go, I

I found Heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria

I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends
How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down

You are my Heaven on earth
You are my hunger, my thirst
I always hear this voice inside
Singing Ave Maria

Sometimes love can come and pass you by
While you're busy making plans
Suddenly hit you and then you realize
It's out of your hands, baby, you got to understand

You are my Heaven on earth
You are my last, my first
And then I hear this voice inside
Ave Maria
Ave Maria
Ave Maria

// Smash Into You //

Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I find myself in love racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love
And love was right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

I wanna run (Run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (Run)
And smash into you

Ears closed
What I hear, no one else has to know
'Cause I know
That what we have is worth first place in gold
And I'm soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong, oh

I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
I wanna run (run)
Smash into you
Smash into you
Oh

Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I'm in love and I'm racing the Earth
And I'm soaked in your love (Your love)
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And me and you belong

Oh, I wanna run
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (Run)
Smash into you
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm willing to run, run, run, run, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I wanna run (Run)
Smash into you
I'm willing to run (Run)
Smash into you

// Satellites //

Satellites flashing by
It's a beautiful state we're in
But how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try
We're nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You don't know how I bleed
When I leave your side

In your eyes, love's alive
You've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

Take all the rules away
How can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display
Let's run and hide

In our eyes, love's alive
We've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites
Satellites

If we don't communicate
We'll exist in our own space
We have all the love we need
While we're apart, I cannot breathe

Satellites flashing by
Satellites

// That's Why You're Beautiful //

Diamonds used to be coal
Look young 'cause they got soul
That's why they're beautiful
And my heart used to be cold
'Til your hands laid on my soul, baby
And that's why you're beautiful

I'm not wondering why
The sky's blue. That's not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love. That could be us."

Lovers used to make love
And died just to give us
Their piece of the beautiful
Remember when we made love?
Love
Wasn't it beautiful?

Don't ask me why
The sky's blue. That's not my business
All I know is I
Look up and tell myself
"Be patient, love. That could be us."

Diamonds used to be coal (Be coal)
Look young 'cause they got soul (got soul)
And my heart used to be cold (be cold)
'Til your hands laid on my soul
Somebody's got to stay deep in love
That could be you

That's why we're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful

Why, why?

That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful
That's why you're beautiful

// Save The Hero //

I lay alone awake at night
Sorrow fills my eyes
But I'm not strong enough to cry
Despite of my disguise
I'm left with no shoulder
But everybody wants to lean on me
I guess I'm their soldier
Well, who's gonna be mine?

Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help?
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world
After she saves the world?

I bottle all my hurt inside
I guess I'm living a lie
Inside my mind each day I die
What can bring me back to life?
A simple word, a gesture
Someone to say you're beautiful
Come find this buried treasure
Rainbows lead to a pot of gold

Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help?
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world (After she saves the world)
After she saves the world? (After she saves the world)
(After she saves the world)

I've given too much of myself and now it's driving me crazy
(I'm crying out for help)
Sometimes I wish someone would just come here and save me
Save me from myself

Who's there to save the hero
When she's left all alone
And she's crying out for help?
Who's there to save the hero?
Who's there to save the girl
After she saves the world (After she saves the world)
After she saves the world? (After she saves the world)
(After she saves the world)

(After she saves the world)
After she saves the world

// Si Yo Fuera Un Chico //

Si yo fuera un chico
SÃ³lo por una vez
Yo me vestirÃ­a como quiero
Con lo que vea primero y me voy
SaldrÃ­a a buscar
Chicas por montÃ³n
Mis amigos que son leales
Siempre van a acompaÃ±arme hasta el fin
Cada noche a mentir

Si yo fuera un chico
SÃ© que podrÃ­a saber
Comprender mucho mejor
Lo que es amar a una mujer
SabrÃ­a escuchar
Pues conozco el dolor
De perder a quien se quiere
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber que pasÃ³

Si yo fuera un chico
Pero ves no lo soy
Los chicos son de un molde
Y nosotras somos de corazÃ³n
Se piensan que son
Los del sexo superior
Pero cuando lo queremos
Nos vence nuestra seducciÃ³n

Si yo fuera un chico
SÃ© que podrÃ­a saber
Comprender mucho mejor
Lo que es amar a una mujer
SabrÃ­a escuchar
Pues conozco el dolor
De perder a quien se quiere
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber que pasÃ³

Es muy tarde ya ves para regresar
Perdonarte otra vez ya no lo vas a lograr
El lugar que ocupabas tÃº, ya no estÃ¡ mÃ¡s

Pero eres un chico
Que le vas a hacer
No puedes comprender
Que se siente al comprender mejor
Y amar en serio a una mujer
No sabes escuchar
No te importa el dolor
Hasta que pierdes a quien quieres
Porque ignoras lo que tienes
Y quedas sin saber que pasÃ³

Pero eres un chico

With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don't wanna wake up from you

Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

Clouds filled with stars cover the skies (Cover the skies)

// Ego //

Aw baby, how you doin'?
You know I'm gonna cut right to the chase, huh?
Some women were made
But me, myself?
I like to think that I was created
For a special purpose
And, uh
What's more special than you?
You feel me?

It's on, baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call in to work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why?
Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it
I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

It's too big (Big)
It's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong)
It won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much)
It's too tough (Tough)
He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego
I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

Usually I'm humble
Right now, I don't choose
You can leave with me
Or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant
I call it confident
You decide when you find out what I'm working with
Damn, I know
I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet, them thighs
Matter of fact it's my smile, or maybe my eyes?
Boy, you a sight to see
Kinda something like me

It's too big (Big)
It's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong)
It won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much)
It's too tough (Tough)
I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I got a big ego
Such a huge ego
But he loves my big ego
It's too much
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

I, I walk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
I, I, I can back it up
I can back it up
I walk like this 'cause I can back it up

It's too big (Big)
It's too wide (Wide)
It's too strong (Strong)
It won't fit (Fit)
It's too much (Much)

He talk like this 'cause he can back it up
He got a big ego
Such a huge ego (Such a huge ego)
But I love his big ego
It's too much
He walk like this 'cause he can back it up

Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, you ain't know?
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano
Whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa, woo

Oh, oh-oh-oh

// Scared Of Lonely //

I'm in this fight and I'm swingin', and my arms are getting tired
I'm tryna beat this emptiness, but I'm runnin' out of time
I'm sinkin' in the sand and I can barely stand
I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me
I'm scared of lonely
I try to be patient, but I'm hurtin' deep inside
And I can't keep waitin', I need comfort late at night
And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home?
'Cause I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely

I cry at night, 'cause my baby's too far to be by my side
To wipe away these tears of mine, so I hold my pillow tight
To imagine you outstretch your hand, looking for mine
'Cause I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

I need your strength when nobody is around
'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness, I think I'm drowning
I can't be lonely no more
And I'm lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
And I'm scared of being the only
Shadow I see along the wall
And I'm scared the only heartbeat
I hear beating is my own
And I'm scared of being alone
I can't seem to breathe when I am lost in this dream
I need you to hold me

I'm scared of lonely
I'm scared of lonely

// Why Don't You Love Me? //

Now, now, now, honey
You better sit down and look around
'Cause you must've bumped your head
And I love you enough to talk some sense back into you, baby
I'd hate to see you come home, me the kids
And the dog is gone
Check my credentials
I give you everything you want everything you need
Even your friends say I'm a good woman
All I need to know is why?

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
And why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

I got beauty, I got class
I got style, and I got ass
And you don't even care to care
Look here
I even put money in the bank account
Don't have to ask no one to help me out
You don't even notice that

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

I got beauty, I got heart
Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp
But you don't care to know I'm smart
Now, now now now now now now
I got moves in your bedroom
Keep you happy with the nasty things I do
But you don't seem to be in tune
Ooh

Why don't you love me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you love me
When I make me so damn easy to love?
Why don't you need me?
Tell me, baby, why don't you need me
When I make me so damn easy to need?

There's nothing not to love about me
No, no, there's nothing not to love about me
I'm lovely
There's nothing not to need about me
No, no, there's nothing not to need about me
Maybe you're just not the one
Or maybe you're just plain

Dumb, dumb, dumb
