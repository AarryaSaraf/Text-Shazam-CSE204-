I love how you approach me
Fresh white, with your pants, hanging grown man low
Everything you sayin' soundin' good to me
No need to convince me anymore
Swagger, it's right, one blade is tight
And I smell your cologne in the air
Baby, you doin' somethin' right
You just cancelled every other man here
You say you love my bag, and the color of my nails
You can see that I got it goin' on
I wanna make sure you remember me
So I'm gon' leave my number on your video phone

I know just what I'm wantin'
If it's gonna be you and me
When I call, they better see me on your video screen

They like the way I'm walkin'
You saying that you want me?

// Poison //

You're bad for me
I clearly get it
I don't see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
'Cause with every hug and kiss, you're snatching every bit of strength
That I'm gon' need to fight off the inevitable
And it's a heart-breakin' situation I'm up in, but I can't control

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

You ain't right, take me high
Then that high, it subsides
And my body flat-lines
Then you come to revive
Wait, wait, wait, I'm alive
But how long will it last?
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What's the prognosis, will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down?

Baby, you're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

It's just not my body (no)
It's my mind
You don't know how many times I told myself this can't do
And that I don't need you (no, I don't need you, no)
It's so unfair
That I find myself right back in your care
And what's good is that when you're not always there
(There, there)
You're no good for my health, my health

You're just like poison (whoa, whoa, whoa)
You're just like poison (whoa, whoa, whoa)

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, but I do
You're just like poison
My affliction, I'm addicted, I can't lie
Baby, kiss me one more time

You're just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You're just like poison and I just don't get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I'm not sure of what to do
It's a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don't want it, do
You're just like poison
I'm addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

// Honesty //

If you search for tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give

Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe

Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me with promises again
I know
I know

When I'm deep inside of me
Don't be too concerned
I won't ask for nothin'
While I'm gone
But when I want sincerity
Tell me, where else can I turn?
Because you're the one that I depend upon

Honesty
Is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty
Is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you
