// Summertime //

Out of all the guys that approach me
Walking up to me like they know me
You were the one that stayed aside
Waited a while and took your time
You don't know how impressing
Your curiosity was to me
It was the 4th day of July
Looked in my eyes and saw that I

I wanted more than just a man
I needed a friend
Someone I can talk to someone who really listens
When you touched my hand the sun got brighter then
Trusting you I closed my eyes and felt our love begin

It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby there is nothing like the summertime
Summertime

Now it's been a year and were closer
Fall in love again when I hold ya
I know that God set you aside for me
And now you are my prize
Wanna grow old with you
And fill our house with your pictures
Have a son for you
A little girl for me
Together we'll raise a family

Baby you're more than just a man
You are my best friend
Someone I can talk to someone who really listens
When you touched my hand the sun got brighter then
Trusting you I closed my eyes and felt our love begin

It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby there is nothing like the summertime
Summertime

It was the summertime
When we fell in love it was the summertime
Heaven shined on us it was the summertime
Baby there is nothing like the summertime
Summertime

// Halo //

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out

'Cause everywhere we looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Haiti, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over your face
Haiti, we can feel your halo
I pray it won't fade away

Halo
I can see your halo
I can see your halo
I can see your halo

You hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breaking
The risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere we looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Haiti, we can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over your face
Haiti, we can see your halo
I pray it won't fade away

Your halo
I can see your halo
I can see your halo
I can see your halo
Your halo
I can feel your halo
I can see your halo
I can see your halo

Yeah, everywhere we looking now
Surrounded by your embrace
Haiti, we can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything we need and more
It's written all over your face
Haiti, we can feel your halo
I pray it won't fade away
