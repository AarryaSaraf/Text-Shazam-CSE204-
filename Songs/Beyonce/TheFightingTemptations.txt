// Rain Down //

There's a storm within
And I don't want to let it end
I'll give you all control and
Let your love rain down on me

In my heart and mind
Is your love divine
I'm gonna let it flow
And let your love rain down on me

Gonna raise my hands and dance
Gonna give Him all I can
Everytime I call His name
His love rains down on me
Gonna lift my voice and sing
Of the love and joy He brings
Everytime I praise His name
His love rains down on me

When I was in distress
I needed happiness (Come on)
So I got down on my knees
And asked you to comfort me

I know that thunder brings the rain
So I called your Holy name
And you washed away my sins
Gave me new life again

Gonna raise my hands and dance
Gonna give Him all I can
Everytime I call His name
His love rains down on me
Gonna lift my voice and sing
Of the love and joy He brings
Everytime I praise His name
His love rains down on me

Love is raining down on me
Joy is deep inside of me
Praise; I'll lift my hands to thee
Cuz your love, your love
Love is raining down on me
Joy is deep inside of me
Praise; I'll lift my hands to thee
Cuz your love rains down on me

// To Da River //

Ahh, for shiggity
Mr. Boney Bone Corleone, Lil Zane
And the one and only busta Javiggadink
(Lil Zane, ahh ahh)
Yo, holla at em Zane
Let em know how we do pimpin'

Wasn't for him, I wouldn't be alive
Chastised for tellin' lies, since then baptized
Look in my eyes, can you see the pain?
Why does the sun shine when it rain?
Hard times got me feelin' daddy never did a thang
I'm God's chosen he put me in a Rolls and
Keeps my wrists frozen, never brown nosin'
Like an explosion, I cause a commotion
Spit the truth like a prophet, I talk to the ocean
People fear what they can't understand
I thank God that I can, I stay focused keepin' him in my plan
Never losin' my faith, haters gonna try to degrade
Gotta be in my state of mind or relate
Gotta know this is the end and ain't no time to waste
Time to face your fate and I pray you don't end up in a lake
Do whatever it takes, so many mistakes we made
But we gon' all get it right once we down by the riverside

Going down
(We going down to the river, take it to the river)
Going down, baby
(Yo, down to the river, take it to the river)
Going dow-ow-ow-own
I'm going down, baby
(We going down to the river)

I'm gonna lay down...
All of my Glocks and automatics
I'm charismatic like crack addicts
Ya wreak havoc like road ragers in bad traffic
It gets drastic but he's fantastic in attracting
No more packin', now we're fastin'
[?] passion
How can I get this life everlastin'
Sick of blastin' and dashin'
Flashin' like Charles Manson
He payed the ransom
Now I'm glory, holler, dancin'
I'm flippin' and rippin' and comin' with lyrical styles y'all never heard
Tryna reach them partners that be on them covers flippin' birds
Forget the English spit rhymes para mi gente
Buster and Javanni bringin' beats like Tito Puente
Salsa, merengue, ritmos calientes
Azuca sabroso para ti y para mi
Headin' down to the riverside so I can let the old man die
When I come out of the water a new man finna come alive
Revived with the Holy Ghost and tears in my eyes

Going down
(We going down to the river, take it to the river)
Going down, baby
(Yo, down to the river, take it to the river)
Going dow-ow-ow-own
I'm going down, baby
(We going down to the river)

We so hot
We don't stop
We take it to the river
You know we go down, down
'Cause
We so hot

I'm sick of packin' all these nines, slingin' dimes
And smokin' on the marijuana
Chillin' with pretty mommas from Havana in the Bahamas
Plus demons tryin' to see me hot like I'm in the sauna
And I'm just tryin' to get ya loose kinda like Madonna

Everybody I know, tell em it's time to go
Me and T-Bone in the '64 sittin' real low
'Bout to roll to the riverside
Put that liquor to the side
Ain't no need for gettin' high; stay alive, payin' tithe

Plus, El Shaddai, Eloyhim got me trippin' y'all
Never really laid down my burdens
'Cause I don't wanna be left and burnin'
Flirtin' with death and ain't promised my last breath
Dressed in prison blues, Holy Spirit got me under arrest

I used to be a thug, sold drugs, might assault ya
Stepped up in the church, got converted at the altar
And I don't fault ya, fell back and he caught ya
Out tryin' to floss better live what he taught ya

Going down
(We going down to the river, take it to the river)
Going down, baby
(Yo, down to the river, take it to the river)
Going dow-ow-ow-own
I'm going down, baby
(We going down to the river)

We so hot
We don't stop
We take it to the river
You know we go down, down
'Cause
We so hot

We going down to the river, take it to the river
Yo, yo, down to the river, down to the river

I don't wanna do no more dirt (I feel blessed)
If the path I was on was wrong (I feel blessed)
It's time to come home

It doesn't matter where you been
Or what you did wrong
It doesn't matter who you are
You're always welcome
It only matters that your heart believes
And you confess
If you committed any sin you'll be forgiven

Calling on all of God's children (Time to come home)
If you wanna be delivered (Time to come home)
I've been rescued by the Saviour (Time to come home)
If you wanna be in His favour (Time to come home)

Come on home
Come on come on home
Ooh yeah yeah
Come on home

If you can't see your way out
And you're drowning in your regrets
If you have everything you want
But you still can't find happiness
It's when you feel like you're forsaken
Life can be so hopeless
Maybe you need to come home
So your life can be cleansed

Calling on all of God's children (Time to come home)
If you wanna be delivered (Time to come home)
I've been rescued by the Saviour (Time to come home)
If you wanna be in His favour (Time to come home)

Don't bare the burden all by yourself (By yourself)
The Redeemer's here He's gonna give you help (Give you help)
Come unto Him and He will give you rest
For any heart that's heavy laden
Soul salvation, ooh

Calling on all of God's children (Time to come home)
If you wanna be delivered (Time to come home)
I've been rescued by the Saviour (Time to come home)
If you wanna be in His favour (Time to come home)

My home, Your home
In His everlasting arms
My home, Your home
In His everlasting arms

Calling on all of God's children (Time to come home)
If you wanna be delivered (Time to come home)
I've been rescued by the Saviour (Time to come home)
If you wanna be in His favour (Time to come home)

Don't you know it's time to come home
Deliver me
I've been rescued by the Saviour
Don't you wanna be in His favour

My home, Your home
In His everlasting arms
My home, Your home
In His everlasting arms
My home, Your home
In His everlasting arms
My home, Your home
In His everlasting arms

Time to come home
