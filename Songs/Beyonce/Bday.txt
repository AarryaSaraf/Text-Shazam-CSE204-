// Creole //

Baby, I see you, that look in your eyes
Hips that keep shaking, mysterious style
Exotically tempting, familiar to me
That Creole sexy, it's all over me

So all my red bones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and you call it Creole
So all my red bones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and you call it Creole

(Creole!) When I look real good
(Creole!) Whenever I talk real good
(Creole!) Whenever I bounce real good
Just in case you wanna know, that's your secret
(Creole!) When she look that good
(Creole!) Whenever she talk that good
(Creole!) Whenever she bounce that good
Ladies, if you wanna know, this your secret
Creole!
Bad, bad, bad, bad yellow bone
Bad, bad, bad, bad red bone
Bad, bad, bad, bad brown bone
Bad, bad, bad, bad to the bone

For all of my brown bones
That make a good broth
And all of my red bones that make a good sauce
The yellow bone flavor is familiar to me
Mix it all together; it's a delicacy

So all my red bones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and you call it Creole
So all my red bones get on the floor
And all my yellow bones get on the floor
And all my brown bones get on the floor
Then you mix it up and you call it Creole

(Creole!) When I look real good
(Creole!) Whenever I talk real good
(Creole!) Whenever I bounce real good
Just in case you wanna know, that's your secret
(Creole!) When she look that good
(Creole!) Whenever she talk that good
(Creole!) Whenever she bounce that good
Ladies, if you wanna know, this your secret
Creole!
Bad, bad, bad, bad yellow bone
Bad, bad, bad, bad red bone

// Lost Yo Mind //

OMG, you done lost yo' motherfreakin' mind!

You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
They told me 'bout all the lies (The lies)
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind

I could shed so many tears
But I won't let you see me crying
Now it all adds up
Even the numbers
Let me exactly hear
But you you wonder
I know how my mama felt
Getting ran over
But this ain't a cycle here
This one is over
Something told me to check my time
If I'm the one that's always crying

Now that it's over
I can move on from here
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
I could've told ya
It's all in the atmosphere
I can't control ya
But I'm not a pushover no more

You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
They told me 'bout all the lies (The lies)
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind

You could shed so many tears
But you won't let me see you crying
If she really loves ya
Than that's what ya need to build
I'm more than your woman
I know you don't love her
I painted it for ya
But you picked the colors
At night you'll get over
Yeah, like you will never
I trusted you through all these years
And I'm the one that's always crying

Now that it's over
I can move on from here
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
The melody told ya
Exactly the pain I feel
Reap what you sow, boy
I'm not a pushover

You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (You lost it)
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
They told me 'bout all the lies (The lies)
I took you back all those times
You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine (Wasn't mine)
Many earrings must I find
You must've just lost yo mind

I always knew you were counterfeit
That's what you get
I see you crying
Excuses after excuses
Pretending that we exclusive
I stuck around all these years
I dried and cried all your tears
I trusted you despite my fears
And I refuse to keep on trying

Now that it's over
I can move over
Glad that it's over
So glad that it's over
You just confirmed it
This ain't a warning
Been living a double life
You must have lost yo mind

You must have lost yo mind
You must've just lost yo mind (Yo mind)
(You crazy!)
You must've just lost yo mind
(You crazy!)
They told me 'bout all the lies
(You lost yo mind!)
I took you back all those times
(Tell ya one more time!)
You must have lost yo mind!
(You lost yo mind!)
That Chloe crop bag ain't mine
(It was not mine!)
Many earrings must I find?
(Hey!)
You must've just lost yo mind
You just lost yo mind

// Encore For The Fans //

I wanted to give all of my fans something extra because this album was so special to me. And it came so effortlessly after I finished the film of my life, "Dreamgirls". Because I was so inspired by Deena, I wrote songs that were saying all the things I wish she would have said in the film. And I wanted to give you an extra special song that Deena sings. It's a pivotal moment when Deena finally does get the strength to stand up for herself and does know who she is and knows what she wants. I'm sure all of you women can relate to the lyrics. This is "Listen"
