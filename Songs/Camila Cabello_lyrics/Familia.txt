Album: Familia

// Celia //

Él se quiere mudar pa' Miami y tomarse un tequila con papi
Él se quiere invitar a mi party, no, uh-huh, uh-huh-huh-huh
Él sonríe, aunque no entiende nada, yo le puedo dar clases privadas
Y un par de besitos en la cara, no, uh-huh, uh-huh-huh-huh

Está fascinao, embobao
Enviciao, bien enamorao

A él le gusta que yo le hable en el oído
Que diga cositas que nunca le han dicho
Él no tiene idea del lío que se ha metido
Con esta loca que ha conocido
Ahora baila las canciones que me gustan
Y la salsa dice que ya no le asusta
Ha vivido toda la vida sin azúcar
Conoció a Celia sin ir pa' Cuba (Cuba)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
La-la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
La-la, la-la, la-la

Yo contigo voy de frente
Y te voy a ser leal hasta la muerte
Que le gusto es evidente
En su cara se lo veo claramente

Está fascinao, embobao
Enviciao, este niño está bien enamorao

A él le gusta que yo le hable en el oído
Que diga cositas que nunca le han dicho
Él no tiene idea del lío en que se ha metido
Con esta loca que ha conocido
Ahora baila las canciones que me gustan
Y la salsa dice que ya no le asusta
Ha vivido toa la vida sin azúcar
Conoció a Celia sin ir pa' Cuba (Cuba)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
La-la, la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
La-la, la-la, la-la

Soy de Cuba

Feelin' like a psycho-freak-freak-freak

Feelin' like a psycho-freak sometimes
Tryin' to get connected, no WiFi
Tell me that you love me, are you lying?
Gimme lemonade, I give you limes
House in the hills is a house of cards
Blink and the fairytale falls apart
Sorry, didn't mean to get so dark
Maybe I'm an alien, Earth is hard

Sometimes I don't trust the way I feel
On my Instagram talkin' 'bout, "I'm healed"
Worryin' if I still got sex appeal
Hopin' that I don't drive off this hill
When we're making love, I wanna be there
And I wanna feel you pullin' my hair
And believe the words you say in my ear
Gotta go outside, I need some air

I want to, want to, want to touch you
Want to touch you, but my fingertips are numb
I want to, want to, want to love you
Want to love you, but my chest is tightenin' up
I want to, want to, want to feel like I can chill
Not have to leave this restaurant
Wish I could be like everyone
But I'm not like anyone

Feelin' like a psycho-freak sometimes
Tryin' to get connected, no WiFi
Tell me that you love me, are you lying?
Gimme lemonade, I give you limes
House in the hills is a house of cards
Blink and the fairytale falls apart
Sorry, didn't mean to get so dark
Maybe I'm an alien, Earth is hard

Feelin' like a psycho-freak-freak-freak
Feelin' like a psycho-freak-freak-freak

Sorry, couldn't focus on the movie
Everybody says they miss the old me
I been on this ride since I was fifteen
I don't blame the girls for how it went down, down
Thinkin' out loud
In the bathroom while my friends laugh on the couch
Wow, moment's gone now
Know you wanna stay, but I think I gotta leave right now

I want to, want to, want to touch you
Want to touch you, but my fingertips are numb
I want to, want to, want to love you
Want to love you, but my chest is tightenin' up
I want to, want to, want to feel like I can chill
Not have to leave this restaurant
Wish I could be like everyone
But I'm not like anyone

Feelin' like a psycho-freak sometimes
Tryin' to get connected, no WiFi
Tell me that you love me, are you lying?
Gimme lemonade, I give you limes
House in the hills is a house of cards
Blink and the fairytale falls apart
Sorry, didn't mean to get so dark
Maybe I'm an alien, Earth is hard

Feelin' like a psycho-freak-freak-freak
Feelin' like a psycho-freak-freak-freak

// Bam Bam //

You said you hated the ocean, but you're surfin' now
I said I'd love you for life, but I just sold our house
We were kids at the start, I guess we're grown-ups now (Mmm)
Couldn't ever imagine even havin' doubts
But not everything works out, no

Now I'm out dancin' with strangers
You could be casually datin'
Damn, it's all changin' so fast

Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around
And it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standin'
But now I'm dancin'
He's all over me

Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam (Así es la vida)
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Uh-huh)
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Eh, eh, uh-huh)
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Uh-huh)
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam

It's been a hell of a year, thank God we made it out
Yeah we were riding a wave, and trying not to drown
And on the surface I held it together
But underneath, I sorta came unwound
Where would I be? You're all that I need
My world, baby, you hold me down
You always hold me down, now

I've been the breaker and broken
Every mistake turned to moments
Wouldn't take anything back

Así es la vida, sí (Así es)
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around
And it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standin'
But now I'm dancin'
She's all over me (He's all over me)

Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam (Ahí, ahí)
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam (Pónganle azúcar, mi gente!)

Sigue bailando, hey
Sigue bailando (Keep dancing, yeah)
Sigue bailando (Keep dancing, yeah)
Sigue bailando

(Hay amor en todos lados) Sigue bailando
(Sigue, sigue, sigue bailando) Sigue bailando
(Hay amor en todos lados) Sigue bailando, woh
(Sigue, sigue, sigue bailando)

Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around
And it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standin'
But now I'm dancin'
She's all over me (He's all over me) (Hey! Hey!)

Now I'm, Now I'm dancin' (Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam)
Keep dancing, yeah
Now I'm, Now I'm dancin' (Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam)
Keep dancing, yeah
Now I'm, Now I'm dancin' (Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam)
Keep dancing, yeah (Bidi, bam-bam-bam-bam) (Hey! Hey!)

// La Buena Vida //

I woke up happy by accident
I forgot you were gone again
And all the words you typed out, I read, uh-huh
But I'm alone on my sofa bed, uh-huh
My skin's so soft today
But you're so far away
And I can go off the memories, uh-huh
You're starting to feel like a memory, uh-huh

And I thought we'd be traveling the world together
Making love in the afternoon
But I'm forgetting what it's like to wake up next to you
And this is what I go through

You should be here, should be with me tonight
'Stead, you're working, you're working all the time
Why am I home alone with your glass of wine?
Oh, no, oh, no
This is not the life

La, la, la, la, la, la, la

I don't wanna be the one making plans all the time
Asking you what's on your mind
I know I'm not on your mind
Scared you're gonna fall behind

Listen, listen, I get it, I get it
More than anybody, I get it
Life is right now, you tend to forget it
Looking back, you're gonna regret it

And I thought we'd be traveling the world together
Making love in the afternoon
But I'm forgetting what it's like to wake up next to you
And this is what I'm going through, baby

You should be here, should be with me tonight
'Stead, you're working, you're working all the time
Why am I home alone with your glass of wine?
Oh, no, oh, no
This is not the life

(En la vida lo que importa es el amor
Que nos llena el corazón
Lo que nos viene y se va)
But I'm forgetting what it's like to wake up next to you
And this is what I'm going through

You should be here, should be with me tonight
'Stead, you're working, you're working all the time
Why am I home alone with your glass of wine?
Oh, no, oh, no
This is not the life

I imagined when you first spent the night
I don't feel like yours, you don't feel like mine
And my twenties gonna pass me by
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no
This is not the life
Oh, no, oh, no
Not my life

(La buena vida, la buena vida
¿Dónde está?
La buena vida, la buena vida
¿Dónde está?
La buena vida, la buena vida
¿Dónde está?)

Yo te necesito, ¿dónde estás?

// Quiet //

You're coming over
I started takin' breaths 'cause I was too anxious
Too much to take in, years in the making, no
Mm

No melatonin
No meditation
Can ease my anticipation
No drink I'm making's helping the waiting, no
Ooh

It's you, boy
I'm cool like an icicle till I see you, boy
Think I'm gonna die

But now your hands are touching my waist in the back of the car
You just couldn't wait
And now my hands are moving in ways like I need you right now
I just couldn't wait
And my m-m-minds
Made so much noise for so long and it's gone
'Cause when you kiss me it's quiet
Oh, it's quiet
Quiet
Oh, it's quiet

Did you get taller?
Your hair is longer
Couple tattoos since I saw you
Looking at your hands
Thinking of my plans for 'em
Ooh

Ooh, but what if I panic?
What if I'm damaged?
What if I'm just not who you imagined?
I just can't focus
And you're gorgeous
And I'm hopeless
God damn it

It's you, boy
I'm cool like an icicle till I see you, boy
Think I'm gonna die

But now your hands are touching my waist in the back of the car
You just couldn't wait
And now my hands are moving in ways like I need you right now
I just couldn't wait
And my m-m-minds
Made so much noise for so long and it's gone
'Cause when you kiss me it's quiet
Oh, it's quiet
Quiet
Oh, it's quiet

It's you, boy
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's you, boy

But now your hands are touching my waist in the back of the car
You just couldn't wait
And now my hands are moving in ways like I need you right now
I just couldn't wait
And my m-m-minds
Made so much noise for so long and it's gone
'Cause when you kiss me it's quiet
Oh, it's quiet
Quiet
Oh, it's quiet

// Boys Don't Cry //

I know thoughts you don't want in your head
Are spinnin' 'round-'round-'round
I know you got demons from the past
Slowin' you down-down-down
But you don't answer your FaceTime
You never had much of a poker face
It doesn't make you less of a man
You're just human right now

When I'm afraid of the world, when every part of me hurts
You don't know how many times you've saved me
So why you hiding from me, it's only making it worse
I just want to be close, my baby

Give me your pain, I'll take the weight off your shoulders
Don't be afraid, fall into me, let me hold you
We weren't made to hold back the rain from the sky
Who ever told you that boys don't cry, boys don't cry?

Hate it when you shut me out
Acting like it's your shit to figure out
Don't want to be touched
Don't want to discuss
I get it, I just (Uh)
Now I'm in my head
About what's in your head
Come back to bed
Can we talk about it?
It's not stupid, it's not drama
It's just trauma turned to armor
Keeping you from me, no performing
If you love me, come and touch me (Yah)

When I'm afraid of the world, when every part of me hurts
You don't know how many times you've saved me
So why you hiding from me, it's only making it worse
I just want to be close, my baby
Give me your pain, I'll take the weight off your shoulders
Don't be afraid, fall into me, let me hold you
We weren't made to hold back the rain from the sky
Who ever told you that boys don't cry, boys don't cry?

Yeah-yeah, yuh yeah
Boys don't cry, boys don't cry
Yeah-yeah, yuh yeah
Boys don't cry, boys don't cry

Come my baby, lay your head on me
Lay your head on me, lay your head on me
Come my baby, lay your head on me
Lay your head on me, lay your head on me
(You know I gotcha)
Come my baby, lay your head on me
(You know I'd do anything for ya)
Lay your head on me, lay your head on me
Come my baby, lay your head on me
Lay your head on me, lay your head on me

Give me your pain, I'll take the weight off your shoulders
Don't be afraid, fall into me, let me hold you
We weren't made to hold back the rain from the sky
Who ever told you that boys don't cry, boys don't cry?
Ooh-oh
Boys don't cry, boys don't cry

// Hasta Los Dientes //

Tú me gustas como no tienes idea
Y saber de tu pasado me noquea
Hasta dormida te imagino con ella
Eso me enferma

No es tu culpa lo que me haces sentir
Yo estoy loca, pero loca por ti

Niño, hasta en mis sueños tú me haces sufrir
Te vi con tu ex y me quise morir
No te quiero compartir, te quiero solo pa' mí
¿Me entiendes que mi cuerpo se enciende?
Cuando tú me besas la depre' me da
Saber que has besado así a otra más
No te quiero compartir, te quiero solo pa' mí
¿Me entiendes? Me duelen hasta los dientes

Yo sigo aferrada a tu pasado
Viéndote de la mano con ella
Soñé que otros besos le has dado
Y miraron juntos las estrellas

En mi mente siempre te maldigo
Porque tienes mi corazón preso
Que sepa que ahora estás conmigo
No le pertenecen tus besos

Si quieres que venga por ti
Pa' que vea bien que solo me amas a mí

Niño, hasta en mis sueños tú me haces sufrir
Te vi con tu ex y me quise morir
No te quiero compartir, te quiero solo pa' mí
¿Me entiendes que mi cuerpo se enciende?
Cuando tú me besas la depre' me da
Saber que has besado así a otra más
No te quiero compartir, te quiero solo pa' mí
¿Me entiendes? Me duelen hasta los dientes

La, ah-ah
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, ah-ah
La, ah-ah
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, ah-ah

No es tu culpa lo que me haces sentir
Yo estoy loca, pero loca por ti

Niño, hasta en mis sueños tú me haces sufrir
Te vi con tu ex y me quise morir
No te quiero compartir, te quiero solo pa' mí
¿Me entiendes que mi cuerpo se enciende?
Cuando tú me besas la depre' me da
Saber que has besado así a otra más
No te quiero compartir, te quiero solo pa' mí
¿Me entiendes? Me duelen hasta los dientes

La, ah-ah
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, ah-ah
La, ah-ah
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, ah-ah

// No Doubt //

Buta-yuh-yuh
Buta-yuh-yuh
Buta-yuh-yuh
Seeing visions on the ceiling
Drunken kisses, heavy breathing
You're up against the wall
She's unbuttoning your jeans and you tell her that you want it all
She loves you all night, makes you breakfast
Not just sex, it's a real connection
And out of love, we'd fall
And it makes me wanna scream why I'm making up this shit at all
I'm paranoid there's something I don't know
Got my demons creepin' on the low
But I don't even hear them anymore

The way we're making love, you leave with me no doubt
The way you're biting on the corner of my mouth
You take the psycho out of my brain
Yeah
And leave me with no doubt
And I can see it in your eyes when you slow down
You take the psycho out of my brain
Yeah
And leave me with no doubt

Buta-yuh-yuh
Buta-yuh-yuh
Buta-yuh-yuh
My head is racin'
Plead your innocence
You're not guilty, I'm hyper vigilant
I'm getting bad again (I'm getting bad again)
'Cause when shit is gettin' good, I just spiral into bad again
Imagination has gone belligerent
Seeing red flags that don't even exist
And that's the head I'm in
'Cause when shit is getting good, I just worry 'bout the bad again
I'm paranoid there's something I don't know
Got my demons creepin' on the low
But I don't even hear them anymore

The way we're making love you leave with me no doubt
The way you're biting on the corner of my mouth
You take the psycho out of my brain
Yeah
And leave me with no doubt
And I can see it in your eyes when you slow down
You take the psycho out of my brain
Yeah
And leave me with no doubt

(Bésame, besa-bésame) Buta-yuh-yuh
(Bésame, besa-bésame) Buta-yuh-yuh
(La cintura, tócame pa' que no sienta los celos que estoy sintiendo)
Oh, I'm going outta my mind, I (Bésame, besa-bésame)
Outta my mind, I (Bésame, besa-bésame)
I'm going outta my mind
(La cintura, tócame pa' que no sienta los celos)

Ooh, the way we're making love you leave with me no doubt
The way you're biting on the corner of my mouth
You take the psycho out of my brain
Yeah
And leave me with no doubt
And I can see it in your eyes when you slow down
You take the psycho out of my brain
Yeah
And leave me with no doubt

// Don't Go Yet //

Oh, my love, oh, yeah, yeah
I'm in love, yeah

I'll replay this moment for months
Alone in my head, waitin' for it to come
I wrote all your lines and the script's in my mind, and
I hope that you follow it for once

I imagine myself in satin, the room was platinum and gold
I, dance and catch your eye, you'll be mesmerized, oh
We find a corner, then your hands in my hair
Finally we're here, so, I
Sayin' you got a flight, need an early night, no
Don't go yet

Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet
Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet
Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet
Whatcha' leavin' for, when my night is yours?
Just a little more, don't go yet

Baby, don't go yet, 'cause I wore this dress for a lil' drama
In a bed, I bet that you think that you know, but you don't
Baby, come to mama
I get, I get what I want when I want
And I get it how I wanna, wanna
And I want you baby, gotta get you, baby

We find a corner, then your hands in my hair
Finally we're here, so, I
Sayin' you got a flight, need an early night, no
Don't go yet

Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet
Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet (No, no)
Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet
Whatcha' leavin' for, when my night is yours?
Just a little more, don't go yet

Come along
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (Don't go yet)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Don't go yet), hey

(Oh-no-no, don't leave yet)
(No te vayas, quédate) Dale
(Oh-no-no, don't leave yet) Ahora voy yo
(No te vayas, quédate)
(Oh-no-no, don't leave yet) Stay a little longer
(No te vayas, quédate) Know you really wanna
(Oh-no-no, don't leave yet) Stay a little longer
(No te vayas, quédate) Oh

Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet (Oh)
Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet (Oh, don't go yet)
Oh, yeah, don't go yet, don't go yet (Oh)
Whatcha' leavin' for, when my night is yours?
Just a little more

Whatcha' leavin' for, when my night is yours? Yours, yours
Whatcha' leavin' for, when my night is yours?
Just a little more, don't go yet

// Lola //

Lola was the smartest in the school
She was a supernova
She had a mind beyond her time
It was a thrill to know her

She had dreams, she'd fall in love some place like Barcelona
Lola, Lola, Lola, Lola

She could've walked on the moon, yeah
She could've found us a cure
But family didn't have no food
And she had to leave school to work

Nobody breaks the ceiling
Nobody where she's from
Nobody breaks the ceiling, yeah

Nobody's listening
So she won't speak, won't speak
All of those dreams are fading slowly, slowly
She knows the stories 'bout the police, police
It's just the way it is so don't speak, don't speak

Lola
She believed the world, they promised her, but now she's older
She's seen the people disagree and disappear
The power's out for days
No food is on its way
Nothing changes
This ain't the dream they sold us
Lola, Lola, Lola

She could've walked on the moon, yeah
Could've found us a cure
But she worried 'bout her children
Ninety miles till the shore

Nobody breaks the ceiling
Nobody where she's from
Nobody breaks the ceiling, yeah
Nobody

Nobody's listening
So she won't speak
Won't speak
All of those dreams are fading slowly, slowly
She knows the stories 'bout the police, police
It's just the way it is so don't speak, don't speak

Se pone bien bonita
Como lista pa' un desfile
Le prometieron ser la
Reina del Caribe
Pero alguien le cambió
El guión de cine
Y comenzar de nuevo
Solo pide

Del bajo mundo ella proviene
Cuanto vales cuanto tienes
Ese es el precio de mi Lola
Cuando no hay salida
Quiere libertad
Quiere patria y vida

Nobody's listening
So she won't speak
Won't speak
All of those dreams are fading slowly, slowly
She knows the stories 'bout the police, police
It's just the way it is so don't speak, don't speak

Quiso sacarse el dolor
Matando su corazón
Ella soñaba volar
Pero el avión nunca
Despegó
Cuanto sufre el paso
Del tiempo y siempre sola
En mi Havana cuantas Lola's

// everyone at this party //

Didn't wanna ask our friend if you were gonna be here and make the whole thing weird
But I was nervous in the car just in case you are, just in case the coast ain't clear
And I'm looking over people's shoulders
And that's fucked up, I know that
And I just had this vision of you looking at me different when you saw this dress
But I'd have one drink and I'd say the wrong thing, so it's probably for the best
And I'm looking over peoples shoulders
And I'm hoping that you're somewhere close

Everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you
You're the only one I wanna run into
But I never do
Everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you
I don't wanna search for you in every room
But I always do

I got in last night, staying on the west side
Scotty told me you're here
And I keep having these thoughts
Did we fuck it up or not?
Did we waste two years?
And did you get the space you needed?
Did you realize you don't need me?
Hey, did you realize you don't need me?

Everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you
You're the only one I wanna run into
But I never do
Everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you
Don't wanna search for you in every room
But I always do

Everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you
Hey, did you realize you don't need me?
