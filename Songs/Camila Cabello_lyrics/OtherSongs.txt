// Bad Things //

[Camila Cabello (Machine Gun Kelly):]
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good (so good), that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Machine Gun Kelly (Camila Cabello):]
Aye
Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips (yeah)
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
Like I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

[Camila Cabello (Machine Gun Kelly):]
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
(Damn)

[Machine Gun Kelly (Camila Cabello):]
Aye, I can't explain it
I love the pain
And I love the way that your breath
Numbs me like Novocaine
And we are
(Oh)
Always high
Keep it strange

[Camila Cabello and Machine Gun Kelly:]
OK, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same

[Machine Gun Kelly (Camila Cabello):]
Let me paint the picture
(Yeah)
Couch by the kitchen
(Yeah)
Nothin' but your heels on
Losing our religion
(Mmm)
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm that voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
(I want you wherever)
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
Like I want you forever
Even when we're not together
(Oh, whoa)
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

[Camila Cabello (Machine Gun Kelly):]
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

The way we love, is so unique
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it
Just you and me
(Right)
Cause we're just living
Between the sheets
(You said)

[Machine Gun Kelly & Camila Cabello:]
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
Like I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

[Camila Cabello (Machine Gun Kelly):]
Oh, baby
Am I out of my head?
(Am I?)
Am I out of my mind?
(Am I?)
If you only knew the bad things I like
(if you only knew)
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated (yeah)
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do (do, do)
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it (so good)
Oh, baby!
What can I say, it's complicated

Words dripping off your mouth, contagious, uh-oh, uh-oh
No skin off your back to blame us
Now waiting on the world to save us, uh-oh, uh-oh

// Crying In The Club //

You think that you'll die without him
You know that's a lie that you tell yourself
You fear that you'll lay alone forever now
It ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no

So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up like you've never been this free
'Til you feel the sunrise
Let the music warm your body like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires

Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
Let the beat carry 'way your tears as they fall baby
Ain't no crying in the club (hey, hey)
With a little faith, your tears turn to ecstasy
Ain't no crying in the club

Ain't no crying in the club
I won't, I won't, I
Ain't no crying in the club

You may think that you'll die without her
But you know that's a lie that you told yourself
You fear that you'll never meet another so pure
But it ain't true, ain't true, ain't true, no

So put your arms around me tonight
Let the music lift you up like you've never been so high
Open up your heart to me
Let the music lift you up like you've never been this free

Let the music warm your body like the heat of a thousand fires
The heat of a thousand fires

// Curious //

Dum, dum-dum-dum
Dum, dum-dum-dum

I lose myself when you start talkin'
There's something riveting about you, it's got me confused
If we went back to your apartment
Would you be a gentleman and a bad boy too?

I know you think, I'm innocent
Little do you know where my mind has been?
I don't have much experience
Could you relieve me of my ignorance?
It's true (It's true, it's true)
Been wondering about you

I'm just cu-, I'm just curious
What you do, just got the two of us
Hit me down, take me up
Can you teach me how to love?
I'm just curious

Dum, dum-dum-dum
You got me feeling
Dum, dum-dum-dum
You got me feeling

I'm kinda nervous but I like it (Yeah)
Will you live up to the image that I got of you?
You're not usually my type, yeah
I think that that might be the reason that I'm here with you (Oh, oh)

I know you think, I'm innocent
Little do you know where my mind has been? (No, no)
I don't have much experience
Could you relieve me of my ignorance?
It's true (It's true, it's true)
Been wondering about you (Yeah, ayy-ayy)

// Died //

Last night I died
You gave me one look, I cried
I don't know what you did, but
Now I'm shook up, now I'm love-drunk
Need a doctor, couldn't make it out last night
'Cause I died

Oh my God, I hope I didn't blow my shot
But I was so unprepared, I just stared at you
You turned around and said my name
I didn't think you'd know my name
The blood is rushing to my face
There's no grace with you

Mmm, you got me mumbling like, na-la-la-la-la
You got me stuttering like, I-I-I-I
I'm fine, how 'bout you? Wait, I already asked that, oops

Last night I died
You gave me one look, I cried
I don't know what you did, but
Now I'm shook up, now I'm love-drunk
Need a doctor, couldn't make it out last night
'Cause I died
Last night I died

I-In my brain, I'm playing out the things we'd say
So tell me what I wanna hear, let's get out of here
Oh-oh, take my hand
You told me that you'll never dance
But you're looking for any excuse to get real close to me

Mmm, you got me mumbling like, na-la-la-la-la
You got me stuttering like, I-I-I-I
I'm fine, how 'bout you? Wait, I already asked that, oops

Last night I died
You gave me one look, I cried
I don't know what you did, but
Now I'm shook up, now I'm love-drunk
Need a doctor, couldn't make it out last night
'Cause I died
Last night I died

La-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la, yeah
No-oh, I don't know what you did, but
Now I'm shook up, now I'm love-drunk
Need a doctor, couldn't make it out last night, yeah
Last night I died

// Eyes On You //

I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you

Won't say I'm yours, won't say I'm not
I'm somewhere between, while you're at the bar downtown
It's been a month and we're getting close
But not close enough, to love you or hate you now
In the morning, you look like an angel
But the devil's buying you a table
Serving a drink, you're making your rounds
Picture it all, I'm out of my mind right now

And everybody told me, so I

I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
I know that you think I don't
The pictures you had, the numbers in your phone
I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you

And everybody told me, so I

I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
I know that you think I don't
The pictures you have, the numbers in your phone
I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you

And everybody told me, but I
I had to see it with my own eyes

I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Tell me that you're home, what a beautiful lie
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
I know that you think I don't (I know that you think I don't)
The pictures you have, the numbers in your phone
I know where you go at the end of the night
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you

Ahh, yeah
Ahh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Baby, 'cause I got my eyes on you
Ahh

And this is the part that my daddy told me
He got me feelin' like

// I'll Be Home For Christmas //

I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas (I'll be home for Christmas)
You can count on me (You can count on me)
Please have snow (Have snow) and mistletoe (Yeah, yeah)
And presents under the tree (Under the tree)

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams
If only in my dreams

In my dreams, my dreams
My dreams

// Knows Me //

I get paranoid sometimes in conversation
I get paranoid sometimes, I
I got people I call friends with motivations
Hard to tell who's on my side
I was too young, I've seen too much
Wise people change, I got what they want
I, I get paranoid sometimes in conversation
But you and I see eye-to-eye

Can we lay here for a while?
I forgot what it feels like
Talk until we fall asleep
'Cause honestly

I need somebody who knows me
I need somebody who knows me
All these keep making me lonely
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody who knows me
I need somebody who knows me
Darling come over and hold me
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody who knows me

'Cause if you promise me that you'll keep all my secrets
I will take you at your word, yeah
'Cause I will hold you when you crumble into pieces
But right now I need you first
Yeah, I do

Can we lay here for a while?
I forgot what it feels like
Talk until we fall asleep
'Cause honestly

I need somebody who knows me
I need somebody who knows me
All these keep making me lonely
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody who knows me
I need somebody who knows me
Darling come over and hold me
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody who knows me

'Cause I need somebody who (Holds me)
And I could use someone who (Holds me)
And you make me feel like you (Knows me)

Can we lay here for a while?
I forgot what it feels like
Talk until we fall asleep
'Cause honestly

I need somebody who knows me
I need somebody who knows me
All these keep making me lonely
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody who knows me
I need somebody who knows me
Darling come over and hold me
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody who knows me

Knows me
Look at me, look at me, ooh (Knows me)
'Cause I need somebody who (Holds me)
And I could use someone who (Holds me)
And you make me feel like you (Knows me)
I need somebody who knows me

// Must Be Love //

Wise men say, only fools rush in
But I took your hand and I jumped right in
I guess everything has a consequence, oh I, I
I can hide, and put on a show
'Cause the highs are highs
But the lows are lows
You control me more than you've ever known
But I wouldn't have it any other way

Must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, up, oh
It must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, oh

I fall hard, that's just how I am
And I bend and break like a rubber band
Everything gets real after two AM
So don't, don't, don't look at me like that
When you're the one that implied that
'Cause I'm gonna look at you right back
I promise you ain't gonna like that, yeah
We fuss and we fight, forget that night
And I wouldn't have it any other way

Must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, up, oh
It must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, up, oh

(Love, love, love...)
And I could just give you up

Must be love
Or this wouldn't hurt so much (so much)
And I wouldn't think so much
And I could just give you up, up

// My Oh My (Remix) //

[Camila Cabello:]
They say he likes a good time (My oh my)
He comes alive at midnight (Every night)
My mama doesn't trust him (My oh my)
He's only here for one thing, but (So am I)

Yeah, a little bit older, a black leather jacket
A bad reputation, insatiable habits
He was onto me, one look and I couldn't breathe, yeah
I said, if he kissed me, I might let it happen (Oh)

I swear on my life that I've been a good girl (Oh)
Tonight, I don't wanna be her

DaBaby make her forget what she learned from her daddy
I don't be tripping on lil' shawty, I let her do whatever she please

She came with you, then left with me
I went up a point, let's call it even {Yeah, yeah}
Don't like the car she in, gon' end up buyin' her a new Bimmer (Let's go)
That girl know what she want, she make me take it off when she see me (Let's go)
She say I make her wet whenever my face pop up on TV
I had to say, "No disrespect, gotta do it safe or you can keep it"
Pop star, I'm fresh up out the trap and I'm going Bieber
She know I'm a call away, she can drop a pin and I'd come meet her
Stand next to me, you gon' end up catchin' a fever {Yeah, yeah}
I'm hot

[Camila Cabello:]
I swear on my life that I've been a good girl (Good girl, good girl)
Tonight, I don't wanna be her

[Gunna:]
I don't wanna make assumptions (Mm)
But I can tell you're up to something (Oh)
She wanna see me clean, no quarantine (Clean)

Prolly should have gave her a warning (Warning)
We party hard to the next mornin' (Ah)
We livin' in the Hills, see the sun beam (Beam)
I found out what it is, she in love with me
We need us sunscreen, eyes on me
We still on our feet, can't touch this
You know it's no slowin' down, we at high speed (My, my, my)
And you know a good girl gotta love me

// Never Be The Same (Remix) //

Something must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feeling all the highs, feeling all the pain
Let go on the wheel, it's the bullet lane
Now I'm seeing red, not thinking straight
Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me

Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
Never be the same

Sneaking in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch, I could overdose
You said, "Stop playing it safe
Boy, I wanna see you lose control"

Just like nicotine, (nicotine) heroin, morphine (morphine)
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need (all I need)
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame, you're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

I'll never be the same
Never be the same, girl
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
And now

You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I blame)
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I'm sayin')

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame (you're to blame)
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame, you're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

// Not Killin' It Today //

Accidentally made a joke that killed your boner
And I woke up so hungover
And I didn't even drink so much last night
And I hurt your feelings on the phone 'cause I'm pmsing
And you sent the sweetest message
I forgot to reply and I couldn't even tell you why

Most days I'm hilarious, confident, and I don't get jealous
And I'm sexy and I'm fun
Most days I'm affectionate and I love you like I invented it
I'm not usually this dumb, but

I'm just not killin' it today
No today is not my day
Hahaha gotta laugh
Someone please, give me a break
It's written on my face, I wanna cry and eat some cake
Try again tomorrow babe, I'm not killing it today
No no no no no, No no no no no no
No no, no
I'm not killin' it today

Accidentally I sneezed and peed little
Looked in the mirror and my eyes jiggled
And it helps when you tell me I'm perfect but not this time

Most days I'm hilarious, confident, and I don't get jealous
And I'm sexy and I'm fun
Most days I'm affectionate and I love you like I invented it
I'm not usually this dumb, but

I'm just not killin' it today
No today is not my day
Hahaha gotta laugh
Someone please, give me a break
It's written on my face, I wanna cry and eat some cake
Try again tomorrow babe, I'm not killing it today
No no no no no, No no no no no no
No no, no
I'm not killin' it today

I'm just not killin' it today
No today is not my day
Hahaha gotta laugh
Someone please, give me a break
It's written on my face, I wanna cry and eat some cake
Try again tomorrow babe, I'm not killing it today
No no no no no, No no no no no no
No no, no
I'm not killin' it today
No no no no no, No no no no no no
No no, no
I'm not killin' it today

Usando la lengua te quiero besar
De cero contigo quiero comenzar
Contigo me voy de vacaciones mensual
Recuerdo la vez que te conocí fue en un verano en Nueva York
Dudo mucho que en este mundo encuentres a otro como yo
Creo que no hay (No hay)
Se fue sin decir bye (Bye)
Y yo en Washington Heights (Heights)
Siempre te veo online (-line)
Tú sabe' que si yo te tuviera, te lo haría all night (Night)
Si alguno se propasa contigo, ese la va a pasar mal (Mal)

// Only Told The Moon //

Stay back, stay long
And you, move on
I stress, come close
Move on, please don't

Hello, how are you? How you've been?
Lately I wonder how it feels to steal your kiss
Nothing much, just fine I'm doing well
And you can read between the lines but God, I fell

I only told the moon, tonight up on the roof
I told her that I'm scared that all my thoughts they look like you
I only told the moon about the way you move
I asked her to please tell me if you tell things to her too

Silence, too loud
Say it, not now

So how are you? How you've been?
Lately I wonder how it feels to taste your lips
Nothing much, just fine I'm doing well
And you can read between the lines but God, I fell

I only told the moon, tonight up on the roof
I told her that I'm scared that all my thoughts they look like you
I only told the moon about the way you move
I asked her to please tell me if you tell things to her too

That I give it all to you
I give it all to you
I give it all to you
I only told the moon

Ahh and another love song will play on the radio, you know
Ahh and I'll wait for the moon to lean in close
And say…

That he only told the moon, tonight up on the roof
He told me that he's scared that all his thoughts they look like you
I only told the moon about the way you move
I asked her to please tell me if you tell this to her too

That I give it all to you
I give it all to you
I give it all to you
We only told the moon

We only told the moon

// Real Friends (Remix) //

[Camila Cabello:]
No, I think I'll stay in tonight
Skip the conversations and the "Oh, I'm fines"
No, I'm no stranger to surprise
This paper town has let me down too many times
Why do I even try? Give me a reason why
I thought that I could trust you, never mind
Why all the switching sides? Where do I draw the line?
I guess I'm too naive to read the signs

[Camila Cabello & Swae Lee:]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
All they ever do is let me down
Every time I let somebody in
Then I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
Wonder where they're all hidin' out (hidin' out)
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
Gotta get up out of this town
Ooh...

[Swae Lee:]
Trust slow for a reason (reason)
See through the fake pretty easy (yeah)
Stayin' down 'till the world ends
Guilt trips on the weekend (hey)
I pack more than suits in my suitcases
All this cash, that's friendly faces
Been movin' fast, I'm racin' (wait)
Get up, you're going places (c'mon)
Every day, tryna maintain
Same old me, ain't a damn thing change
Real friends screaming, "Gang, gang, gang"

[Camila Cabello & Swae Lee:]
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
All they ever do is let me down (oh-no-no)
Every time I let somebody in (woah)
Then I find out what they're all about (all about)
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
Wonder where they're all hidin' out (hidin' out)
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
Gotta get up out of this town

(Real friends...
Ooh...
Lookin' for some real friends...
Yeah!)

I just wanna talk about nothin'
With somebody that means something (conversation)
Spell the names of all our dreams and demons
For the times that I don't understand
Tell me what's the point of a moon like this
When I'm alone again (yeah yeah yeah)
Can I run away to somewhere beautiful
Where nobody knows my name?

I'm just lookin' for some real friends
All they ever do is let me down
And I let somebody in
But I find out what they're all about
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
All they ever do is let me down
I'm just lookin' for some real friends (real friends)
Gotta get up out of this town, yeah

Spend a fortune with my real friends
Good guess, what we breathe in (ooh)
Pop corns with some real friends
Killin' the scene, yeah (ooh)
Hangin' with my real friends
That I surround myself with (ooh)
You have to have my back (ah)
Lookin' like my real friends

I feel every damn thing again
The sound of your name like a cut

I tried to hold the pieces inside
Tighter I held it, cut like a knife
Blood from our oath falls on your hands, not mine
I used to laugh, just like a child
I feel okay, just for a while, yeah
Then I realized

All I'm left with is this scar tissue
Battle wounds after surviving you (oh)
I'm left with all the bruises, excuses
The truth is: trying to restart, that's the hardest part
The scar tissue

Ooh, ooh, ooh
The scar tissue, ooh, ooh, ooh
That's the hardest part
The scar tissue

Secretly dangerous
The hurt that you're capable of
I couldn't see you coming if I tried
You pulled the trigger and hide

I tried to hold the pieces inside
Tighter I held it, cut like a knife
Blood from our oath falls on your hands, not mine
I used to laugh, just like a child
I feel okay, just for a while, yeah
Then I realized

All I'm left with is this scar tissue
Battle wounds after surviving you (oh)
I'm left with all the bruises, excuses
The truth is: trying to restart, that's the hardest part
The scar tissue

Ooh, ooh, ooh
The scar tissue, ooh, ooh, ooh
That's the hardest part
The scar tissue

Dealing with the scar tissue
Everything you put me through, na na na yeah
Dealing with the scar tissue
Everything you put me through, na na na yeah
Dealing with the scar tissue
Everything you put me through, na na na yeah
Dealing with the scar tissue
Dealing with the scar tissue

Oh, I'm not okay
But I'm getting closer to it everyday
Closer and closer 'til you fade away
All I'm left with is the scar tissue

Yeah, that's the hardest part
The scar tissue

(All the scars, ooh, ooh, ooh)
The scar tissue, ooh, ooh, ooh
(I'm going home, I'm trying)
That's the hardest part
The scar tissue

I'm going home, I'm trying (na na na yeah)
I'm trying (na na na yeah)
I'm going home, I'm trying (na na na yeah)
I'm trying

// Take Me Back Home //

Starry skies, please hold me
River run or slowly
Let me listen closely
Tell me how to love you better

Forest keep in present
Mountains shore, the heavens
Mother teach may lessens
Tell me how to love you better
Tell me how to love you better

Wait, take me back home now
Wait, take me back home now
Change when but I don't know how
But I can't just watch it all
Watch it all, watch it all fall down
I can't just watch it all
Watch it all, watch it all fall down
Wait, take me back home now
Wait, just take me back home now
I need to change, oh, but I don't know how
But I can't just watch it all
Watch it all, watch it all fall down
But I can't just watch it all
Watch it all, watch it all fall down, oh-oh

Na-na-na, yeah, na-na-na
Hey, hey

Watch it all, watch it all fall down

// Taxi //

In a New York taxi cab
With an English man
I have never been kissed like that
So come on, kiss me again
And I felt your heartbreak
Drivin' down Charlotte Street for the first time
Now we are slow dancin' in your kitchen
How time's passed by

We ran out of time again tonight
Happens like this every time
So what are you doing for the rest of your life?

Baby, keep kissin' me softly
Holdin' me, whisperin' quietly
Darlin', I think that this might be the greatest love story
That's never been, never been, never been, never been easy
It's a new feelin' I am findin'
Where the hell have you been hidin'?
We will tell the moon when we are old
The greatest love story that's never been told

Now we are walkin' hand-in-hand
In an English town
Gonna meet your momma and dad
And I am nervous now
Now I am in your home
Eating Sunday roast
And I say the wrong thin'
Then you catch my eye, give me a smile
Say you fit right in

We ran out of time again tonight
Happens like this every time
So what are you doing for the rest of your life?

Baby, keep kissin' me softly
Holdin' me, whisperin' quietly
Darlin', I think that this might be the greatest love story
That's never been, never been, never been, never been easy
It's a new feelin' I am findin'
Where the hell have you been hidin'?
We will tell the moon when we're old
The greatest love story that's never been told...

Funny how no one knows all of our inside jokes
You know my demons by name, I know your beautiful soul
All of the secret we keep, you know that I will never leave...

So just keep kissin' me softly
Holdin' me, whisperin' quietly
Darling, I think that this might be the greatest love story
That's never been told
Never been easy
It's a new feelin' I am findin'
Where the hell have you been hidin'?
We will tell the moon when we're old
The greatest love story that's never been told...

And yet, there's still so much left to unfold
The greatest love story that's never been told...

// Terrified //

Your hands are all tangled in my hair
Must be chemistry
My plans are whatever you want, baby
You got all of me

Save me, save me, I'm falling in love with this kiss (On my lips)
I'm so high, I'm so high that it's making me sick (Makes me sick)
Lay awake thinking of every single "What if," I admit
Never felt like this

Baby, I'm looking at you and I'm terrified
Maybe I knew that you'd been so damn hard to find (Hard to find)
I've been waiting all my life for ya
Every night I wanna die for ya
I don't never wanna cry for ya
Need you to stay
Baby, I'm looking at you and I'm terrified (Terrified)

Whether I'm asleep or awake
Can't get you out of my brain
When I'm in the car, it's getting hard
And I wind up at your place
Arе you asleep? Be awake
I need to kiss your face
Those green eyes, these L.A. skies
I hope they're here to stay, yeah

Save me, save me, I'm falling in love with this kiss (On my lips)
I'm so high, I'm so high that it's making me sick (Makes me sick)
Lay awake thinking of every single "What if," I admit
Never felt like this

Baby, I'm looking at you and I'm terrified (Terrified)
Maybe I know that you'd been so damn hard to find (Hard to find)
I've been waiting all my life for ya
Every night I wanna die for ya
I don't never wanna cry for ya
Need you to stay
Baby, I'm looking at you and I'm terrified (Terrified)

Could you feel me falling, falling?
Could you feel me fall?
Could you feel me falling, falling?
Could you feel me fall?
Could you feel me falling, falling? (I guess I'm)
Could you feel me fall?
Could you feel me falling, falling? (I guess I'm terrified)
Could you feel me fall?

Baby, I'm looking at you but I'm terrified
Maybe I know that you'd been so damn hard to find (Hard to find)
I've been waiting all my life for ya (Waiting all my life)
Every night I wanna die for ya
I don't never wanna cry for ya
Need you to stay
Baby, I'm looking at you and I'm terrified (Terrified)

Could you feel me falling, falling?
Could you feel me fall? (Could you feel me fall?)
Could you feel me falling, falling?
Could you feel me fall? (Could you feel me fall?)
Could you feel me falling, falling? (I guess I'm)
Could you feel me fall? (Could you feel me fall?)
Could you feel me falling, falling? (I guess I'm terrified)
Could you feel me fall? (Could you feel me fall?)

// The Exchange //

Came across a picture of you and her online
She looks at you like she knows that you're bored out of your mind
I'm wrapped up in his arms
Feeling perfectly alone
But I know there's been a mix-up
Because I wish his hands were yours

So come closer, closer
Darling, I thought of a plan
Let me whisper, whisper
So that you can understand
We'll be dressed in, dressed in
All black from head to toe
Only we'll know, only we'll know

I think we should trade
Cupid told me he was drunk that day
And so he shot two arrows the wrong way
I heard him say
I think we should trade
We'll tell him let's go on a double date
And meet us up at six in the cafe
We'll run away
And call it the exchange

Blink twice if it's true
But do you think about it too (you, you do)
You said you're running out with her
It tells me that you do (I know that you do)
There's beats that I've been skippin'
When my head is on your chest (you, you do)
And you know if it were us two
It'd be cardiac arrest

So come closer, closer
Darling, I thought of a plan
Let me whisper, whisper
So that you can understand
We'll be dressed in, dressed in
All black from head to toe
Only we'll know, only we'll know, woah

I think we should trade
Cupid told me he was drunk that day
And so he shot two arrows the wrong way
I heard him say

Now that you know it's true, know it's true
There's nothing like me and you
And you've been trying to say it ain't true, but it's starving me how I look at you
I know that you know it's true, know it's true
There's nothing like me and you
And you've been trying to say it ain't true, but it's starving me how I love you
I know that you know it's true, know it's true
There's nothing like me and you
And you've been trying to say it ain't true, but it's starving me how I look at you
I know that you know
There's nothing like me and you

I think we should trade
We'll tell him we'll go on a double date
And meet us up at six in the cafe
We'll run away
What do you say we run away?
We'll call it the exchange

// Thief Looks Like An Angel //

You came in like an angel
And everything was looking right, oh yeah
I got my heart on the table
Got me high like it was Heaven-sent

It was midnight, he was a goner
Got no answer, I tried to call ya
Saw the headlights, I knew I lost ya
Stole my kisses, it's gonna cost ya

Thief looks like an angel
I saw it coming but he blinded me
Now I see a different angle
He came and took it like a robbery
Oh no, no-no, no-no
Running in circles, running in circles
Thief looks like an angel
I tried to catch him but he got away

Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away

He walked out like a monster
Left a cold pillow in my bed
Red handed, I caught ya
But you got enough in his hand

It was midnight, he was a goner
Got no answer, I tried to call ya
Saw the headlights, I knew I lost ya
Stole my kisses, it's gonna cost ya

Thief looks like an angel
I saw it coming but he blinded me
Now I see a different angle
He came and took it like a robbery
Oh no, no-no, no-no
Running in circles, running in circles
Thief looks like an angel
I tried to catch him but he got away

Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away

Thief looks like an angel
I saw it coming but he blinded me
Now I see a different angle
He came and took it like a robbery
Oh no, no-no, no-no
Running in circles, running in circles
Thief looks like an angel
I tried to catch him but he got away

Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away

// U Shaped Space //

I woke up just to miss ya
I woke up just to check if my phone would start to whisper
You said you needed time so I made the clock move quicker
Honestly, you were my only friend
I hate to say I need ya
Look for you in everyone and all it does it feed the
Urge to call you up so I made myself delete ya
Jenny said it's the right thing to do

Tell me is it
Loud where you are dear?
There's a silence here
Where are you anymore? (oh-oh)

'Cause there's a u shaped space where your hands used to be
Baby, there's a pillowcase where you lay next to me
It's 3 AM, you know, I know, can't cure the vacancy
Oh baby, baby there's a u shaped space where your hands used to be

Tell me is it
Loud where you are dear?
There's a silence here
Where are you anymore?

'Cause there's a u shaped space where your hands used to be
Baby, there's a pillowcase where you lay next to me
It's 3 AM, you know, I know, can't cure the vacancy
Oh baby, baby there's a u shaped space where your hands used to be

'Cause there's a u shaped space where your hands used to be
Baby, there's a pillowcase where you lay next to me
It's 3 AM, you know, I know, can't cure the vacancy
Oh baby, baby there's a u shaped space where your hands used to be
