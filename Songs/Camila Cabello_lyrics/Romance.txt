Album: Romance

// Shameless //

Don't speak, no, don't try
It's been a secret for the longest time
Don't run, huh, no don't hide
Been running from it for the longest time

So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind

Right now I'm shameless
Screaming my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to

(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)

It's all there, now it's real
Now that you have me, do you want me still?
My kisses are history they go back a long time
Uh, and I'm tired of loving
Somebody that's not mine

So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind

Right now I'm shameless
Screaming my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to

(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)

Distance, inches in between us
I want you to give in
I want you to give in
Weakness, tension in between us
I just wanna give in
And I don't care if I'm forgiven

Right now I'm shameless
Screaming my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to
Show me you're shameless
Write it on my neck, why don't ya?
And I won't erase it
I need you more than I want to
Need you more than I want to

(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)
(No uh, no uh, don't wanna do this now)

// Living Proof //

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, I promise
Ooh

Tell me something, but say it with your hands, slow
When you touch me, paint me like a Van Gogh (Oh)
I wanna study every inch of you
'Til you trust me to make the angels come through

Like a choir singing "Hallelujah"
When my body's crashin' right into you
When we align, ooh yeah
Do you feel me?
Can you feel me?
'Cause I can't breathe

Where did you come from, baby?
And were you sent to save me?
Ooh, there's God in every move
Ooh, and you're the living proof (Oh)
The way your hands can shake me
Soft to the touch like baby
Ooh, there's God in every move
Ooh, and you're the living proof (Oh)

Count the freckles, as they run down your spine
Show your demons, and I might show you mine
One at a time, yeah, yeah, what are you hidin'?
What a design, yeah, yeah, I wanna dive in
What a divine moment
Can you feel me? (Oh)
Can you feel me? (Oh)
'Cause I can't breathe

Where did you come from, baby?
And were you sent to save me?
Ooh, there's God in every move
Ooh, and you're the living proof (Oh)
The way your hands can shake me
Soft to the touch like baby
Ooh, there's God in every move
Ooh, and you're the living proof (Oh)

Like a choir singing "Hallelujah"
Ooh yeah, choir singing "Hallelujah"
Like a choir singing "Hallelujah"
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Choir singing "Hallelujah"
Body's crashin' right into you (Oh)
Do you feel me?
Can you feel me?
'Cause I can't breathe (Oh)

Where did you come from, baby?
And were you sent to save me? (Oh)
Ooh, there's God in every move
Ooh, and you're the living proof (Oh)
The way your hands can shake me
Soft to the touch like baby
Ooh, there's God in every move (Ooh)
Ooh, and you're the living proof (Oh)

Like a choir singing "Hallelujah" (Baby, babe)
Ooh yeah, choir singing "Hallelujah" (Baby, babe)
Like a choir singing "Hallelujah," (Ooh) "Hallelujah" (Ooh)
And you're the living proof (Oh)

// Should've Said It //

So you want me now? That's funny
'Cause you didn't give a - back then
Comin' back around, so sorry
'Cause there's no room in my bed
And I'm all good now, someone else is gettin' all of me (Ah)
If you wanted me so desperately, you should've said it

Show up at my door but I don't live there anymore
Sendin' me your songs but they don't really sound like before
I was crazy for you, all caught up and confused (Ah)
Love was broken for me, now it's broken for you

You're only lonely, now you ain't the one to hold me
Only lonely now

So you want me now? That's funny
'Cause you didn't give a - back then
Comin' back around, so sorry
'Cause there's no room in my bed
And I'm all good now, someone else is gettin' all of me (Ah)
If you wanted me so desperately, you should've said it

Isn't it somethin' that I get more when I'm givin' you nothin' (Huh)
Isn't it magic, that when you stop lookin' for it, it happens (Oh)
Baby, he fell from grace, landed right in your place
Kissed me so many times, that I forgot your taste

You're only lonely, now you ain't the one to hold me
Only lonely now, now

So you want me now? That's funny
'Cause you didn't give a - back then
Comin' back around, so sorry
'Cause there's no room in my bed
And I'm all good now, someone else is gettin' all of me (Ah)
If you wanted me so desperately, you should've said it
You should've said it, love
Should've said it
Should've said it, love

I wish that you could turn back the time
You'd hold me closer instead of your pride (Oh, oh)
I knew it was you from the very first night
And it took you two years to make up your mind

So you want me now? That's funny
'Cause you didn't give a - back then
Comin' back around, so sorry (Ayy)
'Cause there's no room in my bed
And I'm all good now, someone else is gettin' all of me (Ah)
If you wanted me so desperately, you should've said it
You should've said it, love
Should've said it
You should've said it, love

So you want me now, now baby
So you want me now, now baby
So you want me now, no
You should've said it, should've said it, love

// My Oh My //

(My oh my)
He comes alive at midnight
(Every night)
My mama doesn't trust him
(My oh my)
He's only here for one thing but
(So am I)

Yeah, a little bit older
A black leather jacket
A bad reputation
Insatiable habits

That girl know what she want, she make me take it off when she see me (Let's go)
She say I make her wet whenever my face pop up on TV
I had to say, "No disrespect, gotta do it safe or you can keep it"
Pop star, I'm fresh up out the trap and I'm goin' Bieber
She know I'ma call away, she can drop a pin and I'd come meet her
Stand next to me, you gon' end up catchin' a fever
I'm hot (Yeah)

// Señorita //

I love it when you call me SeÃ±orita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya

Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la
Yeah, no

Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila Sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la
Yeah

I love it when you call me SeÃ±orita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it

When you call me SeÃ±orita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya

Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say, "We're just friends."
But friends don't know the way you taste-la-la-la
'Cause you know it's been a long time comin'
Don't you let me fall, oh

Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop

I love it when you call me SeÃ±orita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it

When you call me SeÃ±orita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya

All along I'll be coming for ya (for ya)
And I hope it meant something to ya
Call my name, I'll be comin' for ya (comin' for ya)
Comin' for ya (comin' for ya)

For ya, for ya (oh, she loves it when I call her), for ya
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya

// Liar //

I don't care if you're here
Or if you're not alone
I don't care, it's been too long
It's kinda like it didn't happen
The way that your lips move
The way you whisper slow
I don't care, it's good as gone

Uh, I said I won't lose control
I don't want it
I said I won't get too close
But I can't stop it

Oh no, there you go
Making me a liar
Got me begging you for more
Oh no, there I go
Startin' up a fire
Oh no, no
Oh no, there you go
Making me a liar
I kinda like it though
Oh no, there I go
Startin' up a fire
Oh no, no

They're watching, I feel it
I know I shouldn't stay
I picture your hands on me
(I think I wanna let it happen)
But what if you kiss me?
And what if I like it?
And no one sees it

I said I won't lose control
I don't want it
I said I won't get too close
But I can't stop it

Oh no, there you go
Making me a liar
Got me begging you for more
Oh no, there I go
Startin' up a fire
Oh no, no
Oh no, there you go
Making me a liar
I kinda like it though
Oh no, there I go
Startin' up a fire
Oh no, no

Oh no, no, no
Here comes trouble, no, no
Startin' up a fire

I don't believe myself when I
Say that I don't need you
I don't believe myself when I
Say it, so don't believe me

Oh no, there you go
Making me a liar
Got me begging you for more
Oh no, there I go
Startin' up a fire
Oh no, no
Oh no, there you go
Making me a liar
I kinda like it though
Oh no, there I go
Startin' up a fire
Oh no, no

(Yeah, nah, yeah, nah)
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, you're making me a liar
'Cause your clothes are on the floor
Another fire

// Bad Kind Of Butterflies //

Come here and sit next to me
Don't look at me while I'm breaking
After what I'm gonna say
I understand if you hate me

What do I do when I love you and want somebody else?
What do I lose if I don't choose and keep it to myself?

I got bad, bad, bad kinda butterflies
Like when you got something to hide
Lies, telling you that I'm alright tonight, tonight
Bad, bad, butterflies in my chest
There's something I gotta confess
Yes, somebody's stuck in my head and I, and I

I know I said we were friends
And when I said that, I meant it (Swear I meant it)
Somewhere between now and then
It became more than just a friendship

What do I do when I love you and want somebody else?
What do I lose if I don't choose and keep it to myself?

I got bad, bad, bad kinda butterflies
Like when you got something to hide
Lies, telling you that I'm alright tonight, tonight
Bad, bad, butterflies in my chest
There's something I gotta confess
Yes, somebody's stuck in my head and I, and I

Come here and sit next to me
You tell me baby, just say it (Say it, say it)
Warning me, it's a mistake
I just know I gotta make it

And I got bad, bad, bad kinda butterflies
Like when you got something to hide
Lies, telling you that I'm alright tonight, tonight
Bad, bad, butterflies in my chest
There's something I gotta confess
There's somebody stuck in my head and I, and I

// Easy //

You tell me that I'm complicated
And that might be an understatement
Anything else?
You tell me that I'm indecisive
Fickle but I try to hide it
Anything else?
You tell me that I overthink
'Til I ruin a good thing
Anything else?
You tell me that you'd rather fight
Than spend a single peaceful night
With somebody else

You really, really know me
The future and the old me
All of the mazes and the madness in my mind
You really, really love me
You know me and you love me
And it's the kind of thing I always hoped I'd find (yeah)

Always thought I was hard to love 'til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Always thought I was hard to love 'til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Touch me 'til I find myself in a feeling
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving no
Always thought I was hard to love 'til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy

I never liked my crooked teeth
You tell me they are your favorite thing
Anything else?
Stretch marks all around my thighs
Kiss 'em 'til I change my mind
About everything else

You really, really know me
The future and the old me
All of the mazes and the madness in my mind
You really, really love me
You know me and you love me
And it's the kind of thing I always hoped I'd find

Always thought I was hard to love 'til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Always thought I was hard to love 'til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Touch me 'til I find myself in a feeling
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving (never)
Always thought I was hard to love 'til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy

All I know is you heal me when I'm broken, heal me when I'm broken, ah
All I know is you save me and you know it, save me and you know it

Always thought I was hard to love 'til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
I always thought I was hard to love 'til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
('Til you made it, 'til you made it)
Touch me 'til I find myself in a feeling
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving
Always thought I was hard to love 'til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy

// Feel It Twice //

Oh I'm scared if I look in your eyes, I might see your soul
I know love is the loneliest place when you fall alone
Sittin' by the phone, holdin' on to hope
Spendin' all night wonderin' why you let me go
I wish you had felt how you're feelin' two years ago
Oh ah

Hurts me to hurt you baby
Lying awake, and everything has changed
Keeping our distance lately
Kills me to kill you when I tell you
That I felt it once, I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take baby
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same

I can feel you still staring at me when I look away
Can't imagine the pain that you feel when I kiss his face
That's when you said
How can I be your friend
When I know the way you taste
It's almost 2am
And I can't ask you to stay
I don't know what's worse
Gettin' broken or makin' it break
Oh ah

Hurts me to hurt you baby
Lying awake, and everything has changed
Keeping our distance lately
Kills me to kill you when I tell you
That I felt it once, I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take baby
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same

Hurts me to hurt you babe
Feels like there's nothin' I can say
Hurts me to hurt you babe
Kills me, I have to walk away
'Cause I felt it once, I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take, baby
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same

The same
Oh the same
Oh the same
Oh oh the same
Oh...

// Dream Of You //

He's a bad dancer
He's a right answer
He's a shy singer
Most of the time
Unless it's him and I
He's an over-thinker
He's a slow kisser
A confessed sinner
All of the time
When it's him and I

And you squeeze my hands two times, three times
And believe me, I'll love you always, always

All I do the whole day through is dream of you
All I do since I met you is dream of you
So, could you stay with me, lay with me talking 'bout nothing
All I do the whole day through is dream of you

I was not living
I was just writing about it
With my head spinning
Days passing by most of the time, yeah

And you squeeze my hands two times, three times
And believe me, I'll love you always, always

All I do the whole day through is dream of you
All I do since I met you is dream of you
So, could you stay with me, lay with me talking 'bout nothing
All I do the whole day through is dream of you

I dream of you, I dream of you
I dream of you, yeah, only you
I dream of you, yeah, only you
I dream of you, oh

Please say you dream of me too
Can you please say you dream of me too

Oh woah woah

All I do the whole day through is dream of you
All I do since I met you is dream of you
So, could you stay with me, lay with me talking 'bout nothing
All I do the whole day through is dream of you

I dream of you, I dream of you
I dream of you, yeah, only you
I dream of you, yeah, only you
I dream of you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

All I do the whole day through is dream of you

// Cry For Me //

Yeah, and you look so happy walking down the street, don't you babe
Did you forget, you said that in this lifetime you could never get over me
Are you over me? (Uh)

When I said, "I hope you're happy" didn't mean it
Never thought you'd be so good at moving on
When I'm lying wide awake you're probably sleeping
And maybe what I'm thinking is wrong

I want you to cry for me, cry for me
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me
And if you can't then maybe lie for me, lie for me
'Cause you haunt me when I'm dreaming
And it's time you know the feeling
So cry for me

See that pretty life in pictures
See, your lips erasing me
You're so good to her it's vicious
Yeah, she should be thanking me
Ooh, who's gonna touch you like me?
Yeah, tell me who
Who could make you forget about me?

When I said, "I hope you're happy" didn't mean it
Never thought you'd be so good at moving on
When I'm lying wide awake you're probably sleeping
And maybe what I'm thinking is wrong

I want you to cry for me, cry for me
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me
And if you can't then maybe lie for me, lie for me
'Cause you haunt me when I'm dreaming
And it's time you know the feeling
So baby, won't you cry for me, cry for me
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me
And if you can't then maybe lie for me, lie for me
'Cause you haunt me when I'm dreaming
And it's time you know the feeling
So cry for me

(Why won't you cry, oh?)
(Tears in my eyes, yeah)
(And you're okay, you're okay)
(How can you be okay?)
(No, why won't you cry?)

I want you to cry for me, cry for me
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me
And if you can't then maybe lie for me, lie for me
'Cause you haunt me when I'm dreaming
And it's time you know the feeling
So baby, won't you cry for me, cry for me
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me
And if you can't then maybe lie for me, lie for me
'Cause you haunt me when I'm dreaming
And it's time you know the feeling
So cry for me

Cry for me

// This Love //

No, no, no

Know just how to make me miss ya
When I'm feeling sentimental
Going in our separate ways
But wind up back here in the middle
Losing you I couldn't face
But to love you is worse
Waiting for you just in case
One day it doesn't hurt, na, na, na

Said it's the last time but na, na, na, na
Just like the last time yeah, na, na, na, na
Tired of building up my walls yeah
Just to watch them fall again

So fuck this love, calling my name
Get out of my veins
If you need your space then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up then make it okay
I guess that's just your game
And I'm the one who gets played
Again and again and again and again

Maybe you should set me free
Maybe I don't really want you to
Maybe I just wanna be
Be the person that you just can't lose
If you're gonna leave then go
If you need me let me know
Love me or just let me go, but no

Na, na, na
Said it's the last time but na, na, na, na
Just like the last time yeah, na, na, na, na
Tired of building up my walls yeah
Just to watch them fall again

(Fuck) this love, calling my name
Get out of my veins
If you need your space then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up then make it okay
I guess that's just your game
And I'm the one who gets played
Again and again and again and again

Maybe you should set me free
Maybe I don't really want you to
Maybe I just wanna be
Be the person that you just can't lose, no
There I go and fall again

(Fuck) this love, calling my name
Get out of my veins
If you need your space then just walk away
You know how to fuck me up then make it okay
I guess that's just your game
And I'm the one who gets played
Again and again and again and again and again

Oh, again
Oh, no
Here I go again

// Used To This //

No, I never liked San Francisco
Never thought it was nothing special
Till you kissed me there
No, I never liked windy cities
But I think maybe when you're with me
I like everywhere

It's the strangest feeling
Midnight, I'm not leaving
No, for once, I think I'll stay
I say your name, just listen
Doesn't it sound different
Never whispered it this way

It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
The feeling of your fingertips
The feeling of another kiss
It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
Like every tattoo on your skin
I'm memorizing every inch
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
Definitely

No, I never did like tequila
But there's something about when I see ya
Think I need a drink
And the callouses on your fingers
I admire them from a distance
Now they're on my cheek

Oh, I've known you forever
Now I know you better
Let's just get carried away, oh
And it bears repeating
How hard my heart's beating
When you tell me I should stay

It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
The feeling of your fingertips
The feeling of another kiss
It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
Like every tattoo on your skin
I'm memorizing every inch
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
Definitely

No, I never liked San Francisco
Never thought it was nothing special
Till you kissed me there

It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
The feeling of your fingertips
The feeling of another kiss
It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
Like every tattoo on your skin
I'm memorizing every inch
I could get used to this

I feel it all (I could get used to this)
Your kisses, oh, I'll risk it all
Seventeen when we started to fall (I could get used to this)
But we lost it all
And I just can't believe it all (I could get used to this)
Definitely

// First Man //

Yes, I'm gonna stay with him tonight
I'll see you in the morning
No, of course, he won't drink and drive
Can you say bye to mom for me?
Oh you'll like him, he's really kind
And he's funny - like you sometimes
And I found someone I really like
Maybe for the first time

No, I don't need a jacket
It's not that cold tonight
And you worry, I get it
But he's waiting outside

I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I know you'll stay up late just waiting for me
You held me so tight now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me

Now you're driving to the airport
Not just me you pick up anymore
I've got eight days off coming up
And I can only come home for four

Yeah I just met his family
They're just like you and mom
He makes me really happy
I think he might be the one, oh

I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I promise he loves me, he'd never hurt me
You held me so tight now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me
Now you're on the driveway faking a smile
You wish you could tell him he doesn't deserve me
So I had to stop the car and turn around
To tell you, "You were the first man that really loved me."

And before they open up the doors
I say, "I've never seen you cry before."
You say, "You've never looked so beautiful
You know you'll always be my little girl"

You're looking at me, we're walking down the aisle
With tears in your eyes, maybe he deserves me
You don't even know how much it means to me now
That you were the first man that really loved me

Oh, that really loved me, oh
You really love me
