// Rhythm Nation / You Gotta Be //

Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm nation
Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm nation
People of the world today are looking for a better way of life
We are a part of the rhythm nation
We are a part of the rhythm nation

Looking for a better way of life
We are a part, we are a part, we are a part of the rhythm nation

Listen as your day unfolds
Challenge what the future holds
Try and keep your head up to the sky
Others, they may cause you tears, go ahead release your fears
Stand up and be counted, 'cause you wanna let you try

You gotta be, you gotta be bad, you gotta be bold, you gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, gotta keep it together
All I know, all I know love will save the day
All I know, all I know love will save the day

We are a part of the rhythm nation

Time asks no questions, it goes on without you (Without you)
Leaving you behind, if you can't stand the pace (Can't stand the pace)
The world keeps on spinning, can't stop it if you try to
The best part is dangerous, staring you in the face

You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold, you gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, gotta keep it together
All I know, all I know love will save the day

You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold, you gotta, gotta, gotta be wiser
You gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta, gotta, gotta be stronger
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm, gotta, gotta keep it together
All I know, all I know, all I know
You gotta be cool, and calm, so strong

'Cause we are a part of the rhythm nation
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming of the better way, a better way of life, of life
(We are a part of the rhythm nation)
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is love will save the day

// Million To One //

Here I go again
I'm imagining a world outside unlike the one I'm in
Daydreamin' again of when I'll get a chance
There's a world that understands
Where you don't hear the whispers in the room you're walkin' in
Daydreamin' again, all I need is a chance

When I feel my fear staring at me
I tell it just wait and see
I know who I'm gonna be
I know who I'm gonna be
The world's half-asleep
It's gonna wake up and see

If it's a million to one
I'm gonna be that one and
If it's a shot in the dark
I'm gonna be the sun
And I just can't afford to be wrong
Even when I'm afraid
You're gonna know my name
Yeah you're gonna know my name

I can barely sleep
'Cause my heart is always racing, chasing, pacing 'round the room
Livin' carefully is something I don't wanna do

When I feel my fear staring at me
I tell it just wait and see
I know who I'm gonna be
I know who I'm gonna be
The world's half-asleep
It's gonna wake up and see

If it's a million to one
I'm gonna be that one and
If it's a shot in the dark
I'm gonna be the sun
And I just can't afford to be wrong
Even when I'm afraid
You're gonna know my name
Yeah you're gonna know my name

And I can see her now and then
The one I know that I could be, yeah
I see her laughin', 'cause she knew all along in her head
So when the light is hard to see
She's telling me

If it's a million to one
I'm gonna be that one and
If it's a shot in the dark
I'm gonna be the sun
And I just can't afford to be wrong (No no no no no no)
Even when I'm afraid (Even when I'm afraid)
You're gonna know my name
You're gonna know my name (Oh)

You're gonna know my name
You're gonna know my name, yeah
You're gonna know my name
You're gonna know my name

// The New Barry //

Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye
Ay, hear ye
I'm the new town crier, yeah, I took over for Barry
I know you'll miss him, but he died of dysentery
So now I'm here with the announcements of the day
Got my band beside me, I know you like the way they play
Today we got news for you ladies and gents
A changin' of the guard is soon to commence
But this one is special, better than the shire fair
Because this time, the whole royal family will be there (Oh yeah)
King Rowan, of course, and our Queen Beatrice
And their fancy royal robes, you don't want to miss
Prince Robert with the hair, Princess Gwen no doubt
See the new guards come in and old roll out
Yeah

// Somebody To Love //

Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doin' to me (Yeah, yeah)
I have spent all my years in believin' you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

Somebody (Somebody)
Somebody (Somebody)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

I work hard
(He works hard)
Every day of my life
I work 'til I ache my bones
At the end of the day
I'm all on my own
I get down (Down) on my knees (Knees)
And I start to pray (Praise the Lord)
'Til the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

Somebody (Somebody)
Somebody (Somebody)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
(Somebody)
(Somebody)

I work hard
(He works hard)
Everyday of my life (Everyday)
I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
I got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe

Find
Me
Somebody to love
Find
Me
Somebody to love
Find (Find me somebody)

(Some one to love)

// Material Girl //

Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (That's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mister Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

(But what about romance? Oh please, listen up)

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest, then I have to let them be
Some boys try, and some boys lie
But I don't let them play (No way)
Only boys who save their penny make my rainy day

'Cause they are living in a material world
And I am a material girl (Get it?)
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
Living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

// Shot At The Crown //

Hey
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye
You need to hear this
Yeah

Gather round, heed my call
In two weeks there'll be a ball
And not just any ball, it's like a change of life
It's time the prince finally find his wife
That's right, single ladies you should be getting excited
Because every single one to the ball is invited
So tip off, do your hair, buy a fancy new dress
Paint your nails, you got a prince to impress
Yes, it's gonna be magic, yo, uh
So don't be tragic, yo, uh
Don't be a sad chick, yo, uh
Call yourself under-qualified, nah
Throw on a gown, y'all, uh
For a shot at the crown, y'all, uh
And prepare to get down, y'all, uh
As Prince Robert chooses his bride

// Am I Wrong //

Am I wrong for thinkin' out the box from where I stay?
Am I wrong for sayin' that I choose another way?
I ain't tryin' to do what everybody else doin'
Just 'cause everybody doin' what they all do
If one thing I know, how far would I'll grow
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home

So, am I wrong?
For thinkin' that we could be something for real?
(Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no, it's wrong)
Now, am I wrong?
For tryin' to reach the things that I can't see? (Ooh)
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
Trying to reach the things that I can't see

Am I trippin', am I, for having a vision?
My prediction, I'ma be on top of the world
Hope you, hope you don't look back
Always do what you decide
Don't let them control your life
That's just how I feel, ooh
Fight for yours and don't let go
Don't let them compare you, no
Don't worry, you're not alone
That's just how I feel (That's just how I feel)
That's just how I feel

If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right, right
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right (I don't wanna be right)
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong (If you tell me I'm wrong)
I don't wanna be right, right (I don't wanna be right)
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong (If you tell me I'm wrong)
I don't wanna be right

Am I wrong? (Am I wrong, am I wrong?)
For thinkin' that we could be something for real? (For real, for real)
Now am I wrong? (Am I wrong, am I wrong?)
For tryin' to reach the things that I can't see? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
That's just how I feel
Tryin' to reach the things that I can't see

Am I wrong?
For thinkin' that we could be something for real? Oh...
Now am I wrong?
For tryin' to reach the things that I can't see?

// Million To One (Reprise) //

When I feel my fears staring at me
I tell it just wait and see
I know who I'm gonna be
I know who I'm gonna
The worlds half asleep

I'm gonna be that one and
If it's a shot in the dark
I'm gonna be the sun
And I just can't afford to be wrong
Even when I'm afraid
You're gonna know my name
You're gonna know my name, yeah
You're gonna know my name
You're gonna know my...

// Whatta Man / Seven Nation Army //

Yeah
Ooh yeah
Ooh, uh
Hey, alright

Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Gotta say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes, he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man

I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said/she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cause we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
(Ha ha ha) You so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby

Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes, he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
You gotta say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man

I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Like I'm in a minuet
And the message coming from my eyes
Says "Leave it alone"

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la

And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you

La la la la la la la
(Whatta man whatta man, whatta mighty good man)
La la la la la la la la la
(Whatta mighty good man whatta man, whatta mighty good man)

And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
(Whatta man, whatta man, whatta mighty good man)
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
(Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man, whatta mighty mighty mighty mighty mighty good man
Whatta man whatta man whatta man whatta man)

Whatta man!

// Perfect //

I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a boy, beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we may be kids
But we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
(Be my man)
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And you look perfect
I don't deserve this
(I don't deserve this)
You look perfect... tonight

// Perfect (Reprise) //

I found a love...

I found a boy...

// Dream Girl //

I don't care, this is life
It's not fair, it's not right
All that hope and that pride
It's a waste, it's a lie
All you want is to breathe
Little girls should run free
But your corset's too tight
And your heels are too high

This treasure you've found, bury it
The only way out, marry it
That shadow of doubt, carry it
Carry it down to your grave
The world doesn't need another dream girl
The world doesn't need another dream girl

You're too dumb, you're too young
Full of heart, so naÃ¯ve
You're so blind, you're so green
You'll give up, just like me
The wings ornamental
They have no intention of letting you fly
Don't be sentimental
Some legends are born in the wrong time

This treasure you've found (Bury it)
The only way out (Marry it)
That shadow of doubt (Carry it)
Carry it down to your grave

(Bury it, marry it, carry it)
Carry it down to your grave (Marry it)
Your grave (Marry it), your grave (Carry it)

(Bury it) bury it, (Marry it) marry it, (Carry it) carry it
(The world doesn't need another dream girl)
(Bury it) bury it, (Marry it) marry it, (Carry it) carry it
(The world doesn't need another dream girl)
(Bury it) bury it, (Marry it) marry it, (Carry it) carry it
Carry it down to your grave (Your grave, your grave)

The world doesn't need another dream girl

// Shoe Made Of Glass //

Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye
If you don't know yet, you won't believe
What I'm about to tell
But our handsome young prince at the ball
Well, he fell for a pretty young lady
I hear quite the stunner
Who then turned out to be
Uh-huh, quite the runner

See, at the end of the night
This woman split so fast
She left no name
No I.D. just a shoe made of glass
And now he's looking
For the girl
With the other glass slipper
No buckles, no laces
Not even a zipper

The shoe
The shoe, does it look like this?

That's a dirty old boot, lady, swing and a miss

It's hard for me to tell, could my foot be right?

Your foot's the size of a canoe, ma'am, way too tight

How unfortunate for me that I birthed
Ten sons...

That is too bad
But I like those vocal runs

'Ey, 'ey, 'ey
People, look, it ain't me who needs convincing
I ain't the one with the ring-a-ding-ding
Go home, get your girls in the shoe that goes bling
And don't show it to me, tell it to your future king

// Million To One / Could Have Been Me (Reprise) //

If it's a million to one

If it's a million to one
I wanna taste love and pain
If it's a shot in the dark
I wanna feel pride and shame
And I just can't afford to be wrong
I don't wanna take my time
Even when I'm afraid
Don't wanna waste one line
Could have been me
You're gonna know my name
Don't wanna live as an untold story
You're gonna know my
You're gonna know my name
Rather go out in a blaze of glory
You're gonna know my (know my)

// Let's Get Loud //

Let's get loud...

Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up, let's do it
Come on people, let's get loud
Let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud
Let's get loud, let's get loud

Ain't nobody gotta tell ya what you gotta do
If you wanna live your life
Live it all the way, and don't you waste it (Don't you waste it no)
Every feeling, every beat
Can be so very sweet, you gotta taste it (You gotta taste it)

// Million To One (Remix) //

Here I go again
I'm imagining a world outside unlike the one I'm in
Daydreamin' again of when I'll get a chance
There's a world that understands
Where you don't hear the whispers in the room you're walkin' in
Daydreamin' again, all I need is a chance

When I feel my fears staring at me
I tell it just wait and see
I know who I'm gonna be
I know who I'm gonna be

If it's a shot in the dark
I'm gonna be the sun
And I just can't afford to be wrong
Even when I'm afraid
You're gonna know my name
You're gonna know my name

I can barely sleep
'Cause my heart is always racing, chasing, pacing 'round the room
Livin' carefully is something I don't wanna do, huh

When I feel my fears staring at me
I tell it just wait and see
I know who I'm gonna be
I know who I'm gonna be
The worlds half asleep
It's gonna wake up and see

If it's a million to one

// Dream Girl (Nile Rodgers Remix) //

The world doesn't need another dream girl
The world doesn't need another dream girl

I don't care, this is life
It's not fair, it's not right
All that hope and that pride
It's a waste, it's a lie
All you want is to breathe
Little girls should run free
But your corset is too tight
And your heels are too high

This treasure you found bury it
The only way out marry it
That shadow of doubt carry it
Carry it down to your grave
The world doesn't need another dream girl
The world doesn't need another dream girl

You're too dumb, you're too young
Full of heart, so naive
You're so blind, you're so green
You'll give up, just like me
The wings are ornamental
They have no intention of letting you fly
Don't be sentimental
Some legends are born in a wrong time

This treasure you found (Bury it)
The only way out (Marry it)
That shadow of doubt (Carry it)
Carry it down to your grave

(Marry it) marry it (Carry it)
Carry it down to your grave (Marry it)
Your grave, your grave (Marry it, carry it)

Carry it down to your grave (Your grave, your grave, your grave)
Down to your damn grave

There's no way out, no, we don't have a choice
Let always win and let reuse our voice
Don't you know you're living
Don't you know you're living
Don't you know you're living, without choice
The world doesn't need another dream girl
The world doesn't need another dream girl
Another dream girl
The world doesn't need another dream girl
