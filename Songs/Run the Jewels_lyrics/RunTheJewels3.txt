// Down //

[Killer Mike:]
I hope (I hope)
I hope with the highest of hopes
That I never have to go back to the trap
And my days of dealing with dope
So I, I only spit fire and dope
So later on you can go quote
My lines to your people and folk
And they say damn (damn)
That boy be spitting that pressure (pressure)
And he be smoking that pressure (pressure)
And he smart as a professor (yessir)
25 lighters on dresser, pound of that pressure
Sittin right next to (next to)
Next to a book and a gun
Ballot or bullet, you better use one
One time for the freedom of speeches (speech)
Two time for the right to hold heaters (heaters)
Just skip to the fifth if the cops in your house
Close your mouth and pray to your Jesus
Ask why cause the Devil a lie (lie)
So I stay holy and high (high)
May never get rich, but I never bitch
'Cause I made it here by and by

My, my, y'all
I coulda died, y'all
A couple times I took my eyes off the prize, y'all
I know a few people pray for my demise, y'all
But like cream, I had to rise, I had to rise, y'all
Oh my, y'all
I coulda died, y'all
A couple times, I took my eyes off the prize, y'all
I know a couple people pray for my demise, y'all
But even birds with broken wings want to fly, y'all

[El-P:]
You're gonna need a bigger boat, boys, you're in trouble
Gonna need a little hope, boys, on the double
You muckin' with a G here, here see talk to me
Or maybe listen to the man that barely dodged his own lobotomy
Pop the tape in baby, we got shit we wrote for you
Came from feeling what a pure absence of hope can do
Only to leap through flaming rings and break the nose of crews
Still in their wings'll be them darlin's hope they've broken you
(Yeah, they better hope that) I'm a full force full and a cold fact
See the cold floor, where I licked dirt
Where the dough dried and the pride died
Had a dub max, had to shop right
Gimme two meals and the lights on
I'ma do right, get a new crew
Make a new life, never boo hoo
Never lose sight, I'm a true dude
With a burst heart from a old soul
Better stop, drop when the squad's hot, we don't stop a lot
We don't talk a lot about it, we just pop it off a lot
I'm high, man, I'm a cosmonaut
Scream, "Fuck 'em," 'til they lop our bloody noggins off
I promise y'all

My, my, y'all
I coulda died, y'all
A couple times I took my eyes off the prize, y'all
I know a few people pray for my demise, y'all
But like cream, I had to rise, I had to rise, y'all
Oh my, y'all
I coulda died, y'all
A couple times, I took my eyes off the prize, y'all
I know a couple people pray for my demise, y'all
But even birds with broken wings want to fly, y'all

// Talk To Me //

[Killer Mike:]
We return from the depths of the badland
With a gun and a knife in our waistband
Went to war with the devil and shaytan
He wore a bad toupee and a spray tan
So high now, hoping that I land
On a Thai stick moving through Thailand
On the radio heard a plane hijack
Government be in debt while they cook crack
I move in a world of conspiracies
Obey no rules, I'm doing me
Smoke kush, transport to the airport
Customs found a joint in my passport
Pull cash and I gave him what he asked for
God damnit it's a motherfucking miracle
Small bribe, made it back into America
Hit Uber and maneuvered out the area
Rhyme animal, pitbull terrier
Rap terrorist, terrorize, tear it up
Brought gas and the matches to flare it up
Militant Michael might go psycho
On any ally or rival
Born black, that's dead on arrival
My job is to fight for survival
In spite of these all lives matter ass white folk

[Interlude:]
This is spiritual warfare that you have been dealing with. This is not a fight that you have been dealing with flesh and blood but this is a fight against principalities and evil doers and unclean spirits. (RTJ3 motherfuckers)

[El-P:]
Brave men didn't die face down in the Vietnam mud so I could not style on you
I didn't walk uphill both ways to the booth and back to not wile on you
You think baby Jesus killed Hitler just so I'd whisper?
When you're safe and sound and these crooks tap your phone and now have a file on you?
What me worry? Nah buddy, I've lost before, so what?
You don't get it, I'm dirt, motherfucker, I can't be crushed
Fuckers open the books up and stop bullshitting the kid
My dick got a mission to storm on par with the best ever took the gig
I'ma super cat, from don dada to dusk, don't bother to touch
I got firm clutch on the grip and the pumps
I might ghost ride a tank, take a ride to the bank
Got the son of Rick Rubin rushing full thrust
Don't flash weak shit to the Shark Tank judge
Talk real good cause I'm smart and stuff
We a good crew to fuck with, better to love

[Interlude 2:]
I told y'all suckers, I told y'all suckers. I told y'all on RTJ1, then I told ya again on RTJ2, and you still ain't believe me. So here we go, RTJ3

[Outro:]
Talk to me
RTJ, Talk to me

// Legend Has It //

[Killer Mike:]
Hear what I say, we are the business today
Fuck shit is finished today (what)
RT & J, we the new PB & J
We dropped a classic today (what)
We did a tablet of acid today
Lit joints with the matches and ashes away
SKRRRT! We dash away
Donner and Dixon, the pistol is blasting away

[El-P:]
Doctors of death
Curing our patients of breath
We are the pain you can trust
Crooked at work
Cookin' up curses and slurs
Smokin' my brain into mush
I became famous for flamin' you fucks
Maimin' my way through the brush
There is no training or taming of me and my bruh
Look like a man, but I'm animal raw

[Killer Mike:]
We are the murderous pair
That went to jail and we murdered the murderers there
Then went to Hell and discovered the devil
Delivered some hurt and despair
Used to have powder to push
Now I smoke pounds of the kush
Holy, I'm burnin' a bush
Now I give a fuck about none of this shit
Jewel runner over and out of this bitch

Woo!
Woo!
Step into the spotlight, woo!
Woo!

[El-P:]
Copping of uppers and downers get done
I'm in a rush to be numb
Droppin' a thousand ain't much
Come from the clouds
On a missile to turn this whole town into dust
Don't make a sound, baby, hush
I am the living swipe right on the mic, I'm a slut
I don't know how to not spit like a lout
I'll spill a pound of my kids on your couch

[Killer Mike:]
Half of a mongrel and mythical team
Villainous treacherous things
Legend says El is a spawn out of Hell
The myth is my mama's a murderous queen
Your life can end like in Godfather 1
You get the gun as I christen my son
If I die today and it's Hell I should pay
Tell the Lord Mikey said, "Fuck, it was fun"

[El-P:]
Every new record's my dick in a box
We get a doozy, the mula's a lock
You're getting used to me doing no wrong
I don't play chicken, you prick, I'm a fox
You wanna kick it, I'll give you the rocks
You kiss the wood chipper blade if you balk
I'm fuckin' magic, in fact I'm a warlock of talk
I got a unicorn horn for a (stop)

Woo!
Woo!
Step into the spotlight, woo!
Woo!

And the crowd goes RTJ!
And the crowd goes RTJ!
And the crowd goes RTJ!
And the crowd goes RTJ!
RTJ!
RTJ!
RTJ!
RTJ!

[Killer Mike:]
Mike Pentangeli won't snitch
I'll rent a room at the Ritz
I'll sip a fifth of the whisk
I'll smoke a dub in the tub
Then I will split both my wrists

[El-P:]
I'll pull a sword on you simps
Just with a flick of the wrist
Get your neck giving up mist
Me and Mike skip away whistlin' and grin
Every day's golden when you only win

[Killer Mike (El-P):]
Bullyin' bastards and beatin' on beats
Sounds like a day at the beach (preach)
I keep it middle school, step on your feet
Before you can speak, blow to the teeth

[El-P:]
We move among the ones you think are meek
You think I'm lion, you right, see my teeth
Don't be a bore when I'm roaring vamoose
Hunting's no fun when your prey doesn't move
I'll put a gun to a bunny like choose
Say somethin' funny or bunny go boom
You got a bevy of shit you could groove
We'd like to thank you for choosing our crew

[Killer Mike:]
And that's from the crew you can trust
Warranty plus for fuckin' shit up
We are the no-gooders, do-gooders
Known to the dancers and dealers and doers of dust

// Call Ticketron //

[Ticketron:]
Live, Li-li-li-li-
Live from the Garden

[El-P:]
Run The Jewels live at the Garden
Lickin' off shots and we aim for the darkness
Make it get hot for a target
Kids cook s'mores off the crotch of our targets
Kumbaya bitch
Buckle up lil' trooper
You can't get past me, I'm stuck in the future
The shit ain't all it's cracked up to be
The hover craft's cool but the air's so putrid

[Killer Mike:]
You can tell by the stench in the air
Blood's on the ground, opportunity is here
I'm lookin' into space like, "Is anybody there?
And if aliens are here, please tell me how near
Do you come in peace or should everybody fear?
I'll wait your reply with a blunt and a beer."
I be the high guy with the belly and the beard
Smoke signal ET, ATLiens here

[El-P (Ticketron):]

[El-P:]
Beggin' your pardon, Run the Jewels live at the garden
Last two pirates alive are still yargin (yargin)
My girl got my heart, it's a bargain
Lick from her lips to the crease in her garter
Her ass my religion, her love's why I'm livin'
I smoke farm to face the field full, partner
Life's a shitnado, the smoke my umbrella
The boy's back turnin' his slacks to all yella (Prick)
It's a daily lick, I slit throats with a grin that reek of pure shit
Travel by backflip, eat from the river, the panther heart taught to talk by smart chicks
Sip pure venom and skipped away grinnin'
I put that on mom, she ain't raise a Vic
Lil' fucknuts, sit
I piss on your with, dismiss your whole shit

[Killer Mike:]
Live from the stage of the garden
We be the realest of the killers of the fuck shit squadron
Movin' through the streets and we lootin, ' robbin'
Mobbin, ' marchin', carrying our coffin
Hello everybody, this is now bank robbery
Jesse James gang, we'll walk you through the process
You don't wanna be a hero, do not let that thought process
We will put a bullet where your thoughts get processed
Get that fuck shit straight like a perm or a process
Cause for real the money money ain't the mother fuckin' object
We just like exitement, gun fights, indictments
High speed chase through Manhattan in the night winds
Ooh, its the thrill of the kill
Watching Kill Bill on a pill as I grip steerin' wheel
Cops coulda had the boy jammed I feel
But like Eddie Kane I made it I'm here

[El-P (Ticketron):]
Beggin' your pardon, Run the Jewels live at the garden

[Killer Mike:]
I'm the shamalama doomalama danger dick'll do your mama
Skeeter with the peter, never eat her, tell her see ya later
Holla 'bout tomorrow, baby, I ain't got to holler (Vroom, vroom)
My Impala pop a pussy, pop a collar
Pop a pill then chill, no pill, no Cosby
Not a raper or a taker, bonafide heartbreaker
Hit her once, hit her twice, then tell her see ya later
Got head, watch Vice at her home in Decatur

[El-P:]
Full clip, I'm a little bit sick, come equipped
Look at what I did for the grit, got it lit, what a cinch
Brought 'em just a little pinch of the truth, and they flip
Now they hanging from my shit, lil' bit
It's the Mensch, the myth
I do push-ups nude on the edge of cliffs
The jewels come quick, all gold and bricked
Click, click, boxer cutter spit
Brother, what a trip

// Hey Kids (Bumaye) //

Hey, hey k-
Hey kids!
(This is so crazy!)

[Killer Mike:]
Say hello to the masters, on behalf of the classless masses
We showed up, ski masks, picks, and axes to murder asses
Lift up our glasses and watch your palaces burn to ashes
Fucking fascists, who the fuck are you to give fifty lashes
All cause I'm motivated, stimulated, never smoking simulated happy and burning hashes
Killer, killer, dealing with him like he's a squealer
Get 'em, got 'em, shout 'em, and flipped the matress
Woo! I'm the man bitch, got big ideas, got plans to rob
Any Rothschild living, Bill Gates and the ghost of Jobs
Yeah I said it, I meant it, I ain't flinchin, Marshawn Lynchin' it
Run through a motherfucker's face like ig'nant, isn't it
Domain eminent, we the preeminant
Villainous willingness, spitting this ready raw rap shit rhyme ridiculous
Enemy grave he digging it, then we piss in it
Us go to hell, we been in it, gettin' it, yeah

Bumaye
Bumaye
Bumaye
Bumaye

[El-P:]
Aye, aye kids
I'm the fucking tits, I hold no regard for no fucking myth, hey
I lived half my life to give half my cash to these half man imps
They got half a heart, they give half a fuck, they got half the guns
I got half an hour, I'll burn half a pound and I have to run
Killers of the earth get scared
You do not get one word
You do not live for the heard
Even you living's absurd, better off kicked to the curb
That is my word
Back in the Berenstein timeline zip, no wins for the kid oh shit I got curved
In the Berenstain riff, I'm a Biff, so sick when the clock is lit, the whip swerve
It's like nothin' not broke, can't stand the scope in the booth
I disrobe like pederast pope on a play-date
Better call may day, baby I'll spray, I'm an AK
They flayed and plated, I'm serving dead meat fame to table
Cain to Abel, death's apprentice
Run the Jewels'll make last breaths Brexit

Bumaye
Bumaye
Bumaye
Bumaye

[Danny Brown:]
Word architect, when I arch the tech, I'll part ya' neck
Got bars on deck, that Xanax flow, make you nod your head
Like a gram of blow, you inject
My words infect like insects havin' incest, I'm in check, like pay day on a Thursday and it's Wednesday
I'm sensei, you bouquet, you menstruate
That's pussy all on your template, we skate, skate on 'em twenty-eight
Get pearl tongue like every day, so I Run them Jewels in every state
I kill a mic with Killer Mike, roll el's out a p with El-P
My self-esteem on king, got head so big no crown can't fit me
No bitch on my ding-a-ling when she ride on it she wet like a jet-ski
Please be alarmed, be warned
Please be alarmed, be warned
Give up that charm or get harmed
Watch, too or your time gone, and the rings or your life pawned and we gone

You made my eardrums bleed and I will pinch you

// Stay Gold //

[Killer Mike (Mike's son):]
Say, "Dad, uncle El, stay gold"
(Dad, uncle El, stay gold)

[El-P (Killer Mike) {both}:]
I got a bad girl
I got a brain-with-an-ass girl
She got a mean bop, I got a lean to the way I walk
And they get it like gold
G-O-L-D G-O-L-D, it's gold
G-O-L-D G-O-L-D, that's...
(I got a good thing with a bad bitch, that's rare bitch
She don't even like you hoes, she'll walk in the room take errr bitch
Gold)
{G-O-L-D G-O-L-D, it's gold
G-O-L-D G-O-L-D, that's gold}

[El-P:]
I got a bad girl
I got a brain-with-an-ass girl
She got a mean bop
I got a lean to the way I walk
And I get it like gold
All you fucking frauds can keep juggling lava rocks, I'm non-compliant
I'll define it, nothing servile, all defiance
You're gonna love how we ride to the gates on a lion, hi and smiling
Me and Mike, we just think alike and can't stop high-fiving
I'm not a running man, I'll do the wop on you hoes, then grab the dough
I hit a lick every time we park the bus, then it's time to go

[Killer Mike:]
I got a good thing with a bad bitch, that's rare bitch
She don't even like you hoes, she'll walk in the room take errr bitch
We fuss, we fight, we fuck like freaks what a fabulous marriage
You ain't lived you life 'til you've seen a bad bitch eat your wife like a savage
Not your average guys, we play cool but see through savage eyes
We're the crooks, we'll run the jux and kidnap mom from jazzercise
Get Stockholm syndrome when she get home, mom's like, "I like those fuckin' guys."
Thanks for the ransom handsome, let Mom know the guys loved her pumpkin pie

[El-P (Killer Mike) {both}:]
I got a bad girl

{G-O-L-D G-O-L-D, it's gold
G-O-L-D G-O-L-D, that's gold}

[El-P:]
Check it out
Gold is shiny, gold is fun
Some like taking gold with guns
A heart ain't gold if it don't like us
But go for the gold dumb fuck, good luck
A golden boy man good as gold
Golden rule is, "Don't lose your soul."
Piss on power
Golden shower
Golden rays of sun grow my dope

[Killer Mike:]
Look at my gold
Going for the gold 'fore a G get old
And his heart grow cold
I go-go-go for every year my career was slow
And seemed that it wouldn't go
And you should know we pitch these rhymes
Like Smoltz, like Glavine, like Maddox in ninety-five
And now we shine just like Eddie
Golden teeth from Greenbriar in ninety-nine

[El-P:]
Can't be broke when you own gold rope
Pawn shops offering cash for those
Cash is fake though, gold accrues
I make my own gold, golden goose
Run down yellow brick roads toward riches
Just be sure to not trust no wizards
The golden age is now gone, admit it
All that's gold is not gold that glitters

[Killer Mike:]
Thirty-six inch Cuban as I'm movin' through Cuba
With a half a ki of gold on my neck (Shiiiit)
Call me Gaddafi and pay me in gold
'Cause your money ain't really worth shit
Just a piece of paper to promote propaganda
To keep you in debt and know your dick
I see these dope boys had shit right all along
Puttin' gold all in them they bitch

[El-P (Killer Mike) {both}:]
I got a bad girl
I got a brain-with-an-ass girl

// Don't Get Captured //

[Killer Mike:]
Hello from a Little Shop of Horrors
Ski mask like a Phantom of the Opera
Go cold like the land of Chicago
Child soldiers sprayin' the chopper
But you don't give a fuck, that's them though
'Til a peasant put a pistol in your window
You ain't really need that chain
You ain't really need that ring
You ain't really need them thangs
Snow on The Bluff showed up
With the slums in the city blown up
Now the white folks showed up
Everything bought sold up
Niggas assed out, niggas po'd up
Politicians so corrupt, sold our black ass out
Really ain't color, my brother
Here in cabbage town they put they white-ass out
Truth been told, I'm out

[Killer Mike (El-P):]
He in here, me in here, we in here
(Don't get captured)
No cryin' here, just do your dirt and disappear
(Don't get captured)
Then lay it low, take it slow and reappear
(Don't get captured)
Return to us victorious, smoke pounds of kush
(Don't get captured)

[El-P:]
Good day from the house of the haunted
Get a job, get a house, get a coffin
Don't stray from the path, remain where you at
That maximizes our profit
Is that blunt? Oh well, hell, so's this boot
We live to hear you say "please don't shoot"
A pure delight, c'mon, make my night
When I file reports what's right's what I write
Snuff films air all night 'till your last sane thought take flight
What a great sight, what a job, what a good life
The more we act wrong the more we are right
And who exactly gon' stop what we got?
We don't argue, we are not calm and impartial
Some call it work, but it's more like an art
We just paint the walls with your heart
And we better not catch you

[Killer Mike (El-P):]
He in here, me in here, we in here
(Don't get captured)
No cryin' here, just do your dirt and disappear
(Don't get captured)
Then lay it low, take it slow and reappear
(Don't get captured)
Return to us victorious, smoke pounds of kush
(Don't get captured)

[Killer Mike (El-P):]
Don't get captured
(Don't get captured)
Don't get captured
(Don't get captured)
Don't get captured

// Thieves! (Screamed The Ghost) //

[Sample - Twilight Zone "The Obsolete Man":]
You walk into this room at your own risk, because it leads to the future, not a future that will be but one that might be. This is not a new world, it is simply an extension of what began in the old one

[Killer Mike:]
(Conversing with a ghost, conversing with a ghost)
He just leaving and he screamin' Jesus
(He had the highest hopes, he had the highest hopes)
People yelling, screamin' at polices
(Riots tonight, riots tonight)
Burnin', lootin', shootin', takin', thievin'
(Fire and light, fire and light)
Fill the air and most don't know the reason
(Never knew his name, never knew his name)
But they know his problems and feel his pain
(Shit's still the same, shit's still the same)
We just prey off in they deadly game
(It'll never change, it'll never change)
Too much profit in it and it stay the same
(The facts still remain, the facts still remain)
You can burn the system and start again

[El-P:]
(Spoke with a ghost)
Late night, same night, "God, let me sleep, please, I'm begging you"
(Said don't be afraid)
Daylight might never break right again once they get at you
(Said you'll never be alone again)
This house is haunted by pain transposed into revenue
(The murdered all stay)
That thing when your mind says "Run!" but your heart isn't letting you
(Said we got an army now)
You strike 'em down, still they live inside hearts, hearts carry them
(The weapon is our memory)
Some get to count sheep, some gotta count kids that they burying
(I don't wanna scare nobody)
Fears been law for so long that rage feels like therapy
(But I'm gonna make 'em remember me)
Nobody gets no more sleep till we teach them remembering

Thieves!
Thieves!

[El-P:]
Coming live at five, we got new news breaking
You heard here first if you don't die waiting
Hard to review the scene I just seen
I'm a try to convey, but it defies explaining
Started with folks just crying
Nothing but broken heart sobs and the shriek of the sirens
Right at the spot where the blood's still drying
Then (My God) I saw it, the dead began rising
I don't know much about science
But I seen an army of armed men stop and get quiet
Mist hung low like a prayer from a tyrant
Sky became black like the stars aren't aligning
So many years of this violence
Now we're surrounded by the souls of the dead and defiant
Saying "Look what you've done, you designed it"
When the bough breaks, hear the wraith scream, "Riot!"

[Killer Mike:]
No more moms and dads crying
No more arms in the air
We put firearms in the air
Molotov cocktails thrown in the air
CNN got dummy Don on the air
Talking 'bout he smell that ganj in the air
Dummy don't know and dummy don't care
Get that punk motherfucker outta here
Aye, ghosts are walking
Ghosts are talking
Everything gon' be different, mane
Shh, karma's coming
Ain't no runnin'
Death gon' deal with the guilty, mane
The universe curses the killers, mane
Can't keep killin' God's children, mane
A pound of flesh is what you owe
Your debt is due, give up your ghost

Thieves!
Thieves!
Thieves!

[Tunde Adebimpe:]
What have you done?
What have you done?
What have you done?
What are you making us do?
Thieves!
It's on you
It's on you
Thieves!
It's on you
It's on you
It's on you
Thieves!

[Sample - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.:]
I think America must see that riots do not develop out of thin air. Certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots. But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard

Thieves!

// 2100 //

[Killer Mike:]
How long before the hate that we hold
Lead us to another Holocaust?
Are we so deep in it that we can't end it?
Stop, hold, ever call it off
It's too clear, nuclear's too near
And the holders of the molotov
Say that "revolution's right here, right now"
And they ain't callin' off

[El-P:]
Wake up, roll an eighth up
Throw a double finger with a fist
Here at the abyss
I will be your tour guide
It is war time, check your wrists (Ready, kids?)
Over to your right, shine a light
Got a bevy ready for the fight
I just wanna live, I don't wanna ever have to load a clip
Only hunt bliss
I am still a kid in my heart
But these motherfuckers sick
They don't give a shit, not at all
They don't even want to let you take a little piss in a pot
Listen along
They don't want your love, shit is bugged
Motherfuckers steady getting rich from the blood
Love when you beg
Trust, I would sooner put a puckered pair of lips to the sun
Love will survive
Run out under iridescent lights for our lives
I will be surprised if we ever got the feeling so alive as tonight
Wild for the night
Look into my eyes
I am standing at your side for the fight
Minds over might
Swear to God
They could barely even see the dog
They don't see the size of the fight

[Killer Mike:]
Wake up
Drink water
Smoke blunt
Clean off my Kalashnikov
Stop, pow
Ten for a min
Free this case shit, get the poppin' off
The evening news givin' yous views
Telling you to pick your master for president
Then behind the curtain, seen the devil workin'
Came back with some evidence
I'm here to tell you don't let em tell you what's right wrong
Make love, smoke kush, fight, or laugh hard, and live long
That's the anecdote
You defeat the devil when you hold onto hope
'Cause kinfolk life is beautiful
And we ain't gotta die for them other men
And I refuse to kill another human being
In the name of a government
'Cause I don't study war no more
I don't hate the poor no more
Gettin' more ain't what's more
Only thing more is the love
So when you see me
Please greet me with a heart full
And a pound and a hug

[BOOTS:]
Save my swollen heart
Bring me home from the dark
Take me home, take me home, take me home
Take me home, take me home, take me home

Up, up, up
Up, up
Up, up, up, up, up, up

[Killer Mike:]
Seen the devil give a sermon in the church
Seen an angel dancing in the club
Tryin' to feed a baby so I threw a thousand in the air
And blessed her with a hug
I done been down so many times
Walked on like a dirty rug
And now that I made it, can't fake it
Gotta give me what I'm truly worthy of
(Worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy)

[EL-P:]
And I don't how much it really means to be right
(Means to be right, means to be right)
And what a joy it'd be to see some peace in this life
(Peace in this life, peace in this life)
And it occurs to me that maybe we ain't ever really seen any right
Here in the dark
Hoping just to see a beam of the light
(Beam of the light, beam of the light)

[BOOTS:]
Save my swollen heart
Bring me home from the dark
Take me home, take me home, take me home
Take me home, take me home, take me home

// Panther Like A Panther (Miracle Mix) //

[El-P:]
I'll flood the speakers with heat seakers
And keep sneakers cleaner than nunnery pussy evening of Easter
I'll leave my prints on her keester, I suck the clit and release it if it will please her
I'll kneel to her, best believe make a meal of her...
Thank you

[Snapping]

(Yes, yes, brilliant)

Told the preacher I love her, he said that God was a lover
I said if he really loves her then he would love that we're lovers
I walk around in a bubble, a fucking scoundrel in trouble
In every town, make a rumble, the venue ground into rubble
Give me a ten, and I'll double, I'll split your face like some aces
I got a fragrance I'm wearing called, "I will shit on you basics."
The money wants me to have it, I have a hunger for data
I'm crunching numbers and crack unbreakable safes while I'm at it
I'm doing more than just rapping you have to grant me that dap
When you around where I'm at just know that it is not where you at
I'm not on your map, I'm a mystery to you captains of industry
If the 'matic is missing me automatic, it's victory
Hey!

[Trina (El-P & Killer Mike):]
I'm the shit
Looking at the money like it's mine to get
(I'm the shit bitch)
Everybody down, throw the pistol and fist
I'm the shit
(We looking at the money like it's ours to get
I'm the shit bitch
Everybody live throw the pistol and fist)

[Killer Mike:]
We the grimy and gritty, made it the Grammy committees
Got told that we spit it too vicious and would never see victory
And I refuse to play humble as though my dick itty bitty
I got banana dick, your bitch go apeshit if she hit it
Meanwhile, you're too nervous, pervis, that's why you never get service
And me, I caught the preacher's wife workin' 'fore Sunday service
I put my hand up her skirt and then we prayed for purpose
I baptized her in Jesus name, left her shakin' and squirtin'
Ooh, I shocked the Sunday school and did that shit there on purpose
See, I'm a pervert with purpose that make you question your purpose
Run the Jewels'll arrive at arenas, bunch of blood thirsty hyenas
To get revenge on the kingdoms that killed the dreams of the dreamers
Drank alcohol for the demons, sip lean with all of the schemers
You see he groove with the people, move with the mind of a genius
You see, he workin' the angles so he ain't never an angel
They wanna get you to hang him, well give them fuckers a finger

[Trina (El-P & Killer Mike):]
I'm the shit
Looking at the money like it's mine to get
(I'm the shit bitch)
Everybody down, throw the pistol and fist
I'm the shit
(We looking at the money like it's ours to get
I'm the shit bitch
Everybody live throw the pistol and fist)

[El-P:]
Welcome to fuckyoupalooze, we bruisin' any who movin'
Who wanna stan' for these douches, you raise a hand and you lose it
I hold the door for old ladies, run into fires and save babies
I went to school in the eighties, taking the train with the crazies
New York, New York is the mothership where I used to smoke dust and shit
Now, I'm crop dustin' fuckers, suck it up and you'll love the shit
No more games, I'm above the shit, butter me up for nothing
I'm taking all of your ducats 'cause I can call when you're bluffing

[Killer Mike:]
Who thought the son of Denise would be the leader of people?
When he was your house at Morehouse, slangin' pounds of the reefer
Sat with potential presidents and said the p should be legal as reparations
For what this nation has done to my people
I'm a pervert, a poet, I ain't a saint, and I know it
Been a crook and cooked the books but never shorted no whores
Promoters comp me the Moet, I'm the man and I know it
I'm the shit, Bitch, tell me, how could I not show it?

[Trina (El-P & Killer Mike):]
I'm the shit
Looking at the money like it's mine to get
(I'm the shit bitch)
Everybody down, throw the pistol and fist
I'm the shit
(We looking at the money like it's ours to get
I'm the shit bitch
Everybody live throw the pistol and fist)
I'm the shit

// Everybody Stay Calm //

Take it easy

[El-P:]
Excusez-moi bitches
I'm lit from the last of the gas, Mike twisted
No sleep for the vicious, key up a cop car just to see mischief
I'm a nut punch wizard
Speed bag ya' ball bag leave none in it
We, we got one ambition
Re-up and puff til the month go missing

[Killer Mike:]
Big, big, big black fellow with a four-fifth in the back, backpack fella
I, I rumble don't stumble young fellow
Got a stinger in the '69 bumblebee yellow
I mean, I mean stunner, big titty bank teller had my wife here with her so a hater can't tell her
Presidential suite, got a fuck boy jealous
I'm the Nelson Mandela of Atlanta dope sellers

[El-P (Killer Mike):]
I, I'm a goddamn savage
Eat with no hands I don't even use napkins
Mark says number one bastard, show up in jorts with a hatchet laughing
(Hey El, the AR's an option for any asshole wanna talk and pop shit
Quit playing pussy or the pistol will pop off
And get your whole face pushed back or knocked off)

Take it easy partner
Ain't no chilling in the land of the villains
Ain't no chilling, ain't no chilling

[El-P:]
They fucked up and paid us, made us dangerous
Too old to change, I'm a stay with paper
Poor folk love us the rich hate our faces
We talk too loud, won't remain in our places
Smoke by the acre, a brain escapist
Smoke anymore and my brain is vapor
I don't do meek anymore, guy, save it
The laughing is done now, time to cry later

[Killer Mike:]
Tell them haters and bitches we bang big shit, but yeah you should mind your business
You can't pause or shun this, physical fitness, bitch we run this
Paraplegics, you don't run shit, fuck you even, get the gumption
Think you stylin', think you stuntin'
I'll smack the fuck out ya' ass for frontin'
That seems a little aggressive

[El-P:]
Oompa-loompas, I'll shoot a tune atcha medullas
I'm cool as a rule but I'll scalp a ruler
I'm new to this town, I'm a stranger passing
I see your bum crews, I don't get the hoopla
(The world got rules they say) That's a rumour
Benign, nah I'm lying it's a tumour
They ain't even tryna' buy that we cryin' goobye
We got dying to do, dude, the design's ruthless

[Killer Mike:]
One-two, one-two
I done read books by Sun-Tzu
Learned from beautiful women who rolled my joints too
The opposite of humble and my swag on kung-fu
No admission for the cool, I just kick it and come through
Hurry up we got liquor to run through
Bales to inhale, lies to not tell
She told me let her go and then I can exhale
I left her with a pound of dro and a Nextel

Take it easy, partner
Ain't no chilling in the land of the villains
Ain't no chilling, ain't no chilling

// Oh Mama //

[Killer Mike (El-P):]
Gun in the holster be
Right in the upholstery
Somewhere right close to me
Just in case the rollers be
Rolling on the G
My woman keep it in the hosiery
I'm known in my town
In those strips where high-rollers be
I'm up early, where the money folders sippin' Folgers be
A country boy chilling in Brooklyn like Lefty spoke for me
(Fuck with us
You fuck with the truth, we speak openly)
Never a rat, like Donnie Brasco, though
Cause there ain't no hoe in me

[El-P (Killer Mike):]
"Notice me, senpai!" they cry when I choke their speak
I'll set this crooked city on fire to light the smokery
Old timers speak of us hushed and clutch their rosaries
I lust after greatness, I'm aiming right at its ovaries
Better run from the future palooka (haul off)
You acting like it's safe when the revolution's been (called off)
There's liars on the loose, if we listen to you we're (all lost)
The takers of the jewels never singing a tune at (all soft)

[El-P:]
My mama said that I'm not living right
She said, "I'm crying on you"
She said, "I waited up for you all night"
I said, "I'm trying mama"
My mama said that I'm not living right
She said, "I'm crying on you"
She said, "I waited up for you all night"
I said, "I'm trying mama"

[Killer Mike:]
I smoke the holy herb, get high as hell and meditate
Swear to God, shit's so good, fat boy'll levitate
God gift to man, how the fuck they try to legislate
Mom's, she recovering, tell me I over-medicate
I tell her, "Holy fuck, Jesus Christ, give me a fucking break"
She said, "Don't curse your mama, goddammit," and threw a dinner plate (damn)

[El-P:]
I heard it in Brooklyn where all the sinners stay
You running out of ways to go fuck yourself, I will innovate
The skin of your shitty grin will disintegrate
Every sickening sentence'll cheapen the tricks you venerate
Set the phaser to face-plate-incinerate
Run the Jewels, run with the Borg, baby, assimilate

[El-P (Killer Mike):]
My mama said that I'm not living right
She said, "I'm crying on you"
She said, "I waited up for you all night"
I said, "I'm trying mama"
My mama said that I'm not living right
She said, "I'm crying on you"
She said, "I waited up for you all night"
I said, "I'm trying mama"

My mama said that I'm not living right
(They want us dying, mama)
My mama said that I'm not living right
(But I ain't crying, mama)
My mama said that I'm not living right
(You raised a lion mama
Now you lying, mama)
My mama said that I'm not living right
I said, "I'm trying mama"
(I'm crying on you, crying on you)
I said, "I'm trying mama"

// Thursday In The Danger Room //

[El-P:]
Right for a right, wrong for a wrong
This is clearly not life's design
Figure out quickly that nothing gets answered
When you ask the universe why
Life is a journey, to live is to worry
To love is to lose your damn mind
But living's a blessing so I am not stressing
'Cause some of my friends ain't survived
That's the release, but in much bigger pieces, I'm living on limited time
Like how do you look in the eyes of a friend and not cry when you know that they're dying?
How do you feel 'bout yourself when you know that sometimes you had wished they were gone?
Not because you didn't love 'em but just because you felt too weak to be strong
You couldn't bear to see someone who prided themselves on the strength to feel weak
You prove to your randomness, hold it for ransom, that life will not fade in your dreams
You see that they're fighting and know that they're losing but still you make jokes and you laugh
'Cause you know despite all the sadness that you better get the good times while they last
Now every new word that they speak you are already feeling like it's in the past
And when they all gone you just try to move on 'cause the memory's hurting too bad
Grown up so much and I wonder who you'd've become if you stuck for a while
Just know that I love you, good friend, ain't forget you, and when I remember I smile

[Killer Mike & El-P:]
And I guess I'd say I'll see you soon
But the truth is that I see you now
Still talk to you like you're around
And I guess I say you left too soon
But the truth is that you never left
'Cause I never let myself forget

[Killer Mike:]
An eye for an eye, and a tooth for the tooth
Will leave us all mumbling and blind
So we stumble blind through depths of the dark
Looking for something divine
Life is a journey, to live is to suffer
And I have been suffering through mine
But living's a blessing so I ain't no stressing
'Cause some of my niggas ain't 'round
He got no drama but his baby mama is still on my line and she cryin'
I searched for the words to give her some comfort for her soul and spirit and mind
I tell her that it'll be fine
But deep down I know that I'm lying
The family came took rings and his chains
The bank took the house and the rights
The only thing left was his child, and she had a smile in his eyes
So much to the soul, when the grandmama kept her, she'd look at her sometime and cry
The very next day she cried
And day after day she cried
Then called baby mama and told her "I'm sorry, can't keep her no more, I have tried"
No killer was captured, but I know he listening
So I'd like to tell you in song
The streets was a jungle, I pray that you made it, I hope that you righted your wrongs
I hope that you learn, I hope that you changed so your mama won't know this pain
So my homie's name will mean something more than a nigga got killed for a chain

[Killer Mike & El-P:]
And I guess I'd say I'll see you soon
But the truth is that I see you now
Still talk to you like you're around
And I guess I say you left too soon
But the truth is that you never left
'Cause I never let myself forget

// A Report To The Shareholders / Kill Your Masters //

[A Report to the Shareholders]

[El-P:]
Beware of horses
I mean a horse is a horse of course, but who rides is important
Sitting high with a uniform, barking orders, demanding order
And I'm scared that I talk too much about what I think's going on
I got a way with this, they might drag me away for this
Put me in a cage for this, I might pay for this
I just say what I want like I'm made for this
But I'm just afraid some days I might be wrong
Maybe that's why me and Mike get along
Hey, not from the same part of town, but we both hear the same sound coming
(Woo!)
And it sounds like war
(Woo!)
And it breaks our hearts
When I started this band, didn't have no plans, didn't see no arc
Just run with the craft, have a couple laughs
Make a buck and dash, yeah
Get a little dap like "Yeah I'm the fucking man! ", yeah
Maybe give a little back like, "Here, I do what I can"
It's all jokes and smoke 'till the truth start schemin'
Can't contain the disdain for y'all demons
You talk clean and bomb hospitals
So I speak with the foulest mouth possible
And I drink like a Vulcan losing all faith in the logical
I will not be confused for docile
I'm free, motherfuckers, I'm hostile

[Killer Mike:]
Choose the lesser of the evil people, and the devil still gon' win
It could all be over tomorrow, kill our masters and start again
But we know we all afraid, so we just simply cry and march again
At the Dem Conven my heart broke apart when I seen them march mommas in
As I rap this verse right now, got tears flowing down my chocolate skin
Told the truth and I've been punished for it, must be a masochist 'cause I done it again
Ooh, Mike said "uterus", they acting like Mike said "You a bitch"
To every writer who wrote it, misquoted it
Mike says, "You a bitch, you a bitch, you a bitch!"
Add a "nigga" for that black writer that started that sewer shit
I maneuver through manure like a slumdog millionaire
El-P told me, "Fuck them devils, Mike, we gon' be millionaires"
I respond with a heavy "Yeah"
Big bro says "Fuck that, toughen up
Stay ready, write raw raps, shit rugged rough"
The devil don't sleep, us either
El spits fire, I spit ether
We the gladiators that oppose all Caesars
Coming soon on a new world tour
Probably play the score for the World War
At the apocalypse, play the encore
Turn around, see El, and I smile
Hell coming and we got about a mile
Until it's over I remain hostile...


[Kill Your Masters]

[Killer Mike:]
Mere mortals, the Gods coming so miss me with the whoopty-whoop
You take the devil for God, look how he doin' you
I'm Jack Johnson, I beat a slave catcher snaggletooth
I'm Tiger Flowers with a higher power, hallelu'
Life'll get so bad it feel like God mad at you
But that's a feeling, baby, ever lose, I refuse
I disabuse these foolish fools of they foolish views
I heard the revolution coming, you should spread the news
Garvey-mind, Tyson-punch, this is bad news
So feel me, follow me
Devil done got on top of me
Bad times got a monopoly
Give up, I did the opposite
Pitch perfect, did it properly
Owner killed by his property

[El-P:]
This life'll stress you like Orson Welles on the radio
War after war of the world'll make all your saneness go
And these invaders from Earth're twerkin' on graves you know
Can't wait to load up the silos and make your babies glow
It's so abusive you'll beg somebody to roofie you
They'll snatch your hope up and use it like it's a hula-hoop
And it's a loop, they talk to you just like their rulers do
These fucking fools have forgotten just who been fooling who

[Killer Mike:]
Kill your, kill- kill your kill your, kill-
Kill your, kill- kill- kill your, kill-
Kill your masters
Kill your, kill- kill your kill your, kill-
Kill your, kill- kill- kill your, kill-
Kill your masters
Kill your, kill- kill your kill your, kill-
Kill your, kill- kill- kill your, kill-
Kill your masters
Kill your, kill- kill your kill your, kill-
Kill your, kill- kill- kill your, kill-
Kill your masters

[Zack de la Rocha:]
Killer children of men on the throne roving with no atonement
Got me feeling like I'm Clive Owen rowing through a future frozen
But the flow is a burning wind, blowing to your coast and
Now in cages 'cause we rode the waves of your explosions
Done appealing to our killers, man, to stop the bleeding
This song's a dirty bomb for they dirty dealings
Boots on the roof, I'm Charley Mingus dumping through the ceiling
Master P-ing on these lost Europeans thievin'
Shit be grim, and De La born a reaper
Born in the beast and fixin' feast tearin' its features
The world surges, the nation's nervous
The crowds awaken, they can't disperse us
We ain't at your service, won't stay sedated
Won't state our numbers for names and remain faceless
We dignified, they can't erase us
We ain't asleep, we rope a dope through the flames
Man, the world gonna ride on what's implied in the name
Run 'em

[Killer Mike:]
Kill your, kill- kill your kill your, kill-
Kill your, kill- kill- kill your, kill-
Kill your masters
Kill your, kill- kill your kill your, kill-
Kill your, kill- kill- kill your, kill-
Kill your masters
Kill your, kill- kill your kill your, kill-
Kill your, kill- kill- kill your, kill-
Kill your masters
Kill your, kill- kill your kill your, kill-
Kill your, kill- kill- kill your, kill-
Kill your masters
