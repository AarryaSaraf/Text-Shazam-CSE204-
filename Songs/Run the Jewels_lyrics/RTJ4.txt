// yankee and the brave //

This week on Yankee and the brave

Back at it like a crack addict, Mr. Black Magic, crack a bitch back
Chiropractic, Craftmatic big daddy smokin' big Cali
In the black alley, in a black Grand Natty
Rollin' down, ole natty hair
Nappy, matty as a black, grandaddy, all fact
No cappin', fat, black, bold cappin', stay floatin'
No flappin', where he runnin'? I'm a gunner
I'ma have your block hot as a sauna all summer
And I put that on Osama and my motherfuckin' momma
I'ma terrorize the actors playing like they want some drama
I'ma chop 'em with a chopper 'till I motherfuckin' drop 'em (Drop 'em, drop 'em, drop 'em, drop 'em)

Stack addict, I mack with the blackest fabric, I'm back
I'm magically rackin' it, that's what I'm thunkin', rat-a-tat-tats
I'm runnin' the trunk up for sucker shit
Matter of fact, kiss the ass and even the cra-a-ack
Automatic facts, it's like tha-a-at
Scandal bliss when you puttin' feelings in charge of shit
All of us targeted, all we doin' is arguin'
Part of them isn't workin' 'till every pockets been picked and sold and harvested
I'm ready to mob all these fuckin' Charlatans

Go-go-go-, go-go-go-go-
Go-go-go-go-, Go-go-go-go-
Go-go-go-go-, go-go-go-, go-go-
We up, now loot

Two time Don, I'm galactic and fly
The moon is movin', the maniac's in a shitty decline
Hearts fried, all this neon is grippin' in something's side
Immortality's out of bounds, this a one-round ride

I got one round left, a hunnid cops outside
I could shoot at them or put one between my eyes
Chose the latter, it don't matter, it ain't suicide
And if the news say it was that's a goddamn lie
I can't let the pigs kill me, I got too much pride
And I meant it when I said it, never take me alive

I got the Grand Nat runnin' in the alley outside
Yo Mike run like you hungry and get your ass in the ride
I'd rather have and not need you than watch your rotten demise
And you still owe for them Nikes, you do not get to just die
You try to fuck with my brother, you get the bastard surprise
And that's more honest than your whole life in a fraction of time
I didn't get my degree in how to smoke weed 'till I'm fly
So you could ruin my high, Jewel Runner, do and you're bye

My brother made a point so out the back door I'ma slide
I'm chubby, husky, die scrubbin', fuckin' up my Levi's
The crooked copper got the proper, I put lead in his eye
Plus we heard he murdered a black child so none of us cry

Yankee and the brave are here
Everybody hit the deck
We don't mean no harm
But we truly mean all the disrespect (Four)

// ooh la la //

[El-P:]
Uh, hey (Oh, shit)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Hey)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Hey)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Let's go)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Go, go, go, go)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Go, go, go)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la

Lookin' for Ms like I lost a friend
Jump out of my bed like, "Where the bread"
You gon' hold a egg, waiter bring the check
When we talk, we Kalashnikov, keep us in your thoughts
Fully dressed at the crack of dawn, weapons letting off
I can hear them from the block, see them creeping through the fog
Season's greetings, now feeding season can start, oh my God
Look alive, lookin' like I live life on the crooked line
Doin' fine, you want maximum stupid, I am the guy

[Killer Mike:]
First of all, fuck the fuckin' law, we is fuckin' raw
Steak tartare, oysters on the half-shell, sushi bar
Life a bitch, and the pussy fish, still fucked her raw
I'm a dog, I'm a dirty dog, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ol' Dirty Bastard, go in your jaw, shimmy, shimmy, ya
Got the semi in the hemi, go and gimme, gimme, ya
Pugilistic, my linguistics are Jeru the Damaja
And I rap it pornographic, bitch, set up the camera

[El-P:]
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Hey)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ah, oui oui)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Got some weed, got some weed)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Got some weed, got some, ayy)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (I need a bottle of MoÃ«t, ho, come on)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Wassup)

You covet disruption, I got you covered, I'm bustin'
My brother's a runner, he's crushin', it's no discussion
I used to be munchkin, I wasn't 'posed to be nothin'
Y'all fuckers corrupted, or up to somethin disgustin'
My pockets are plump for the season, I love to cuff 'em
I'ma afraid of nothin' but nothin', the same as somethin'
Warmongers are dumpin' a pointed click at your pumpkin (Look out)
You're somethin' scrumptious, so put your kids in the oven

[Killer Mike:]
Fuck a king or queen and all of their loyal subjects
I'll pull my penis out and I piss on their shoes in public
People, we the pirates, the pride of this great republic
No matter what you order, muhfucka, we're what you're stuck wit
I used to love Bruce, but livin' my vida loca
Help me understand, I'm probably more of a Joker
When we usher in chaos, just know that we did it smilin'
Hannibal's on this island, inmates run the asylum

[El-P:]
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Hey)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Hey)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Hey)
Ooh, la la

DJ, DJ
Ooh, la la
Ooh, la, la, la, la
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
La, la, la, la, la

// out of sight //

Ayy, ayy

Ru-ru-run-run, here come the menace, it's a sobriety, like what?
Super thuggers thumpin' on the cut
What-what, what-what? My motherfuckin' Uzi weighs a ton
Hit the drum, do you hear it go, "Brrup-pum-pum-pum"
Run-run, piety just really isn't us
What a rush, see you cuttin' up a bod', that's my lunch
Ru-ru-run your motherfuckin' pockets when I come
It's an honor to be robbed by Denise's only son
Yeah, give a really baby boy, beta movin' extra heavy
Whippin' Chevy (Uh), gotta get it, eat spaghetti with the maf'
So vegan, bitch, if he don't get 'cause they don't eat no steak and lobster
Sosa was my hero, only Tony since a fuckin' Hawk
(Out of sight) Out of mind, out of touch, out of time
Man, I'll smoke a bogie backwards with thumb up like, "It's fine"
(Run) See yourself, I say, selflessly divine
Leave me here to drown in glory, you're too good to cross that line
(Run-run) Tragically struck down in my prime
By the speed at which the bags are dropping
Shoulda watched the sky
You don't wanna live this life, it's really not sublime
I'm only doing what I want while hockin' loogies at the swine

Out of sight (Ayy)
R-T-J, what you say? (Ayy)
I don't give a fuck, out-out-out-out of sight (ayy)
R-T-J, what you say? What you say? (Ayy)
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?

We the motivating, devastating, captivating, Ghost and Rae relating
Product of the fuckin '80s, coke dealing babies
Never regulating, bag accumulating, it would not be overstating to say they are underrating
The pride of Brooklyn and the Grady baby
We don't need no compliments or confidence
Our attitude and latitude is, "Fuck you pay me"
Next summer leather bombers, dookie ropes and smokin' indica
Ain't a team as mean and clean as J Meline and Michael Render, bruh
TV got no temperature, even if it did
Bitch, we cool as penguin pussy on the polar cap peninsula
Colder than your baby mama heart (Uh)
When she find out you been fuckin' with that other broad
And you ain't got that rent for her

I know you just about mcfuckin had it our shit is just magic
Go figure the runts of the litter did it without scammin'
Was fryin' in the fat of the land, now your man is mashin'
We back of the class and laughin', you raisin a hand and tattlin'
Mike shitted in your locker then left a note with a winky face
Meet us at three o'clock if you wanna do something tragic
We'll shrinky dinky all of that yappin', it's automated
The gears of the rapper shredder want action and it'll have it

You know I'm poppin', the product of fuckin poverty
I'm cool as AC and you niggas you just wannabes
I slide on tracks like home plate, ride beats like road rage
Got a crib in like four states, uh
I get a text like, "Stay safe"
Text back, "I miss that pussy, be home soon and I can't wait"
I came from a dream, triple beam, and some grey tape (Yeah)
A sister went shoppin' and put my bags in the A8
"Hello Mr. Big Face," the bank teller tryna get rank
I buy a hot dog stand if I'm tryna be frank
Just left the hospital, makin' sure my nigga was straight
And sent bail, couple dollars 'til they give him a date
Tony

Out-out-out of sight (Ayy)
R-T-J, what you say? (Ayy)
I don't give a fuck, out-out-out-out of sight (ayy)
R-T-J, what you say? What you say? (Ayy)
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?

// holy calamafuck //

The law defier, the non-complier
The death defier, the Mike Myers
Murder rapper for hire
Do-er of drive byers, the back back clack clack
Let it loose murder, all witnesses and survivors
That's a job completer, dependable contractor
The back hand wack rap slapper
Mr. leather bomber attacker
Catch ya getting off the escalator
Run the Jewels smooth and don't trigger the undertaker
As a teen lacking, I woulda ran me a supreme racket
I woulda took these lames' Supreme jackets
Until you rob a hype beast, you ain't seen sadness
"Clockwork Orange" madness, left the scene laughinâ

Ayy, we forever-ever,
Jaimito y Michael the Render
The pyrotechnicrats the' ol razzle dazzlers
The magic bean imbibers (Yes)
The green giant of the rhyme contrivers (Yes)
Supreme violence of the time describers (Yes)
I'm the decider, you evil eyers
A pile driver provider for liars, the sleep depriver
The nick of time mercy kill denier in prime
I'll kill the mood of a Buddhist MacGyver
I'll slap a yapper from the acne to the tooth bone fiber, I'm liver
Thought crime designer criminal minder
And I'm a born and bred in USA who chop and screw truth up
Think I got a case of the Mondays, on fire

Ayo, one for mayhem, two for mischief
Now aim for the drones in your zoning district
Hindenburg 'em, get 'em, burn 'em
Can't give the ghost up, no resistance
Pass that shit, Mike, I have to insist it
Reality sucks dick, how's that for wisdom?
I'll lick a toad's back like, "Mmm, delicious"
Time elves wave to me off in the distance
Hey lil' guy I'm just walkin' through
From another timeline where monsters eat truth
Physicists say the dough I get's proof
The multiverse lives, I'm supposed to just lose
The glass bottom tank I drive is all fueled
Better try to stay cool honey bunny don't move
Fuck shit glows in the hearts of the brutes
You hate Run The Jewels, you don't love the troops
You miss the point tryna act like shit's cool
Don't fuckin' tell doom your number's not due
Every other goddamned year I'm brand new
It's been 20 plus years you think that's a clue?
Maybe this guy kinda kills what he do
He's prolly that dude he left enough proof
Plenty of these goofs just disappeared, poof
I'm still the next big thing, gotta hurt, oof, I got

Fire, fire, fire, hot fuego

This the pay back, allow me to state that
All that forth back, we don't play that
You want beef, bruh, you just state that
And we steak that, fry and bake that
One time in the big old south
Lived a lil chubby kid with a big ol' mouth
Lame writers gave him big ol' doubts
Now the same lil boy in a big ol' house
Look at him now in the big ol' cars
And the same folk hated pay big homage
One minute let me be candid
Used to stand by the garbage can hand to handin'
That dumb trap shit, no proper planning
Seen ignorant shit like geekers dancing
And rappers rap about it like it's so romantic
But I still can't seem to escape the panic
PTSD streets did the damage
Kept me in hammock, laid back with cannons
Get me fucked up, it be's calamity
I'ma come through and leave some damages
Goddamn somebody call 'ambulams', or ambulances out of chances
Fuck that weak shit, you be bantering
You're a common cold and my flows are cancerous

Fire, fire, fire, hot fuego

Take that, mother...

// goonies vs. E.T. //

Maybe if I had another chance, I would give another chance to you
Ooh, If I make another wish, I'll wish for another wish for you (For you)
One, two

Egads you heard of these lads
The myth how we made a grip never rode dick
Truly the Cadillac of how to contract L's on the quick
Stick 'em up slick talker no tricks
Its the funniest shit, finally the money up
And print on the kid and the planet hit skids
Livin' in a valley of flames like "I win"
Skyline ablaze in a Bob Ross pic
You don't have to acknowledge I'm raw give a shit
Never nah you can talk of me fond when I'm gone
Bad news bear on the lawn with big claws
Tryna hold our whole lives in its paws and applaud
Swear to god damn the whole city odd
Make a romance hard we got scars for hearts
Shit for odds baby living in a one chance LARP
So I stick to the art, Oh my god I'm
Ultra mag, put cash in bag
Running through dead zone hope I don't crash
Tenor saw motherfuck ring it up fast
Be alarmed ima harm what I can and then dash
Fuck y'all got another planet on stash?
Far from the fact of the flames of our trash?
That is not snow it is ash and you gotta know
The past got a wrath it's a lover gone mad
But I promise

Baby, if I had another chance, I would give another chance to you
If I make another wish, I would wish for a wish for you
But the brass on the magic lamp's damn near rubbed through
It's been wish after wish after wish after wish
And the chances are that none are comin' true

Amazing ain't it how we made it and didn't fake it
Life's a disguise, the truth is butt naked
Used to be a time I'd see it and not say it
Now I understand that woke folk be playin'
Ain't no revolution is televised and digitized
You've been hypnotized and twitter-ized by silly guys
Cues to the evenin' news, make sure you ill-advised
Got you celebratin' the generators of genocide
Any good deed is pummeled, punished and penalized
Rulers of the world will slice it up like a dinner pie
Race in a nation told you to identify
People take false pride and warfare incentivized
Fuck that, me and my tribe we on an iller vibe
We accept the role of the villains cause we been villainized
Stomped to the dirt of the Earth we still will arise
In the terror dome let me alone as I soliloqize
This is license to ill with a license to kill
This is nigga with a attitude in Beverly Hills
Heavy build with a pocket full of treasury bills
Got a fire high temper, find it hard to chill
I'm a lifetime member, fuck that fuck shit
Me and Jamie versus y'all with a knife and a musket
Now our tombstones read: "They were nothing to fuck with."
Please say that shit again Mike
"We're nothing to fuck with."

// walking in the snow //

Get a dose a dirty code to go, been cold since Co-Flow
I got wire or two unlodgin', I'll set a fire down below
I'll hang it up when you say, "Sorry, I didn't know"
Prolly got a year or ten to go so let's go
I don't really know how to go slow
Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker's cold (Ayy)
You in the wrong mode, you open and closin' your hole, it's a no go
This whole world's a shit moat, filled to the brim like GitMo
When you think it don't get mo' low it limbo 'til the sticks on flo'
All oppression's born of lies, I don't make the rules, I'm just one guy
All due respect, if getting spit on's how respect is now defined
Hungry for truth but you got screwed and drank the Kool-Aid, there's a line
It end directly at the edge of a mass grave, that's their design
Funny fact about a cage, they're never built for just one group
So when that cage is done with them and you're still poor, it come for you
The newest lowest on the totem, well golly gee, you have been used
You helped to fuel the death machine that down the line will kill you too (Oops)
Pseudo-Christians, y'all indifferent
Kids in prisons ain't a sin? Shit
If even one scrap a what Jesus taught connected, you'd feel different
What a disingenuous way to piss away existence, I don't get it
I'd say you lost your goddamn minds if y'all possessed one to begin with

Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker cold
Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker cold
Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker cold
Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker cold (Cold, cold)

Yeah, ho, Gangsta Boo, Run the Jewels
We back on our shit, and it's cold as fuck

The way I see it you're probably freest from the ages one to four
Around the age of five you're shipped away for your body to be stored
They promise education, but really they give you tests and scores
And they predictin' prison population by who scoring the lowest
And usually the lowest scores the poorest and they look like me
And every day on evening news they feed you fear for free
And you so numb you watch the cops choke out a man like me
And 'til my voice goes from a shriek to whisper, "I can't breathe"
And you sit there in the house on couch and watch it on TV
The most you give's a Twitter rant and call it a tragedy
But truly the travesty, you've been robbed of your empathy
Replaced it with apathy, I wish I could magically
Fast forward the future so then you can face it
And see how fucked up it'll be
I promise I'm honest, they coming for you
The day after they comin' for me
I'm readin' Chomsky, I read Bukowski
I'm layin' low for a week
I said somethin' on behalf of my people
And I popped up in Wikileaks
Thank God that I'm covered, the devil is smothered
And you know the evil don't sleep
Dick Gregory told me a couple of secrets before he laid down in his grave
All of us serve the same masters, all of us nothin' but slaves
Never forget in the story of Jesus, the hero was killed by the state

Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker cold
Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker cold
Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker cold
Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker cold (Cold, cold)

Who really wanna run it with the Jewel Runners?
Go hellfire hot in a new sauna
It's a cold winter baby and a cruel summer
I suicide bomb in the blue Hummer
And emerge out the side, not a bruise on 'em
Bad news come in two son, do somethin'
Treat beats like a wet thigh, chew on 'em
Got a stroke row crew on 'em, move on 'em
We be the heroes, the breakers of chains and the busters of locks (Locks, locks)
You be them suckers supportin' them snitches that talk to the cops
This the Illmatic of turning your face into fucker foie gras
I'm not so sure opportunities knocking, it's prolly the law
Word to the old school tape decks
I get Radio Raheem respect
My Nike pendant sacred, similar to the Ghostface bracelet
Fire in the hole, oh no joke
Prolly go broke just off smoke
Fuck are we gonna do, not smoke?
Get a job, play the role, be adults?
Nah, I'ma do me, arigato

First of all, they cheated (Uh-huh)
'Cause if one of them black and the other one white (Uh-huh)
So if you don't like 'em, you automatically racist (Ah, oh, well)

// JU$T //

Mastered economics 'cause you took yourself from squalor (Slave)
Mastered academics 'cause your grades say you a scholar (Slave)
Mastered Instagram 'cause you can instigate a follow (Shit)
Look at all these slave masters posin' on yo' dollar (Get it, yeah)

Look at all these slave masters (Ayy) posin' on yo' dollar (Get it, yeah)
Look at all these slave masters (Ayy) posin' on yo' dollar (Get it)
Look at all these slave masters (Ayy) posin' on yo' dollar (Get it, yeah)
Look at all these slave masters

Ayy
Business time, I'm on mine, I be mindin' mine (Make money)
Every time on my grind, I'm just tryna shine (Stay sunny)
Make a dollar, government, they want a dozen dimes (No cap)
The petty kind, might kill ya 'cause they see you shine (Stay strapped)
I done had to have a talk with myself many times (For real)
Am I a hypocrite 'cause I know I did plenty crimes? (Yes, I'm is)
I get broke too many times, I might slang some dimes (Back to trappin')
You believe corporations runnin' marijuana? (How that happen? Ooh)
And your country gettin' ran by a casino owner (Ooh)
Pedophiles sponsor all these fuckin' racist bastards (They do)
And I told you once befo' that you should kill your master (It's true)
Now that's the line that's probably gon' get my ass assassinated (Yeah-yeah, yeah)

Master of these politics, you swear that you got options (Slave, yeah)
Master of opinion 'cause you vote with the white collar (Slave)
The Thirteenth Amendment says that slavery's abolished (Shit)
Look at all these slave masters posin' on yo' dollar (Get it)

Look at all these slave masters (Ayy) posin' on yo' dollar (Get it, yeah)
Look at all these slave masters (Ayy) posin' on yo' dollar (Get it)
Look at all these slave masters (Ayy) posin' on yo' dollar (Get it, yeah)
Look at all these slave masters

(Confucius said)
Man, you better thug out, get the bag and then bug out (Uh)
Try to run home, you might run your luck out
'Cause just when your bases loaded
They'll roll a grenade in the dugout (You're out)
Earth folk, not a mellow bunch
We got our thumbs in the air like hell or bust (Uh)
Look at who we done blessed with our trust
I dont think we'll be left with too much
Hand on my heart and my mind on my drugs
Got a Vonnegut punch for your Atlas shrugs
They love to not love it's just that dumb
Lord, sweet Buddha please make me numb
Brain bounce off walls like a sentient Roomba
Just found out his creator's stupid
Lit by the supermoon, I'm too lucid
Plus got shrooms in the blood, I'm zoomin'
Beep beep, Richie, this is New York City
The X on the map where the pain keep hitting
Just us ducks here sitting
Where murderous chokehold cops still earnin' a livin'
Funny how some say money don't matter
That's rich now, isn't it, get it? Comedy
Try to sell a pack a smokes to get food
Get killed and it's not an anamoly
But hey, it's just money

Mastered economics 'cause you took yourself from squalor (Slave, yeah)
Mastered academics 'cause your grades say you a scholar (Slave)
Mastered Instagram 'cause you can instigate a follow (Shit, yeah)
Look at all these slave masters (Yeah-yeah)
Let it sink in (Yeah)

2020, run the map
Raw, uncut, yeah my hourglass
Don't watch it spill to the bottom half
You see the piece, now run it fast
On the tarmac, in a starter jack
C4 when I run it back
Like a track star, run a record lap?
Nah, like when his needle catch (Yeah)
Clean look, poet pugilist
A shooters view, a Zapruder flick (Yeah)
Too rude for ya rudiments
Who convinced you you could move against the crew?
In this, comin' up through the fence
Off shore outta Port-au-Prince (Yeah)
Overture left his fingerprints
On our hearts at the gate and the world our residence
How can we be the peace?
When the beast gonna reach for the worst (Yeah)
Tear all the flesh off the Earth
Stage set for a deafening reckoning
Quick like the pace of a verse
So I'm questioning this quest for things
As a recipe for early death threatening (Yeah)
But the breath in me is weaponry
For you, it's just money

// never look back //

81 miles to the hour down road
Never looked back never ever went slow
Never look back heard 'em say that before
Never look back never stare at a ghost
BK air in the summer time choke
Ain't shit fly but the drones, oh no
Low on the smokes grab another pack, go
Pops smoked too when playing piano
Pops I'm you it's funny how that go
Mom you too I never could drink slow
Never look back heard 'em say that before
Sound like the type of advice I'd ignore
Funny how time feel off tick tock
You thinking deaths beat it drop a clock shot
Never smoke sad, I heard that's a thought
I got 44 bucks on the smoke, whatchu got?

Got my mind on a mission, on the road to perdition
The Crime and the grind, I'll admit it, I'm wit it
Must've suckle up crime for my mama right titty
Cause if a dollar made cents, no question she was with it
She was queenpen-ing, independent, when I was a kiddy
Uncle Luke don't stop, get it-get it, Magic City
Mama told me never give a nigga my plug
Then she told me never give these bitches my love
Still 'til this day, bruh, I'm missing my girl
Still 'til this day, I'm perfectin' my thug
Daddy told me never give a honey my money
Had to ask Daddy, "Did that include mommy?"
Made dollar, made cents, made money-money-money
Got a wife built like a Playboy bunny
Fucked up, but I kept her 'cause I kept it a hunnid
Made a mil, that's for real, ain't a damn thing funny

Ne-never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back

So here's the play: You can't go forward and you can't go back. The past, the present, the future, all irrelevant. The only thing that matters is latitude, gratitude is everything, time is nothing

81 when I moved to the county where the kings is
Walk past St. James place where the king lived
Think quick, never saw class a delinquent
Now I get cash for the beats and the sync chips
Smart ass kid with a mean lip
Mom said J gonna speak, better mean it (Deepness)
Now I'm on fleek as a preset
I don't wear a leash in the least but I'm beast-en
Never look back, you will only get bitter
If you get bitter, you will never get better
Never get better, then you never get bigger
Never get bigger then you never make cheddar
Tell the truth fella, you were never really special
You were just a lame nigga with a hit record
Yo' time came and it changed like the weather
Run The Jewels muthafucka, we still forever

Ne-never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back

// the ground below //

RTJ
The God

The God killer
This Tokyo and I'm Godzilla
Playing blackjack versus death
Gun on the card dealer
Just bought a Demon, I'm screaming up out the car dealer
The last temptation of Mike but I'm a god figure
Tell Beelzebub that God don't need a job
If I did the oligarchs would be missing, murdered and robbed
This is Bonaparte playing with Toussaint
And they went on a world conquest tearing your bone apart
Michael remained murderous
But still virtuous, wait to kill the petty and foul at the church services
Not a holy man but I'm moral in my perverseness
So I support the sex workers unionizing their services

You say that love me (Ayy)
I'm guessing I'ma be okay
You say that you don't feel me now
I feel like I'ma live somehow
Your love never meant much to me (Ayy)
Love never meant much to me (Ayy)
Love never meant much to me (Uhn uh)
Love never meant much

Born from the ether I just appeared out a cloud of reefer
Screamin' "Fuck the world" it can drink what's coming out my urethra
I'll slap a dying child he don't pronounce my name correct
Rules have gotta be rules any exceptions and I'm not a leader
Think in the box I'm not getting my fix then shit is iffy
Felate a donut hole wife don't get to the crib and quickly
I'll watch my mouth when I'm finished watching y'all suck clout
Don't doubt you put an ounce of that evil on me I'm flippin', Ricky
I give a inch to you simps, I'll never forgive me
Not saying it's a conspiracy but you're all against me
You see a future where Run the Jewels ain't the shit
Cancel my Hitler-killing trip
Turn the time machine back around a century

You say that love me (Ayy)
I'm guessing I'ma be okay
You say that you don't feel me now
I feel like I'ma live somehow
Your love never meant much to me (Ayy)
Love never meant much to me
Love never meant much to me (Uhn uh)
Love never meant much

Every child, woman and man
Opinion don't matter stick to your plan
If they judge, still don't budge
Don't give a inch don't give a nudge
Life a bitch, leave you battered and bent
Lose or win, gotta hold up your chin
And I put it on Jamie and me
We just gave you inspiration for free
The money never meant much

// pulling the pin //

Yeah
Yeah, that cash
Yeah, take it, here

From a long line of the rancidest swine came the violators
The cloven foot designers of high crime for the iron ages
Twisting down through time, see them tryna unwind creation
Don't be surprised, it's a mistake to think their influence had faded
Well, what a wretched state of danger we've made here
I thought to me, "Perhaps explaining years of self lobotomy, toxicly
Perhaps explaining tears and even tears in my cosmology"
You numb yourself for years and it can wear upon you, honestly
These old foxes got a lotta plots to out fox us (Ayy)
Tryna divvy up and dump in corresponding boxes, how obnoxious
Where the heart and mind connect, expect them targeting like archers
You will not travel towards the light if they're in charge of your departure
You'd think the universe forgot us the way the cursed pitch their product (Woo)
As though our spirits not a fire that can't be snuffed or turned to dollars
Or the expanse across all space, can't be contained in one small dollop
Now I see that its the same moment in history back to haunt us
And here we are again
Hello void, long time watcher, first time callin' in
Every cage built needs an occupant
Got a dead bolt, see 'em lock it in
Had a good run but they stoppin' it
Wanna Walkman in the coffin lid
Eat your heart out, fiction fan
Truly the truth's the stranger document

And at best I'm just getting it wrong
And at worst I've been right from the start
It hurts, I'm bein' torn apart
Theres a grenade in my heart
And the pin is in their palm
There's a grenade
There's a grenade
A grenade in my heart

At best I feel difficult, poor and you pitiful
Then everyday's like a satanic ritual
Beautiful soul with the rogue and the criminal
How long must the Holy hold onto they principles?
Kickin' and screamin' while watchin' the demons
Collecting the gold and the diamond residuals
My pastor say, "God has promised us paradise, live a good life it is pivotal"
I promised my mama that I would stay honest
But I want it all in the physical
And promise I'm honest, I'll probably be punished
'Cause keeping that promise too difficult
So picture me red as I sit on the bed
With my hands on my head and this pistol too
Why the fuck must I be miserable?
The devils, they do the despicable
And still, they move like they invincible
These filthy criminals, sit at the pinnacle
Doin' the typical, keepin' us miserable
Takin' the most and providin' the minimal
Hate to sound cynical but shit is pitiful, times is just critical
Like Jimmy Seville, they cheerfully kill kids in a ritual
I'll murder the miserables, I'll make it all biblical
I'll cut off their heads, they'll beg for their lives and I'll put it up, digital
Fuck the political, the mission is spiritual
Our murder is miracle, that was sent here to just punish through terror

Static in my mind
Like sanity on borrowed time
Like right and wrong can't be defined
There's a grenade in my heart
And the pin is in their palm
There's a grenade
There's a grenade
A grenade in my heart

// a few words for the firing squad (radiation) //

[El-P:]
I woke up early once again that's four days straight
I didn't wake you baby, I just watched you lay
In the radiation of the city sun
I am in love with you, it is my only grace (Woo)
You know how everything can seem a little out of place?
All of my life that's seemed to be the only normal state
So feelin' normal never really meant me feelin' sane
And bein' clear about the truth and bein' sane have never really been the same
I used to wanna get the chance to show the world I'm smart (Ha)
Isn't that dumb? I shouldâve focused mostly on my heart
âCause I seen smarter people trample life like it's an art
So bein' smart ain't what it used to be, that's fuckin' dark
You ever notice that the worst of us have all the chips?
It really kinda takes the sheen off people getting rich
Like maybe rich is not the holy ever lovin' king of nothin' fuckers
Know we know youâre bluffin'
You are dealing with the motherfuckin' money-money runners

[Killer Mike:]
Itâd be a lie if I told you that I ever disdained the fortune and fame
But the presence of the pleasure never abstained me from any of the pain
When my mother transitioned to another plane I was sitting on a plane
Tellin' her to hold on and she tried hard but she just couldn't hang
Been two years, truth is I'll probably never be the same
Dead serious, it's a chore not to let myself go insane
It's crippling, make you want lean on a cup of promethazine
But my queen say she need a king, not another junkie, flunky rapper fiend
Friends tell her he could be another Malcom, he could be another Martin
She told her partner I need a husband more than the world need another martyr
Made in Atlanta, Georgia, where I use to ride the MARTA
With a empty .22 in the front pocket of my Braves starter
Tryna make it out the mud as a baby father is much harder
The same children that you love, and adore, the court will use to break and rob ya
Circumstance woulda broke weaker man, but I put it on my momma
I'm a man of honor and the hardship made me a better money runner

[El-P:]
This is for the never heard, never even get a motherfuckin' word
This is for my sister Sarah, honey, I feel sorry you were hurt (Hey)
This is for the dawn, momma took a knock, had to change the locks
Dusted up but brushed off and I watched talk about a boss
For the holders of a shred a heart even when you wanna fall apart
When your surrounded by the fog, treadin' water in the ice cold dark
When they got you you feelin' like a fox runnin' from another pack a dogs
Put the pistol and the fist up in the air, we are there, swear to God

[Killer Mike:]
Black child in America, the fact that I made it was magic
Black and beautiful, the world broke my momma heart, and she died an addict
God blessed me to redeem her in my thought, words and my actions
Satisfaction for The Devil, goddammit, heâll never ever have it
This is for the do-gooders that the no-gooders used and then abused
For the truth tellers tied to the whippin' post, left beaten, battered, bruised
For the ones whose body hung from a tree like a piece of strange fruit
Go hard, last words to the firing squad was, "Fuck you too"

// ooh la la (Remix) //

Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la

Yeah, ah, ooh, la la, it's Young Mula-la
Me no do ra-ra, boom boom, kumbaya
Vroom vroom, zoom by ya
Me and me goon brada
Mario brother shroom power make me doom doom da da
Bougie thot, I call her Bougie Banton
She like sushi and opera but her coochie aqua
What's a goon to a goblin? What's a shooter to a shotta?
I can boom shakalaka your medulla oblongata
Kill a mic like El-P and Killer Mike, feeling like
DJ Premier, it's my world premiere tonight, feeling right
Hair trigger softer than a pillow fight
No computer, but this MAC got more shots than gigabytes
Bigger teeth, bigger bite, bigger holes in the wall
Money tall, ego small, blunt is long as a log
Mask is off, nothin' to lose, classy God, Sunday school
Run up a check and run your mouth
We run you down, Run The Jewels
Lil Tune (Tune)

Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ah, oui oui)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Mon cheri, mon cheri)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la

Lookin' for M's like I lost a friend
Jump out of my bed like, "Where the bread?"
You gon' hold the egg, waiter bring the check
When we talk, we Kalashnikov, keep us in your thoughts
Fully dressed at the crack of dawn, weapons letting off
I can hear them from the block, see them creeping through the fog
Season's greetings, now feeding season can start, oh my God
Look alive, lookin' like I live life on a crooked line
Doin' fine, you want maximum stupid, I am the guy

First of all, fuck the fuckin' law, we is fuckin' raw
Steak tartare, oysters on the half-shell, sushi bar
Life a bitch and the pussy fish, still fucked her raw
I'm a dog, I'm a dirty dog, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ol' Dirty Bastard, go in your jaw, shimmy shimmy ya
Got the semi in the hemi, goin' "Gimme, gimme, y'all"
Pugilistic, my linguistics are Jeru the Damaja
And I rap it pornographic, bitch, set up the camera

Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (I need a bottle of MoÃ«t, ho, come on)
Ooh, la la (GarÃ§on)

You covet disruption, I got you covered, I'm bussin' (Bussin')
My brother's a runner, he's crushin', it's no discussion ('Scussion)
I used to be munchkin, I wasn't 'posed to be nothin' (Nothin')
Y'all fuckers corrupted and up to somethin' disgusting
My pockets are plumper this season, I love to cuff 'em
I'm afraid of nothin' but nothingness, ain't it something?
Warmongers are dumpin', they'll point and click at your pumpkin (Look out)
Your suffering is scrumptious, they'll put your kids in the oven

Fuck a king or queen and all of they loyal subjects
I pull my penis out and I piss on they shoes in public
People, we the pirates, the pride of this great republic
No matter what you order, muhfucker, we what you're stuck with (Sorry)
I used to love Bruce, but livin' my vida loca
Helped me understand I'm probably more of a Joker
When we usher in chaos, just know that we did it smiling
Cannibals on this island, inmates run the asylum

Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la la (DJ Premier)

Ooh, la la
Ooh, la-, la, la
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la, la, la, la, la
Ah, oui, ah, oui, ah
Ah, ah, oui, oui

// No Save Point //

[El-P:]
R-T-motherfuckin'-J
R-T-J
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, hey)
Ayy (Hey, oh)
Ayy (Oh, hey, oh)
Ayy

I swallow all my drugs 'til the pain is unplugged
When the laws of entropy touch, you better dread the judge
Wiser men than us been crushed to fine dust
When the fortune cookie tell me I'm fucked, I just shrug
A note like a broken electrical pulse hum
For the done, for the scum of the circuitry on the run
Haven't seen the sun with the naked eye much
So the neon is my God and it shine on the numb
Hop off of the bike, gun cocked, okay, ready
Work ain't been too steady, I'm headed for something heavy
If you got the credits, I'll pull the crime of the century
Morality's only a memory when belly's empty
Swine get they hive mind focused on taking mine
Get in line, swine, you won't deny me my piece of pie
Any fucker in this broke future that they designed
Don't comply? I'll supply you deletion, the end is nigh

[Killer Mike:]
(Hey, oh)
(Oh, hey, oh)
(Run the Jewels, Run the Jewels, Run the Jewels)

I-I-I used to pray to God, but I think he took a vacation
'Cause now the state of Cali is ran by these corporations
The skyscrapers shadow the homeless, the population
The degradation they face, it should be an abomination
They body parts is stolen and sold to the richest patient
And we the mercenaries at war with the active agents
The legislators that work for the sadists that kill the babies
That die in the back of a bullet-riddled Mercedes ('Cedes)
Just to serve (Serve), murdered them and the chauffeur ('Feur)
Hit pump of herb (Herb), then my brain exit the Earth (Earth)
That's righteous, huh? (Huh) Slapping palm, holding a pump (Pump)
Keanu Reeves, cyber arm under my sleeve (Sleeve)
I blast 'em all, watch 'em fall like autumn leaves
Damn it, I can't leave, Night City keep calling me
Goddamn it, I'm a G, and this fuck shit is all it need
Life a fucking bitch, but this bitch ain't divorcing me (Nuh-uh)

// the ground below (Royal Jewels Mix) //

You say that you don't love me (Ayy)
I'm guessin' I'ma be okay
You say that you don't feel me now
I feel like I'ma live somehow
Your love never meant much to me
Love never meant much to me (R-T-J)
Your love never meant much to me (The God)

The God killer, this Tokyo and I'm Godzilla
Playing blackjack versus death, gun on the card dealer
Just bought a Demon, I'm screamin' up out the car dealer
The last temptation of Mike, but I'm a God figure
Tell Beelzebub that the God don't need a job
And if I did, the oligarchs would be missing, murdered and robbed
This is Bonaparte and he paired with Toussaint
And they went on a world conquest, tearing your bone apart
Michael remained murderous, but still virtuous
Wait to kill the petty and foul at the church services
Not a holy man, but I'm moral in my perverseness
So I support the sex workers unionizing their services

You say that you don't love me (Ayy)
I'm guessin' I'ma be okay
You say that you don't feel me now
I feel like I'ma live somehow
Your love never meant much to me
Love never meant much to me
Your love never meant much to me
Your love never meant much

Born from the ether, I just appeared out a cloud of reefer
Screamin' "Fuck the world," it can drink what's coming out my urethra
I'll slap a dying child, he don't pronounce my name correct
Rules have gotta be rules, any exceptions and I'm not a leader
Think in the box, I'm not getting my fix, then shit is iffy
Felate a donut hole wife don't get to the crib and quickly
I'll watch my mouth when I'm finished watching y'all suck clout
Don't doubt you put an ounce of that evil on me, I'm flippin', Ricky
I give a inch to you simps, I'll never forgive me
Not saying it's a conspiracy, but you're all against me
You see a future where Run the Jewels ain't the shit
Cancel my Hitler-killing trip
Turn the time machine back around a century

You say that you don't love me (Ayy)
I'm guessin' I'ma be okay
You say that you don't feel me now
I feel like I'ma live somehow
Your love never meant much to me
Love never meant much to me
Your love never meant much to me
Your love never meant much

Much, much, much, much
Much, much, much, much
Much, much, much, much
Much, much, much, much

Every child, woman and man
Opinion don't matter, stick to your plan
If they judge, still don't budge
Don't give a inch, don't give a nudge (Nudge)
Life a bitch, leave you battered and bent
Lose or win, gotta hold up your chin (Chin)
And I put it on Jaime and me
We just gave you inspiration for free
The money never meant much
