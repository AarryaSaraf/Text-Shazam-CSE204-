// Bust No Moves //

[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Early morning riser reefer chiefer
You paid the most but me, I get it cheaper
Strong rapper reefer, wrap it in a big cohiba
I get so high I close my eyes and swore that I saw Jesus
I take another toke and God damn I feel comatose
I double cup and that's what's up and then I'm leaning fool
I'm talking any given Sunday, Willie Beamen ho
My bitch say that I get too high it might kill my brain
I tell her that she talk too much and she should give some brain
We used to fuck a lot but now you just fuss and complain
What a fuckin' shame, hit the door and hit the block
Avoid the walking dead, the zombies still hunt and rob
My days of wasting time, slanging dimes is way behind
I'm still tryna be a mover with a Mason's mind
I will get a mil, ain't nobody taking mine
You sorry suckers, see you saps at the finish line
You know I steady grind

[Hook: SL Jones]
I stay higher than Messiah, I ain't never grinding
You see them Jewel runners coming, but we body body
We bout that LPP we diggin' other people's pockets
Keep it cool, Run the Jewels, ain't no other way around it
I want the rings and the chains, Run the Jewels
I want the watches and the bracelets, Run the Jewels
We at the table eating everybody food
Invasion of the chains, snatchers better not bust a move

[Verse 2: El-P]
I'm a dummy I'm running with more than fucking scissors
I'm the Cadillac, of fuck you, back off me you bitches
You the Cadillac of âFuck, I just suck at this rap shit"
I'm the Cadillac of "Suck it, I'm fucking disastrous"
We the Hardy and Thom of the plant a bomb game
The lead em all to the mall and set 'em off game
You wanna hang like Hussein
Eat a mile of my shit then put your lips to my true brain
And get the hash tag #fartnoise
I used to give a half-fuck, now I just laugh
I barely blink when it gets bad, maybe I'm crass
I pull the ducts out my eyes, I don't cry, I just can't
Killer Mike brought the fire pack
Light it off the sinners of the city where the riots at
The living fuck boy eraser
Carve initials in the wet cement right where you died at

[Hook: SL Jones]

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
Who wanna run a summer with the jewel runners?
Got your girlfriend hotter than two summers
Everybody tough til they see them two's on em
Then they do a number two in they True Religions
"Lord please don't shoot!", they get too religious
Truth is we go vicious on these stool pigeons
Pistol pointed at they missus like I killed these bitches
We Run the Jewels and when we talking pimpin', pay attention

[Verse 4: El-P]
Run the Jewels we a bit odd
We bad news, you barely get a fat chance to slim odds
You barely get a short plank for long walks, taught like a sawn-off
No laws when I taught, nah
And I'm kalashnikov spitting
We always take the time to smell the rose when it wither
I'd say better luck tomorrow
But the horror of your life is me and Mike are just beginning

// Let's Go (The Royal We) //

Let's go!
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?

Anarchists put a flame to a tire, walk around with the fire round necks
Mankind gotta deal with a new kind of mind I'm a quick death wrapped in a threat
Tell these fuzzy little weak-heart bunny babies back up or get wet
Never mind where you draw the line, I got a mind for crime, it's all disrespect
I'm a oil rig fire in the flesh, you're a lunchbox walking erect
Tasty treats from the lungs to the flesh of the neck
Who's hungry? The table's set, come get it
Pain is a game then you better run with it, have fun with it, enjoy your suffering
Kernel panic, terminal rushin'
Empty the clip while your clip's still bufferin'

Look in the eye of the violent and villainous
We are the murderous militants
We are the pirates that hide on the island invade or we wilding
Marauding and murdering merchantmen
We have been cursed by the curs
We shooting first on our turf
Pay us our proper respect
You pray for your God to end the perverse
He sent the worst of the worst
Every death demon disperse
We put them all in a hearse
We put them under the earth
We are the savages ravaging hell
Death in the air, we relish the smell
We are the hand of the Lord
We are the hand with the sword
Taking the heads of the faith
We are the sealers of fate
We are the fangs of the snake

Let's go!
Huh?
Huh?
Let's go!
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?

The enemies of the state
Pardon me, your mistake
See, I'm raised to eat pain
Appetite for sliced face
Me and Mike mount the Hellcat
Armed to the pearl-whites like yikes!
Twenty cents gets your ghost ejected
It's free now, go to the light
Me and Mike bring D'Lite to the knife fight
Get twenty-nine grand sliced
Me, I just take it light
Might light twenty-nine grand up in a night
Tongue lash slash in defiance
Born to brawl boy, the bastard alliance
Hardy-harr, you a laugh, I'm a riot
That's not a brag, that's SCIENCE!

Back from the bellows of hell
Back from the back of a jail in the cell
Back from the gun and the priest to the con and the creed
Back to the streets from the East
Back to the belly of beast
Back to the place of my peace
Back to me holding my piece
Anything working disturbing that peace
Will certainly meet the deceased, capiche?
Oh, why must I tell 'em again?
What must I tell 'em, my friend?
That we are born into sin
And we are worshiping murderers
Nothing but evil duplicitous men
I know you heard of 'em all
We should just murder 'em all
We should just murder and ball
We dance on the ruins we looting from all of they palace's walls

Let's go!
Huh?
Huh?
Let's go!
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?

// Mean Demeanor //

[Killer Mike:]
A warrior, my story glory-bound and war-renowned
Amongst the poor, the sick, and shut-eye where my story found
I overcame every obstacle that's every placed
The gods have promised, victory will one day know my face
Won't be denied the pride, won't be denied my prize
RTJ all day, any day, everyday 'round here
Beat you and these other guys
Don't know, don't care, don't really give a fuck
So long as they know don't fuck with mine
And let it be known, and truth be shone
We kill shit dead, no compromise

[El-P:]
El-Producto, now wild boy stuff, spittin' dust
Pain and rain, we know angels dump
El-Tornado on all y'all chumps
[Killer Mike:]
This that run and bump
That fee-fi-fo-fum, attack and smack a chump
This that killer spit
That villainous, vicious, venomous El-Tornado kick (kick, kick, kick)
[El-P:]
Don't doubt we will mow down you dogs
No clout to spend here at all, we will now clown you all
Go shout it to the gods, "RTJ's arrived
To make your minion cry! ", burn our image in her eyes
Better get a little bit of that zen shit in ya
I'm a long hitter, but defile the fuck outta frog rap dinner
How the fuck El-Produc' get bigger, better, meaner?
Living like a sinner, mean demeanor
Eat a bleeding, screaming, mean leader
Back to the ether (ether, ether, ether)

[El-P:] Bigger, better, meaner
[Killer Mike:] Ain't no days off 'til the very last breath
[El-P:] Bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, better, better, meaner, meaner
[Killer Mike:] Ain't no days off 'til the very last breath, movin', movin' like a
[El-P:] Bigger, better, meaner
[Killer Mike:]
Ain't no days off, move, move, move, move like a boss
Move, move, move, move, move like a boss
[Killer Mike:] 'Til the, 'til the, 'til the very last breath
[El-P:] Bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, better, meaner
'Til the, 'til the, 'til the, 'til the very last breath
[El-P:] Bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger
Better, better, meaner, meaner, meaner
[Killer Mike:] 'til the very last breath
[El-P:] Bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger
[Killer Mike:] 'til the very last breath
[El-P:] Better, better, better, better
[Killer Mike:] 'til the very last breath
[El-P:] Meaner, meaner, meaner, meaner
[Killer Mike:]
'Til the very last breath
They, they, they, they, they know they soft

// Nobody Speak (Phil Spectro Remix) //

Picture this, I'm a bag of dicks, put me to your lips
I am sick, I will punch a baby bear in his shit
Give me lip, I'ma send you to the yard, get a stick
Make a switch, I can end the conversation real quick
I am crack, I ain't lyin', kick a lion in his crack
I'm the shit, I will fall off in your crib, take a shit
Pinch your momma on the booty, kick your dog, fuck your bitch
Fat boy dressed up like he's Santa and took pictures with your kids
We the best, we will cut a frowny face in your chest
Little wench, I'm unmentionably fresh, I'm a mensch
Get correct, I will walk into a court while erect
Screaming, "Yes, I am guilty, motherfuckers, I am death"
Ayy, you wanna hear a good joke?
Nobody speak, nobody get choked

Ayy, get running, start pumping your bunions, I'm coming
I'm the dumbest, who flamethrow your function to Funyuns
Flame your crew quicker than Trump fucks his youngins
Now face the flame, fuckers, your fame and fate's done with
I rob Charlie Brown, Peppermint Patty, Linus and Lucy
Put coke in the doobie, roll woolies to smoke with Snoopy
I still remain that dick-grabbin' slacker that spit a loogie
'Cause the toter of the toolie'll murder you friggin' moolies

Nobody speak, nobody gettin' choked, hey
Nobody speak, nobody gettin' choked, hey
Nobody speak

Only facts, I will shoot a baby duck if it quacks with a Ruger
Top billin', come cops some villainous shots
It's boxed, shipped out and bought and y'all feeling it
El-P killin' it, Killer Mike killin' shit
What more can I say? We top billin' it
Valiant without villainy, viciously foul victory
Burn towns and villages, burning, looting and pillaging
Murderers try to hurt us, we curse them and all their children
I just want the bread and bologna bundles to tuck away
I don't work for free, I am barely giving a fuck away
So tell beggin' Johnny and Mommy to get the fuck away
Ayo, here's a gun, son, now run, get it the gutterway
Live to shoot another day
Fuck out of here

Nobody speak, nobody gettin' choked, hey
Nobody speak

// Rubble Kings Theme (Dynamite On The Street) //

[Intro: Killer Mike]
I've seen Ak-47s
I've seen sawed off shotguns
I've seen all of this
I've seen dynamite on the streets

[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Surrounded by violence and murder
Say, we in the streets and we grippin' on heat
You got beef then we fryin' your burger
My shoes on my feet and my words and my balls
Is all I got, fuck with a murda
Will happen to you, I am certain
I'm certain as hell and I'm grippin' the tail of Satan himself: the serpent
We pullin' in no social service
We go in the store, they look nervous
So down me to hell, damn me to jail, like fuck you, we robbin' the merchants
The preachers sound silly in service
Convincin' my mama that all of the drama must certainly serve higher purpose
How fightin' could turn into curses
When I tell her any god that make it plenty hard really ain't worth it to worship
Man, I believe in my patches, man I believe in my fists
Man, I believe in bandanas and pistols and holdin' down, rockin' my sets
Born into turmoil and trouble, I became King of the Rubble

[Hook:]
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy dynamite
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy dynamite
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy
Dynamite on the streets
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy dynamite
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy dynamite
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy
Dynamite on the streets

[Verse 2: El-P]
Everythin' out here is broken, or blemished and battered, and tattered, but mine
You let it burn and decay and created the kings of the cinder divine
I am done asking and pleading and begging you recognize I am alive
You are done walking inside of the section youâre treading in, there was a line
Cement block, hard rock, it don't stop, get it, get it
Your whole block's soft, it comes off like skittish bitches
We're wolves to the bitter finish
Not full, gotta get it in, get it? get us dinner
Violators tryna finish any little sentence, we will sentence sinners
It all stinks, but where we live is where the set's sinkin'
They say sorry son accept it, same old song of the subjectors
Sorry sirs, but we don't sing along to anthems or your pledges
In your garbage rose the rulers of the restless, do not test us

[Hook:]
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy dynamite
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy dynamite
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy
Dynamite on the streets
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy dynamite
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy dynamite
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy
Dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy, dy
Dynamite on the streets
