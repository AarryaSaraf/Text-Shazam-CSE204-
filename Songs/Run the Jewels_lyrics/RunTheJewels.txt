Album: RunTheJewels

// Run The Jewels //

[El-P:]
Oh dear what the fuck have we here?
These motherfuckers all thorn no rose
Egads what a bad dream better not sleep
Take a No-Doz, do some blow
Oh shit what the hell have we done?
It's alive and it's hungry as fuck
Better hide all the snacks and the dough
It is out of my control, you are shit out of luck
I don't wanna be unfair but the pair
We got beat that weak shit you got (true god)
Blew up the spot with that new bop
Crew drops, do up ya squad without nuance
I don't wanna sound unkind but the
Sounds I make are the sounds of the hounds
That are howlin - Under your bed I'm here growling
Same time under the blanket you're cowering

[Killer Mike:]
Cowering like cowards cowering on
Concrete showers in Rikers Island
Victims, we the wolves that's wilding
We often smile at sights of violence
Acting brave and courageous
Ain't advantageous for health and safety
So when we say run the jewels
Just run' em baby, please don't delay me
And that goes for a guy or lady
The fam god damn we fuckin crazy
I'll pull this pistol
Put it on your poodle or your fuckin baby
She clutched the pearls, said "What in the world!"
And "I won't give up shit!"
I put the pistol on that poodle
And I shot that bitch

[Hook:]
Run the jewels...[x2]

[El-P:]
And the crowd chants "Get that paper!"
And the mob says "Kill that witch!"
This city get mad to the max
Better wave bye-de bye to the high scrapes kids
Get a tin foil hat for the rain, in
Hot water from the roof to the basement
I'mma smoke 'til the planet erases
Build a white flag out of Zig Zags, wave it

[Killer Mike:]
Often I'm smoking coffin
Sip lean on a bean like Boston
My young bitch here fine like
Pam Grier when she made that movie Coffy
But when my wife's in town
Ay Jackie Brown just stay up off me
Cause if they don't somebody get shot
And they gon' buy a coffin

[El-P:]
With the pull of a pin a grenade
Get a crowd to they feet and a soul to its options
I'm a fool for the win I been made
To be loud while these other cats drowning in softness
In a urn or the dirt get tossed in
With a grin or a smirk get accosted
I'm a sin on the verse like a kid in a hearse
Or a nun in a cum shot (stop it)

[Killer Mike:]
Big beast in a cage with a heart
Full of rage, it seems I can't behave
You could try till you die, oh well
You failed, it seems the world can't be saved
These streets is full with the wolves
That starve for the week so they after the weak
In a land full of lambs I am
And I'll be damned if I don't show my teeth

[Hook]

// Banana Clipper //

[Killer Mike:]
I move with the elegance of an African elephant
I presented the evidence eloquent as the president
Evident is the emphasis, I deserve me a championship
But before I banana clip I'mma chill so my man can rip

[El-P:]
Little man against Hellion with the heart of an orphan
I got the words of a murderer and an eye for distortion
You take a slice of my portion, I'll take a piece of your profit
I drive at illegal speeds, Keep an O.Z in my pocket

[Killer Mike:]
We run the jewels in your town, a quarter pound on my person
I'm known for pounding the stage, I'm talking burning and cursing
Producer gave me a beat, said it's the beat of the year
I said "El-P didn't do it so get the fuck outta here!"

[El-P:]
You wanna hang, bring your throat, I got stools and a rope
I'mma slang pope, haranguing the land with a man's flow
A new edition to the art of the old code
That's fully retarded and put a part in your bold dome

[Killer Mike:]
Ay El
We the villains, we antagonist bad guys
Mercy me, merciless me putting pain in they sad eyes
It's time for Skywalker talk cause meet the true Darth Vader
I hit your mom in '03, but a G ain't ate her
So baby boy, you should tighten up and show some respect
Before I Melvin on you Jody, put my arm on your neck
Or worse yet be the reason your girl want a divorce
Be at your crib with your kids saying "fuck your fort
Lil' nigga!"

[El-P:]
The style is radiation leak at Mile Island
Also known as Chernobyl talk, listen for the sirens
For the green I'm a hoarder, you're the poor distorter
Sorta morbid sonnin' these fuckin' whoredome explorers, I'm bored
Enough of your bummy shit, it's numb to the core, sure
You suck a good dick for the fame and couldn't resist getting played
I fuck like I'm headed to war, I'm really not playing no games
But tag me god damn it I'll kill the carrier mentions my name

[Killer Mike:]
Hey, I'm a soldier of fortune, a mercenary on beat
I'm merciless, I'll torture emcees, tie up both of they feet
If they refuse to run the jewels we beat the bottoms of feet
I'm talking grip pliers, guys, to the top of your teeth
Hey me and Jaime killed the competition, top of the heap
Is where we staying when they corpses resting under our feet
I sent they mom a little cash and a sympathy letter
Told her she raised a bunch a fuck boys, next time do better
Bitch

[Big Boi:]
We the old Atlanta, new Atlanta, future of the city
Daddy Fat Saxx don't give a damn cause can't nann new niggas get with me
Now it's true, niggas are simply simple minded simple Simons
Being dumbed down by the local radio stations by designing
But what I be rhyming, no payola is required
My bank account obese as fuck while yours sits on a diet
Nigga your lease is up, you're fired
Quiet, that's how the boss talk
Retain ownership on everything, every car bought
And paid for, no neighbors cause I'm sitting on acres
Went to Vegas, jumped the broom cause I wasn't trippin' on papers
Or no prenuptual agreement for mama
If we broke up and she took half I'd still be sitting on commas
Eight figures nigga

// 36" Chain //

[Killer Mike:]
Bitch we be that shit that's right
Number two boo boo straight caca (yeah)
I smoke ganja with a dreadlocked rasta
Move like Frank you will die like a hassa
Move like Jesus die like a martyr
Hell of a choice when you riding a Lamotta
Trynna get some hoes in the hot car
How far is we away, man? Not far
The greatness they claim, not all
Are not, we are those juggernauts
Me El, we hail
Like a young Che Guevara and Fidel
Castro, cash flow, car full of females
Bad hoes, we in the DR
Any fuck rapper boy gettin' out of line I pray the preacher beat him to the goddamn ER

I spit them country rap tunes like Hee-Haw
Cocaine flow fishscale no re-rock
Take a snort for yourself shawty, see? "he raw...
(sniff) See he raw!"
Thatâs you shawty go on snort your nose off
Then put the news in the street Tom Brokaw
Cause of you shawty met a bad stone bitch out of Brooklyn and that Brooklyn bitch straight got broke off
Yeah she called her homegirl from the BX, freaky lil 'Rican brought X and we sexed
Couple months later brought 'em down to Atlanta and let 'em style on the 'bamas that's right yeah we flex
Heard she got a baby daddy and a nigga acting aggy runnin' round talkin' 'bout yeah he plexed
Nigga better pray for a ho like he Tebow though cause right now he stay losinâ like The Jets

[El-P:]
And I walk around like I got a 36" chain
And I walk around like I got a 36" chain

[El-P:]
Bitch we be that shit that's right
Light a flare put your thumbs in the air high five
I came for the stash box gimme that
I been waitin' for this all my life
3 AM and I'm still not right
Still awake still away from fading
Crazy
Psilocybin
Why the ride so hazy
Dribble this spit till the street gets wavy
The bliss and pure shit magician
Get to skipping
Not too tall dark and handsome man
But I talk dark for ransoms man
Spend grands of those zombies
Folded origami
Yes I bag the clams
Anyone object to the styles, get a smile and a backwards hand

Peep that felonious face in the place of an angel
Bringing that buckshot back to the table
Been a veteran, earthbound hellion
Try to say grace get a face full of staples
Woke up and the city air smelled like maple
If you come straight from New York you relate
If you come straight from another place stay too
Me and Mike got the whole map held safe

[Killer Mike:]
Be it NYC or the ATL
From the ceilings of heaven to the gates of hell
We murder death killed every stage we step
Homicide times two better warn yourself, El

[El-P:]
Anybody looking for some trouble better self med
We could double dutch in a minefield, hell gets
Just the right temperature, break beat minister
Riverdance cleats on your face for the finisher

// DDFH //

[Killer Mike:]
Cops in the ghetto they move like the Gestapo
Drunk off their power and greed, they often hostile
My little homie talked shit back and they beat him bad
That boy in the hospital now he's lookin' bad
And I'm with his mom and dad, we lookin' sad
My own mama called me, said "Baby, I'm just glad
They ain't put they hands on my child and kill his ass
Please don't rap about that shit 'fore they murder your black ass"
It's drones over Brooklyn, you blink you could get took-en
And now you're understanding the definition of "Crooklyn"
Pigs on parade but bacon fryin' and cookin'
Cause kids tired of dying and walkin' round like they shook-en
Cause we smoke sour to deal with the paranoia
That they charge by the hour, can't hire the Jewish lawyer
Cause if you ain't Jigga or Puff, you doing time
And even then, you might get ten, word to Shyne

[Hook:]
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Do dope, fuck hope
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey hey-hey)
Do dope, fuck hope

[El-P:]
You don't wanna look into my big crystal balls, suck the future
We'll moonwalk through flames with a brain on stupid
Camouflage toughies'll touch your tufts roughly
Fluff your flat permanent, lump you up ruthless
Then laugh while you're humming the tune of bruised movements
That took a few too many tabs to prove lucid
(Everything compute?) Nah the truth is too tangled
And even a satellite sees at one angle
Burners radiate smoke 'til all's motionless
Hope? Nah, ha ha, slow down with the jokin' shit
So inappropriate, right behind your ears is a what?
Look: ta-dah! The sound of your hopelessness
I can feel it too, from the ground rising up in us
Right above the clouds there's a shroud there to smother us
Make a sane man walk around with a blunderbuss
Peel another round, make a sound that is thunderous

[Hook]

// Sea Legs //

[El-P:]
Really fell out the lane with this shit
Man, print this shit: I'm a misfit
Got a style from the guts of the most irrational beast in the district
Born to the next gen system
Slow water drip to the temple to live in a prison
When the walls don't appear to your vision
One floor down from that mall's that prison
Where shower stalls'll get all y'all missin'
Pardon me, I got half-wit vision
But fuck I know, I just crawled here, cap'n
Pass me the baton, the rest a ya'll batten the hatches
In fact, better scram, I'm a bastard
On the lam in a hatchback blasting some rap shit, trying not to slam into traffic
With my feet on the wheel and my hands through the moon roof laughing
Let's crash this
See the truth from the womb is a fool-proof plan to be doomed while the damned do they dances
So I move through the room like an animal fooling a master
But I don't got love for the hand with the food, matter fact I am drooling at that shit
I don't only bite but I'm rabid
Try to pet my fucking head again and I'mma put a tooth through the flesh of the palm that you jack with
This city just screams black magic, and the threat to my heart got traction
Maybe should've never started this path
Every time I get a chance to advance it's backwards
No thanks to my very own actions
Get a couple good drinks in the kid
I can flip on a friend, take a drug, fuck a chick that I shouldn't
Oh god, I am one of those mad men

[Hook:]
Trying not to walk crooked while this anchor's dropped
But I been out on them choppy waves and it's hard to say where this land begins and that water stops
I got sea legs [x3]

[Killer Mike:]
Real shit, I came for the jewels
I'm the killer of kings and fools
I'm the reason the season for treason starts this evening
And this evening the odds ain't even
People praying to the gods but the gods ain't even listening
Don't matter if you're Muslim, Hebrew, Christian
When death runs in the distance there will be no Mercy me's
There will be no reprieve for the thieves
There will be no respect for The Thrones
No master mastered these bones
Your idols all are my rivals
I rival all of your idols
I stand on towers like Eiffel, I rifle down all your idols
Niggas will perish in Paris, niggas is nothing but parrots
I write for the writers that write for the liars that impress you and your parents
Is this real or another dimension?
Am I trippin' here in the kitchen?
Am I a victim of my convictions?
I feel my sanity slippin'
And I think I like the freedom
Cannibal, animal, rappers I eat'em
Even in Dubai I smoke like it's legal
Bitch so exotic she rode on a zebra
Made in America home of the (eagle)
Home of the (anger), home of the (evil)
Do what I do for the good of my people
Holding my lane, smoke jane in a Regal

[Hook]

// Job Well Done //

[Killer Mike:]
Killer Mike and El-P
Fuck boys know the combination ain't healthy
Tell me if you smell the
Marijuana hanging off my breath
Blowing smoke and I'm coughing like I'm damn near death
If I died right now I would be so fresh to death
They would have to say "That fat motherfucker coffin fresh
God damn fat bastard, where that motherfucker's casket?"
But naw baby you gon' get this here vertical
Every word murderful
Surgical, painful, purposeful
And I'm taking left off your fuck list personal
Woo, they done let that fuckin' Mike out
It's like Tyson in the '80s, nigga snap and punch your lights out
It's like Tyson in the '90s, if I'm losing take a bite out
I'm so motherfuckin' grimy
So mutherfuckin' greedy, gritty
Mama said she couldn't breast feed cause I was bitin' at the titty
(Beast)

[Hook - Until The Ribbon Breaks:]
So I think we've burned our bridges, but it's difficult to tell
I've been walking through the ashes, saying "didn't we do well?"
So I think we'll have to pay for this, but I'm not afraid of hell
I've been walking through the ashes, saying "didn't we do well?"

[El-P:]
Killer Mike and El-P, fuck boys think about it
Fuck you gonna sell me, you don't know a thing about us
Women dosed with ayahuasca drum circle and sing about us
Dolphins prone to rape'll hear the tape and start to think about it
Monks won't immolate themselves until the record hits the shelves
Yetis walk right out the woods to cop it without thinkin' bout it
Workers at the sweatshop kill they boss to how the vets drop
Worker ants surround their queen and chew the bitch's head off
Drug dogs bark at the tour bus when it park
Priests take the cock out of their mouths to hum along when the chorus drop
At the least we are the most beef and broc on your fuckin' block
The bass make a whale off of the coast scream "Ya'll gotta stop!"
Used to be the new kid 'till I grew into that new shit
Emperors that hear the tunes admit that they are nudists
Move, we coming through 'em, we are ruthless
Mama said I wouldn't leave the womb without a Yankee and some new kicks

[Hook]

// No Come Down //

[El-P:]
You know I get loose, I'm a screw turned pro status
Never did shit but inflict this damage
Never met a word that I wouldn't like a weapon just brandish
Walk away clown boy, vanish
Feelin' outlandish, chemicals soaked in my cabbage
Face numb, face off rap shit, straight no chasing that dragon
Cess to the breast plate, raised where the stakes break badness
Get a tracheotomy tap for talkback shit
Slow clap, do the running man, back flip
Light a flare in the road, I'm an accident
Limping into the light I'm off axis
We got 808s to make cats piss, right on the rug where the cat sits
By the time this recording gets heard I'll be gone
With the dough from the jar plus mattress
Left a note on the fridge with a frowny face drawn
With a rope from its neck to the rafters
Not the most subtle way to explain
I'm a threat to the brain like a wool in the glass hit

[Hook - Killer Mike:]
I get so high, I close my eyes
Like I may die, and I won't come down

[Killer Mike:]
You know I get gone I'm a goner
In the VIP of the club where they strip with a zip and a boner
Girl named Mary looking like a black Madonna
Tell me I can rent her but I can never own her
She's naked as the day that her momma first born her
And later on in the song, yeah, I'mma bone her
But that ain't the purp, bro, please follow along, bro
God made a miracle it rained in the room
Blowing marijuana smoke in a smoke filled room
She leaned in my ear said "You ever did shrooms?"
I said "I never did that and I never did you
If it come in a pack baby I'mma do two."
Last act of the pact Mary Mack do it too
"If you agree to the terms we can do what it do"
She said "It is what it is." and we did what we did
Right before we popped 3 caps and 3 stems
She popped that molly, rocked my body, I fly high and my co-pilot
Psilocybin, got me slidin, slipping into another dimension
Me and this woman made love in Kemet
Traveled to the moon came back when we were finished
Fell to the earth, lost each other, died and we came back sister and brother
In that lifetime we couldn't have each other
So we killed ourselves and it killed our mother
True romance, in one lap dance
I was in my future, my present and past

[Hook]

// Get It //

[El-P:]
Penny ante your bets up
Any sanity left (nah)
Any chance for humanity's landing on who's the next up
Hope we handed 'em ammo enough to work from the neck up
Those who handling damage control don't wish us the best luck
I'm a living in smoke type
Floating with a grin over the moat type
Harry Allen on you bitch, I believe no hype
Closer to the edge than even we want to admit
If this don't go right
Then assholes like myself are proven so right
All I got is this rap shit
All I want is a castle
And to move like a man with a minimum of harassment
The company of women with opinions and fat asses
That's my list of demands
You don't answer them, get the Gatling

[Killer Mike:]
I'm stuck in a time capsule
When rap was actually factual
Meanest shit you spit might cause killers to come and clap at you
Stupid, goofy, stooly
The gooch in Gucci will slap you
And that go for the cop kissing cats that's in the back of you
They all sweet as Little Richard damn
Good God al-Molly
It make a nigga like me go "Woo!" and rob the party
I exit stepping with my weapon with the Jefferson walk
If you expressing any objections you can get left in chalk
So my suggestion's let a G be
Forgive my transgressions
Or I'mma be in Catholic confessions professing depression
I'm chin checking, chill stressing, on your button I'm pressing
Mike'll fuck a rapper's life up like Mo'Nique did to Precious

[Hook:]
You know I...
Get it

[El-P:]
My name is Jaime Meline
I'm not chasing the green, I'm taking it
Bosses don't change a thing in the name of seemingly making it
Servants'll kiss the ring of whoever they think is paying 'em
You don't deserve the spit that they hurdled up in your face and shit

[Killer Mike:]
My name is Michael Render
And we are the new Avengers
We're here to tell you all your false idols are just pretenders
They're corporation slaves indentured to all the lenders
So even if you got seven figures, you still a nigga

[El-P:]
Some men aren't meant for the light to be shined on their shitty talking
Ya'll better off trying to hide like the yay in a little pocket
We're overly fucking awesome
They watch and adopt our concepts
They squawk at the Run the Jewels squad
We skin 'em then cop a coffin

[Hook]

// Twin Hype Back //

[Prince Paul as Chest Rockwell:]
Now come over here and let me give you a tongue kiss on your hot pocket...

[El-P:]
Me and Mike'll go Twin Hype and do a dance on your windpipes
Put your fucking jazz hands back in your pants and get them shits sliced
Caught the ghost when I was yay high so today I stay way high
Do not worry about my habits, without sin I'd probably hate life

[Killer Mike:]
This is dope as that hard white you stuff in a crack pipe
A hit of this, a kid with Tourette's will chill out and act right
I'm fat but I dress nice and bitches finesse Mike
They suck the dick and squeeze on my belly like bagpipes

[El-P:]
I slap and I suck clits, I fuck in my church shoes
Humblest guy in the room and I am in the room too (get it?)
I'll bend you over on the roof while whistling Audio Two
They say that once a girl go Brooklyn no more soft dick'll do

[Killer Mike:]
I'm so Rakim and Eric B bitches check out my melody
I might Slick Rick on a fella (foul), catch me a felony
Hey, I might Shyne Po a ho, POW! Catch me a case
Producto must have rolled this L because this blunt feel laced

[Chest Rockwell:]
I must say you do look stunning
I mean, you're the kind of girl I can really see myself artificially inseminating
Oh I'm sorry, I'm being a little aggressive, right?
Can we start from the beginning? My name is Chest Rockwell, right?
And I love to make love to your booty...hole
Bad boy

[El-P:]
This is born alone die alone, so my dialogue's dastardly
Life's a tragedy generator operating at max capacity
This is porno for piraters, to the crooks it is relaxing
I am foreign to that soft talk, you can tell it from my accent

[Killer Mike:]
This is arrogant fat black, it is what it is
This that stingy with dick, bitch, not a fuck do I give
I'm no respecter of person, I'm no respecter of rules
I catch the prince of England slipping, he goin' run me the jewels
I could wake up brain dead tomorrow and my soliloquy still will be
The illest there'll ever be cause I be what you'll never be
My pugnacious rhyme patterns prove pitbull in my pedigree
And dogs fight to the death, you say you better, you better be

[El-P:]
Not one shit given, El-P's chillin'
Raised in a shack in the back of the village
Trained by the wolves in the woods
To avenge on the men who elected themselves my killers
Mike's a villain, Nick Hooks chillin'
We don't have a need to know your feelings
We don't believe in the same shit anyway, Run the Jewels is not for your children

[Chest Rockwell:]
How you feeling now sweetheart? A little more relaxed?
Maybe it's that half a molly I put in your Mountain Dew
Yeah, works like a charm. Just chill out for a second, relax, relax, I got it under control
I got you a glass of Beefeater, I got a brand new deck of Uno cards...
Oh yeah baby, the night's just getting started
Ok, how about I come over tonight and pick you up in my brand new Segway.
We can go over to Long John Silver's, get a fish platter
You can take me home and massage me with butter all on my neck
I love you

// A Christmas Fucking Miracle //

[El-P:]
That was me in BK on Atlantic
Never looked both ways, ran in traffic
Pops went away but I stayed, vagrant
Placed where the steel and cement became nature
Love what you did with the place, it looks gorgeous
Cityscape where the blood of good men courses
And the dreamers are bull trapped in porcelain
Take a knee to the gods and get horse shit
Wanna live for the thrill? They'll arrange it
Got a bevy of imps to spit hatred
Shit'll get in your head and cause panic
Have you desperately begging to get famous
Get your dignity dirty and left orphaned
Sanity on the fringe of distorted
Who are they to just take shit and hoard it?
Who am I that I don't get my portion?
The most impressionable minds get molested
And informed by manipulating forces
Don't fret little man, don't cry
They can never take the energy inside you were born with
Knowing that, understand you could never be poor
You already won the war, you were born rich
You can only take the energy you had
Going back to the realm or the home where your lord is
Whoever whatever that lord is couldn't
Give a fuck if you ever made fortunes
Fuck anyone ever trying to run that bum shit
Send 'em to the flames where the orcs live
Them and the lost minds thinking they're smarter than us
Don't understand love's importance
And we can weaponize that, bring 'em back to the truth
Where the ashes and dust got formed in

[Killer Mike:]
The beat breaks and your teeth break
Keep your canines embedded in my knuckles as a keepsake
It would seem your veneers just mere souvenirs
Falling out your mouth and on to the landscape
Me and El-P do the secret handshake
Then I pummel punch a pumpkin head punk in his pimple face
'Till he's punch drunk cause he's sweet as a pound cake
(Ain't he pussy, Mike?) Yeah, El, I'll say
Into the wild, wildstyle ghetto child running wild
Where the lions and the owls stay
The powers that be even offered up reprieves
Told us they ain't take us out if we bow to our knees
But they can give that to the kings and
Queens and the worshipers of idols and followers of things
Cause I would rather be in the jungle with the savages
It's kill or be killed and I'm working with the averages
My professor Emeritus say we been cursed being brought to the Americas
How you raise a whole human single parent, no marriages no sense of heritage
Planned Parenthood helping plan miscarriages
But I'm lucky mommy already had a narrative
Product of a teenage love,
My arrogance to rise from the pride
And the job my parents did
Named Mike I was told it was godlike
Even danced with the devil, came out alright
OK, honor y'all? No way
Still spell America with the triple K
Word up to Spice 1 and O'Shea
And any MC peepin' what I go through
Real rap, my last line's so true
Rest in peace to Pimp C and Camu too
We do it for you

// Pew Pew Pew //

[Killer Mike:]
I'm a rider and provider and I don't tolerate ho shit
I Bun B out on emcees meaning I obliterate yo' shit
Man, every time I try to like a rapper they turn and do ho shit
Make me ski mask on they a-a-ass, run they jewels and mo shit

[El-P:]
You looking at the guy who the guy that you think that I got my style from got his own style from ('sup?)
I came with a sly wink and a shit grin with a pimp limp and a foul tongue
I'm a Brooklyn son, set adrift in a chemtrail sky
Bad guys knock when the doors are locked, I got no shots left, better prep for God
Not long, He'll be talkin the same shit, I am just impossible
Got a right to be hostile, motherfucker life is a coffin, layin' down in it ainât awesome
Every single moment you spend in the dirt is a worse time than the last moment, own it
We all know you don't know shit (no shit!)
Me and Mike will straight write your obit

[Killer Mike:]
And the obit goes like this: "Here lies a punk bitch, real fuck boy type
Who never want shit, 'bout as soft as his momma's own tit"
And sensitive as his old lady's clit, real bust-out bitch
She fuck my clique, obscene, absurd with the words
I cleaned up curbs with the blood and the bones of you nerds
I kill with the mic and murder with words
I'm known on the corners where murders occur, I cruise in the verse where murderers lurk
When god in the building, who they gonna hurt

[El-P:]
Not a butterfly, bunny, bee, bird bein' hurt
Got a third-rock-from-the-sun claim for the turf
Never learned how to love, gimme brain then it burnt
Yeah that hurts, but at worst it will already start
With a curse in the heart that'll hurt til it's worse

[Killer Mike:]
Bttt Stick, Bttt Stick!
Let that four-fifth turn and twist em
If they all got the mark we miss em
I pray death come quick and kiss em
If he need help I assist him
Follow? All of my tips is hollow
I could kill your ass today but right now Iâm playin' Grand Theft Auto
Brain check
Iâm just come through your hood, and just shoot your ass tomorrow
Brain dead
Scattered over the hood of my old ladyâs brand new auto
Man, knew I should have kept it G and drove my Monte Carlo
It got like this, it shake in pieces, I shoot your ass again tomorrow
Bang!

[El-P:]
Ok, Iâm an asshole, kiss me (good luck!)
Break a leg in a bear trap, skippy
Wasnât in class when the lunch bell rang
Due to Colt 45 plus smoke got shitty
Mike already a help assist with me
Tag team of the goddamn century
I never asked for shit, it ainât in me
You go to work now, but the style haunts history
No doubt Iâm a dick, fuck with me
Liberty bell cracked, the cops arenât kidding
The rabbit in the hat is all deaf now, ain't it?
Came for the freedom, stayed for the prison
Came for the women, stayed for the money
Presidents are better worth dead to feed tummies
