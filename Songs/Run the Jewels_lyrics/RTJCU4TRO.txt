Esta semana Yankee y el valiente

Back at it like a crack addict, Mr. Black Magic, crack a bitch back
Chiropractic, Craftmatic big daddy smokin' big Cali
In the black alley, in a black Grand Natty
Rollin' down, ole natty hair
Nappy, matty as a black, grandaddy, all fact
No cappin', fat, black, bold cappin', stay floatin'
No flappin', where he runnin'? I'm a gunner
I'ma have your block hot as a sauna all summer
And I put that on Osama and my motherfuckin' momma
I'ma terrorize the actors playing like they want some drama
I'ma chop 'em with a chopper 'till I motherfuckin' drop 'em (Drop 'em, drop 'em, drop 'em, drop 'em)

Stack addict, I mack with the blackest fabric, I'm back
I'm magically rackin' it, that's what I'm thunkin', rat-a-tat-tats
I'm runnin' the trunk up for sucker shit
Matter of fact, kiss the ass and even the cra-a-ack
Automatic facts, it's like tha-a-at
Scandal bliss when you puttin' feelings in charge of shit
All of us targeted, all we doin' is arguin'
Part of them isn't workin' 'till every pockets been picked and sold and harvested
I'm ready to mob all these fuckin' Charlatans

Go-go-go-, go-go-go-go-
Go-go-go-go-, Go-go-go-go-
Go-go-go-go-, go-go-go-, go-go-
We up, now loot

Two time Don, I'm galactic and fly
The moon is movin', the maniac's in a shitty decline
Hearts fried, all this neon is grippin' in something's side
Immortality's out of bounds, this a one-round ride

I got one round left, a hunnid cops outside
I could shoot at them or put one between my eyes
Chose the latter, it don't matter, it ain't suicide
And if the news say it was that's a goddamn lie
I can't let the pigs kill me, I got too much pride
And I meant it when I said it, never take me alive

I got the Grand Nat runnin' in the alley outside
Yo Mike run like you hungry and get your ass in the ride
I'd rather have and not need you than watch your rotten demise
And you still owe for them Nikes, you do not get to just die
You try to fuck with my brother, you get the bastard surprise
And that's more honest than your whole life in a fraction of time
I didn't get my degree in how to smoke weed 'till I'm fly
So you could ruin my high, Jewel Runner, do and you're bye

My brother made a point so out the back door I'ma slide
I'm chubby, husky, die scrubbin', fuckin' up my Levi's
The crooked copper got the proper, I put lead in his eye
Plus we heard he murdered a black child so none of us cry

Yankee and the brave are here
Everybody hit the deck
We don't mean no harm
But we truly mean all the disrespect (watch them)

Go-go-go-, go-go-go-go-
Go-go-go-go-, Go-go-go-go-
Go-go-go-go-, go-go-go-, go-go-
We up, now loot

// ooh la la (Mexican Institute Of Sound remix) //

Uh, hey

Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Let's go)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Let's go)
Ooh, la la
(Â¿Tu tienes no somos muchos?)

Lookin' for M's like I lost a friend
Jump out of my bed like, "Where the bread?"
You gon' hold the egg, waiter bring the check
When we talk, we Kalashnikov, keep us in your thoughts
Fully dressed at the crack of dawn, weapons letting off
I can hear them from the block, see them creeping through the fog
Season's greetings, now feeding season can start, oh my God
Look alive, lookin' like I live life on a crooked line
Doin' fine, you want maximum stupid, I am the guy

First of all, fuck the fuckin' law, we is fuckin' raw
Steak tartare, oysters on the half-shell, sushi bar
Life a bitch and the pussy fish, still fucked her raw
I'm a dog, I'm a dirty dog, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ol' Dirty Bastard, go in your jaw, shimmy shimmy ya
Got the semi in the Hemi, goin' "Gimme, gimme, y'all"
Pugilistic, my linguistics are Jeru the Damaja
And I rap it pornographic, bitch, set up the camera

Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ah, oui oui)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Mon cheri, mon cheri)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Mon cheri, mon cheri)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (I need a bottle of MoÃ«t, ho, come on)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (GarÃ§on)

DueÃ±os de la zona (Hey yo)
No peleo la corona (No)
Soy quien la mueve (Â¡AjÃ¡!), soy el que la entona (Escucha)
Te tumbo a la lona, mi barrio no abandona
Reacciona, la vida sin respeto no funciona
MC's disparando rimas como un misil
Estamos en el bloque de party tirando skill
Weed pa' amanecer fumando y rapeando en el beat
Shit que te da the feel, prÃ©ndete el hachÃ­s

You covet disruption, I got you covered, I'm bussin' (Bussin')
My brother's a runner, he's crushin', it's no discussion ('Scussion)
I used to be munchkin, I wasn't 'posed to be nothin' (Nothin')
Y'all fuckers corrupted and up to somethin' disgusting
My pockets are plumper this season, I love to cuff 'em
I'm afraid of nothin' but nothingness, ain't it something?
Warmongers are dumpin', they'll point and click at your pumpkin (Look out)
Your suffering is scrumptious, they'll put your kids in the oven

Fuck a king or queen and all of they loyal subjects
I pull my penis out and I piss on they shoes in public
People, we the pirates, the pride of this great republic
No matter what you order, muhfucker, we what you're stuck with (Sorry)
I used to love Bruce, but livin' my vida loca
Helped me understand I'm probably more of a Joker
When we usher in chaos, just know that we did it smiling
Cannibals on this island, inmates run the asylum

Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Ayy)
Ooh, la la (DJ Premier)

Ooh, la la
Ooh, la-, la, la
Ooh, la la
Ooh, ooh, ooh, la la, ah, oui oui (Santa Fe Klan)
Ooh, la, la, la, la, la (Arriba Mexico)
Ah, oui, ah, oui, ah
Ah, ah, oui, oui(Musica del barrio)
Ooh, la, la, la, la, la
Ah, oui, ah, oui, ah
Ah, ah, oui, oui

// fuera de vista (TROOKO's Versión) //

Ayy
Ayy
(What you gonna do? What you gonna do?)

(R-R-Run-run) Here come the menaces to sobriety, like what? (What?)
Super thuggers thumpin' on the cut (Run-run)
(Run-run) My motherfuckin' Uzi weighs a ton
Hit the drum 'til you hear it go "brrum-pum-pum-pum"
(Run-run) Piety just really isn't us, what a rush
See you cuttin' up a pie, that's my lunch (Run-run)
Run your motherfuckin' pockets when I come
It's a honor to be robbed by Denise's only son
Yeah, ever ready baby boy of Bettie, movin' extra heavy
Whippin' Chevys, gotta get it, eat spaghetti with the mobsters
Vegan bitches, feed 'em dick 'cause they don't eat no steak and lobster
Sosa was my hero, homie, Tony's just a fuckin' hossa (Out of sight)
Out of mind, out of touch, out of time
Man, I'll smoke a bogie backwards with a thumb up like, "It's fine" (Run)
Save yourself, I say, selflessly divine
Leave me here to drown in glory, you're too good to cross that line (Run-run)
Tragically struck down in my prime
By the speed at which the bags are dropping, shoulda watched the sky
You don't wanna live this life, it's really not sublime
I'm only doing what I want while hockin' loogies at the swine

Out of sight (Ayy)
R-T-J, what you say? What you say? (Ayy)
I don't give a fuck, out-out-out-out of sight (Ayy)
R-T-J, what you say? What you say? (Ayy)
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?

We the motivating, devastating, captivating
Ghost and Rae relating product of the fuckin' '80s
Coke dealin' babies, never regulating, bag accumulating
It would not be overstating to say they are underrating
The pride of Brooklyn and the Grady, baby
We don't need no compliments or confidence
Our attitude and latitude is "fuck you, pay me"
Next summer, leather bombers, dookie ropes, and smokin' indica
Ain't a team as mean and clean as J Meline and Michael Render, bruh
TV got no temperature, even if it did
Bitch, we cool as penguin pussy on the polar cap peninsula
Colder than your baby mama heart (Uh)
When she find out you been fuckin' with that other broad and you ain't got that rent for her

I know you just about McFuckin' had it, our shit is just magic
Go figure the runts of the litter did it without scammin'
Was fryin' in the fat of the land, now your man is mashin'
We back of the class and laughin', you raisin' a hand and tattlin'
Mike shitted in your locker, then left a note with a winky face
Meet us at three o'clock if you wanna do something tragic
We'll shrinky-dinky all of that yappin', it's automated
The gears of the rapper shredder want action and it'll have it

Ah, eu atravesso cidades sem precisar de carona
Eu nasci pra usar Puma, 'cÃªs sÃ£o tudo cafona
Esses negos me imitam tipo clones da sombra
Devo ser terrorista porque todos sÃ£o bomba
Uma mamacita latina comigo na autoestrada
Parados na fronteira com droga importada
Ela cospe tanto que parece minha arma
Eu tentando dar fuga, ela baba e atrapalha
Foda-se, seu polÃ­cia, 'cÃª tÃ¡ meio equivocado
Eu nÃ£o sou mexicano, eu sou baiano, caralho
Um preto perigoso, gostoso e bronzeado
Kanye West da Bahia, corpo e carro blindado

Out-out-out of sight (Ayy)
R-T-J, what you say? What you say? (Ayy)
I don't give a fuck, out-out-out-out of sight (Ayy)
R-T-J, what you say? What you say? (Ayy)
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
(Ayy)
R-T-J, what you say? What you say? (Ayy)
Sight (Ayy)
(Ayy) Sight
(Ayy)
(Ayy)
What you gonnaâ gonnaâ gonnaâ What you gonna do?
Sight (Ayy)
(Ayy)
Sight (Ayy)
(Ayy) What you gonnaâ gonnaâ gonnaâ What you gonna do?

All them-a talk, them beat back them words
All them-a talk, them beat back them words
All them-a talk, them beat back them words
Allâ Allâ Aâ Allâ Allâ Aâ
All them-a talk, them beat back them words
All them-a talk, them beat back them words (Yo)
All them-a talk, them beat back them words (Yo)
Allâ Allâ Allâ Allâ

The law defier, the non-complier, the death defier
The Mike Myers, murder rapper for hire
Doer of drive-byers, the back-back, clack-clack
Let it loose, murder all witnesses and survivors
That's a job completer, dependable contractor
The backhand wack rap slapper
Mr. Leather Bomber Taker, catch ya getting off the escalator
Run the Jewels smooth and don't trigger the undertaker
Ayy, as a teen lackin', I woulda ran me a supreme racket
I woulda took these lames' Supreme jackets
Until you rob a hypebeast, you ain't seen sadness (Uh)
Clockwork Orange madness, left the scene laughin'

Ayy, we forever-ever, Jaimito y Michael de Render (Mhm)
The pyrotechnicrats, the ol' razzle dazzlers (Right)
The magic bean imbibers (Yes)
The green giant of the rhyme contrivers (Yes)
Supreme violence of the time describers (Yes)
I'm the decider, you evil eyers
A pile driver provider for liars, the sleep depriver
The nick of time, mercy kill denier in my prime
I'll kill the mood, I'm a rudeness MacGyver
I'll slap a yapper from the acne to the tooth bone fiber, I'm liver
Thought crime designer, criminal minder
And I'm a born and bred in USA who chop and screw truth up
Think I got a case of the Mondays, on (Â¡Fuego!)

Mad
Mad
Mad

Ayo, one for mayhem, two for mischief
Now aim for the drones in your zoning district (Woo)
Hindenburg 'em (Woo), get 'em, burn 'em (Woo)
Can't give the ghost up, no resistance
Pass that shit, Mike, I have to insist it
Reality sucks dick, how's that for wisdom? (Great)
Lick the toad's back like, "Mmm, delicious"
The time elves waved to me off in the distance (Hello?)
Hey lil' guy, I'm just walkin' through
From another timeline where monsters eat truth
Physicists say the dough I get's proof
The multiverse lives, I'm supposed to just lose
The glass bottom tank I drive is all fueled
Gotta try to stay cool, honey bunny, don't move
Fuck shit glows in the hearts of the brutes
You hate Run The Jewels, you don't love the troops
You miss the point tryna act like shit's cool
Don't fuckin' tell doom your number's not due (Ayy)
Every other goddamned year I'm brand new
It's been twenty plus years, you think that's a clue? (Huh?)
Maybe this guy kinda kill what he do
He's prolly that dude, he left enough proof
Plenty of these goofs disappeared, poof
He's still the next big thing, gotta hurt, oof (I got)

Â¡MÃ¡s fuego! (I got)
Â¡MÃ¡s fuego! (I got)
Â¡MÃ¡s fuego! (I got)
More fuego! (I got)

Ditch the payback, allow me to state that
All that forth-back, we don't play that
You want beef, bruh? You just state that
And we steak that, fry and bake that
One time in the big ol' south
Lived a lil' chubby kid with a big ol' mouth
Lame writers gave him big ol' doubts
Now the same lil' boy in a big ol' house
Look at him now, he in the big ol' cars
And the same folk hated pay big homage (Ayy)
One minute, let me be candid
Used to stand by the garbage can hand to handin'
That dumb trap shit, no proper plannin'
Seen ignorant shit like geekers dancin'
And rappers rap about it like it's so romantic
But I still can't seem to escape the panic
PTSD, streets did the damage
Kept me in hammock, laid back with cannons
Get me fucked up, it be's calamity
I'ma come through and leave some damages
Goddamn, somebody call amberlamp
Or ambulanceses, out of chanceses
Fuck that weak shit you be bantering
You're a common cold and my flows are cancerous (I got)

Â¡MÃ¡s fuego! (I got)
Â¡MÃ¡s fuego! (I got)
Â¡MÃ¡s fuego!
More fuego! (I got)

Take that, mugger, motherâ

// goonies contra E.T. (Danny Brasco & Nick Hook's Versión) //

Fuckers
Baby, si lo hiciera otra vez, cada vez serÃ­a siempre tÃº
Ooh
Mi deseo e' un deseo, y deseo que seas siempre tÃº
(Un, dos)

Egad, you heard of these lads, it's a myth
How we made a grip, never rode dick
Truly the Cadillac of how to contract L's on the quick
Stick 'em up, slick talker, no tricks
It's the funniest shit, finally the money up
And print on the kid and the planet hit skids
Livin' in a valley of flames like, "I win"
Skyline ablaze in a Bob Ross pic
You don't want to acknowledge I'm raw, give a shit?
Never, nah, you can talk of me fond when I'm gone
Bad news bear on the lawn with big claws
Tryna hold our whole lives in its paws and applaud
Swear to goddamn the whole city odd
Make a romance hard, we got scars for hearts
Shit for odds, baby, living in a one-chance LARP
So I stick to the art, oh my God, I'm
Ultra Mag, put cash in bag
Running through dead zone, hope I don't crash
Tenor Saw, motherfuck, ring it up fast
Be alarmed, I'ma harm what I can and then dash
Fuck y'all got, another planet on stash?
Far from the fact of the flames of our trash?
That is not snow, it is ash, and you gotta know
The past got a wrath, it's a lover gone mad
But I promise (Promise)

Baby, si lo hiciera otra vez, cada vez serÃ­a siempre tÃº
Ooh
Mi deseo e' un deseo, y deseo que seas siempre tÃº (TÃº, tÃº)
Ooh
La lÃ¡mpara mÃ¡gica estÃ¡ alejada, no hay luz (Luz, luz)
Tras deseo tras deseo tras deseo tras deseo
Pero es falso y sigo cargando cruz, ooh

Ey, mira
Ya ni tengo gas, anda escaso
Ah, lo que me retrasa ni caso
Mientras tÃº te atrasas yo avanzo
La vida continÃºa, tranqui, te doy paso
TÃº metido en brasa, yo en trazo
Mi casa en tu casa, si estÃ¡ pa' hacer caso
AquÃ­ no se descansa, no
Por si acaso, te dejo esta rimita pa' que te sirva 'e repaso
Rompo, yo nunca ronco, rimo
Me resino a hablar de lo que siento y lo que vivo
Pronto que se hace [?]
No se desempadre pero si de ser buen hijo, ah
Subiendo y bajando porque forma parte, mi [?] que crecÃ­, 'cÃ­
Ya no tengo miedo a lo que venga, que venga la bestia to'a esa gente que habla romÃ¡ntico

Amazing, ain't it, how we made it and didn't fake it?
Life's a disguise, the truth is butt naked
Used to be a time I'd see it and not say it
Now I understand that woke folk be playin'
Ain't no revolution is televised and digitized
You've been hypnotized and Twitter-ized by silly guys
Cues to the evenin' news, make sure you ill-advised
Got you celebratin' the generators of genocide
Any good deed is pummeled, punished, and penalized
Rulers of the world will slice it up like a dinner pie
Race in a nation told you to identify
People take false pride and warfare incentivized
Fuck that, me and my tribe, we on an iller vibe
We accept the role of the villains 'cause we been villainized
Stomped to the dirt of the Earth, we still will arise
In the Terrordome, let me alone as I soliloquize
This is license to ill with a license to kill
This is nigga with an attitude in Beverly Hills
Heavy build with a pocket full of treasury bills
Got a fire high temper, find it hard to chill
I'm a lifetime member, fuck that fuck shit
Me and Jaime versus y'all with a knife and a musket
May our tombstones read, "They were nothing to fuck with"
Please say that shit again, Mike
"Wasn't nothing to fuck with" (What?)

// caminando en la nieve (Orestes Gomez & Nick Hook's Versión) //

Get a dose, a dirty code to go, been cold since Co-Flow
Got a wire or two unlodgin', I'll set a fire down below
I'll hang it up when you say, "Sorry, I didn't know"
Prolly got a year or ten to go, so let's go
I don't really know how to go slow
Deje de caminar en la nieve
Goddamn, that motherfucker's cold (Ayy)
You in the wrong mode, you open and closin' your hole, it's a no go
This whole world's a shit moat, filled to the brim like Gitmo
When you think it don't get mo' low it limbo 'til the sticks on flo'
All oppression's born of lies, I don't make the rules, I'm just one guy
All due respect, if getting spit on's how respect is now defined
Hungry for truth but you got screwed and drank the Kool-Aid, there's a line
It end directly at the edge of a mass grave, that's their design
Funny fact about a cage, they're never built for just one group
So when that cage is done with them and you still poor, it come for you
The newest lowest on the totem, well golly gee, you have been used
You helped to fuel the death machine that down the line will kill you too (Oops)
Pseudo-Christians, y'all indifferent, kids in prisons ain't a sin? Shit
If even one scrap of what Jesus taught connected, you'd feel different
What a disingenuous way to piss away existence, I don't get it
I'd say you lost your goddamn minds if y'all possessed one to begin with

Lo que sea for my team to play
Soy como Curry voy de mi streak
Voy abajo por un par de puntos pero siempre hago el triple faltando seis
Esas Gucci que tienes son fake
Eso que fuman no es purple haze
Eso que beben no es lean, no
Eso es jarabe para no toser
Todas esas perras dicen que me aman pero igual maÃ±ana puede serme infiel
Ese negro dice ser mi amigo pero solo quiere comer mi pastel
No confio en ningun maldecido que no haya comido sobre mi mantel
Fuckin' mundo cruel
Discrimina mi color de piel
Tengo el cora' frio como el Ãrtico
Ahora dicen que soy antipatico
Muchos falsos salieron del atico
Y decian que eran mis fanaticos, son de plastico
Cuando arranco, ya no hay quien me pare
Valentino Rossi, me dicen The Doc
Tengo flow [?] parezco de [?]
A mi no me ganan niguno 'e estos tontos
No

Yo
Deje de caminar en la nieve, el pinche frio sÃ­ que se siente
Deje de caminar en la nieve, el pinche frio sÃ­ que se siente
Deje de caminar en la nieve, el pinche frio sÃ­ que se siente
Deje de caminar en la nieve, el pinche frio sÃ­ que se siente

Pawmps, shoutout to OG Run the Jewels
Estamos afuera y hace un chingo de frÃ­o, goddamn it

The way I see it, you're probably freest from the ages one to four
Around the age of five you're shipped away for your body to be stored
They promise education, but really they give you tests and scores
And they predictin' prison population by who scoring the lowest
And usually the lowest scores the poorest and they look like me
And every day on the evening news, they feed you fear for free
And you so numb, you watch the cops choke out a man like me
Until my voice goes from a shriek to whisper, "I can't breathe"
And you sit there in the house on couch and watch it on TV
The most you give's a Twitter rant and call it a tragedy
But truly the travesty, you've been robbed of your empathy
Replaced it with apathy, I wish I could magically
Fast forward the future so then you can face it
And see how fucked up it'll be
I promise I'm honest
They coming for you the day after they comin' for me
I'm readin' Chomsky, I read Bukowski, I'm layin' low for a week
I said somethin' on behalf of my people and I popped up in Wikileaks
Thank God that I'm covered, the devil come smothered
And you know the evil don't sleep
Dick Gregory told me a couple of secrets before he laid down in his grave
All of us serve the same masters, all of us nothin' but slaves
Never forget in the story of Jesus, the hero was killed by the state

Deje de caminar en la nieve, el pinche frio sÃ­ que se siente
Deje de caminar en la nieve, el pinche frio sÃ­ que se siente
Deje de caminar en la nieve, el pinche frio sÃ­ que se siente
Deje de caminar en la nieve, el pinche frio sÃ­ que se siente

Contraattack como los Black
Arremetiendo duro con el track
Levantando la voz por los caÃ­dos que murieron a causa de la gunshot
Ready to die
Voy defendiendo a los mios con mÃºsica y buenos mensajes
Pa' que respeten este mestizaje
Pa' que se lo vivan mi latinaje
To es lo que traje, tema central
Contra la segregacion racial
Contra la desigualdad social
Tambien la brutalidad policial
En nuestro pensar, es nuestro ideal
Nos quieren callar por manifestar
Ese descontento por todo el gran sufrimiento que nos han querido causar
But I have a dream
Like a master, Luther King
Y eso es convivir en santa paz con lo demÃ¡s es nuestro fin
No hay mas na'
Con mas equidad
Hasta que halla igualdad
Y oportunidad pa' la humanidad
Que habite en nuestra sociedad

Earth folk, not a mellow bunch
We got our thumbs in the air like hell or bust (Uh)
Look at who we done blessed with our trust
I don't think we'll be left with too much
Hand on my heart and my mind on my drugs
Got a Vonnegut punch for your Atlas shrugs
They love to not love it's just that dumb
Lord, sweet Buddha please make me numb
Brain bounce off walls like a sentient Roomba
Just found out his creator's stupid
Lit by the supermoon, I'm too lucid
Plus got shrooms in the blood, I'm zoomin'
Beep beep, Richie, this is New York City
The X on the map where the pain keep hitting
Just us ducks here sitting
Where murderous chokehold cops still earnin' a livin'
Funny how some say money don't matter
That's rich now, isn't it, get it? Comedy
Try to sell a pack a smokes to get food
Get killed and it's not an anomaly

2020, run the map
Raw, uncut, yeah my hourglass

You see the piece, now run it fast
On the tarmac, in a starter jack
C4 when I run it back
Like a track star, run a record lap?
Nah, like when his needle catch (Yeah)
Clean look, poet pugilist
A shooters view, a Zapruder flick (Yeah)
Too rude for ya rudiments
Who convinced you you could move against the crew?
In this, comin' up through the fence
Off shore outta Port-au-Prince (Yeah)
Overture left his fingerprints
On our hearts at the gate and the world our residence
How can we be the peace?
When the beast gonna reach for the worst (Yeah)
Tear all the flesh off the Earth
Stage set for a deafening reckoning
Quick like the pace of a verse
So I'm questioning this quest for things
As a recipe for early death threatening (Yeah)
But the breath in me is weaponry
For you, it's just money

// nunca mirar hacia atrás (Bomba Estéreo's Versión) //

Eighty-one miles to the hour down road (Uh, uh, uh)
Never looked back, never ever went slow
Never look back, heard 'em say that before
Never look back, never stare at a ghost
BK air in the summertime choke (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Ain't shit fly but the drones, oh no (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Low on the smokes, grab another pack, go
Pops smoked too when playing piano
Pops, I'm you, it's funny how that go
Mom, you too, I never could drink slow
Never look back, heard her say that before
Sound like the type of advice I'd ignore
Funny how time feel off tick tock
You thinking death's beat, it drop a clock shot
Never smoke sad, I heard that's a thought
Got forty-four bucks on the smoke, whatchu got?

Never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back

Got my mind on a mission on the road to perdition
The crime and the grind, I'll admit it, I'm wit' it
Must've suckle up crime from my mama right titty
'Cause if dollar made cents, no question she was with it
She was queenpen-ing, independent when I was a kiddy
Uncle Luke, "Don't stop, get it, get it," Magic City
Mommy told me never give a nigga my plug
Then she told me never give these bitches my love
Still 'til this day, bruh, I'm missing my girl
Still 'til this day, I'm perfectin' my thug
Daddy told me never give a honey my money
Had to ask Daddy, "Did that include Mommy?"
Made dollar, made cents, made money, money, money
Got a wife built like a Playboy bunny
Fucked up, but I kept her 'cause I keep it one hunnid
Made a mil, that's for real, ain't a damn thing funny

Ne-never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back

So, asÃ­ estÃ¡ la cosa
No puedes ir adelante, y no puedes volver atrÃ¡s
El pasado, el presente, el futuro, son irrelevantes
Lo Ãºnico que importa es la gratitud
La gratitud lo es todo, el tiempo, el tiempo no es nada

'81 when I moved to the county where the kings is
Walk past St. James place where the king lived
Think quick, never saw class, a delinquent
Now I get cash for the beats and the sync chips
Smart-ass kid with a mean lip
Mom said, "J, gonna speak? Better mean it" (Deepness)
Now I'm on fleek as a preset
I don't wear a leash in the least but I'm beasting

Never look back, you will only get bitter
If you get bitter, you will never get better
Never get better, then you never get bigger
Never get bigger, then you never make cheddar
Tell the truth, fella, you were never really special
You were just a lame nigga with a hit record
Your time came and it changed like the weather
Run The Jewels, muthafucka, we still forever

Ne-never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back
Never look back

// el suelo debajo (Son Rompe Pera's Versión) //

The God killer, this Tokyo and I'm Godzilla
Playing blackjack versus death, gun on the card dealer
Just bought a Demon, I'm screamin' up out the car dealer
The last temptation of Mike, but I'm a god figure
Tell Beelzebub that the God don't need a job
And if I did, the oligarchs would be missing, murdered and robbed
This is Bonaparte and he paired with Toussaint
And they went on a world conquest, tearing your bone apart
Michael remained murderous, but still virtuous
Wait to kill the petty and foul at the church services
Not a holy man, but I'm moral in my perverseness
So I support the sex workers unionizing their services

You say that you don't love me (Ayy)
I'm guessing I'ma be okay
You say that you don't feel me now
I feel like I'ma live somehow
Quiero cumbia mÃ¡s en mÃ­
Quiero cumbia mÃ¡s en mÃ­
Quiero cumbia mÃ¡s en mÃ­
Quiero cumbia mÃ¡sâ

Born from the ether, I just appeared out a cloud of reefer
Screamin' "Fuck the world," it can drink what's coming out my urethra
I'll slap a dying child, he don't pronounce my name correct
Rules have gotta be rules, any exceptions and I'm not a leader
Think in the box, I'm not getting my fix, then shit is iffy
Felate a donut hole wife don't get to the crib and quickly
I'll watch my mouth when I'm finished watching y'all suck clout
Don't doubt you put an ounce of that evil on me, I'm flippin', Ricky
I give a inch to you simps, I'll never forgive me
Not saying it's a conspiracy, but you're all against me
You see a future where Run the Jewels ain't the shit
Cancel my Hitler-killing trip
Turn the time machine back around a century

You say that you don't love me (Ayy)
I'm guessing I'ma be okay
You say that you don't feel me now
I feel like I'ma live somehow
Quiero cumbia mÃ¡s en mÃ­
Quiero cumbia mÃ¡s en mÃ­
Quiero cumbia mÃ¡s en mÃ­
Quiero cumbia mÃ¡sâ

Naucalpan
En el clÃ¡sico, en Brooklyn, chipurasu
Every child, woman and man
Opinion don't matter, stick to your plan (Chipurasu)
If they judge, still don't budge
Don't give a inch, don't give a nudge (Nudge)
Life a bitch, leave you battered and bent
Lose or win, gotta hold up your chin (Chin)
And I put it on Jaime and me
We just gave you inspiration for free
The money never meant much
InÃ©s

// tirando el detonador (Mas Aya & Nick Hook's Versión) //

[Lido Pimienta:]
Oh-oh-oh

[El-P:]
From a long line of the rancidest swine came the violators
The cloven foot designers of high crime for the iron ages
Twisting down through time, see them tryna unwind creation
Don't be surprised, it's a mistake to think their influence had faded
"Well, what a wretched state of danger we've made here," I thought to me
Perhaps explaining years of self lobotomy, toxicly
Perhaps explaining tears and even tears in my cosmology
You numb yourself for years and it can wear upon you, honestly
These old foxes got a lotta plots to outfox us (Ayy)
Tryna divvy up and dump in corresponding boxes, how obnoxious
Where the heart and mind connect, expect them targeting like archers
You will not travel towards the light if they're in charge of your departure
You'd think the universe forgot us the way the cursed pitch their product (Woo)
As though our spirit's not a fire that can't be snuffed or turned to dollars
Or the expanse across all space can't be contained in one small dollop
Now I see that it's the same moment in history back to haunt us
And here we are again
Hello void, long time watcher, first time callin' in
Every cage built needs an occupant
Got a dead bolt, see 'em lock it in
Had a good run, but they stoppin' it
Wanna walk, man, to the coffin lid
Eat your heart out, fiction fan
Truly the truth's the stranger document

[Lidio Pimienta:]
Mira, mÃ­rate
Y ahora mÃ­rame a mÃ­, oh
Me rÃ­o de tÃ­, oh no
Hay un dolor, hay un dolor que duele solo en las entraÃ±as del pelo que tus alas mojÃ³
MÃ­ralo tÃº, mÃ­ralo tÃº
Quiero que se hacÃ­a, quiero que si no, creo si no, no, no, no, no, no
Ayy, no lo creo jamÃ¡s que duele tanto
Esa granada del mal
Y una Daga del mal

[Killer Mike:]
At best, life is difficult, poor and you pitiful
Then every day's like a satanic ritual
Beautiful soul with a rogue and the criminal
How long must the holy hold onto they principles?
Kickin' and screamin' while watchin' the demons
Collecting the gold and the diamond residuals
My pastor say, "God has promised us paradise
Live a good life, it is pivotal"
I promised my mama that I would stay honest
But I want it all in the physical
And promise I'm honest, I'll probably be punished
'Cause keeping that promise too difficult
So picture me red as I sit on the bed
With my hands on my head and this pistol too
Why the fuck must I be miserable?
The devils, they do the despicable
And still, they move like they invincible
These filthy criminals sit at the pinnacle
Doin' the typical, keepin' us miserable
Takin' the most and providin' the minimal
Hate to sound cynical, but shit is pitiful, times is just critical
Like Jimmy Savile, they cheerfully kill kids in a ritual
I'll murder the miserables, I'll make it all biblical
I'll cut off their heads, they'll beg for their life and I'll put it up digital
Fuck the political, the mission is spiritual
A murderous miracle that was sent here to just punish the terrible

[Lido Pimienta:]
Oh, no me arrepiento
Aunque lo siento que te doliÃ³
Cuando te tire esa granada y te metÃ­ la Daga
Bien dentro de la sangre por hijo'e'puta
Por engaÃ±arme ma', que no

// unas palabras para el pelotón de fusilamiento (radiación) (Adrian Terrazas-Gonzalez & El Producto's Versión) //

[El-P:]
I woke up early once again, that's four days straight
I didn't wake you, baby, I just watched you lay
In the radiation of the city sun
I am in love with you, it is my only grace (Woo)
You know how everything can seem a little out of place?
All of my life, that seemed to be the only normal state
So feelin' normal never really meant me feelin' sane
And bein' clear about the truth and bein' sane have never really been the same
I used to wanna get the chance to show the world I'm smart (Ha)
Isn't that dumb? I should've focused mostly on the heart
'Cause I seen smarter people trample life like it's an art
So bein' smart ain't what it used to be, that's fuckin' dark
You ever notice that the worst of us have all the chips?
It really kinda takes the sheen off people gettin' rich
Like maybe rich is not the holy, ever-lovin'
King of nothin' fuckers, know we know you're bluffin'
You are dealing with the motherfuckin' money-money runners

[Killer Mike:]
It'd be a lie if I told you that I ever disdained the fortune and fame
But the presence of the pleasure never abstained me from any of the pain
When my mother transitioned to another plane, I was sitting on a plane
Tellin' her to hold on, and she tried hard, but she just couldn't hang
Been two years, truth is I'll probably never be the same
Dead serious, it's a chore not to let myself go insane
It's crippling, make you wanna lean on a cup of promethazine
But my queen say she need a king, not another junkie, flunky rapper fiend
Friends tell her, "He could be another Malcolm, he could be another Martin"
She told her partner, "I need a husband more than the world need another martyr"
Made in Atlanta, Georgia, where I use to ride the MARTA
With a empty .22 in the front pocket of my Braves Starter
Tryin' to make it out the mud as a baby father is much harder
The same children that you love and adore, the court'll use to break and rob ya
Circumstance woulda broke a weaker man, but I put it on my mama
I'm a man of honor and the hardship made me a better money runner

[El-P:]
This is for the never heard, never even got a motherfuckin' word
This is for my sister, Sarah, honey, I'm so sorry you were hurt (Ayy)
This is for the dawn, mama took a knock, had to change the locks
Dusted up and brushed off and I watched, talk about a boss
For the holders of a shred of heart even when you wanna fall apart
When you're surrounded by the fog, treadin' water in the ice cold dark
When they got you feelin' like a fox runnin' from another pack of dogs
Put the pistol and the fist up in the air, we are there, swear to God

[Killer Mike:]
Black child in America, the fact that I made it's magic
Black and beautiful, the world broke my mama heart, and she died an addict
God blessed me to redeem her in my thoughts, words, and my actions
Satisfaction for the devil, goddammit, he'll never, ever have it
This is for the do-gooders that the no-gooders used and then abused
For the truth tellers tied to the whippin' post, left beaten, battered, bruised
For the ones whose body hung from a tree like a piece of strange fruit
Go hard, last words to the firing squad was, "Fuck you too"

[Lin-Manuel Miranda:]
Esta es la historia de una pareja de piyos baratos
Acusados por policÃ­as piyos que se ven obligados a huir, para que no los maten
Solo tienen una bolsa de billetes, un Buick Grand National robado
Y su reputaciÃ³n de malos
No son amigos exactamente
Estos tipos mejor se matan que resolver
No seÃ±or, son hermanos, y aunque las cosas pinten color de hormiga brava
Realmente no creo, que quiera apostar contra ellos
Yankee y el Valiente
El Yankee y el Valiente siempre tirando pal frente
El Yankee y el Valiente siempre cuidando a su gente
El Yankee, el Valiente, somos dos jefes, cuidan su gente, siempre pal frente, los dos dementes, andan sonrientes
Una historia Ãºnica
El Yankee y el Valiente nunca los verÃ¡n ausentes
El Yankee y el Valiente con la fe siempre pal frente
El Yankee y el Valiente una historia diferente
