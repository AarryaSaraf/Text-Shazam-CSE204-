Album: ThatWhatIsNot

// Acid Drops //

What does it mean, what does anything mean
Sending out signals I see the smoke screens
What is not dirty, what is not clean
What should we not hear, what shouldn't be seen
Running off verbals like a runaway truck

Who censors the censor, can I do that myself
Make up my own mind like anyone else
Forget me, forget me not
Remember me like acid drops

Mind over morals, anything banned
The zealots are marching with Bible in hand
Keyed to the roof 100 proof
Some of them hairpins, some of them clams
Desperate Susans, desperate Dans

Who censors the censor, can I do that myself
Make up my own mind like anyone else
You read but missed my plot
You only see that what is not

These are clueless, living in fear
Scared of their own sex or anything clear
Still looking down proboscis crown
Vague hope and no charity - welcome to the 21st century

The hush puppy hushes, a dummy dumb struck
What is bad language, what shouldn't be heard
Or used as a token or used as a word
What is not dirty, what is not clean
What is not filthy, what is obscene

Who censors the censor, can I do that myself
Make up my own mind like anyone else
Forget me, forget me not
Remember me like acid drops

These different colours, different style
Different cultures - these blend in a while
Prejudice prods through a big picket fence
Divided we fall without a defense

The seat of easement, the privy parliament
Petticoat merchants bent on intent
There everywhere, these tricks of the trade
Some in the light, some in the shade

// Luck's Up //

When the blood in your drugs turns to shale
They had you hung, drawn and quartered tooth and nail
Empty pockets making idle hands
Mugging as a job requires good plans

Luck's up, tuff stuff
Luck's up, tuff luck
Luck's up, tuff stuff
Unlucky you

And where were you when the pickings were thicker than slime
A serious problem needs to be on time
Not good enough to crawl in the dark
You idiot, getting ripped off in the park

Luck's up, tuff stuff
Luck's up, tuff luck
Luck's up, tuff stuff
Unlucky you
Unlucky you

When the drugs that you were mixing blew up in your face
Blew your brains out, put a hole in its place
You wear your luck now all over your face
Still singeing like an old fire place

Luck's up, tuff stuff
Your luck's up, tuff luck

So yet again I hear you're gonna clean up your act
But once a junkie, always and that's a fact
You've begged, stole and borrowed time far too long
See you at your funeral, I'll sing your swan song

Luck's up, tuff stuff
Luck's up, tuff luck
Your luck's up, tuff stuff
Unlucky you
Well boo hoo

Un-fucking lucky you
Boo hoo
Got rid of the stupid rubbish
Un-fucking lucky you
Lucks up

// Cruel //

Body and soul, an animal
As a sword, swing double edged
Dig deep down, that monthly frown
You have the tools, to make men fools

Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
(It's so cruel)
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel

Cleopatra, the rat catcher
Preambling eyeball shopping
Measuring, your next victim
Too good to be sin, far too entertaining

Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
(You're so cruel)
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
(So cruel)
Cruel, cruel, cruel

She said, "The most evil thing I can do
Is to give my body to you"

Silhouette, the suffragette
Behind the scenes the deadly schemes
Your best nightmare, without a prayer
From ship to shore paramour amour

Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
(So cruel)
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel

Inside our head, twenty two to lead
The modern miss, with modern gifts
In the tragedy hilarity
Never sin, far too entertaining

Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel
Cruel, cruel, cruel

// God //

I can only feel and think in the language of
Cliches others have concocted for you
Prefabricated pre-conception
Worn like the walls around you
All around you

How good to walk - with the caprice of God
How good to talk - with the caprice of God
Build your ivory tower
So you can scratch the sky

How could I forget that, you're not finished yet and that
All that you have done, still adding up the sum
This totem has some use, the total of abuse
Real life is never used as truth

Angry artillery on your tongue
Bows and arrows highly strung
Same shadow I can see right through
Whenever I picture you

How good to walk - with the caprice of God
How good to talk - with the caprice of God
An ordinary human - an ordinary mortal, and ordinary model
Build your ivory tower - so you can touch the sky

Don't hide inside the sentiment
The real test is never finished yet
Face up, collect the interest
Of all the idiots you should detest

How good to walk - with the caprice of God
How good to talk - with the caprice of God
An ordinary human - an ordinary mortal
An ordinary model

// Covered //

I give, I give, I give...

Some unions are based on trust, some unions are a must
Trussed up like a turkey, upside down on a turn key
You and me
Some like it on the other side
Others like to play both sides

I give I give
I give I give I give I give, big girls
I give I give
I give I give I give I give, big joys
I give I give
I give I give I give I give, big toys
I give I give
I give I give I give I give, I give I give

I give, I give, I give...

I'll give you gristle, you blow the whistle
Waiter service, wait for this miss
And don't you diss this, this is bliss miss
Around the world with this miss
Disgusting lewd rudeness
Secretly seductive, spontaneous combustive
Happiness a penis, I give I give I give, I g-g-g-g-give

I give, give, give, give, give, give
I give I give
I give I give I give I give, big girls
I give I give
I give I give I give I give, big joys
I give I give
I give I give I give I give, big toys
I give I give
I give I give I give I give, I give I give

I give, I give, I give...

You can wear high heals in unusual places
And different situations can fit into new faces
Somebody's like to roll in a sleaze
Never mind me, just do as you please
All these implications
All these connotations
The pleasure in the leisure
Without the complications

I give I give
I give I give I give I give, big girls
I give I give
I give I give I give I give, I give I give
I give I give
I give I give I give I give, big joys
I give I give
I give I give I give I give, I give I give
I give I give I give I give...
Big joys, big joys, big girls, big joys, big toys, big girls, big joys...

// Love Hope //

I can see potential
I can see intention
With a pocket full of seeds
Hope keeps me alive
I can see contention
Financing situations
And maybe may never be

Drawing you in, drawing you on
Leading you in, taking you on

Love bites trivia severely
It has to be treated with respect
And taken seriously, seriously, lonely
I want to belong

Drawing you in, drawing you on
Leading you in, taking you on

I want to belong...

Nothing comes from nothing
No wisdom than the silence
Negotiable affections
Even lovers need lessons

Drawing you in, drawing you on
Leading you in, taking you on
Drawing you in, drawing you on
Leading you in, taking you on

I want to belong...

// Unfairground //

Where can I stand in my uniform
Cannon fodder - six foot tall
Big and brave, next to my grave
Wait patiently for the death of me

Swings and roundabouts on unfairground
Ground in the ground on the merry-go-round

Blood and toil swim well in oil
And you and me the perfect foil
Unfield units to invest
Patriots do not protest

Swings and roundabouts on unfairground
Ground in the ground on the merry-go-round
Swings and roundabouts on unfairground
Ground in the ground on the merry-go-round

Weight of the world on your shoulders
A brass monkey on your back
As beautiful gardenia boulders or
Dead meat hung on a rock

Bigger the man, bigger the desk
Questioning your IQ test
Are you now so easily led
And lose the brains inside your head

Swings and roundabouts on unfairground
Ground in the ground on the merry-go-round
Swings and roundabouts on unfairground
Ground in the ground on the merry-go-round

The weight of the world on your shoulders...
Boulders on your boack - wait patiently
For the death of me

// Think Tank //

Could have been a major problem
But I did not - I didn't look back
And all you dirty druggies
Chicken shit - sad sacks
Rewriting history
Tampering in my story
Standing in my shadow
But still so pale, so shallow

Think tank, winner takes all, loser takes blank
Think tank, burning off steam, loser takes blank

Mother nature's kind regards
Balancing the house of cards
Assuming and consuming
Of the peg commodities
The politics of common sense
Violence as self defense
Smiles and metaphors
The languages of lesser whores

Think tank, winner takes all, loser takes blank
Think tank, burning off steam, I'll let you dream

Dream on
I might no know much - but I know all this
Did you think I would not notice
Dream on

Love loves money and delights in praise
Easy money as a virtue, just watch it quickly fade
And it could have been a problem
But I did not - I don't look back

Think tank, winner takes all, loser takes blank
Think tank, burning off steam, loser takes blank
Think tank, winner takes all, loser takes blank
Think tank, burning off steam, I'll let you dream
Dream on

// Emperor //

Is there a king that can do no wrong
The crown that sings its very own song
You crack the whip and I'll break the lance
When I play my fiddle - will I see you dance

You make me feel like an emperor
You make me feel so proud and sure
So secure from the familiar
Uncommon sense is the great leveller

Best to flatter the devil than fight him
The weak heart hidden-in weaker sin
An occupation is as good as land
In you I have a kingdom in the palm of my hand

You make me feel like an emperor
You make me feel so proud and sure
So secure from the familiar
Uncommon sense is the great leveller

An emperor - we need you
An emperor - we need you

Even a speckle of sand
Can be dangerous in the right hand

Emperor - we need you

Don't want to be no inflexible flake
If I'm standing too brittle - I know that I'll break
And all the doors - I broke into
And all these doors - I opened for you
I've seen too many crack at the seams
I need the wonder of all my wet dreams
The chance to put heaven back on earth
And lift the hammer - lift the curse

You make me feel like an emperor
You make me feel so proud and sure
So secure from the familiar
Uncommon sense is the great leveller

You make me feel like an emperor
You make me feel so proud and sure
So secure from the familiar
Uncommon sense is the great leveller

Emperor...

You see little fears keep us in chains
And throw away thoughts, flushed down the drains
Sweet poetry

Emperor...

// Good Things //

Little white lies - they hold little surprise

Good things come in threes
The places I haunt - the powers I taunt
And the little I need, I need

Where the arrogance of presidents - drive with the top down
And pop singers bite bullets and pops kiss the ground
The most favoured nations should be atheists
Not the penny pinch manipulators of the fundamentalists

Good things come in threes
The places I haunt - the powers I taunt
And the little I need

For everyone spotted - ten get missed
The deeper you look - the longer the list
And the CNN calling card - red herring day, "No news today"
Somebody somewhere indirectly directs them on their way
Stand up a token figure and twist whatever they say

Good things come in threes
The places I haunt - the powers I taunt
And the little I need
Good things come in threes
The places I haunt - the powers I taunt
And the little I need

Little white lies - they hold little surprise

Pin it on no one - it doesn't matter anyway
How many political despots worked for the USA
And who controls down South America way
And who controls the modern Russian way
Death in the streets, death is a project
All in the weak, the poor, the rich, the racist
And free thought should be looked upon as an enemy
Because free thought went to jail, long ago, what a pity

The spider's kiss, the White House astrologists
How many political despots worked for the CIA
The spider's kiss, the White House astrologists
Fuck, it's the CIA

Good things come in threes
The places I haunt - the powers I taunt
And the little I need
Good things come in threes
The places I haunt - the powers I taunt
And the little I need
...
