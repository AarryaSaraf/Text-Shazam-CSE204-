// Mad Max //

This is what you want
This is what you get

Bad life

Call me up after midnight
Tell me I'm wrong
Tell me I'm right
What do you want
What do I get
Did you just need the argument

Bad life

See this face
Better remember it
See this face
Gonna take all of it

Corporate city
Lucky for some
Richest island in the sun

Bad life
Bad bad bad life

Well this machine is on the move
Now looking out for number one (ha ha)
Bad life

Name of the game is competition
Top of the pile on demolition
This is what you want
This is what you get

Bad, bad, bad life
Bad life
Now looking out for number one
Now this machine is on the move

Bad life

Call me up after midnight
Tell me I'm wrong
Tell me I'm right
What do you want
What do I get
Did you just need the argument

Bad life
Corporate city
Lucky for some
Richest island in the sun
Bad life
Bad, bad, bad life

Well this machine is on the move
Now looking out for number one
Bad life

// Bad Night //

I think it's just been another bad night
I think it's just been another bad night
I think it's just been another bad night
I think it's just been another bad night

I'm not an actor
I cannot hide away
Whatever I want to say
I let it out
Maybe I'm wrong
The games you play
Go on too long

I think it's just been another bad night
I think it's just been another bad night

I put my foot in it
I said the wrong thing
I opened my mouth
I let the rubbish flow out

I wish that sometimes
I wouldn't talk so blind
And I always guess
The hard rules of life

// Lou Reed Part 2 //

Hello...

Where are you?...

So now you keep your distance
Double on the nuisance
Avoid the situation
Avoid your occupation
Hardly surprising
Too busy socialising
The lying and the faking
The lying and the waiting

Where are you
Where are you
Where are you now

You're never here
When you're needed
Nothing ever heeded
Pretending and pretending
But you don't even try

Where are you
Where are you now

A car without an engine
A plane without a pilot

Where are you
Where are you now

Where are you
Where are you now

// Blue Water //

Oxygen
Aqua

Into the water

Splish, splosh
Bubbles
Swimming
Under the water
The blue water
Blue water

I'd give an arm
I'd give a leg
To be forever
Under the water
Blue water

Swimming
Under water
Blue water

I got my wish
I went splish
And I went splosh
And I got lost
Under the water
Blue water
I'd give a leg
To be forever
Blue water
Under the water
I'd give an arm
I'd give a leg
You chewed my guts
But not my head

Blue water
Blue water
Blue water

Blue water is feeding
Blue water

I'd give an arm
I'd give a leg
You chewed my guts
But left my head

Blue water
Blue water
Blue water

It's feeding
It's feeding
Water
Blue water
