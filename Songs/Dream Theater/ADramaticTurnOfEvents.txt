// On The Backs Of Angels //

Standing on the backs of angels
Destined to create
Mounting the attack
While heroes carry your weight

We spiral toward disaster
Survival fading faster

Riding out the wave
Content to feed off the machine
Leading us to death
The new American dream

You're blinded by your hunger
Beware, your days are numbered

Tears fall from the shameless
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter

Blurring lines drawn in between
What is right and what is wrong
Victims on the radar
Straining us along

We're onto your agenda
The dead end road to nowhere

Tears fall from the shameless
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter

Tears fall from the shameless
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter

Selfless are the righteous
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter

// Build Me Up, Break Me Down //

Today I will be your savior
Tomorrow a demon
You crave my erratic behavior
And watch my every move

Obsession at all cost
You'll be the death of me
Broken and torn apart
Why can't you let me be?

You build me up
You break me down
Until I'm falling to pieces
I crash and burn I never learn
I'm your guilty addiction

Build me up
Break me down

(Today... Savior...)
Tonight I am the new messiah
You deify
When I'm no longer desired
I'll be crucified

The one who's free from sin
The first to cast the stone
Fighting the fear within
I won't be left alone

You build me up
You break me down
Until I'm falling to pieces

The price I pay
To live this way
And the fantasy stays alive

I can't live up I can't let down
And leave you falling to pieces

I crash and burn
I never learn
I'm your morbid obsession

Build me up
Break me down

You build me up
You break me down
Until I'm falling to pieces

The price I pay
To live this way
And the fantasy stays alive

I can't live up I can't let down
And leave you falling to pieces

I crash and burn
I never learn
Your iconic fixation

Build me up
Break me down

// Lost Not Forgotten //

I am not immortal
I am just a man
A power-craving tyrant
Beyond the shadows in the sand

Men have come to fear me
Many bow and cry
Known across the desert
I am the one who will not die

I have faced the demons of our most desperate moments
I have been the one to defend our pride
I have worn the banner of my abandoned brothers
I will be the first one to give my life

Lost not forgotten
Reigning against the odds
Feared and respected living among the gods
Leading the empire
Spirit as black as coal
Lost not forgotten
King of the deathless soul

An epic novel no one's read
Pages torn and faded
The greatest story never told

Behold the kingdom I possess
Land of wealth and beauty
Where the streets are paved with gold

Once fearless and brave
A realm passed away
The ghosts of yesterday

Lost not forgotten
Reigning against the odds
Feared and respected living among the gods
Leading the empire
Spirit as black as coal
Lost not forgotten
King of the deathless soul

Lost not forgotten
Reigning against the odds
Feared and respected living among the gods
Leading the empire
Spirit as black as coal
Lost not forgotten
King of the deathless soul
