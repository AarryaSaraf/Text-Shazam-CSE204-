// In The Presence Of Enemies, Pt. 1 //

I saw a bright light, shinning there before
Walk to it, I waited've for the end
A final vision promising salvation
Of resurrection for a fallen man

Do you still wait for your god
And a symbol of your fate

I can free you from this hell and misery
You should never be ashamed my son
I can give you power beyond anything
Trust me, you will be the chosen one

I was forgotten, my body scorned and broken
My soul rejected, taketh by his blood
Your redemption, a sinner not worth saving
Forever taken from the one I loved

Do I still wait for my god
And a symbol of my fate

I can lead you down the path and back to life
All I ask is that you worship me
I can help you seek revenge and save yourself
Give you life for all eternity
Servants of the fallen, fight to pave the way
For the saviour's calling, on this wicked day
To unveil the madness with a vicious pain
One man rises up, standing in their way

Redemption, redemption for humanity

// Forsaken //

For a while I thought I fell asleep
Lying motionless inside a dream
Then rising suddenly, I felt a chilling breath upon me
She softly whispered in my ear!

Forsaken, I have come for you tonight
Awaken, look in my eyes and take my hand
Give yourself up to me!

I waited painfully for night to fall again
Trying to silence the fear within me
Out of the night and mist I felt a stinging kiss
And saw a crimson stain on her lips

I have to know your name
Where have I seen your face before?
My dear one, don't you be afraid

Forsaken, I have come for you tonight
Awaken, look in my eyes and take my hand
Give yourself up to me!

Take me far away!
Close your eyes and hold your breath
To the ends of the earth!

Forsaken, I have come for you tonight
Awaken, look in my eyes and take my hand
Forsaken, fly away with me tonight
Awaken, renew my life, now you are mine
Give yourself up to me!

// Constant Motion //

Tunnel vision at blinding speed
Controlling my thoughts, obsessing me
Void of any uncertainty
Throughout my very soul

Lost illusions of my control
Resisting all hope of letting go
Racing impulse of dark desire
Drives me through the night

I try to shut it down
It leaves me in the dust
No matter what I've found
I can never get enough

Frantic actions of insanity
Impulsive laced profanity
Long for elusive serenity
Way out of my control

Traveling through both
Space and time
Out of body, out of mind
Out of control
My wheels in constant motion

Spinning round and round it goes
I can't let up, I can't let go
Can't stop this flame from burning
Forever more into the night, blistering

Focus here, focus there
Cannot see the light
Falling down through the night
Sprawling everywhere!

Searching left, searching right!
Panic setting in
I can no longer fight
When will this end?

Accelerate, dislocate!
Set to crash and burn
Haven't got time to waste
Not planning to return!

Aggravate, agitate!
When will I ever learn?
There's no way out of here
Nowhere to turn!

Obsessive yearning
Compulsive burning
Still never learning

Insane random thoughts of neat disorder

Scattered wasteland surrounding me
Tattered memories of what used to be
Apocalyptic mind debris
Until we meet again

Traveling through both
Space and time
Out of body, out of mind
Out of control
My wheels in constant motion

Spinning round and round it goes
I can't let up, I can't let go
Can't stop this flame from burning
Forever more into the night, blistering

Traveling through both
Space and time
Out of body, out of mind
Out of control
My wheels in constant motion

Spinning round and round it goes
I can't let up, I can't let go
Can't stop this flame from burning
Can't stop the wheels from turning

Traveling through both
Space and time
You get yours and I got mine
Out of control
My wheels in constant motion

Spinning round and round it goes
I can't let up, I can't let go
Can't stop this flame from burning
Forever more into the night, blistering

// The Dark Eternal Night //

No one dared to
Speak of the terrible danger
The hideous ancient warnings
Forged in the void of night

He has risen up!
Out of the blackness, chaos
The last of the prophets sinister
A sickening monstrous sight

Through the stifling heat
Underneath the pale green moon
I burned with a thirst
To seek things not yet seen

Climbing endless stairs
Leading to the choking room
Eager to explore
His most shocking mysteries

Drifting beyond all time
Out of a churning sky
Drawn to the beckoning light
Of the dark eternal night

Black forces, rage in the vortex
Fighting, waves of destruction
Swallowing the echo of the universe

I am the last
Born of the blood of the pharaohs
The ultimate God of a rotting creation
Sent to unleash this curse

Restless crowds draw near
Nameless hooded forms appear
Amidst fallen ruins
Grotesque creatures battle

Shadowed on a screen
Yellow evil faces leer
Vacant monuments
Corpses of dead worlds left behind

Drifting beyond all time
Out of a churning sky
Drawn to the beckoning light
Of the dark eternal night

Trapped in a hellish dream!
Spinning past worlds unseen
And frightfully vanishing
Into the dark eternal night

Drifting beyond all time
Out of a churning sky
Drawn to the beckoning light
Of the dark eternal night

Trapped in a hellish dream!
Spinning past worlds unseen
And frightfully vanishing
Into the dark eternal night

// Repentance //

[VIII: Regret]

Hello Mirror!
So glad to see you, my friend
It's been a while

Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage running through my head
Patterns of my life I thought adorned me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament

Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done than haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
And learn the hard way
And sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me
A bitter fear at the thought of my amends

Hoping that the step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this unswept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done than haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
And learn the hard way
And just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

[IX: Restitution]

"Until that moment
I'd never felt like I'd failed at anything
I felt like I failed her
And I failed myself, and I failed my children
It's still really hard to deal with."

"I want to thank you for helping me
To see my own selfishness
And to tell you how regretful I am it has hurt you."

"I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the hospital, Grandpa
When you were on your deathbed
I'm sorry I didn't come to your funeral
I don't know if I was selfish or I just was too scared to face it
It's one of the biggest regrets of my life."

"I'm here to confess with you that what I did was wrong
And I'm asking for your forgiveness..."

"The only unforgivable thing hauls itself out of bed
Looks over my shoulder at the bloody English weather."

"I really regret not being able to see my friend Andy."

"One of my best friends, who's the godfather of my daughter
He asked me to sing or play something at his wedding
And I turned it down because I was busy and
I guess, too much of a chickenshit to do it
And I feel sorry for that, because it was a very, very close friend of mine."

"So, I wanted to apologize to anyone
That I've upset or offended by my words
It's just an opinion, but unfortunately
I tend to express it as a fact
And that's kind of arrogant. Isn't it?"

"I think it's the betrayal
It still haunts me."

"I'm sorry for what I did back then
I was a different person
I really was and I'm so sorry
I wish it wouldn't have happened, but it did
And I'm sorry. Will you forgive me?"

"I guess I'm simply sorry for being me and not you
I so often wish you could be here with me to show me the way."

[Mike Portnoy:]
"If we are painstaking about this phase of our development
We will be amazed before we are halfway through
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it

We will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace
No matter how far down the scale we have gone
We will see how our experience can benefit others
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear

We will lose interest in selfish things
And gain interest in our fellows
Self-seeking will slip away
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change

Fear of people and of economic insecurity will leave us
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us
What we could not do for ourselves

Are these extravagant promises? We think not
They have been fulfilled amongst others:
Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly
We will always be true to our principles."

"You're only as sick as your secrets
But the truth shall set you free."

"The truth is the truth
And so all you can do is live with it."

// Prophets Of War //

It burns deep down inside of me
We have ourselves to blame
Not questioning, accept it as the truth

Debate this fight, it's just cause
The facts do not support theirs
To liberate a people
And rid them of tyrant rule

Is it time to make a change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?

It's time to make the change!

Intrigued, got your attention
Deceived since the inception
Our brave fight for what reason?

Compelled, can we clean up this mess?
The loss of loved ones, a perverse request
They continue the same rhetoric
These derelicts that profit win or lose

Is it time to make a change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?

It's time to make the change!

Time for change!
Fight the fear!
Find the truth!
Time for change!

The only thing that I believe
Will help us see this through is faith
Pray they will forgive!

Forgive our arrogance
So we can make it right
Right what they have wronged

See you sweat
Unexpected, controversial
Get used to it
Things are gonna get personal
Your sympathy
A pitiful display, you stutter
Your empathy
Means nothing if there is no honor

Responsible
Of this you are incapable
We implicate, incriminate
Exacerbate, too much at stake

Our fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers
Sons and daughters forced
Perpetuating their ideals
A mindless act to stay the course

Is it time to make a change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?

Is it time to make a change?
Are we closer than before?
Can we help them break away?
Are we profiting from war?

Is it time to make a change
A change from what it's been?
Can we help them break away?
Is our patience wearing thin?

It's time to make a change!

Time for change!
Fight the fear!
Find the truth!
Time for change!

// The Ministry Of Lost Souls //

The water's edge is where she waits
Lost soul still wandering
Meant to die but she's stuck
Not crossing over

The other side is where he waits
His spirit reaching out
Meant to save but she's too scared
To take his hand

Living in a world without you (Drowning in the past)
Is living in no world at all
So now I call on you

Remember me, I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering was all in vain
It's almost over now

Don't turn your back on paradise!

Feeling scared, she's prepared
To give up everything
She can't stand
To feel like half of her is fading
He will choose the only way
To rid her of her pain
Take her soul now
The decision has been made

Living in a world without love (A burden to my soul)
Is living in a worthless world
So I will call on you

Remember me, I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering was all in vain
It's almost over now

Remember me, you were so young
How could I tell you?
Remember me, I am the one
Who saved your life that night

I was the one
Who would not abandon you
Even in death
I was the one who would not leave you

I used my freedom to protect you
And all the while direct you
Do you remember me this time?
Even in death, I gave you life

I gave you life!

I wanted to deserve a place
A place beside you
This time when I reached out my hand
It reached all the way to heaven

Remember me, I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering was all in vain
It's almost over now

Goodbye!
It's almost over now
Goodbye!

It's time
I release you from this life
Don't turn your back on paradise!

// In The Presence Of Enemies, Pt. 2 //

[III: Heretic]

Welcome tired pilgrim into the circle
We have been waiting
Everyone's gathered for your arrival
All the believers

Angels fall all for you, heretic
Demon heart, bleed for us!

I've been waiting for you
Weary preacher man
You have been expected
Now we can begin

Let this hallowed
Day of Judgment reign

I have known you father
And your sacred quest
Blessed soldier fighting
You shall never rest

I have known you
But do you know me?

Angels fall all for you, heretic
Demon heart, bleed for us!

My soul is yours, Dark Master!
I will fight for you!

Dark Master within, I will fight for you
Dark Master of sin, now my soul is yours
Dark Master, my guide, I will die for you
Dark Master inside!

I cannot see his face
But I could feel his spite
A presence from the dead
Abandoned by the light

This shadow will
Consume him from within

This power that I sense
The rage behind those eyes
Is just a shrouded ghost
A spirit sealed inside
The body and the soul both threats
For they are one!

Angels fall all for you, heretic
Demon heart, bleed for us!

My soul is yours, Dark Master!
I will fight for you!

Dark Master within, I will fight for you
Dark Master of sin, now my soul is yours
Dark Master, my guide, I will die for you
Dark Master inside!

Dark Master, amen
I belong to you!
Dark Master within

[IV: The Slaughter Of The Damned]

Don't bother, trying to find them
They will be coming to you
Fight, fight and destroy until you can't take anymore!
Slay, spill the blood of the rebels
They are the children of Hell
Flesh of the undead, stopping at nothing to kill

Sin, caught in a moment of weakness
Committed the greatest of all
Sold half of my soul and now it's too late for you

I judge as my eyes see
I judge and I am just
For I speak of the beast
That lives in all of us

Unwelcome ones
Your time has come!

Lord, you are my god and my shepherd
Nothing more shall I want
Walk through the abyss
Into the shadow of death

Fear, there is no evil to fear now
For I know you are with me
My cup overflows
With my enemy's blood

I decay in the house of the Lord
Forever amen

Death will follow me
All the days of my life

I judge as my eyes see
I judge and I am just
For I speak of the beast
That lives in all of us

Unwelcome ones
Your time has come!

Servants of the fallen fight to pave the way
For their savior's calling on this wicked day
Through a veil of madness, with a vicious blade
One man rises up, standing in their way

It's time for your reckoning!

[V: The Reckoning]

[Instrumental]

[VI: Salvation]

My soul grows weaker
He knows and he waits
He watches over me
Standing at the infernal gates

In the hour of darkness
The moment I feared has passed
The moment I lost my faith
Promising salvation

My soul is my own now!
I do not fight for you, Dark Master!
