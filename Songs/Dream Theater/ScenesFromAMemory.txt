// Scene One: Regression //

[Hypnotherapist:]
Close your eyes and begin to relax
Take a deep breath and let it out slowly
Concentrate on your breathing
With each breath you become more relaxed
Imagine a brilliant white light above you
Focus in on this light as it flows through your body
Allow yourself to drift off as you fall
Deeper and deeper into a more relaxed state of mind
Now, as I count back from ten to one
You will feel more peaceful and calm
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six
You will enter a safe place where nothing can harm you
Five, four, three, two
If at any time you need to come back
All you need to do is open your eyes
One

[Nicholas:]
Safe in the light that surrounds me
Free of the fear and the pain
My subconscious mind starts spinning through time
To rejoin the past once again

Nothing seems real, I'm starting to feel
Lost in the haze of a dream
And as I draw near, the scene becomes clear
Like watching my life on a screen
Hello, Victoria!
So glad to see you, my friend

// Scene Two: II. Strange Deja Vu //

Subconscious strange sensation
Unconscious relaxation
What a pleasant nightmare
And I can't wait to get there again

Every time I close my eyes
There's another vivid surprise
Another whole life waiting
Chapters unfinished, fading

Closer now
Slowly comin' into view
I've arrived
Blinding sunshine beamin' through

There's a house I'm drawn to
Familiar settings nothing new
And there's a pathway leading there
With a hauntin' chill in the air

There's a room at the top of the stairs
Every night I'm drawn up there
And there's a girl in the mirror
Her face is gettin' clearer

Young child, won't you tell me
Why I'm here?

In her eyes
I sense a story never told
Behind the disguise
There's something tearing at her soul

Tonight I've been searching for it
A feeling that's deep inside me
Tonight I've been searching for
The one that nobody knows
Trying to break free

I just can't help myself
I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head
Tears my heart into two
I'm not the one the sleeper thought he knew

Back on my feet again
Eyes open to the real world
Metropolis surrounds me
The mirror's shattered the girl

Why is this other life
Haunting me every day?
I'd break through to the other side
If only I'd find the way

Is something's awfully familiar?
The feeling's so hard to shake
Could I have lived in that other world?
It's a link that I'm destined to make

Still searchin' but I don't know what for
The missing key to unlock my mind's door

Today I am searching for it
A feeling that won't go away
Today I am searching for
The the one that I only know
Trying to break free

I just can't help myself
I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head
Tears my soul into two
I'm not the one I thought I've always knew

I just can't help myself
I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head
Uncanny, strange deja vu
But I don't mind, I hope to find the truth

// Scene Three: I. Through My Words //

All your eyes have ever seen
All you've ever heard
Is etched upon my memory
Is spoken through my words

All that I take with me
Is all you've left behind
We're sharing one eternity
Living in two minds
Linked by an endless thread
Impossible to break

// Scene Three: II. Fatal Tragedy //

Alone at night I feel so strange
I need to find all the answers to my dreams
When I sleep at night I hear the cries what does this mean?

I shut the door and traveled to another home
I met an older man he seemed to be alone
I felt that I could trust him, he talked to me that night

Lad did you know a girl was murdered here?
This fatal tragedy was talked about for years
Victoria's gone forever only memories remain

She passed away, she was so young

Without love, without truth
There can be no turning back
Without faith, without hope
There can be no peace of mind

As the night went on I started to find my way
I learned about a tragedy, a mystery still today

I tried to get more answers but he said, "You're on your own"
Then he turned away and left me as I stand there all alone
He said, "You'll know the truth as you future days unfold, unfold"

Without love, without truth
There can be no turning back
Without faith, without hope
There can be no peace of mind

Now it is time to see how you died
Remember that death is not the end
But only a transition

// Scene Four: Beyond This Life //

Headline "Murder, young girl killed
Desperate shooting at Echoe's hill
Dreadful ending, killer died
Evidently suicide"

A witness heard a horrifying sound
He ran to find a woman dead and
Lying on the ground

Standing by her was a man
Nervous, shaking, gun in hand
Witness says he tried to help
But he'd turned the weapon on himself

His body fell across that poor young girl
After shouting out in vain
The witness ran to call for assistance
A sad close to a broken love affair

Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are

She wanted love forever
But he had another plan
He fell into an evil way
She had to let him down
She said "I can't love a wayward man"

She may have found a reason to forgive
If he had only tried to change
Was their fatal meeting prearranged?

Had a violent struggle taken place?
There was every sign that lead there
Witness found a switchblade on the ground
Was the victim unaware?
They continued to investigate
They found a note in the killer's pocket
It could have been a suicide letter
Maybe he had lost her love

I feel there's only one thing left to do
I'd sooner take my life away than live with losing you

Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are
Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are

All that we learn this time
(What we have been is what we are)
Is carried beyond this life

// Scene Five: Through Her Eyes //

She never really had a chance
On that fateful moonlit night
Sacrificed without a fight
A victim of her circumstance

Now that I've become aware
And I've exposed this tragedy
A sadness grows inside of me
It all seems so unfair

I'm learning all about my life
By looking through her eyes

Just beyond the churchyard gates
Where the grass is overgrown
I saw the writing on her stone
I felt like I would suffocate

"In loving memory of our child
So innocent, eyes open wide"
I felt so empty as I cried
Like part of me had died

I'm learning all about my life
By looking through her eyes

And as her image
Wandered through my head
I wept just like a baby

As I lay awake in bed

And I know what it's like
To lose someone you love
And this felt just the same

She wasn't given any choice
Desperation stole her voice
I've been given so much more in life
I've got a son, I've got a wife

I had to suffer one last time
To grieve for her and say goodbye
Relieve the anguish of my past
To find out who I was at last

The door has opened wide
I'm turning with the tide
Looking through her eyes

// Scene Six: Home //

[Sleeper:]
Shine-lake of fire
Lines take me higher
My mind drips desire
Confined and overtired

Living this charade
Is getting me nowhere
I can't shake this charade
The city's cold blood calls me home
Home it's what I long for
Back home where I belong

The city, it calls to me
Decadent scenes from my memory
Sorrow, eternity
My demons are coming to drown me

Help, I'm falling, I'm crawling
I can't keep away from its clutch
Can't have it, this habit
It's calling me back to my home

[Miracle:]
I remember the first time she came to me
Poured her soul out all night and cried
I remember I was told there's a new love that's born
For each one that has died

I never thought that I
Could carry on with this life
But I can't resist myself
No matter how hard I try

Living their other life
Is getting them nowhere
I'll make her my wife
Her sweet temptations calls me home
Home, it's what I long for
My home where she belongs

Her ecstasy means so much to me
Even deceiving my own blood
Victoria watches and thoughtfully smiles
She's taking me to my home

Help, he's my brother, but I love her
I can't keep away from her touch
Deception, dishonor
It's calling me back to my home

[Nicholas:]
Her story, it holds the key
Unlocking dreams from my memory
Solving this mystery
Is everything that is a part of me

Help, regression, obsession
I can't keep away from her touch
Leave no doubt, to find out
It's calling me back to my home

// Scene Seven: II. One Last Time //

It doesn't make any sense this tragic ending
In spite of the evidence there's something still missing
Heard some of the rumors told a taste of one's wealth
Did Victoria wound his soul? Did she bid him farewell?

One last time, we'll lay down today
One last time, until we fade away
One last time, we'll lay down today
One last time, we slowly fade away, away

Here I am inside his home
It holds the many clues to my suspicions
And as I'm standing here right now
I'm finally shown what I have always known

Coincidence I can't believe
As my childhood dreams slowly come true
Are these her memories awakened through my eyes?
This house has brought back to life

An open door I walk on through into his bedroom
Feeling as cold as outside, the walls disappear
To some woman who's screaming
A man pleads forgiveness, his words I cannot hear

// Scene Eight: The Spirit Carries On //

Where did we come from?
Why are we here?
Where do we go when we die?
What lies beyond
And what lay before?
Is anything certain in life?

They say "Life is too short"
"The here and the now"
And "You're only given one shot"
But could there be more
Have I lived before
Or could this be all that we've got?

If I die tomorrow
I'd be alright
Because I believe
That after we're gone
The spirit carries on

I used to be frightened of dying
I used to think death was the end
But that was before
I'm not scared anymore
I know that my soul will transcend

I may never find all the answers
I may never understand why
I may never prove
What I know to be true
But I know that I still have to try

If I die tomorrow
I'd be alright
Because I believe
That after we're gone
The spirit carries on

"Move on, be brave
Don't weep at my grave
Because I'm no longer here
But please never let
Your memories of me disappear"

Safe in the light that surrounds me
Free of the fear and the pain
My questioning mind
Has help me to find
The meaning in my life again
Victoria's real
I finally feel
At peace with the girl in my dreams
And now that I'm here
It's perfectly clear
I found out what all of this means

If I die tomorrow
I'd be alright
Because I believe
That after we're gone
The spirit carries on

// Scene Nine: Finally Free //

[Hypnotherapist:]
You are once again surrounded by a brilliant white light
Allow the light to lead you away from your past and into this lifetime
As the light dissipates you will slowly fade back into
Consciousness, remembering all you have learned
When I tell you to open your eyes you will return to the present
Feeling peaceful and refreshed
Open your eyes Nicholas

[The Miracle (Edward):]
Friday evening
The blood still on my hands
To think that she would leave me now
For that ungrateful man
Sole survivor
No witness to the crime
I must act fast to cover up
I think that there's still time
He'd seem hopeless and lost with this note
They'll buy into the words that I wrote

This feeling
Inside me
Finally found my love
I've finally broke free
No longer
Torn in two
I'd take my own life before losing you

[Metropolis (Victoria):]
Feeling good this Friday afternoon
I ran into Julian
Said we'd get together soon
He's always had my heart
He needs to know
I'll break free of the Miracle
It's time for him to go

This feeling
Inside me
Finally found my love
I've finally broke free
No longer
Torn in two
He'd kill his brother if he only knew

Their love renewed
They'd rendezvous
In a pathway out of view
They thought no one knew
Then came a shot out of the night
"Open your eyes, Victoria"

One last time
We'll lay down today
One last time
Until we fade away

One last time
We'll lay down today
One last time
Until we fade away

[The Miracle:]
As their bodies lie still
And the ending draws near
Spirits rise through the air
All their fears disappear
It all becomes clear
A blinding light comes into view
An old soul exchanged for a new
Familiar voice comes shining through

This feeling
Inside me
Finally found my life
I'm finally free
No longer
Torn in two
I learned about my life by living through you
This feeling
Inside me
Finally found my life
I've finally broke free
No longer
Torn in two
Living my own life by learning from you

We'll meet again my friend
Someday soon

[News reporter:]
"... their lead story
All anticipating the outcome of the man considered to be a member of American nobility
And as you can imagine, as the skies have grown darker
Here over Washington
The moon has grown darker as well and people here are
Beginning to resign themselves to the possibility that they are
Witnessing yet another tragedy in a long string of misfortunes
Reaction from everywhere, from Washington and certainly
From around the world has guess..."
"Open your eyes, Nicholas'"

"Aaaah!"
