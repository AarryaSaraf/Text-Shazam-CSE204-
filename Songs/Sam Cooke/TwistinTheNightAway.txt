Album: TwistinTheNightAway

// Twistin' In The Kitchen With Dinah //

it seemed to me that I heard music
coming through the kitchen door
So I peeped in, saw my Dinah with a fellow
that I've never seen before

and he was twistin in the kitchen with my Dinah
twistin in the kitchen, I know
twistin in the kitchen with my Dinah
to the music of an old banjo

and singing
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,
singing
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,

And going around and around and around and around
around and around and around and around

And going around and around and around and around
around and around and around and around

Should have been my with My Dinah
Should have been me, I know
Should have been me, twistin in the kitchen
to the music of an old banjo

I saw him twistin in the kitchen with my Dinah
twistin in the kitchen, I know
he was twistin in the kitchen with my Dinah
to the music of an old banjo

and singing
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,
singing
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,
Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O, Fi-Fai-Fideli-I-O,

And going around and around and around
around and around and around and around

And going around and around and around and around
around and around and around and around

// Somebody's Gonna Miss Me //

Somebody's gonna miss me
Somebody's gonna miss me
Somebody's gonna miss me when I'm gone

Baby, somebody's gonna miss me
Somebody's gonna miss me
Somebody's gonna miss me when I'm gone

Yeah, when I begin to roam 
A long long way from home
I know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh yes you will
When your friends all put you down 
And there ain't nobody else around
I know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Baby let me tell you, I know you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Oh baby, I know you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Baby, I always kept you in my care
Ready to give and always to share
That's why you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh yes you will

Someday you may forget me
And regret the day that you ever met me
But still you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Baby let me tell you, I know you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Oh I know you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me
I know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

// A Whole Lotta Woman //

I've got a rocking chair that rocks
A rubber ball that rolls
I need a whole lot of woman
To satisfy my soul
It takes a lot woman yeah
To satisfy my soul

You know a boy needs a girl
She needs a ring that's made of gold
But I need a whole lot of woman, yeah
To satisfy my soul
It takes a lot woman
To satisfy my soul

I don't need no woman
I don't need her cause she's fine
I need a girl
A sweet little thing
To love me all of the time
You know fire makes me a hot
And ice keep 'em cold
But I need a whole lot of woman
To satisfy my soul
It takes a lot woman
To satisfy my soul
