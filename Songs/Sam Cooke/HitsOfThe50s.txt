// Hey There //

Hey there, you with the stars in your eyes
Love never made a fool of you
You used to be too, yes, Hey there
You on that high-flying cloud

Tough she won't throw a crumb at you
You think someday she'll come to you
Better forget her
her with her nose in the air
She has you dancing on a string
Break it and she won't care

Hey there, won't you take this advice
I hand you like a brother
Or are you not seeing things to clear
Are you too much in love to hear
Is it all going in one ear and out the other
hmm and out the other, in one ear and out the other

won't you take this advice
I hand you like a brother
Or are you not seeing things to clear
Are you too much in love to hear
Is it all going in one ear and out the other
hmm and out the other, in one ear and out the other

// Mona Lisa //

Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
It is only 'cause you're lonely
They have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile

Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you rael Mona Lisa
Or just as cold and lonely, lovely work of art

Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa
Or just as cold and lonely, lovely work of art

// Too Young //

They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love
They say that love's a word
A word we've only heard
But can't begin to know the meaning of
And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then some day they may recall
We were not too young at all
And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then some day they may recall
We were not too young at all

// The Great Pretender //

oh yes, I'm the Great pretender
pretending I'm doing well
my need is such
I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell

oh yes, I'm  the Great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I play the game
but to my real shame
You've left me to dream all alone

Too real is this feeling of make-belief
Too real when I feel what my heart can conceal
oh yes, I'm the Great pretender
just laughing and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

Too real is this feeling of make-belief
Too real when I feel what my heart can conceal
oh yes, I'm the Great pretender
just laughing and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

// You, You, You //

You, you. you
I'm in love with you, you, you
I could be so true, true, true
to someone like you, you, you

Do, do, do
what you ought to do, do, do
take me in your arms please do
let me cling to you, you, you

we were meant for each other
sure as heaven is above
To have, to hold and to love
You, you, you

There's no one like you, you, you
you could make my dreams come true
if you say you love me too

Do, do, do
what you ought to do, do, do
take me in your arms please do
let me cling to you, you, you

we were meant for each other
sure as heaven is above
To have, to hold and to love
You, you, you

There's no one like you, you, you
you could make my dreams come true
if you say you love me too

you, you, you
I'm in love with you

// Unchained Melody //

O, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
Times goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love
God speed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh
Wait for me, wait for me
I'll be coming home, wait for me

O, my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
Times goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love, I need your love
God speed your love to me

// The Wayward Wind //

O, the wayward wind is a restless wind
Is a restless wind that yearns to wander
On the eye was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind

And a lovely shack by a railroad track
I spent my younger days
and I guess the sound of the outward bound
made me a slave to my wandering days
and the wayward wind

O, the wayward wind is a restless wind
Is a restless wind that yearns to wander
On the eye was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind

I met her there in a border town
We vowed we'd never part
though I tried my best to settle down
now she's alone with the broken heart

O, the wayward wind is a restless wind
Is a restless wind that yearns to wander
On the eye was born the next of kin
The next of kin to the wayward wind

// Secret Love //

Once I had a secret love
that lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
became impatient to be free
So I told a friendly star
the way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
and why I'm so in love with you
Now I shouted from the highest hill
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love's no secret any more
At last my heart's an open door
And my secret love's no secret any more

// The Song From Moulin Rouge //

Whenever you kiss
I worry and wonder
Your lips maybe near
but where is your heart
It's always like this
I worry and wonder
You're close to me here
but where is your heart

It's a sad thing to realize
that you have a heart that never melts
when we kiss do your close you eyes
pretending that I'm someone else
You must break the spell
this cloud that I'm under
So please won't you tell
darling where is your heart

It's a sad thing to realize
that you have a heart that never melts
when we kiss do your close you eyes
pretending that I'm someone else
You must break the spell
this cloud that I'm under
So please won't you tell
darling where is your heart

// I'm Walking Behind You //

I'm walking behind you
and I'll hear your promise
to love and obey
tough you may forget me
you're still on my mind

Look over your shoulder
I'm walking behind
Maybe I'll kiss again
with a love that's new
But I shall wish again
I was kissing you
'Cause I'll always love you
wherever you go
And tough we are parted
I wan't you to know
That if things go wrong dear
and faith is unkind
Look over your shoulder
I'm walking behind

// Cry //

If your sweetheart, sends a letter, of goodbye
It's no secret, you'll feel better, if you cry
When waking from a bad dream,
don't you sometimes think it's real
Well it's only false emotions,
that you feel

If your heartaches seems to hang around too long
And your blues keep getting blue-er with each song
Remember, sunshine can be found behind a cloudy sky
So let your hair down and go on and cry

remember, sunshine can be found, behind a cloudy sky
so let your hair down and go on and cry
so let your hair down and go on and cry.

// Venus //

O Venus, hey Venus
make my dreams come true
Venus if you will
Send a little girl for me to thrill
A girl who wants my kisses and my arms
A girl with all the charms of you
Venus make her fair
a lovely girl with sunlight in her hair
and take the brightest stars up in the skies
And place them in her eyes for me

Venus, goddess of love that you are
Surely the things I ask can't be too great a task
Venus if you do, I promise that I always be true
I'll give her all the love I have to give
As long as we both shall love

O venus, O venus
make my dreams come true
O Venus
