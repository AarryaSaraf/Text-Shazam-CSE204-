Album: 19

// Daydreamer //

Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
Of making up the past
And feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt a figure before

A jaw-dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh

You can find him sittin' on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through

There's no way I could describe him
What I've said is just what I'm hoping for

But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life

// Best For Last //

Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me?
Yeah

Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough?
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say

I make you feel a way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak of running around
And I will do until I find myself with you and

Make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you'll never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you

// Chasing Pavements //

I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong, I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust
I know this is love

But if I tell the world
I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do
If I end up with you

Should I give up?
Or should I just keep chasin' pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste
Even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up?
Or should I just keep chasin' pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

I build myself up
And fly around in circles
Waitin' as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally, could this be it

Or should I give up?
Or should I just keep chasin' pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste
Even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?

Should I give up?
Or should I just keep chasin' pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

Should I give up?
Or should I just keep on chasin' pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste
Even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?

Should I give up?
Or should I just keep on chasin' pavements?
Should I just keep on chasin' pavements?
Ohh oh

Should I give up?
Or should I just keep chasin' pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste
Even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?

Should I give up?
Or should I just keep chasin' pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

// Cold Shoulder //

You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it 'round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time (every time)

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't admitting you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too

When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that I don't see you
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
'Though I do know how you play

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

// Crazy For You //

Found myself today
Singing out loud your name
You said I'm crazy
If I am I'm crazy for you

Sometimes sitting in the dark
Wishing you were here
Turns me crazy
But it's you who makes me lose my head

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool

Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me gone, I'll leave
Just hold me closer, baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

Lately with this state I'm in
I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over
Send me spinning closer to you

My oh my, how my blood boils
It's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favourite mood

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for you

// Melt My Heart To Stone //

Right under my feet is air made of bricks
It pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
And I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Why do you steal my hand?
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You build me up, then leave me dead

Well I hear your words you made up
[Album version:] I say your name like there should be an us
[Live version:] So I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

// First Love //

So little to say but so much time,
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind.
Please wear the face, the one where you smile,
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry.

Forgive me first love, but I'm tired.
I need to get away to feel again.
Try to understand why,
don't get so close to change my mind.
Please wipe that look out of your eyes,
it's bribing me to doubt myself;
Simply, it's tiring.

This love has dried up and stayed behind,
And if I stay I'll be a lie
Then choke on words I'd always hide.
Excuse me first love, but we're through.
I need to taste a kiss from someone new.

Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired.
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire.
Forgive me first love,
Forgive me first love,
Forgive me first love,
Forgive me first love,
Forgive me,
Forgive me first love,
Forgive me first love

// Right As Rain //

Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say "I chose to be alone"
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

See when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Go ahead and steal my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
When we were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game

'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of...

There ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Woah, yeah! Had enough
Woah oh oh oh oh!
Woah oh oh do da!

// Make You Feel My Love //

When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love

// My Same //

You say I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving I think way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say, "Pff, I've known you longer, my dear."
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other, think we'd never match at all, but we do
But we do, but we do, but we do

I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
And you're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You'd think we wouldn't, we do, but we do, but we do, but we do

Favouritism ain't my thing but in this situation I'd be glad...

Favouritism ain't my thing but in this situation I'd be glad to make an exception

You say I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving, I think way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say, "Pff, I've known you longer, my dear."
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other, think we'd never match at all, but we do

// Tired //

Hold my hand while you cut me down
It'd only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
When I fell off your mind

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired

Where'd you go when you stay behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired

I should have known

"Never mind," said your open arms
I couldn't help believe you trick me back into them
Even though...

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired

// Hometown Glory //

I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
"Is there anything I can do for you dear? Is there anyone I could call?"
"No and thank you, please Madam. I ain't lost, just wandering"

Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now

I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love it to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides

Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
(Doo-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dah, yeah
Doo-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dah, yeah
Doo-doo-doo-doo ooh-ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah-ey)

Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world
Yeah
Of my world
Of my world yeah

// That's It, I Quit, I'm Movin' On //

When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on

The other night
We had a date
And you showed up
Two hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Yeah that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on

Oooohhhh

You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby, I can take a lot
Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Yeah that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on

Oooohhhh

You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby
I can take a lot
Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
So that's it baby
I quit now I'm movin' on
So that's it baby
I quit now
I'm movin' on

// Now And Then //

Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart
So bad it cuts through the deepest parts of me
And fills up my mouth with the words that cry
How I'm still trying to stay inside

Hearts break and hands wait
To make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Our hearts break and hands wait
To make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Every now and then my memories ache
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd made, yeah
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest

'Cause hearts break and hands wait
To make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Our hearts break and hands wait
To make us grow fonder
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here
You know when to make me imagine you're here

// Painting Pictures //

Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life
Ooh

Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me
I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel
Leave

I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me 
So scratch my itch and beat my drum 
So i can start to begin what's begun

Painting pictures 
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Painting pictures 
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
Ooh
Scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun

Painting pictures 
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Painting pictures 
Filling up my heart with golden stories

// Many Shades Of Black //

Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor
Take whatever's left, and take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say it's been that way
No, in fact it's been wasted on you

Everybody sees and everyone agrees
That you and I are old
And it's been that way too long
Take it as it comes, and be thankful when its done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black

Let it out, let it all out and say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream, and shout and say things that are, so unkind
Yeah
See if I care
See if I stand firm or if i fall
Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue is the answer to you

Everybody sees and everyone agrees
That you and I are old
And it's been that way too long
Take it as it comes, and be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah, there's many shades of black

Ohhhhh

Yeah everybody sees and everyone agrees
That you and I are old
And it's been that way too long
Take it as it comes, and be thankful when its done
There's so many ways to act
And you cannot take it back
Oh, you cannot take it back
Cause there's many shades of black
You have many shades of black
You have many, you have many shades of black
Cause there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
There's so many shades of black

Ohhhh ohhhh
