It was February
I was cold and I was high
It was February
I was cold and I was high

He looked up
He lost control
He was degloved
He was jelly roll

It was February
I was cold and I was high

He wanted love, he wanted soul
He wanted soul
There's not enough
To make him whole

It was February
I was cold, and I was high

The swell of heaven on my dashboard
I can see my spinal cord rip high
Hey, hey, hey
It's raining glass like a fever storm
Every promise I have sworn tonight
Hey, hey, hey

The swell of heaven on my dashboard
I can see my spinal cord swing high
High
It's raining glass like a fever storm
Every promise I have sworn tonight

It was February
I was cold and I was high
High, high, high
It was February
I was cold and I was

For the storm
Are you ready for?
Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for?
Are you ready for the storm?

Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for?
Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for?
Are you ready for the storm?

Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for?
Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for?
Are you ready for the storm?

Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for?
Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for?
Are you ready for the storm?

// THE WHEEL //

I got on my knees, and I begged my mother
With the bottle in one hand, it's one or the other
And so it turns, again and again

She woke from a slumber, with a crippled stance
She said she missed my brother, and wanted one more chance
And so it turns, again and again

The wheel

And so, it turns
And so, it turns

Can I get a hallelujah?
The one from the back, now
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get a hallelujah?
Hear it from the back, now
Can I get a hallelujah?
Hey!

Hey!

So, I put up a poster, saying, "Where's my dog
My friends, my family, my job?"

Nobody turned back now, except for my man
With a mournful pious grin, and a bag in his hand
And so it turns, again and again

And then the seagulls found me, I couldn't tell what year
But with no one around me, the motion was clear
And so it turns, again and again

The wheel

And so it turns
And so it turns

Can I get a hallelujah?
Hear it from the back now
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get a hallelujah
Hear it for the users?
Can I get a hallelujah?

Can I get a hallelujah
Can I hear it from the back now?
Can I hear the hallelujah?
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get a hallelujah?

// WHEN THE LIGHTS COME ON //

The tapping of the feet seem loud
There's a girl in a whirlwind cloud
I danced with a Spaniard man
'Til we had no breath left in our pounding chests

I shudder like I'm all bereft
Danced grief from my pores
The beat pounds like a knocking at the door

The hi-hats dance like a feather
I'm in, I'm in a paralytic loveless dream
Not a single face I've seen
Is a friend I recognise or recognises me

I blackout

I don't want your dim sum
It's 3 AM, I wanna dance 'til the sun comes
I wanna fight your cousin
I wanna tear through the night like an angel flare
I'm a ten-foot snare
That cuts in the sky with no care
No care, no care, no

A narcissist on a cucking stool

The kids are not alright
The kids are not all

Feels like I'm coming home
Feels like I'm coming home

A narcissist a cucking stool

The kids are not alright
The kids are not

// CAR CRASH //

I got myself together
I got myself in check
I made myself a member
Got myself out the red
I upgraded my upgrade
Give us our daily bread
I got paid on payday
Now I dress well-fed
I clearly won the friendly
Left my opponent dead
I got the keys to the Lambo
I took a walk instead
I am the prophecy
I did not come from nothing
And nothing came from me
I took your name in vain
I burnt your effigy
I chewed up your story
Some tush between my teeth
The fear's gargantuan
Don't like what I can see
Racist prick on the right side
No one to trust on the left
So I put my foot on overdrive
Close my eyes and press
Definitely I'll have a dab man
You know I am a dab hand
Super strength superman
I'll have a stab and can-can
Don't forget I'm a champ man
Pound for pound gram for gram
I'll smash that double-barrel Mitsubishi
Back to Amsterdam
Crash bang wallop on the afghan
Then I rise like a phoenix from the dashcam

Smash!
I'm a car crash

I got myself together
I got myself in check
You caught me on my knees
Knees are raw red
You caught me on all fours
Smooching the floor
No metaphor
My thoughts are piss poor
My glass-jaw held open the door
Chin to tarmac
I'm serious Jack
As a heart attack
No life, no help, nobody
Was where I'm at
Smash swing glisten
As everything turns black
My feet leave the ground
As my wings start to flap
Cold goes to warm
As my top gets blood damp
My oh my I can feel the raw
Flesh on the bottom of the footwell floor
Flash! Flash!
Everything is turning to black ash

Smash
I'm a car crash

I can feel my eyes vibrate
I can feel my eyes vibrate
I can feel my eyes vibrate
I can feel my eyes vibrate

// THE NEW SENSATION //

Everybody stand up for a bit
Get up on your feet and get down for a bit
Shake it to the snare and get down to the kick
Shake your tiny tooshie like you don't give a shit

Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation

So you wanna re-train now?
Jumping from the right to the left brain now
You just gotta change your stance up
And re-train as a dancer and

Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation

Okay, get on all floors then slap that d-d-d-dancefloor
Then scream 'I'll die for the cause'
What else could your lungs be for and

Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation

Yeah boy, just break your back
Salute the DJ for the music crack
Yeah girl, just snap that neck
Shake so hard, shake the demons shook dead and

Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation

Shake your shit like your shit's on fire
Shimmy real hard like you're Richard Pryor
Liar, liar, put your flames to the tyre
Raise that roof like a Notre-Dame spire and

Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation

Everybody stand up for a bit
Get up on your feet and get down for a bit
Shake it to the snare and get down to the kick
Shake your tiny tooshie like you don't give a shit

Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation
Do the new sensation

Don't think, just follow, don't think

Don't think, just follow, don't think
Don't think, just follow, don't think
Don't think, just follow, don't think
Don't think, just follow, don't think)

Do the new sensation, do the new sensation

Do the new sensation, do the new sensation
(Don't think, just follow, don't think)
Do the new sensation, do the new sensation

// STOCKHOLM SYNDROME //

He says he's a nihilist quaking on a mound of slaughtered kings
Sniffing on solvents, solving solutions of what the future brings

A royalist and a drug user walk into a bar
Both buy their captors drinks accusing the other's gone too far

Uh huh

Just give them enough rope
Just give them enough rope
How can I feel myself when I can't even feel my face?
I've got more stories to tell but I can't remember time nor place

Just wash your hands and teach your hostage how to keep them clean
Just watch your neck and cut the nonsense with Hume's guillotine

He says he's a pacifist, quaking on a pile of collected things
Tearing at his infant lungs whilst the vapour choir sings

He danced with chaos, lost his feet because chaos chews his youth
Just suck the marrow, boy, don't bite off what you can't chew

Huh

Just give them enough rope
Just give them enough rope
How can I feel myself when I can't even feel my face?
I've got more stories to tell but I can't remember time nor place

Let's see how the vapour choir sing
Just don't, just don't

// THE BEACHLAND BALLROOM //

They could hear me scream for miles
The silence ringing for days
The wind that turns the trees
Made me sway, made me sway
Made me sway
Doberman, they stood proud
The ferns loomed as I lay
The waves slapped like shins to wood
And I laid, I laid, I laid
Inch by inch, foot by foot
I was on my knees for days
And then I set on all fours
And I made, I made, I made, I made

I'm not praying, baby
I'm not begging, darling
I'm not praying, baby
I'm not begging, darling

Soon as the rush went away
I need not look for a way
Damage, damage, damage

If you see me down on my knees
Please, do not think that I pray
Damage, damage, damage

Soon as the rush went away
I need not look for a way
Damage, damage, damage

If you see me down on my knees
Please, do not think that I pray
Damage, damage, damage

Damage, damage, damage

// CRAWL! //

So alive
Some way up
So tired
Some lay up

I a bleeder
Oh, I yearn
High seer
So K up

Hold the phone
Put the call in
Don't go
I'm falling
For a bore
Appalling
I'm so
So foreign

"Goddamn, I'm feeling good"
Said the liar to the congregation
And I know I'm not what I should
That's why I'm smashing my pretty face in

Yeah, I'm on my knees for porcelain
'Cause it felt like good to me
And, yeah, I'm a fucking crawler
Crawling hurts but it works for me
I'm alright, I'm alright
I'm alright, I'm alright

I'm feeling mani-fucking-fique
I'm feeling mani-fucking-fique

So pure
So heater
So sure

And, yeah, I'm a fucking crawler
Crawling hurts but it works for me
I'm alright, I'm alright

I'm feeling mani-fucking-fique
I'm feeling mani-fucking-fique

I'm on the way
I know it looks bad but I cannot wait
I ride the wave
No rest for the lamb as he goes all day
I ride the wave
No rest for the lamb as he goes all day
I'm on the way
I know it looks bad but I cannot wait
I ride the wave
I ride the wave

And, yeah, I'm on my knees for porcelain
'Cause it felt like good to me
And, yeah, I'm a fucking crawler
Crawling hurts but it works for me
I'm alright, I'm alright
I'm alright, I'm alright

I'm feeling mani-fucking-fique

// MEDS //

Jesus loves a trier
Call off the town crier
Climb that razor wire and medicate, meditate, medicate

Hide your crescent bruise
Shine your nation's shoes
Tie your owner's noose and medicate, meditate, medicate

Class guilt got me here
Smash pills, feel no fear
I came in from the rear to medicate, meditate, medicate

Drugs lost what I had found
Burnt friendships to the ground
Turn my frown upside down and medicate, meditate, medicate

Adorn the house within
Lather baby skin
Alleviate your kin, now that's what I call medication

Medication

Ornament is crime
Appreciate the wine
Your card has been declined, so medicate, meditate, medicate

(Real nice Bo, real nice
Yeah)

I'm crazy about my baby
I'm crazier inside
I've got plenty who'd come and save me
But I choose to run and hide

I'm crazy about my baby
But I'm crazier inside
I've got plenty who'd come and save me
But I choose to run and hide

Draft your pedants will
Embalm the shoes you fill
Only shoot to kill, then meditate, medicate, meditate

Bang Bang off the train

Hmmm Pink Champagne

// KING SNAKE //

I'm the duke of nothing, I'm the sultan of sans
The, the king of diddly, I'm the shell of man
I'm the emperor of zip, the leader of nought
I'm the God of zilch, a vacuum of thought

Here lies
Here lies

The jack of fuck all, the master of none
The champion of nada, a neglectable sum
I'm yesterday's news, tomorrow's chip paper
I'm in between jobs, and I will be later

Here lies
Here lies

A drop in the ocean, a shadow in the night
A wheel with no motion, a dog with no, bite
The deputy manager's assistant's assistant's assistant's assistant's
Assistant's assistant's assistant's assistant's assistant

Don't like, don't listen
Yeah

Here lies
Here lies
Here lies
Here lies

God damn!
God damn!
Woo!

Cuts like a knife, stings like a tick, kicks like a mule
Acts like a prick, acts like a prick

Burn like a fire, feels like an itch, hum like a choir
Act like a dick, act like a dick

Cuts like a knife, stings like a tick, kicks like a mule
Acts like a prick, acts like a prick

Burns like a fire, feels like an itch, hung like a choir
Act like a dick, act like a dick

God damn!
God damn!

In spite of it all
Life is beautiful

In spite of it all
Life is beautiful

Strong like an ox, bruise like a peach
Eyes like a hawk, drunk as a lord
Acts like a prick

Sick as a dog, white as a sheet
Sleep like a log, work like a charm
Lost in a dream

God damn!
God damn!

In spite of it all
Life is beautiful

God damn!
God damn!
