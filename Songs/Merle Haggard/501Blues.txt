// If You Want To Be My Woman //

You like riding in the country in my Cadillac
But when I try to kiss you, you keep on pushing me back
You say you like to party on the money that I earned
But you refuse to give me something equal in return

Don't look at me like maybe you don't understand
If you want to be my woman
Then you know you've got to let me be your man

Well, you said you was from the country, but I know that isn't true
You try to play it smart and look so innocent too
You say I need a ring to get the loving that I need
Can't you give me just a sample, hon, before I sign the deed?

Don't look at me like maybe you don't understand
If you want to be my woman
Then you know you've got to let me be your man

You gotta let
You gotta let
You gotta let
If you want to be my woman
Then you know you've got to let me be your man
