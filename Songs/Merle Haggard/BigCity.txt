// You Don't Have Very Far To Go //

You always find a way, to hurt my pride
If I'm not cryin', you're not, satisfied
I don't know why you want to, hurt me so
If you're tryin' to break my heart,
You don't have very far to go

You don't have very far to go before the heartaches, begin
I already feel the sadness, of a heartbreak, settin' in
You've turnin' down the flame of love, too low
If you're tryin' to break my heart,
You don't have very far to go

Turn around 

You don't have very far to go before the heartaches begin
I already feel the sadness of a heartbreak settin' in
You can't love me and still love, to hurt me so
If you're tryin' to break my heart
You don't have very far to go
