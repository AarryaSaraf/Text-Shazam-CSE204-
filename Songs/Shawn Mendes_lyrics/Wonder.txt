Album: Wonder

// Intro //

You have a million different faces
But they'll never understand
Unless you let them in
You've been a million different places
So I guess I'll have a chance to
Get lost in wonderland
Oh

// Wonder //

I wonder if I'm being real
Do I speak my truth or do I filter to how I feel?
I wonder, wouldn't it be nice
To live inside a world that isn't black and white?
I wonder what it's like to be my friends
Hope that they don't think I forget about them
I wonder
I wonder

Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreaming that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
Yeah
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by...

I wonder why I'm so afraid
Of saying something wrong and never said I was a saint
I wonder when I cry into my hands
I'm conditioned to feel like it makes me less of a man
And I wonder if some day you'll be by my side
And tell me that the world will end up alright
I wonder
I wonder

Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreaming that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
Yeah
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you

I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
Yeah
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
I wonder what it's like to be loved by...

Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreaming that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you

// Higher //

I can't get much higher

New York in the summertime
Get close with a bottle of wine
Last year was a broken heart
Last year was a broken heart
Last year was a broken heart
Damn, flip it around, what a beautiful start

You and me on the top of the roof
Slow dance in the light of the moon
Never thought it would get this far
Never thought it would get this far
Never thought it would get this far
Wow, flip it around, what a beautiful start

The drinks are getting better
The view is looking nice
As long as we're together
No, I can't get much higher
No I can't get much higher
Let's stay like this forever
I'll kiss you every night
As long as we're together
No, I can't get much higher
No, I can't get much higher

All eyes are looking at us
But I can't stop falling in love
Always been the one that I want
Always been the one that I want
Always been the one that I want
Wow, look at us now, damn, what have we done
I almost can't believe it
So please don't wake me if I'm dreaming
Whenever I'm with you

The drinks are getting better
The view is looking nice
As long as we're together
No, I can't get much higher
No, I can't get much higher
Let's stay like this forever
I'll kiss you every night
As long as we're together
No, I can't get much higher
No, I can't get much higher

Say
Say you won't let go
All I know is I can't get much higher
I can't get much higher

The drinks are getting better
The view is looking nice
As long as we're together
No, I can't get much higher
No, I can't get much higher
Let's stay like this forever
I'll kiss you every night
As long as we're together
No, I can't get much higher
No, I can't get much higher

// 24 Hours //

All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon but I wanna come home to you

I don't know how this will go
I promise that I'll love you so
I'll bet it all on me and you
I'll bet it all you're bulletproof

Let's throw away our backup plans
And people might not understand
Who cares about if they approve
I'd face them all to be with you

All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon but I wanna come home to you
All it'd take is 24 hours
We could dance, you could throw the flowers
It's a little soon but I wanna come home to you

I heard that once a wise man said
Only fools go rushing in
But I'm not the type to overthink
When something feels so right
And I promise I mean every word
I'll paint the world that you deserve
Every color you'd imagine
I can't wait for it happen

'Cause all it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon but I wanna come home to you
All it'd take is 24 hours
We could dance, you could throw the flowers
It's a little soon but I wanna come home to you

I heard that once a wise man said
Only fools go rushing in
But I'm not the type to overthink
I'm not the type to overthink
All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon but I wanna come home to you

All it'd take is 24 hours
Sign the check and the place is ours
It's a little soon but I wanna come home to you

// Teach Me How To Love //

Ooh, your body's like an ocean
I'm devoted
To explore you
Ooh, what do you desire
I'm inspired
I'll do it for you

Won't you draw a map for me
Laced with strawberries
And I'll get on my knees

Put my hands around you
Ooh, teach me how to
Touch you, tease, caress you and please you
Teach me how to love
Put my hands around you

Your imagination
Now I'm fixated
And I'm dying to learn

F'ing me up
I'm what you deserve

Just draw a map for me
Laced with strawberries
And I'll get on my knees

Put my hands around you
Ooh, teach me how to
Touch you, tease, caress you and please you
Teach me how to love
Put my hands around you

Touch you, tease, caress you and please you

// Call My Friends //

Right now I'm alone inside the airport
And you're all at a bar in our hometown
Feels like we been living different lives

The music's loud and everybody's dancing
How many nights I've missed, yeah I've lost count
Haven't seen your faces in a while

I should call my friends

I should call my friends and go get high
I need a vacation from my mind
I wanna go, nobody knows me better than them
Wanna feel something again
I should call my friends

I don't wanna miss another birthday
Feels like it's been forever since nineteen
I just wanna be right where you are

I miss how it was when we wished we were older
Feeling so far when I wanna be closer
I should call my friends

I should call my friends and go get high
I need a vacation from my mind
I wanna go, nobody knows me better than them
Wanna feel something again
I should call my friends

Ooh, I know you gotta make some sacrifices
Ooh, don't wanna be alone for one more night
Ooh, I know you gotta make some sacrifices
I should call my friends

I should call my friends
I should call my friends and go get high
I need a vacation from my mind
I wanna go, nobody knows me better than them
Wanna feel something again
I should call my friends

// Dream //

Dream, dream, dream, dream

Hello, hello, hello
Can I hear an echo
Purple red and yellow
I can't wait to get home
Head down on the pillow
Holding you is all I think about

You're asleep in London
I wish you were coming
Back home to me darling
You're too far away
Count back from one hundred
Holding you is all I think about

Oh baby
When I'm apart from you
I just shut my eyes
All I have to do

Is dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
(About you, about you, about you, about you)

Hello, hello, hello
Walking through a meadow
Full of sunflowers, picking off the petals
I don't wanna wake up without you laying next to me
Yeah
I'm no good at waiting
All the separation
Feeling suffocated
I just need to breathe
And I'm starting to hate it
I can't wait to fall asleep

Oh baby
When I'm apart from you
I just close my eyes
And all I have to do

Is dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
(About you, about you, about you, about you)
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
(About you, about you, about you, about you)

Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
(About you, about you, about you, about you)

Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you

// Song For No One //

I wake up
A little drunk
Check my phone
I'm all alone
Ten missed calls
A couple texts
None of them are who I'm looking for
Who I'm looking for, yeah

This is a song for no one
This is a song for no one

Get on a plane
Fly to the most beautiful place you've ever been
Close my eyes
Things are better in my dreams
'Cause I'm with someone
Someone I adore

This is a song for no one
I wrote this song for no one

Yesterday, I got pretty drunk
Said some things that I shouldn't of
Told you that I really love you
You did not reciprocate those feelings
But that's okay, I'll be fine anyway

Oh, yeah

I wrote this song for no one
I wrote this song
Woo, woo, woo, woo
No, I wrote this song for no one

// Monster //

You put me on a pedestal and tell me I'm the best
Raise me up into the sky until I'm short of breath (Yeah)
Fill me up with confidence, I say what's in my chest
Spill my words and tear me down until there's nothing left
Rearrange the pieces just to fit me with the rest, yeah

But what if I, what if I trip?
What if I, what if I fall?
Then am I the monster?
Just let me know
And what if I, what if I sin?
And what if I, what if I break? Yeah
Then am I the monster? Yeah
Just let me know, yeah

I was fifteen when the world put me on a pedestal
I had big dreams of doin' shows and making memories
Made some bad moves tryna act cool, upset by their jealousy
Lifting me up (Lifting me up), lifting me up (Yeah)
And tearing me down (Down), tearing me down (Down, down)
I'll take responsibility for everything I've done (Yeah)
Holding it against me (Yeah) like you're the holy one (Yeah)

I had a chip on my shoulder, had to let it go
'Cause unforgiveness keeps them in control
I came in with good intentions then I let it go
And now I really wanna know

What if I, what if I trip? (Oh)
What if I, what if I fall? (I fall)
Then am I the monster? (Am I the monster?)
Just let me know (Let me know)
And what if I, what if I sin? (Oh)
And what if I, what if I break? (Yeah)
Then am I the monster? (Am I the monster?)
Just let me know (Oh, please just let me know, yeah)

La-da-da-duh-duh (Baby what if I fall?)
La-da-da-duh-duh-duh-na
La-da-da-da-duh-duh
La-da-da-duh-duh-duh-na
La-da-da-duh-duh (Please don't let me fall)
La-da-da-duh-duh-duh-na
La-da-da-da-duh-duh (Oh, please don't let me fall)
La-da-da-duh-duh-duh-na

// 305 //

It's 3:05
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go
Never been so sure in my life

You're my sunlight on a rainy day
Would take my heart with you if you walked away
I'm a mess right now
I'm a wreck right now
I'm waiting for the moment that you let me down

If you cut the cord
I don't know what I'd do
Don't wanna skydive without my parachute
I'm a mess right now
Baby, help me out
I'm scared I'm gonna wake up
And you'll let me down

This feeling doesn't fade no matter how hard that I try
I always think about it at the same time every night

It's 3:05
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go
Never been so sure in my life
I'm terrified
You'll turn around and say goodbye
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go
I've never been so sure in my life

If there's a door to heaven, baby, you're the key
And if I had to beg, I'd be on my knees
Oh, please don't say
Anything has changed
You're the one I wanna wake up next to every day

This feeling doesn't fade no matter how hard that I try
I always think about it at the same time every night

It's 3:05
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go
Never been so sure in my life
I'm terrified
You'll turn around and say goodbye
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go
I've never been so sure in my life

(I want to be with you)
(I want to fly with you)
(I want to be with you)

It's 3:05
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go
Never been so sure

Baby, I'm terrified
You'll turn around and say goodbye
(Hoping you don't change your mind)
Please, don't change your mind (I don't wanna let go)
(I've never been so sure in my life)

// Always Been You //

It's a fairy tale I can't explain
Full of words I don't know how to say
And without a little twist of fate
I know I'd still be searching, baby
I swear that you've been sent to save me
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to

It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you

And you've seen all my darkest fears
Like you've known me for a thousand years
The boy who's really underneath
All the scars and insecurities, baby
I swear that you've been sent to save me
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to

It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to

It's always been you, yeah!
It's always been you
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to

// Piece Of You //

Yeah, it makes me wanna cry
Don't know what to do
It's so hard, but it's true
Everybody wants a piece

I get reckless, I'm obsessive
I'm pathetic and possessive
You're so sure it makes me insecure
You're majestic, mesmerizing
Light the room up without tryin'
Baby, I'm so into you, it hurts

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, it just isn't fair
What you put in the air
I don't wanna share

Everybody wants a piece of you
I get jealous, but who wouldn't when you look like you do
From the second you walk in the room
My night is ruined
Everybody wants a piece

One, two, three
So do I, maybe I'm selfish
Just one touch is so electric
Every little thing you do feels right, yeah
I'm sorry if I get protective
Need these boys to get the message
You know I'm yours, I know you're mine

Everybody wants a piece of you
I get jealous, but who wouldn't when you look like you do
From the second you walk in the room
My night is ruined
Everybody wants a piece

It's so hard, but it's true
It's so hard, but it's true
Everybody wants a piece

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, it just isn't fair
What you put in the air
I don't wanna share

Everybody wants a piece of you, they all want a piece
I get jealous, but who wouldn't when you look like you do
From the second you walk in the room
My night is ruined
Everybody wants a piece

// Look Up At The Stars //

Look up at the stars
They're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground

It's a Friday night
And the streetlights are all saying your name
They always say your name
Before you go home
I should let you know
I'm so glad that you came
I know that we went late, but

Look up at the stars
They're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground
You know we could fly so far
The universe is ours
I'm not gonna let you down

I am feeling so lucky (Lucky, lucky, lucky)
The sun shining down on me (On me, on me, on me)
Got these angels all around me
I'll never be alone

Look up at the stars
They're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground
You know we could fly so far
The universe is ours
And I'm not gonna let you down

Finally we've met
Now the lights are set
It's taken us till now
To be together in this town, yeah
A couple of years we've been making plans
Somehow you always seem to understand
So let me spend the night in wonderland with you

I am feeling so lucky (Lucky, lucky, lucky)
The sun shining down on me (On me, on me, on me)
Got these angels all around me
I'll never be alone

Look up at the stars
They're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground
You know we could fly so far
The universe is ours
And I'm not gonna let you down

// Can't Imagine //

I can't imagine what a world would be
I can't imagine what a world would be
I can't imagine what a world would be
Without you
All the birds would stop their songs
Without you
All things right would feel so wrong
I can't imagine what a world would be
No, I can't imagine what a world would be
No, I can't imagine what a world would be
Without you

I'd always be alone
Without you
I don't know where to go
I can't imagine what a world would be
No, I can't imagine what a world could be
I can't imagine what a world would be

I can't imagine
I can't imagine, no
I can't imagine, no, what a world would be

Without you
I'd always be alone
I'd always be alone

Cool, that's good for now

// The Christmas Song //

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe, mm-mm
Helps to make the seasons bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that (San—, san—), Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies for his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna try
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Ooh, ah-ooh
Ah

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

// Can't Take My Eyes Off You //

You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You're just like Heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last, love has arrived
And I just thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothin' else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
So if you feel how I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

I love you, baby
And if it's quite alright
I need you, baby
For the lonely nights
My, pretty baby
Just know that it's true

Oh, pretty baby
Don't hold me down, I pray
I need you baby
Now that I've found you, stay
And let me love you, baby
Let me love you

You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off of you
You're just like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I just thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off of you

I love you, baby
And if it's quite alright
I need you, baby
For the lonely nights
I need you baby
Just know that it's true, yeah

Oh, pretty baby
Don't hold me down, I pray
I need you baby
Now that I've found you, stay
And let me love you, baby
Let me love you
