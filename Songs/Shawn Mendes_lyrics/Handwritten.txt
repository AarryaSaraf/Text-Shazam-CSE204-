// Life Of The Party //

I love it when you just don't care
I love it when you dance like there's nobody there
So when it gets hard, don't be afraid
We don't care what them people say
I love it when you don't take no
I love it when you do what you want cause you just said so
Let them all go home, we out late

Hearts are gonna break
'Cause we don't have the time to be sorry
So baby be the life of the party

Pretending like there's no one else here that we know
Slow dance fall in love as the club track plays

// The Weight //

I wanna go back,
Forget that it's over
Paint it in black,
When you left me alone
I never knew,
She was sleeping next door with the kid I grew up with,
And I can't go back to her anymore, no

You tell me you were happier with him, you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
No, I can't lift the weight

Put you in the past,
Try to forget you 'cause it's over
And every time you ask
I'll pretend I'm okay
You're inside my head
In the middle of the night
When I don't feel right
I dream I can hold you,
And I can't go back to you anymore, yeah, yeah

You tell me you were happier with him, you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight

And I can't lift the weight, no, I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
And I can't lift the weight, no, I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
And I can't lift the weight, no, I can't lift the weight
Yeah, you lower your standards and I raise the stakes
And I can't lift the weight, no, I can't lift the weight

You tell me you were happier with him, but you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you, you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But I can't lift the weight, and I can't lift the weight

You tell me you were happier with him, but you want me to stay
You told me that you needed time but you, you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, you say someday you will change,
But I don't wanna wait

// Stitches //

I thought that I'd been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

Needle and the thread
Gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread
Gonna wind up dead

Needle and the thread
Gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread
Gonna wind up dead

Needle and the thread
Gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread
Gonna wind up dead

Needle and the thread
Gotta get you out of my head, get you out of my head

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees (falling on my knees)
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches (and I'll be needing stitches)
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help (begging, "Baby, please.")
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

(And now that)
I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
(And now that)
I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches

// Never Be Alone //

I promise that one day I'll be around
I'll keep you safe
I'll keep you sound

Right now it's pretty crazy
And I don't know how to stop or slow it down

Hey
I know there are some things we need to talk about

And I can't stay
Just let me hold you for a little longer now

Take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone

You'll never be alone
When you miss me close your eyes
I may be far but never gone

When you fall asleep tonight just remember that we lay under the same stars

And hey
I know there are some things we need to talk about

And I can't stay
Just let me hold you for a little longer now

And take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone

You'll never be alone, you'll never be alone
You'll never be alone, you'll never be alone

And take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone

// Kid In Love //

I know that we just met
Maybe this is dumb
But it feels like there was something
From the moment that we touched
'Cause it's alright, it's alright
I wanna make you mine

The way you're lightin' up the room
Caught the corner of my eye
We can both sneak out the back door
We don't have to say goodbye
'Cause it's alright, it's alright
To waste time tonight

Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
If this is what it's like falling in love
Then I don't ever wanna grow up
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
It'd be cool if it's the two of us
But I don't ever wanna grow up

'Cause I got it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And I got it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
But I don't ever wanna grow up

Said your place is kinda close
And your 'rents are out of town
Baby, there's no pressure
But if you're down, I'm down
'Cause it's alright, it's alright
To just talk tonight

If you're feeling kinda crazy
Turn down the lights
We can take our time
Do whatever you like
It's alright, it's alright
I wanna make you mine

Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
If this is what it's like falling in love
Then I don't ever wanna grow up
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
It'd be fine if it's the two of us
But I don't ever wanna grow up

[2x:]
'Cause I got it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And I got it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
But I don't ever wanna grow up

You make me feel like I got it all, yeah
And you make me feel
Like I'm just a kid in love
And you make me feel like I got it all
And you make me feel like I don't ever wanna grow up

Maybe we're just kids in love
Maybe we're just kids in love
Oh, baby
If this is what it's like falling in love
Then we don't ever have to grow up
Maybe we're just kids in love
Maybe we're just kids in love
Oh, baby
When we're alone and it's the two of us
I can't get enough

I've got it all, yeah
I've got it all, yeah
And I've got it, and I've got it all
And I've got it, and we've got it all
And I've got it, and I've got it all
But I don't ever wanna grow up

// I Don't Even Know Your Name //

Oh, you waited so long
Sometimes it's hard to stand out
And you don't have to do anything else
But be yourself
Oh, whoa, oh

You, you dressed up so nice
But all I could see was your eyes
And the crowd came and pulled you away
And then you were gone
Oh, whoa, yeah

And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me everyday
'Cause I don't even know your name

Oh, everywhere that I go
I see your face, and it kills me to know
That you'll never know what you did to me
And now you're gone
Yeah, I can't stop thinking 'bout you

'Cause I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me everyday
'Cause I don't even know your name

Yeah, I don't even know your name

I'm running, I'm searching
And I don't know where to start
I'm dying, my love, you punched a hole right through my heart
And I won't stop, stop looking
'Til I hold you in my arms
'Cause I'm running, I'm running, I'm running

I'm running, I'm searching
And I don't know where to start
I'm dying, my love, you punched a hole right through my heart
And I won't stop, stop looking
'Til I hold you in my arms
'Cause I'm running, I'm running, I'm running

And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me everyday
'Cause I don't even know your name.

// Something Big //

[Cute giggle] 1, 2, 3, 4

Oh, whoa, oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh

Play the lotto you might win it.
It's like 25 to life so you bust out of prison.

Something's in the air, something's in the air

It's like that feeling when you're just about to kill it,
Take your last shot you know you're gonna hit it.

Something's in the air, something's in the air

Whoa oh oh oh oh

Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling, and it's grabbing me,
Feel it in my bones like

Whoa oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh
Something big I feel it happening
Oh whoa oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Something big

It's like that feeling when you're 'bout to win the medal,
And you worked so hard that you knew you wouldn't settle,
Hands are in the air, hands are in the air.

When they hear you when you thought they wouldn't listen,
It's like an anthem that the whole world's singing,

Hands are in the air, hands are in the air.

Whoa oh oh oh oh

Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control,
Pushing, pulling, and it's grabbing me,
Feel it in my bones like,

Oh whoa oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa. Oh oh oh oh
Something big I feel it happening
Oh whoa oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh whoa. Oh oh oh oh
Something big

Whoa
Yeah, yeah

If we stomp our feet,
The ground will shake
If we clap our hands,
The walls will break
Yell so loud won't forget our names
'Cause something big is happening

Take this spark
And start a fire
Raise this up
We're feeling high
They can't tell us anything
'Cause something big is happening

Something big I feel it happening
Out of my control
Pushing, pulling, and it's grabbing me,
Feel it in my bones like

Oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Something big is happening whoa
Oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Something big I feel it happening oh

// Strings //

All the strings attached girl
All the strings attached girl, oh yeah...

Met this girl when I was three years old
We were holding hands tight so I'm told
And it felt like an eternity
Said it felt like an eternity
'Cause I knew back then we were more than friends
Two sided story it all depends
And I'll say it once and I'll say it again
It'll only end up hurting me

Years flew by I was less than twelve
Long division I need your help
Can you come on over and work with me
Anytime you like I'll make it work for me
'Cause I knew back when if we get too close
When the time is right maybe I propose
Baby climb on up, show me the ropes

Darling I want all the strings attached
I love it when you look at me like that
And you're the only girl that brings me back
'Cause baby I want all the strings attached
It's like always and forever
I won't let a moment pass
And when I'm with you I feel better
I want all the strings, all the strings attached

All the strings attached girl
All the strings attached girl, mmm yeah

So come on girl let me hold your hand
Let's go get lost, leave without a plan
And I know you got the world to see
But you know you mean the world to me
And I know right now you got second thoughts
Do whatever it takes, pay whatever the cost, yeah

You know me, not the type of guy
To stick around, to do the time
But you must have me hypnotized
I'm d-d-d-down to be by your side
Every night

Darling I want all the strings attached
I love it when you look at me like that
And you're the only girl that brings me back
'Cause baby I want all the strings attached
It's like always and forever
I won't let a moment pass
And when I'm with you I feel better
I want all the strings

And baby when you fall down, I'll fall too
And if you get lost, then I'll get lost with you
And when the waves crash down
Then baby I won't move
'Cause I need

All the strings attached
I love it when you look at me like that
And you're the only girl that brings me back
'Cause baby I want all the strings attached
It's like always and forever
I won't let a moment pass
And when I'm with you I feel better
I want all the strings
All the strings attached
I want all the strings
All the strings attached

All the strings attached girl
All the strings attached girl
Oh yeah

// Aftertaste //

Re-rewind Friday night
Never forget it
How you let me go
No more lies, I'll be fine
I know where I'm headed
Probably should've known

And now you're gonna say, "Pretty, please forgive me"
Fool me once, told you twice you're gonna regret it
Now you're all alone, yeah

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory
And the aftertaste

Close your eyes, you can't hide
Try to forget me
But I'm everywhere
I'm the smell on your sheets
You weren't ready
When you left me there

And now you're gonna say, "Pretty, please forgive me" Yeah
Bet it hurts, it gets worse
You know nobody said it would be fair, oh

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory
And the aftertaste

And now there's something in your way
'Cause you threw it all to waste
And you wonder if you could take back what you did that day
And it hurts, 'cause...

Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory
And the aftertaste

Truth is that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me
One more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory
And the aftertaste

And the aftertaste

// Air //

[Shawn:]
Never thought that we would end up here
Should've known it from the start
I know you mean it when you say you love me
But we're trying way too hard

[Astrid:]
Used to think that we would last forever
How could I've been so wrong?
Never thought I'd be the one to say this
What if our time has come and gone?

[Both:]
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringin' me along
And I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me
This time I'm coming up for air

Air [12x]

[Astrid:]
Always tryna put your two cents in
Then expecting me to change
Tried to fix me up but I'm not broken
All you do is leave me stained

[Shawn:]
Told you not to tie me down too quickly
Take it slow, it's not a race
And you keep on tryna reel me in, but
All I really need is space

[Both:]
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringin' me along
And I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me
This time I'm coming up for air

Air [12x]
Air [12x]

[Shawn:]
Trying to hold me down
But I'm surfacing
It's hard to let you go
But I gotta leave

[Both:]
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringin' me along
And I don't have the time to spare
[Shawn:]
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me
I'm coming up for air

[Both:]
You, you don't mean no harm
But you're stringin' me along
And I don't have the time to spare
And I, I'm trying hard to breathe
But you're suffocating me
This time I'm coming up for air

Air [12x]
Air [12x]

// Crazy //

Think I don't need a watch to tell the time
Think I don't need the sun to help me shine
Think I don't need a girl to be alright
Guess I didn't know

Thought I didn't need shoes on my feet
Thought I didn't need a bed to fall asleep
Thought I didn't need love to be complete
Guess I didn't know

That I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me, for me

You're all I think about when I'm awake
Part of every night and every day
And everything's a mess when you're away
Now I know

All of this is getting really old
I'm having trouble sleeping on my own
Feeling like a house but not a home
I want you to know

That I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me, for me

Guess I need a watch to tell the time
Guess I need the sun to help me shine
And I really need you in my life
Now I know

That you give me this crazy feeling
And you won't have to wait no more for me, for me
And I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me

// A Little Too Much //

She would not show that she was afraid
But being and feeling alone was too much to face
Though everyone said that she was so strong
What they didn't know is that she could barely carry on

But she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way

Sometimes it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

She would always tell herself she could do this
She would use no help it would be just fine
But when it got hard she would lose her focus
So take my hand and we'll be alright

And she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way

Sometimes it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much, yeah

A little too much, I said a little too much, oh

Sometimes it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much yeah

Sometimes it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

// This Is What It Takes //

I watch your troubled eyes as you rest
And I fall in love with every breath
Wonder if those eyes are really shut
And am I the one you're dreaming of?

'Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this 'cause I've noticed
A little bit shining through the seams

And if this is what it takes
Then let me be the one to bear the pain
Ooh if this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way
If this is what it takes

You keep on telling me I'm wasting time
But to call it wasting time, oh, that's a crime
And you think it's crazy what I'm tryna do
Well baby, I'm a fool for you

'Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this 'cause I've noticed
A little bit shining through the seams, yeah

And if this is what it takes
Then let me be the one to bear the pain
Ooh if this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way

'Cause if you don't understand yet
Then I'll never let you forget
That you don't have to do this on your own

I'll be your shoulder to lean on
I'll be your right when you feel wrong
So come on, take my hand, we're moving on

And if this is what it takes
Then let me be the one to bear the pain
Ooh and if this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls
These walls that are in our way
If this is what it takes

// Bring It Back //

Takin' it slow
Isn't easy
If as far as you go
Is only half as far as you and I both know
Yeah

Comin' out from above
A little something
And it's only because
I don't ever wanna see you in love
But I know

That you've been coming off strong lately
And I can feel it that
You've been thinking that maybe
You got a—another shot at me
Thinking possibly
Somehow, but not now

And it's been spinning around like a hurricane
And the sound of the thunder
That's beatin' my head to the ground
But I
I know

That I can't go back
To this
To her
To what we used to have

It's black and burnt
My God, this is so sad
It'll only make things worse
If we bring it back

Whoa, yeah, yeah, mmm, whoa, oh

And I mean if you believe
That there is something still between you and me
Then, baby, honestly, yeah
You're not the one for me

And I can't go back
To this
To her
To what we used to have

It's black and burnt
My God, this is so sad
It'll only make things worse
If we bring it back

If we bring it back [4x]

// Imagination //

Oh, there she goes again
Every morning it's the same
You walk on by my house
I wanna call out your name

I wanna tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standing
You got me thinking what we could be 'cause...

I keep craving, craving
You don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love
Can't wait anymore, I won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

In my dreams you're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there—who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?

We walk, we laugh, we spend our time
Walking by the ocean side
Our hands are gently intertwined
A feeling I just can't describe
All this time we spent alone
Thinking we could not belong
To something so damn beautiful
So damn beautiful

I keep craving, craving, you don't know it, but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love
Can't wait anymore, I won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

In my dreams you're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there—who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Imagination
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Imagination
Whoa, whoa, whoa

In my dreams you're with me
We'll be everything I want us to be
And from there—who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?

I keep craving, craving
You don't know it, but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you

// Don't Want Your Love //

We run about a million miles an hour
And I do my best to try to do it in style
Haven't seen you in a while, girl
Our love is on trial (you run wild, you run wild)
When I call you, you never wanna pick up
'Cause everything that I do is never ever enough
You only like it when it rains
And when I'm stuck in the mud (you run wild, you run wild, yeah)

Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor
You mess me up, and still I come back for more
Don't want your love

I'm not asking for much, I'm just tryna be fair
This road we're on is going nowhere
If we keep on running like a couple of kids
Who just get lost in the woods and now they're losing their wits
I'm overcome with it, this is ridiculous
How every time we get together, you're the one I miss
I feel powerless and I don't want to split
You run wild, you run wild

Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor
You mess me up, and still I come back for more
Don't want your love, yeah, whoa

That's it it's now or never
I can't do this forever
'Cause all this stormy weather's got me running wild
That's it it's now or never
I can't do this forever
'Cause all this stormy weather's got me running wild

[2x]
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor
You mess me up, and still I come back for more
Don't want your love

// Lost //

I walk down the street and all I can see
Is people taking pictures of what they're 'bout to eat
Did you even notice the girl sitting across from you?
I sit in your room with nothing to do
Victim to the screen between me and you
Guess there's somebody else that you'd rather be talking to

Hold on, time out, help me

Cause right now I wanna get lost in this moment
Keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this connection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost, and I wanna get lost

We go out to shows but why do we go
If we're only gonna see it through the screen on our phones?
If we're all here together then why are we watching alone?
The world's so much bigger than posing for pictures
If all that we need's at the tips of our fingers
Then how did this happen that we all fell so out of touch?

Hold on, time out, help me

Cause right now I wanna get lost in this moment
Keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this connection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost

Tell me how it feels cause I know the hardest part
Is when you're holding something real, you can see it in the dark
I'll tell you how it feels and here's the hardest part
If you wanna reach for something real, you gotta see it in the dark

I wanna get lost in this moment
Keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this connection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else

I wanna get lost, I wanna get lost, and I wanna get lost

// I Know What You Did Last Summer //

[Shawn & Camila:]
Ah
Hey-ey
Ah, ah
Ah
Hey-ey
Ah, ah

[Camila:]
He knows
Dirty secrets that I keep
Does he know it's killing me?
He knows, he knows
D-d-does he know
Another's hands have touched my skin
I won't tell him where I've been
He knows, he knows, he knows

[Shawn (Camila):]
It's tearing me apart
She's slipping away (I'm slipping away)
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
The pictures on her phone (the pictures on my phone)
She's not coming home (I'm not coming home)
(Coming home, coming home)

[Shawn (Camila):]
I know what you did last summer (ah-ah)
Just lie to me there's no other (he-ey)
I know what you did last summer

I didn't mean it, mean it, no
[Shawn:]
Can't seem to let you go
Can't seem to hold you close
I know

[Shawn:]
When she looks me in the eyes
They don't seem as bright
No more, no more, I know
That she loved me at one time
Would I promise her that night
Cross my heart and hope to die

[Shawn (Camila):]
It's tearing me apart (it's tearing me apart)
And she's slipping away (I'm slipping away)
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
The pictures on her phone (the pictures on my phone)
And she's not coming home (I'm not coming home)
Oh, na, na, na, oh, yeah

// Act Like You Love Me //

So you leave tomorrow
Just sleep the night
I promise I will, make things right
I'll make you breakfast, the way you like
Before you leave tomorrow
Just let me try

Before you leave tomorrow
Before you say goodbye
Before you leave tomorrow
Before you leave 

Stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment, before you're gone
And I, am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me, so I can go on
And act like you love me, so I can go on

Just one more night
Lying in bed
Whether it's wrong or right
Just gotta make sense of it
And you'll be gone in the morning
And you'll be over this
Just one more night, so I can forget

Stay here and lay here
Right in my arms
It's only a moment, before you're gone
And I, am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me, so I can go on

When you go, I can't watch you leave
Just promise me you'll sneak out when I'm asleep
And when you go, and you're miles down the road
I wake up wishing everything was just a dream

Just stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I, am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me, so I can go on

And stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment, before you're gone
And I, am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me, so I can go on
And act like you love me, so I can go on
Just act like you love me, so I can go on

// Running Low //

Weeks on end, I'm on the road
I start to lose my sense of home
I should've called so many times but I,
I just sat next to my phone

Just know it takes it from me
To end this darling, oh

And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry but I have to go

Oh oh
Oh oh

Thinking back to every night
That we just laid there for a while
And when I looked into your eyes oh
I never thought I'd say goodbye

Just know it takes it from me
To end this darling, oh yeah

And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry but I have to go

Just needed time to, to find my own
But I promise someone will give you all you want
Can give you all you need
And you just gotta see
I never meant to hurt you, no

And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm sorry but I have to go

// Memories //

When I wake up to your footsteps
As you get up out of bed
They make a song that sounds so simple
But it dances in my head
A melody so perfect
That it gets me through the day
And the thought of us forever
Is one that won't ever go away

All I need to know is
Where to start
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go

So let's hold on together
To this paper and this pen
And write down every letter
To every word we've ever said

All I need to know is
Where to start
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go

Let's write our story
And let's sing our song
Let's hang our pictures on the wall
All these precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all

Memories after all
Memories after all

You know, you gave me hope
But I've got to let go
I've got to let go

It's taking its toll
Deep in my soul
Now I've got to let go

We wrote our story
And we sang our songs
We hung our pictures on the wall

Now those precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all
