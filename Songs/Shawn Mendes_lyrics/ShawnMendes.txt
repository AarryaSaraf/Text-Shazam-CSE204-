// Show You //

You can't walk the streets at night
You're way too short to get on this ride
No I'm not, no I'm not, they're tryna tell me that I
I gotta be home when the street lights glow?
You can't watch your TV show
I will watch what I wanna watch
No, won't listen to you, do what I wanna do

And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you

Watch me swim across this lake
Fly through the sky in my Superman cape
Watch me walk across this wire
Tip-toe through the coals of a blazing fire
Watch me fly this kite in the rain
I'll jump rope with my ball and chain
Come by and knock on my house of cards
If it falls I'll rebuild it from the start
I won't listen to you, do what I wanna do

And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you

Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out
If you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
I don't know what you heard about, listen to me yell it loud
Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, really, gotta show you now?

Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out
If you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
I don't know what you heard about, see that door I'll knock it down

And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you

Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out
If you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
Do I need to show you? Guess I gotta show you

// One Of Those Nights //

Time warp in the middle of a daydream
Call you up 'cause the time needs wasting
Last drive, we got nowhere to go
Fear not, yeah, welcome to the jungle
Think fast, move quick, don't stumble
We can't do this alone

Where do we go? We don't know
Follow the wind where it blows
Let's make mistakes and don't look back, it's now or never

One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full,
One of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours,
One of those nights

We're young, living with no fear
Kids running wild, girls crying drunk tears
We don't have this time for long
Yeah, we make big plans, spending all our change
Caught up in the night, oh we missed the last train
It's our time and we're leaving home

Where do we go? We don't know
Follow the wind where it blows
Let's make mistakes and don't look back, it's now or never

One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full,
One of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours,
One of those nights

[2x]
I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don't wanna miss
Time of our lives,
One of those nights

Go home it's over, but it's not the end
Don't wait 'til you're older to begin
Keep your composure and innocence

Where do we go? We don't know

One of those nights, we're driving around
In this boring ass town
One of those nights

I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don't wanna miss
Time of our lives,
One of those nights

One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full,
One of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours,
One of those nights

I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don't wanna miss
Time of our lives,
One of those nights

One of those nights, where she turns the lights down
And it's only us now,
One of those nights

// In My Blood //

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

It isn't in my blood

I'm looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could...

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

It isn't in my blood

I need somebody now
I need somebody now
Someone to help me out
I need somebody now

Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood

// Nervous //

I saw you on a Sunday in a cafe
And all you did was look my way
And my heart started to race
And my hands started to shake, yeah
I heard you asked about me through a friend
And my adrenaline kicked in
'Cause I've been askin' 'bout you too
And now we're right here in this room

I get a little bit nervous around you
Get a little bit stressed out when I think about you

But I like what you're doing to me
Ah, what you're doing to me

// Lost In Japan //

All it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see ya
All I gotta ask

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind (oh)

Yeah, I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you thinking 'bout it, yeah
Do I gotta convince you
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind

Do you got plans tonight?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind

Let's get lost tonight
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind

Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind

// Where Were You In The Morning? //

You said, "I wanna get to know ya"
Why you gotta get my hopes up?
You said that you were staying over
But then I woke up to the cold air

How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waiting
Where were you in the morning, baby?

How do you, how do you just walk away?
How do you, how do you just walk away?

And I thought you really felt this
When we were talking about breakfast
You made it seem like we connected
I guess I just didn't expect this

How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waiting
I said where were you in the morning, baby?

How do you, how do you just walk away?
(Where were, where were you?)
How do you, how do you just walk away?
(Where were, where were you?)

And I hope you had a good reason
'Cause I know you had a good time
And I'm looking up at the ceiling
And I keep wondering why

Where were you in the morning, baby?
(Where were you in the morning?)
You didn't leave your number for me
(You didn't leave your number)
Left me without a warning, waiting
(Left me without a warning)
I said, where were you in the morning baby?
(Where were you in the morning?)

How do you, how do you just walk away?
(Where were, where were you?)
How do you, how do you just walk away?
(Where were, where were you?)
How do you, how do you just walk away?
(Where were, where were you?)
How do you, how do you just walk away?
(Where were, where were you?)

// Like To Be You //

Don't cry or do whatever makes you comfortable
I'm tired too, there's nothin' left to say
Let's call a truce, 'cause I don't really wanna go to
Bed like this

I'm so sorry
That we're still stuck in the middle
I'm so sorry
'Cause in the moment I

I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like but I'm dying to
If I could put myself in your shoes
Then I'd know what it's like to be you

Can I kiss you or not?
'Cause I'm not really sure I know of what you want
Are you still mad at me? I'm hopin' not
'Cause maybe we could go to the movies
I know that always cheers us up, hey

I'm so sorry
That we're still stuck in the middle
Yeah, I'm so sorry
'Cause in the moment I

I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like but I'm dying to
If I could put myself in your shoes
Then I'd know what it's like to be you

Tell me what's inside of your head
No matter what you say I won't love you less
And I'd be lying if I said that I do
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like to be you

I get worried
I might lose you a little
Every time we
Every time we argue and get caught up in the moment

I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like but I'm dying to
If I could put myself in your shoes
Then I'd know what it's like to be you

So tell me what's inside of your head
No matter what you say I won't love you less
And I'd be lying if I said that I do
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like

// Fallin' All In You //

Sunrise with you on my chest
No blinds in the place where I live
Daybreak open your eyes
'Cause this was only ever meant to be for one night
Still, we're changing our minds here
Be yours, be my dear
So close with you on my lips
Touch noses, feeling your breath
Push your heart and pull away, yeah
Be my summer in a winter day love
I can't see one thing wrong
Between the both of us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

You are bringing out a different kind of me
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Falling all in you
Fell for men who weren't how they appear
Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here
We're free
Falling all in you

Fast forward a couple years, yeah
Grown up in the place that we live
Make love, then we fight
Laugh 'cause it was only meant to be for one night baby
I guess we can't control
What's just not up to us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

You are bringing out a different kind of me
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Falling all in you
Fell for men who weren't how they appear
Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here
We're free
Falling all in you

Every time I see you baby I get lost
If I'm dreaming, baby, please don't wake me up
Every night I'm with you I fall more in love
Now I'm laying by your side
Everything feels right since you came along
I'm thinking baby

You, yeah, are bringing out a different kind of me
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Falling all in you
Fell for men who weren't how they appear (Ooh)
Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here
We're free
Falling all in

// Particular Taste //

She don't listen to a thing, 'less it feels right
Only dances when it's Kanye
She can take you one on one if she feels like
You'll be begging her for mercy, mercy

Oooh, she'll take your name and number
Then she'll hit erase and walk away
But oooh, she's so specific when she's at my place
At my place

She's got particular taste, yeah
She's so obsessed with the chase, yeah
She don't waste time on conversations, no
She just goes right for the face, yeah
She's so particular

Never pickin' up her phone 'less it rings twice
Only answers with a question, "Mhm?"
If I try to play it cool, it never goes right
Got me drownin', drownin', ah

Oooh, she'll take your name and number
Then she'll hit erase and walk away
But oooh, she's so specific when she's at my place

She's so particular

I'm so obsessed with her, yeah
She's so particular
I'm so obsessed with her, yeah
She's so particular

She's the best at getcha' thinkin' that she don't care
Knows exactly what she wants, uh
Now she's runnin' all her fingers right through my hair
And it means that

She's got particular taste, yeah
(She's got particular taste)
She's so obsessed with the chase, yeah
She don't waste time on conversations, no

// Why //

I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to her, and I know

When people ask about us, now, we just brush it off
I don't know why we act like it means nothing at all
I wish that I could tell you that you're all that I want, yeah

I pretend that I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say hi like you just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

When I hear you sing, it gets hard to breathe
Can't help but think every song's about me
And every line, every word that I write
You are the muse in the back of my mind, oh

Don't want to ask about it 'cause you might brush it off
I'm afraid you think that it means nothing at all
I don't know why I won't admit that you're all I want

I pretend that I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say hi like you just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

I pretend that I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say hi like you just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to you

// Because I Had You //

I think it's time that I be honest
Should've told you not to go
Thought I knew just what I wanted
I didn't know myself at all

You're with somebody I can't be, yeah
But I can tell that you're happy

It's time for me to finally meet somebody new
Take her to all the places that I took us too
And she might help me forget
But loving her is something I could never do
Because I had, because I had you

Hey, remember when I told you
That you and I will go down in history together, yeah
And does your sister ask about me?
And you and I, what we had, is it gone forever?

You're with somebody I can't be
But I can tell that you're happy

It's time for me to finally meet somebody new
Take her to all the places that I took us too
And she might help me forget
But loving her is something I could never do
Because I had, because I had you

There's nothin', oh
There's nothin' left to lose
Because I had you, babe
There's nothin'
Nothin' that I could do
I wish I had you

But I think it's time I finally found somebody new
And tell myself that she's the one that get me through
And she might help me forget
But loving her is something I just couldn't do
Because I had you

// Queen //

It's hard to believe you don't remember me at all
Am I hard to recognize?
You say "Nice to meet you" every time, yeah
And I made you laugh, I still remember what I said
Guess I shouldn't be surprised
You say "Nice to meet you" every time

I know we got a lot of mutual friends
Don't say my name, don't come up in your conversations, yeah

Who crowned you
Queen of "You think you're too cool"
Making beautiful look ugly
The way you put yourself above me
You treat me
Like I got nothing on you
Making beautiful look ugly
You ain't the ruler of no country
Who made you the queen?

I shouldn't stress about the fact you're not impressed
Are you playing hard to get
Or maybe you're not interested
I don't understand why everybody thinks you're sweet
'Cause I see the opposite
No, you're not so innocent

I see the way you're lookin' through me right now
To see if there's somebody cooler around, yeah

Who crowned you
Queen of "You think you're too cool"
Making beautiful look ugly
The way you put yourself above me
You treat me
Like I got nothing on you
Making beautiful look ugly
You ain't the ruler of no country
Who made you the queen?

No no no no no
Who made you the queen?
Who made you the queen?

Who crowned you
Queen of "You think you're too cool"
Making beautiful look ugly
The way you put yourself above me
Yeah... naaah, yeah
You treat me
Like I got nothing on you
Making beautiful look ugly
You ain't the ruler of no country
Who made you the queen?
Who made you the queen?
Yeah, you think you're too cool, nah
Who made you the queen?
Who made you the queen?

// Youth //

Here I am, stuck on this couch
Scrolling through my notes
Heart was broken, still not growing, nah

Waking up to headlines
Filled with devastation again
My heart is broken
But I keep going

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
Now, I know it
Yeah, I know it

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away

It's hard to sleep at night
Knowing what's outside
Feeling hopeless
I need focus

You hit me with words 
I never heard come out your mouth
To be honest
I don't want it, no

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away (youth away)

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away

// Mutual //

I want you close to me
I want you close, I want you closer
But when you're here with me
It's hard to tell just what you're after

You say, you want all of me today
But tomorrow's not the same
My feelings never change
What do you want from me?
What do you want?

I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me

This inconsistency
What does it mean? You got me questioning
The way you act and take it back, do I mean anything?
Just tell me honestly

You say, you want all of me today
But tomorrow's not the same
My feelings never change
What do you want from me?
What do you want?

I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me

Are you playing me?
Is this a game?
When you show up late
Say love at 2 am
Then tell me you can't stay, girl, yeah
What do you want from me?

Baby oh, I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad, baby
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me

// Perfectly Wrong //

Taste the poison from your lips
Lately, we're as good as gone
Oh, our love is drunk and it's
Singing me my favorite song

Me and you, we were made to break
I know that's true, but it's much too late

You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
You're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky could see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

Oh, you know how much it hurts
Every time you say you hate me
But when we're making love, you make it worth it
I can't believe the places that you take me

There's no use, we were made to break
I know the truth, and it's much too late

You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky could see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

Oh, and why can't I quit
When you break my heart open
I need you more than I know
Oh, and I can't resist
When you're up against my skin
I never want to let you go

You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, mhm
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Hate that you know that I won't leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, oh

Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, yeah
Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me
Hate that you know that I won't leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me

// When You're Ready //

Maybe I had too many drinks, but that's just what I needed
I hope that you don't think that what I'm saying sounds conceited
When I look across the room, you're staring right back at me
Like somebody told a joke and we're the only ones laughin'

Don't know why I try 'cause ain't nobody like you
Familiar disappointment every single time I do
Every single night my arms are not around you
My mind's still wrapped around you

Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, any time you're ready
I'm waitin'
Even ten years from now
If you haven't found somebody
I promise, I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'

What if my dad is right when he says that you're the one
No, I can't even argue, I won't even fight him on it
I call you when it's late and I know that you're in bed
'Cause I'm three hours back, seems like you're always six ahead

I don't know why I try 'cause ain't nobody like you
Familiar disappointment every single time I do
And every single night my arms are not around you
My mind's still wrapped around you

Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, any time you're ready
I'm waitin'
Even ten years from now
If you haven't found somebody
I promise, I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah

And if I have to, I'll wait forever
Say the word and I'll change my plans
Yeah, you know that we fit together
I know your heart like the back of my hand

So baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, any time you're ready
I'm waitin'
Even ten years from now
If you haven't found somebody
I promise, I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah

Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, any time you're ready
I'm waitin', oh
Even ten years from now
If you haven't found somebody
I promise, I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', I'm waitin'

// Señorita //

I love it when you call me SeÃ±orita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya

Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la
Yeah, no

Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila Sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la
Yeah

I love it when you call me SeÃ±orita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it

When you call me SeÃ±orita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya

Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say, "We're just friends."
But friends don't know the way you taste-la-la-la
'Cause you know it's been a long time comin'
Don't you let me fall, oh

Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop

I love it when you call me SeÃ±orita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it

When you call me SeÃ±orita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true la-la-la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya

All along I'll be coming for ya (for ya)
And I hope it meant something to ya
Call my name, I'll be comin' for ya (comin' for ya)
Comin' for ya (comin' for ya)

For ya, for ya (oh, she loves it when I call her), for ya
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming
For ya

// If I Can't Have You //

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room (Yeah)
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you

Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know, that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

I'm so sorry that my timing's off
But I can't move on if we're still gonna talk
Is it wrong for me to not want half
I want all of you, all the strings attached

Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know, that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

I'm trying, to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing, everything means nothing, babe
I'm trying, to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing if I can't have you

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
