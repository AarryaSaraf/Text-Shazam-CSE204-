// Where Were You In The Morning? (Kaytranada Remix) //

You said, "I wanna get to know ya"
Why you gotta get my hopes up?
You said that you were staying over
But then I woke up to the cold air

How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

Where were you in the morning, baby? (Baby?)
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin' (waitin')
Where were you in the morning, baby?

How do you, how do you just walk away? (Away)
How do you, how do you just walk away? (Walk away)

And I thought you really felt this
When we were talking about breakfast
You made it seem like we connected
I guess I just didn't expect this

How could you make me believe? (Believe)
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

Where were you in the morning, baby? (Baby?)
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
I said where were you in the morning, baby?

How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?

And I hope you had a good reason
'Cause I know you had a good time
And I'm looking up at the ceiling
And I keep wondering why (why)

Where were you in the morning, baby?
Where were you in the morning?
You didn't leave your number for me
You didn't leave your number
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Left me without a warning
I said, where were you in the morning baby?
Where were you in the morning?

How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away? (Walk away)
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away? (Walk away)
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?

How? Woo

// Why (Remix) //

[Shawn Mendes:]
I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to her, and I know

When people ask about us, now, we just brush it off
I don't know why we act like it means nothing at all
I wish that I could tell you that you're all that I want, yeah

I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

[Leon Bridges:]
When I hear you sing, it gets hard to breathe
Can't help but think every song's about me
And every line, every word that I write
You are the muse in the back of my mind, oh

[Shawn Mendes & Leon Bridges:]
Don't wanna ask about it 'cause you might brush it off
I'm afraid you think that it means nothing at all
I don't know why I won't admit that you're all I want

I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

I pretend that (pretending like I'm not)
I'm not ready (I'm pretending like I mean)
Why do we put each other through hell? (Yeah, yeah)
Why can't we just get over ourselves? (Why, why, why)
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

[Shawn Mendes:]
I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to you

// Youth (Remix) //

[Khalid & Jessie Reyez:]
Here I am, stuck on this couch scrolling through my notes
Heart was broken, still not growing, nah
Why is it always televised, they want me desensitized
I won't do it, I won't do it, mhm

[Shawn Mendes, Khalid & Jessie Reyez:]
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
Now, I know it, yeah, I know it

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away

It's hard to sleep at night, knowing what's outside
Feeling hopeless, I need focus
You have died inside, and your soul's not worth the price
Don't you lose it, for this foolishness, no
You hit me with words I never heard come out your mouth
To be honest, I don't want it, no

Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away

You can't take my youth away (can't take my youth)
You can't take my youth away
Oh, yeah

How come certain boys in blue
Can be so quick to shoot
You gotta be the change that you want to see
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
You gotta be the heaven you want to see
No, I won't let it change me (ooh)

You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away (youth away)
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away (oh yeah)
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today (oh, oh)
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
