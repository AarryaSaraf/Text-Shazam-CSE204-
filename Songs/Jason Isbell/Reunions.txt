// What've I Done To Help //

What've I done to help?
What've I done to help? Somebody save me
What've I done to help?
What've I done to help but not myself?

What've I done to help?
What've I done to help? Somebody save me
What've I done to help?
What've I done to help but not myself?

Thought I was alone in the world
Until my memories gathered 'round me in the night
Thought I was strong
Until I finally had to fight

I kept my head down
And showed up to work on time and watched my appetite
Put the money in the mattress
Lock the doors at night, and we'd all be alright

What've I done to help?
What've I done to help? Somebody save me
What've I done to help?
What've I done to help but not myself?

What've I done to help?
What've I done to help? Somebody save me
What've I done to help?
What've I done to help but not myself?

See I've made mistakes that I can't erase
Some of the love I've lost will not come back to me
I broke my word, I lied on a Bible
Just to feel a little free

She didn't deserve it; nobody ever deserves it
But I cut anchor and I drifted out to sea
And you found me busted and somehow you trusted
I was not what I could be

What've I done to help?
What've I done to help? Somebody save me
What've I done to help?
What've I done to help but not myself?

What've I done to help?
What've I done to help? Somebody save me
What've I done to help?
What've I done to help but not myself?

Climb to safety, you and me and the baby
Send our thoughts and prayers to loved ones on the ground
And as the days went by
We just stopped looking down, down, down

The world's on fire and we just climb higher
Till we're no longer bothered by the smoke and sound
Good people suffer and the heart gets tougher
Nothing given, nothing found

What've I done to help?
What've I done to help? Somebody save me
What've I done to help?
What've I done to help but not myself?

What've I done to help?
What've I done to help? Somebody save me
What've I done to help?
What've I done to help but not myself?

What've I done to help?
What've I done to help? Somebody save me
What've I done to help?
What've I done to help but not myself?

What've I done to help?
What've I done to help? Somebody save me
What've I done to help?
What've I done to help but not myself?

What've I done to help?
What've I done to help? Somebody save me (somebody save me)
What've I done to help?
What've I done to help but not myself?

What've I done to help?
What've I done to help? Somebody save me (somebody)
What've I done to help?
What've I done to help but not myself?

What've I done to help? (what have I done)
What've I done to help? Somebody save me (somebody)
What've I done to help?
What've I done to help but not myself?

What've I done to help?
What've I done to help? Somebody save me
Oh, what've I done to help?
What've I done to help but not myself?

// Dreamsicle //

I guess we're leaving town again
We're moving out and moving in
Gotta break the news to all my friends
But they won't care

They'll just find another face
To fall behind, to take my place
To run way out past second base
And just stand there

A dreamsicle on a summer night
In a folding lawn chair
Witches ring around the moon
Better get home soon

Poison oak to poison ivy
Dirty jokes that blew right by me
Mama curling up beside me
Crying to herself

Why can't Daddy just come home?
Forget whatever he did wrong
He's in a hotel all alone
And we need help

A dreamsicle on a summer night
In a folding lawn chair
I'm still packing up my room
Gotta get home soon

New sneakers on a high school court
And you swore you'd be there
My heart breaking through the springtime
Breaking in June

Broken glass and broken vows
I'll be 18 four years from now
With different friends in a different town
I'll finally be free

Call you both some holiday
Tell you why I moved away
Say, "Everything's gonna be okay
You can come see me."

A dreamsicle on a summer night
In a folding lawn chair
Daddy's howling at the moon
Better get home soon

Heat lightning in the evening sky
And my mama's red hair
Hearts breaking through the springtime
Breaking in June

Breaking in June
Breaking in June

// Only Children //

Walking around at night
Fighting my appetite
Every kid in cut-offs could be you

Remember when we used to meet
At the bottom of Mobile Street
Do what the broken people do

Are you still taking notes?
The Holy Ghost could get inside you
You do whatever you put your mind to
Will you read me what you wrote?
When we were locked outside the building
Over-encouraged only children

Cold coffee on the fire escape
We bet it all on a demo tape
When we still had something left to steal

Remember when we took too much
To get a little of the human touch
Hand to mouth and reel to reel

And are you still taking notes?
Hydrocodone in your backpack
Maybe these words will hold the beast back
Will you read me what you wrote?
The one I said you stole from Dylan
Over-encouraged only children

"Heaven's wasted on the dead"
That's what your mama said
And the hearse was idling in the parking lot
She said you thought the world of me
And you were glad to see
They finally let me be an astronaut

Are you still taking notes?
Do you have anyone to talk to?
Castle walls that you can walk through?
Do the dead believe in ghosts?
Or are you lost in some old building
With over-encouraged only children?

// Overseas //

Used to be a ghost town
But even the ghosts got out
And the sound of the highway died
There's ashes in the swimming pool

And I saw you on your wedding night
And I watched you sleeping in my arms
You didn't wash you make-up off
Woke up looking scared as hell

My love won't change
My love won't change
My love won't change a thing
You're never coming back to me
You're never coming back at all

And the waiter made a young girl cry
At the table next to mine last night
And I know you would have brought him to his knees
But you're overseas

Doesn't seem so long ago we thought that we could change their minds
Stay here and fight it out
A love that we could weaponize

But I saw you losing faith and I was watching when the light went out
Know what revolution means
Know it's not an option now

My love won't change
My love won't change
Our love won't change a thing
I couldn't leave my father here
To finish up his life alone

And I saw you in our daughters eyes last night
When she caught me in a lie
And I need you here to make both of us believe
But you're overseas

Does your heart rest easy where you are?
And do they treat you like a star?
And do they call you refugee?
From overseas

// Running With Our Eyes Closed //

Took forever to get you to trust me
Like I was feeding a bird from my hand
And if this isn't love than it must be
Another answer I don't understand

To a prayer that was please and not thank you
To a question I wrote in the sand
To a wish that I made on a satellite
From a witness in tears on the stand

Running with our eyes closed
Running with our eyes closed

Well, you are who you are when you're angry
When you're scared or you're sad or you're bored
When a stranger has slipped you a room key
To a hotel room you couldn't afford

We can never go back and be strangers
All our secrets are mixed and distilled
But you've taught me to temper my anger
And you've learned it's alright to be still

Running with our eyes closed
We're running with our eyes closed
Running with our eyes closed
We're running with our eyes closed

Sleeping on my own when you won't forgive me
Swallowing my pride till I nearly choke
Screaming at the phone when you don't believe me
And laughing at that joke

We're running with our eyes closed
Running with our eyes closed
Running with our eyes closed
Running with our eyes closed

// River //

The river is my savior
Because she used to be a cloud
She's happy just to lay there
When she used to be so proud

And even when she dries up
A thousand years from now
I'll lay myself beside her
And call her name out loud

The river is my savior
The only one I'll ever need
Wash my head when I've been sinning
Wash my knuckles when they bleed

Protect me from my neighbor
All this jealousy and greed
Take the body to the delta
Hide the weapon in the weeds

But now I'm tired and a little bit confused
Regarding what I meant to do and what I did
The men I've hired, they all seem to be afraid of me
They turn their eyes away from me like kids

The river hears my secrets
Things I cannot tell a soul
Like the children that I've orphaned
And the fortune that I stole

The neighbor who asked questions
Till he washed up on the shoal
But I've done the law some favors
So nobody has to know

Now I'm tired and I just can't get to sleep
I've been a wolf among these sheep for all my life
The lake of fire it consumes me in my dreams
And last night I woke up screaming at my wife

The river is my savior
She's running to the sea
And to reach her destination
Is to simply cease to be

And running till you're nothing
Sounds a lot like being free
So I'll lay myself inside her
And I'll let her carry me

// Be Afraid //

We've been testing you
And you failed
To see how long that you could sit with the truth but you bailed

I don't think you'd even recognize the loss of control
And I don't think you even see it in yourself
See every one of us is counting dice that we didn't roll
And the loser is the last to ask for help

Be afraid, be very afraid
But do it anyway
Do it anyway

The stage belongs to you
And you feel like a star
And you can bark and snap like a dog at the man who just tuned your guitar
And I don't think you'd even recognize a kid in the wings
And I don't think you even see her in yourself
She looks to you for what to do with all her delicate dreams
But you're too terrified to be of any help

Be afraid, be very afraid
But do it anyway
Do it anyway

Be afraid, be very afraid
But do it anyway
Do it anyway

We don't take requests
We won't shut up and sing
Tell the truth enough you'll find it rhymes with everything

We've been testing you
And you failed
To see how long that you could hold it in before you screamed
But you only exhaled
And I don't think you even recognize the sound of your voice
When it's blasting through the speakers in the sky
And if your words add up to nothing 
Then you're making a choice to sing a cover when you need a battle cry

Be afraid, be very afraid
But do it anyway
Do it anyway

Be afraid, be very afraid
But do it anyway
Do it anyway

Be afraid, be very afraid
But do it anyway
Do it anyway

// St. Peter's Autograph //

What do I do to make you smile?
You been hurting for a while
What can I do to make you laugh?
Get St. Peter's autograph?

What's that distance in your eyes?
Has your faith been compromised?
What can I do to help you sleep?
I'll work hard and work for cheap

Sometimes it's nothing but the way you're wired
And that's not your fault
We're all struggling with the world on fire
And the fear we're taught

Now you've lost another friend
Who couldn't stay to see the end
He had somewhere else to be
Cut him down and burn the tree

There's no shelter from the rain
And I can't comprehend your pain
But I got arms and I got ears
And I will always be right here

Sometimes its nothing but the way you're raised
And that could have been worse
And I see you suffering through the best of days
Still you're putting me first

What do I do to let you know
That I'm not haunted by his ghost?
Let him dance around our room
Let him smell of your perfume

Share your best remember whens
If he comes through here again
Maybe he could make you laugh
Bring St. Peter's autograph

// It Gets Easier //

Last night I dreamed that I'd been drinking
Same dream I have 'bout twice a week
I had one glass of wine
I woke up feeling fine
And that's how I knew it was a dream

Last night I dreamed that I'd been drinking
Cold burn of whiskey down my throat
My hand turned into a rattlesnake
And I laughed myself awake
And that's how I knew it was a joke

It gets easier but it never gets easy
I can say it's all worth it, but you won't believe me
Hold down your liquor or swallow your pride
You'd rather keep it inside
It gets easier but it never gets easy

Last night I did myself a favor
I called in sick and went downtown
Drove past the local bar
A cop got behind my car
I wish he would pull me over now

Last night I let myself remember
Times I forgot a woman's name
I blacked out behind the wheel
How tight the handcuffs feel
My daughter's eyes when she's ashamed

It gets easier, but it never gets easy
I can say it's all worth it, but you won't believe me
You can't expect her to follow your lead
She's fine with her wine and her weed
It gets easier but it never gets easy
It never gets easy

It gets easier but it never gets easy
I can say it's all worth it but you won't believe me
Hold down your liquor or swallow your pride
You'd rather keep it inside
It gets easier but it never gets easy
It never gets easy
It never gets easy

// Letting You Go //

The nurse helped us buckle the seat in the car
And they sent us on our way, I drove home so slow
We had no instructions, the first days were hard
But there's things about babies a woman just knows

Three in the morning I lay my hand over
Your heart just to know you were safe in your sleep
When you started walking I fight back the urge
To stay right there beside you, keep you on your feet

Being your daddy comes natural
The roses just know how to grow
It's easy to see that you'll get where you're going
The hard part is letting you go
The hard part is letting you go

It didn't take long to see you got the best of me
And your mama's merciful heart in your eyes
And helping her raise you has taught me to see through
The great fog of loneliness, the devil's the sky

Being your daddy comes natural
The roses just know how to grow
It's easy to see that you'll get where you're going
But the hard part is letting you go
The hard part is letting you go

And now you've decided to be someone's wife
And we'll walk down the aisle and I'll give you away
I wish I could walk with them back through your life
To see every last minute of every last day

To hear your first words and to feel your first heartbreak
To sing you to sleep when you're scared of the dark
The best I can do is to let myself trust that you know
Who'll be strong enough to carry your heart

And being your daddy comes natural
The roses just know how to grow
It's easy to see that you'll get where you're going
The hard part is letting you go
The hard part is letting you go
