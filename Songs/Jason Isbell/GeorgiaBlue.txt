// Nightswimming //

Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
The photograph on the dashboard taken years ago
Turned around backwards so the windshield shows
Every streetlight reveals the picture in reverse
Still, it's so much clearer
I forgot my shirt at the water's edge
The moon is low tonight

Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
I'm not sure all these people understand
It's not like years ago
The fear of gettin' caught
Of recklessness and water
They cannot see me naked
These things, they go away
Replaced by everyday

Nightswimming, remembering that night
September's coming soon
I'm pining for the moon
And what if there were two
Side by side in orbit around the fairest sun?
That bright, tight forever drum
Could not describe nightswimming

You, I thought I knew you
You, I cannot judge
You, I thought you knew me
This one laughing quietly
Underneath my breath
Nightswimming

The photograph reflects
Every streetlight a reminder
Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
Deserves a quiet night

// Honeysuckle Blue //

Feel the southern breezes and the southern wind
Blowing down around the corner bend
D'Agostino's late last night
I saw a boy, fifteen, the road
With nothing in his pockets, his hands to the sky
And nowhere else to go

Can you see it or believe it?
he's never been
So come with me I'll show you
Where the dogwoods bloom, it's true
Lost and found and lost again
To the Honeysuckle Blue

Runnin' through these caverns of gold
Runs a river of death indeed
An old hotel serves as a shelter
For children of the street
Abandoned by the promised land
Set sail on their own
How much longer will the well
Be dry for those who roam?

I got a ticket in my pocket
To send the corner man he's never been
Have you ever seen the Blue Ridge Mountains, boy?
Or the Chattahoochee or the Honeysuckle Blue?

[?]

Lost and found and lost again
To the Honeysuckle Blue

// It's a Man's World //

This is a man's world
This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Nothing without a woman or a girl

You see man made the cars, we make the road
Man made the train, we're still carrying the heavy load
Man made electric light to find a way out of the dark
Man made the boat for water, he run away from Mother Earth's arms

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothing
Without a woman or a girl, oh

This is a man's world
But it wouldn't mean nothing
Without a woman or a girl

Just think about our little bitty baby girls and our baby boys
Man makes 'em happy 'cause man buys them toys
And after man makes everything he can
You know that man makes money
He makes all that money to steal from another man

This is a man's world, a man's world
Wouldn't mean nothing, nothing
Without a woman or a girl

The fire, the pouring rain
Can't take us, the ones you bring
You bring your package and cut the string
You're not the only ones living in the world full of pain, full of pain

You say it's a man's world
But you wouldn't have nobody in the world
Without a woman or a girl

// Cross Bones Style //

Oh, how time flies with crystal clear eyes
And cold as coal when you're ending with diamond eyes

Oh, come child in a cross bones style
Oh, come child, come and rescue me
'Cause you have seen some unbelievable things
Hater, I have your diamonds and still

'Cause you have seen some unbelievable things
Oh, come child in a cross bones style
Oh, come child, come and rescue me

'Cause you have seen some unbelievable things
Hater, I have your diamonds and still, so still

Oh, how time flies with crystal clear eyes
And cold as coal when you're ending with diamond eyes

Oh, come child in a cross bones style
Oh, come child, come and rescue me
'Cause you have seen some unbelievable things

Come child

// The Truth //

I told my baby
Just the other night
That if you mistreat me
There gonna be a fight

That is why
That is why
I like the truth, yeah
I like the truth, yes
I like the truth

I told my baby
Just the day before
That if you mistreat me
They're gonna hit my door

That is why
That is why
I like the truth, yeah
I like the truth, yes
I like the truth

I said I told my baby
That afternoon
That if you mistreat me
You'll be leaving soon

That is why
That is why
I like the truth, yeah
I like the truth, yes
I like the truth, yeah
I like the truth

I told my baby
Just the other day
That if you mistreat me
You'll be goin' away

That is why
That is why
I like the truth, yeah
I like the truth, yes
I like the truth

// I've Been Loving You Too Long //

I've been loving you too long to stop now
You are tired and you wanna be free
My love is growing stronger as you become a habit to me
I've been loving you a little bit too long, I don't wanna stop now

With you, my life has been so wonderful, just can't stop now
You are tired and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger as our affair, affair grows old
And I've been loving you a little bit too long, too long to stop now

Oh, oh
I've been loving you a little bit too long
I don't wanna stop now, oh
Don't make me stop now
Don't make me stop now
I don't wanna stop now
I don't wanna stop now
'Cause I love you
I love you, I love you
Oh yes I do
I don't wanna stop now
Don't make me stop now

// Sometimes Salvation //

To lessen my troubles
I stopped hanging out with vultures
And empty saviors like you
Well, I wish I had a nickel
For every miracle
That you easily tricked me into

Well, you can lead a horse to water
But faith is another matter
So don't you surrender
'Cause sometimes salvation
In the eye of the storm
Sister, do you even wanna try and find me?

I've no time for accusations
Or conversations
On all the bad, bad things that you do
Just a note from your jailor
On drugs and their relations
To all the people around you

And you can lead a horse to water
Oh, but faith is another matter
So don't you surrender
'Cause sometimes salvation
In the eye of the storm
Oh sister, do you wanna try to find me?

I've kept secret your superstitions
And all its twisted wisdom
That I fell right into

And you can lead a horse to water
Oh, but faith is another matter
So don't you surrender, don't you surrender
'Cause sometimes salvation
Sometimes salvation
Sometimes salvation
Sometimes salvation
In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm
Sister, do you even wanna try and find me?
Sister, do you even wanna try to find me?

// Kid Fears //

Pain from pearls, hey little girl
How much have you grown?
Pain from pearls, hey little girl
Flowers for the ones you've known

Are you on fire from the years?
What would you give for your kid fears?

Secret staircase running high
You had a hiding place
Secret staircase running low
But they all know now you're inside

Are you on fire from the years?
What would you give for your kid fears?
Your kid fears

Skipping stones, we know the price now
Any sin will do
How much further, if you can spin?
How much further, if you are smooth?

Are you on fire from the years?
From the years?
What would you give for your kid fears?
What would replace the rent with the stars above?
Replace the need with love
Replace the anger with the tide
Replace the ones, the ones, the ones that you love
The ones that you love

Are you on fire?
Replace the rent with the stars above
Are you on fire from all the years?
Replace the need with love
Replace the anger with the tide
What would you give for your kid fears?
Are you on fire?
Replace the rent with the stars above
Are you on fire from all the years?
Replace the need with love
What would you give for your kid fears?
What would you give for your kid fears?
What would you give for your kid fears?
Your kid fears

// Reverse //

In the distance, I hear a cryin' out
A choir of voices singing
Oh, you've done it now to satisfy the crowd

In a sleight of hand and a burst of light
I walk you through your motions
And you will rise tonight over the fires high

If you fall into their arms, you lose
Everything is coming unglued
And the hardest part's in front of you
Out of your hands giving up to

Reverse
They're closing in on every other side
Reverse
They're closing in on every other side

Draw the curtains tight, lock up in a room
In a lonely fit of certainty, they're onto you
Not any sudden moves

Don't remember when they were all right
In your tunnel vision, one solution crept up
You're holding out for love

But the cards close up before you move
You're adamant it's your time
Make a fuss with nothing to lose
And your eyes lock in to see it through
Your head in the mouth of a lion
Your knees giving in under you

Reverse
They're closing in on every other side
Reverse
They're closing in on every other side

// Midnight Train To Georgia //

Mm L.A
Proved too much for the man
(Too much for the man he couldn't make it)
So he's leaving the life he's come to know
(He said he's going)
He said he's going back to find
(Going back to find)
Ooh ooh ooh what's left of his world
The world he left behind
Not so long ago

He's leaving (leaving)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train)
Said he's going back to find (Going back to find)
A simpler place and time
(Whenever he takes that ride, guess who's gonna be right by his side)

And I'll be with him (I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train to Georgia, woo woo)
I'd rather live in his world
Than be without him in mine
(That world is his, his and hers alone)

He kept dreaming (Dreaming)
Ooh that someday he'd be a star
(A superstar but he didn't get far)
But he sure found out the hard way
That dreams don't always come true
(Dreams don't always come true)
Oh oh

So he pawned all his hopes
And he even sold his own car
Bought a one-way ticket back
To the life, the life he once knew
He said he would

Oh oh he's leaving (leaving)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train )

I said he's going back to find (Going back to find)
Ooh a simpler place and time
(Whenever he takes that ride, guess who's gonna be right by his side)
And I've gotta be with him (I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train to Georgia, woo woo)
I'd rather live in his world (Live in his world)
Than live without him in mine
(Her world is his, his and hers alone)

Ooh, he's leaving, oh
(Leaving)
On the midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on the midnight train)
Said he's going back to find
(Going back to find)
Ooh, a simpler place and time
(Whenever he takes that ride, guess who's gonna be right by his side)
I've got to be with him
(I know you will)
On that midnight train to Georgia
(Leaving on a midnight train to Georgia, woo woo)
I'd rather live in his world
(Live in his world)
Than live without him in mine
(Her world is his, his and hers alone)

For love, I'm gonna board, gonna board the midnight train to ride
For love, gonna board, gotta board the midnight train to go
For love, gonna board, uh huh, the midnight train to go
My world, his world, our world, mine and his alone
My love, his love, I'm gonna board the midnight train
I've gotta go, I've gotta go, I've gotta go
I've gotta go, I've gotta go
My world, his world, my man, his girl
I got to go
I got to go, oh
I got to go
My world, his world, our world, his girl

// I'm Through //

Forget everything I ever told you
I'm sure I lied way more than twice
But understand I am not Emily Post
You know I'm nowhere near that precise

And I struggle with these etiquettes like you wouldn't believe
I'm puzzled by the policy
'Cause after everything else you draw out of me
You still expect cute curtsies

But I'm through, through, through
Carrying you on my shoulders
And I'm through, through, through
Hiding
I'm through, through, through
Living my life for you
Yes, I hope for both our sakes
I'm through, through, through

I hope you're happy now with your hold on me
It sure struck me awful strong
And don't you dare call this disloyalty
There's no way you could be more wrong

I'm just dragging my devotion in a last-ditch retreat
Seeking some safety
I'm tired of bleeding for no good reason
Is that so hard to see?

But I'm through, through, through
Carrying you on my shoulders
And I'm through, through, through
Hiding
I'm through, through, through
Living my life for you
Yes, I hope for both our sakes
I'm through, through, through

// Driver 8 //

The walls are built up, stone by stone
The fields divided one by one
And the train conductor says, "Take a break, Driver 8
Driver 8, take a break, we've been on this shift too long"

And the train conductor says (Driver 8)
"Take a break, Driver 8 (Driver 8)
Driver 8, take a break
We can reach our destination
But we're still a ways away
But we're still a ways away"

Saw a treehouse on the outskirts of the farm
The power lines have floaters so the airplanes won't get snagged
The bells are ringin' through the town again
The children look up, but all they hear is sky-blue bells ringin'

And the train conductor says (Driver 8)
"Take a break, Driver 8 (Driver 8)
Driver 8, take a break
We can reach our destination
But we're still a ways away
But it's still a ways away
But we're still a ways away
But it's still a ways away"

A way to shield the hated heat
A way to put myself to sleep
A way to shield the hated heat
A way to put myself and my children to sleep

He piloted this song in a plane like that one
And she is selling faith on the Go Tell Crusade
Locomotive 8, Southern Crescent, hear the bells ring again
And the fields of wheat is lookin' thin

And the train conductor says (Driver 8)
"Take a break, Driver 8 (Driver 8)
Driver 8, take a break
We've been on this shift too long"
And the train conductor says (Driver 8)
"Take a break, Driver 8 (Driver 8)
Driver 8, take a break
We can reach our destination
But we're still a ways away
But it's still a ways away
But we're still a ways away
But it's still a ways away"
