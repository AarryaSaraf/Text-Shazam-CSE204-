Album: Sucker

// Sucker //

You said you wanna bang
Well, fuck you, sucker!

Head bang (bang), pink rocks (rocks)
Gold fangs (flexing), shit hot
Brick walls, don't stop
My hands, fresh cuts (sick)

Oh dear God, do you get me now, do you get me now, oh, you do?
Wow, you're awesome
Oh dear God, I'm a killer now, I'm a killer now, so are you
Wow you're awesome

You said you wanna bang
Well
Fuck you! Sucker!
You said you wanna bang
Well
Fuck you! Sucker!

Invites, non-stop
Bleached out (fuck it), blue yachts
You joined my club
Luke loves (love it), your stuff (sick)

Oh dear God, do you get me now, do you get me now, oh, you do?
Wow you're awesome
Oh dear God, I'm a killer now, I'm a killer now (killer now, killer now, killer now)

You said you wanna bang
Well
Fuck you! Sucker!
You said you wanna bang
Well
Fuck you! Sucker!

Sitting on a plastic speedboat
In the ultraviolet ocean
Playing cool songs
Trying to show off
Wow you're awesome
Wow you're awesome

Bang, bang
Bang, bang
Bang, bang
I'm a killer
Fuck you! Sucker!
Sucker!
Sucker!
Sucker!
Fuck you!

// Break The Rules //

Electric lights
Blow my mind
I feel alright

Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

You catch my eye
Bitch, you wanna fly?
I'm so alive

Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

I'm such a star
Queen Boulevard
Blaze through the dark

Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

Get my guitar
Sunglasses on
So light it up

Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

Na na na na na na na

// London Queen //

Ride away from Holloway
I said "Mum, this isn't a holiday
Listen up, I ain't coming back
'Til I can fill the shack up with all gold plaques."
Soon come, home run, whack!
Knock it out the park with a baseball bat

When I'm driving on the wrong side of the road
I feel like JFK you know

I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way, yay yay
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London queen (oi!)

Now I live in Hollywood
I can't stop even though I know I should
It feels so good, oh yeah, oh oh
When I'm driving on the wrong side of the road
I feel like JFK you know

I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London queen, oi!
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way
I never thought I'd be living in the USA

Living the dream like a London queen, oi!
Living the dream like a London queen, oi!
Living the dream like a London queen, oi!
Living the dream like a London queen, oi!
Living the dream like a London queen

Oi, oi, oi (whack)
Oi, oi
Oi, oi, oi (whack)
Oi, oi

I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London queen, oi!
I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Doing things the American way

I never thought I'd be living in the USA
Living the dream like a London queen, oi!
Living the dream like a London queen
Living the dream like a London queen
Living the dream like a London queen
Living the dream like a London queen, oi!

// Breaking Up //

You said you love me (I said what)
You said you love me (okay let's rock)
You said you love me (I said what)
You said you love me (okay let's rock)

You had an ugly tattoo, and fucking cheap perfume
You couldn't dance, barely moved, I didn't know what to do
You had a friend in a band, but they're not that cool
You said you love me (okay let's rock)

Everything was wrong with you
So breaking up was easy to do
Hated your friends and your family too
So breaking up was easy to do
Breaking up! (Breaking up)
Breaking up! (Breaking up)

You said you love me (I said what)
You said you love me (okay let's rock)
You said you love me (I said what)
You said you love me (okay let's rock)

You tried to pull this apart and make a brand new start
You tried to drive me to France, we didn't get very far
You said forever but baby I'm not so sure
You said you loved me (okay, let's rock)

Everything was wrong with you
So breaking up was easy to do
Hated your friends and your family too
So breaking up was easy to do
Breaking up! (Breaking up)
Breaking up! (Breaking up)

You said you love me (I said what)
You said you love me (okay let's rock)
You said you love me (I said what)
You said you love me (okay let's rock)

// Gold Coins //

My grills are so neat
Drip icy cold
Got offshore bank accounts and diamond blue palm trees
My platinum troubles are drowning in pink champagne
Escape into the sky in my own private jet
That's what I dream of in my head

Gold coins everywhere
Dollars up in the air
It's a billionaire's love affair

Gold coins out the window
Money pours like the rain falls
And I'm spending like I don't care

Richlist and Bentleys
That's how I roll
These rock stars buy me pearls topped off with rubies rare
I stack it so high
Build a pretty green castle wall
I'll hide inside my fortress, smoking in my bed
That's what I dream of in my head

Gold coins everywhere
Dollars up in the air
It's a billionaire's love affair

Gold coins everywhere
Dollars up in the air
It's a billionaire's love affair

Gold coins everywhere
Dollars up in the air
It's a billionaire's love affair

// Boom Clap //

You're picture-perfect blue
Sunbathing under the moon
Stars shining as your bones illuminate
First kiss just like a drug
Under your influence
You take me over, you're the magic in my veins
This must be love

Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

No silver or no gold
Could dress me up so good
You're the glitter in the darkness of my world
Just tell me what to do
I'll fall right into you
We're going under cast the spell, just say the word
I feel your love!

Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

You are the light and I will follow
You let me lose my shadow
You are the sun, the glowing halo
And you keep burning me up with all your love, oh

Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

// Body Of My Own //

You're so damn cold
You got no feeling
I want my blood hotter
Not satisfied
I need to taste it
Your sex is so over

Got the gun in my hand and I point it straight
To the target and I'm gonna blow my brains
I don't need you, my touch is better
I'm rolling much hotter

Lights out, I'm on
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
'Cause I'm gone, so high
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
'Cause I can make it feel just like I'm hanging on
Yeah, I can do it better when I'm all alone
Lights out, so high
All alone
I got a body of my own

I'm in control
My hands are shaking
My skin's getting wetter
I'm coming close
It's overloaded
I walk in with fire

Spin around in my head, I'm screaming out
But with you in the room I can never shout
This heroin, I'm sinking so deep
Wish I could stay here forever

Lights out, I'm on
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
'Cause I'm gone, so high
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
'Cause I can make it feel just like I'm hanging on
Yeah, I can do it better when I'm all alone
Lights out, so high
All alone
I got a body of my own

Lights out
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
'Cause I'm gone, so high
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
'Cause I'm gone, so high
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
'Cause I'm gone, so high
Got my darkness
I'm into myself, don't need you
'Cause I'm gone

// Famous //

Bored on Friday night
Spinning 'round just like I'm hypnotised, oh
Need some neon lights
Wanna feel like I'm electrified, so help me out

Get your boyfriend's car
Come and pick me up, oh
Let's take it for a ride
What trouble can we find?

One night, and we're gonna come and crash the party
Weren't invited but we're feeling so outrageous
Just like we're famous
Got one night, and we're gonna come and get it started
Now we're falling down the stairs
We act so shameless
Come on, let's lose control!

Blown up like balloons
Purple glitter flying through the air, oh-oh
Sweat drips from the roof
And you know we're Lucy in this sky of diamonds

Music playing loud
Tripping through the crowd, oh
Put your sunglasses on
Don't care if we look dumb

One night, and we're gonna come and crash the party
Weren't invited but we're feeling so outrageous
Just like we're famous
Got one night, and we're gonna come and get it started

// Hanging Around //

Help me out, I need escape
It's the truth, I got to go
With all the boys in the back alley
And all my girls in the superstore
Because we need electricity
City lights gotta glow for me
Oh I'm more than a car park queen
So get your shit now, we got to roll

Let's blow out of this town
Too bored, hanging around
Sky high, head in the clouds
Never gonna come down
Drums, bass, turn 'em up loud
Free fall, spinning around
Sky high, head in the clouds
Never gonna come down

Take the car and cut the brakes
Driving out into the dark
Even though I love mum and dad
I wanna swim out there with the sharks
I wanna learn to speak Japanese
Razor-sharp on the silver screen
We were made for a limousine
So get your shit now and come with me

Let's blow out of this town
Too bored, hanging around
Sky high, head in the clouds
Never gonna come down
Drums, bass, turn 'em up loud
Free fall, spinning around
Sky high, head in the clouds
Never gonna come down

Blowing bubbles out in the grass
All tangled in the stars, getting faded in the back seat
You can be hanging with us
We used to walk around the back streets
Swimming pools with no heat
Fuck a dream, I want it for real
Always make it look so easy, moving to the city
Take a little sip of surreal
We're much more than nothing, yeah, we're all just trying to be who we feel

Throwing cake up in the air, we don't care, no
Surfing on a silver wave, wanna let go
We're so bored of being here, we don't care, no
I wanna run, be wild and free, and with my friends standing next to me

Let's blow out of this town
Too bored, hanging around
Sky high, head in the clouds
Never gonna come down
Drums, bass, turn 'em up loud
Free fall, spinning around
Sky high, head in the clouds
Never gonna come down

Hey!
Oo-ah-ah
Oo-ah-ah
Hanging a-
Hanging a-
Hey!
Oo-ah-ah
Oo-ah-ah
Hanging a-
Hanging around

Hey!
Oo-ah-ah
Oo-ah-ah
Hanging a-
Hanging a-
Hey!
Oo-ah-ah
Oo-ah-ah
Hanging a-
Hanging around

// So Over You //

I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?

Just a little girl on the TV screen
Stuck inside a silver cage
Body tangled up in chains
I'm looking for the light in the misery
All this love is doomed to pain
Everyday, I feel the same

My tears, they cried like a waterfall in the light
My roses don't bloom since you left me blue
You've got to stop
Tryna mess around with my heart
It's true, I'm through, babe with you

I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
I promise, baby, that you will never forget me

Tryna fly away, tryna spread my wings
Soaring like a golden bird
Blocking out the things I heard
97 girls on your cameraphone
Secrets kinda suck to burn
Wish I coulda heard it from you first (ha ha ha ha)

My tears, they cried like a waterfall in the light
My roses don't bloom since you left me blue
You've got to stop
Tryna mess around with my heart
It's true, I'm through, babe with you

I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
I promise, baby, that you will never forget me

Saw you at the party with everybody
You look so lonely when you're on your own
I know we both remember hanging together
We were so happy
Now we're moving on

I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, will you ever regret me?
I'm so over you
Tell me, baby, are you over me?
I'm so over you
I promise, baby, that you will never forget me

Saw you at the party with everybody
You look so lonely when you're on your own

// Die Tonight //

Oh, I could die tonight
'Cause I got the magic in my veins
And I'm going hard with all my friends
I could die tonight

Let's get it started
Poolside at the party
Rolling Stones on my phone
Hanging in your bedroom, feeling like we're rock 'n' roll
End of the summer
Up and down with lovers
Laying under stars that shine
Hold up our palms now, don't you know that it's our time?

Oh, I could die tonight
'Cause I got the magic in my blood
And I'm staying 'til the sun comes up
Oh whoa, I could die tonight
'Cause I got the magic in my veins
And I'm going hard with all my friends
I could die tonight

Back at the hotel
Ringing off the doorbells
Now we're feeling so alive
Climb to the top floor, jumpin' like we're 'bout to fly
No one's leaving
'Bout to blow the ceiling
When we turn it up to ten
Wake up in the morning, gonna do it all again

Oh, I could die tonight
'Cause I got the magic in my blood
And I'm staying 'til the sun comes up
Oh whoa, I could die tonight
'Cause I got the magic in my veins
And I'm going hard with all my friends
I could die tonight

Oh, I could die tonight
'Cause I got the magic in my blood
And I'm staying 'til the sun comes up
Oh whoa, I could die tonight
'Cause I got the magic in my veins
And I'm going hard with all my friends
I could die tonight

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
(Die tonight)
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
(Die tonight)

// Caught In The Middle //

Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love

Our hearts got caught in the middle
Caught in the middle of love

Took the plane at five
Flew across the world, I'm the other girl
The one who's in your head
Laid there by your side
In the city nights, naked in the lights
Hiding secrets in your bed

'Cause we tried to turn around, but we can't stop it now
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love
You're stuck on my mind
Push restart, press rewind
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love

Lost inside the line
Stare across the room, almost fallin' through
Never make the same mistake
Harder every time
Wish we could be true, always wantin' you
We gotta stay a mystery
Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of

'Cause we tried to turn around, but we can't stop it now
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love
You're stuck on my mind
Push restart, press rewind
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love

Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of
('Cause we)
Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of
('Cause we)
Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of
('Cause we)
Oh, I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle of

'Cause we tried to turn around, but we can't stop it now
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love
You're stuck on my mind
Push restart, press rewind
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love
Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love

Our hearts got caught in the middle, caught in the middle of love

// Need Ur Luv //

I need your love
I need it even when it hurts me
I won't give up
I won't give up, so come and get me

Boy, you really messed around
Put me six feet underground
Always kick me when I'm down
But I'm still driving through your town

Tried to fake it, I can't take it
Boy you trapped my heart
I can't shake it, 'bout to break into a hundred million parts

I need your love
I need it even when it hurts me

I won't give up, so come and get me

I need your love
I need it even when it hurts me
I won't give up

Wish that you could wear my crown
And feel the weight I'm feeling now
But I can't help but say your name
It's lightning when you're in my veins

Tried to fake it, I can't take it
Boy you trapped my heart
I can't shake it, 'bout to break into a hundred million parts

I need your love

Boy, you really broke my heart
Took my love and tore it up
But I'm coming back for you
Coming clean out of the blue
All the things you did to me
I forgive them quietly
But I will never forget
And still I end up in your bed

(I need your love)
I don't want it
(I need it even when it hurts me)
You really hurt me, baby
(I won't give up)
Now, I'm giving up

Don't you come and get me, baby

// Money (That's What I Want) //

The best things in life are free
But you can't give them to the birds and bees
I want money
That's what I want
That's what I want

Your love gives me such a thrill
But your love won't pay my bills
I want money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want
Oh

What it don't get, I can't use
I want that money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want

I want money
I want lots of money
In fact, I want so much money
Give me that money
Get, get, get, get me money
Get, get, get, get me money
I want that money

Don't let your worries get to you
Let 'em float on by, high into the sky
Just like a red balloon
So turn it up now! (Oh!)
So turn it up now! (Ah-ooh!)

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
So turn it up now!
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

// Break The Rules (Femme Remix) //

Electric lights
Blow my mind
I feel alright

Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

Electric lights
Blow my mind
I feel alright

Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

You catch my eye
Bitch, you wanna fly?
I'm so alive

Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

I'm such a star
Queen Boulevard
Blaze through the dark

Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

Get my guitar
Sunglasses on
So light it up

Never stop, it's how we ride
Coming up until we die

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules

I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
Boys and girls across the world
Putting on our dancing shoes
Going to the discotheque
Getting high and getting wrecked
I don't wanna go to school
I just wanna break the rules
