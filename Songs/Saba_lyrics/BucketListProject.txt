Album: BucketListProject

// In Loving Memory //

Turn a obstacle obsolete
Turn a cheek, poverty, heritage, cotton seed
I could be lotta things, lottery winner
This album autobiography, I feel like Socrates
Hypothesis: opposites attract
Squares around the block again, Turn a obstacle obsolete
I believe I can fly, "R Kelly", awkwardly
Ain't really popular, prolly 'cause, they all doubted but I was up while they slept
While they said I wouldn't amount to much, I was hit
I knew that if I ain't older, I turn a obstacle obsolete
Up the street where they bang, I ain't hang
Out the jam, wap da bam, I'll pretend all our friends still alive
Still apply for the fall, cap and gown, for the fail
Furthermore, first of all, curtain call, shirt and tie, I'm a paul... bearer
Turn a obstacle course to a porket, weigh out a horse in a carriage that wasn't in your inheritance
Splitting parts as we jumpin' offa the porch again
Portuguese, we don't speaks it but poetry hopelessly hope the Lord'll see when our dreams get... torn apart
On the tar, left the kid, on your mark
Joan of Arc, genocide, second time, Noah's Ark
Now you're dead, no one saw

When I'm dead, and I'm gone
Would you smile, cause you know
Where I've been, and gone?
When you're dead, and you're gone
Would I smile, cause I know
Where you've been?
When I'm dead, and I'm gone
Would you smile, cause you know
Where I've been, and gone?
When you're dead, and you're gone
Would I smile...

"My name's Will Fountain...
Three things off my bucket list:
One, I wanna have a meal from In-N-Out, 'cause I live nowhere near one
Two, I wanna go one on one against D. Rose
And three, I wanna fuck Kylie Jenner"

[Saba:]
Ah, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, hahaha
Yeah, yeah, aye, aye
Yeah...

Pull up in my bucket and I'm feeling like fuck it
Use to dream about it when my cousin had a cutlass
We were making moves, 19 with the shwoop
Hit up Jay Caves, turned it to a video
Riding with the windows up because my shit is broke, just like we were broke
Coppers tryna impound vehicle, we all see 'em though
Aye, Squeaky had a Buick he would play our latest music, aye
I just backseat drive, catch the vibes, in a hooptie, aye
I don't got a crib but I tell my lady move it, aye
She would take her sister car then someone crashed into her, aye
Yeah, I still wish it
And if it breakdown then I'm getting out and pushin'
Aye, me and Walt was on the E way and we blew the trans
Now I'm on the train, like ehe, damn
Yeah, tryna finesse Uber with a new email
"Aye, Saba, love your story, man, do please tell"

Aye, pull up in my bucket and I'm feeling like fuck it
Felt the same way when I ain't pull up in nothing
CTA short, balling on a budget
Riding in this hooptie 'till the next thing coming
I'ma pull up in my bucket and I'm feeling like fuck it
Felt the same way when I ain't pull up in nothing
CTA short, balling on a budget
Riding in this hooptie 'till the next thing coming, aye

Kobe whipped a station wagon and he hotbox that bih'
He'll pick me up from school, "Nephew, hop in."
Came home straight skunk like I know my mama mad, aye
Still don't smoke but I smell like my friends
All my nigga day one like they just got the job
Never bought a train card, but bet they will train hop
Aye, aye, aye, major key, tell them take a seat
Yeah, I just bought a hooptie I can get from A to B
Yeah, wasn't ally swoopin, had to stop with Casa B
Yeah, wildin' with my brother's Waters, can't wait till he free
Yeah, this shit sound like CTA, my new shit coming TBA
Remember they ain't show no love, now it's only PDA
Yeah, that's as it stands
I just got my L's, now I whip a minivan
Aye, high school in the 'burb but I'm still a city man
Aye, screaming Pivot loud as fuck 'cause that is really fam

Pull up in my bucket and I'm feeling like fuck it
Felt the same way when I ain't pull up in nothing
CTA short, balling on a budget
Riding in this hooptie till the next thing coming
I'ma pull up in my bucket and I'm feeling like fuck it
Felt the same way when I ain't pull up in nothing
CTA short, balling on a budget
Riding in this hooptie till the next thing coming, aye

[Phoelix & BJRKNC:]
There are so many reasons to live alone
There is only one reason to die for you
When I'm away, know my heart, it shows
And through Jerusalem will I ride for you

// GPS //

[Saba:]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh
Oh, oh
Oh...

Where's your head?
Where's your soul? Your heart?
Where's your love? Your care?
Where's your life? Your scars?
You're lost

Ah, ah, ah, look
Earth can be so lonely, glad we're all in heaven
Bet he can count a dollar couldn't count a blessing
Where's your head? You neck-less for a fucking necklace
Oo, put that shit on record bet they get the message
Just like after the beep, wear my rap on my sleeve
Wear my heart on my tongue
Where you think that I speak from its blood on my teeth
Like a opp nigga, we opposed
I'm at the crib playing neo-soul
Dropped out, I don't need a loan
That same school booking me a show
Droppin college collect like an audit
I'm a artist problem what you call it
I'm a honest artist so they honor
Or we fighting fans like Ron Artest
I'm the coldest out I'm so arctic
And I'm from the same place the solids come from and I run shit like Sonic
With my songs and all of my sonnets signing

Where's your head?
Where's your soul? Your heart?
Where's your love? Your care?
Where's your life? Your scars?
You're lost

Oo, oo
Food can make you forget that the world is famished
They on me like the new kid, this my college campus
All these women want me like my name was Channing
Tatum, I don't even take em y'all can all still have em
Like I got my own, greed kill man, man still'll want more
Niggas spoon fed, talkin bout they poor, niggas be broke talkin like they on
I don't really care what oppers say though, they change they self for compensation
Last year I just had to lay low, now pass the torch like hot potato, aheh
'Cause I'm on it, take the green line out west to Austin
Dropped the best project since The Chronic
Like a nerd freshman how I'm locked in
I been, aheh, off that... dub, a nigga then I don't rematch
Grind mode nigga I don't relax, ay, go 'head play this back
Sab

Where's your head?
Where's your soul? Your heart?
Where's your love? Your care?
Where's your life? Your scars?
You're lost

Where's your head?
Where's your soul? Your heart?
Where's your love? Your care?
Where's your life? Your scars?
You're lost

[Twista:]
I tell em pop that trunk cause sound deaf
Got kush and I smoke that blunt cause I'm blessed
Flow with the funk then I'm fresh
And I got that cause I come from out west
I was raised around thugs and ballers
Something was happening whenever I come through
Hangin with the gang or with the crew
Anxious just to show I could do
And though the gas will spark when it got real dark
We were gon take it to Garfield park
To the holy city, yeah K-Town, and go downtown so I can show em that I'm real sharp
Ain't nobody fuckin' with us
Circumstances hurt your chances when you see how we comin'
On my mama Saba when he got the OG on me homie no wait we don't want nothin'
Breakin atoms if we causin' destruction
Makin patterns if we causin' eruptions
Second thoughts if you see us in the functions
Smokin weed if you see us into somethin'
Do ya thang and make ya money stack ya paper
Go ahead represent ya crew
As long as you respect the west side of Chi' do what the fuck you wanna do
Twista

Where's your head?
Where's your soul? Your heart?
Where's your love? Your care?
Where's your life? Your scars?
You're lost

[FRSH Waters:]
Comin from one of them avenue babies, hailin from the west side, nigga tryna make it to the grammys, at least somewhere. Somewhere more than where a mothafucka been. Bucket list means something like, ya know you ever set up and dream and dreamed a dream and that dream done came true? Ha ha ha ha ha... chuuuuuuch

// Church / Liquor Store //

[Akenya:]
Oooh, ahhh
Oooh, ahhh

[Saba:]
They ask you what's the cause and effect
Of doobies packed in they fat
Now you calling collect, they booby trapping the trap
The police pulling a pulley, you'll fall for it you silly
Putty you outta shape, fuck running, you'll catch a case
I can't relate to half of my relatives
My genetics is felony, buying low and reselling it
They told me tell a story, I'm like "Why not mine?"
Shit everybody taking pictures, I'm like "Why not Vine?"
And growin' from the ground up, it look like I'm a vine
It's rarity in my realness, yeah I'm a fine, diamond in the rough type
Rough type, roughhouse in a roadhouse like rugby
Lovely, when you hit a lick little kick like Chun-Li
Funny, kids that I hoop with all in county
Counting, black bodies hunt 'em down look like bounties
Bound to, be on the block a little while longer
They your homies, this what home is
What don't kill ya make ya stronger
Call Obama, Jesus, Yeezus, he can save Chicago
From the demons and the deacons when it's the end
Yeah, dodged precincts since pre-teens
Let's pretend we privileged not deceased, addicted

[Saba & Akenya:]
It look like funeral home, church, church, liquor store
Corner store, dread-head, deadly, ditto
10-4, ten foes from Cicero to Central
Was told, "Let it go," didn't know who to hit though
Now that's church, barber shop, bottle I got
From the liquor store on Cicero, I ain't 21, but he didn't know

[Saba:]
Bad habits of wrong places at wrong times
A stray bullet'll take your first-born like the Tenth Plague
I'm the new Pharoah, my phone line
Forever open for prayer, the fallen soldiers ain't fell
They in my pen, and I do thank God
They say preach like Cooley High
From beginning to end, that's Alpha and Omega
My city the same ghost that made Lupe cry
Soon's you loosen up your grip you lost, then lose your life
I loosen a dread from every time I gotta wash the cigarette smoke
From outta my head, like how I'm not dead
Going on 20 soon, they say I changed, that's a fitting room
I'm still the same kid that didn't speak when we were in the school
I just got a mic now, I turned to a real nigga
I just knocked the white gal, and fuck who you think I sound
Like, I'm a legend in the making like the director's cut
Of I Am Legend and I'm fed up with the fuck comparison
These niggas don't got the truth that y'all want, do they?
Think I'm lyin'? Then plan a trip to Chicago today
I was 15, they was fucking with me
There's no logic in love, but there's no love in the streets

[Saba & Akenya:]
It look like funeral home, church, church, liquor store
Corner store, dread-head, deadly, ditto
Sillou... -ette! Chalk outline, sketch!
It's not safe outside when they want your neck
Now that's church, barber shop, bottle I got
From the liquor store on Cicero, I ain't 21, but he didn't know

[Noname:]
They sold, they sold
They sold prison the way they pipeline, systematically lifeline
Erase all niggas, they so bulletproof from the law
Law abiding citizen shot, Willie Lynch do crack now
Made the new letters shiny, now we pray King Kunta
I hope the grave don't find me, I do my E&J kindly
I do my time when it's timely
Sometimes the bible tastes like marmalade
My momma still sipping
Politician owe Donald Duck a quacking new kitchen
They kept the melting pot inside the slave plot, watch
They gentrified your neighborhood no needs for cops, watch
Look at the yoga pants, coffee shops and yogurt stands
Consumerism, holy land
And on the other hand my momma land

[Saba & Akenya:]
It look like funeral home, church, church, liquor store
Corner store, dread-head, deadly-...

Man, give them people hell bro... on life, let 'em know how you feelin', yo, let 'em know what's going on, bro
Free us, every chance you get, free my nigga Marl
Free Jimmy... Fresh, yo, Frillz, yo
Let 'em know yo, keep us alive out there in them verses yo
On a real bro... aayt love bro, take care bro
Tell my brother, tell Fresh I said I love him
Tell him when you see Squeaky, tell him I love him
Tell your bro n'em I said wassup, I salute you bro
You sent old girl them pictures right? Aayt, flat bro, I love you bro, I'ma talk to you in a minute bro...
**Hangs up**
The caller has hung up

// Westside Bound 3 //

[Saba:]
And I'm from the part of the city that they don't be talking about
Austin my grandmama house
Madhouse on Madison, middle school graduate
Coulda been traffickin'
But I would rather do better than my uncle had it
My head to the sky like a Jesse White backflip

Westside nigga go crazy
Westside nigga go crazy
Westside nigga go crazy

And I'm from the part of the city that they don't be talking about
Austin my grandmama house
Madhouse on Madison, middle school graduate
Coulda been traffickin'
But I would rather do better than my uncle had it
My head to the sky like a Jesse White backflip
Slept on the palette
Promised my momma I'd turn it to palace
My granny house was right by Wallace's Catfish
Corner but lo and behold when its below zero and you watch your best friend hit the corner
And now I no longer even know him
Used to hoop daily we thought we was Jordan
He went on to high school but dropped out a junior
I went on to college he we went on a shooter he went on to juvi
I went out on tour
Bicycle with the juice in the wheel if you was a real nigga
We wouldn't have to hear ya keep proving yourself 'cause who really cares bout
What side or block your reppin
Your whereabouts will keep you seperate
All lost some niggas to some weapons
That's why I'm walking like I'm welcome
Hennessy bet they'll buy that
Just to pour it on the curb
We blinded like an eyepatch
Til your boy is in a hearse
Where the westside at? Shouts the thugs shouts the nerds
Shout the kids claiming Chiraq know you born in the burbs boy

Westside nigga go crazy
Westside nigga go crazy
Westside nigga go crazy
Westside nigga go crazy

And I'm from the part of the city that they don't be talking about
I gave the west side a new meaning
I took it to the Europeans
The police took my nigga freedom I probably be in there with him
Cause honestly I think just like all my niggas
And honestly I should've reached out to Twista like aye bro I got one I need you on this one
Austin, Division, ironic that that's the divide
Below the poverty line
My mother was on the southside
ZMoney told me hit his line
I caught the bus off of Pine
I say my words double time
Knock on wood I have not ever been robbed
But a few niggas tried on the train on my way to school a couple times

Westside nigga go crazy
Westside nigga go crazy
Westside nigga go crazy
Westside nigga go crazy

[Joseph Chilliams:]
And I'm from a part of the city I was sitting on my front porch when I saw my first tittie
Proud to throw the westside up when I was five watching Pac dissing Biggie
Whole fit off of Madison eating Uncle Remus fuck a Whole Foods
Shorty used to act like Stone Cold flipping niggas off cracking cold brews
Westside prep was my old school
The block was hot like Suzanne Somers
Seen someone that got hit with a shotty walk a block while he shitted his body
Cops came started lifting his body
I went back to watching NickToons
Watch your back when its mid june
You can always be my big spoon
Know you in the hood when you see the poles with the blue lights steady flashing like cheerleader clothes I remember letters in the first grade cause of GDs and fours
Mama speaking in code tryna get a job at the store
Never gonna get it like En Vogue
All my westside niggas go

[Stunt Taylor:]
On my bucket list, I want ten million dollars in my bank account
And I want to fuck ten bitches at the same time
This your boy, Stunt Taylor

// MOST //

[Saba:]
Dance with the lights on
Snakes and a python, wrong with your haircut?
Hand on the bible
Stage with the light show, bed with the bedbugs
Check if the mic on
For the check that I sign on, tell me what I'm worth
Sleep when it's bedtime
Gave up the airtime, whole city graveyard

Most of these dudes played varsity ball
Now, most of these dogs in jail or they gone
Yeah, and most of me dogs call most women hoes
While most of the youth blamed most of the suits

Album got a deadline
Blog with a headline, always ahead line
Dapped in the Alpine
Whole city bedtime, most of us flatline
Most of us die young
Niggas been starvin', all of us diet
Ball with a ballpoint
Lie to the All-Knowing like he not all-knowing

Most of these dude don't wanna be thugs
But most of these news call most of us thugs
And most of these shooters be the boys in the blue
And most of these doors don't open and close

Ay, most these niggas starve for so long, get a plate and
Forget to thank God, they forgot to say grace, hey
Most people, they only want to be seen, hey
Most people, they only want to be seen, hey (uh, uh, you can)
Mark my word, where I'm from isn't safe
(Mark my word, where I'm from isn't safe)
I'ma stay up out the Lawn
'Cause I don't want some snakes, hey
(I'ma stay up out the Lawn
'Cause I don't want some snakes, hey)
Most people, they were taught by the fake, hey
(Most who think they real, they were taught by the fake, hey)
Most people, they only want to be seen, hey
(Most these niggas hard, only want to be seen, 'een)

Ridin' with a new scent, chain like a new noose
Cop in the rear-view, save all your two cents
Try and catch me like Mewtwo, they'll be happy to shoot you
Life not some sitcom
Streamin' on Hulu, there's no one to the rescue
No one to defend you
They know that I've been through
What most of 'em been through

Most of the youth in love with a gun
'Cause most of the young don't wanna be young
And most of these dogs don't love anymore
We know where they go, like we readin' a palm

Ay, most these niggas starve for so long, get a plate and
Forget to thank God, they forgot to say grace, hey
Most people, they only want to be seen, hey
Most people, they only want to be seen, hey (uh, uh, you can)
Mark my word, where I'm from isn't safe
(Mark my word, where I'm from isn't safe)
I'ma stay up out the Lawn
'Cause I don't want some snakes, hey
(I'ma stay up out the Lawn
'Cause I don't want some snakes, hey)
Most people, they were taught by the fake, hey
(Most who think they real, they were taught by the fake, hey)
Most people, they only want to be seen, hey
(Most these, niggas hard, only want to be seen, 'een)

[Chance The Rapper:]
Yo, Chance The Rapper here
Uh, playin' drums
Learnin' how to play the drums
Has always been on my bucket list
Um, drummers just... they get the girl

// Symmetry //

Symmetric soul I know you are out there
My better half apart, we like a pair
The rest the world cannot come and compare
When you and me align, a line will form of those who came before us but they're mad they're unimportant
When I was 15 I would sit and fantasize
Bout the one day I could take my mom advice
This month a couple record deals gon' get declined
Cause you were hard to find, to find and fall in love and spend my life and die with by my side, side...

That's the symmetry, her and me, currently, oh
Simile, really need, you with me, oh
Enjoy, energy, with me, oh
And we'll just, be complete, 'till we, old
That's the symmetry, her and me, currently, oh
Simile, really need, you with me, oh
Enjoy, energy, with me, oh
And we'll just, be complete, 'till we, old

Baby don't rush (baby don't rush)
Hey don't rush it though (hey don't rush it though)
Cause we got plenty (cause we got plenty)
Time before we old (time before we old)
Baby don't rush (baby don't rush)
Hey don't rush it though (hey don't rush it though)
Cause we got plenty time

Symmetric soul, my soul is longing for you
And I just want you, I don't want no other
My exes, I know you may know a couple of
But you were never concerned with past lovers
I promise I'ma be here for a while
Only if you let me and I'm lucky
From up here we can see over the clouds
Baby what's your preference? Do you love me?
I know what happens is fate, I know God don't make mistakes
I see my future with you, I'll do whatever it takes, hey

That's the symmetry, her and me, currently, oh
Simile, really need, you with me, oh
Enjoy, energy, with me, oh
And we'll just, be complete, 'till we, old
That's the symmetry, her and me, currently, oh
Simile, really need, you with me, oh
Enjoy, energy, with me, oh
And we'll just, be complete, 'till we, old

Baby don't rush (baby don't rush)
Hey don't rush it though (hey don't rush it though)

If I tell you my story, would you then tell yours to me?
And live to see the day...
If I tell you my story, would you then tell yours to me?
And live to see that day...

[Jean Deaux:]
My bucket list... my last minute bucket list, ok
I wanna write television shows, films, have movie premieres
Well hella just hood glamour ass shit [Beep]. I wanna... degentrify our neighborhoods, like buy property and rent it back to the people who grew up there. And last but no least... I want to smoke a blunt with BeyoncÃ©, that's the most important for sure

// Photosynthesis //

[Jean Deaux"]
Got it, I got it, oh
Say what you're looking for, 'cause I got it, yeah, ay
I got it, I got it, oh
I got it, yeah

Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognize
Or see that the glare is bright
And what you compromise, I almost die
I doubt the water is red as mine

[Saba:]
Ay, how you lonely in a room with God?
Never slow up, not even a pit stop
Praying my niggas'll never get caught
Overcame it all, like I'm some big shot
Was taught to be a man, up to the wrist watch
To the collar shirt tucked, with the front pocket
Part of adolescence when they go blossom
When your stars align, I hope there's no comet
So far it's...
Oh yes, I made it alive, I'm on the West Side, still at my momma house
The kids on my conscience now, cause the youth dying and it's just more common now
Common ground, stuck through it all like we Carmelo
Comin' down, high offa life, arrive unannounced
Summonin', numbin' the pain of when I'm in doubt, high school
My head in the clouds, like I learned about

[Jean Deaux:]
Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognize
Or see that the glare is bright
And what you compromise, I almost die
I doubt the water is red as mine

[Jean Deaux & Saba:]
What are you looking for?
I got it (I got it)
I got it (I got it)
All the thing's you adore
I got it (I got it)
I got it (I got it)

[Saba:]
Runnin' through my city like a tour bus
Hopin' one day I can have a tour bus
I can see the planets from my window sill
And I tend to tell what is honest
I don't wanna fight no one, no contest
I just wanna undress my conscience
I just met a killer that's bent in his ways
Try to raise a family with minimum wage, what can I say?
Besides the demons, it's reality for the people that we love
And we are the ones that will team up and tee up the party
Dead end the school, but they'll show up tardy
The audience awfully ready and rowdy
I meant it if I said it, you get in writing
Got into a science, but write with the lightning
Like soil, I'm grounded, the seed has just sprouted

[Jean Deaux:]
Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognise
Or see that the glare is bright
And what you compromise, I almost die
I doubt the water is red as mine

[Jean Deaux & Saba:]
What are you looking for?
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
All, the thing's you adore
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
Show what you want, show what you want
Show what you want, show what you want

[Billy Williams:]
I just wanna be the plug so my people can eat
I just wanna play soccer on rooftops in Tokyo
I just wanna find somewhere I don't gotta put a face on for people no mo'
Yours truly, Billy Williams

Feel it in my spirit (that the end is nearing)
I can never fold

Comin' down off a high (high), feel you with my third eye (ehh)
I swear I don't even know y'all
I'm with Billy like I'm Road Dogg
Comin' down off a high (high), feel you with my third eye (eye)
I swear I don't even know y'all
I'm with Billy like I'm Road Dogg
Comin' down off it
(Aye, aye, ayee, aye, ayee, ayee, aye, aye)
Comin' down off it
(Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)

[Joshua(@_jdnice):]
All I ever wanted to do in my life was, make music. So... I guess, on my bucket list, what I really wanna do is-s, drop... a project. Like, nobody has to even listen to it. I just, wanna know that, I did it. Be able to say, I went out there and, did that and I chased my dreams. And that's really it

// Bucket List //

[Saba:]
(Huh!)
Skydiving, hoping my pilot land and my 'chute is good
And my show went well and my cheque about to go to the hood
If I die before I can make change, 'least I made a tape
And I pray someday you're inspired by it and make your way, look
It's some legends gone so I'm paying homage, they paved the way
And them stars aligned, I know they be on, I bet they in space
I might buy a trailer, we taking this bitch across the states (Sab!)
All aboard, it's just like the Green Line, we finally off the train
Sole heir to the booth, you can let the fans take a vote
Get the bread, then take a loaf
I just put the work in then take a load, off
Gotta butter bread like some toast
Wrote a bucket list and approached
Then they said that one, like my last one
And they been waiting since my last one and look what happened, yeah, ay
'Cause I meant it, if I doubt it, then I did it
If I caught it, then I dish it, how I started, how I finish
Show a hater, that impossible's what we major
I cross another one off that paper, 'causeI don't believe in that caper

Ay, I come from the bottom but a nigga feeling grateful
My life wasn't fatal, swear I must got angels
I know that the sun'll come up any time the rain go
I been in the rain though, they said what I can't do
I come from the bottom but a nigga feeling grateful
My life wasn't fatal, swear I must got angels
I know that the sun'll come up any time the rain go
I been in the rain though, they said what I can't do
(Huh!)

I'm mountain climbing that's never seen on this part of town
Hot air balloon on my wedding day getting off the ground
If I'm back at school, shit I'll commute maybe try to dorm
Just wrote a book on how not to fit into social norms
I ain't never smoke, fuck it? Why not? Guess I'm trying pot
Might just say, "Fuck it," get my hair cut and say bye to locks
Yeah, yeah, this for all of my hood homies
Fuck, give in, it feel good don't it
Look at all the shit you accomplished

Heard money make the world go round
Thirsty for it, hope you don't drown
I believe it, do not doubt
Head high, no, not down (Sab!)
Yeah, thinking outside them squares
Whole world know what it is
Scratching off my bucket list

Ay, I come from the bottom but a nigga feeling grateful
My life wasn't fatal, swear I must got angels
I know that the sun'll come up any time the rain go
I been in the rain though, they said what I can't do
I come from the bottom but a nigga feeling grateful
My life wasn't fatal, swear I must got angels
I know that the sun'll come up any time the rain go
I been in the rain though, they said what I can't do (Oh!)

[Matthew Santos:]
I got a gift to give
Just like this life we're living
Only a flash across the sky
Just an increment of time
What will you do with yours? Oh
I know what to do with mine
Even when the lights go out
Still they never die

Hmm, alright, I knew you was gonna hit me up or whatever 'cause I know you miss me. You already know who this is. It's your ex or whatever. I ain't finna' say my name for these thirsty ass b-(bleep) but I'm gon' give you my bucket list and it consists of beating your motherf-(bleep) ass, fina-fucking-lly, with your ugly ass

// American Hypnosis //

[Saba:]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ahem!
Huh, ah, ah

Ah, American hypnotize, been sad since about '09
Was scared of shit in my mind, now I smile in my pic's online
Isolation taught me patience 'bout the way to go
Had to learn my mama depression wasn't my own
Had to feel the pressures of the pessimism
Trying to convince me that realism was a better vision
Never been accepted in the ghetto, but I'm on Division
And I'm livin', inability to be myself in a room full of niggas
Focused on hittin stains and gettin' bitches
I don't speak, I'm silent as a mouse by my own house
With a bit of bitterness, worried about fittin' in
And my uncle in the pen taught me how to be a man
But he failed to mention why he did what he did
Why my dad had to dip 'fore I learned how to tie my sneakers?
While my mama boyfriend think he hiding the fact he sell reefer
We was kids, that ain't mean we was stupid
First time I'd seen a gun, thinking if he'd shoot it
Shotgun in my mama mouth, please don't do it
She ran home naked and came right to us
And I go to school the next day like ain't shit happen, excelled in great grades and they ain't matter
Standardized tests educate data
You love the hype shit, but they ain't Saba
You ain't seen addicts until my family
Granny lost her brother, her other brother, her daddy
You wonder why I don't drink, wonder why I don't smoke
Wonder why I don't live, wonder why I'm so gray
Wonder what's a fun night, waiting for the punchlines
Want the beat quantized, you should play some other shit
Nigga, we was traumatized, you talkin' 'bout the government?
Had to get my ass whooped, fight's how we settle it
I wish I didn't have to be famous to be important
I used to wish that my parents could keep it cordial
I hated my life until I played the piano
They raided my best friend, he red-handed
Scene of this shit like a scene of a movie
Meanwhile, I'm the kid in the private schooling
Wearing my glasses, playing my computer
Drawing cartoons, was a straight-A student
On a scholarship and I hated that
Left the hood, somehow I made it back

[Akenya:]
Back to life, back to reality
Will my life, ever belong to me?
Hypothesize the definition of free
Realize this dream wasn't meant to be

[Voicemail - Saba's father:]
Hey, boss, how ya doin'? It's Pops, here's my bucket list; it's pretty short. I want us to go see Vatican City, I wanna go see Mecca, I wanna visit Israel, I wanna visit Morocco, I wanna see the Egyptian pyramids, the Mayan pyramids in South America. But most importantly, what I'm saying is that I want us to all do this together. I'm proud of you, man. Peace

[Saba and Akenya:]
I too am an American dreamer
I too dream of American freedom
I too sing an American plea
I too scream 'til liberty rings and

I too am an American dreamer
I too dream of American freedom
I too sing an American plea
I too scream 'til liberty rings and

I too am an American dreamer

// California //

[Saba & Ravyn Lenae:]
See the horizon from the road, and hope that we drove... the right direction
'Cause I don't wanna slow... down for no gas
And plus I'm runnin' low on cash
But I know that my bucket gon' make it to California, California
Hmmm mm mm Cali, Cali

[Saba:]
What does love look like in the 22nd century? Merely a memory
I intervene cause I tend to be a lil' more optimistic than the wildest child or the most imaginative
I sip the tea after my opinion
They Pistol Pete, dishin' out assistance
Government aid, what does it take
To break the mold, ay I hate the po'
Like the base is low, but I'm out the park
Like the acre gone
Saba with the sabre sword
Focusin' on what we can't afford
In the scheme of things, guess it just ain't important
Who wasn't broke for a moment or three
Start staining like, "oh it was free"
Then stop for a moment of peace
And plus they would call the police if you kept showin' ya face
I said I stopped dreamin', instead I decided to chase
And I ain't look back, that's how you turn to stone
My first friend up in high school was a Stone
He said come and join, I ain't come along
Not cause I'm high and mighty, just cause I knew right from wrong
Somewhere I belong, looked but I didn't find
But instead of getting discouraged I got my city behind
Now I'm feelin' worldwide, next stop NY
Next month LA, then back West Side
You change when a friend dies, new man since I lost Kobe
He got out of prison then called my phone like, "where ComfortZone?"
And since then I lost touch, but this year I'm gettin' it back
I finally feel like myself, what I've been on, don't even ask
They ask me "why the Bucket List?"
You know the bucket list, I finally climbed the rock, made it to the top of the precipice
I came from the pessimism of inner city as it is
Accident prone youth, adult say don't take a chance
But we never listen, we went and did it, they vision impaired
So what do you fear, and why are you scared?
Why are you scared?
Why are you scared?

[Saba & Ravyn Lenae:]

[Lupe Fiasco:]
Yo yo yo what up? This is Lupe Fiasco
And my bucket list... has many things in it
One of 'em is uh, wantin' to win the Nobel Prize, for somethin'. Uhhhh, I also want... yeah that's it, I just wanna win the Nobel Prize
Yeah!

[Saba:]
House, in a gated neighborhood, not the hood, in the hills
Plus an ocean view, your wife and you is good
And your bills, ain't never stress you and you get karate lesson
Here's... to, no more tears

Look at what you done started?
Look at what you done started?
Lookin' at how you've gone, gone
Do you want a shooting star?
Look at what you done started?
Look at what you done started?
Lookin' at how you've gone, gone
You can leave it runnin'...

Yo yo yo, shoutout to my boy Saba, man. It's ya boy Donterio Hundon, man. Ya know I fuck with ya bro, but I gotta bake anotha one, on baby.

// World In My Hands //

[Saba:]
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
The world in my hands, the world in my hands

The world in my palm like it's pomade
Cheering like they got pom poms on
And I document it, put it on page
Flipped it on em, I swanton bombed
And she say that she saw me on prime time
Stock going up draft combine
I don't wanna hear about the bullshit, I could write a full book
How you only keep it real sometimes
Sometimes I wonder what my life would be like if I didn't try to take my whole life and put it in writing
Put it on wax to play while you drive
I was on the bus with it
Just went to Manhattan on a bus ticket
Y'all still did everything but listen
Now they tryna sign like a petition, submission
How I got the game in a choke hold
Knew my day would come, it was foretold
I've been focusing on keeping my balance
Like I had a couple drinks in the cup-holder
I ain't worried bout your boys moving backwards
Just the forward, 3 Man weave just the forwards
Justified, side by side, juxtaposed, jumping out
Just to show you

The world in my hands, the world in my hands
(Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
(Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
The world in my hands, the world in my hands

Hey! Look, they trafficking, they don't got crossing guards
We hope to die, we just cross our hearts
Reader's digest, I got food for thought
From where they keep pack like they move a lot
I was a diamond in the rough but rough was more literal
Now I kill with the literary, just drop it on em like litterers
I just put my life in some literature... like literally!
I can't hold it, I feel all of it
The police targeted, like I'm shoppin
Want my albums posthumous, no fraudulent
Gas like flatulence, hoe I feel fabulous
I'm fathering all these styles I hit, then they copy it
You know I ain't worried bout that though (about that though)
Look how they react when I'm back home (when I'm back home)
I could turn the trap to a castle (to a castle)
Still yellin' bitch mob task force (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
In my vans, mobbin' through France
Got my name up on my jersey with the world in my hands

The world in my hands, the world in my hands
(Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
(Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
The world in my hands, the world in my hands

[LeGit & Saba:]
Daydreamin' its real when we wake up
Gave my all but can't say I gave up
They wonder what these dreams are made of
(Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)

[Smino:]
My beautiful dark twisted fanta-leaf
Burn like the pain when you see me grow
Yeah yeah it's that same old negro
Crazy how now this weed shit legal
Bro mainpassion was the profit
Got to moving trees, like the breeze, only two-piece default
Judge slammed the gavel and he gone
Good man need a lil' more tryna feed his people
Screaming reparations, 'till my respiration meet the expiration, uh
No ain't no rush lil' bitch, I got patience
Doctor the blunt, goddamn me I'm waiting
With the wind in my hand, ay, grinning like damn
Fresh linen, lining flicking like Teanna Trump damn, ay
A town stomp Fuck Trump, chunk
St. Lou taught me never front, stunt
Dave Mirra bring it bike on em, they been feeling dead dripping life on em
On your... head, turn to lice on em
Come to... bread, need a high quota
On a... quest for my lil' niggas
Gotta get 'em back, turn the Phife on em

[Saba:]
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
(Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
The world in my hands, the world in my hands
(Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh oh)
The world in my hands, the world in my hands

[LeGit & Saba:]
Daydreamin' its real when we wake up
Gave my all but can't say I gave up
