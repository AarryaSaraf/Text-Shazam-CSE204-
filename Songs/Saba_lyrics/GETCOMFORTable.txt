// Rap Dollar$ //

[Saba:]
I'm that loser that they let sit with the cool kids
This my past on a record, and I reckon like a western film
Like Lazarus, I resurrected rap. Clear?
Like resuscitation, bro I brought it back
To Life, To Light
Till I die my hair turning gray
My bills never paid on time
This the life that I chose
Getting choked up on the stage at 15
Is this really your scene?
While Pops was singing
While Mom unemployed
Why Uncle locked up?
We on Massasoit
With a 4-track and more raps
And more rats in the basement
I wish I could build me a spaceship and fly
Towards them

Rap Dollars
Rap Dollars
Rap Dollars
Rap Dollars

Say, did that blog post you?
Pro tool, hard work paying off
With a call from an A and R
And a coffin to your old life
And the cause of death's a larger check
Doctor check his pulse, is he ok?
Or is he too far gone?...
The Drake
The traits
That he got from his pop got him popular
He popping now, consider dropping out
Cause school the opps
With no illusion, all these obstacles is optical
The sight 20-20, if I ain't on when I hit 20
Are you still rocking with me?
That's all I ask
That's my concern
See me to my turn
Bandwagon bad rappers
You can see my gift, like a bad wrapper
Sab fans is family
This for grammys and them

Rap Dollars

[Saba & Jean Deaux:]

Who always had to hustle hard
This all we know
This all we are

This for all of y'all
Who always had to hustle hard
This all we know

This for all of y'all
Who always had to hustle hard
This all we know

When I turn 18, first thing I'mma do is buy a pack of squares
I never smoked before, so why not get prepared
For the real world, that my teacher keep talkin bout?
I'm trying to buy a planet, she talking bout a house
Fortune 500, y'all buying vowels
And eyeing spouses, but I ain't bout that
I'm about to blow up
And they'll just be like so uh...
Remember me from high school?
No actually I do not (no)
We all wanted real jobs
And lil nigga you thought you was 2Pac
But the days at Joes is long gone (long gone)
And I got my own songs (own songs)
Turned it into a mixtape
And stepped outside of my comfort zone
Like the black pinocchio just tryna be a real nigga
Oxycontin picking popping, I'mma field nigga
Cold as hell oxymoron
I see dead people, Shyamalan
You think you'll blow, you atom bomb?
You epic fail. You babylon
You out ya mind
And you need to be in it
So here take this joint and sip this liquor
Listen to your counselor cancel your dream
And tell you everything that impossible
Even if you believe
And you conform like a bitch
Wear your uniform to the stitch
Oh your favorite player was Tmac?
Impossible don't exist?
Remember that?
Bravo bravo, give him a clap
Encore encore when he end his act
Download download if he in a rap
With utmost respect, better tilt a hat
Kill a track
Condolences
Doberman doggin
No folding, I'm all in
Badu, I'm evolving
Til school year next august
Hopefully by then I'll be talking
You are in
Comfort Zone

// ThasMahWurrdd //

Goddamn, they racing for me like Project Gotham
Goddamn, like Gotham, flow is so Arkham
All in, I keep it so card deck, all that
Word to Amanda, I'm a man of my word
Demanding like the Comcast channel till I land in the dirt
The girl you 'bout to make your family is a fan of my work
You wife her, she five feet like Pfeiffer, she probably pied piper
You talking 'bout you a dog, she took lichen like I'm a liker
I just hit her with a "hi there" like an infant on my high chair
My high stool, take notes like this high school
This how you lose, or loser, your flow is ass like a puter
No computer blue, but prince and a stu
Heir to the throne, lion king two
I don't even know what y'all on but call on me
I'm a ghostbuster when it's all on E
Tank on full like World War Three
Reload like Neyo, niggga, Matrix 3
Hate on me like clothes on back
All these sounds around like nigga bozo back
Punchline like he told jokes back
Y'all ain't ready for Pivot and my solo raps nigga

Word, word, tell em that's my word
Nigga this my year, check the calendar
Bro I been here, and y'all amateur
And I ain't going nowhere
And that's my word
Word, word, tell em that's my word
Nigga this my year, check the calendar
Bro I been here, and y'all amateur
And I ain't going nowhere
And that's my word

This that chump change, chum bucket
Bucket list, building castles in the sand, bucket shit
Shoveling, these tunes in my room
Looking for a couple cent
Couple dollar dollar bill, bar's hot
You ain't touching this with no oven mitt
Other than Mitt, who competition for a nigga?
I gladly inquire, the flow so godly I quiet choirs
My oh my like Maya, how I seat if I side her
Big globe, like The Rock, Wrestlemania
I'm against the rope
Putting my city on the map like a geographer
A lot of came and gone, these niggas trendy like Hollister
Holler at you when you up, if they caught it cause I'm just lobbing em
Lobby room, waited to long to sing my song like Solomon
So sayonara to the artist that gave his dream up
Let's do the hardship, but just hard shit, I'm bout to flood the streets up
No FEMA, yo femur, tell em just break a leg
Good luck if you bout that grind, with your almost famous ass

Word, word, tell em that's my word
Nigga this my year, check the calendar
Bro I been here, and y'all amateur
And I ain't going nowhere
And that's my word
Word, word, tell em that's my word
Nigga this my year, check the calendar
Bro I been here, and y'all amateur
And I ain't going nowhere
And that's my word

// KNOWING //

[Saba:]
Spray-painted BB guns in the Pentagon
Infiltrate, I'm making fart noises on the intercom
Since I got a little shine for making riddles rhyme
White girls sniffin' lines probably chillin' in the line
I'm in alignment with the universe, I'm feelin' fine
Niggas talkin' "get it, son," they ain't readin' what's in the fine
Print, but y'all ain't did to me like Diddy, Shyne
Cause I go in like indented lines, and it's dinner time
With my dogs like Adventure Time
Me and that nigga $ky control Medulla, feel it in you Fibula
They been saying they're going hard? Bull, still alive
Beat the track black and blue like "How the hell it still alive?"
Stealin' my style like "Sab, we rock similar."
Use Similac, sent it back like "I'm too grown." Simmer down
Taggin' they songs so it can come related
This for my dislikes, I hope you hate this

Keep it cool, come and knock, come along
This that calm before the storm
They on us 'til we at the top where we belong
They can sleep up or they be dawn
Keep it cool, come and knock, come along
This that calm before the storm
They on us 'til we at the top where we belong

[Martin $ky:]
A-plus, apex, predator to break necks
Haven't gone insane yet, rappin' on the same set
Backpack full of mild citrus for the session
Grabbed a couple blunts and proceeded to burn the essence
Far from being average, I'm an addict for this rap shit
Sat up in the back of the cab rollin' a fat spliff
Really be about it, you don't really be about shit
Closed circle, better watch the cash that you arrived with
Zoned out, vibing to this beat homie created
I ain't worried, we the greatest; it's getting easy to make hits
Sweet sixteens, punchlines: these are them basics
Them wack raps fill in the gaps, they close bases
No offense to those that don't notice
How my flow be the coldest, overdosing on dope shit
It would help you to notice things while I am present
Present rap killing, future rap legend

Keep it cool, come and knock, come along
This that calm before the storm
They on us 'til we at the top where we belong
They can sleep up or they be dawn
Keep it cool, come and knock, come along
This that calm before the storm
They on us 'til we at the top where we belong

// Reggie //

You smoking Reggie, that's that shit I don't like
But how you go your whole life
Just being content with alright
You're settling down to low grind
You smoking Reggie, that's that shit I don't like

While y'all was throwing kickbacks, I was throwing kickstarters
Like a thug in a party, I get shit started
Get a track I knock it out the field like I'm Glenn Barker
Boss dog like Cripwalkers, I lift often
So the bars must get lost, Saba on the up-and-up
Cooking like culinary amongst other stuff
Fuck with us, y'all ain't seeing my like crust
And I ain't sockin' with proof, Mekhi Phifer in booths
Pull all-nighters, I'm up in you -itis
I just hiatus'd and come again like a poo, like a poo
You 'bout to fall like ottomans, so, I call 'em ottomans
I'm laid back, my great raps gone change rap, that's all the man
Status, like go ahead and cast yo' vote
Too many average living comfortable with Reggie Smoke

You smoking Reggie, that's that shit I don't like
But how you go your whole life
Just being content with alright
You're settling down to low grind
You smoking Reggie, that's that shit I don't like

While y'all was thinkin' MySpace, I was thinkin' Instagram
I been a man and that's why listeners is instant fans
Records 'bout to pop, explode like kicking cans
They hear me rap and grab the 'saurus, look for synonyms
Bite me like Bart, bars out the ass
That's like a fart, simply put: I'm passin' gas
Got Reginald on a pedestal
For cheap highs, blink eyes, dreams they selling you
Lies; cheating wives, this unfaithful shit
Laker shit, how I play to win
You grind regular, you know I'm a bro
Serving like cornico-; I could teach you, I was born a coach
First class rap and you aren't a coach
It's only sad that you cool with it
If they smoke Reggie, I bet you hit it

You smoking Reggie, that's that shit I don't like
But how you go your whole life
Just being content with alright
You're settling down to low grind
You smoking Reggie, that's that shit I don't like

// Believe.The.Hype //

Ah
Saved up enough, now it's time to spend some
Records in my archive, gone spin one
Say Saba gone head spit some
Zone in ya eardrum
Classy like pin-up
Since the last classic dropped
It's been a minute
But there isn't a comparison
So there is no resemblence
Enter this my entrance like titantron
My mind is gone
If I was you, I'd be alarmed like early morning
This the part where I go
Mayhem cause I'm back with a vengeance
Like revengers
Payback from a young prince
Nigga hum this tune on the moon
Cause even on mute, you hear it
Lyrics reach out and touch your spirit
Like a poltergiest
How I approach the mic
Yeah it's awfully nice
How this author writes
I'm authority so I authorize
Eye open, Eye closing
Emoticon, semi colon
Semi holding fire haulted
I'm reloading, this my hoalster
Off the track Locamotive
They awfully trash Get the chores done
They have no bars they got lawyers
This that new kid that's a nuisance
Took all your fans, boy that boy good
Encore, clapping nolia
I'm annoying I'm anointed
Higher up, my bars are bouyant
Crept up like a voyeur
Bon voyage from the PIVOT squad
Got em all yelling sabotage
What's the odds that I make it?
Slim to none so I get it done
Hit and run, there's another hit
Like relationship of battered wives
You keep coming back don't you?
I make you want to
You repeat it like old news
So show me love
Any problem coming up
Know we nip it in the bud
And you gone worry, don't worry bout us
Tell em everything gravy nigga
Mashed potato ah

So show me love
Any problem coming up
Know we nip it in the bud
And you gone worry, don't worry bout us
How we coming up
We'll be on the top soon enough

So show me love
Any problem coming up
Know we nip it in the bud
And you gone worry, don't worry bout us
How we coming up
We'll be on the top soon enough

// Last. Week's. Paper. //

These thoughts of mansions, they dreaming
At high school campus I'm saving for new equipment
My man saving for pampers, shirts
Selling, dreaming of pamphlet like this can't be life
This can't be life

I'm in the hood like I'm Eric Wright in 85
I'm too prudent, straight A student
Hang with hoodlums and niggas with no future
And I mute it like Bermuda
Kept [?]
Some niggas want me dead and others want me famous
And I don't even care, I carry kerosene
Straight flame, I paint a page
Ladies call me mean cause I don't speak
Ain' that my ways, I'm a shy guy
Waiting to elope with Lois Lane
But I'm not Superman, I'm a super lame
[?] move quiet, Earth God, how I'm on the ink
Really a thug in a nerd's body, in search of shrink
My head big and it's filled up with fallacies
Hood teach the opposite that school do, which to use
All my mutual friends through FB comment on my Youtube
Like yo you rap ain't know you do that, but like who you 'pposed to be
Lupe or something, is you getting paid or something
You doing big, nigga you think you faith or something
They say the name says, I'm perfectly fine
Shante called me Saba for the first time
That name spread around the school like a rumor
Got a new nickname so now I am cooler
Don't do my homework I cheat off the white kids
Still in my honors, I'm still in my honest, mama grown
Paid college, long as daddy on the dial tone
My uncle got locked up they took him out of my home
My stepfather was shot and bled right around the corner
Got in his car like nothing happened and got my mom
Got a paper due, Imma write it in homeroom
Hard to do work at home when I don't have my own room

These thoughts of mansions, they dreaming
At high school campus I'm saving for new equipment
My man saving for pampers, shirts
Selling, dreaming of pamphlet like this can't be life
This can't be life

They set traps and they call em traps and we fall for it
Free the guys
They just want dough, then pizza pies
Move through the city gotta keep it tough
If niggas want beef, then pizza puffs
But I oughta go dumb and you never will know
These niggas stay ready to blow
They more true to that then they are to they denim
These niggas is strapped like gibeau's
My niggas is trapped in a box
Protect yo soul like thick socks
My wrist watch go tick-tock
I tell them hoes to kick rocks
Fuck thirst traps, I pick locks & purse snatch
The midnight marauder
And pray to the Rock of Gibraltar
And prolly end up as a martyr
We parlay with all of these people
My niggas will prolly end up in yo daughter

Look at my city and tell me that shit look pretty
The southside is like a blemish, like country breakfast is gritty, ah
But everything is ivory
I feel like Indi-ah

[Saba:]

From the kindergarten to the third grade
To the graveyard shift to the graveyard
But you don't wanna be like they are
When you in they heart, cause you on they hearts
Cus yo face on it, spray paint on it
You talking about a break no graffiti
We talkin about a war peace treaty
We gettin paid in full so we eatin
And we bump on GZC
And yell: FREE MY NIGGAS THAT'S LOCKED UP!
FREE MY NIGGAS THAT'S TRAPPED TOO!
Ay life's been a hassle since we turned our tassel
But I'm free man, free man
My own boss, I'm freelance
Ain't worried bout finance, cause we mobbin like vinance
Micheal Scofield, prison break on a break
Like I'm car stoppin I'm bar hopin'
Obviously I'm Paul Bunyan with lumber
Jack in a jacket, like cindy
Heat up like a hemi, heat up like I'm Penny
Hardaway to stay warm
The block is hot, the Wayne song
The block is hot, the napalm
The block will block ya one shot
Mutombo, you ball on blocks
You get dropped like a fumble nigga
You ain't heard the news better run lil nigga
Explicit, uncensored
So I don't need your opinion

[Mick Jenkins & Saba:]

Frsh Waters man, a whole lotta splashing on yo daughters

Still can't pinpoint the next checkpoint
Free

// FireDRILL (Interlude) //

The capital lies
Uncapital
Bang like Capon, this ain't no test run
(Fuck you looking at nigga)
(Get me out your stuff)

Filling feeling
It fits one
The fire drill

// Est. N19g4 //

[Saba:]
Ah
Boy I'm riding with my niggas though
Come through like we royalty in purple, that's that indigo
Hitting blocks till in the store
Such N Such, Save Mula
Saba saying PIVOT though, Pivotal
That's enough hang it up, Mistletoe
They say you judged by the company you keep
Oh well word? Well I'm with real niggas, what do that make me?
Exactly, to a tee. That description is vivid
A product of my environment
Surrounded by the illest, PIVOT
Get ya muscle up, bodybuilder, Arnold
Louie how my Arms strong
Go in like a hard on
My flow hard core
Arkham asylum psychotic cottonmouth rhyming
With no prescription so I'm in
A straight jacket, beat jacking
And dreams valid
Boy I'm fleetwood mack
Yeah, the man with the plan like the blueprints
Beat the beat with two fist
Don't play with em
Or ya fam in all black, no racism
Classical raps, I'm holding beethoven staff sheet
With an orchestra, yeah Saba leading the band geeks
Like Jimmy Jones fill your cups up with juices
The leader of the new school and y'all dudes too truant boy

[Jean Deaux:]
Okay now
We got something all of y'all want
I'd like this time to propose a toast
For my niggas
This for my niggas

Showcasing talents for the streets like a charity
And all of the proceeds
To my niggas
This for my niggas

[Saba:]
Uhhhhhh...
I'm looking to buzz
Your girl looking for love
And she looking at us
You looking around
As if it ain't such
Such N Such saving it up
You spending it all
Get played like you dumb
But nigga you say she the one
My niggas above
More than just a rim
Like 2Pac Shakur
That 1994 hit
My bars at your forehead
Foreshadowing the scene
Just know there'll be more dead
I'm counting casualties casually
Kill a bad emcee
I'm the sun to an asterisk
So y'all shine in the back of me
Like shadow clones
You never coming out like battered homes
My flow the cleanest, get my lather on
Yeah I scrub-a-dub
With Such N Such
And Jean Deaux, nigga that's the cause
And it's for the love
Like a bone thug
And I ain't on time
But I showed up with my niggas

[Jean Deaux:]
Okay now
We got something all of y'all want
I'd like this time to propose a toast
For my niggas
This for my niggas

Showcasing talents for the streets like a charity
And all of the proceeds
To my niggas
This for my niggas

[Saba:]
Ah
Strictly for my niggas, Pac in '93 Find me
Cotton picking, no pot to piss in, that's what the alley for
Locked behind padded walls and a padded door
That's a small circle so I had to add some more
Cause y'all my niggas (niggas)
Yeah this for all my niggas (nigga)
Change the vocab in one night (one night)
Y'all might all be right
Hey!

[Saba & Jean Deaux:]
But we'll never go away (way)
Never go away (way)
Never go away (way)
Never go

// You.Know.Sab. //

You know Sab, you know Sab, you know Sab nigga
You know Sab nigga

Back from the dead, with raps in my head
I got bass in my veins, spilling out like a keg
It's a party over here, it's a party over here
Y'all be making noise we don't hardly get to hear
Let the track bang like an onomatopoeia
Tell em Pivot Gang, that's who all of us are with
And they analyze, like they on an antelope
Mister no surprise, got up and did ya like a horoscope
Bout to draw like I'm Anakin, a mannequin, nigga be still
Like Barry Manilo with the piano, got the crowd like damn I'm dope
They know

You know Sab, you know Sab, you know Sab
You know Sab, you know Sab
You know Sab, you know Sab, you know Sab
You know Sab, you know Sab
You know, you know, if you don't then you will
You know Sab, you know Sab, you know Sab
You know, you know, if you don't then you will
You know Sab, you know Sab, you know Sab

Boy I thought you knew, boy I thought you knew
This ain't nothing new, like sequel
Picked up where I left off, I resume
Like Loon, getting played by Puff
My competition keep coming short like they name Mugsy
I be, nigga I be real, Chicago you find me still
Tell the world I'm on my grind
Like a rail between my wheels
I been up since three AM
Who the best here, you say him
All fingers will aim at me, even if there's hate in here
So how the audience, got all my colleagues pissed
Cause I built what I dreamed of, like Walter E Smith
Russian roulette, throwing shots, smithereens how I leave tracks
Thought I put you up on game like nigga you ain't up on that
You know Sab

You know Sab, you know Sab, you know Sab
You know Sab, you know Sab
You know Sab, you know Sab, you know Sab
You know Sab, you know Sab
You know, you know, if you don't then you will
You know Sab, you know Sab, you know Sab
You know, you know, if you don't then you will
You know Sab, you know Sab, you know Sab

So they missed out, let me fill em in
I'm currently pivoting
Nigga I'm the man, I'm kinda sand
You look up to me and I condescend
Your notebook, all stole from me
You ain't got bars, you got contraband
Nigga play my cards right, I got the hot hand
Niggas top ten and I ain't got to beat you there
Cause I'm already sand
I got a big head, quite obviously and
I'm that nigga, yeah I'm that nigga
You know Sab, you know Sab, you know Sab nigga

// Adderall //

Ah Another one of those nights
You know the ones when your eyes don't close at all
I just got done recording
And this girl want me over
But my grade can't afford it
So I'll pass so I can pass
Just last week seven hours of sleep
And that was in total
They party hard and hardly nod
And they yell out YOLO
Ha, but man I hope the next day don't stress me
But I swear to God if my teacher test me

(Contains sample from Juicy J "We Trippy")
I'll be
(At your local college baggy full of adderall, so trippy)
You know I'll be

Ah
My to-do list is like an encyclopedia
I need something to keep me up, for real
Cause Red Bull no longer gives me wings
And mommy sings me lullabies and they don't put me to sleep
It's time for bed, my eyes are red
And low, so why don't you go?
I'm like I got a show
And all my dreams no longer real to me
So that pill just appeal to me
At any given time though, I'd rather be up than sleep
So I'll be

(Contains sample from Juicy J "We Trippy")

// Matilda //

[Joseph Chilliams:]
Get caught up in a reflection like Narcissus
My heart is like waves with a part in it
You should brush up on it
Get familiar, Joseph Chilliams kill ya
Yes he can, like Bob builder
Firearm wielder, with a pen in my hand
My thoughts move you like Matilda
Perform voodoo with diction
The one that flew over the cuckoo's nest like chickens
Am I sensing resentment? Well stop watching the lifetime channel
Cause this here is primetime ammo
Like Janet, and the tit seen around the planet
Get to know, like Bobby Brown and blow
Everybody knows, like I'm in the garden growing vegetables
Cause it shows, like I bruise easily
Losings predetermined if we need to vis-Ã -vis
The unflappable vanguard
You already know it, fucking with me, you better come hard (no homo)
Maybe that was out of order
Like this whole courtroom, but there is no justice it's just us
Brother
Black exploitation like the undercover brothers

[Saba:]
Get caught up in a reflection like kiddy pools
My art is like the babes in the video
You ain't touching me (bounce that ass)
Get comfortable, class in session like summer school
I'm the last one standing like royal rumbles with 100 dudes
So who's that? You got a hunch or two?
I'm back like the hunchback after 300 lose (spartans)
King Leonidas, I'm on top of my flow like Poseidon
Pissing on everything in the water coming through
So find me, with a gun and [?]
Bombing bodies at parties for nothing, just because it's fun to you
So turn up, turn up
Ain't no telling where you turn up, on the furniture or furnace
Burn ya, iron and scorch and abort this mission
I'm sick of this like Aborigine must be pissed with location switching
Radio station switching, please do not play that here man
I bet they pay to see me, remake a pay for CD's
Like screw your internet and your cable, push it to the max like beta
So I Dreamcast like a forecast, nigga it don't rain it's Sega
Vincent Vega, your diction is fiction
I send it to you like my curtain then burp like I'm finished with him
Me and your girl bump and grind like a pendulum nigga

Back up in that ass
For the 9 dre
Aftermath production
Motherfucker
PIVOT!

// Stay Awhile //

Grind time now, like rap battles
Killing a sonic wave, I'm shadow
An adult amongst children
Bout to take it home like bone thugs and phil nigga
Feel me, like 2pac in the passenger
I'm probably a massacre just waiting to happen
Procrastinating my rap career like are we on yet
These niggas ready for you to drop COMFORTZone yet
No, didn't think it, until then it's faith
Just shit on everything, I hope that everybody sees it
They take your dream and seize it, like a cellphone in class
But this the return of the real, like an alarm clock
Sab you woke em up, Sab you woke em up
No more tip-toeing in fear of a bang
They fearing a gang, and that is us
Don't talk to me about who doing what
Unless you talking bout getting change, and I don't give no fucks
Y'all to busy joking, y'all to busy riddler
So two face is next, but we breaking necks
Just keep them little niggas from round me
Or they'll be paralyzed with a new pair of eyes
They never saw this happen
I never saw this happen
Me and [?] smoking in the basement and all we doing is rapping
That nigga started trapping, but I'm too focused, I'm too focused
Now these words at you nigga, I'm too kosh
God forbid that Chicago back around
And now y'all can't come back around
By definition I'm a builder, I'm a make it
With my feet all on the couch like I stay here

Stay awhile, don't go
Stay up while you on
Just get your foot past the door
Now relax, get comfortable
Stay awhile, stay awhile, stay awhile, stay awhile
Stay awhile
Stay awhile, stay awhile, stay awhile, stay awhile
Stay awhile

My time now, get used to me
I'm only writing a eulogy
Like what's a verse, I'm only writing a hearse
Park on Park avenue, on Hearse, no rehearsal, I'm too loud
Uncle Lou, over heads like Duke, wrestle like [?] in a suit
Tell em rest in peace, this a funeral
Left all them old girls for some new ones
Like a sock in a socket I'm shocking who plugs
Keep your mouth closed, like halogen
While you in college course, they wanted like connoisseurs
I'm a course, the young man on his grizzly like Lionel Hollins
Cards is dealt then I'm all in nigga

Stay awhile, don't go
Stay up while you on
Just get your foot past the door
Now relax, get comfortable
Stay awhile, stay awhile, stay awhile, stay awhile
Stay awhile
Stay awhile, stay awhile, stay awhile, stay awhile
Stay awhile
