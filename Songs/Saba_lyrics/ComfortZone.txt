// Time Zone //

All these niggas know
Since a shorty I've been showin' how I'm different
All these niggas know
Nigganigganigga Niggas know h-how I'm different

Who do you wanna be like?
Who do you picture me like?
What will I be when I grow up?
Cause I never wanted to be like them
These niggas never seen me shine nah
And I'm sorry for the me time ya'll
I just had to get my mind right
So now we can move on right

First things first realest niggas move in silence
I been quiet, I'm a cotton picker pioneer my mommy had a bias
To a pint of hen apologies, y'all ain't hear
Y'all ain't near and dear to me like William and Hillary
My will will read everything to y'all
And I ain't even dying still it's everything to y'all
Take my heart, take the loss of your brother
To the court system order in it, order y'all to yada yada shut the fuck up (would ya)

I've been on Adderall too long cause it's feelin' like the same day
Hourglass, sand will pass, that look like the same grain
What's your timezone, is your time gone without living?

Who do you wanna be like?
Who do you picture me like?
What will I be when I grow up?
Cause I never wanted to be like them
These niggas never seen me shine nah
And I'm sorry for the me time ya'll
I just had to get my mind right
So now we can move on right

All the kids I graduated with waiting for my major hit
Disregard my shows until I main event
Till I stadium I'mma stay working Stayin' in
Fuck Imma go out for? fuck if you ain't 'bout yours
I just popped a pill, feel invincible
Feelin' like the motherfuckin' GOAT and I'm about to milk the game
Like I'm Game in 05, till it's dry I'm alive
And I know it make it bleed, if I wrote it, I been on it nigga

I've been on Adderall too long cause it's feelin' like the same day
Hourglass, sand will pass, that look like the same grain
What's your timezone, is your time gone without living?

Who do you wanna be like?
Who do you picture me like?
What will I be when I grow up?
Cause I never wanted to be like them
These niggas never seen me shine nah
And I'm sorry for the me time ya'll
I just had to get my mind right
So now we can move on right

All these niggas know
Since a shorty I've been showin' how I'm different
All these niggas know
Nigganigganigga Niggas know h-how I'm different

// Burnout //

[Saba:]
My grandad adamant about Adam and evil
How after the show in the back it's a Katt Stacks dyin' to meet you
I wanna rap with the Beatles, I just wanna rap like the Beatles
On the road to success caught a detour, picture me tourin' in England
I got stranded in Englewood outside of this chick's house
And since then I ain't ever really been south
Bench press bird shit, chess nerd kiss ass your distanced
From the rest of the world it's hardly normal, I only party formal
I'm on mute with no remote, so I don't talk much
And the land is lawless like they theme music on cassette
Yellow tapes say caution caucus I owe a lot to it though
Seen a guy on a bus ride, he'll probably die doin' dope
Seen a group of girls and they were callin' on the Lord, like may he be witch you
In Armageddon I'mma be a nigga with a sword, like Mace Windu
Bullet, went through they window, like that was a close call so
What if it's your fault, do-do-don't let them catch you sleep and doze off

[Eryn Allen Kane:]
Hey universe, don't come at me with your bullshit
Your nonsense, your issues, can't handle it
These problems keep me up at night
But in the end there just problems and everybody got some, right?
Shut up, shut up, don't nobody want to hear that
Shut up, shut up, don't nobody want to hear that
I'm right here, we burnup
Pull the windows down and roll out

[Saba:]
Crashin' cars like burnout, I got burnout
So I dropped out, see I turned out okay
On the Holy Bible told a lie to teachers in the twelfth grade
On my entrance essay, I just want to live, find a college to attend
Get a pup and picket fence, stop the choosin' and just pick
In my head I keep a pic with a fist on the end
I got homies in the low, a momma on a hundred and something
I'm hella out west though, where the buses stop runnin' early
I used to run home, I was scared to walk, people bled at dark
It's funny we play with chalk, and then lay in chalk
Foreshadow the shadows, it's more cattle for tattles
It's beef or snakes with the rattle, they tryin' to dethrone your castle
I call it like a sportscaster with stats on tally and tackles
I told this lie for a white whore who thinks I'm a statistic
Bitch you hate your job, so fuck your condescendant, I got common sense
You got passed up like a close call, don't let them catch you sleep and doze off

[Eryn Allen Kane:]
Hey universe, don't come at me with your bullshit
Your nonsense, your issues, can't handle it
These problems keep me up at night
But in the end there just problems and everybody got some, right?
Shut up, shut up, don't nobody want to hear that
Shut up, shut up, don't nobody want to hear that
I'm right here, we burnup
Pull the windows down and roll out

[Saba & Eryn Allen Kane:]
Wake up, yeah wake up everyday feelin' good

I got up out of bed this morning feelin' like some butter
Toast up in my toaster or some waffles, boy whatever
Pick my nappy fro but boy I used to have 'em butters
Fuck the niggas that hate, tell 'em everything's great hey
Pardon my parkay, patient yeah I wait
Mature for our age, Daily's a parlay
We got here upon fate, Got in the door late
Cause I've been the best for two years now
Tell them dudes sit down I'mma do it how ever the
Fuck I want, fuck you thought?
Because you won, that we lost
Up and coming, that we are
Where I'm from bitch, that be Austin
You worried 'bout the wrong things, cause money can't buy you love
Or make your dreams come true, so I'm just Butter (butter)

Wake up every wake up everyday feelin' good
Wake up every wake up everyday feelin' good
Out of town, out of town homies showin love
Bump my new shit for my niggas in the hood

Out of town, out of town homies showin love
Bump my new shit for my niggas in the hood

[Jamila Woods:]
They love you
You're here
They hate you
Who cares?

[Saba:]
My father told me that the world was mine when I was five
Figured I could never fail in life so why not try?
To think of the impossible and bring that shit to life
Like why I need a job if all this shit already mine?
Steady vibes, and they are the good
Westside nigga, we all the hood
Still managed that honor roll
Still don't live by the books
And I get love from where you come from
I just come for all this comfort
Had this dream that I just conquered
It just dawned that I am Butter butter

Wake up every wake up everyday feelin' good
Wake up every wake up everyday feelin' good
Out of town, out of town homies showin love
Bump my new shit for my niggas in the hood

Wake up every wake up everyday feelin' good
Wake up every wake up everyday feelin' good
Out of town, out of town homies showin love
Bump my new shit for my niggas in the hood

Wake up every, wake up everyday feelin' good
Out of town, out of town homies show me love

[Jamila Woods:]
They love you
You're here
They hate you
Who cares?

// Welcome Home //

Yo Saba it's been a minute, you better, you benefited, is that what you thinkin' now?
The rapper you been committed, your woman she throwin' a fit like nigga you cheatin' now?
Just tell her keep it down, they try to take your dream and keep it down
I've been turnin' up like I beat the sound
I've been burnin' up if you do pounds
And my time is up I just mute the crowd
My nigga comin' home soon, he found
If you think you gettin' known soon, don't
I'm better than before
So where I'm gonna get my support at?
Where you go when you on your last?
The fam you actually had before rap
Welcome home a doormat, they all facts, tell 'em niggas

So where I'm gonna get my support at?
Where you go when you on your last?
The fam you actually had before rap
Welcome

Yo, I walked in Def Jam on my 19th birthday, I can't recall my 18th
Came a long way since the days where we strolled like we homeless and loitered on State Street
I just pray that you get home safely, ironically the green line trained me
Cause I was softer than cotton startin' college something that here you can't be
Can't see them niggas gettin' on no time soon, we worried 'bout survival out here
Like where the hell I'm gonna get my food, nigga fuck your song I don't care
So where I'm gonna get my support at?
Where you go when you on your last?
The fam you actually had before rap
Welcome home a doormat, they all facts, tell 'em niggas

So where I'm gonna get my support at?
Where you go when you on your last?
The fam you actually had before rap
Welcome

Pain make the best song, and the game made a stepson
But my heart can't be teflon, I feel everything and some
I got some issues and some, granny worried 'bout her grandson
I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing... nah

Pain make the best song, and the game made a stepson
But my heart can't be teflon, I feel everything and some
I got some issues and some, granny worried 'bout her grandson
I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing... nah

Pain make the best song, and the game made a stepson
But my heart can't be teflon, I feel everything and some
I got some issues and some, granny worried 'bout her grandson
I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing... nah

// 401K //

I ain't got no job
Young nigga, I ain't got no job
I trade a 401K for an AK
Cause when my vitals stop
Grind don't stop
The grind won't stop when my vitals stop
Mind on plot, so I don't talk
Trade a lifelong girl for a thot

Marathon, that's 4K
Some niggas sold they self for just 4K
I trade a 401K for an AK
And bet I'm not hungry the next day
They told my little homie "Crime pay"

And he got scolded the next day
He on parole for the next few
He older with the same case
Earned his stripes like he signed with Adidas
Trade a W9 for a.9 millimeter
All my niggas did time, and got beat up
But I was never street enough to grow up and be a thug
Because I went to school everyday
I went to school everyday
Learned shit don't matter, niggas shoot everyday
I had a 3.9 that shit didn't matter
What's a 401k?

Young nigga, I ain't got no job
I trade a 401k for a AK
Cause when my vitals stop
The grind don't stop
The grind won't stop 'cause when my vitals stop
Mind on plot, so I don't talk
Trade a lifelong girl for a thot, yap

Marathon, that's 4k
Some niggas sold they self for just 4k
I trade a 401k for a AK
And bet I'm not hungry the next day

GPA don't estimate shit
Money you make, not your class average
Cause niggas was so broke they couldn't afford schooling
How all them niggas get rich? (rich)
It seems like everybody trying to get a hold of me
But little do they know I'm barely holding like rosary
Before I'll be the success story I'm supposed to be
I'll probably end up on the news just so I eat
If I commit a crime would you love me still?
A refill if I'm empty, drugs hella temptin'
My girl just left me, told her I'm empty
Tell her I'm pimpin', her friend look temptin'

'Cause I ain't go no job
Young nigga, I ain't got no job
I trade a 401k for a AK
Cause when my vitals stop
The grind don't stop
The grind won't stop 'cause when my vitals stop
Mind on plot, so I don't talk
Trade a lifelong girl for a thot, yap

It's niggas trading shots over blocks
I'd rather trade blocks for some stock
I knew a homeless man stayed on my block
He'll trade everything he got for a rock
Fuck it I can not starve
Fuck it I can not starve
I'll trade an A&R for an AR
Cause fuck it I cannot starve

// For Y'all //

[Eryn Allen Kane & Saba:]
Ridin' 'til the sun up, runnin' into cover
This one for my brothers
Get up and get on it, not up for discussion
Don't waste your life on nothing
Remembering them all, if I'm living large
You are all the cause
This for you, this for you
This for y'all

[Saba:]
On my second bowl of cereal, second semester
Me and my classmates all on separate sections
City on the rise from decadent anthems
Funny they wanna see us all rot just
Drown out the ant farm, used to rock Phat Farm
Used to watch Cat Dog, now you a rap star
Cause the vocab was tough, head in the lap with a [?] up
From a mile away, still know that it's us
Clearly [?] enough
And I started hating this song while writin' it
She came to my crib and she leave with bites and shit
I can't even sleep in my bed
I still got degrees on my head
The temperature hot
I can't even leave, come out here one day go for 10 bucks a pop while my niggas get shot around here
Pound it, pound it, nigga show love to the coldest on the crow's nest
Solar system, pick my pen up been a loser been a winner
Pick my chin up, sky the limits, Silkk The Shocker, got no limit, limit
Lemon wedges in the water, we in the air but we ain't started, uh

[Eryn Allen Kane & Saba:]
Ridin' 'til the sun up, runnin' into cover
This one for my brothers

Don't waste your life on nothing

You are all the cause
This for you, this for you
This for y'all

[Saba:]
Young nerd Neutron, didn't fuck with my prom
But turned in writin' prompts, but grandma got a lawn
Uncle on lock, they probably scared I got a bong
But Jimmy good, he all straight
We know this nigga beatin' his case
I don't drink but I just may
Treat my homies to a case
Like how you innocent in inner city
They scared of you like Insidious city kid
City on the brink of extinction
And all we do is sing songs I see ya'll
Cause the funeral love the young brother who doesn't know better
But where is the hater that stay down when they actin' up in the first place
Worst case scenario we make it out alive and uninjured
Then that'll be news forreal because we not statistics
And it took eighteen years but he finally not scared to talk his shit
Still O.C. with it can't seem to control his fuckin' temper
And rap is just fuckin' templates, I can capture a couple pictures
Change the caption description and y'all still wanna look at him different
Instagram him and Twit pic, then ask the masses who this is
And I'll only get mentions, like that's the same exact nigga

[Eryn Allen Kane & Saba:]

[MC Tree:]
And even if we don't get rich up out up this bitch
We don't get ticks on Priceline quick
Enough to where they jump, way way up
And you can't afford the shit
We still gon' do it my nigga
We still gon'-still gon' screw on them bitches
A couple of pills if that what you into
If that what you into
I feel you, it's real, I think in my mental
It come out the deal, it's [?] what you [?]
I treat you like Blood
And I treat you like Cause, 'cause
Yo it's us and them, red stripes, on the corner every night
Argue though you dead right, and I'm dead wrong, no headlights
And them red lights behind us, they don't mean nothing as long as you don't, Go reachin' for something then give them a reason to shoot up the truck up
We get out, we runnin', we yellin' "yo fuck it"
Cause you supposed to be protectin' and servin' the public
And all of the ruckess
We stickin' together [?] out on your mothers
Say hi to your mama
And in the end though
I wanna see you in the endzone
Or a Benzo with the rims high
And the tint low cause you stayed down
Nigga ten toe, we like kinfolk
Bendo, on a bitch oh
Take turns like she a Nintendo
Understand me, 10-4
(Tree)

// Scum //

They call us scum, from the city slums and
They all think we idiot, like we

They call us scum, from the city slums and
They all think we idiot, like we really dumb
I pity them, the fool
Right to, free speech
Rifle, cheap drinks
Bible, we pray

Kill in Jesus name, kill people for a Jesus chain
For a fortune we'll change, can't afford to eat with change, real pain
Our tummy growlin', they money pilin', my mommy poutin'
Some of them doubtin', I don't
But it's funny how if it's money 'round then I loan
They closed the school that you went to
And told you that it's rent due, left potholes where you carpool
And caca on that carpet, Chi kids love startin' shit
I don't, there's no politics in my home

Cause they call us scum, from the city slums
And they all think we idiot, like we really dumb
I pity them, the fool
Right to, free speech
Rifle, Chief Keef
Bible, we pray

But kill in GD name, and get judge by our GPA
Shit if we don't like the same food, how they expect us to eat the same?
How learning different?
Burnin' bridges to earn a livin'
Raise your blood pressure, no tourniquet
But expect you can turn the cheek
Major turn of events when you turn eighteen
They kicked you out of your middle school, said your work was pitiful
Mama's loan didn't get approved
So you got a gun, lookin' just like them
Cause whether cap and gown or cappin' down ya called scum

Why they call us scum, from the city slums why
They all think we idiots, like we really dumb
I pity them, the fool
Right to, free speech
Rifle, cheap drinks
Bible, we pray

Feelin' regal in my old school regal
Listenin' to Segal with a couple of my amigos
They been speakin' about the evils of the Windy Coast
That's too many for me to mention, so hear a dose
Know a dab will do ya too much
Sab' will school ya not even gasin' him up
Each track hit harder than a Mack or a truck
You don't hear me though, my music too up, aquatic with the flow
Change seats, change cuts, this upholstery too much for a degenerate
Too much mixin' with the likes of [?]
Purple rain yo' broad
Take the game cause the player ain't do it
Schools closin', got the lady into it
King pin, light skin ain't men
Every time I hit the scene they say dark be the trend
Oblivious to the fact black have skin
You see people where I be seein' my twin
Too many losses got me focused on wins
Chuuch!

// Westside Bound //

[Saba:]
Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted
Westside rasied me I should get that shit tatted
Grabbing that knife you can be living and never get right
If you looking down how you put up a fight?
Pick your head up never let up never said once it was gon' be easy
Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted

Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted
President off a write ins they not even on the ballot
Spreading love like rotation I just pass it like in Cali
I been running rap so long damn my foot got a callus (Saba)
City cold think you need a coat but you really need a vest
Speak on if you blessed I'm coming for your heart like skeeting on your chest
Speak and need a technician upper deck
Tell em live and let listen never deaf
It's too many signs immma get it, on the road to success
Find a living limit pushing lemon pepper chicken
Linen thrift shop, keep it simple
Not expensive synonym of being broke is
I'm just getting by, but barely living
And these niggas wanna bite and burn Billy
And these labels call you how come [?]
But these niggas shady niggas shifty
You'll be gone in a year like you signed to Diddy
It is not a biggy it is natural
Niggas with me off a pack of loud
Split a bliggy down in [?]
Got me high off contact feeling dizzy
Dizzy Gillespie, Galactic the pepsi you cap in the pep
Keep [?] her has on the rapper ain't rapping
I happen to hate em' I wrap em' in plastic
And pack em' a [?] to Alaska frostbitten
Good riddance, Good riddance, I drop good writ-tens
This economy could kill em'
Pivot probably a killa
Hard work to the drug dealers
Parade daily that's Bud Billiken
Drop a tape and they lovin' it
It's in my genes my blood denim

Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted
Westside rasied me I should get that shit tatted
Grabbing that knife you can be living and never get right
If you looking down how you put up a fight?
Pick your head up never let up never said once it was gon' be easy
Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted

[Benjamin Earl Turner:]
Animal beats so I Dr. Doolittle them
My pseudonym is GYM
I stay working it out
Killing the fear and the doubt
People keep dying we keep buying the liquor just to pour it out
The earth is a drunk just spinning around
I'm bout to make skeletons come out the ground
Grabbing that life you can be living and never get right
If you looking down how you put up a fight?
Pick your head up never let up never said once it was gon' be easy
Cause a nigga with attitude a lil less scary than a man on a mission
With a real humble heart and a humble smile
And I'm painting this clear like a radiant child
Same old same old, but who could blame tho they know we don't know so educate
Just think about thinking pre-meditate then we don't have to let things escalate
Just move on up, elevate
I heard blacks got magic all in they blood
That's why they quick to shed it
Trying to fertilize they dust
And grow an empire off us
I'm bout to inspire an entire generation to combust
We are engine number 9 or number 6 what's the difference?
CoCo Loco motor movement too much into mangy music
With guitar and sunsets playing light tricks all up on our head rest
Headed out west for a remix revolution
I'm so poor that I swear peace and compassion at war
Who don't need sheep, no Basedgod but ain't it I
Buzz got the worlds eye Lil B

[Saba:]
Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted
Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted
(Get that shit tatted)
Grabbing that life you can be living and never get right
If you looking down how you put up a fight?
Pick your head up never let up never said once it was gon' be easy

// Whip (Areyoudown?) //

Seventeen livin' out a dream while these niggas want to sleep, sleep
Seventeen I'mma steal the keys while my mama go and sleep, sleep
Seventeen with a new love for the streets, streets
Seventeen hitin' seventy on the highway, highway
Cause you just want to see outside
But the bus don't run this late at night
Oh how lovely it'd be to take you for a ride
In the streetlight your face glows
Backin' out the driveway (driveway)
One hundred on a highway (highway)
A youngin' on a joy ride (joy ride)
And I hope that they don't find me (find me)
I know my mom will never find out (find out)
If she isn't awake by now (by now)
I'mma whip it 'til it's light out (light out)
Shit I just grabbed the keys like I'm out

And about in the whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip
Out in the whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip

Seventeen livin' out a dream while these niggas still sleep, sleep
Seventeen I'mma steal the keys while my mama go and sleep, sleep
Seventeen with a new love for the streets, streets
Seventeen hittin' seventy on the e-way, e-way
Backin' out the driveway (driveway)
One hundred on a highway (highway)
I whip it on a Wednesday (Wednesday)
Watch how I treat it like it's Friday (Friday)
A youngin' on a joy ride (joy ride)
Called my lady, I'mma slide, just enjoy the ride
I cannot complain with life since it's goin' right
But if we caught then we goin' down for the night
Her memory resemble the mileage
Don't let mama find out, she would trip about it
I went for a trip paid for by my allowance
I'm loud as a mouse then out the house
And I'm out on the town and I swear
I whip like I'm Kunta
That whip like too crucial
Cause you just want to see outside
But the bus don't run this late at night

Out in the whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip, whip
Are you down to trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip, trip

Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?

This is the one that they missed in from a young mystic
Gettin' busy cause I'm about business

Change the next day and now it's classmates wishing
For kisses like PDA
Stand on thin line like YouMedia
Came a long way since them hard ways
Now prolly sell out the venue if it's all age
And prolly like everyday holiday no off days
I forget I sleep when I'm dead and I don't plan on dying
City behind me like a predecessor better catch up know who next up
Better them them bitch it's our time
With them X's on your hand at the entrance ay?
Superhero shit the black (Finn & Jake)

What?
Bro, what are you talking about man?
Bro, I'm out man, ya'll niggas trippin'

Ah, ah, yeah
You can't get paid in a earth this big
You're worthless, kid

I was taught to love the enemy that's word sworn like a first born
And that grass grow from a dirt lawn
When daddy said he was leavin', did it hurt mom?
Wait, wait who the fuck is this new nigga on her arm?
They call him shorty I'm a shorty damn near his height
You get outta the car you hitchhike, you ain't ridin' with us
You can die my nigga, I don't care if I'm 5 my nigga
But everybody like you except me and you trynna accept me
Shit it would be easy if you bribed a nigga
Car tunes on masses so he turned to a vantage point
I just wanna see the world rotate
First time I saw the moon shine never stayed up so late
And we watched in a box while jumpin' in the bed in our socks
He pulls in the garage and he yells for Taj to come out
I, look around and go downstairs, 'cause even if I don't wanna go I know that my momma wouldn't allow it
Guess we ridin' around then
He took me to the store and told me that he got me
And then I started pickin' out shit, glass cut, inside Gold
And a sphere so it rolls, it looked like a bunch of globes

We're all formless
Shapeless, flowin'
Foreign orbit
Starlight, sparkle
Ancient fossil
Flaws with marbles

I guess I get to see the world rotate after all
The big one is my shooter, like he had to ball
Shorty is the man to me now, but we had it all
In front of El Grand he made a nigga take his jacket off
You owe him money, better have it all
'Cause you comin' with half, let's just say that that's something he won't have at all
For salary, people hustle like Cassidy
I just got a new Casio and a karaoke machine
Now he ain't have the law, but he just know the system
I line my marbles up and I can see the solar system
They think I'm playin' in the dirt, how naÃ¯ve
Got into my first fight, and he lost his front teeth
Shorty taught me a cool handshake and I thought we made it up
Got to high school and realized we was just shakin' up
I see my reflection when I look into the heavens
Marbles in my pocket while the sun is settin', settin'

We're all formless
Shapeless, flowin'
Foreign, orbit
Starlight, sparkle
Ancient fossil
Flaws with marbles

You can't get paid in this earth this big
You're worthless, kid
Time to take action, affirmative
No more games like refurbishin', uh
I'm only 9 but I'm turnin' 10
Bump, some alternative like
I ain't never heard of this, shorty let me burn the disk
Keepin' his head above water like he learned to swim
Of course that's when they tried to murder him
But I'm gracious, he took three, one grazed him
With his blood up on the pavement, he ain't fried he just bakin'
Never seemed like such a cake walk the walk
Makes his way to a car, he go to pick up my mom
Like heaven can wait
When you this big planets start look like marbles
Just pray they don't use the sun as a shooter

We're all formless
Shapeless, flowin'
Foreign, orbit
Starlight, sparkle
Ancient fossil
Flaws with marbles...

[Saba:]
Look, I'm ridin' like I fell in love
Down Roosevelt like Eleanor
We out the hood it's better for us
A private school in the suburbs
The quiet kid, he know his scores
Do he even have vocal cords?
They wanted me to speak up more
And I took this shit overboard
Worn like the mileage high, turned to a violent guy
I walk up in this bitch like ya'll know my name but it's funny cause I used to be kind of shy
Like, remember when [?] said hi, and I would just walk past her
I got a lot to say but not a lot of space so I talked faster
Now I'm far from the silent, feelin' less lost and misguided
College course is horse shit, no offense and I'm still undecided
On the fence like I was just here for the ride
I'm not up for election but could probably suffice as a write in
So quiet, because rejection like my biggest fear
My only phobia was growin' up and watchin' no one care
My character embarrassed, that it's hard to just be myself
My cellphone went from zero contacts to 'bout a million in a year

If it's flawed, it falls
If it's real, it won't
Just look at the stars, and know
Love is found, when it's lost

If it's flawed, it falls
If it's real, it won't
Just look at the stars, and know
Love is found, when it's lost

All I can be is myself
All I can do is me, R.I.P. to my stealth
Invisible but not invincible
Penetrable mental words like projectiles
How many of them went through
Went too far without talkin'
Talk about some shit you've been through instead of Bentleys and bent knees
That's a pet peeve I have when a rapper act like they can't breathe
They not alive but one dimensional, he went to the bank and withdrew his soul
But my soul is what I give you
Like Cassius duckin' the draft, now the fight is over hopefully I can win
At war with yourself when you look in that mirror you realize who you been fightin'
My father told me I'm 'bout to take it over, been recordin' since 10
Years old, not PM
These songs, these hymns
My life literally on wax from wacker to back out west though
Only nigga from the block that dream of different success
You think that he accept himself just cause he may accept a speech?
I'm out my comfort zone, I found myself, now accept me for me

If it's flawed, it falls
If it's real, it won't
Just look at the stars, and know
Love is found, when it's lost

If it's flawed, it falls
If it's real, it won't
Just look at the stars, and know
Love is found, when it's lost

When it's lost
When it's lost
When it's lost
Just look at the stars, and know
Love is found, when it's lost
When it's lost
When it's lost
When it's lost
When it's lost

Fake girls callin' me by my real name
Real people fuck with me cause I feel pain
Am I insane
For thinkin' that it's possible for me to blow up and I ain't deal 'cane?
I'm from the same street that fo' nem on, grew up on
That corner like they foundation is more like a cornerstone
Well wishes like a quarter thrown, even if it's sorta wrong
I'm 'bout to take it back like the waiter got your order wrong, crack epidemic
Fast forward thirty years, rap epidemic
Fashion and linen, fast bitten rhythm
I'm from the D, that's division, they put my nigga in prison
He wrote me every month and told me I'mma get it
I don't need your opinion, you don't gotta believe in me
There's niggas that'll bleed for me, the same go equally
Black ops lurkin' like COD
And white cops wanna kill me
Only cause I'm a black boy
The only rap boy that spit facts and I factoid
They kill niggas for their Concords
Me, I'm just tryin' to go on tour
My niggas comin' up with me out in carpool
To Toronto to something you all know
To something that you all know

[LeGit:]
You must got your finger pricked on a spindle
Friends call me L'z, but you can call me Vincenzo
Minus the Uzi and kitchen I'm on a mission 'til it's
Breakfast at Wimbledon, turkey sausage and French toast
With all my niggas, I swear I tell 'em we this close
You need a dollar I got ya, spot ya like Glenn Close
I'm twenty two with dreams of payin' off them Benz notes
They pulled me over, L'z suspended, damn, I didn't know
Didn't matter, cuffed to a banister, finger prints on a scanner
Most niggas that talk about shootin' dudes is actors
To keep it real you probably hard as chutes & ladders
My next shit a brick of piff, you smell it through the plastic
Sonnin' all you bastards, and you gon' meet the parents like a male nurse
Cause when it come to these sixteens I'm well versed
Few thousand fans in one room, we send that bitch to the moon
Remind me to let you know if the hammer fell first, they probably yell church
But I might show up to the function in a tinted Hummer
With a Zoe Saldana, just left Benihanas
Might cut her off right after summer, I don't really want her
Keep it a hundred, she just a prima doma that's on a scholarship
Say she do this as often as the apocalypse
I told her save that shit to a floppy disk
Girl save that shit to a floppy disk

Say where-where-where you are
Is a reflection of where we start
If you shine your light on the world
Promise that you'll go far...

// Tell You //

You don't know when to stop fighting
Hey, you already won
Shouldn't you be celebrating?
Naw, you're still going home

Diamonds are forever yet even a rock broke up
You waited to discover, lift up this rock I'm under
Pressure from the people to be on some popular
Magazines, the faster things leave quickly as they came
Leave as quickly as they came
I'm grown up, what a change
What a shame that it couldn't last
That venue booking sad, don't give a shit about me
They booked my best friend, now he at county
She dumped her boyfriend and then she found me
I said I wouldn't put that in a rap a lot
I say a lot, I figured it'd be aight

But I been meaning to tell you
That I been feeling low
And I just wanna smile
Cause what a better way to go
Woah, better way to go, woah

You don't know when to stop fighting
You already won
Baby you should be celebrating
Yet you're still going on

And we can be forever as long as the sky is lit
And even in the dark we ultraviolet
The finer things in life, we're trying to find them
That pot of gold, we dying to find it
I'm from the Go, we dying to die
Shit, it's like being a teen is more of a curse than the word shit
Might say some things I can't even find in my cranium
Boston grad, but only yield to the Grammys, ah
College scholarship from anonymous
Getting 15 credits then I dropped some shit
I dropped my songs more than dropping homework
Made some new friends, no longer a loner

But I been meaning to tell you
That I been feeling low
And I just wanna smile
Cause what a better way to go
Woah, better way to go, woah

I need a lawn and a balcony
Forbes watching my salary
And a chick with a bit of aphrodisiality
The grass is green, garden of eden speaking
Guardians guard me from the evils
I'll be, cause she know
That I'm cautious, I'll keep her
As closely as a kid
Croak if Imma sling her
Kingpin, I'm just a kin of
Lead her, never lead her on
She follow my feet though
Young wisdom seeker
Need me a goddess, Sofia
Woah, oh

But I been meaning to tell you
That I been feeling low
And I just wanna smile
Cause what a better way to go
Woah, better way to go, woah

// United Center //

The United Center
We're united in it
Go away for the winter, reunite -
I should start this out with a shoutout to Lil Papi (haha)

Boy, why you ain't got your tuition in order
You 'posed to keep them dollars coming, Travis Porter
Travis Porter, go to school, raise a family, pay your mortgage
And whatever responsibilities come along with your maturity
But you's a rebel child, oh you think that you're gon' be some rapper now?
You actually could have made it out
While you were learning to spell, your friends were getting expelled
Your mama sure taught you well
Grandma sure taught you well
Proud of where I'm brought up, brought up in the heart of
A slums, I didn't get a gun when you're born
Well you better have a nice pump, fake
Cause you drive to the hole with the score and the go
And the goal is to go pro
This for all those who had these dreams then got cut from the B team
They step back in the class rap
Not social psychopath rap
That I ain't left the lab since nine
The lab rap rat
Hood got change for your dollar and a dream
These niggas were cleaning crews
They weren't messin' with the team

In the United Center
We're united in it
Go away for the winter
Reunited when it
Got hot out, it got hot out
Some boy ain't make it out
This for y'all, this is y'all
Just continue to smile

Some boy ain't make it out

I want to be the next one to blow
I'm gonna be the next one to blow
My hood keep it negative, chasing your dreams down inception
The lessons you learn in school get put to use to sell them shit
Let's just stop going in it and [?]
Plus I'm more concerned with who horny, I'm gon get me some
Least females get me somewhere where thatreading don't
Plus my teachers keep telling me that, that I'm remedial
Hit the corner store and stain like I got a spill
Drop out like I got to spill, clean up on aisle one
These braille raps, you got to feel
My little nigga was like Steve Nash, dropping assists
They locked him up and said that he was an accomplice
Every man for theyself, run the V, that's the league
Ain't no talk of no team ball, just do what you see dog
It's horse, drinkin' wildwood on the porch
Brand name everything, imagining we endorsed

In the United Center
We're united in it
Go away for the winter
Reunited when it
Got hot out, it got hot out
Some boy ain't make it out
This for y'all, this is y'all
Just continue to smile

My backyard was the mad house on Madison
Reincarnated in the mason
Time don't wait, now they face-
I feel like I'm just supposed to be on some Late Registration shit and names, like everybody that's doing shit
Squeak on the boards, you feel me
Noname Gypsy in this bitch, Legit in this bitch
You feel me, real nigga shit
Uh, my nigga Damage here somewhere, you feel me
NAiMA on the beat, Ken Ross on the keys, Papi Beatz on the mix
All these niggas lame as hell for being in here sleep

In the United Center
We're united in it
Go away for the winter
Reunited when it
Got hot out, it got hot out
Some boy ain't make it out
This for y'all, this is y'all
