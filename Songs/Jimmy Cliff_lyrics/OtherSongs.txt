// A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall //

Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand takers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Oh, who did you meet my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded and hatred
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what'll you do now my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
I'll walk to the deepths of the deepest black forest
Where the people are a many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I'll tell and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my songs well before I start singin'
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

See them coming one by one

// Give The People What They Want //

Hey, hey, hey!
Give the people what they want

Well, its been said before, the world is a stage
A different performance with every age.
Open the history book to any old page
Bring on the lions and open the cage.

Give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
The more they get, the more they need
And every time they get harder and harder to please

The roman promoters really did things right.
They needed a show that would clearly excite.
The attendance was sparse so they put on a fight
Threw the christians to the lions, sold out every night

Give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
The more they get, the more they need
And every time they get harder and harder to please

Give em lots of sex, perversion and rape
Give em lots of violence, and plenty to hate
Give the people what they want
Give the people what they want

When olswald shot kennedy, he was insane
But still we watch the re-runs again and again
We all sit glued while the killer takes aim
Hey mom, there goes a piece of the presidents brain!

Give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
Blow out your brains, and do it right
Make sure its prime time and on a saturday night.
You gotta give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
Give the people what they want
Give the people what they want
Give the people what they want

// Goodbye Yesterday //

Goodbye yesterday, welcome today

Goodbye yesterday, welcome today

Dreams that saw me through a rainy day

So goodbye yesterday, welcome today

And my gamble hasn't been in vain

// Hold Tight //

Well it's an eye for an eye,
And a tooth for a tooth. [2x]

In this struggle for our survival
Your best friend can be your biggest rival.
If we must live by the laws of the jungle
Like dogs and pigs to rumble and tumble now.

And it's an eye for an eye,
And a tooth for a tooth. [2x]
It's an eye for an eye,
And a tooth for a tooth.

It's a war for world domination.
You've got to stand and declare your posession.
Cause we're the righteous won't be the agressors,
But we will fight against oppressors now.

Then it's an eye for an eye,
And a tooth for a tooth.
Because it's an eye for an eye,
And a tooth for a tooth.
Because a lie is a lie
And the truth is the truth.
So it's an eye for an eye,
And a tooth for a tooth.

Hold I, hold to your brush.
Hold I, be on your boundry.
Hold I, don't you let go now.
Hold I, yeah yeah.

Eye for an eye,
Tooth for a tooth.

And we know we won't be the losers,
We'll be the victors, or be the martyrs.
Cause we're fighting in the way of the most I,
That's how we know we shall not die now.

Hold I, hold to your brush.
Hold I, be on your boundry.
Hold I, don't you let go.
Hold I...

[Chorus]

We won't be the agressors
Fight downpressors now...
And dis ya jungle laws here
Me say...

Hold I my brush.
Don't you let go man.

// House Of Exile //

There's a day of feasting and a day of famine
Day of sadness and a day of joy
You could see in the day of feasting
Life isn't just a little play-like toy.

So the day arrived when you least expected
Cos you always thought you were well protected
Now you feel like a fish out of water
So now you're wondering what's the matter.

Oh remember you said it wouldn't happen to you
Now you're thinking how to start a new
A drowning man will catch at a straw
You were warned but you wouldn't take heed.

Everything in creation must obey a law.
Its true in words as it is in deed.
You were so puffed up in your pomps and pride
You're exposed you got none to hide

Yes, you used to look down on the folks beside you
Never they think you would have come down too

Remember they said you got to reap what you sow
Simple truth everybody know

Oh what are you on a house of exile
Watching you now on your own last mile
Yes, what are you on a house of exile
Watching you now on your own last mile

[Music interlude]

Oh what are you on a house of exile
Watching you now on your own last mile
O OH what are you on a house of exile
Watching you now on your own last mile

Everything in creation must obey a law.
Its true in words as it is in deed

// Human Touch //

I like the way I can communicate with you today
I like the way I can keep in touch when you're far away
I think it's cool to stay connected with you on Skype
Or on WhatsApp or some other app when the time is right

Still I love for human touch
I love for human touch
I need it oh so much, I just can't get enough
Of the human touch, oh
I love the human touch
I love the human touch
I need it oh so much, I just can't get enough
Of the human touch

There's nothing like your smiling face
And your warm embrace
And when I smell your sweet perfume
It's like a flower bloom

Oh, how I miss the way you give your tender kiss
And when you whisper in my ear things I love to hear

Oh, that's the human touch
Yeah, that's the human touch
I need it oh so much, I just can't get enough
Of the human touch, mmh
I love your human touch
I love your human touch
I just can't get enough, I need it oh so much
Your human touch

The more I'm connected to my cell phone
The more I'm disconnected from my own
And if I ever I'm in misery
Your human touch in my remedy

Makes me feel alright
Oh, I love to feel alright, oh

Oh, let me touch you, baby
Come on and touch me, baby
I need it oh so much, I need your tender touch
The human touch, ooh
Come on and touch me, baby
Oh, let me touch you, baby
I need it oh so much, I just can't get enough
Of your human touch

Oh, let me touch you, baby
Come on and touch me, baby
Oh, let me touch you, baby

// I Am The Living //

I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
I'm a giver, I'm a taker
I'm a liver and a miracle maker

At last, it has come to pass
I know if you just let it go
You will see that everything has its own place and its time
You are free to savor the rhythms and make your own minds

I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
I'm the meek, I'm the strong
I'm the right and the wrong

At last, it has come to pass
I know you'll flow when you just let it go
You will see that everything has its own place and its time
You are free to savor the rhythms and make your own minds

I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
I'm a stranger, I'm a friend
The beginning and the ending

I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
I'm the thirst and the hunger
I'm the oldest, getting younger

At last, it has come to pass
Living in the nature, it is greater yeah

I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
I'm the pain and the passion
I'm the essence, satisfaction

I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder
I'm the living and the loving
I'm a shelter in a hail of thunder

// I'm Free //

Whoa, I'm free, nobody now owns me

No, no, no, baby, you don't own me
If you think you do, you're sadly mistaken
I do what I wish and I go where I like, I'm free

I live the life I love
And I love the life that I live
I do the things I wish
And you ain't gonna stop me

Whoa, I'm free, nobody now owns me
Yes, I'm free, nobody owns me

I hurt you and I want you to forgive me
I know I hurt you and I want you to forgive me
'Cause I'm sorry and I want you to know

I walk straight in your life and then I walk it back
I can imagine how you feel
And I want you to know how I feel too

That I'm sorry, baby, I said, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, terribly sorry
I'm sorry and I want you to know
No, man!

I walk straight in your life and then I walk it back
I can imagine how you feel
And I want you to know how I feel too

That I'm sorry, baby, I said, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, terribly sorry
I'm sorry and I want you to know
Please forgive me, please
