// Look At The Mountains //

Mama look at the mountain
Papa look at the sea
Mama look at the mountain
Papa look at the sky
Iâm going up there
I'm going up there
Whoâs coming with me

You know Faith
Can move mountain
Honey, if you try
I say Faith
Can move mountain
Baby, itâs no lie
If i lose one eye
I still got one left to see
If i lose one leg
I still got one left to climb

Mama look at the mountain
Papa look at the sea
Mama look at the mountain
Papa look at the sky
Iâm going up there
I'm going up there
Whoâs coming with me

You know life
Itâs what you make it
And Iâm gonna make it good
Things donât always turn up the way they should
But Iâm not prepared to take it
No, no, no, no, no
They can move mountain
Honey, if you try
Faith can move mountain
Baby, itâs no lie

Mama look at the mountain
Papa look at the sea
Mama look at the mountain
Papa look at the sky
Iâm going up there
I'm going up there
Whoâs coming with me

Mama look
Mama look at the mountain
Mama look
Mama look at the mountain
Mama look
Mama look at the mountain
Papa look
Papa look at the mountain

You're the only one
To believe in
You're the only one

To believe in
You're the only one

Showered with their charms and their graces
When it comes down to being me
Just me
Just happy
Just free
