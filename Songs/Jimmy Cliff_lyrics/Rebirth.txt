// World Upside Down //

They say the world is spinning around
I say the world is upside down
They say the world is spinning around

I say the world is upside down
Oh yeah, all right

Looking at the world today
I am implored to say
So much war and poverty
While few enjoy prosperity

They say the world is spinning around
I say the world is upside down
They say the world is spinning around
I say the world is upside down
Oh yeah, all right

Looking at the world I agree
Oh what fools we mortals be
Morality is in demise
Immorality is on the rise

They say the world is spinning around
I say the world is upside down
They say the world is spinning around
I say the world is upside down

Oh yeah, too much injustice
How can there be peace?
Religious hypocrisy
Political tyranity
You see it my ,
What about the children now?

Hey
They say the world is spinning around
I say the world is upside down
They say the world is spinning around
I say the world is upside down
They say the world is spinning around
I say the world is upside down
They say the world is sá¹inning around
I say the world is upside down
Oh yeah,
Crime and violence
Poverty and starvation
Ecological calamity
Economic instability
What's wrong with humanity?
Have they lost their sanity?
For the love of vanity
What about the love, love now?
You know that we need it
What about the love, love, love yeah

// One More //

One more, one more, one more, one more
I got one more song I must sing
Ting-a-ling
Freedom ring
I got one more song I must sing
Simple song, so sing along
One more, one more, one more, one more
I got one more story to tell
Mystery, my story
I got one more story to tell
True story, my glory
One more, one more, one more, one more
I got one more arrow in my bow
And as I let it go
Just watch my flow
I got one more arrow in my bow
To the target and it's a hit
One more, one more, one more, one more
Hey baby don't you go away
I want you listen what I have to say
It's not over till it's over
I'm a natural lover
Hey mister get out my way
This is not, no time to play
Hey mister get out my way
I got to live for another day
All we got,
One more life to live,
One more love to give,
One more cliff to climb,
One more
It's my time
I got one more bullet in my gun
And I can't run
Till the deal is done
I got one more bullet in my gun
And I won't run
Till the deal is done
One more, one more, one more, one more
I got one more shot at the prize
So don't be surprised
Open your eyes
I got one more shot at the goal
Straight from my soul
And I'm in control
One more, one more, one more, one more
One more, one more, one more, one more
One, more, one, more, one more, one more
One More!

// Children's Bread //

They took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
Took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
They took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
Makin' so many peoples lives so hard

Now while those cats get fat
In came all the rats
Stole away the cheese
And doing as they please
Jack Spratt ate all the fat
His wife ate all the lean
And so between the both, you see
They licked the platter clean, so

They took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
They took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
They took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
Makin' so many peoples lives so hard
We're singing

Now there's a gathering on Main Street
Shuffling on Wall Street
To a new drum beat
Turning up the heat, now
Now the weak get strong
Singing a new song
Time has come for us to right the wrong

They took the children's bread, hey
And give it to the dogs
They took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
I say they took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
Makin' so many peoples lives so hard
We're singing

They took the children's bread, hey
And give it to the dogs
They took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
They took the children's bread
And give it to the dogs
Makin' so many peoples lives so hard, hey
Makin' so many peoples lives so hard, hey
Makin' so many peoples lives so hard

// Guns Of Brixton //

When they kick out your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun

When the law break in
How you gonna go?
Shot down on the pavement
Or waiting in death row

You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, Guns of Brixton

The money feels good
And your life you like it well
But surely your time will come
As in heaven, as in hell

You see, he feels like Ivan
Born under the Brixton sun
His game is called survivin'
At the end of the harder they come
You know it means no mercy
They caught him with a gun
No need for the Black Maria
Goodbye to the Brixton sun

You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh-the guns of Brixton

When they kick out your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun

You can crush us
You can bruise us
And even shoot us
But oh- the guns of Brixton

Shot down on the pavement
Waiting in death row
His game was survivin'
As in heaven as in hell

You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brixton
Oh, the guns of Brixton
Oh, the guns of Brixton
Oh, the guns of Brixton
Oh, the guns of Brixton

// Ruby Soho //

Echoes of reggae comin' through my bedroom wall
Havin' a party up next door but I'm sittin here all alone
Two lovers in the bedroom and the other starts to shout
All I got is this blank stare and that don't carry no clout at all

[Chorus:]
Destination unknown
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
[x2]

He's singin and she's there to lend a hand
He's seen his name on the marquee but she will never understand
Once again he's leavin' and she's there with a tear in her eye
Embraces with a warm gesture it's time, time to say goodbye

[Chorus]

Ruby's heart ain't beatin cause she knows the feelin' is gone
She's not the only one who knew there's somethin' wrong
Her lover's in the distance as she wipes a tear from her eye
Ruby's fading out, she disappears, it's time, time to say goodbye

[Chorus]

Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho

Destination unknown (Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho)
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
[x2]

// Ship Is Sailing //

Baby it's been a long time
We've been sitting on drydock
And it seems like all the pathways
Have been blocked

Now the tides have turned
And the rewards we have earned
Bringing us good feeling
Set our hearts a-reeling, baby

Our ship is sailing, there ain't no stopping
Our ship is sailing, yes we are moving
Our ship is sailing, and we are moving
Our ship is sailing, there ain't no stopping
'Til we say so

Hey now

Now let's rock it steady
Since a long time we've been ready
Let nothing detract our attention
Let's take our time
'Cause I'm feeling so fine
When you hold me tight
Everything's all right, darlin'

Our ship is sailing, yes we are moving
Our ship is sailing, there ain't no stopping
Our ship is sailing, let's keep on moving
Our ship is sailing, there ain't no stopping
'Til we say so

Hey hey now

Now with love and affection
We're moving in the right direction
Satisfaction is the key along the way
So let's share the joy
Like a child with a new toy
Baby hold me tight
Everything's all right, darlin'

Our ship is sailing, and we are moving
Our ship is sailing, there ain't now stopping now
Our ship is sailing, yes we are on the go
Our ship is sailing, there ain't no stopping

Let's share the joy (Our ship is sailing)
Like a child with a new toy (Our ship is sailing)
Baby let's take our time (Our ship is sailing)
'Cause I'm feeling so fine
Babe
Yeah yeah

// King Of Kings //

The Lion say," I am King and I reign."
The Lion say," I am King in this range."
"No more kings must be in this backyard,"
The Lion say," I am King and I reign."

Elephant say, "I am King cause I'm strong."
The Giraffe say, "I am King cause my neck is long."
"There's no doubt that you are all wrong,"
The Lion say, "I am King cause I'm double strong."

"I'm King of Kings and Lord of Lords in this land
No more back talk, Any of you,
Cause I'm King
From the beginning, I came as King,"
The Lion say," I am King and I reign."

"I'm King of Kings and Lord of Lords in this land>
No more back talk, Any of you,
Cause I'm King
From the beginning, I came as Prophet, Priest and King,"
The Lion say," I am King and I reign."
The Lion say," I am King and I reign."

"King of Kings and Lord of Lords, I reign in this land,"
The Lion say," I am King and I reign."
"That is I", the Lion say, "I am King"
