// Be Alone //

[Hook:]
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
Oh, oh, oh

I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause ya know, somewhere inside
I cannot find
The feeling I got from you

No, somewhere inside
I cannot find
The feeling I got from you

[Verse 1:]
Hard for a pitchfork, soft for a Rockefeller
Music was my side chick, but now we're moving in together
Always felt misunderstood, I guess I have to tolerate
My swag Jehovah Witness, dude, it never take a holiday
APC jeans, brown leather jacket on
KitsunÃ© cable knit, cardigan from Rag & Bone
Thick Filipino chick, homemade bracelet
Her booty make her just a rapper, she ain't gotta say shit
I'm someone they admire
Set the game ablaze, I'm an arcade fire
Laughed at my rides like my motion was funny
Yes, ashy to classy, my lotion is money
The ride is easy when the dollar's there to grease the wheels
Now everybody tell me what to do and how to feel
It seems the more I try to connect with the world
I am feeling more alone than I ever have felt before
I wanna pick up the phone, ask my dad how to handle it
But what will happen when my dad's not there to answer it?
I try to clear my mind of thoughts that only slow me down
Like when these niggas call me "faggot" and "we homies now"
But we are not homies, I just keep you around
'Cause all your talkin' is the noise I need to kill this sound
Have all these voices tellin' me no one can help me out
We are alone I'm just the only one to figure out

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
"You are the bestest, I will obey you"
These words I wrote for you when you were fuckin' other dudes
The only thing I need from you now is some solitude
Actions over words, "girls will be girls, " that's all it proves
I used to be this guy sittin' with an open heart
Now my computer screen's the only place I feel a spark
I don't fuck with fake bitches except for when I fuck with fake bitches
Canon 5D to take pictures of these girls who wouldn't talk to me a year ago
49er chick askin' for money, she get zero, though
Here I go again talkin' money, women, and clothes, and cars, right?
You could switch all of my words out with Plies', right?
People sayin' we're the same, please, come from under me
We are just some rappers, got no luxury of subtlety
No subjects when we're rappin', we say it like we hear it
I put it on a track but I hope you get the spirit 'cause

[Hook]

// Freaks And Geeks //

[Verse 1:]
Alright, Gambino is a mastermind, fuck a bitch to pass the time
Mass appeal, orange rind, smoke your green, I'm spendin' mine
The beat is witches brew, but beware this shit is potent
E.E. cummin' on her face, now that's poetry in motion
Yeah, Gambino make it work, I'm the boss move somethin'
Yeah, this cool fuckin' suits me, swag two button
Yeah, these girls be actin' crazy when they're dancin': Black Swan
I ain't fuckin' at the club, put your clothes back on
This beat is a disaster, 9/11 this track
Rappers wanna battle me, I have to mail their heads back
And my clique make that dinero, so it's time to meet the fuckers
I am runnin' this bitch, you are just a dog walker
Leavin' with your girl when we last seen each other
Yeah you fuckin' with the baddest like we tag team Rihanna
Fly girl on her knees, she don't wanna come near me
My dick is too big, there's a big bang theory
Got her picture in my iPhone, what do y'all think?
While y'all niggas masturbate, I'm in that Ariel Pink
If I am just a rapper man, you could've fooled me
I'm the shit, when these dudes talk, they talkin' bull me

[Verse 2:]
Okay (alright) I'm down with the black girls of every single culture
Filipino, Armenian girls on my sofa
Yeah I like a white girl, sometimes we get together
Need a thick chick though, so it's black and yellow, black and yellow
Love is a trip, but fuckin' is a sport
Are there Asian girls here? Minority report
Put your team on the map, Blake Griffin on the court
Niggas bitin' off my tracks, need a knife and a fork
We the illest, need a nurse, here's the check, grab your purse
Unless we fuckin', then I'll pay for all the food on the Earth, man
I got some pussy that was insane, so insane, it's an enemy of Batman
I'm dominant, niggas call me faggot cause they closeted
I'm hot as shit, comin' out the backside of a rocket ship
It's monster shit, you dudes are the opposite of Loch Nesses
Respond to this, we can squash the beef right now like sausages
Chillin' with my n-words, say it like a white kid
Yes your booty's big as hers, say that to my white bitch
So she don't get embarrassed, my dick is made of carrots
Bunnies wantin' to be fed, I meant honeys, oh forget it
I have worked all winter, I will not fail summer
In the back of the bush, like Gavin Rossdale's drummer
Yeah, my stinger's in her flower, I hope she lets me pollinate
Workin' hard as shit, yeah this beat is made from concentrate
Nigga can't you tell that my sample of Adele
Was so hot, I got these hood niggas blowin' up my cell?
Swag out the ass, I'm the man, fuck chico
Took the G out your waffle, all you got left is your ego
Think about it for a second, man we eatin', where's your breakfast?
Man, you hungry have this sandwich, got my wallet, cheese and lettuce
An elephant never forgets, so my dick remembers everything
Green inside your wallet is that pussy open sesame
Runnin' the game, fuck am I sayin', runnin' the Earth, give me a month
Told all you niggas I'm in it to win it cause havin' an Emmy just wasn't enough
You get sloppy drunk, I stay whiskey neat
My clique should be cancelled: Freaks and Geeks

// My Shine //

[Intro:]
Runnin' through the moment as the sun goes down
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound

I stunt hard
I make it work, yeah
I make it work, yeah
I make it work, who
I live large
I make it work, yeah
I make it work, yeah
Yeeaah

[Verse 1:]
Childish Gambino, lame niggas never heard of it
Sick Boi is the crew, fuck these niggas with a dirty dick
When these mothafuckas gonna understand I'm serious?
I'm hard in the paint, like I fuck her on her period
James Dean swag, leather jacket, white t-shirt
Rolled up sleeves, nigga lookin' like a greaser
Word is born, baby, my dictionary's in labor
Listen to the Culdesac and know that was an ultimatum
Man, why nobody wanna admit they like me just a little bit?
Won't be on the freshmen list, guess I'll just keep spittin' shit
Never be the rapper with $600 shades
No iced-out chain, Rod Lavers all day
I was hopin' they would see me just for me, dope rhymer
They do me like my first house, no co-signer
See you usin' qualifiers, you don't even know
"I guess he good for a rapper who on a TV show"
Even though, I was rappin' back when Lance had chemo, ho
Even flow, Pearl Jammin' niggas can't leave me alone
I keep a bone for these girls who liked me back when green was low
Feel me, though, DVR my thoughts and make your TiVo grow

[Hook:]
Runnin' through the moment as the sun goes down
Starlight, starlight
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound
All night, all night

But it's all for you to prove it
Keep on movin', keep on usin'
My shine, my shine, my shine

[Bridge:]
Ooh, take me higher, higher, higher
Ooh, take me higher, higher, higher

[Verse 2:]
Gambeezy make it work somethin', let me check the syntax
Don't add an eezy to my name, 'cause it has never been that
Aladdin on you fuckers, prince of the game from street rat
Dudes fall off, too steep like tea bags
Steady movin', don't worry about where I'm a be
'Cause I'm a be on these tracks like indie girls on Amelie
Honesty, I'm rappin' 'bout everything I go through
Everything I'm sayin', I'm super sayin' like Goku
Fuck nerdcore, fuck backpack
Fuck rap cool, I make cool rap
I make music for wack blacks to blast back
In fact, I swear the track I lie on's my last track

[Hook]

// Lights Turned On //

[Verse 1:]
Small chick with a fat ass
Did I say that out loud, let me backtrack
I know my game ain't that bad
Have you ever made out with a Gap ad?
And girls want what they can't have
So I don't text back when the screen flash
You love me? You mean cash
Need a friend you can fuck, I can be that
Crush girls now, couldn't last year
Oh, you like me now, well that's weird
Last year you were chillin' with Lil Wayne
Now you wanna pretend like my feelings is still the same?
My work is my playtime
I need you to understand and to stay fine
Do this and I just might wife you
Let me poke you ma, Raichu
Fuck ya life
I don't really think I drank enough tonight
Lookin' at you, make me wanna fuck for life
Lame-ass dudes gon' suck tonight
But so are these girls, am I wrong or right?
Girl, do somethin' to me
"Nah, baby, you way too hood for me"
Y'all girls have never been good for me
Watch a nigga take over, mutiny
I wanna fuck with the lights on
Hey, girl, let a python slide on
Stay sick, infect me, Lysol
I'm on the edge, they hopin' that I might fall
I make it work, I'm runnin' with a new crew
And we do dope shit you ain't used to
For me, by me, fuck Fubu
This girl never heard of me, go and check YouTube
I got a house with a dope view
See the ocean, dope shit, you an '06, I'm an '02
But enough about high school
I'm gettin' laid, or I'm gettin' lied to
You my stand-in Cameron, let me be your A-Rod
You number one in The Pack, Based God
Should I say somethin' dumb to give us somethin' to fight about?
Never mind, lights out

[Hook:]
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
Show me what you doin'
I don't wanna lose
Have them lights turned on
Show me what you doin'
Show me what you do to me, me

[Verse 2:]
Swag
2: 30 and we still makin' progress
Talkin' on Twitter to see where to go next
3: 30, man, where did the time go?
I'm chillin' with this Asian chick I met in Chicago
She look like the Social Network chick
Except for her ass is twice as thick, man
Just wanna bite that shit
Where the fuck did my license went?
I musta left it at the other place
I rent a loft downtown with a ton of space
Yeah, we doin' stupid shit, have stories when I'm older
But I don't wanna see pictures of us on Vulture
Never thought about a year ago
I'm chillin' out with the friends at the Super Bowl
Things change like a motherfuck
That's why I wild out, keep the city up
Uh, I talk a lot about the girls in my songs
But you are different from the girls in my songs
Stop talkin' 'bout the girls in my songs?
If you don't like it, I can just take you home
More green than the top of these tree trunks
Leave your boyfriend here, 'cause he punk
She like, "I'm not a slut, " speed bump
By the way, what's your name?, 'cause we drunk

[Hook:]
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it (we druuuunk)
Show me what you doin'
I don't wanna lose (we druuuuuuunk)
Have them lights turned on
Show me what you doin' (I'm drunk)
Show me what you do to me, me

I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
Show me what you doin'
I don't wanna lose
Have them lights turned on
Show me what you doin'
Show me what you do to me, me

I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it (I got to get high)
Show me what you doin'
I don't wanna lose (I need to get high)
Have them lights turned on
Show me what you doin' (I got to get high)
Show me what you do to me, me (I got to get high)

[Outro:]
I gots to get high
I need to get high
Uh, I needs to get high
Uh, I gots to get high

// Not Going Back //

It seems like they all want me to fail
But I'm not goin' back
Not goin' back, baby

Please tell me you don't want me to fail
'Cause I'm not goin' back
Not goin' back

I coulda been a tragedy
That's why these fake niggas who call me pussy are mad at me
'Cause they ain't have the smarts or the heart
Ain't you read the fuckin' book? Things fall apart
I was never gonna stay the same
All I ever really wanted was to change the game
Spent the year kickin' ass and takin' names
Try to tell it to your heart, Taylor Dayne
Mama told me I was special when them test scores came in
Callin' the new Will Smith, that's Jaden
Callin' me a faggot when I'm rappin', that's hatin'
I need to slow down, what the fuck is y'all sayin'?
Step inside the party, y'all niggas is mood killers
My lifestyle simple, live easy and Bruce Willis
I'm the boss, Michael Scott, y'all bitches is just Phyllis
Set the world on fire, y'all motherfuckers is chillin', what is this?
That's why these fuckin' MCs want their asses back
Don't you know that I'm a rapist? Ask a track
Whiskey-sippin', wanna drink the whole bottle
But these smart middle-class black kids need a role model
Fuckin' hate me, that's what I'm used to
Suck a dick, we the shit, Metamucil
God damn, man, there's gotta be a better way
Than pill-poppin' all these drugs so I can stay awake
Like I'm Jessie in this bitch, I'm so excited
There's a party at the top, you ain't invited
But it's lame, and all the bitches is fake
You think about your old girl and how breakin' up's a mistake
Black dudes assume I'm closeted or kinda gay
White people confused like girl on Glee and Gabourey
I Am Donald is a full-time job
These niggas want me to fail so they can write me off

It seems like they all want me to fail
But I'm not goin' back
Not goin' back, baby

Please tell me you don't want me to fail
'Cause I'm not goin' back
Not goin' ba-ack

Dirty girls love my dick, they're cockroaches
Jewish girls eat my meat, it's not kosher
Relax, black chick, I think that I have offended thee
Got nothin' against the sistas, I just don't think they're into me
I am not a thug, AKA what they pretend to be
I am just myself, AKA my worst enemy
Yeah, bitch, cut the swag with a fuckin' knife
I come hard like my life keep her pussy tight
It's cool, though, it's all good
You want a dude who keep it real, and stay hood
I'm sorry, babe, but I act me
I don't act black, whatever that be
I'm just happy these girls seem into me now
Yeah, they lookin' for some In N Out, animal style
With this lettuce, cheese, bread, makin' sandwiches
That's why you niggas fail like all of your parents' marriages
Ran into Rashida Jones, told me that she heard my song
When I called her mixed like the crowd at my last show
She said to write her somethin' nice on the next track
But she cute, so I wrote her ass a whole rap
Man, I threw that shit away, it felt dumb
Believe me, it was bad, we're better off, you're welcome
I worked hard on that song like day and night
That whole song, made this one verse crazy, right?
I guess it all goes somewhere, you know that
Like that bullshit you talked before Culdesac
'I didn't know he had it in 'I'm! '
Couldn't see me as Spiderman, but now I'm spittin' venom
Now you payin' attention, pick your fuckin' face up
When I wanna be a superhero I just wake up
Renaissance man with a Hollywood buzz
I refuse to go back to not likin' who I was
Because

Fake love, these fake dreams
These fake sounds
All the things that we felt
Your voice was screaming too loud
I know what you're ready to be
But it isn't with me
So I'm ready to leave you alone

I don't really wanna fight like this
I don't ever wanna lose your kiss
All I ever wanted was someone to hold on to

I just wanna be your girl
Everything you haven't heard, plus
I just wanna be with you

(With you) With you
(With you) With you
(With you) I just wanna be with you

(With you) With you
(With you) With you
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
