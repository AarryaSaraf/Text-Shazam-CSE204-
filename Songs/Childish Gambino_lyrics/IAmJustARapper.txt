Album: IAmJustARapper

// New Prince (Crown On The Ground) //

I do not talk, I am just a rapper

Stompin' on these niggas like a whack-a-mole with no hands
Get girls on the floor like slow jams
Fuck yeah, I'm feelin' myself, no lotion
My light shine bright, no roaches
Nigga, I'm focused
You the one who eyes wrong
Only time I'm worried is when I'm the no-fly zone
Cause I'm so fly, homes
Fresh like pinecones
Female phone book my iPhone
Margarita bright, meanin' limelight
Nerd girls losin' their shit like prom night
Mouth like a pussy? it can never be too tight
Let me guess, you know a better rapper? you, right?

Bam-B
Sicker than your grandma
Pass the mix-tape to a friend like Chandler
This track is gettin' over written
Sports night, Fanta
Tell 'em that you know me when you runnin' through Atlanta
I am at the top
Whether you want or not
And I am in my prime
I am an auto-bot
I do not talk a lot
I am just a rapper
Fuck a girl's pussy bright red like snapper

Sick

Yeah, I stay fly like a pelican
Get new kicks everyday like an ottoman
Ex-girlfriends askin' if they get a shot again
I try to call 'em back but there's a lot of them
Someone tell me why these muthafuckers busy hatin' me
Just because I'm rappin' and my style is kinda Japanese
Band of outsiders
Kitsune, APC
Macy's got shit on me

Fuck what you heard like a dick inside alarm clock
I ain't got no jewelry, I leave it at the pawn shop
Two of your chains equals one of my shirts, sir
You got Jacob's Jeweler, I got Anna Wintour
Niggas jealous cause I got more green than seven splinters
I'd rather spend that money on a polo from La Tigra
Young, smart, and handsome
Who could even ask for more?
I change the situation like auditioning for Jersey Shore

// Bitch, Look At Me Now (Two Weeks) //

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
I do not, I do not, I am just, I am just a rapper
Sick boy make moves like a chess piece
And that move real quick like Nestle
Let me make it clear for a second like Pepsi
I was never worried bout my wallet being empty
Cause when it was empty, I was still happy
Walkin' with my Walkman, freestyle rappin'
High school bullies like what the fuck happened
Nigga off the hook like I fuckin' shot the captain
And this supposed to be relaxin', rappin' is my hobby
I did this in my bedroom where I separate my laundry
Watchin' old episodes of Shining Time Station
You are now listening to my mouth on vacation (ation)
Why you doing this, what's your motivation?
I am just a rapper, I don't need the paper
No Will Smith went off without a hitch man
C-H-I-L-D it's the ISH man
Do sixteen bars no wristband
I'll always be childish, call me Maggie Simpson
Run the track like my tongue's an Olympian
I've always been this good, you just weren't listening

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
I'm a try to make my street cred stack up
I mean I'm rapping over Grizzy Bear, what the fuck
Gather swagger up, before I take it all
You started rapping when you wasn't good at basketball
I started rapping cause I fucking need some Adderall
I can't do one thing, I'm just too good
I can't do one thing, I am Tiger Woods
I make you iPod hotter than a lighter would
Picture me in sixth grade, overweight, overbite
Got my fake Adidas on, whiting out the fourth stripe
Kid named Vincent got it out for me, I hate that guy
Frodo from Chicago, really small and shy
You better recognize, cause I'm no better now
Cause I was always sick, my life's a hospital
And that's some funny shit, that turd is Apatow
That female dog is blind, well bitch look at me now!
I'm wearing tight jeans, and nobody's laughing
More pussy than recycled sanitary napkins
Bitch sitting shotgun in my Tracy Chapman
I did exactly what you niggas said would never happen
I'm doing me so big I can hardly walk
These rappers need ER like they're Charlie Park
Stay hard like my suit made by Tony Stark
This kinda music make your balls drop, Dick Clark
Yes I'm grown and sexy, and I'm worth the wait
Girls act like I'm the only dude on earth to date
Put these words on your head and let them percolate
We need to separate church and state
I used to have to pay for gas in my momma's Saturn
And now I'm paying for a mortgage as a working actor
If living my life is what you say you're chasing after
Nigga stop talking shit and just be a rapper (be a rapper)

// 49ers (Orange Shirt) //

[Verse 1: DC Pierson]
Whoa
What'd you get, amnesia?
I bet you wouldn't sleep on me if I was Lil' Weezy, huh?
Bet you wouldn't sleep on me if I was in a band or something
And my bank balance were around a grand or something
Ask you something:
Do you think I'm common like sense it?
That heaven didn't send this
Uniquely perfect dude so just discard me like a toy, then
But you know, I know, I'd make a damn good boyfriend
Oil can, oil can
You think I'm the tin man
You took my little heart and you kicked it like a tin can
Ain't you heard I got the kind of shine can make your skin tan?
In the lean time don't come crying for the thin man
In the mean time I'll be building my portfolio
All these other dudes eradicated like polio
With any luck you'll see me everywhere like Starbucks
I bet you wanna fuck me when it's time to star fuck

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
I didn't have green like an Arizona front lawn
Now they try to touch my face like an iPhone
Now I'm all gassed up like Exxon
Girls see the money like I fucking got checks on
I don't even know if this girl really likes me
Picking up the check like I'm working at Nike
Talking to this girl and I'm thinking that she's into me
Then I find out she's trying to break in the industry
That's really lame
I still hit it
But I refuse to be home girl's meal ticket
I'm looking for a sick girl to be a part of me
Not a girl who will try to McCartney me
Yes, homie I'm a man of my word
Got this shit in the can like a toilet of turd
And, yes, these gold diggers trying to get at my sperm
Well, I'm not a 49ers fan, in case you haven't heard
I know my girl out there somewhere
And if you hear this, you should come here
Unless you don't give head like a weird beer
Elroy, Bam-B, yeah, I'm outta here

// My Girls (My Girls) //

In the fourth grade I had a crush on Tia Smith
Sixth grade and this crush is turned to Beatrice
But they don't like me because I'm too nice
And I'm kinda fat and not the dope type

But I grew out of that and it's a miracle
Now every girl sees me as marryin' material
It's a buyer's market, I'm Alicia's target
And every other girl who wanna let me steam their carpet

I love these hipster girls and they feel the same
Now they don't have to choose when someone asks 'em Drake or Wayne
And niggas waiting on me, we didn't have a voice
You used to have to act street and now you've got a choice

My momma's brownie mix, I keep the goodies moist
Of every girl I'm tappin', this wasn't supposed to happen
Hard to keep my thoughts straight on every date
Especially when my penis talking SWAT team, cover me, I'm going in

I do not talk, I am just a rapper

Yes, I got a million other girls
You don't wanna hear that for fear that I fuck a lot
And you don't wanna get attached cause you'll like me
I fuck a girl named Keira nightly (Knightley)
Nah, I made her up
'Cause it sounded dope, I don't give a fuck
Ride me, giddy up
They can hear us in the hall, Arsenio
Naw, girl, I don't wanna shoot a video
I do it all day, don't you watch me on the TV show?
I'm gonna get mines any means necessary
Got Red Bull pulsing through my pulmonary
Least I feel like it, met her at a club
Now we're making out, and I ain't spend a dub
I'm gonna try to live it up like TOP FLR
And my girls like gifts so I bought more

All girls 18 and over love this light-skinned Casanova
House pimped out, William Sonoma
Sleep on me, that is a coma

Yeah, nigga, you see what I'm gettin' at
I'm gettin' at her, I'm hittin' that
Her kitty cat purr, how weird is that?
I'm diggin' that

A nigga not tryin' to say you don't make mistakes
I'm trying to fix all the hearts I break
But every time that we talk in my apartment
We're gonna kiss a little, and then we start shit

"You're heartless, don't call again
Don't email, we can't be friends
I swear that this is the end"
Then I call her next week and we do it again

My girls, my girls, my girls, my girls
My girls, my girls, my girls, my girls
My girls, my girls, my girls, my girls
My girls, my girls, my girls, my girls

(I don't mean to seem like I care about material things, like a social status
I just want four walls and adobe slats for my girls
Ow!)

(I don't mean to seem like I care about material things, like a social status
I just want four walls and adobe slats for my girls
Ow!)

// I Can Hear Your Feet (Sunrise) //

Sing. Uh.

Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.
Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.

I do not talk.

I do not talk. I am just a rapper.

Childish Gambino, hot as a flaming cheeto
I'm tighter than baby speedos
I'm shifting another kilo
And that's because my shits dope
Walking past the red rope
The bouncer is my kin folk
So I don't need credentials

Sick boy is my clique
I got that shit inside a headlock
Love to make that bam bam
We were born to make the bed rock

I am so hip hop
More so than you guys
I am legend
You guys are true lies

Tootsie like some jenga
Shout out to my topangas
Them fifty fit girls stay wrapped around my finga
Nerdy girls from every where
They scope me out like there he is
My whole crew's sick
I'm hanging out with jerry's kids

Hold up mother fucker
It's gambini on the microphone
Screaming like your father when he comes home and the light are on
Girls addicted to my dick
My wallet is there methadone
Brain dead niggas love beef
They are vegetables

I am on that fly shit
Fuck that, I'm orbiting
My face is everywhere
Fuck that, I'm norbiting

I can feel your heat, momma
I can hear your feet, momma

... give you the sunrise
I wanna give you the sunrise
I wanna give you the sunrise
I wanna give you the sunrise

// The Truth (Goth Star) //

[DC Pierson:]
Mr. DNA, flow so Jurassic
Clumsy archeologist about to drop a classic
Damn right we got a t-rex, I paid for that in plastic
Clumsy archeologist about to drop a classic
Mistake still burning but I'm learning like a raptor
Take what I'm given make it work like an adapter
Make short work of her, then I will adapt her
Critics all agree it was the work of a master
At last my success will match my fatigue
And at last I'll send my children to an ivy league
In the masks from The Strangers, freak the whole place out
Get your glasses on, girl, geek your whole face out
Don't open up your mouth unless to let something great out
And that's not a beef, that's just a peek at the steakhouse
A week at my maid's house to recharge my battery
Then I'll be right back on top like Slattery

You know from Sterling and Cooper
If she's paid out then I will recoup her
And if she's paid out then I will invest
And if she's really played out then I will impress
Wpon her the need to please please me, whoa yeah
Girl I'm on my knees
Ooh, I need it so bad
It's like I work at NORAD
It's DEFCON-5
Go out back to my car and drive

Cause shit just got real
Take a thirty wreck drive into a field
Pass out in my vehicle
Hope I wake up in a world more agreeable
Hope I wake aboard an unidentified flying object
Or a reject Enterprise
A Starfleet drop out odyssey
A route to cop out galaxies
Til then I'm in the light, right where the moths are
Impressive, depressive I'm a Goth Star.

[Childish Gambino:]
I do not talk, I am just a rapper
Nigga I'm on
Niggas try to off me
Like these girls like I like my coffee
In my lap
Fuck this track
It goes off beat but I'm on like clap
And dog, you can have my scraps
I'm close to these girls like her tampon flaps
I'm having an effect on the hood like crack
Even though I'm so suburban like a backpack strap

Don't you get it?
Read Ayn Rand
Then you'll understand why they call me the man
I'm just fucking special-er
Different from you other guys
Hating me in high school made me metamorphosize

Kafka-esque
The way I dress I need to send Bo Diddley some checks
On Marc Jacobs, Commes Des Garcon tie
Diddy is my swagger coach
Can't stop, won't stop
Heavy hitter, short stop
Horse face, horse cock
Bouncer, door stop
Tell me when enough's enough

Looking at me warming up
Microwave a nigga flow
Pity y'all don't see me though the rest of y'all already know
I get it like I gotta, man
Flier like a college band
Niggas looking for a deal and I cut out the middle man
Drinking fucking grape juice
Early at a wine bar
Blacker than Depeche Mode so I'm a Goth Star

// I Love Clothes (Deadbeat Summer) //

I do not talk, I am just a rapper

Nigga, I'm the capper
Rapper slash not actor
Cause I could never act the part of being fakey
You should really thank me
Who else would do this shit?
All that fucking wishing and waiting

These niggas are mistakin
You don't speak my language
Dressed like I'm cambridge
Bowtie make me muslim
Switch for suspenders
Two at least
Clickin through our hyperbeast
Tom Brown, Hells Bells, Kitsune, Jay L

I don't wear your shirt unless it got a logo
Now it's to go out and walk around soho
All high schools showing out, Pay less.
Man fuck that, yo I earned this.

I love clothes.

Go to top man
That's the hot spot
Check Kayne's blog for the high tops
Check shake appeal lookbook right quick
They hooking up with ambush, that's it
Sperry top cider with a black trim
Pink leather jacket, gotta get him
New t-shirt and I put it all
On a charge card
Burning through my go yard
And it's so dumb, but it's so tight
Ain't nothing like new shoes every night
And it feels so good in the new jeans
And the new shirt, it's addicting
I'm an addict

I don't want help, I'm a die in my brand new Louis belt.
But not Louis, it's too gaudy
Check the lime green frames this girl bought me
Billionaire boys club, I'm living it
One shirt, eight dubs
I'm spending it
Got shoes that I know I won't wear
And the problem is I don't really care
Got money, but nothing is forever
Every time I gotta buy I new sweater
By 211 I'll be dead broke
I'll be the homeless dude in a peacoat.

// Turd In The Oven (Diplomat's Son) //

I do not talk, I am just a rapper

C.G. but I'm real light talk
I know these motherfuckers wish I'd turn my mic off
Fuckin' Reddy Roosevelt
Big stick, walk soft
On top of this hill of pussy where I get my rocks off
Yeah my raps kill laundry
Knock socks off
Rappers think they're on the court
All they do is trash talk

But I do not talk, I am just a rapper
He's rapping over indie songs? This is a disaster!
But I made it dope like I'm cookin in the kitchen
And these niggas couldn't see me now I'm fucking with they vision
And these bitches wasn't listening
Now they fucking listening
Shoot from the hip, motherfucker I'm a hipster
Do big things like a whale is your sister
Bitches get all dolled up, Westminster

Fake niggas ain't happy, are ya dude?
More (w) raps than vegetarian barbecues
Can't learn, this rapping has to be part of you
Big dog, I'm steady reppin', I'm Marmaduke

And I'm trying to do
Everything
Sick Boy
Medicine
And I kill beef
Burger King
Elroy, and I jettison

I'm the atmosphere
I was always here
Girls tremble when they see me like it's cold in there
I do not talk don't chat neither
If it ain't about me then you shouldn't talk either
Gambi mixtape got em poppin out
The super late girls asking when the album droppin
If you ain't gettin yours then you better get something
My shit hot shit like turd in the oven

My mouth drops classics
Lips are historic
Tongue is amazing
Ask your clitoris

Underground king like a young Bun B
And these haters are pussy so they should love me
Cause I'm so T-I-T-E
Niggas can't believe that my shit is free
Indie rap niggas smoke purp, drink tea
Nigga, pop quiz: what you know about me?

And what you should know, I do a lot of this
I mean business, I'm the Economist
Big bad wolf, blowing over your cottages
Nigga on Twitter and ain't even a follow-ist
I'm dropping new shit, like the early bird
Shout out to Silverlake
Shout out to Williamsburg
To all my Slick Rick kids looking dapper
Do your thing and you are just a rapper
