Album: Royalty

// We Ain't Them //

Picking out my fro with my fist comb
I got a tab at the Stone baby, this long
My little brother was having a little trouble
I hope that he doesnât care that itâs in this song
Korean town lunchinâ, talking âbout how to run things
He said Atlanta wanted something
Waka, Jeezy, and Future got the streets locked down
Copycats making sure Tip keep that crown
You fucking âround with the truth, went to see The Roots
Quest brought me back on stage in a suit
I wear it hard cause niggas say that Iâm soft
Even Black Thought thought I made it a little hard, I gotta be honest
Feeling like the other stuff is kinda behind us
Making jokes here and there done got us some dollars
Iâm tryna show the whole world what it is and it ainât a game
He said homie stay the course, ainât shit changed
Weird night and everybody was tipsy
Hanging out with Questlove reminiscing âbout Whitney
He like, âMan, we canât even make it to 50?!â
That reminds me â I sent a long text message to my mom and pop
I got the same speech when I left 30 Rock
My mom like âWhy you wanna leave a good job?â
My dad said âDo your thing, boy donât stopâ
Shout out to my nigga Lud, shout out to my nigga Sway
For hanging out at the crib and telling me what you think
Speak from your heart and never compromise what you feel is real
And never let these white people tell you how to feel
Never let anybody tell you how to feel
I want what they had back in the fourth grade
Family vacates, you know I did it all
Just to see my little sis by a waterfall
My great granddad bought his own freedom
Walk barefoot to Virginia to start his own peanut farm
So donât be alarmed â man Iâm royalty
Jam of the week, V103
No cosign, no bovine
More swag, pull back on the punchlines
Starving, every track means lunch time
Iâm a star, how could I not shine?
Fuck boys chase hyper rap chicks
And niggas who stopped texting after 1.6
DG Lover ainât nothing to fuck witâ
D Money ainât nothing to fuck witâ
And whatâs a leader if he isnât reluctant
Too bad for yâall, Iâm blasting off
Iâm not Asher Roth, I donât sleep on my bread
Dick riders stay close, I might flash a ball
Sometimes, all this shit make a nigga feel guilty
I used to sleep with them roaches
Back of my mind though, I hope the show gets cancelled
Maybe then I can focus
Hawaii touch down, go ahead baby put your shades on
East Side! East Side to the gravestone!
Brown liquor but my girl in Bed-Stuy
Nigga, you got Drive like a sale at Best Buy
Hold up, hold up, we can do better
Put my voice on the track, man that shit is much wetter
At the studio at 8 AM
Hit the booth then eat, nigga we ainât them, nigga we ainât them!
Drop a line at your Facebook status
Said that shit about a week ago, you still mad at us
If thereâs something on your chest nigga let it out
Cause Iâm the best â da da da

// Royalty //

[Blake Griffin speaking]
This... is Blake Griffin. This... is Royalty

[Ad libs]
(It's Royalty! It's Royalty)

// One Up //

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Yea, we party 'til the sun up
You ain't liking what we doing â shut up
You ain't liking what we doing â shut up
We got that extra life, nigga one up

[Verse 1: Steve G. Lover]
Fuck the recession, I'ma keep this thing going
If you ain't know 'em, bet you probably still work for 'em
Chick from Bermuda, that's right I get my work foreign
They don't get paid, I got hard dick and purp for 'em
Niggas out of line, get a shovel in the dirt for 'em
Niggas wanna move, get the trucks and the shirt for 'em
OG status, my job's got perks for 'em
Money, clothes, hoes, you ain't ever gotta search for 'em
You know what I'm doing, nigga I'ma do things
Getting to the money, I guess I got a few things
Fifteen nines, five dimes, only two chains
Smoke like Jamaicans, run it like I'm Usain
Fresh from the haircut down to the shoestrings
Hoes talk about me, I'ma need a new name
Steve G the prince, I'm looking like the new king
All I do is win so who the hell's losing

[Hook (x2)]

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Bino what the dealy, I heard that flow was silly
I heard you was so east side and that pussy's your Achilles
But really it's time to get up, smoking on that get up
Bino lay it down and work it out like a sit up
I'm feeling like a winner, my living be so easy
My old girl look Leona, my new girl look Ukemi
So illy, I got espressos, mi mami give me besos
Shades on my face, Armani helping me lay low
D-Money get his name, these other niggas lame
These niggas used to hate me, I guess ain't nothing changed
Shotgun in the Porsche, she don't know where we going
American Royalty on that yolo Ralph Lauren
It's that city where Luda be, stunting was new to me
But now we killing paper, fuck it I might just shoot a G
Leave your face open like you Breezy, I mean it
Nobody need to see nobody leaking, believe me

[Hook (x2)]

// Black Faces //

[Intro: Nipsey Hussle]
Turn that beat up for me
Really everything, like the headphones
Yeah, yeah, a little bit louder
No punch, you know that mean that we workinâ hard

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, young rich nigga shit, pops was an immigrant
Lifestyle illegit, but know I own businesses
Started out the trunk, ended up at the dealership
All gold Rollie, black face no blemishes
Legend in my city cause I grind so vigorous
If I show my face west of Texas, thatâs a big event
Gotta pay me twenty cents just to hear me vent
Iâm really out here on some shit, you should take a flick
Ballinâ on my own ten toes, so the difference is
I call shots never ask for permission, man
I got a lot of big plans in my vision and
I ainât failed yet, âbout a dollar hell yes
Iâm a problem, failed test, itâs only getting worse
I swear Iâm getting money, I just hope you gettinâ yours
Iâm killinâ niggas solo so you know Iâm gettinâ more
Now that young Gambino on the chorus, go

[Childish Gambino - Chorus]
This is for that real shit, this is for that East side
This is for my bad girls, this is for them good guys
This is for my grandma, this is for that West side
This is for them niggas talkinâ shit on a website
Damn I feel good, you ainât feelinâ nothinâ
This is for my niggas who be livinâ dime a dozen
Bino got that good shit, Nipsey got them aces
On some young rich shit, Kennedys with black faces

[Childish Gambino - break]
Yeah, black faces
My rolly so racist, all black faces
Obama on that million dollar bill, black faces
Yeah, nigga, black faces
Look, yo I got this
Yo, turn, turn it up a little
Ay, here we go, okay

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
League of my own, swag Geena Davis
Only rapper make 100k on your playlist
Niggas talk on twitter, but in life they donât say shit
My Rollie so racist, all black faces
We the new, face it, kill âem like Jason
Grind in my sleep man a nigga need braces
Wonder what you feelinâ like, used to be the nervous type
They ainât mention Bino? Man that shit must be a purpose, right?
Hostile, nigga my style
Kind of flow to paint a picture, Norman Rockwell
I donât eat pasta, everything is low-carb
I donât fly coach now, say I fly Goyard
Leave a face covered in that coast guard
Metaphor Mozart, all we do is tell âem the truth
M Fox to my people on some family ties
Magazines got black faces when somebody dies
I mean look at Donna Summers, she was tryinâ to survive
People wrestle over petty cash
When we should be really cryinâ over that one percent
Like we tipped a milk glass
Fuck yâall, Iâmma let my grandkids ball
Look to the future, these dudes so last week
See me stuntinâ so Conde Nasty
Me and Nipsey on some grown shit, no rent
Own shit, so Jim Crow shit, black faces

[Childish Gambino - Outro]
Ay, nigga, black faces
Black faces
Thatâs royalty, nigga

// Unnecessary //

[Childish Gambino:]
Who the fuck, Gambino, this nigga on your TiVo?
My hotel cost a kilo, banking like a free throw
Fuck y'all, we A-Team, y'all plan B like Walgreens
Cop that shit and paint it black, niggas want they summer back?
Ha-ha, no way, hublots, Dolce
Beans in my hand, girl in the car
She still with her man, but she seeing me tomorrow
Homegirl on that Master P, watch us ball like referees
Unnecessary roughness? We just trying to function
Used to sport them Filas cause my cousin pack them heaters
We don't wife 'em like Khalifa, we just party then we leave 'em
Tell 'em that we hittin', we don't really see 'em
My girl look best when she only wear a fitted
Q and 'Bino in the house and you niggas in the senate
Get it?

Four thou' on my fit, that's unnecessary
Skiing in Japan, that's unnecessary
Molly on my rider, that's unnecessary
'Bino spit the fire, that ain't even necessary
That's unnecessary, that's unnecessary
That's unnecessary, that's unnecessary
Roll out on a plane, that's unnecessary
'Tussin and champagne, nigga that ain't even necessary

[ScHoolboy Q:]
They said don't buy the belt and I got it
They said don't get the Rollie and I bought it
Nigga, I'm balling
My fucking mixtape can get you through college
Getting them dollars
Showing my pearly white teeth, I'm a nigga that's flawless
Came a long way from dumping out Impalas
Same gun and pants, different ski mask from coppers
All of this copper
Knock knock, who could it be? Niggas know I got it on lock
Yawk, yawk - bitch rappers better move 'fore them niggas get dropped
Mr. Flop boy, you got your label hot
I'm the hardest out, you's a table cloth
Unnecessary balling, I was carted off
Been fucking with my side bitch so much my main bitch can't stand it
Hunned racks in three months, man this shit is outstanding
Seen a dollar go to stupid racks, billion, trillion
Nigga, that's what I call building
'Bino what it do, let's go half on a million

Bathroom DVR, that's unnecessary
Pushing in that bulletproof, that's unnecessary
Stunting in the mall, that's unnecessary
Condo on my arm, that ain't even necessary
That's unnecessary, that's unnecessary
That's unnecessary, that's unnecessary
Ibiza for a day, that's unnecessary
Shows a hundred K, that ain't even necessary

[Ab-Soul:]
Black Lip Bastard
Actual natural disaster
I did a song about DMT
Soulja Boy did one right after
3 eyes, these guys ain't seeing me
No radio showed up over B.o.B
G-O-D Emcee
I'm the devil with angel wings
Pilot Talk, currency
Stole the show, burglary
I love that flow but I got more
Open condoms in condos
Open bottles of Moet
White with white girls in Eugene
We used to call hoes on 3-way
And take 'em out to the movies
And now we just do it our way
She driving stick in the driveway
Just popped a molly with Miley
She do shrooms every blue moon
Hundred million trillion muthafuckin' racks nigga
Pinot grigio the lean'll go in that nigga
Now that's unnecessary
Been a legend since elementary
Ayo, Bino, tell these niggas I ain't no joke
She don't need speak, she ain't giving no throat
You are under my control
Suspend the L's but I'm on a roll
Grade A, honor roll
Mayday, Soul!

// Shoulda Known //

[Hook (x2)]
One love
You can let it out
You can let it out
You can let it out, cause
Shoulda known, shoulda known
Shoulda known, shoulda known

[Verse 1]
Bino, I'm so for real-o, green like I'm Cee Lo
Hangin' out with Kilo... Kish, smokin' on that keisha
I'ma need that visa
I'm working on everything that I'm touching man
I'm bussin' two white Russians drinking themselves
But it still ain't nothing yo
It's East side if you can't tell, North Decatur and Glendale
So fuck y'all, all y'all, if y'all don't like me... good
Put that on my partner man, I wish a nigga would
I say we ain't playing man I hope that's understood
I'm in my zone though, fucking round with that 4-0
Eating my mamas salmon but skipping on the risotto
Girl said that she need the follow, tweet her and she'll do any
Man, I'm trying to stay off, readin' em makes me angry
On the back on the tour bus, recording the two of us
Stacks at the Apple store, man this ballin' is new to us
Trying to make amends, bailing on all my friends
Nigga went to the clubs and a beat to Gucci instead
Man I'm feelin' right, my nigga Fam yelling "don't stop"
And half my crew is always faded on some lowtop
Stopped drinking for the most part
My only vices all our pictures on my laptop
Screaming at me saying "I ain't what you really want"
Christina's parents baby all I make is Milians
We got the shows, we got the paper, but I want respect
So tell them haters we ain't quitting yet
Let 'em know

[Hook (x2)]

[Verse 2]
One love, the thing that hasn't changed
My parents lost their job, it's so cold in the A
Now that I'm 1%, I send most of it home
I want to stunt but she need to pay off her student loans
And everybody saying, "Get it while you hitting man
We want them harder beats, that 808 you slipping man"
Dude is so stupid popping anything they hand me
On that parking lot pimping and politicking in Miami
In that home of the D where they sell that cake batter
Heard a voice in the back, came from all the fake rappers
That I shitted on, shitted on
Shitted on, shitted on
Rap your soul, dude, let the mic blaze
Show 'em A-Town, East Side, all day
I put it on, I put it on
I put it on, I put it on
Life is somethin' IMAX, film is at a climax
I ain't even started, Was it stupid I departed?
Man, probably, but now we do the things we always wanted
I'm proud of me, cause I am undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with
Please somebody cum laude me
Graduated, anticipated the hatred and doubted me
Not a prodigy, just a hard worker from the Dean's List
But most these rappers doin' so-so like a seamstress
Jesus

[Hook]

// R.I.P //

[Verse 1: Bun-B]
Late ass nights come from long days
Doin' all the right things in the wrong ways
Doin' all the wrong shit for the right reasons
Sprinklin' midnight game, call it night seasoning
Haters get salty give 'em cholesterol
Trill O.G, mop up the floor with the best of y'all
Then dry that bitch off with the rest of y'all
And catch a flight to Rio de Janeiro for la festival
Yeah, and that's word to fit a baldy
Ball hard like I see menace out of my Spalding
And I'll break your face with a no look pass
Now back to your parking lot pimp with yo little hook ass
I use harsh words cause these are hard times
And trill-ass people, nowadays they're such a hard find
So it's when I open if I could keep 'em
And one on the scope, so if they frontin' I can sleep 'em
Man, my flow is so parabolic
The energy'll blow you over even if you're Broly
Goddamn it, now that's one for the Googlers
That fell asleep on they desk and never step their noogle up
Takin' lames out never been new to us
The hardest part of this shit is figurin' which of you to bust
Then step your weight up like GNC
And R.I.P. to Chris Luda reppin' CNC
Straight G

[Hook x2]
There's somethin' inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you boy
But you're still the same

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Rest in peace to them niggas who was dead wrong
Toni Braxton to them niggas, that's a sad song
Cry a river Timberlake, the whole industry
Record the whole album in my living room in Italy
Niggas who wasn't feelin' me secretly want a handout
Keep your mouth shut, I can probably help your man out
Drop a new stack all lames get to steppin'
Drop a new track all blogs go to heaven
Kill the web, man these niggas need they hits up
Kiss her neck, add a dime to the tip cup
She is not "slut," fuck a dude who says so
Just because she fuckin' doesn't mean she ain't a lady
Kill the whole stage, I never needed a mic check
Semen on my spacebar, fuckin' tired of Skype sex
Runnin' with a new breed, me and Bun B
This hip-hop nation, that big country
Nigga please! We ain't stop for no one
Wu-Tang Generator name, I'm a shÅgun
Wu-Tang Generator name, watch him smoke one
Talk a lot of sh*t, but none of them will approach him
Gambino got first position, the game is ballet
So graceful; drive, he don't need a valet
So angel: fly as I wanna be
Mercy, somebody show these niggas can't hurt me
Woah

[Hook x2]
There's somethin' inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you boy
But you're still the same

// American Royalty //

[Intro: RZA]
Digital. Childish Gambino
Mixtape demonstrations

[Verse 1: RZA]
This Oxycontin carbon monox' and toxic concoction
Collapse your brain cells, they swell from lack of oxygen
Leave the opposition stuck, without a pot to piss in
Hocking, spitting up blood, shark by sharp precision
Dart incision, darkness imparts your vision
Sparks infliction, (poof) I'm a mad magician
Double plasma, verbal scatter, globe will shatter
Every atom in your body, now you antimatter
Ripping through the data, checked into the doctor
Took his rhyme splatter, cause my mind's faster
You falling down to ground, while I climb the ladder
Too much garbage in your gallbladder, fall flatter
On your face, now you carry by the pall-bearer
Or wear the black suit, eyes all teared up
Oh no, when your ho make a boss lit up
We in the rib with a smirk nigga, all geared up
Childish Gambino or Bobby Digi'lino on the tracks
We breaking more backs that Sammartino, Bruno
We saw more baselines than Juno
Change more law in New York than Mr. Cuomo
Godfather novels I write like Mario Puzo
Master time fix the clocks like I'm Hugo
Hold the weight like nine sumos
Bust shots like John Lugo
You know how the Wu go

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Look sharp, homie give yourself a face lift
High brow, eyebrows on a spaceship
Take sips of that Ace of Spades-es
Saving all my money just to waste on a bracelet
Can't see them haters, we don't give a fuck though
Charge it to the game, keep a lame so cutthroat
Never slip a fast one, the game is so in front of me
Travel 'round the globe, spend a nigga 'bout a 100 G's
Pack them crowds up, boss like Bowser
Deep pocket poetry, my custom trousers
Thank God they found us, the game was starvin'
I'm clean and concrete, you ass and Charmin
Bobby Digital, Do you really think these niggas know shit?
Shopping in Manhattan and I ran into my old chick
Pride is a bitch. I am not a grown up
Tweetin' when I'm 70, these half-dead followers
She look like she Spelman, secretly she Hofstra
Put her in the club, all she wanna hear is Waka
Put her in the crib, all she wanna hear is Waka
She jerk when I move like her old boy popped her
Home is that Outkast, soul like Phonte
Old-school J's like Beyonce's fiance
Back on on my dumb shit, nigga we the stupidest
Gave them niggas real shit, don't know what to do it
I did what I did man, did you see it though?
'Bino hard and fast, niggas sweet and low
American Royalty, family loyalty
We cream of the crop why the fuck would we stop?
She had two sons: Both of 'em good grades
Both of 'em rap songs
Where did she go wrong?
Nowhere mama, we just go where the money at
Black Kennedy, where the fuck you niggas at?

// It May Be Glamour Life //

[Intro]
It's royalty
It's royalty

[Verse: Ghostface Killah]
Hey world, this is lollipop
Raps for the sweet tooth
The real fiends who want that GhostFace and Sheek Louch
Big chain changlin' charms, they be danglin'
Eighty thou worth of the ice, I'll strangle 'em
My raw fish scale, paid the jeweler named Ishmael
Had to eagle fly back to my wrist
Bigger chips, bigger wings, bigger rings
I'm with the Childish Gambino
On that Eastwood shit, pushin' a Gran Turino
Tarantino don't got reservoir dogs like mine
Thirty six different niggas with the same state of mind
Dirty ghetto kids lovin' them haters
We got skaters that'll ox your whole face off
Rob you like Madoff
Drug kingpins on the diet, we get that weight off
Real hood niggas snatch a bitch and clean your plate off
Gambino rap, cash money crack, table casino
Pushers into emerald sapphire visuals

// Toxic //

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Flow so pneumonia, yo bitch want my boner
I take her round the corner then I gave the ho a bonus
Bitches wanna bone us, we ain't cubic zirconia
But I will never own 'em so to me them bitches loners
On the deck, and a tongue flip like the "my" in "My Sharona"
Got her drip, drip, drippin' like that lemon and Corona
Bank roll thick like that neck on Sabonis
But I will never trick, you just get dick and balonis
Take that tenderoni, and now she ride my pony
And cheese came with it like a snatch of pepperoni
I'm an O.G. I'm with CG
You a he-she, nigga run you back like a repeat
I'm a pill poppin' ET, Givenchy on a ten-speed
Hot like Britney, in '03 ya know me
Smokin' on that Toxic, sippin' on an O.E
Dippin' in that Molly got me higher than some Flow C

[Hook]
Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Fandango my mandingo, we should do a movie
Groupies lookin' like the Yakuza in my Jacuzzi
Excuse me I'm on that ooey, my pockets are life with Louis
Euros is different colors, my wallet look like a Coogi
He who speakin' the least is Chief Keefin' the peace
Leavin' seeds in yo niece, prayin' that she ain't late
Sprayin' like that AK, now that shit my namesake
'Bino you so nasty, ass like an ashtray
Smokin' Flying Lotus, used to be Jehovah's
I'm in yo girl and now she feeling Polish like perogies
They hopin' that they smoke us
N'aw man, never that
Trippin' off that earwax, Danny Brown and D-Stacks
Ill pandemic, man that shit be everywhere
Midas is your highness and you horrible like Gummi bears
Why I'm fly like a cockpit, you don't fly like a ostrich
Stupid shit like a mosh pit, can't believe this is "Toxic"

[Hook (x2)]
It's in the air and it's all around
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Too high, can't come down

// Silk Pillow //

[Verse 1: Beck]
Centrifugal force pulling me off-course, in a horse race
Changing horses midstream, fourteenth place
On videotape surveillance playback
Sigh you lose face, disgraced, God forbid you
Fall off of the face of the Earth with chase
The black hole of what you thought it was worth today
âDonât shoot the piano playerâ I heard them say
It was your fault, centrifugal force, you got caught
Convict monotonous, a verdict thoughtless
As you read it out loud, at least I was being relatively honest
Standing in your office trying to speak to some anacondas
Leaking sawless from the sawdust
While your doppleganger stands copless
No one notices, they got their own dramas
Drama-ramaâs mellow dramas
You draw commas on the eyes of madonnas
And wonder why you canât turn traumas into nirvanas

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Donât mess your head up, still run with these young bucks
Still runninâ on jet fuel, still pimpinâ on what-what
What was I thinkinâ? I wasnât
What am I drinkinâ? Iâm buzzinâ
Speakinâ of weekends I used to fuck with your cousin
I used to rap about nothinâ, now I rap about nothinâ
But that nothinâ was somethinâ that ainât nobody was bumpinâ
See I still got it boo-boo, just a battle, do you
Wonders if you donât wanna be under some gross dude
But most girls will do it just for a corner seat at Nobu
I bet your daughterâs perfect, he say it like he know you
My daughter isnât living yet, at water village idiot
Their flowâs dumb, but that royaltyâs the silliest
Now

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Someone tell these niggas I ainât fuckinâ âround
Fly them all to Vegas man we hold it down
Livinâ for the present, nigga we fuck futures
Sippinâ on some whiskey, these bitches drinkinâ Kombucha
Recession means more oppression, these niggas will shoot ya
Rio de Janeiro, these bitches lookinâ like Xuxa
Talk with anacondas, at least Iâm beinâ honest
Iâm tryinâ to turn these Keke Palmers into baby mamas
Baby mama, Iâm your baby, mama
Man, let your boy drown, they ainât save me, momma
They ainât save me momma
They ainât save me momma
Silk pillow for that new weave
Silk pillow for that new weave

// They Don't Like Me //

[Childish Gambino]
Somebody tell they people what the fuck is up
I'm grindin' like a doozer looking cool as fuck
I'm grindin' I'm most hated but I sell the stage
I'm grindin' I'm most hated but I'm gettin' paid

[Chance The Rapper]
Eddy Scissorhands is workin' on my linin'
Gettin' spiffy for these bitches I be eyeing
Fr-Fred Mercury was playin' while I'm ridin'
Down the Ryan, in a Scion
And I'm flyin', but it's cool, I got insurance
On the run cause I got warrants, but it's cool I got endurance
It's cool I got suspended, but in turn I got some earnings
Could've spent it all on Thursday, but I saved it for my parents
But I spent a bit on Friday, in the night I hang with Donald
I'm tired of McDonalds, when a chick that cook chicano
That can't speak a lick of English, and pronounce my name like Chano
She say something something Spanish
I look back like, "Bitch, I know"
Tonight, I'ma make decisions for life
It's a Lucy Boomer dark lookin' light, some might drive
That's that shit right there that I don't like
There that shit just had to say
Shouts to the niggas that passed away
And shots for the niggas that's here right now
And shots to the niggas that got away
So sad to say, but it's all good
Niggas gon' celebrate, and wait for the day
Shit, that and A with alize
Like live from the Chi', it's Saturday night

[Childish Gambino]
Used to have some patience, now it's all gone
Force feed these motherfuckers eatin' foie gras
Force feed these motherfuckers not a rockstar
I'm a say my piece, these other rappers lockjaw
I don't think they like me (I don't think they like me)
I don't think I'm icy, I think I'm aight, B
Niggas wanna fight me? That's unnecessary
I don't quit for shit, that's my legendary

[Sample: Dem Franchize Boyz "Ohh I Think They Like Me"]

// Arrangement //

[Verse 1: Gonage]
I got yo bitch layin' naked 'cross the bed, no rosary
Stackin' up this bread like a baker, Josephine
She wanna refill, so I get that ho a bean
Niggas on the sideline yellin' "Who the fuck is he?"
Bitch I'm @Gonage, you can call me Cody B
Wardrobe overseas, passports all over me
White leather seats lookin' like coca leaf
Every time I crank up the woofer sittin' on a key
I'm Gucci buckled up, house note on my feet
Linen button-up like I'm walkin' round on the beach
Blind hoes notice me in my Range Rover Jeep
So they wanna come and talk to me like Jodeci
Smokin' in the morning, and when I go to sleep
Blowin' presidential man I think they 'about to vote for me
Any event we party like a frat, no toga sheet
If money ain't the convo, you ain't even supposed to speak

[Hook]
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit
In the VIP we champagne-spray shit
I'm in the club lookin' like a bank statement
If you talkin' cash, I can make arrangement
Walked in the club, ain't pay shit
Broke niggas hate, caus' they ain't shit
I'm gettin' to the cash pockets on payment
If you talkin' cash, I can make arrangement
Cody

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Cody Bean Sr., pushin' mean ether
You don't know Childish, nigga me neither
Eastside Atlanta, flyest nigga in a Waffle House
If it ain't money, man, we ain't got shit to talk about
Kennedy compound, my 20-room house
So big my ex-girls ain't gotta move out
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit
My bank account look like when little kids break shit
Ooooooo, if I'm breathin' I can handle it
Watching all my dreams get together like an ampersand
Blueprint the new shit, mixtape management
Show these dummies how to do it, all I want's my ten percent
Porsche brand new, passed 'em a cool hundred
Yeah my girl 5'2", even her growth stunted
It's the nigga y'all knew back when I flipped meal cards
Now my meals free when I don't taste the fifth star
We can make arrangements, old money Cambridge
Meetin' with the moguls, make 'em richer and they owe you
It's the kid you used to talk about, I'm watchin' people get up on it
On Worldstar and I ain't have to have a nigga moment
Flow's always cold, keep the whole soul anemic
Never left that hard shit, a nigga's always constipated
Got the change for my cousin on froze, no more movin' weight
Flossin' hard, ice king, no more Finn and Jake
Love or hate you gotta say the hype is something handsome
As long as all of 'em bloggin' I'm living Richard Branson
Shit talkers still talk, haters on my billboard
Used to take the Q home, now I hang with schoolboys
So iconic, Black Kennedy this shit
Man I'm so ironic, man this ratchet need a fix
Droppin' new shit and the haters get the splashback
Don't be surprised when he ask you where the cash at

// Won't Stop //

[Hook: Danielle Haim]
We are so far away from here

[Childish Gambino]
Tell them "Run it back", this song is my shit
Told that DJ, "Turn it up", all we did was bowflex
It's that Stone Mountain, DeKalb county
Fuck boy no shit about it
Still real, no shit, cash gun, money clip
285 to 400 then I made a left
Man we spend it up in Lenox, boy we fresh to death
They be sleeping when I left, now they heard of me
We get paid to keep y'all hyped, that's that turnip green
New kicks, street ball, black top, asphalt
Tight dress, her ass fall, get face like bath salts
Airport atheist, though may pray when there's turbulence
So why the fuck am I stressin' over this nervous shit?

[Hook: Danielle Haim]
We are so far away from here
We are so far away from here

[Childish Gambino]
Burn burn burn
My new car, my new clothes
Now that I'm on top, are you proud of me?
Burn burn burn
My new car, my new clothes
Now that I'm on top, are you proud of me?

All I really wanted was a left turn
Never thought it'd go and leave a nigga burned
Now that I'm on top, are you proud of me, proud of me?
All I really wanted was a left turn
Never thought it'd go and leave a nigga burned
Now that I'm on top, are you proud of me, proud of me?

Are you proud of me?
Are you proud of me?

I should have known

// Bronchitis //

Fiji water and a box of old Raisinets
I got a real taste for dyin' but I ain't do it yet
I tried to watch The Artist with my girlfriend
But instead I lost the battle with some NyQuil
Playing Double Dribble with my older cousin
Now I'm ballin' everyday so dude that's gotta stand for something
But it doesn't change the subject
Man, I'm hustlin', sandals cuttin' up
My ankles, please and thank you
Demons hate you when you angel
Never been to prison, but I serve a sentence
Grind when you -
I'm sharin' experiments with Seventh Day Adventists
And on the seventh day, I'ma show y'all what the event is
Dollar signs, bottom line
Speak the truth and everybody gon' hate you
Unless it's funny
That's how I used to make money
I don't roll with the old, yeah they want something from me
Why the flow so dummy, why do hoes still love me?
I don't know, don't bug me
I'm patron or bubbly or power, old culture
Ain't nobody sober
My mama don't drink but she kill me over soda
Damn homie, man you famous like Kony
My cousin bang Camp man (My cousin bang Camp man)
ATLien made it myself about a month
Just enough to get, to get my rows in a duck
Just enough to make a faithful man wanna fuck
Girls be tweetin' me their pictures, man I gotta look
And most of 'em couldn't handle the panels in my comic's book
This rapper's book, this writer's book
They kinda shook
It's not a hook

[Interlude]

[Hook]
I be killin' every nigga with bronchitises
I be killin' every nigga with bronchitises

// Wonderful //

[Hook: Josh Osho]
We finally made it
And now we sailin'
I never dreamed we'd get this far
My heart keeps asking
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful

[Verse: Childish Gambino]
You can call the shots, I'm going to my aunt's house
What's it all about? Lookin' like I'm Millhouse
What's it all about? I ain't get my bike back
I ain't get my bike back, I know where he live at
I know what he look like, I know what I live like
Five to a bed, head to toe, that's a good night
Five to a bed, head to toe, with the fan on
I don't think these other niggas know what your man on
I used to have to sneak just to get my food
Free lunch made it feel like they don't approve
Sell a card for a dollar used to be the mood
I wanna be Jabari man that nigga cool
I wanna lash out nigga keep your cool
All my friend did was draw something now he outta school
'Cause everything was always "Show me what you're made of"
And everybody knew somebody who was laid up
I didn't need it, momma said it's a lesson
Some people will never like you
Don't let 'em catch you stressin'
You know a code's a code, the world can't stop 'em
Eating out rat holes and Cheerios boxes
This nigga think he hot shit, he think he good at everything
I just didn't wanna get left out more
My little sis' mom got shot, she in the newspaper
Prayers couldn't save her, she died a day later
Like my cousin got the HIV
When she bust the leg open playing jump rope
Should I tell them kids what the fuck's up?
They gone judge her and me
Man fuck them, we livin', all is forgiven
I fucked up royally
But now that's who we are man you gotta use the royal "we"
This is royalty, and this is all I ever wanted 'cause

[Hook: Josh Osho (x2)]
We finally made it
And now we sailin'
I never dreamed we'd get this far
My heart keeps asking
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful
How did it get so wonderful? So wonderful

// Make It Go Right //

[Verse 1: Kilo Kish]
Umm, okay
Yea, candy
Uhh, where is this song in my Blackberry?
Yea, yea
Alright cool

Okay
As my mind runs, licking cotton candy lipstick
You're right here in my room, yeah I wished it
Candlelight vigil for the one you're texting
Pink sweatpants - hmm, interesting
No need, don't explain to me, love
Cause I know how you deal, but I could see us
In a different way, don't play me cause we're not the same
Sign on, choose your screename and misbehave
So you're a playboy, you think you're Hef K
Hoppin' round town with the bunnies when
I'm the candy that you need, brush your sweet tooth
Have you got it with your place with the statue?
A Veneer, I hear, she's just swell
If you want to date a rock, you think I can't tell?
So you bored? Are you lost? Was it worthwhile?
I feel the ice-cold chill in her warm smile
Saw you last night, you didn't have to act fly
Come and sweep me from the back room
Feel my palms heat up on your chest now
As the night creeps into bedtime vows
Married in a white t-shirt, bedstyle
Still you know that I'm the best ride
You deserve what you get: it's called respect
You ever heard of it?

[Hook]
I know what you're missing in your new life
I can find a way to make it go right
Make it go right
Make it go right
I know what you're missing in your new life
I can find a way to make it go right
It go, it go
It go, it go

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind, I hear my conscience call
I used to front somethin' stupid, now I'm makin' them wait
Except for you mama, I'm ready, I don't wanna be late
Never hesitate, you know it, petty cash, we blow it
Excuse me for imperfect, them halfway looks is worth it
I watched these niggas lurkin', they just want my leftovers
Watched 'em locked up all day and slept over
Put your hair back: Afro
Skippin' after-parties at the last show
I'ma hold your hand in little Tokyo
And tell you somethin' in your ear that you shouldn't know
Two jumps, but the feeling was so gone
High school swag, busy fuckin' with clothes on
Lost a couple words, joke around the reason
You can wear my shirt, pretend to let you win that FIFA
There was nothing like it... settle down
You always hit me when my boo around
It's a long walk - we ain't talkin' though
That ratchet ho on lock-n-load, I appreciate the offer, though
I'ma do it right - later, though
Cause either way you're gonna hate me like you say you won't
Thank God for that - it's called regret
You ever heard of it?

[Hook (x2)]
I know what you're missing in your new life
I can find a way to make it go right
Make it go right
Make it go right
I know what you're missing in your new life
I can find a way to make it go right
It go, it go
It go, it go

// Real Estate //

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
I got a PJ for the whole crew
Passport looking old news
Champagne in a glasshouse
Old money know what I'm about
Put your money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
I put my money in that real estate
Nigga I'm from Georgia that's the realest state

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
I'm feeling like New Zealand, charge it to the Am-X
Gotta use that latex or she living like a princess
They don't wake you up in private, let a nigga sleep
I got houses in the mountains, man Will Smith live down the street
Got that generation money my grandkids are assholes
Stacking something dummy every verse I got got cash flow
Monaco they loved me, I'm wearing something ugly
But they still know I'm rich though so my doo-rag lookin' stuffy
Rollin' with the royalty Kauai is just my Camelot
Glasshouse, champagne, white shirt, no socks, no top Saint Bart's
Pushin' 997's like I'm making fuckin' phone calls
Half a mill is low bar
Lot of diamonds light bright, whiskey older than Betty White
Spot me on Dalmatian coast, Croatian girls salvation us
Make something of myself man
Somebody let'em know, 'cuz it's that eastside nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Alley Boy]
Ridin' around with a whole meal, real estate can a nigga live
Gold slug no ice grill, deal with molly, no ecs pill
Georgia nigga I'm A-town, eastside nation wide
Rep nigga like Tim Briggs, killed them, homicide
Real estate that's my estate Georgia pizza like Big Meech
Mason Ave, that's my street, we sellin' crack on Front Street
Old money got dust on it, old chopper got rust on it
New crib, ticket on it, just cashed out seven figures on it
Baby momma, stank bitch fought child support, I'm too rich
Pissy hoe got lucky, you can pay your bills on my dick
My driver license's suspended, but I'm still ridin' in a Bentley
I'm still strapped with that semi, real estate we winnin'
Me and Childish Gambino, plenty chips no casino
Poppin' bottles with models they gon' suck us up pronto
Put my grill in your real estate, know I come from that realest state
Niggas eating off paper plates, we just copped them new Audi 8s

[Hook (x2)]

[Outro 1: Swank]
Man Atlanta showing love too, man
Shout out to Eastside, shout out to Southside, Westside
And for the North side, man them niggas up there be testin'
Ain't nothing changed man, we still get money out here
Royalty forever in this bitch
Gambino nigga, you know what I'm saying?
That new shit man
One time for the one time man, real nigga stand up
Two times for the bad bitches, three for the rich
You know what I'm talking about?
You know what it is man, yeah man
Money talk, bullshit walkin' marathon
Real niggas know what I'm talking about
Royalty forever motherfucker
Gambino forever motherfucker
Get used to it, Royalty nigga, Royalty motherfucker
Motherfucking eastside stand up, Stone Mountain, L-town
We in this bitch like we fucking a dog or some shit my nigga
Man y'all motherfuckers already know what it is
Royalty forever in this bitch, bitch niggas fall back
Real recognize real and y'all sucka niggas ain't it
You feel me? Man don't watch me, watch TV
Wait, 'Bino on that shit too, God damn
Man we gettin' that white people money, you heard that?
Matter of fact Tina, tell these niggas what I'm talking about one time

[Outro 2: Tina Fey]
Yeah we in here, we in this thing
Gambino is forever, Royalty is forever
We ballin' 'till we fuckin' up the hardwood homey
This is the life we live, son
My president is black and my Prius is blue motherfucker
Royalty all day, we droppin' racks in Nordstroms son
That's racks on racks damn it
You feel me? You feel me?
This is the part where most people would say something crazy and drop the n-word after it
Not going to, not gonna do that
I don't feel comfortable
I'm out!
