// The Real (Infinity Guitars) //

Motherfuck a nigga
Hell yeah I do it bigger
I got eight figures like I'm skatin' in the winter
Niggas thought that I was kiddin'
These raps are not my sketches
I'm a sick boy, nigga, when I cough I hope you catch it
My germs in your system, now you coughin' like asthmatic
All of my "I'm tired of it" turns into your "Wish I had it"
I don't need this money, but I spend it like I wanna
She said this dick is hers, I don't wanna take it from her

Your dick stay chilly, it's a cold, rough world
I get superhero pussy, she a PowerPuff Girl
Shit just got real like Pinocchio turds
Yo nigga is Geppetto, I don't want no instrumentals
Leave the vocals on my shit
Like the song givin' me head
And your bitch can't sleep 'cause she used to my bed
She could have any dick, you just mad she chose-d mine
Schoolin' all you niggas and my mouth will make it Columbine
I am just a rapper, man, I ain't got no clothing line
My clothing line has closed the line and let me shop at closing time
Yo boy got stacks like I'm standin' in a Borders line
Hidin' from you bitches 'cause real nigga's hard to find
Work this shit like overtime
Yeah, my clothes are so designed
Closet look like Bloomingdale's, yo closet look like fashion jail
I break you out, I post for bail
This money make me Olsen twins, you call your bitch, you hearin' this
Uh uh uh

Yes it's necessary to be flier than canaries
Stay fresh to death like a mint cemetery
I do not talk, yeah my life a library
Eat her out and leave her cold, make that hole my Ben & Jerry's
Broke the mold on you bitches, man, I am so unique
You are not a rapper, if you were you'd hardly speak
I am Stone Mountain and I haven't reached my peak
Fuck her like I'm mad at her then I turn the other cheek

This shit is amazing, check me in my sweater, man
Comme des GarÃ§ons, bitch, nobody do it better, man
But I do it better, man
When it comes to pussy girls whisper in my ear "No one else can do this to me"
You's a cutie but you gotta know I'm married to my work
And these niggas ain't shit so I guess they must be urine
Gotta gift this bitch, like Christmas, bitch
I'm a act and rap, Will Smith this bitch
When rappers start rappin' over indie shit
Just remember I was first to hit this shit
The difference is I'm different, bitch
How the fuck can these niggas be dickless pricks?
Man, what the fuck you gon' do?
I don't need to talk to you
I am just a rapper too

// Get It (Tightrope) //

Childish Gambino, doper than twenty kilos
Feeling me no Aveeno, pardon me that's my ego
Nigga, I'm on, my swagga on He-Man
Down for Community, these other niggas Glee fans
You cannot see me you are blind like Venetians
Eyes wide open, nigga stay focused
Batman on these niggas, I am tired of these jokers
And my brain is too expressive and your mind is on the local

Motherfucker, I ain't playing
Ironic, I am Childish
Addressin' all you niggas, now you motherfuckers stylish
And get me any indie song, I promise to annihil' it
My mouth will kill everyone, I guess that bitch Annihilus

Yeah my girls are the wildest, they're in love with a weirdo
I am so different I am ProtÃ©gÃ©, my hero
Self-made phenom, green like tree frogs
Save every penny like Inspector Gadget reruns

My name is Donald Glover
Talented motherfucker
Childish is my cover
To hide this shit from my mother
She can't know how I'm livin'
I'm drinkin' and fuckin' women
And she is Jehovah Witness
And don't believe in all this shit

But I gotta handle business, kick it like soccer
Upper-class Kit-Kat, break 'em off proper
I am just a rapper, Sick Boy is my clique man
You are not a Sick Boy, you are just a sick man

Take some Dimetapp, yeah these hoes a dime-a-tap
'Less you get caught by them bitches, better keep your penis wrapped
Then you are just a rapper, the sky is the limit
Don't put nothing on the game just put something back in it

// Different (Feel It All Around) //

[Verse 1: D.C. Pierson]
Y'all know the name
No action, all flame
It's D to the C, no practice, all game
And not the game that your computer came installed with
So ditch the lame Twit you are currently involved with
The Derrick Boys a bunch of crazy brothers like the Baldwins
Echo motherfucker, you are just another dolphin
Hello motherfucker, like I walked in on incest
Do it motherfucker, talking does not impress
Us, man, us
It's all about us
Like them self absorbed teen girls talking on the bus
We trust you to pay when we ask you to pay
Til then, Chili Peppers, we give it away
I don't fuck the fans, I am not the industry
Man, I hate it when the man comes between you and me
I don't masturbate, I give a handjob to a star and
Picture you bumping out this anthem in your car
Still showing up for our dorks, geeks, losers
Rode out from New York on six beach cruisers
And if we could we'd ride with every kid right on the handlebars
We are just some rappers like some fat kid ate the candy bars

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Yes I'm back with a whole new attitude
Flier than a Cardinal, check my fuckin' latitude
Yes I'm so sick man, somebody call the doctor
Girls stay wet like I'm fucking with a lobster
I stopped talking I'm tired of paying em lip service
Switched over from street niggas to hipsters
I am so different, Donald Glover in the bitch
I don't need to use my rapper name, that's just Childish
And they used to call me Oreo, dunk me in that milk
Maybe then I will be white enough to hang out with them kids
They have to call you names when they don't know what you are
Now they know just what I are, baby girl I am a star
APC kicks, looking like a British boy
More money means more problems, I have been annoyed
Dude mad bout the girl that I came with
I'm fly, she fly, you are just penguin
I am just a rapper so I don't speak English
I just go hard like the traffic light changes
Sick boy, bitch, we the clique like seat belts
Yes I'm on fire I don't have to ask how heat felt
When I was 14, man nobody else was thinking this
A nigga off the chain, man I Abraham Lincoln'd this

I am just different
Motherfucker, I'm different
Yeah, I am just different
Yeah, I am just different

// What The Fuck Are You? (Colouring Of Pigeons) //

I do not talk, I am just a rapper

I am so different, being me is like the lottery
I am so on like the TV when you fall asleep
Niggas makin pottery, but I broke the mold
Now shit has got them dancing like I channel open fold

Yes, I got a lust for life, and I drink my weight in whiskey
And these hoes are actin' different cause I'm Rich comma Richie
These friends are iffy, they're alcoholic geniuses
I think they hang around until I'm drunk and buy them Guinnesses
I gotta drink my medicine to cover what's inside of me
I'm still fucked up from the days nobody liked me
I'm lying just a little when I say that I don't give a fuck
You know I gotta give a fuck

My face is broken out
My shirt is hand-me-down
This kid named Vincent wanna take my shit and lay me out
I'm trying to fit in like a fat bitch in her shoe size
It's funny I'm flyer now than witches on their broom rides
I always thought these new clothes were the potion
Cause I never felt that good in my own skin
It's probably cause I'm the only black kid in my school
And when I meet another black kid they tell me I'm a fool
Cause I wear thee tight clothes, tight jeans, tight shirt
Yeah I stay tight like these girls that make my dick hurt
Yeah, I'm self conscious
Go ahead - laugh it up
Cause I dig deep and pull something out to back it up

They told my ass ain't black enough
What the fuck are you?
You don't even say shit
Quit writing gay shit
Now they see me and have to squint like asians
Cause I'm on fire and everything I touch is blazing
Giving you the realness
Kid I got a lot of it
Listen to my mixtapes, tell me if they contradict
Don't fuck with these niggas cause this swag is asinine
I don't have time to eat
I don't have time to sleep
These niggas got time to do
Everything but be unique
I gotta do me like I'm jerkin' in the mirror
I am just a rapper
Can't make it clearer
Yes I'm in the building
No I own the company
Your girlfriend's sister...you cannot fuck with me

Childish Gambino
We are all children
I am just a murderer
We have just killed them

// Both Hands (Black Rainbow) //

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
These guys aren't tough-n-stuff
They can talk that shit when the chips are up
But, the chips are down, because I put them there
And I got a hot chip like the indie band
This is Christmas man and my flow is Miami
And the only goal that I have is my Emmy bitch
Yes, and a nigga stay down like I'm in a ditch
These niggas never did shit different, I was tired of it
See the other side of it
Hate how they say how hip-hop is dead and everybody is the same now
I am not the same, how could I ever be?
I am so fly and on fire like a phoenix wing
I go light speed, you go slow pace
And I go hard like G-O in bold face
Used to do me because I had to, now a nigga like to
Cause I get cheese like the mice do
I am a work of art, Crush niggas like I'm crushing on Annie Clark
They stop sleeping on me, good morning, like Alonzo
Go ahead and cut that shit out like a tonsil
Yes I stay weird and fuck chicks like I'm Gonzo
Sleeping on a Cow Pie, tired of the bullshit
Dick is her baby, why does she abuse it?
Eight shots and a beer and I'm passing out
Glasses, leather jacket, I'm a ask you out
Spend the night if you got your own tooth brush
I really think I like you, but not too much
I got big plans, yeah I feel myself hard like both hands
Yeah, I feel myself hard like both hands

[Musical Intermission: St. Vincent]
"Throw the phone out the window
If you want the neighbors woke
You'll have to shout out loud
And set the bed alight and slow
If you want the neighbors woke
You'll have to shout even louder"

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
This is all fun, yeah, my work is Vacation
Me and six shots, that's a bad combination
I don't need your money, this is free downloading
Play it at a party, watch it pop like a soda
Thick, indie, black chick, double stuffed Oreo
Make I shit rapped pissed off like a urinal
You can not see me, I can change your prospective
Sick boy, click. That's an Animal Collective
Fuckin' with your world, like I don't need protection
I am just a rapper, I'm in such a perfection
Spit hot shit, yeah, my mouth is a toaster
Shit look easy like a turd in a short skirt
I am not a fairy tail, I've earned this shit
Leave a track on the stove and watch me burn this bitch
Sick as a dog, fly as an angel
I am just a rapper, better learn sign language
Cause I don't talk, yeah I fight till that rec spin
Yeah I got paper like I just ate a muffin
This is all wrong man, this is all wrong
Every nigga have and hit, and then they sing the same song
That is so not me, I'm a change it all up
Doctor knows I'm sick dude, I don't need a follow up
Tell me when you can't take the track any longer
Weird SoufflÃ© and the noise makes me stronger
I have gotten stronger, tongue like a shot gun
If you let the track loose, you can watch me pop one
Sick boy bitch, and it's back to the future
Cause I'm McFly and it's not what I'm used to
Cause the used to call me other name of a rooster
Sky is the limit, like a jet pack booster
Fuckin' with a nigga like he fuckin' with a time bomb
Can't see a nigga mother fucker turn your eyes on
I am so different, you don't even know the half of
I do not talk, mother fucker I'm a Rapper!

// For The Fans (Warm Heart Of Africa) //

Childish Gambino, yeah, I got that swagger
Yeah, I hate her mad but it just don't matter
These girls all know that I got that cheddar
But it on a sandwich and eat it off a platter

My mouth vacationin', chillin' on her lawn
It's amazing how I'm off but I'm on
Lame niggas try to make a move like pawn
I'm the one and only Bambino fawn

Give me that track, man, leave it to professionals
I am just a rapper, man, talk like a vegetable
Don't be surprised, my face don't change
A nigga make waves like a baseball game

I'm a do me so hard I'll get pregnant
Will I have another me? Nigga, trick question
There's only one of me like the G in this sentence
G for Gambino, wear a crown like dentures

Thanks to the fans, love ya like family
No I don't remember when my mouth lost it's sanity
Nerdy girls, hipster, Frye boots, hoodie
Make me wanna fuck the whole word in a good way

And if I can't say he is so handsome
Get like me, that's the sick boy anthem
I am just a rapper, so I'm not speakin'
And I won't stop like a vampire's weekend
Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick...

(Is hip-hop hereditary? I don't know
Oh, the boys move fast, you should take it slow
Well, we all need someone to tell us when to go
A beat-box imaginary in the show
All your shell-toes lined up in a row
All your favorite breaks, your favorite ELO)

// Nowhere To Go (Disaster Babe) //

[Hook x2]
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go
I'm so drunk tonight and I
I don't got nowhere to go

[Verse 1]
Childish Gambino
I'm trying to hold my liquor
A vomit stain on my t-shirt
A sick boy but getting sicker
I don't really wanna take another marijuana
But I do it cause I'm stupid and it hits me I'm a goner

[Hook x2]
