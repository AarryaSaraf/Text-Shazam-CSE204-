// Homeless //

Mmm...
Whoa oh...

Could I wake up next to you
When it's hitting double figures
Look into your eyes
Like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer
Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn
It's hers to get hurt
On a late night
Coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face
I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine
Smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines

Hey....

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three AM
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again

'Cause it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me yeah...

And now I'm sitting on a night bus
Flicking through my iPod
Feeling kinda tired
So I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off
Lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one
Gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to Uni
People see right through me
but I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one
Gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to
Except get a 2:1

I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three AM
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again

'Cause it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me yeah...


When I feel cold
You keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate
Who wants to be my duvet hey-eh

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be

And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be [6x]
And it's not a homeless life for me Yeah...mm..oh.

// Sofa //

She's reinventing loving me
When we're resembling cutlery
On the sofa
It must have been
About 5:01
Like my blue ripped jeans

And my eyes are closed
And I'm way too tired
Hoody still smells of the beach bonfire

On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And it's cold outside again
And we're both so high

We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with you

When the morning comes
We're not watching Formula One
It's not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on T4
Two, boiled and brew
Two sugars ain't too sweet for you

On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And it's cold outside, again
And we're still so high

We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want
Say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with you

And it feels like I'm flying
And it feels like

We could go to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
Through the streets of New York
That is where I will take ya
Paris, Rome, to Rio
Passing through Las Vegas
We can go where you want
Say the word, and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa
On the sofa, with you

// One Night //

Lying in a bedroom
Lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing
So I cut it with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention
As she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency
To finish off a sentence

Oh well, sheâs a local girl
No make-up
Cause she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man

Is it fast food?
Iâll regret it after
And I needed money
But Iâm too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her that I love her
And sheâs all I need
I take it with a cold glass
Of the fruit and the barley
Sheâs still a sucker for the
Apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party
Sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio
It makes me feel naughty and lastly

She knows me well
Bit of a catch
To have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek
For her one-night man

I donât wanna go alone
I donât wanna go alone
No, I don't wanna go alone

Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that sheâs more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that sheâs more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you donât, Iâll tell her myself

And weâve got that love in us
So if the drink kill us
Weâre gonna dance all night
Till the floor fillers
If we talk outside
Say I hate wasps too
I donât really dance
So Iâll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight?
Tell me if thatâs alright
I donât wanna be here
Iâm not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush
You donât mind sharing
She said I wanna take off
What youâre wearing

And I donât wanna go alone
I donât wanna go alone
I donât wanna go alone, oh.

Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that sheâs more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that sheâs more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you donât, Iâll tell her myself

Sheâs like the fast food
Iâll regret it after
And I needed money
But Iâm too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that sheâs all I need

Tell her that I
Tell her that I
Tell her that sheâs more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I
Tell her that I
Tell her that sheâs more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you donât, Iâll tell her myself

Now tell her that I love her
Tell her that I need her
That sheâs more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near

Tell her that I want her
Tell her that I need her
Tell her that sheâs more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you donât, Iâll tell her myself

// Firefly //

I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits
Light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew your heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet
Underneath shooting stars
If it helps you sleep

And hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe

[2x]
There's a firefly
Loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes

Teach my skin
Those new tricks
Warm me up
With your lips
Heart to heart
Melt me down
It's too cold
In this town
Close your eyes
Lean on me
Face to mouth
Lips to cheek
Feeling numb
In my feet
You're the one
To help me get to sleep

And hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe

[2x]
There's a firefly
Loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes

It's only been
One night of love
And maybe
That is not enough

Hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe

It's only been
One night of love
And maybe
That is not enough

Hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe

[2x]
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes

// The City (Live At Sticky Studios) //

This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
With my hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Don't control what I'm into

London calls me a stranger
A traveller
This is now my home, my home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
The shop across the road
Fulills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger
A traveller
This is now my home, home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along

I'm from a city where the rain won't cease
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives
Can't resort to arrogance with white lies
This city won't erase me
But I can't help to see how this dark city changed me
It's all the same scene, music is my life
But now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West, London's my home now
Knees weak, but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
And stay away from all the negative shit that will follow me

London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
