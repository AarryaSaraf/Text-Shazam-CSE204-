// Spark //

We've been lost for a long time
In a rut, no escape signs
And for love, we were so blind
Oh, I hate to see you cry
There've been times where the truth lied
Now it's clear as a blue sky

Like a Band-Aid over deeper cuts, we tried
But couldn't stop the fate descending on the night

We'll build a fire and torch our old lives
And hope the spark survives
Use words as kindling
Light up the night sky
Let the memories take flight
And hope the spark survives
Yeah, we hope the spark survives

Oh, I wonder will we pull through?
All we ever do is argue
With not a lot, but we make do
How I wish you wouldn't say that
There are things you can't take back
When you leave, I always face facts

Like a hand that's trying to hold the water back
Couldn't stop the ocean leaking in the cracks

We'll build a fire and torch our old lives
And hope the spark survives
Use words as kindling
Light up the night sky
Let the memories take flight
And hope the spark survives
Yeah, we hope the spark survives

We've taken roads (We've taken roads)
That led to confusion
But right now that don't matter at all (Nah, nah)
We'll bring it back (We'll bring it back)
Our love's no illusion
The higher we go, the harder we fall and now

We'll build a fire and torch our old lives
And hope the spark survives
Use words as kindling
Light up the night sky
Let the memories take flight
And hope the spark survives
Yeah, we hope the spark survives
And we hope the spark survives

// You Need Me, I Don't Need You //

Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now

Oh oh

See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse
Hell, don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer - you're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe

And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
'A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi'

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop 'til my name's in lights
At stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out, wow
From day one, I've been prepared
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa, giving a dose of what the future holds
'Cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper's shoes using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Rufio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

// The City //

This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when itâs late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I canât close my eyes
Donât control what Iâm into
And this tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
The sleep fills my mind
Can't control what Iâm into

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home

Iâm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
Iâm blazing on the street
What I do isnât up to you
If the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what Iâm used to
The shop across the road
Fills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I donât think Iâm gonna make it
Past tomorrow

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home

Iâm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
Iâm blazing on the street
What I do isnât up to you
If the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along

London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home

Iâm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
Iâm blazing on the street
What I do isnât up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two

// Sunburn //

Youâre not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see, Iâm searching for what used to be mine

And I saw your eyes
And I saw Alice staring back at me
So I will try to find another one who suited me as well as her

I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things arenât clear

When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
Iâd miss you
And I miss you

She was mine
I was hers and all thatâs in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her and keep her from the darkness that will be

If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things arenât clear

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
Iâd miss you
And I miss you

Donât drop me in
Itâs not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
That you scarred and left me
Like a sunburn

Donât drop me in
Itâs not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
That you scar and leave me
Like a sunburn

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
Iâd miss you
And I miss you

// The A Team //

White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye
And hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life come free to us
And we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
To fly, fly
For angels to fly, to fly, to fly
For angels to die

// Little Bird //

If we take this bird in
With its broken leg
We could nurse it
She said
Come inside
For a little lie down with me
If you fall asleep
It wouldnât be the worst thing

But when I wake up
Your make-up is on my shoulder
And tell me, if I lie down
Would you stay now
And let me hold you?

But if I kissed you
Will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do
And itâs not complete yet
Mustnât get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret
Diving in too soon
And Iâll owe it all to you
My little bird
My little bird

If we take a walk out
In the morning dew
We could lay down
So Iâm next to you
Come inside
For a little home-made tea
If you fall asleep
Then at least youâre next to me

And if I wake up
You see, itâs late, love
Go back to sleep
Iâm covered by nature
And Iâm safe now
Underneath this oak tree
With you beside me

But if I kissed you
Will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do
And itâs not complete yet
Mustnât get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret
Diving in too soon
And Iâll owe it all to you
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird

And of all these things
Iâm sure of
Iâm not quite certain
Of your love
And you made me scream
But then I made you cry
When I left that little bird
With its broken leg to die

But if I kissed you
Will your mouth read this truth?
Darling, how I miss you
Strawberries taste how lips do
And itâs not complete yet
Mustnât get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret
Diving in too soon
But Iâll owe it all to you
My little bird
My little bird whoa oh oh
My little bird
My little bird
Youâre my little bird

// Drunk //

I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me,
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make up
Lips sticks to me, so now I maybe lean back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

But a house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat in
'Cause you take parts of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me? '

Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again, I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I got no plans for the weekend, so should we speak then?
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to

There may be other people like us
Who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up
Flames just create us but burns don't heal like before
And you don't hold me anymore

On cold days cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make

Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again, I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

All by myself, I'm here again
All by myself, you know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself

I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

// UNI //

I found your hair band on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you'd been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides
In my eyes
Never getting dry,
So I get high,
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night

I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall
With the head spin I got,
My mind's with you but my heart's just not

So am I close to you anymore if it's over?
And there's no chance that we'll work it out

That's why you and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

Everybody said we'd be together forever,
But I know that I never wanna settle down,
Come around, break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another like you
Sleep with my thoughts
And I dance with my views
Everything's great, not everything's sure,
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in a position to be another stalker
Like everything I say seems to all sound awkward
Like our last kiss. It was perfect,
But we were nervous on the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it,
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant
Or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss

So am I close to you anymore if it's over?
And there's no chance that we'll work it out

You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

Wo-ooooahhhh [2x] oohh ohh

Because if I was gonna go somewhere,
I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down
And I'm thinking that I'm unaware,
I keep my feet on the ground
And keep looking around
To make sure I'm not the only one to feel low

Because if you want,
I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I know you'll say
That I'm the only one,
But I know God made another one of me to love you better than I ever will

'Cause you and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over U N I
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied

// Grade 8 //

My mind is a warrior,
My heart is a foreigner,
My eyes are the colour of red like a sunset,
I'll never keep it bottled up
And left to the hands of the coroner,
Be a true heart not a follower,
We're not done yet.

And I see it in your movements tonight,
If we should ever do this right,
I'm never gonna let you down,
Oh I'll never let you down,
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around so I'll know
That I'll never let you down,
I'll never let you down.

You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,
Now you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,

Now, my eyes are a river filler,
This drink is a liver killer,
My chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest again,
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is my new best friend,
Your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again,

Now I see it in your movements tonight,
If we should ever do this right,
I'm never gonna let you down,
Oh I'll never let you down,
We'll keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around so I'll know
That I'll never let you down,
I'll never let you down,

You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,

Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll never let you down [x4]

'Cause You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,
You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8 but I've never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let you down,

// Wake Me Up //

I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand,
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
And fill it up with bubbles

'Cause maybe you're lovable
And maybe you're my snowflake
When your eyes turn from green to gray
In the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder

And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me?
Could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way?
And I know you love Shrek
'Cause we've watched it 12 times
But maybe you're hoping for a fairy tale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a Blu-ray, true say

And now I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I'd go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you'd laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you'd lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets

And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I'll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like a necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe
To feel my heart against yours now, against yours now

'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up

// This //

This is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
You are the one who'd make me lose it all
You are the start of something new, ooh

And I'll throw it all away
And watch you fall into my arms again
And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall, now

You are the earth that I will stand upon
You are the words that I will sing

And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall into his arms again
And I've thrown it all away
Watched you fall, now

And take me back
Take me home
Watch me fall
Down to earth
Take me back for

This is the start of something beautiful
You are the start of something new

// Lego House //

I'm gonna pick up the pieces and build a Lego house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings but there's one thing on my mind
It's all for you

And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on, now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now, now

I'm gonna paint you by numbers and colour you in
If things go right we can frame it and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now

Don't hold me down, I think the braces are breaking and it's more than I can take

And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on, now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind,
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down

[Album version ending:]
And out of all these things I've done, I will love you better now

[Music video version ending:]
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I will love you better now

// Kiss Me //

One, two, three, four

Settle down with me
Cover me up
Cuddle me in

Lie down with me
And hold me in your arms

And your heart's against my chest, your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love

Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady

I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms

Oh no
My heart's against your chest, your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet
And with this feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love

Yeah I've been feeling everything
From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth
I guess that's how I know you
So I hold you close to help you give it up

So kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
Falling in love
We're falling in love

// Give Me Love //

Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go

And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, give me love

Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go

You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh give me love

Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love

M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover

M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (love me, love me, love me)

M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love)
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love)
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love, love me)
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love)

My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love

// The Parting Glass //

Of all the money that e'er I had
I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you all

// Autumn Leaves //

Another day, another life
Passes by just like mine
It's not complicated

Another mind, another soul
Another body to grow old
It's not complicated

Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down
Like autumn leaves
And hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Another tear, another cry
Another place for us to die
It's not complicated

Another love that's gone to waste
Another light lost from your face
It's complicated

Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?
Float down
Like autumn leaves
And hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Ooh how I miss you
My symphony played the song that carried you out
Ooh how I miss you
And I, I miss you and I wish you'd stay

Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down
Like autumn leaves
And hush now
Close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Ooh oh, ooh oh
Ooh oh, ooh oh

Touch down
Like a seven four seven
Stay out and we'll live forever now

// Gold Rush //

Smoke alarm went off at 9
I woke up, wiped the sleep out of my eyes
She left a note "I'll be back in 5"
Well, I'm still waiting for that moment to arrive, hey

I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do

But I do it for the love
Waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge
Smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends
All they say is "Hold up
And remember the time
When we were in school
Listening to grown-ups.
Didn't learn a thing
But then again, you know what,
You know how to sing
But you don't know anything
Other than that.

So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way...
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way...
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way...
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
You wanna be loved."

I never told her that I liked
The way she dances slightly out of time
And pretends she knows the words
To a song she's never heard
But I tell her all the time, hey

I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do

But I do it for the love
Waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge
Smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends
All they say is "Hold up
And remember the time
When we were in school
Listening to grown-ups.
Didn't learn a thing
But then again, you know what,
You know how to sing
But you don't know anything
Other than that.

So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way...
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way...
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way...
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
You wanna be loved, hey."

But I do it for the love
Waiting on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge
Smoking on a roll up
When I see my friends
All they say is "Hold up
And remember the time
When we were in school
Listening to grown-ups.
Didn't learn a thing
But then again, you know what,
You know how to sing
But you don't know anything
Other than that.

So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way...
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way...
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way...
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
You wanna be loved."

// Eraser //

I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the lord's house
But stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now, the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy, when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me, is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride

You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead I look in the mirror, questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day, for someone like me
Without a nine to five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors I'll find another use for the key, and you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more
I am another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own so here I'll stay
Save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the picture perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the route of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fix, they break as well
And ain't nobody want to see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream and this should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm reverend run
I beg you don't be disappointed with the man I've become

Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12, telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people dad and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley stadium crowds, two hundred and forty thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now, somehow

I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more
I am another one to take the sting away
Oh I am happy on my own so here I'll stay
Well save your loving arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
Where I'm heading who knows
My heart will stay the same

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
Where I'm heading who knows
My pain eraser

And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

// Castle On The Hill //

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down

I was younger then
Take me back to when

I found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night
I don't reckon that I did it right

I was younger then,
Take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long
Oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way
I still remember these old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way
You make me feel
And it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

// Dive //

Maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologise for it

I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
10,000 rocks on the lake

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

You're a mystery
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you, no one
What's your history?
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
Cause I heard you do

I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at
Every mess that I made

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you

// Shape Of You //

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (mmmm)
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mmmm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now (mmmm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date (mmmm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (mmmm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay (mmmm)
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

// Perfect //

I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it,
Darling, you look perfect tonight

Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress
Looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight

No, no, no

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight

// Galway Girl //

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs do you want to drink on?

She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called, was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to CÃ¨ilidh, singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me, you know

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

My pretty little Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl

Now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night

I walked her home then she took me inside
Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm going to put you in a song that I write
About a Galway girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

My pretty little Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl

// Happier //

Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arms
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier

Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal baby
If you're moving on with someone new

Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier
Aren't you?

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you

// New Man //

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I heard he's on a new diet and watches what he eats

He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy so that's fine by me

But still, I'm just keeping it real, still looking at your Instagram and I'll be creeping a little
I'll be trying not to double tap, from way back, cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when you used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't superman, just a young boy trying to be loved
So let me give it to you

I don't wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the burb, and wears a man bag on his shoulder but I call it a purse
Every year he goes to Malaga, with all the fellas, drinks beer but has a six pack, I'm kind of jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors in winter at nighttime, and every time a rap song comes on
He makes a gun sign, says chune, boydem light up the room
But enough about him, girl let's talk about you
You were the type of girl that sat beside the water reading
Eating a packet of crisps but you will never find you cheating
Now you're eating kale, hitting the gym, keeping up with Kylie & Kim
In the back of the club kissing a boy that ain't him
Ok you need to be alone, and if you wanna talk about it you can call my phone
I just thought that I would tell you cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl trying to be loved
So let me give it to you

I don't wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not trying to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him I know you're lonely
Please, remember you're still free, to make the choice and leave
And don't call me up you need to show me

I don't wanna know about your new man, cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to
Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

I don't wanna know about your new man, we'll get there eventually
I know you're missing all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Know about me, know, know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man, he don't wanna know

// Hearts Don't Break Around Here //

She is the sweetest thing that I know
You should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pot hole, every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
Unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

That every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah

She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell, fill my lungs
Spent my summer time beside her
And the rest of the year the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame
Oh roses roses laid upon your bed spread
Oh my, hold this, oh this, I know

That every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah yeah

Well I found love in the inside
The arms of a woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night that will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
Because from now until I go

Every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah

Every night I'll kiss you you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love aren't we?
Hands in your hair, fingers and thumbs baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Yeah yeah yeah
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

// What Do I Know? //

Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, "Son, don't you get involved
In politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels."

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene,
I know when I have children, they will know what it means
And I'll pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love and understanding positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Saying love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?

Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fitting in your jeans
It's love and understanding positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Saying love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?

Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene,
You know the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understanding positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talking about exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Saying love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?

Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?

// How Would You Feel (Paean) //

You are the one girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in the front yard
We got questions we should not ask but

How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

In the summer, as the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you
We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms round you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon

How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in the front yard
We got questions we should not ask but

How would you feel, if I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too

// Supermarket Flowers //

I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day-old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved

Took the "Get Well Soon" cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But, mom, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces. It's tearing me up but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So, I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John said he'd drive, then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So, I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go 
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"

Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back, he said, "Hallelujah, you're home"

// Barcelona //

Well get up up on the dancefloor tonight
I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
Are in my blood, both hands upon her waistline
Get on up baby dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Place don't close until we wanna leave it

You and I we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes, and let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona

Well get up up on the dancefloor, move, it's a Saturday night
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
Reflected in your beautiful eyes, I guess that is destiny doing it right
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you baby, solamente

You and I we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes, and let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Oh Barcelona

So let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona
Las Ramblas, I'll meet you, we'll dance around La Sagrada Familia
Drinking Sangria, mi niÃ±a, te amo mi cariÃ±o
Mamacita, rica, si tÃº, te adoro seÃ±orita
Los otros, viva la vida
Come on let's be free in Barcelona
Las Ramblas, I'll meet ya, come on and dance with me, in Barcelona
Drinking Sangria, I just want to be in Barcelona
Mamacita, rica, feel that summer breeze in Barcelona
Los otros, viva la vida, siempre vida Barcelona

// Bibia Be Ye Ye //

Bibia be ye ye
I lost my shoes last night
I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar upon my knuckle
And each graze upon my knee, and all I know is
I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, always say what's on your mind
And I am only, being honest with you, I I get lonely
And make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye (if thing's aren't working out)
Bibia Be Ye Ye (everything will be alright)
Bibia Be Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye Ye
Bibia Be Ye Ye

I remember less and less, and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans, are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams
And I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town
And spend the afternoon looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, always say what's on your mind
And I am only, being honest with you, I I get lonely
And make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye (if thing's aren't going well)
Bibia Be Ye Ye
Wo nooma (Be Ye Ye) (Your problems will be solved)
Wo nooma maaaa ye
Wo nooma (Be Ye Ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye
Wo nooma (Be Ye Ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye
Wo nooma (Be Ye Ye)
Wo nooma maaaa ye
Someone told me, always say what's on your mind

// Nancy Mulligan //

I was twenty four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty two grand kids now growing old
In the house that your brother bought ya

On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father but her daddy said, "No
You can't marry my daughter"

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

Well, I met her at Guy's in the second world war
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire, in our old armchairs
You know Nancy I adore ya

From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

// Save Myself //

I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles but would you do the same for me
Oh, honestly?

Offered up my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf, no farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon cause from here it looks the same?
And only scars remain

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf, no farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

But if I don't then I'll go back to where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving, just like that
Oh I'm here again, between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong, cause I'm not like my mum
Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song, but it helps
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
Or drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf, no farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself

// Tides //

I have grown up, I am a father now
Everything has changed, but I am still the same somehow
You know I've never been afraid of death
But now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet

I still love getting out of my mind, I should it cut down
I still know people I don't like and I should cut them out
I feel embarrassed 'bout the things that I did in my youth
'Cause now I have a child, I know one day that she'll go through it

Freight cargo, dot stops, and aeroplanes
Late night calls, signal is in and out again
Feeling low on serotonin and better days
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with me

Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changing tides

I lost the confidence in who I was
Too busy trying to chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes

I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace
Have no regrets but wish I did things in a different way

Low fly zone, lawsuits, and film stars
Headline wrote the princess and the face scar
Broken bones, break-ins, and Babylon
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with me

Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changing tides

Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changing tides

// Shivers //

I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then something more
Ooh yeah, I want it all

Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancing underneath the stars
Ooh yeah, I want it all

Mmm, you got me feeling like

I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I
Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singing like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

And we'll say
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough

You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough

Mmm, you got me feeling like

I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I
Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singing like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

And we'll say
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

Baby, you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the fire you got
This thing we started, I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver-er-er

Baby, you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the fire you got
This thing we started, I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver

Yeah, you got me singing like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back

(Oh no) And we'll say
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up
Give me the shivers
Oh baby, you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over then we'll bring it right back, hey

// First Times //

I thought it'd feel different playing Wembley
80,000 singing with me
It's what I've been chasing 'cause this is the dream

When it was all over, I cleared out the room
Grabbed a couple beers, just me and you
Then we start talking the way that we do

Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember

The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first drink, red wine, on a step in Brooklyn
I still feel the first fight, but we both made it out alive
And I can't wait to make a million more first times

The greatest thing that I have achieved
Is four little words down on one knee
You said, "Darling, are you joking?"
And I just said, "Please."

Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember

The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first look in your eyes when I said, "I love you."
I can still feel the butterflies from when we stumbled home that night
I can't wait to make a million more first times

Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember

The first kiss, first night, first song that made you cry
First dance in moonlight in your parents' garden
I can't wait to see everything that's yet to be
Our first child, and then a million more first times

// Bad Habits //

(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes stare into space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you

// Overpass Graffiti //

This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on
To rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip hip hooray love

Photographs in sepia tones
So still the fire is barely fighting the cold
Alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
But the cards were stacked against us both

I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full stop love that will never leave
And, baby, you will never be lost on me

This is a God damn shame
I never wanted to break it
And leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us
Or even erase us

The car was stuck, the engine stalled
Both of us got caught out in the snow
Alone
There were times when I forget the lows
And think the highs were all that we'd ever know
The cards were stacked against us both

I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Lost on me
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Lost on me

I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lost on me
Graffiti on the overpass

// The Joker And The Queen //

How was I to know?
It's a crazy thing
I showed you my hand
And you still let me win

And who was I to say
That this was meant to be?
The road that was broken
Brought us together

And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen

I was upside down
From the outside in
You came to the table
And you went all in

With a single word
And a gentle touch
You turned a moment
Into forever

And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen

And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I folded, you saw the best in me
The joker and the queen
The joker and queen

// Leave Your Life //

If I forget to say goodbye
Before I catch the plane
Would you know the way that I
Feel when I'm away?
We'll see the same sky tonight
But the stars are out of place
You'll never know the weight of my heart
Every time I leave you, babe

It's hard to break the landing
But I'll see you again

I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away
You are always on my mind
Forever and now I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day
But this love'll keep alight
I'm never gonna leave your life
I, I, I
I'm never gonna leave your life

Oh, I could never tell you, Ly
Or put in words your finest traits
The darkest green and hazel eyes
And yet I can't describe the shade
You are all this heart of mine
And there you will remain
You'll never know the weight of my decisions
When I leave your smiling face

It's hard to understand it
But I'll see you again

Oh, I
I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away
You are always on my mind
Forever and now I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day
But this love'll keep alight
I'm never gonna leave your life
I, I, I
I'm never gonna leave your life

It's hard to break the landing
But I'll see you again

I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away
You are always on my mind
Forever and now I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day
But this love'll keep alight
I'm never gonna leave your life
I, I, I
I'm never gonna leave your life

If I forget to say goodbye
Before I catch the plane
Would you know the way that I
Feel when I'm away?

// Collide //

Oh yeah, we've been in the rain
Been on the rocks but we found our way
We've ordered pizza to an aeroplane
Slept on the beach like we were castaways
We've been in the storm
Been to an Irish bar in central Rome
Driven to hospitals with broken bones
Shared a toothbrush and shared our home

We've seen the moon reflect on the rolling tide
Been up at 5AM watching the sunrise
Because the world looks better when I'm by your side
Oh I, oh I, oh I

When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
You bring me to life

When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
You bring me to life

We've been on the road
We've watched the blossom fall to earth like snow
Fumbled in cubicles in Tokyo
And been to funerals in rented clothes

We drank your father's whiskey when your grandma died
You brought me to the morning through my darkest night
Yeah, the world hurts less when I'm by your side
Oh I, oh I, oh I

When you and I collide
You bring me to life
You bring me to life
You bring me to life

When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life

Head first, colliding
Dreamers, colliding
Universe, colliding
Your love let the light in

Head first, colliding
Dreamers, colliding
Universe, colliding

We made love in the sky
Overslept and missed the Northern Lights
You lost your wedding ring but I didn't mind
'Cause I got a feeling, baby, we'll be fine

// 2step //

I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment

You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

'Cause we're living life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans, and not give a damn
If we're missing out on what the people think is right

Seeing through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays

And then we'll go all night

Two stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes
Electrified, we'll keep turning up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all
Night, night
Two stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us

What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark
And I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me

I feel like I've got nothing left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feeling like the best, and the rest are just less
Than she needs, so we press play and step to the beat

'Cause we're living life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans, and not give a damn
Head out to the place where it plays

And we'll go all night

Two stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes
Electrified, we'll keep turning up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all
Night, night

Two stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night

// Stop The Rain //

Another human cloud to bring you down
When you blew the last away
Bring out a poisoned tongue or plastic crown
But from here they look the same

Sometimes it can get all too much for me
And that's why the photograph gets burned
Throw the match in gasoline
Ay, ay

Don't let the ones who hurt you see you cry
Tomorrow is another day

You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holding an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Trying to find something real
But it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Another I, Me, Mine to blur the lines
Between love and then heartbreak
It's a lonely life thinking you're right
And always shifting blame

Every time it's getting more and more ugly
And that's why the photograph gets burned
Throw the match in gasoline
Ay, ay

Don't let them tell you keep it all inside
I know the winds have got to change

You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holding an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Trying to find something real
But it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And it seems like time
Could be so much more than a wakeup call to live real life
Every day is a chance that we can start over
Read my mind
There'll be ups and downs, but it won't change a thing between you and I
There's one thing I can't change

You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holding an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Trying to find something real
But it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel

You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holding an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Trying to find something real
But it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can't stop the rain, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can't stop the rain, yeah
Can't stop the rain (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can't stop the rain
Can't stop the rain (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, can't stop the rain (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

// Love In Slow Motion //

It's been a while since we've been alone
So turn off the world and the telephone
I need to tell you you're beautiful
'Cause it's been a while
And I apologise

I just get caught up in the rat race I'm running
Chasing a moment I'm hoping is coming
If I stopped and took a look around
It's in front of my eyes, eyes

Baby, let's slow down time
Maybe just press rewind
Darling, that dress reminds
Me of the first time

And I wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over we spend our lives
Living fast forward
But not tonight
Love in slow motion

It's been a while since it was you and me
Too many friends, too many evening drinks
Yeah, we commit to so many things
But not to ourselves
And I apologise

Sometimes you're sad and you tell me it's nothing
And I brush it off because there's always something
But I need to change my perspective
And prioritise, -ise

There's one thing I know, it's this
Every moment missed
Can be restored with your lips
It only takes one kiss

And I wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over we spend our lives
Living fast forward
But not tonight
Love in slow motion

Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

Love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over we spend our lives
Living fast forward
But not tonight
Love in slow motion

Wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
In slow motion
In slow motion

// Visiting Hours //

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's getting older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you

Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I hadn't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right

Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turning out a failure
You'd say, "Remember that the answer's in the love that we create"
So much has changed since you've been away

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own

And I will close the door, but I will open up my heart
And everyone I love will know exactly who you are
'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just 'til we meet again
So much has changed since you've been away

// Sandman //

You were loved before you had arrived
And every day that love just multiplies
Daddy made your bed and your lullaby
And Mumma made the mobile in the sky
Loving you is easy
But life will not always be
Fall into the world of your song
Whatever you feel can never be wrong

Come along for the ride
And in a shake of a lamb's tail we'll go
Be still now and close your eyes

And dream
Hanging out with the sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hanging out with the sandman
Though there's rain outside, you'll be warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my love
Hanging out with the sandman

Chocolate covered roof and candy cars
Rainbow sugar river we can sail upon
Marshmallow books and strawberries
Snowmen made of ice cream
Over the flower fields we'll fly
We'll count the fish in the sky
Honeybees and birds, sing your song
Whatever you feel can never be wrong

Come along for the ride
And in a shake of a lamb's tail we'll go
Be still now and close your eyes

And dream
Hanging out with the sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hanging out with the sandman
Though there's rain outside, you'll be warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my love
Hanging out with the sandman

Come along for the ride
And in a shake of a lamb's tail we'll go
Be still now and close your eyes

And dream
Hanging out with the sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hanging out with the sandman
Though there's rain outside, you'll be warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my love
Hanging out with the sandman

Hanging out with the sandman
Hanging out with the sandman
Hanging out with the sandman

// Be Right Now //

A lifetime is starting to feel like
It's falling short of the mark
But it's all that we got
Every teardrop, every wrong turn
Made the moment we found
And it's coming around, around, around, around, around

I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothing but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now

The shadows cling to the ceiling
And fracture the light that lands in our eyes
Every moment changes the whole view
And just when it ends
I feel it again, again, again, again, again

I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothing but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now

Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters
Stay here and be right now

Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters
Nothing else matters
Stay here and be right now

I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothing but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now

// Merry Christmas //

Build a fire and gather 'round the tree
Fill a glass and maybe come and sing with me

So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas

We'll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the best of all
I wish you could see it through my eyes then you would know
My God! You look beautiful right now
Merry Christmas

The fire is raging on
And we'll all sing along to the song
Just having so much fun
While we're here, can we all spare a thought
For the ones who have gone?
Merry Christmas, everyone

(Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah)

So just keep kissing me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas

We'll dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the best of all
I wish you could see it through my eyes then you would know
My God! You look beautiful right now
Merry Christmas

I feel it when it comes
Every year, helping us carry on
Filled up with so much love
All the family and friends are together
Where we all belong
Merry Christmas, everyone

(Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah)

It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a merry Christmastime time

// Afterglow //

(One, two)

Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle
Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing, Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I

We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle
Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

// One Life //

It's such a beautiful night to make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side, talkin' 'bout love and life
Oh, how lucky am I when I look in your eyes

What a wonderful way to spend a moment or two
To be lying awake and be here talking to you
I got something to say, I know what I gotta do
To be making a change now, the moment of truth

Why am I feeling so nervous when
Things are going so perfect ten?
But I know that it's worth it to spend forever with you

And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you, "Darling, honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you (Tonight), will you marry me?
Just say 'yes'
One word, one love, one life"

A gentle touch of the hand, fingers running through hair
Lips pressed to her lips, oh, I was caught unaware
Arms holding me tight, tears in both of our eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives

The sun will reappear, burning auburn and red
My chest was the pillow, green grass knoll was the bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth
And what a wonderful way of falling deeper in you

Why was I feeling nervous when
Things were going so perfect ten?
And now I know that it's worth it to spend forever with you

And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you, "Darling, honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you (Tonight), will you marry me?
Just say 'yes'
One word, one love, one life"

(Your hand in mine) Some things were just meant to be
(Hearts intertwined) Some things were just meant to be
(In perfect time) Some things were just meant to be
(Oh, you and I) Some things were just meant to be

(Your hand in mine) Some things were just meant to be
(Hearts intertwined) Some things were just meant to be
(In perfect time) Some things were just meant to be
(Oh, you and I) Some things were just meant to be

// Penguins //

I met her smoking a cigarette in a toilet cubicle
Red dress, tattooed chest, she's beautiful
This ain't the type of place to start a future, but darling I don't care
Broken hearts can find a love to make them whole anywhere

Well, darling, here we go again
We are only man and woman and we all make mistakes
"Don't you know we're only human?" is what I heard you say
When I heard those words, I knew them, oh, I could feel your pain
'Cause I have felt the same, no

Oh, she said, "We are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try"
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh, can you see the love in mine?

She told me about her mom and dad and they sound just like mine
Day by day, exchanging names, and two souls intertwined
And we have both got it wrong from time to time but let that go
We'll lead each other hand-in-hand, as we mend our broken souls

Oh, darling, here we go again
Oh, we are only blood and bones that cover beating hearts
Scarred by sticks and stones, but we know who we are
And I could put you back together when you come apart
And we should make a start now, oh

Well, she said, "We are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try"
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh, can you see the love in mine?
Can you see the love in mine?

And it feels like we've found serenity
And some things are not what they seem, my love
Right now it's only you and me

Oh, she said, "We are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try"
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Well, can you see the love in mine?

Oh, she said, "We are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try"
Oh, I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh, can you see the love in mine?
Oh, can you see the love in mine?
Oh, can you see the love in mine?

// I Will Remember You //

I will remember you in the way you'd want me to
But it's hard to come to terms right now
The sunset looked today as if it knew you'd gone away
Now it's night, I hear the rain crash down

Oh, I'd cry, but this is more than just my pain
Oh, I should be a shoulder, not a burden
And it's time for me to call your son again
And say

She was the starlight in darkness
She was the first bloom in spring
An angel with a smile like electric light
All the time hid her wings
She was the birdsong in morning
But now everything here has changed
Oh, the world's less beautiful since you've been away

I will remember you with white wine by the barbecue
One New York birthday do Downtown
All that comes to mind when I think about that time
Is a memory of laughing out loud

Oh, I wish that I could take the pain away
And just talk to him in person
But it's time for me to call your son again
And say

She was the starlight in darkness
She was the first bloom in spring
An angel with a smile like electric light
All the time hid her wings
She was the birdsong in morning
But now everything here has changed
Oh, the world's less beautiful since you've been away

This doesn't make sense
I wish I could change it, but I can't do anything
My heart is racing
And my soul is aching, lover

Well, she was the starlight in darkness
She was the first bloom in spring
An angel with a smile like electric light
All the time hid her wings
She was the birdsong in morning
But now everything here has changed
Oh, the world's less beautiful since you've been away
The world's less beautiful since you've been away

// Welcome To The World //

Welcome to the world
I heard your heartbeat and lost every word
Just stood there quietly, taking in the sound
Of our love

This is gonna hurt, but I'll stand beside you
For better or for worse
And I will find you whenever you're lost
I'll be right here

And ooh I know that everything's changing
Ooh and I don't wanna miss a thing
Ooh I know that life won't ever be the same
And this love won't ever go away

Welcome to the world
Through all the pain, you're a diamond in the dirt
Don't let them change you, words are only words
Just like "I love you"

And yes you were the first, a new beginning
Bright and unreserved, a beautiful red flower in the earth
Will grow, and I know

Ooh I know that everything's changing
Ooh and I don't wanna miss a thing
Ooh I know that life won't ever be the same
And this love won't ever go away

Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world
Oh, welcome to the world
Hmmm, welcome to the world
Ah ah

Ooh I know that everything's changing
Ooh and I don't wanna miss a thing
Ooh I know that life won't ever be the same
And this love won't ever go away

// The Joker And The Queen (Remix) //

How was I to know?
It's a crazy thing
I showed you my hand
And you still let me win

And who was I to say
That this was meant to be?
The road that was broken
Brought us together

And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen

I've been played before
If you hadn't guessed
So I kept my cards close
To my foolproof vest

But you called my bluff (But you called my bluff)
And saw through all my tells (And saw through all my tells)
And then you went all-in
And we left together

And I know you think that what makes a king
Is gold, a palace and diamond rings
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen

And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I folded, you saw the best in me
The joker and the queen
The joker and the queen

// 2step (Remix) //

I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment

You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

'Cause we're living life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans
And not give a damn
If we're missing out on what the people think is right

Seeing through a picture behind a screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays

And then we'll go all night

Two-stepping with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes
Electrified, we'll keep turning up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up
Alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us

Baby
Sun comin' up when we walk out, we lost the track of time
Everything that I been dealin' with ain't even crossed my mind
I don't see nobody in here but us foreal, for you I'm blind
We go anywhere, it don't take much for us to catch a vibe

Come here, I need to tell you somethin', let me whisper in your ear
Do whatever to get you there, I'll put you on a Lear, yeah
Private island for a month straight, they'll think you disappeared
Lamb truck'll look good on you, I'm coppin' you that Urus

I think I'm 'bout ready to make love in this club
Only thing I need is my drank and my drugs
I done got on ten and forgot where I was
Some parts I don't like, but this part I love

Only me and my guys
I been having me a good time, you can see it all in my eyes
Two-stepping with shawty, got her rockin' side-to-side
You should lemme know when you get ready to ride 'cause

We'll go all night

Two-stepping with the woman I love (I love)
All my troubles turn to nothing when I'm in your eyes
Electrified, we'll keep turning up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up
Alone then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night

Night, night
Two-stepping with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night

// Bad Habits (Remix) //

Woo-ooh, ooh-ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true
It's true my bad habits lead to you

Woah-ooh, ooh-ooh
Woah-ooh, ooh-ooh

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
We started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothing happens after two, it's true
It's true, my bad habits lead to you

Woah-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Woah-ooh, ooh-ooh
Woah-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Woah-ooh, ooh-ooh

We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out
We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to you

Woah-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Woah-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you, you!
Bad habits lead to you!
No, it's true, my bad habits lead to you!

// Boat //

Came in for the embers
Stayed out for the breeze
I need to feel elements to remind me
There's beauty when it's bleak

Stuck out long before lights down
Why do I breathe?

Oh, I know

The more that I love the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal but I know
Maybe I won't

But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't break my boat

Stones crash on the boardwalk
The wind rush through the trees
I keep my eyes peeled
The memories always fall short
Of what we could have been

Left out long before last call
What do I need?

Oh, I know

The more that I love the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal but I know
Maybe I won't

But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't break my boat
The waves won't break my boat

The more that I love the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal but I know
Maybe I won't

And the waves won't break my boat
