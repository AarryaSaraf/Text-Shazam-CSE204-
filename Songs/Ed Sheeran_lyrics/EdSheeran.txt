// Open Your Ears //

Canât get you off my mind
Look at me and you will find
Time after time it seems
Iâll say what I donât mean

In your world we were the same
In mine now youâre the one to blame
You canât remember my name
Weâre lost, itâs such a shame

Listen to me
Stop making me see
What Iâve been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see

Iâm strong yet proud
Iâm quiet yet loud
And Iâm everything
You want in me
Iâm small yet tall
I have it all
And Iâm everything
You want me to be

Listen to me
Stop making me see
What Iâve been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see

And I still feel like
I need you still
And I still feel like
Iâm on some pill
And I still feel like
I need you still

Listen to me
Stop making me see
What Iâve been waiting for
Listen to me
Making me see

// Beyond The Pale //

Just lay it all down on me
Itâs getting harder for me to breathe
Just want to know if it will be
Just want to know if it is me

And you know Iâve learned from my mistakes
And how much have I got to lose?
You find my heart is hard to break
Canât keep playing the fool

Breathe in, exhale
To turn to move beyond the pale
Flag up, set sail
To find whatâs there beyond the pale

I feel like Iâve gone to the end of the world
What do I have to do?

You know Iâve learned from my mistakes
How much have I got to lose?
You find my heart hard to break
Canât keep playing the fool

Breathe in, exhale
To turn to move beyond the pale
Flag up, set sail
To find whatâs there beyond the pale

What can I do
Just to let you know
That youâre in my mind?
To try and justify
The way you liberate me
Every time

// In Memory //

I write this song in memory of
The wayward smile
The boy we won't forget
The soul you took away from us
The river flows
The tears that we wept

Missing you
Is all that needs to be said
More than blue
The words inside my head

And I know that you're gone
And I know that you're gone

The cheeky smile
Of jokes and laughs
The memories of times
We crossed the line
The stepping stones
Across my mind
Washed away
We all now feel so blind

Missing you
Is all that needs to be said
More than blue
The words inside my head

And I know that you're gone
I know that you're gone
I know that you're gone
I know that you're gone

Goodbye

// Insomniac's Lullaby //

Iâm getting very edgy
Cos youâre trying to take this from me
And itâs something that I wanted so bad
Cos youâre the definition
Of someone who has to ruin
The best thing that I ever had
Cos youâre a jealous girl
And all I can say is
Itâs your fault but partially mine
For losing hope
For not treating you right
But that will disappear in time

All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say whatâs wrong
Whenever I say why?

Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
Iâm losing sleep
I live only for the week

Iâve grown to ignore you
Cos when I seem to bore you
You pretend that youâre not interested
Your eyes start to twinkle
Your smile starts to widen
And I just seem to try and forget
But you pay me no attention
Even though I do
But I donât care as long as youâre mine
Itâs happening every time

All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say whatâs wrong
Whenever I say why?

Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
Iâm losing sleep
I live only for the week

And Iâm falling harder now it seems
My slip-ups haunt me in my dreams
And I canât sleep although I think I can
Itâs insomnia I think I have
But who cares when Iâm not your man?

Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
Iâm losing sleep
I live only for the week

// Quiet Ballad Of Ed //

In shadow there lies hope
Cut tension with a knife
I find it hard to cope
Stop playing with my life
You analyze my fears
Analyze my dreams
Choke on burning tears
Through my silent screams

Things aren't what they seem

Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better

Watch me fall
As I stumble at your feet
Always losing in this game
Your lies cut me deep
And you don't even know my name
With your consistency
To always watch me crawl
And my durability
Not affected at all

Still things aren't what they seem

Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better

Feel the pain
On my brain
Feel the strain
As I start to decay
Feel the strain
Every passing day
Feel the pain
As I start to decay

Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better

// No Luck //

Iâm screaming out upon my face
Followed footsteps catch my pace
Broken windows fall in place
Now shattered lovers find their place

Weâd flirt
And youâd treat me like dirt
All the pain and the hurt
Just to make matters worse

And I see you all over him
Irresistible sin
When can we be the same again?
What can I do to be making you see?
To come out clean?
Youâre better off with me

Weâre stuck
Taking time and wasting mine
No luck
Running around and crashing down
In you I trust nevermore
Leaving you in sand and glass

All I ever felt for you
Went up in a cloud of smoke
How I could I be such a fool
To ever think that we were close?

And I see you all over him
Irresistible sin
When can we be the same again?
What can I do to be making you see?
To come out clean?
Youâre better off with me

Weâre stuck
Taking time and wasting mine
No luck
Running around and crashing down
In you I trust nevermore
Leaving you in sand and glass

// Stevensong //

Stevie was a boy
Who turned into a man
He never had no master plan
But I knew that he could
Find right from wrong
Sing me a different song
He told me which road to take
And now Iâm gone

Keep on singing
Make her life whole
Stevie youâre winning
And I just feel cold
Take your life beyond the mark
You can do no wrong
When I lose my way in the dark
Keep singing your song

Please come follow me
I find it hard to breathe
Please come follow me
I find it hard to breathe

// Billy Ruskin //

Mr Ruskin come and paint my picture
Weâre losing sleep 'cos we steal the week
Now whoâs your best friend?
Can you introduce me?
See I canât seem to even let you breathe

When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mindâs eye
Please let me forget that Iâm standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me

Come and show me if you can
See I know youâre me
But I canât seem to understand
If you know me, place my hand on mine
And we will resurrect the time
That we lost when you left my mind
Itâs psycho-paranoia disappearing in time
Come and show me what makes you tick
I need you to get out of my mind quick

When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mindâs eye
Please let me forget that Iâm standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me

// Pause //

You know I got to get away
To find some peace and sanity
Iâve been playing hide-and-seek too long
Shaking, making, everybody waking
Setting the hi-fi bleed
Keeping me back
While youâre spinning my track
Thatâll knock you off your feet

Monkey see what monkey do
But Iâm a monkey telling you
I just think that we should take a break
Tickity-tock the clock
With the hip-hop
And alonestar backing me up
We wonât stop
I gotta be searching for my peace of mind
Now let the track rewind

And play, let the music play
It came, so let the music say what it feels
Shame, shame it took too long
To see that you were wrong
Now turn the song back on

This is Alonestar coming at you
With a new style
Kicking dust
Ready to bust
It's Urban Angel
Artistic, flipping the script
Who d'you really want to get it with?
Ed and Alonestar
We're like live wires sparking
Ready to blow
We've already sown our seeds
We're just waiting to grow - blow
We're gonna lift you like a shock to your body
Metaphorical speech when we come and see
You ducking for cover
Sheeran Lock coming ready to rock
With Urban Angel and Alonestar
And Ed - keep it locked
Let the beat pump
Drop the bass but don't stop
We're kicking the sound
Let the bass bins pound
We're gonna roll
Can you feel me now with my body?
Get down to the sound
It's Ed Sheeran in the place
And Alonestar rising up
We gotta rise up
I said rise up

And play, let the music play
It came, so let the music say what it feels
Shame, shame it took so long
To see that you were wrong
Now turn the song back on

// The Sea //

Pass me a drink
You say itâs gonna take a while
Your consciousness sinks
Tears from a crocodile

Youâre wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, donât reach
Your smile

Youâre holding your tears
Your inside is dead
Youâre eating your fears
In a cigarette

Youâve waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea

Iâve taken the blow
Itâs all down on paper
Had fun in the snow
But no âsee you laterâ

Youâre wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, donât reach
Your smile

Youâre holding your tears
Your inside is dead
Youâre eating your fears
In a cigarette

Youâve waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea

// Way Home //

Well I once heard a story about a run-down home
Where a man and his thoughts lived all alone
He tried to live, no effort was shown
Heâs slowly finding a way back home

He had a family with smiles and frowns
They never could solve his way to be down
Cos heâs one dog who donât want a bone
Heâs slowly finding a way back home

He had a nice house with windows and doors
He said to his wife whatâs mine is yours
But the seeds of deception are soon to be sown
Heâs slowly finding a way back home

His children have left but the rooms are still there
His misses the noise and the scents in their hair
But far from the nest the babies have flown
Heâs slowly finding a way back home

His wife was an angel sent from above
He never returned her kisses or love
But soon heâd found that sheâd overgrown
This man whoâs finding a way back home

So the leaves are all dead in this broken manâs June
The rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon
He stares at the floor, no more to roam
Heâs slowly finding a way back home

Well I once heard a story about a run-down home
Where a man with regrets lived all alone
He tried to live, no effort was shown
Heâll never find a way back home

// Bonus Track //

I want to be real
Not some conscience to myself
The way you worship, never ending
Some idol whoâs pretending to be true
How you put upon yourself
A man who never seems
To answer to you words
So go and make me over

Iâm a fly upon your neck
You canât control me
I have my words, my voice
My strengths, my choice
And I can cut as deep
Just as deep as I need

Donât want your advice
Cos Iâve made up my own mind
The way you bore me with the stories
Of far and distant times
Iâve heard it before
So donât try that on me
The way you worship, never-ending
Some idol whoâs pretending to be true
It could be you
Brainwashed by the lies
Itâs no surprise
That youâd wanna waste your time

Iâm a fly upon your neck
You canât control me
I have my words, my voice
My strengths, my choice
And I can cut as deep
Just as deep as I need
