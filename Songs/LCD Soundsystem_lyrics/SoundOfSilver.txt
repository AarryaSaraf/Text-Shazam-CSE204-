// Get Innocuous! //

Home - home in the late-night
And away - away in the half-life
Except saturday - crushed by the boring
Until played and plagued by the tourists again

When once you had believed it
Now you see it's sucking you in

To string you along with the pretense
And pave the way for the coming release

Alone and prone in the half-light
And late- late to the real-life
If you will find a way into the gold rush
You will stay until the morning comes
You can normalize
Don't it make you feel alive

// Time To Get Away //

Its time to get away, its time to get away from you
Its time to get away, its time to get away from you
You brought a lot of money
But me, I got a tiny tummy
And you, you make me sleep
I try and try
But you're under my knee
And I start to be sensible (if you know what I mean)
And so its time to get away, Its time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away, I'm dying to get away
Next time we'll talk it over
And we can start again
For you, I caught a lot of static
And me, I would like it automatic
Ah-what what what what what did you think would happen next?
Ah-what what what what what could it ever be?
Though its time to get away, its time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away, I'm dying to get away
Next time let's talk about it
And maybe start again
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to pity you, it's true
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to talk to you, it's true
Next time we can talk about it
Or even start again
I couldn't tell you what you wanted
(You know what I'm saying?) I knew you were low man,
But the truth is I was shocked
(Of) power eyes, eyes never lie
Kids, Kids never lie.

// North American Scum //

Oh oh oh
Oh I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
We are north americans
And for those of you who still think we're from england
We're not, no.
We build our planes and our trains till we think we might die,
Far from North America,
Where the buildings are old and you might have lots of mimes.
Aha, oh, oh.
I hate the feelin' when you're looking at me that way
Cause we're north americans
But if we act all shy, it'll make it ok
Makes it go away.

Oh I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
When we're north american
But in the end we make the same mistakes all over again
Come on north americans

We are north american scum
We're from north america

And all the kids all the kids that want to make the scene
Here in north america
When our young kids get to read it in your magazines
We don't have those
So where's the love where's the love where's the love where's the love where's the love tonight?
But there's no love man there's no love and the kids are uptight
So throw a party till the cops come in and bust it up
Let's go north americans
Oh you were planning it I didn't mean to interrupt
Sorry
I did it once and my parents got pretty upset
Freaked out in north america
But then I said the more I do it the better it gets

Let's rock north america

We are north american scum
We're from north america
We are north american scum
We are north american

New york's the greatest if you get someone to pay the rent
Wahoo north america
And it's the furthest you can live from the government un huh huh
Some proud american christians might disagree
Here in north america
But new york's the only place we're keepin them off the street
Boo boo now we can't have parties like in spain where they go all night
Shut down in north america
Or like berlin where they go another night, alright, un huh un huh

You see I love this place that I have grown to know
Alright, north america.
And yeah, I know you wouldn't touch us with a ten-foot pole
'cause we're north americans.

We are north american scum
We are north americans
We are north american scum
We love north america

Take me back to the states man
North american scum
Where we can be all we want if we really ??
North american
Where the dj gigs are as fun
Here in north american scum
Don't blame the canadians
Let go north america

// Someone Great //

I wish that we could talk about it,
But there, that's the problem.
With someone new I couldn't start it,
Too late, for beginnings.
The little things that made me nervous,
Are gone, in a moment.
I miss the way we used to argue,
Locked, in your basement.

I wake up and the phone is ringing,
Surprised, as it's early.
And that should be the perfect warning,
That something's, a problem.
To tell the truth I saw it coming,
The way, you were breathing.
But nothing can prepare you for it,
The voice, on the other, end.

The worst is all the lovely weather,
I'm stunned, it's not raining.
The coffee isn't even bitter,
Because, what's the difference?
There's all the work that needs to be done,
It's late, for revision.
There's all the time and all the planning,
And songs, to be finished.

And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming,
And it keeps coming, 
Till the day it stops
[x3]
And it keeps coming,
[x7]
Till the day it stops.

I wish that we could talk about it,
But there, that's the problem.
With someone new I could have started,
Too late, for beginnings.
You're smaller than my wife imagined,
Surprised, you were human.
There shouldn't be this ring of silence,
But what, are the options?

When someone great is gone.
[x8]

We're safe, for the moment.
Saved, 
For the moment.

// All My Friends //

That's how it starts
We go back to your house
We check the charts
And start to figure it out

And if it's crowded, all the better
Because we know we're gonna be up late
But if you're worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay
That's how it starts

And so it starts
You switch the engine on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways we show our age

And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
And I still don't wanna stagger home
Then it's the memory of our betters
That are keeping us on our feet

You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again

You're talking 45 turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend

It comes apart
The way it does in bad films
Except in parts
When the moral kicks in

Though when we're running out of the drugs
And the conversation's winding away
I wouldn't trade one stupid decision
For another five years of life

You drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
And the next ten people who are trying to be polite
When you're blowing eighty-five days in the middle of France
Yeah, I know it gets tired only where are your friends tonight?

And to tell the truth
Oh, this could be the last time
So here we go
Like a sales force into the night

And if I made a fool, if I made a fool, if I made a fool
On the road, there's always this
And if I'm sued into submission
I can still come home to this

And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand
You can sleep on the plane or review what you said
When you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tan
You think over and over, "hey, I'm finally dead."

Oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand
You can turn it on yourself you ridiculous clown
You forgot what you meant when you read what you said
And you always knew you were tired, but then
Where are your friends tonight?

Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?

If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight

// Watch The Tapes //

Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
I get all confused when you mix up the dates....
Woah!

Don't gimme the pretend you come for the weekend
And you stay for the week
You say that you hate it but that's how you made it
Just keep it oblique
We're both high high high, high high on lemon sips
We're all suh-suh-suh sucked-in-by parlour tricks

Oh the people deceive you the kids never leave
Cuz you make them at home
You try to appease them and they show you the stick
But still you pick up the phone
But hey man, you can take it
As long as they don't shove you out in the cold
It's not getting better, no it's not getting better, man
It's just getting old
Ah ooh! we do what we're programmed to do--
Hey we do what we're told

I never remember to carry my book when I get on the bus
You never forget it's your time to collect
When they are making a fuss
We're both high high high, high high on lemon sips
We're all high high high, high high on wiggling hips
Ah ooh! you break off your plans for the weekend
And ah oh! you can tell them the dates
But that don't mean they're letting you go

Don't gimme the pretend you come for the weekend
And you stay for the year
Avoid all the plans cuz we're making our day jobs
Into a steady career
We're both high high high, high high on lemon sips
We all claw claw claw, cli-climb-on to sinking ships
And ah ooh! avoid all the cold sideways glances
And ah ooh! celebrate! celebrate! celebrate!
And then turn to stone

Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
You turn 25 and now you're all out of escapes
C'mon

Hey the rock writer told me to tell you:
"though you're great and you're brave
You still lack that which makes you a star."
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
We all get a little drunk and then we act like apes
Ow!

// Sound Of Silver //

Sound of silver talk to me
Makes you want to feel like a teenager
Until you remember the feelings of
A real life emotional teenager
Then you think again

// New York, I Love You But You're Bringing Me Down //

New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down

New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down

Like a rat in a cage
Pulling minimum wage

New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down

New York, you're safer
And you're wasting my time

Our records all show
You are filthy but fine

But they shuttered your stores
When you opened the doors
To the cops who were bored
Once they'd run out of crime

New York, you're perfect
Don't please don't change a thing

Your mild billionaire mayor's
Now convinced he's a king

So the boring collect
I mean all disrespect

In the neighborhood bars
I'd once dreamed I would drink

New York, I Love You
But you're freaking me out

There's a ton of the twist
But we're fresh out of shout

Like a death in the hall
That you hear through your wall

New York, I Love You
But you're freaking me out

New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down

New York, I Love You
But you're bringing me down

Like a death of the heart
Jesus, where do I start?

But you're still the one pool
Where I'd happily drown

And oh.. Take me off your mailing list
For kids who think it still exists
Yes, for those who think it still exists

Maybe I'm wrong
And maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong
And maybe you're right

Maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong
And just maybe you're right

And oh..
Maybe mother told you true
And there'll always be somebody there for you
And you'll never be alone

But maybe she's wrong
And maybe I'm right
And just maybe she's wrong

Maybe she's wrong
And maybe I'm right
And if so, is there?
