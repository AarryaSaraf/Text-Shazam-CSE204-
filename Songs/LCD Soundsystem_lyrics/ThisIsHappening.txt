// Dance Yrself Clean //

Walking up to me expecting walking up to me
Expecting words it happens all the time
Present company excepted present company
Except the worst it happens every night

Ah aaaaah present company
Excluded every time
Ah aaaaaah present company
The best that you can find

Talking like a jerk
Except you are an actual jerk
And living proof that sometimes friends are mean

Present company expect it present company
Just laugh it off it's better than it seems

Ah aaaaaah present company
Excluded in every way
Ah aaaaaah present company
Makes me wanna stay

Killing it with close inspection
Killing it can only make it worse
It sort of makes it breed
Present company accepting
Presently we all expect the worst
Works just like a need

Ah aaaaah present company
Excluded in the night
Ah aaaaah present company
Included in the fight

Ah aaaaaaaah, ah aaaaaaaah, aaaaaah
Ah aaaaaaah

Don't you want me to wake up?
Then give me just a bit of your time
Arguments are made for make-ups
So give it just a little more time

We've got to bring our resources
I wanna play it 'til the time comes
Forget your string of divorces
Just go and throw your little hands up

I miss the way the night comes
With friends who always make it feel good
This basement has a cold glow
Though it's better than a bunch of others

So go and dance yourself clean... ooow
Go and dance yourself clean yeah
You're blowing Marxism to pieces
Their little arguments to pieces

It's your show [x4]

Put your little feet doooooooooooown and haaaaaaaang out

Every night's a different story
It's a thirty car pile-up with you
Everybody's getting younger
It's the end of an era, it's true

And you go
(Stop, stop, stop, stop)

Break me into bigger pieces
So some of me is home with you
Wait until the weekend
And we can make our bad dreams come true

And it's ago yeah, it's ago
And if we wait until the weekend
We can miss the best things to do, oh

Go and dance yourself clean
Go and dance yourself clean
You're throwing marks into pieces
Maybe they're arguments the pieces

Oh

We should try a little harder
In the tedious march of the few
Every day's a different warning
There's a part of me hoping it's true

// Drunk Girls //

Drunk girls [x4]

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls cause a couple of heart attacks
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls are unusually mild
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys keep in pace with the pedophiles
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls are boringly wild

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls get invitations from nations
(Drunk girls)
They got the patience of a million saints
(Drunk boys)
They steal, they steal from the cupboards
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls like to file complaints

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls are like a night of simplicity
(Drunk girls)
They need a lover who is smarter than me
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys, we walk like pedestrians
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls wait an hour to pee

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls know that love is an astronaut
(Drunk girls)
It comes back, but it's never the same
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys, drunk boys, drunk boys, drunk boys
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls can be just as insane

Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
So oh oh
That means making eyes across the room

(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause I'm shallow doesn't mean that I'm heartless
(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause I'm heartless doesn't mean that I'm mean
(Drunk boys)
Sometimes love gives us too many options
(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause you're hungry doesn't mean that you're lean

(Drunk girls)
I've heard lies that could curdle your heartstrings
(Drunk girls)
A couple truths, maybe burn out your eyes
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys leave their irons in the fireplace
(Drunk girls)
'Cause drunk girls give them too many tries

Drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls...

Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
Oh oh oh
I believe I'm waking up, but no promises
Oh oh oh
I believe in waiting out the weather
Oh oh oh
I believe in making up

The day becomes the night [x4]
Honestly, honestly, honestly
Unless it hurts, why do it?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Oh

// One Touch //

I don't think that we will be pleased with this
We have waited for a long time
I recall the promises made to us
We've been patient for a long time

One touch is never enough
You gave the opening, opening
One touch is never enough
People who need people, to the back of the bus

I don't see how we could be pleased with this
We've been waiting for a long time
I recall the promises made to us
We've been patient such a long time

No one is dangerous
We are not dangerous
Unless we get a closer view

One touch is never enough
People need to move to the back of the bus
One touch is never enough
Complicated people never do what you're told to

One touch is never enough
People will need this in the back of the bus
One touch is never enough
People who need people are just people who need people

One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
People who need people are just people who need people

I don't think that we will be pleased with this
We have waited such a long time
There's no way that we can be pleased with this
We've been waiting such a long time

We've been waiting such a long time
We've been waiting such a long time
This is getting sort of unreasonable
But we've been waiting a very long time

One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough

One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
One touch is never enough
People who need people, to the back of the bus

No one is dangerous
No one is dangerous
Until we get a closer view

// All I Want //

Wait for the day you come home from the lonely part
And look for the girl who has put up with all of your shit
You never have needed anyone for so long

You learn in your bed you've been gone for too long
To put in the time, but it's too late to make it strong

Now all I want is your pity
Or all I want is your bitter tears
Yeah, all I want is your pity
Or at least all I want are your bitter tears

All I want is your pity
Or all I want are your bitter tears
Yeah, all I want is your pity
Or all I want are your bitter tears

Wake with a start
And the dog and the girl are gone
So you pack up your things
And head into the lame unknown
You never had needed anything for so long

And now all I want is your pity
And all I want are your bitter tears
Now all I want is your pity
And all I want are your bitter tears

From now on, I'm someone different
Cuz it's no fun to be predictably lame
From now on, let's do it different
Cuz I just want what I want

Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home

// I Can Change //

Tell me a line make it easy for me
Open your arms
Dance with me until I feel all right
It's good in the dark, good in the dark
But into the lover's light
Here comes another fight

So ring the alarm, ring the alarm
Bar me and hold me and cling to my arm
Here it comes, here it comes

And what you're asking me now, disastrous now
Hoping and hoping and hoping
The feeling goes away

Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
This is why I fell in love oooh

Never change, never change, never change, never change
Never change, never change, never change
That's just too up there in love with
(in love...)

This is the time the very best time
So give me a line and take me home
Take me over

But dashing the hopes dashing the hopes
And smashing the pride
The morning's got you on the ropes .. ooh

And love is a murderer, love is a murderer
But if she calls you tonight
Everything is all right
Yeah, we know
And love is a curse shoved in a hearse
Love is an open book to a verse of your bad poetry
And this is coming from me

But I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(fall in love)
[repeat]

Turn on the light make it easy for me
Fill the divide fumble in the kitchen
Til it's right
What an awful sight

But there's love in your eyes
Love in your eyes, love in your eyes
But maybe that's just what your lover finds
All night!

And I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
I can change, I can change, I can change
If it helps you fall in love
(fall in love)
[repeat]

// You Wanted A Hit //

You wanted a hit
But maybe we don't do hits
I try and try
It ends up feeling kind of wrong

You wanted it tough
But is it ever tough enough?
No, nothing's ever tough enough
Until we hit the road

Yeah, you wanted it lush
But honestly you must hush
No honestly you know too much
So leave us, leave us on our own

And so you wanted a hit
Well, this is how we do hits
You wanted the hit
But that's not what we do

You wanted it real
But can you tell me what's real?
There's lights and sounds and stories
Music's just a part

Yeah, you wanted the truth
And then you said you want proof
I guess you're used to liars
Saying what they want

And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies
'Til you take us home

No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies
'Til you take us home

Yeah, you wanted it smart
But honestly I'm not smart
No, honestly we're never smart
We fake it, fake it all the time

Yeah, you wanted the time
But maybe I can't do time
Oh, we both know that's an awful line
But it doesn't make it wrong

You wanted it right
No out of mind and out of sight
No dirty bus and early flight
No seven days and forty nights

Yeah, you wanted a hit
But tell me where's the point in it?
You wanted the hit
But that's not what we do

And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies
'Til you take us home

No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies 
'Til you take us home

And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies
'Til you take us home

No, we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We can't be your babies 
'Til you take us home

// Pow Pow //

From this position
I will relax
From this position
I can see the whole place

From this position
Oh, just relax
From this position
I make some stand
I make my peace with the man

And it goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
It goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

From this position
I can see both of them
From this position
I totally get how the decision was reached

From this position
I can say "serious" or "cop-out" or "hard to define"
From this position, from this position
It's kind of like eating myself to death

You on the outside
Me on the inside
There's advantage to both

And me being uptight
And you being all right
There's advantages to each

From this perspective, from this position
I have a good grip on both of them
Because I have stayed home and have learned a little more about my neighbourhood, which is important
You know, there's a lot of good places to eat

So it goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

So it's pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
It goes pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

With you on the keystroke
And me in the gang blank
There's advantages to both

And you have been all right
And I have been filmed being ridiculous
Oh, eat it, Michael Musto
You're no Bruce Valance

I have been untied
And you are all cross-eyed
There's advantages to each

And I'm coming back, coming back, coming back
Until there's nothing left in the well
Is that what they call it, the well?

I'm paralyzed and looking through you
But if nothing's right, we try anyway

As we compromised an arrogant person
I'm amazed at my decision to blame

On this occasion, there are a couple of things that we know that we learned from fact magazine
One, the king wears a king hat and lives in a king house
Two, your time will come, but tonight is our night, so you should give us all of your drugs
Three, we have a black president and you do not, so shut up,
because you don't know shit about where I'm from that you didn't get from your TV

So times have been tough, and times have been tough
You have been put down, washed up, erased out
But honestly, and be honest with yourself, how much time do you waste?
How much time do you blow every day?

So pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Oh, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

So pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow

The return of the police

With you on the inside
Me on the outside
There's advantages to both

With me being wired
And you being tired
There's advantages to each

From this position, I feel affinity for the both of them, which is confusing
But honestly, I should be careful because otherwise, I'm being, I'm being, you know, what's it called?
Oh, fuck it

Reclining, I'm getting used to it
Like kissing under a bridge
It's an entirely new discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery

A couple of weeks at home
And then a couple of weeks away
And then home and away, again
To use up your desire for discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery

For an instant, you could have pushed through
But it's a plagiarized regret anyway
But what you want for now is someone to feel you
And that's the thing you like, is planning to stay

The return of the police!

// Somebody's Calling Me //

Somebody's calling me to be my girl
Somebody's calling me to be my girl
But my hands don't work; they're more like feet
And the wake-up call, "go back to sleep"

Babe, come with me
And I'll take you to the place I sleep
Oh, darling, come with me
And I'll show you the place I sleep

Somebody's phoning me to be my girl
Somebody's phoning me to be my girl
But the phone won't ring when I'm on the street
And the heart won't beat when I'm half asleep

Somebody's texting me to be my girl
Constantly texting me to be my girl
But the text won't take away nights that creep
And my mouth won't move when I'm in too deep

Babe, come with me
And I'll take you to the place I sleep
Oh, darling, come with me
And I'll show you the place I sleep

All right

Somebody's calling me into their work
Wrapped up and full of good inside their work
But the car won't start when I'm half asleep
And the kids don't cry when you're on your feet

Babe, come with me
And I'll show you the place I sleep
Oh, darling, come with me
And I'll take you to the place I live
The place I live
The place I live
The place I live
The places where I live

// Home //

Home
Home
Home
Home
Home
Home
Take me home

Just do it right
Make it perfect and real
Because it's everything
No everything was never the deal

So grab your things and stumble into the night
So we can shut the door
Oh, shut the door on terrible times

Yeah, do it right
And head again into space
So you can carry on
And carry on, and fall all over the place

This is the trick, forget a terrible year
That we can break the laws
Until it gets weird

And this is what you waited for
But under lights, we're all unsure
So tell me
What would make you feel better?

As night has such a local ring
And love and rock are pick-up things
And you know it
Yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know

Take

Forget your past
This is your last chance now
And we can break the rules
Like nothing will last

You might forget
Forget the sound of a voice
Still you should not forget
Yeah, don't forget
The things that we laughed about

And after rolling on the floor
And thankfully, a few make sure that you get home
And you stay home
And you better

'Cause you're afraid of what you need
Yeah, you're afraid of what you need
If you weren't, yeah you weren't
Then I don't know what we'd talk about

Yeah no one ever knows what you're talking about
So i guess you're already there
No one opens up when you scream and shout
But it's time to make a couple things clear

If you're afraid of what you need
If you're afraid of what you need
Look around you, you're surrounded
It won't get any better

Until the night

// Oh You (Christmas Blues) //

Oh you
How can I regret?
How can I regret what you do?
You know the blame is on you

You won't leave me alone
Though it's the right thing
How can I forget what you put me through?
Sometimes I can't believe it's true

And now we're through
But you think we're cool
And this is my big difference with you

I think I'm ashamed
The way I feel
I know I'm ashamed
I feel like a shock

I want to forget
I want to forget
I get what I get
These Christmas blues
And that's the truth
But they come in, they come in
