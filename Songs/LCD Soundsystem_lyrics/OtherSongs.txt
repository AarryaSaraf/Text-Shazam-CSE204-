// (We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang //

(Everybody move to prove the groove)

(Everybody move to prove the groove)
(Everybody move to prove the groove)
(Everybody move to prove the groove)
(Everybody move to prove the groove)
(Everybody move to prove the groove)

Have you heard it on the news
About this fascist groove thang?
Evil men with racist views
Spreadin' all across the land
Don't just sit there on your ass
Unlock that funky chaindance
Brothers, sisters, shoot your best
We don't need this fascist groove thang

Brothers, sisters
We don't need this fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need this fascist groove thang

History will repeat itself
Crisis point, we're near the hour
Counterforce will do no good
Hot U.S. I feel your power
Hitler proves that funky stuff
It's not for you and me, girl (no, no no)
Europe's an unhappy land
They've had their fascist groove thang

Brothers, sisters
We don't need this fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need this fascist groove thang

Democrats are out of power
Across that great wide ocean
The orange one is President
Fascist God in motion
Generals tell him what to do
Stop your good time dancing
Train their guns on me and you
Fascist thang advancing

Sisters, brothers lend a hand
Increase our population
Grab that groove thang by the throat
And throw it in the ocean
You're real tonight, you move my soul
Let's cruise out on the dance floor
Come out your house and dance your dance
Shake that fascist groove thang (shake it)

Brothers, sisters
We don't need this fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need this fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need this fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need this fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need this fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need this fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need this fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need this fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need this fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need this fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need this fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need this fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need this fascist groove thang

// Big Ideas //

I don't hold you responsible,
all the time i'm alone,
i don't think, its unreasonable,
so i'll cling all night long

The way you make me feel, you got me so tied up [x4]

Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

Here comes the big ideas again, just like they did before and then,
the morning comes again and its on and on and on and on and ooh [x4]

// Bye Bye Bayou //

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Here I am
I'm your Brooklyn baby
With a premonition
Walking Cajun queen unknowing
Walking Cajun queen unknowing
Evil comes ah-flying
Flying so, so low
Sky is turning poison
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Helicopters are coming
Helicopters are coming
To take me far away
Two-fingered Gypsy king
Has a golden, wounded knee
Walking Cajun queen unknowing
Walking Cajun queen unknowing
Going to be a hero
I have my body in a sack with me
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Delta blues
Bye bye Delta blues
Oh, lucky baby
Oh, lucky baby
Providence is coming
Ace of spades by his side
Ooh, ace of spades by his side
Here I am

Here I am
Helicopters flying
A long way down south
To a secret mission town
In the U.S.A
In the U.S.A
Walking Cajun queen unknowing
About the blue light squadron
About the blue light squadron
Here as a witness
I never had a chance
Cartoon creeps are playing
Playing dirty games
Sending me to home
In a one way ticket bodysack
Just like Jimmy always said
An unknown hero
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Bayou
Bye bye Delta blues
Bye bye Delta blues
Bye bye Gypsy baby
Bye bye Gypsy baby
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake

// Christmas Will Break Your Heart //

Christmas will break your heart
If your world is feeling small
There's no one on the phone
You feel close enough to call
Christmas will crush your soul
Like that laid back rock 'n' roll
But your body's getting old
It's much too tired to be so bold
Christmas can wreck your head
Like some listless awkward sex
So you refuse to leave your bed
Get depressed when no one checks
Christmas will break your heart
Like the armies of the unrelenting dark
Once the peace talks fall apart

But still I'm coming home to you

Christmas will shove you down
So just lay back in the snow
That quiet wind won't wake
What inside you has grown cold
Christmas will drown your love
Like a storm down from above
On your fading memories of a normal life
Oh while I thought to make you mine
Believing in the line
That your heart would melt with time
And though you're out with them again
Your thick and fickle friends
They might replace the love that ends

But still I'm coming home to you
To you
To you
To you
Yes you
To you
To you
To you

What if you're done?
What if you don't want it anymore?
So what if they're gone?
So what if they don't love you anymore?

I'm coming home
Can you see me?
Can you still see me?
Hey mama, take my hand!

// Home / I Want Your Love //

["Home"]

Home
Home
Home
Home
Home
Home
Take me home

Just do it right
Make it perfect and real
Because it's everything
No everything was never the deal

So grab your things and stumble into the night
So we can shut the door on terrible times
No

Yeah, do it right
And head again into space
So you can carry on
And carry on, and fall all over the place

This is the trick, forget a terrible year
And we can shut the door until it gets weird

And this is what you waited for
But under lights, we're all unsure
So tell me
What would make you feel better?

As night has such a local ring
And love and rock are fickle things
And you know it
Yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know

Take

Forget your past
This is your last chance now
And we can break the rules
Like fuck all will last

You might forget
Forget the sound of a voice
Though you should not forget
Yeah, don't forget
All the shit that we laughed about

And after rolling on the floor
And thankfully, a few make sure that you get home
And you stay home
'Cause you better

'Cause you're afraid of what you need
Yeah, you're afraid of what you need
If you weren't
I don't know what we'd talk about

Yeah, no one ever knows what you're talking about
So I guess you're already there
And no one opens up when you scream and shout
So it's time to make a couple things clear

If you're afraid of what you need
If you're afraid of what you need
Look around you, you're surrounded
It won't get any better

And so say goodnight

["I Want Your Love"]

What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?

What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
I can't kick this feeling when it hits

Do you feel like you ever want
To try my love and see how well it fits?
Baby, can't you see what you do to me?
I can't kick this feeling when it hits
All alone in my bed at night
I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight
I think of you and I dream of you
All of the time, what am I gonna do?

I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I need your love
I'll share my dreams and make you see
How really bad your love I need
I want your love, I need your love
Just like the birds need sky above
I'll share my dreams and make you see
How really bad your love I need

// i want your love (electric lady sessions) //

How really bad your love I need

// Live Alone //

I wanna live alone
Because the greatest love is always ruined by the bickering
The argument of living
I wanna live alone
I could be happy on my own
Spend test of my life
With the vaguest of feeling
I...

Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You'll know that I'll be here
I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You'll know that I'll be here
I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

So I'm gonna live alone
I'm not saying that our love is the greatest
But I'm in love with you
Wanna stay in love with you

So I'm gonna live alone
Yeah, I'll be happy on my own
For the rest of a life
With the vaguest of feeling
I...

Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You'll know that I'll be here
I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

In New York City
When I get in the taxi
I said, "man" to driver
He said, "man,"
"Oh, I can imagine having drink with that guy"

He's alright
Oh, he's alright
He's alright
Yeah, he's alright
He's alright

Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here
I'll be here
Wishing I could be there
Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here
Wishing I could be there

I want to live alone
So I'll never be alone
[repeated]

// new body rhumba //

Climbing
The down escalator
To the frigid bardo (up! up! up! up!)
Rise (up! up! up! up!)
Kidnap yourself (up!)
Don't call the fuzz
Just gather the bills
You got fives, tens, twenties, fifties
Hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds

Yeah I need a new body
I need a new body
I need a bit of shape and a tone

Yeah I need a new body
I need a nobody
I can't shake sleeping alone

You see I have been misplaced
I have been mislaid
Like a covetous dog that you can't just leave in the home

Yeah I need a new lover
I need a new buddy
I can't stay out too long
(Yeah the hands have gone numb)

Just give us what we want (pana! sonic!)

I never deny it
No point in denying
The ransom and the defense
Has drained us with their expense
It's endless

Yeah I try not to hide it
I try not to buy it
But you can't just sit on the fence
It's true

And no I have been mispriced
I have been mispriced
Chipped and then deviced
Tagged and rinsed for lice

There's nevera warning
I needed a warning
I try to be content
But I'm tight in the chest

So give us what we want (necco mini nilla wafer pana sonic pana sonic)
Please give us what we want (super! super! super! super!)

Over 200 miles of turnpike
3000 milesof goods!
Would you like to add a protein?
Would you like to ask me about my day rates?

I need a new body
I need a new party
To represents my needs

Yeah my distance is growing
But so is the longing
Which leaves the in between

So this is the end
Or near to the end
Let's say goodbye to our beautiful friend
Staggered and blind on the rackâon the mend
Let's close the eyes of our beautiful friend

So I need a new love and
I need a new body
To push away the end
To the water we send you

Dim that light in your eyes
Coming out of your eyes
People can see it
When it pierces the veil
The pink ones at night
When it gets too much
Otherwise too much noise

If you look up
Block out the periphery
The earth and trees surround you
Framing your escape
Into the sky
Into the stars
Leaving the ground
You feel your feet let go

The air a bit cooler now
Thinner in the lungs
Cleaner in the mouth
And you know what they all say
"Don't look down"
"Don't look down"
But they also always say
Selfish, by the bed:
"Don't go to the light"
"Don't go to the light"
"Don't go to the light"
"Don't go to the light"
Well, go into the light
Go into the light
Go into the light
Go into the light...

// seconds (electric lady sessions) //

All day
Hiding from the sun
Waiting for the golden one
Waiting for your fame
After the parade has gone

Outside was a happy place
Every face had a smile like the golden face
For a second
Your knuckles white as your fingers curl
The shot that was heard around the world
For a second

It took seconds of your time to take his life
It took seconds

It took seconds of your time to take his life
It took seconds

It took seconds of your time to take his life
It took seconds of your time to take his life
Seconds
Seconds

It took seconds of your time to take his life
It took seconds
It took seconds of your time to take his life
It took seconds

For a second

It took seconds of your time to take his life
It took seconds
It took seconds of your time to take his life
It took seconds

For a second

It took seconds of your time to take his life
Seconds of your time to take his life
For a second
For a second
For a second
