// Daft Punk Is Playing At My House //

Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
I'll show you the ropes, kid, show you the ropes
Got a bus and a trailer at my house, my house
I'll show you the ropes kid, show you the ropes
I bought fifteen cases for my house, my house
All the furniture is in the garage
Well daft punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah [x2]
You got the set them up, set them up

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah [x2]
You got the set them up, set them up

Well Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
I waited for 7 years and 15 days
There's every kid for miles at my house, my house
And the neighbors can't...call the police 
There's a fist fight brewin' at my house, my house 
Because the jocks can't...get in the door 
When Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah [x2]
You got the set them up, set them up

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah [x2]
You got the set them up, set them up

[Cow bell solo]

Well everybody's lined up in my house, my house
And Sarah's girlfriend is working the door
Got everybody's PA in my house, my house
All the robots descend from the bus
There's a freak out brewing in my house, my house
In the basement
'Cause Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah [x2]
You got the set them up, set them up

You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah [x2]
You got the set them up, set them up

And never, never let them go
No never, never, never let them go
Never, never, never let them go
Let them go
Downtown

// Too Much Love //

What will you say when the day comes
When it's no fun
When it's all done
When it's no fun

What will you say when the time comes
There's a dry run when it's undone
And there's no one

When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
It's too much love
Too much love
Too much

What will you do when you wake up
Fatten you up
Fasten you up
Fatten you up

No memories to get cloudy
To get cloudy when you can't see
What you can't see

It's all the same when it's morning
And you're boring
Still ignoring everything

No memories to remind you
Of the old you
Nothing for it
Just keep it up, keep it up

When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much

What will you say when the day comes
When it's no fun
When it's all done
When it's undone

What will you say when the time comes
There's a dry run when it's undone
And it's undone

When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
It's too much love
Too much love
Too much

What will you do when you wake up
Fatten you up
Fasten you up
Fatten you up

No memories to get cloudy
To get cloudy when you can't see
What you can't see

It's all the same when it's morning
And you're boring

No memories to remind you
Of the old you
Nothing for it
Just keep it up, keep it up

When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much

With no memory
With no memory
With no memory
To keep you up at night

// Tribulations //

Everybody makes mistakes,
But I feel alright when I come undone
You're not not making me wait, 
But it seems alright as long as something's happening

I try to make you late,
But you fight me out like a fire does
You try making me wait, 
But it feels alright as long as something's happening. 

Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations

You try to make me wait
You come around when it's come undone
Everybody makes you late, 
And it's never you, because you're always thinkin'
I try making you wait, 
And you give me some like you give it good
Everybody makes mistakes, 
But it seems it's mine that always keep on stingin'

Get your payments from the nation
For your trial and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation 
For your trial and tribulations

You try making me wait, 
But you come undone when you come undone
Everybody makes mistakes, 
But it's always mine that seem to keep on stickin'

Get your payments from the nation, for your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation, for your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation, for your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation, for your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation, for your trials and tribulations

// Movement //

It's like a movement from the small place
To a bigger city
Or it's a bigger bag to strap the ego of a little baby
It's like a discipline without the discipline of
All of the discipline
It's like a culture
Without the effort of all the culture

Oh but I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
You're yesterday
And I'm tapped
Another reason I'm tapped

It's like a movement
Without the bother of all of the meaning
It's like a discipline
Without the discipline of all of the discipline
It's like a fat guy in a t-shirt
Doing all the saying
It's like a couple dads and a few friends
Trying hard to stay in

You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy and I'm tapped
You're pillaging
And I'm tapped
For best results well I'm tapped

Here comes the report nothing to report see
It's all the same
It seems the punk rock as an experiment well
It pulled up lame
You got the fat guy in the t-shirt
Doing all the singing
Straight to the drunk tank doing the research
Doing all the blame

You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast asleep and I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
For best results well I'm tapped

It's like the culture
Without the effort or all of the luggage
It's like a discipline
Without the discipline of all of the discipline
It's like a movement
Without the bother of the meaning
It's like a culture
Without the culture of all of the culture

You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy
And I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
And you're finicky so I'm tapped

// Never As Tired As When I'm Waking Up //

Wasted and complacent
And you about the same
But still I want to get it
On with you tonight
When I was a little boy
I laid down in the grass
I'm sure you'd feel the same if I
Could fuck you here tonight

But I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
But it feels like I'm in love again
No it feels like I'm in love again
Though it feels like I'm in love again
With what you do

If we made it happen
I'm sure what we would do
Run outside and fuck someone
To show it didn't mean a thing
Seems it could be simple
If I could just grow up
Never gonna get it now
Cause I'll never grow

But I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
But it feels like I'm in love again
No it feels like I'm in love again
Though it feels like I'm in love again
With what you do

But not with you
(Keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Just keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Just keep on telling myself it's true)
But not with you
(Just keep on telling myself it's true)

// On Repeat //

Beats on repeat, beating on me
From every car in the street
There's a constant repeat, on repeat
Of your paranoid, heartbreaking beats
On repeat

It's a five song repeat, beating on me
With your favourite band, that helps you sleep
And here comes the new stylish creep
From every car in the street
On repeat
On repeat

Don't tell nobody what, what you really want because
They can tell everybody else
What you really want
Then you're fucked, so
Act like it's for yourself or its all yours
And they go and tell everybody else
That you're really great
We are just people

You're enfranchised and entranced
You're enfranchised and entrenched
But know that it's yours
Real life's a compromise

But your beats half-assed streak is beating on me
Well, my drunken week is helping me sleep

I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would line the streets,
Come to every show,
No one wants that

I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would flee the schools,
Come to every show,
Drugged and unwashed

I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would line the streets,
Come to every show,
Unwashed and drugged and

And it feels like it's coming home
And it feels like it's full of love
Still in time is the great release
Something dying will be a great release

// Losing My Edge //

Yeah, I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge.
The kids are coming up from behind.
I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge to the kids from France and from London.
But I was there.

I was there in 1968. 
I was there at the first Can show in Cologne.
I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge to the kids whose footsteps I hear when they get on the decks.
I'm losing my edge to the Internet seekers who can tell me every member of every good group from 1962 to 1978.
I'm losing my edge.

To all the kids in Tokyo and Berlin.
I'm losing my edge to the art-school Brooklynites in little jackets and borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered eighties.

But I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge, but I was there.
I was there.
But I was there.

I'm losing my edge.
I'm losing my edge.
I can hear the footsteps every night on the decks.
But I was there.
I was there in 1974 at the first Suicide practices in a loft in New York City.
I was working on the organ sounds with much patience.
I was there when Captain Beefheart started up his first band.
I told him, "Don't do it that way. You'll never make a dime."
I was there.
I was the first guy playing Daft Punk to the rock kids.
I played it at CBGB's.
Everybody thought I was crazy.
We all know.
I was there.
I was there.
I've never been wrong.

I used to work in the record store. 
I had everything before anyone.
I was there in the Paradise Garage DJ booth with Larry Levan.
I was there in Jamaica during the great sound clashes.
I woke up naked on the beach in Ibiza in 1988.

But I'm losing my edge to better-looking people with better ideas and more talent.
And they're actually really, really nice.

I'm losing my edge.

I heard you have a compilation of every good song ever done by anybody.
Every great song by the Beach Boys. All the underground hits.
All the Modern Lovers tracks. I heard you have a vinyl of every Niagra record on German import.
I heard that you have a white label of every seminal Detroit techno hit - 1985, '86, '87.
I heard that you have a CD compilation of every good '60s cut and another box set from the '70s.

I hear you're buying a synthesizer and an arpeggiator and are throwing your computer out the window because you want to make something real. You want to make a Yaz record.

I hear that you and your band have sold your guitars and bought turntables. 
I hear that you and your band have sold your turntables and bought guitars.

I hear everybody that you know is more relevant than everybody that I know.

But have you seen my records? This Heat, Pere Ubu, Outsiders, Nation of Ulysses, Mars, The Trojans, The Black Dice, Todd Terry, the Germs, Section 25, Althea and Donna, Sexual Harrassment, a-ha, Pere Ubu, Dorothy Ashby, PIL, the Fania All-Stars, the Bar-Kays, the Human League, the Normal, Lou Reed, Scott Walker, Monks, Niagra,
