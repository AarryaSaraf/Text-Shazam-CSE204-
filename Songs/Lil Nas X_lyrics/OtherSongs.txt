// Panini (DaBaby Remix) //

D-D-Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny? I
It's a dream, he wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wantin' them to see me? I

I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

Just say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me
Baby, let's go, uh

Okay, this song right here remind me of my ex
Say I be declinin' all her calls and I don't respond to none of her texts
I be like, "Girl, hush your mouth, you know I ain't got time for nothin' but sex"
She know I injured my right hand so when I get behind I use my left
She watched that "Walker Texas Ranger," say I remind her of Nas X
I'm talkin' "Old Town Road," all my hoes down low
They like girls and I like girls, three at a time, sometimes four
And if my backend not all hundreds and ain't on time, then I don't go
I be like...

Say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me
What you want?

Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny now?
Now they need me, number one on streaming
Oh yeah, you used to love me
So what happened, what's the meaning? I

I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand
I need a big Benz, not another fan
But I still want you as a fan
I'ma need to sit down, don't mean to make demands
But I need you to...

Say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me

Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

[Lil Nas X:]
Oh, here we go, please let me know
Off we go, don't leave me in the cold

If I took you everywhere, then well, you wouldn't know how to walk
If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought
I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought
I didn't mean to make you mad, I don't like when you upset
I'ma call you later on, baby girl, don't you forget
I'ma take you from this party, we might go and have some sex
Or we do that later on, now we lit like cigarettes

I thought you would stay with me
I'm yours and you're mine, I envy
So what I'm gon' do?
I don't have no clue, ain't no me without you

Oh, here we go, please let me know
Off we go, don't leave me in the cold

If I took you everywhere, then well, you wouldn't know how to walk
If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought
I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought

[Nas:]
I might spin the block on twelve horses
Buy the block and get a boss bitch
Grown man, but when the Henny hit
I might Milly Rock, then get up off it
In the new days with my old ways
Game change, but the name don't
My whore-shays is they main hoes
Got a lot of them, a whole stable
I don't lie to them, it's no fables
Rap don, country flavor
Now we worldwide, we made a big brand
Now our catalog is so major
Rodeo or Rodeo
Ho-folio is so player
Tomato or tomato
Nas X or Big Nas, this shit ride

[Lil Nas X (Nas):]
Oh, here we go (Nas and Nas X), please let me know (Yeah)
Off we go (Big Nas and Lil Nas, yeah), don't leave me in the cold

[Lil Nas X:]
I thought you would stay with me
I'm yours and you're mine, I envy
So what I'm gon' do?
I don't have no clue, ain't no me without you

// Santa vs. Santa Nas X //

Ah, December, my favorite time of year
And I think you all know why, ho, ho, ho
But here, let me explain it to you with a song

It's that wonderful, special time of year
I fly around the world spreading Christmas cheer
I ride on my sleigh with my eight reindeer
And now, my friend Santa Nas X is here

Thank you Santa, my bitch, man, I'm ready to party
And I'm flyin' in my sleigh while I'm chuggin' Bacardi
And I got a big bag which you already know
Got a couple candy canes for my ho-ho-hoes

Ah, anyway
I live at the North Pole with my wife
And many happy elves, it's a happy life
I have rosy cheeks and I wear a red suit
And I top it all off with my big black boots

F... your black boots, man, I got Jimmy Choos
And I got a Lamborghini, just kiddin', I got two
I'm decked out in chrome and I .... on the daily
I don't give presents, bitch, I make the kids pay me

Maybe we should stop doing the song
Hell no, you red-nosed bastard, I'm just gettin' started
Okay

When I stop by, give me cookies and milk
Nah, I can't eat that .... boy, I got a new grill
Have a little egg nog, but not too much
F... your nog, gimme Henny in a big-ass cup
I've gotta be honest, you might deserve coal
I'ma turn that .... to diamond and buy the North Pole
I should have done a song with Rudolph or Frosty
You like to be nice, well, I like to get naughty
Naughty, naughty, naughty, yeah

Let's get naughty, turn up the track (Naughty, naughty)
Grab my sack while I count these stacks (Naughty, naughty)
Don't need reindeer, that's a fact (Naughty, naughty)
Got my hoes out front and some presents in the back (Naughty)
And .... your stockin' stuffin' (Naughty, naughty)
Nobody's gettin' nothin' (Naughty, naughty)

Alright, I've-I've heard enough
This isn't what Christmas is all about
Christmas is about presents under the tree and Rudolph and gingerbread men
It's about tradition and lights and whispering what you want while you sit on my lap
Oh, you nasty, huh?
No, no, no, that's not what I meant

Let's get naughty, turn up the track (Naughty, naughty)
Grab my sack while I count these stacks (Naughty, naughty)
Don't need reindeer, that's a fact (Naughty, naughty)
Got my hoes out front and some presents in the back
If Claus and Nas are here to stay
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays (Days, days, days, days)
Okay, go stream "HOLIDAY" now

// STAR WALKIN' (League Of Legends Worlds Anthem) //

Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'

On the mission to get high up
I know that I'ma die reachin' for a life that I don't really need at all
Never listened to replies, learned a lesson from the wise

You should never take advice from a nigga that ain't try
They said I wouldn't make it out alive
They told me I would never see the rise
That's why I gotta kill 'em every time (Gotta watch 'em bleed, too)

Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'

Been that nigga since I came out my momma (Woo)
Thankin' God daddy never wore a condom (Woo)
Prove 'em wrong every time 'til it's normal
Why worship legends when you know that you can join 'em?
Th-These niggas don't like me, they don't like me
Likely, they wanna fight me
Come on, try it out, try me
They put me down, but I never cried out
Why me?
Word from the wise:

Don't put worth inside a nigga that ain't try
They said I wouldn't make it out alive
They told me I would never see the rise
That's why I gotta kill 'em every time (Gotta watch 'em bleed, too)

Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'

Star walkin'

Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
