// Old Town Road (Remix) //

[Billy Ray Cyrus:]
Oh, oh-oh
Oh

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio)

[Lil Nas X:]
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

[Billy Ray Cyrus:]
Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rock star
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

[Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus:]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

// Panini //

Day trip took it to 10 (Hey)

Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny? I
It's a dream, he wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wanting them to see me? I

I thought you want this for my life
For my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive
You lied

Just say to me
What you want from me
Just say to me
What you want from me

Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie

Now they need me, number one on streaming
Oh, yeah, you used to love me
So what happened, what's the meaning? I

I thought you want this for my life
For my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive
You lied

Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand
I need a big Benz, not another fan
But I still want you as a fan
I'ma need to sit down, don't mean to make demands
But I need you to

Say to me
What you want from me
Just say to me
What you want from me

// Rodeo //

Daytrip took it to 10 (Hey)

[Lil Nas X:]
Oh, here we go, please let me know
Oh, 'fore you go, don't leave me in the cold

If I took you everywhere, then well, you wouldn't know how to walk
If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought
I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought

I didn't mean to make you mad, I don't like when you upset
I'ma call you later on, baby girl, don't you forget
I'ma take you from this party, we might go and have some sex
Or we do that later on, now we lit like cigarettes

I thought you would stay with me
I'm yours and you're mine, I envy
So what I'm gon' do?
I don't have no clue, ain't no me without you

Oh, here we go, please let me know
Oh, 'fore you go, don't leave me in the cold

If I took you everywhere, then well, you wouldn't know how to walk
If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought
I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought

[Cardi B:]
(Cardi)
Look, gunshot, gunshot
Thought you heard about me, must not, must not
Last nigga did me dirty, dirty
Like a bathroom in a truck stop, truck stop
Now my heart, it feels like Brillo, I'm hard like armadillo
Can't be no nigga ex, I could only be his widow (Woo)
That's a fact, dressed in black, my heart break, bones will crack
I be chilling, watching Oxygen, my favorite show is Snapped
Now you know how I get, every day, a foreign whip
Rather see you in a hearse
Than see you with some other bitch, huh (Woo, woo, woo, woo)

[Lil Nas X:]
Oh, here we go, please let me know
Oh, 'fore you go, don't leave me in the cold

If I took you everywhere, then well, you wouldn't know how to walk
If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought
I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought

I thought you would stay with me
I'm yours and you're mine, I envy
So what I'm gon' do?
I don't have no clue, ain't no me without you

// Bring U Down //

I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know but I'm gonna bring you down
I don't know but I'm gonna bring you down

I'm looking at you and I got a trick up my sleeve
And yes I'm peeping your secrets so you get ready to leave
The media's calling oh baby that's TMZ
I'm telling your secrets so best get ready to grieve

I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know but I'm gonna bring you down
I don't know but I'm gonna bring you down

I dug up your past and now I know all of your moves
And I got witnesses, statements 
And I got all of the proof
I'm wondering 'bout you 
Because I got nothing to do
I notice you're winning 
And I got nothing to lose

I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know but I'm gonna bring you down
I don't know but I'm gonna bring you down

I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know but I'm gonna bring you down
I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know what's gonna bring you down
I don't know what's gonna bring you down

// C7osure (You Like) //

True say, I want
And I need
To let go
Use my time, to be free
It's like it's always what you like
It's always what you like
Why it's always what you like
It's always what you like

Ain't no more acting man that forecast
Say I should just let me grow
No more red light for me baby
Only green I gotta' go
Pack my past up in the back
Oh let my future take a hold
This is what I gotta' do
Can't be regrettin' when I'm old

Brand new places I'll choose and I'll go
I know, embracing this news 
I behold unfolding
I know I know I know
I don't feel like it's time
But I'll look back at this moment
I'll see that I'm fine
I know I know I know
I don't feel like it's time
I set boundaries for myself
It's time to cross the line

Truth say, I want
And I need
To let go
Use my time, to be free
It's like it's always what you like
It's always what you like
Why it's always what you like
It's always what you like

Ain't no more acting man that forecast
Say I should just let me grow
No more red light for me baby
Only green I gotta' go
Pack my past up in the back
Oh let my future take a hold
This is what I gotta' do
Can't be regrettin' when I'm old

// Old Town Road //

You know what? I'm done, done, done

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
(Kio, Kio)

I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I got the—
