// Formal Introduction //

Good evening
I'd like to welcome all you ladies and gentlement, boys and girls, to the Pursuit of HappyNess
The story of Mickalascage
It's 'bout to get real greasy in this mufucka...

Moms was down with the plan, how was I scared to tell her?
Dreams of South by Southwest and Lolapalooza, Coachella
How I'm confused and won't tell her?
Like she ain't down to ride
Like she ain't fightin' the lows
Like she ain't been waitin to fly
I give a big banks to my guys, talkin' the closest of homies
Got a pound in a prayer for niggas who hate, but don't know me
Cause they ain't witness the struggle
See we piecin' the puzzle
But the picture ain't perfect and the success is so subtle
But we grind for it any day
Same way that Penny play
Crew full of JJ's
We trynna see them pennies lay
Chillin with some bitties, smoking green, and sippin' Henny straight
Brownies in the oven, we got plenty cake

// On My Mind //

Been here for a minute
Free
Be happy man

Tell 'em that I'm straight up out the Chi, and I'm reppin' that, to the def
Gotta couple homies that'll second that, reckin' rap
[?] might a second I was reckin' trap, run it back
Flippin' these trees like a lumberjack
Tell 'em that we ordered that
Smell like we imported that
We can see the bullshit, I was playin' Horace Grant
Think about it all the time, nigga we ain't forcin' shit
Think about it all the time, it's gone be unfortunate, fool

There's something on my mind
Tell 'em [x10]
Tell 'em we ain't never goin' down without a fight
Tell 'em that we pray about it every single night
Tell 'em bout the mic
And the plight, of a chi nigga
Tell 'em that Free ain't only just me and my niggas

I really just be chillin' with my niggas
Ridin' down Jordan
With some shorties
That we courting
Trynna make them feel important
OG Skywalker like Luke
I been one with the force so I ain't never had to force it
Well manicured like golf courses
Tommy Hilfiger, fuck them horses
Lamborghini, Ferrari, and boxed Porsches
Stuntin' on these niggas somethin' I don't be endorsin'
You don't really gotta brag if you got the bigger portion, fool

There's something on my mind
Tell 'em [x10]
Tell 'em we ain't never goin' down without a fight
Tell 'em that we pray about it every single night
Tell 'em bout the mic
And the plight, of a chi nigga
Tell 'em that Free ain't only just me and my niggas

Trynna cop a bigger morsel of this pie called life
Now these shorties talk about releasing sexual endorphins cause I'm fly, all right
Like a 5 star dinner with a dash of Allspice
Niggas salty cause the system has been built on faulty premises
You just want it bumpin' and I'm seein' all the blemishes
Identities deminshin'
Plus a million witnesses play apathetic
They got you in this game simply off of athletics, fool

There's something on my mind
Tell 'em [x10]
Tell 'em we ain't never goin' down without a fight
Tell 'em that we pray about it every single night
Tell 'em bout the mic
And the plight, of a chi nigga
Tell 'em that Free ain't only just me and my niggas

It's groovy
Free your mind

// The Session //

It was 6 o'clock in the eve, we thinkin' 'bout goin' H.A.M
Shots of New Amsterdam
And Key was rolling the trees
A couple shorties came through, shoulders cold as the breeze
Added a liquor shoulders increases a couple degrees
We chillin'
We laughin, We feelin'
Immaculate pad is full of some batches and bitches
Lookin' for bachelorette to doc the dab master
The ought of a first impression
I cracked a joke and she smiled and we got right back to the session
We vibin' to Mrs. Badu
Open another a bottle
Them hoes was a couple 7's and now they lookin' like models
Comfortable in her skirt
Shoulders had mellowed out
Drinks was startin' to work
Shorty was still sittin' but hips had started to twerk
Twerk
Shorty twerk
Work
Shorty work
Now peep how shit change when shoulders start to relax might lead to deep strains
And necks and arched backs might keys and key-chains
Get left
A text
In all caps that said
"Aw damn I left it"
And I be thinkin' to myself
"Aw damn my sessions" [x3]
Fool

We wasn't doin' shit
Sittin' in the crib
Niggas came through, fucked around and made it a session [x3]
[x2]

Bring a bottle
Bring some tree
Bring some shorties if you fuckin' with the free
Or be a boss, nigga bring all three
[x2]

The other night you woulda swore that we blew up
All my peoples 'round me, all this liquor on the table I was drinkin' till I threw up
Bottle in my hands told my mans pour me two up
Dapper niggas here, dope, V-Necks and crew cuts
Reset
We blew up, no recess
We too close and too Free
No deals not even close
Not even pull hoes, No Bruce Lee
More Ryu, we kicked it
Had golden and purple and light green prescriptions
Then rolled 'em and burned 'em, it might be the symptoms
That got me afloat, fool

We wasn't doin' shit
Sittin' in the crib
Niggas came through, fucked around and made it a session [x3]
[x2]

Bring a bottle
Bring some tree
Bring some shorties if you fuckin' with the free
Or be a boss, nigga bring all three
[x2]

FTMG, bro

// Tip Your Hat //

I'm just trynna be happy
[Sniffles]
Groovy

Tip yo' hat for a G if you fuckin' with that chill
Blowin' by yo' dolo and you fuckin' with that kill
Live yo' life in slow-mo and you promo what is real
They can't tell you what to wear because you free

Tell 'em bout the J. Crew socks and the Tommy Hilfiger sweater
Middle of a Alabama summer, field nigga weather
Value Village trippin' 'bout to catch a deal with the cheddar
Wicker Park pickin' niggas catchin' deals with the leather
Loafers I was rockin'
They were jazzy, I was stockin'
Had a horsey on the jacket
Didn't have another option
[?] bracelets on my wrist I can't remember when I copped 'em
I been fuckin' with that fly shit for the longest, fool

Tip yo' hat for a G if you fuckin' with that chill
Blowin' by yo' dolo and you fuckin' with that kill
Live yo' life in slow-mo and you promo what is real
They can't tell you what to wear because you free

Tell 'em that I'm straight up out the Chi
And I'm fly
91st & Langley, neighborhood guy
Went to Hirsch, off the 9
Seen to many in a herse from the 9
Lot of busted holes couple of them fine
Nevermind
Afterschool, we was cool
Chillin' on the Grove after 'bout a year
Shit changed, started gettin' chose
Seen a homie shot
On the spot
Seen shit stole
Seen a couple fights
When it's hot, niggas get froze
That's just how it goes
In the hood
Mama taught me good
Niggas didn't try me, understood
Wish a nigga would
Shorties on the block
On my jock
I was feelin' good
Got a couple numbers at a party then I told them hoes to juke, fool

Tip yo' hat for a G if you fuckin' with that chill
Blowin' by yo' dolo and you fuckin' with that kill
Live yo' life in slow-mo and you promo what is real
They can't tell you what to wear because you free

Aw
Oh
(Put them shoes on and keep my paper runnin')
Yeah, listen up
(Put them shoes on and keep my paper runnin')
Tell 'em bout the A-Life loafers with the tassels
Camo on the cargos, laces be a hassle
Tell 'em haters all about this vintage shit I'm thriftin
We don't listen
Save yo money, this a different type of pimpin'
Can you buy that?

It was $35, 000, $35, 000 cash money
Wha-No, I get one-$35, 000+1, right?
The one I gave you
No you gave me 6, alright?
That was one
I had one that was 6 and the $35,000 + 6 + 1 makes 7.
$35, 000 and 7, alright? Motherfucker, can you buy that?

Tip yo' hat for a G if you fuckin' with that chill
Blowin' by yo' dolo and you fuckin' with that kill
Live yo' life in slow-mo and you promo what is real
They can't tell you what to wear because you free

// Happy Thoughts //

[Yawns]
We're gonna do something a little different here for ya folks
Free...
[Clears throat, sniffles]
It's gonna be really groovy, man

Marijuana rollin'
Keep them bottles comin', models comin'
Take a seat, be fake with me cause they know I got dollas comin'
This is what it takes to be happy?
Please...
Don't let them bleed yo' mind
My nigga just free yo' mind
I hope you can see it nigga, been prayin' for peace/piece of mind

Chiefin' on leafy greens and thinkin' just like LeBron
The 4th quarter's up on us, I'm hopin' we finish strong
Prop and Chris do too much I'm just hopin' we finish song
Niggas be smokin' with' us and hopin' to finish bongs
The quotes is what's really potent, the focus is on what's wrong
The message is in yo' mind, I'm hopin' you sing along
I know you gone listen close, I just hope that you see the prob

Marijuana rollin'
Keep them bottles comin', models comin'
Take a seat, be fake with me cause they know I got dollas comin'
This is what it takes to be happy?
Please...
Don't let them bleed yo' mind
My nigga just free yo' mind
I hope you can see it nigga, been prayin' for peace/piece of mind

Still feelin' peachy kings save this peach drink, they be divine
Calypso it be the bomb, tell 'em about it Mick
HappyNess is for the free, you can tell 'em about the clique
How we tell 'em about our hearts, or we tell 'em about a brick
Gotta break it down for these niggas then sell it out on the strip
Off the strength
We isn't whack
And they feelin' a couple tracks
And I'm movin' like Nicky Bond so I'm flipin' a couple packs, of this brick
Music you hearin' I'm chillin' with all my niggas
New Amsterdam in my Sprite
I'm happy without that life
A master plan in my sights
Keep it tight
When I right, fool
And keep that

Marijuana rollin'
Keep them bottles comin', models comin'
Take a seat, be fake with me cause they know I got dollas comin'
This is what it takes to be happy?
Please...
Don't let them bleed yo' mind
My nigga just free yo' mind
I hope you can see it nigga, been prayin' for peace/piece of mind

Free
I told you it was gonna be groovy man

// Happily Screwed Interlude //

I just want be happy, tell the haters is that too much to ask?

I just want be happy, so I pray that's not too much to ask?
Pray that's not too much to ask
Pray that's not too much...

The piff twisted, aw yes
The Bic lit it
Big hit, a quick lift
We get bent like arm rests
And think about the days when I wasn't prayin', didn't talk to God
I'm amazed that I fuckin' made it, I'm so fuckin' far
From where I used to be
Y'all niggas best get used to me
Cool
In this Hilfiger shirt cause that other shit just uncool to me, fool
I'm talkin' Ivy Crew Chinos, off white Chucks
Cause the suede bucks
Got a scuff
Had to put 'em up
Wallet back, left pocket, nothin' tough, just a couple bucks
Chillin' with my shawty watchin' Netflix smoking coupled up
Ginger-Ale and Apple Juice is fizzin' in my double cup
Meal is in the oven and my Bible on the TV stand
Mind is on the message you can see me playin', fool

I just want be happy, tell the haters is that too much to ask?
I just want be happy, tell my mom is that too much to ask?
I just want be happy, so I pray that's not too much to ask?
Pray that's not too much to ask
Pray that's not too much...

// The Mike Love Joint //

Be happy

Turn the
Volume up on yo' factory ass system
These niggas claimin' they killas I've actually had victims, I've slaughtered
Call them trill but, they fathers think they had daughters
My mama think I'm an author
I'll prolly be a martyr

If I don't
Talk about cash
How all these hoes got all of that ass
Sippin' on that gin n' that juice and then party [?], you see [?] and them rollin' up grass
Livin' so fast
This under 200 up on my dash
Foot on the gas
Movin' so quick
All of my people gone think I'm the shit
What if I switch
What if I switched it on these niggas
Got a little different on these niggas
What if my drive was a little faster like a stick-shift on these niggas
They so twisted, oh these niggas
They just lie, so sadistic
Never simplistic
Out here dancin' for these crackers toss 'em a Triscuit
Then I switch it
Yo' people come up missin'
Coroner check ballistics
Ask me about a ad-lib, I told them I was gettin' lifted
AKA reading scripture
Know this world ain't no picnic
You trynna dipshit you with' it, my nigga
Switch it, get with it my nigga
Raw papers twisted
The piff is spliffful, simplistic my nigga
That's how my life has been livin'
I mean get with it my nigga
Get with it my nigga
I hope you with it my nigga
If you can't hear it
Then

Turn the
Volume up on yo' factory ass system
These niggas claimin' they killas I've actually had victims, I've slaughtered
Call them trill but, they fathers think they had daughters
My mama think I'm an author
I'll prolly be a martyr

I'll prolly end up a martyr [x2]
It's the Pursuit of HappyNess
Fool

// We Out Here //

[Chorus x2:]
You know the hater's gone hate
But my homies gone be down to ride, so we out here
You know they always gone hate
But my niggas gone be down to ride, so we out here

Fool

I swear to God, I'll be hookin' niggas up
When it's time to leave, got you in that box, hope you box, hope you bob and weave
They done had the nation on lock since the colonies
But I'd rather stand high and die than live on my knees
I told my closest niggas tell those who don't know
Fuck a YOLO
I'm trynna live life in slow-mo
Take a photo
Maybe invest in Acapulco, gold homie
And y'all only impressin' in these hoes, homie
I'm chillin' with women
And they feelin' my threads
Vintage Tommy Hilfiger and a breeze like linen, grinin'
When you see me, but I'm down to EarthProlly had a pound of earth, in my life time
Just blow trees and write rhymes
Goat cheese and white wine
Ho please, I'm quite fine
Like nose bleeds
You won't see
These proceeds
'Less I shine
Plus we flowin' underground like the Pipeline
Trynna save the world with tight rhymes
Yeah we fightin' crime

[Chorus]

[Playboy Prob:]
I got my eyes on the prize, playin' for it
Naw, I'm prayin' for it
Hustle by the hour of power just like I'm playin' forward
Just know I'm slangin' for it
Even if you can't afford it
It's irony would have it free, shit you payin' for it
That's if you want a verse or even just to lay a chorus
Damn, lay before us all of ya plans while they record us
I know you salty, take a flight, you came to board it
My game imported
So I laugh and watch you play a tourist
You niggas make me laugh
Naw, really
I speak hustla' fluently so I can play thesaurus
I know my niggas takin' over and you can't ignore it
Fuckin' with broad niggas, baby drop you can't abort it
You see the chick I'm workin' with and say you can't afford it
You try to soap up all this dolla shit, you can't absorb it
Ask about me boa, Prop is a rida'
Hotta than a few inches of lava
Chill out

[Chorus]

[Outro x2:]
They gone hate you
They can't break you
If you still here, dog, then just stay faithful

Just stay thankful
Just stay grateful
You just remember homie they can't break you
They gone hate you
They can't break you
If you still here, dog, then just stay faithful

[Chorus]

// You Been Told //

Free...

[CiaraKai:]
I don't know what you've been told
But I ain't like nobody else you ever met before
Who you think you dealin' with?

[Mick Jenkins:]
The different right from the start
Peg Cuff in my denim
Tuckin' in all my t-shirts, the loafers got pennies in 'em
Been reckless with plenty women
That know this hawk is McGill
Sir and Madam the collar, a pocket square just for thrills
Docker's a dollar bill
Ale of Ginger I sip it and Styrofoam just for trill
Gotta know he's to real
Gotta know just like dominoes all you niggas gone fall
For lookin' just like each other it's a comin' of mass appeal
Floral the Ralph Lauren
Straight from the year I'm born in
I strap up the saddle different cause all them horses be borin'
And all them sneakers be Jordan
But quality is what's missin', the moccasins stir-craft, the Abbington boots I've thrifted
If you talkin' bout clothes? I'll muthafuckin' embarrass you
Walkin' with a parachute
Sucka' for a pair of shoes
Mixin' different fabrics that yo' daddy wouldn't dare to do
And all this for the low-low tell me nigga, it ain't fair to you

[CiaraKai:]
I don't know what you've been told
But I ain't like nobody else you ever met before
Who you think you dealin' with?

[CiaraKai:]
Why you think you know me?
Listenin' to yo' homies
But I ain't like nobody else you ever met before
I'm on another level
Whether it's high or low (doesn't really matter)
Who you think you dealin' with?
I've been out here for a while
You mogs can't catch my style
I ain't nothin' like nobody else you ever met before

// Talkin $hit //

[Mick Jenkins & jSTOCK:]
[Yawns]
Yahhhh
Ahaaa
[Laughs]
FTMG
What'cha know about it?
Yahh

[Mick Jenkins:]
Trynna had a peace sign on the keys to the whip
Piece, pipe, pass, and keef on the spliff
Trynna keep the peace, tell yo' homies to relax cause it's homies in the Chi with the piece on the hip
Put the message to yo' mind, get the keys to your heart
Then I stunt like a nigga puttin' keys on the strip
Like 12 in the trunk in the old day Wu
Ginger-Ale in my cup and some OJ too
Talk a '09 Chi with the Cocaine Coupe
And you already knew that the top J. Crew
Ya know I got love for the tri-state few
With the rubber bandannas so the socks stay viewed
Niggas don't gas, I ain't runnin' out of fuel
Shit gettin' hot and I ain't runnin out of cool
[?] on the wrist gettin' wet cause I'm draped and I'm dripped like I'm running out the pool
Gotta face of the piff and I'm running with the crew
Dollas in ya pocket if you ridin' with the Free
Call a couple niggas and we pile in the car with my knees to the seat like I'm ridin' with police
Girl gettin' spoiled like a tub of cottage cheese
Ridin' through the streets like I'm reppin' Cottage Grove
Hop up out the drop
At the spot
And it's hot
Give a dap to the niggas and a nod to the hoes

[Mick Jenkins:]
So let me talk my shit, bruh
Let me talk my shit, fool
Let me talk my shit, cause
Let me talk my shit
Gone and talk it if you walk it, nigga
Whip it like you hawkin', nigga
Fresh to death and nothin' less
They just might have to chalk it, nigga

[jSTOCK:]
I'm with the free, try and get a ring
Sober hippy, blue dreams
Went to bed with them old plans, waking up with them new schemes
Young pharaoh, kiss the ring
5D, Hennessy, and chicken wings
Tried to drop some jewels on niggas, but dumb ass niggas ain't listening
Bitch ass nigga this the Christening
Pop the rose, sip the pink
Roll another one every time you blink
Drop another song every time you think
Niggas was dumb, but we still havin' fun [?] stuns calm down when I had the sink
Brainstorm, let it rain
Out of my mind, I need a shrink
Nickname Burman and P-Rop
Rollin' up some of that mean pot
Running that shit 'till our knees lock
Holes on the pole like a ski shot
So it's no hope, no wishes
Free whole bars like soap dishes
Young nigga shine cause the gold with us
So fuck choosin' one, bring both bitches

[Mick Jenkins:]
So let me talk my shit, bruh
Let me talk my shit, fool
Let me talk my shit, cause
Let me talk my shit
Gone and talk it if you walk it, nigga
I don't even do this often, nigga
Y'all can bet, it's effortless, you best proceed with caution, nigga
[x2]

[Mick Jenkins:]
I've been ridin' through the 'ville
Ignorin' the [?]
Dismissin' the niggas that's claiming they poppin' choppas
On my solo, dolo
Or maybe with this honey, dog, skin buttered up from the coco
Tell me what'chu know about a life where you grind all day
Like DeShawn white pipe dream might [?] way
And you get it in the dark, fool
Gotta get it how you live
Nigga gotta problem with a nigga that ain't got it, but he always talkin' shit
Funny how it get a nigga pissed

[Mick Jenkins:]
Money always fuck a nigga up
Funny how it get a nigga dissed
Honeys always look a nigga up
Soon as he get that check
They at yo' neck
Everybody wanna be down
Everybody wanna be 'round
Even them squares
Niggas out here pullin' up a chair
Honeys out here [?] with the stairs
Is it cause that other shit stale?
Is it all this fuckin' Ginger-Ale?
Is it all the thrift shit?
Is it that apparent with the piff [?]
Is it that we bring it in the mail?
Said you can't tell
Sure it ain't the fuckin' Ginger-Ale

[Mick Jenkins:]
Ahaaa

Are you hapy now?
You niggas got me talkin' shit
[x2]

Well I'm gone and talk it cause I walk it, nigga
I don't even do this often, nigga
Y'all can bet, it's effortless, you best proceed with caution, nigga

// Ox N Pab, Again //

[Pab:] Shit, don't come at me nigga. What makes you happy?
[Ox:] Shittt, what makes me happy? Dog, all I need is like the fam straight (you feel me?), my girl, a bangin' ass relationship with God, and some peach drink, my nigga
[Pab:] [laughs]
[Ox:] That's it, really

// Brake Lights //

Had to gone and get on my south shit one time, cause
Free
Fuck with it

Everybody wanna live so fast, tell 'em slow it down
Heavy footed ass, on the gas, tell 'em slow it down
We gone blow it down, drop a ash
Better pick it up
Switch it up
Fuck with Free and listen, up
[x2]

Wake up
Talk to God, then bake up
Chest was kind of heavy, but he blessed me now this shit feel like some A-Cups
Calm down cause a nigga on his way up
On the grind, tell my mama don't wake up
I'm trynna focus on, my closest folks, cause it's niggas here wearin' make-up
And how I'm 'posed to know, if I'm focused on these bold hoes and they make-up
That rose mold when I wake up
Little rose gold in my Jacob
All the hoes know
I get so throwed, when I'm draped up and dripped out
That'll have my old girl tripped out
That'll have my whole shit fucked up
And we know this
But we always buy the dranks
And we always tell the hoes
And we always got one rolled
Fuck it, roll a couple mo'
Fo' my homies and they honeys
Living fast and smoking good let's get this money

Everybody wanna live so fast, tell 'em slow it down
Heavy footed ass, on the gas, tell 'em slow it down
We gone blow it down, drop a ash
Better pick it up
Switch it up
Fuck with Free and listen, up
[x2]

Ginger-Ale in my Styrofoam cup, tuck and rollin' these Raws
I want happiness and that's happenin' but it's tough ignorin' these flaws
Fresh hands comfort these balls
And them dames come for these drawls
And I gotta main and I keep it plain, but it's tough ignorin' these cause
I be chillin' tho
With that [?] on my wrist
Nigga get popular and them squares jock like it's Damier on my dick
Ordered up Dominoes, they got 30 minutes, no automer on my wrist
Niggas playing dominoes, we just cold chillin', that's the ambiance of my clique
Niggas gone dominate with these old flows
And I prominate in these old clothes
I'm just waitin', dog, it take's patience, dog for this Provolone
And we know this
But we always buy the dranks
And we always tell the hoes
And we always got one rolled
Fuck it, roll a couple mo'

Everybody wanna live so fast, tell 'em slow it down
Heavy footed ass, on the gas, tell 'em slow it down
We gone blow it down, drop a ash
Better pick it up
Switch it up
Fuck with Free and listen, up
[x2]

Listen up, playin' ahead, dog
Or you dead, dog
Got no helmet and they comin' at yo' head, dog

// Gang Bang //

It's the pursuit of happiness
Free, peanut butter leather loafers fool
What you know about it

Peanut butter leather loafers
Ginger ale on coasters, never play your hand
Life is Texas hold 'em poker, life is sex and hoes and posing to these other niggas
We be lighting, vegetables on fire blowing smoke on to these other niggas campaigns
Got to keep it real to maintain
Food for your soul talking rice and peas and plantains
Food for the hoes, they gone buy weed and champagne
That ain't worth a damn thing

Had to reassess who I impress to be the best
How am I supposed to be up next if we just all gone say the same thing
Walking in the same lane
Locked up in the same box, that sound like a chain gang
We can't all pick the same locks, that sound like a gang bang
This ain't no fuckin' gang bang [x4]
This ain't no fuckin' gang...
Peanut butter leather loafers
Ginger-Ale on coasters, never play your hand
Life is Texas hold em' poker
Life is sex and hoes and posing to these other niggas

We be like them Eskimos on fire, so much fuckin' colder than them other niggas campaigns
You know I'm riding for the fam-lay
You know I'm riding if a nigga left with her
You know I'm pulling on the hand brake
You know I'm higher either rolling up and then you know I'm in the cut like Band-Aid
New world band days, got the whole world thinking pancakes but it's not that sweet
Don't you ever let 'em drive back seat, when these boys band like the Backstreet
Nigga it's gone be a fuckin' track meet, how we run ya'll round this damn thing
All these niggas want some damn fame

Had to reassess who I impress to be the best
How am I supposed to be up next if we just all gone say the same thing
Walking in the same lane
Locked up in the same box, that sound like a chain gang
We can't all pick the same locks, that sound like a gang bang
This ain't no fuckin' gang bang [x4]
This ain't no fuckin' gang...
Peanut butter leather loafers
Ginger-Ale on coasters, never play your hand
Life is Texas hold em' poker
Life is sex and hoes and posing to these other niggas

We be lighting, vegetables on fire blowing smoke on to these other niggas campaigns
Got to keep it real to maintain
This ain't no fuckin' gang bang
This ain't no fuckin' game, fool

// A.M.F.O.S. Interlude //

Rollin' up the tree
Ridin' with the Free
Prayin' for piece/peace of mind, it's wild out in these streets
Don't wild out in these streets
They got you by the collar
I hope and pray you never fall in love with no dolla
Holla
If you niggas hear me
If you take the path we take, the feat it's gone be weary
If you prayin' ask for grace, I hope you hear him clearly
If you take a half a day
Repent for sins that past away
Yo' heart won't be no castaway
When judgement day is near-ey
Holla if you hear me
Holla, holla
Holla if you hear me
Holla Holla
Holla if you hear me, fool

5 deep when we roll out
Stale face is for the shook niggas
We Mobb Deep when we roll out
Bail cases on books, niggas
North Face cheap cause it's cold out
Tailgatin' we cook niggas
You'll never say that we sold out
Never say that we sold out
Got way too much on my mind
If you ain't 'bout shit and we talkin' you already wasting too much of my time
Bet you could taste the love in my rhyme
If it was me and you niggas could see all the bitches I bet you'd make a [?]
I double take a fucking rewind
The bubble tape will fuckin' stretch out
Look at my face, I'm fuckin' stressed out
Fuckin' impatient the medical patient, this blunt to my face, I poke my chest out
Won't get complacent, I'm focused in facing the music I'm paced to the best out
It's gone be niggas gettin' left out
It's gone be niggas leasin' less [?]
Just for a [?] piece of that pie

Rollin' up the tree
Ridin' with the Free
Prayin' for piece/peace of mind, it's wild out in these streets
Don't wild out in these streets
They got you by the collar
I hope and pray you never fall in love with no dolla
Holla
If you niggas hear me
If you take the path we take, the feat it's gone be weary
If you prayin' ask for grace, I hope you hear him clearly
If you take a half a day
Repent for sins that past away
Yo' heart won't be no castaway
When judgement day is near-ey
Holla if you hear me
Holla, holla
Holla if you hear me
Holla Holla
Holla if you hear me, fool

And this has been a message from our sponsors:
Stay Free
Stay Cool
Be happy, nigga

// Mirage (Outro) //

Free your mind
Wake up! [x4]
Uh

You'll never know how hard it is to make it look easy
And I ain't stuntin', no, I just don't wanna look needy
Cause these days documentaries and books feed me
But paper's light so I guess that's why I look greedy
That's why the Free in here developin' a plan
Cause Rhonda Cross and Shonda only helpin' when they can
You see, now-a-days everybody need a helpin' hand
And the air wave on side to side, homie tell a friend
Tell a fan
Maybe they'll throw a hunnit for the show
I mean these niggas out here throwin' hunnits at these hoes
I used to have a homie throwin' hunnits for the blow
Tell me he could smell the rose blood runnin' from his nose, but he can't
And he won't
So we push him harder
Fort of doom in a room full of kush and authors
Gotta broom for the bullshit they leave behind
But that's the flow and it's the reason we don't push for doctors
We are, self medicated, levitating through my whole day
Here a beat and rip a beat, nigga that's the old way
I'm trynna float a message in a bottle
Full throttle
To the back of your cerebral
We gone heal the people
Wassup?

Wake up [x6]
Fool

[Dijon:]
Sleepin' every day and night [x3]
But I bet you think your eyes wide open
Sleepless fools can't stay at fight
Y'all ain't goin' no where
Y'all ain't doin' nothing
Y'all niggas ain't got no back bone
Y'all niggas just frontin'
Turn around
And you happy
Turn around
You happy
Turn around
All those fly
Turn around
But you happy

Free
