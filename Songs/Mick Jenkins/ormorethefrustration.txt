// Go Time //

Work? Fuck you wanna be on the streets talkin' about what you do for, and you ain't doin' it. Fuck you wanna be in the club lookin' like you do somethin' for, and you ain't really do it. Fuck you wanna stand next to a nigga like me that really do it, and you don't do it
The fuck from about me man. Feel me? I think Imma have a beautiful bitch next to me. A nigga all over my fuckin' shit, what you talkin' about, nigga? Man, get the fuck off me man. Write a rap man, or spit a si- go eat or so- go make a beat or somethin'. You niggas lookin' hungry, eat you some...

Hella underrated these days, that shit the worst
Makes me think back to that Hov line
The meek shall inherit the earth
What, You was thinkin' Mr. Carter? nah
I been singin' like his daughter name
I heard him talk about the Audemar
Fuck the watches, I'm just talkin' timing
Fuck the tactful, I ain't talkin' timid
Servin' love, we been talkin' tennis
I ain't even gotta talk advantage
What's the budget? Now I'm talkin' spanish
Fuck a nigga tryna talk opinions, I like to deal with the factual
I like to deal with the actual
I hear the words, but I like to focus on actions
Only the real in my faction
Flushed out the fakes, now we fractions of that
You know, fuck it, it happens
Rolled up the gas and walked out the crib like fuck it, fashion
This ain't nothin' but some trees from last year
Hit the scheme on my VC niggas
On the same schemes from last year
And I'm light years past you

"Seen you bro him up in black Saab, the gold bbs, man
I said, this nigga, this nigga's really makin this money and his really makin money, man, You understand?"
"Ay, it ain't just about the money. It's not. You know what it's about? "

// Rags //

Yeah yeah yeah
Stepped up out the Gucci store with the tall bag
Feeling like a tall glass of water, fuck the holsters though
Looking at me all cheaply
And I ain't even looking for the price tag or my reciept
Bitch you got me fucked up
But let me digress
You read the transcript its more reader's digest than poems really
This ain't Poseidon, its Noah really
A Joakim went triple double him was going silly
Gotta face the facts with this
I'm multi-faceted
From the Atlantic to the Pacific
You catch me everything but pacifist
We smoking strong
Like bad flatuace we passing gas
I'm mad adamant about that
Don't ever doubt that
You looking for cheese, you end up in mousetraps
You running with leeches you end up with Count Dracs
The type who like your North Face
You end up coming up out that
Niggas lucky I was never 'bout that
I'm with my American plug at European outlets
Seven hours ahead so this shit ain't out yet ow

How you like me now, got to wipe me down
Even your moms think I'm clean, who's the mother fuckin' hypebeast now
Yeah
Blowing bags on these rags just to feel myself
What
Blowing bags on these rags just to feel myself
What
Yeah

Blowing bags on these rags just to feel myself
I was thrifting when I wasn't out here sipping on wealth
Copping bags of them rags just to feel myself
I had the thrift shop rockin' before Macklemore been that nigga

Uh
Bitter figures these days, you niggas move so
On my sumo, we don't do no pseudo-science
Wrist on Michael Rousseau
No jewels on me
We no fools homie
See the squares but we looking for loopholes
Numero uno, fuck who you know
I pull the draw before I play it cool though
Just off the niggas who won't complete the mission
I need submission like we doing judo
And got the llama you throw off my groove
This ain't Cuzco you fucking with
I don't usually hold heat like makeshift oven mitts
But I get the job done
I'm not one to freeze up, no polio
Napolean complex never hear my logic
Diversifying my portfolio, securing profits
And all that's just residual knowledge like fuck college
Ay
Fuck lemon pledge my shit polished, I'm not Amish
I been modest as them though
Although I ride the tempo like Waldo
You can't find him until you spot him
And the you can't stop looking at that spot
Sure I'm looking at the top with my plot
Niggas on suicide watch when I drop
Uh
Six-five, look like Sasquatch in the drop
She got thick thighs, got a fat knot
In my pocket
Came from them rags with the colored tags
To them tags with the commas spliced
Check the price, nigga stop it
They say if I buy expensive shit I ain't conscious

I don't really like to be around mother fuckers
You know
I just like to stay to myself and with my immediate niggas
And its kind of hard to do if
You in the lime light
Cause they'll look at ou like
Know what I'm saying
Oh he got an ego
He don't really associate with nobody
You know
When you
You gotta, you gotta play the role
You gotta smile up in mother fuckers faces
You gotta go places you may not wanna go
You have to do things you may not wanna do
And, and its hard
And its still hard
I don't really fuck with niggas no more
Like I did

// Cry If You Want (FYP) //

Ay fuck your party
Ay fuck your party

Ya party on my own shit
Probably leavin early on some grown shit
Lil baby lil booty got the force
And of course, 30 of the same niggas come up short
This some attack of clones shit
Lady I'm no jedi with these red eyes
I've been squinting to see
Something better, your addition makes no difference to we
Got my woman, you bet I don't got bitches with me
I'm like popeye off his spinach
I need feta, I need cheddar
What I don't need is these niggas trying to whisper to me
When the music is loud, while I'm twisting this tree
And don't go fixing your lips to kick up some fiction
We well equipped for the friction, you talkin slick you should quit it
My nigga give me some space
This ain't the time or place
I'm trying to catch me a vibe
And you coming all up in my face

Ay fuck your party

Niggas in here mobbin on some clone shit
Niggas in here ashy, need some lotion
I move with oceans, they know I swim good
I'm poured up, this water potent
They know I sip good
I sin bad, I try to tip good
I'm growing, still loaded
Uploading, upgrading
Upholding these statments
I'm focused, I'm smoking

I might blow a whole zone in this mother fucker
I might blow the ozone in this mother fucker (loud)
I might blow a whole zone in this mother fucker
I might blow a

// 6AM Matinee //

I had a quarter in my pocket
Three day bus pass and some patience
Two-three bussdowns hit the house phone
While my momma sleep, I promise

We was on this fly shit early
We was on the thrift shit early
We respected women early
Had to learn a few things

We was dodging bullets early
And I knew the law from early
And the strap was on me early
I was the first one with gbos [?]
I was in class with all my foes
So I cut class like twice a week
But I knew Jesus since a youngin'
I was never on my own
I had the knowledge on me early
I knew violence from an early age
I knew dollars couldn't save me
Way more focused on the pearly gates
I pearl a blunt, we perforate
Y'all perpetrate, more purposeful
More personal
This ain't for your purchasing
Momma popped the Prednisone
Stress was on our pressure points
Pandering to pantomimes
Fuck all the semantics
Me and my bottomline won't stand in line
I've been hip
Y'all been stiffs
And I've been peeped
And I've been dipped

Unzip and smoke the quarter in my pocket
Three day bus pass and some patience
Two-three bussdowns hit the house phone
While my momma sleep

I promise, we was on this fly shit early
We was on that thrift shit early
We respected women early
Had to learn a few things

The early bird gets the worm
These niggas still sleeping
The early bird gets the worm
These niggas still sleep

I promise, we was on that fly shit early
We was on that thrift shit early
We respected women early
Had to learn a few things

The early bird gets the worm
These niggas still sleepin

Been stuck in the basement like the fusebox
Getting it off my chest, so tube top
Like, I'm more tube sock
Coming after your achilles
You'll eventually feel me
No more Heelies for you
Just back to the floor and ceilings for views
Got em feeling abused
Don't feature me on your record or I'm stealing a few
I write a feature presentation on your shit
With a matchstick you'll get the award for best supporting actress
Withstanding heat I'll hold that water like a cactus
Y'all niggas average
Tending burns in the mirror rubbing aloe vera online
You suberbad in real life
You Michael Cera, all that McLovin
All that dick hugging these niggas do
No kung, these niggas fu
Its pitiful, not Mr. T, we don't pity fools
Just get at you
Bless your crew, turn many to few
Now what the fuck you really wanna do?

// Earl Sweatshirt Type Beat //

Uh
I still fuck with type beats off-
(Let that shit breathe right there man)
(I want people to think about that shit for a second)
(Mick Jenkins, give that man a round of applause)

I still fuck with type beats off YouTube
Like fuck the who's who
Of the producers that you used to
May think I'm loco
Every L just start a lesson, that's blessings by the bookoo
Common sense just not that common, cop the Gucci Coco
Common projects from the projects to that luxury lame shit
Just a fancy high rise man, its really the same shit
I'm ducked off the pills and speaking Spanglish
We don't wave no banners star spangled, there's too much anguish
In recent history, no mystery here
Bring the froggy feelings, fuck a foggy memory
I'm meant to be clear, as crystal
Even my momma copped a pistol
I need the shotty, through your body
Like a chill, we don't know no chill
Uppercuts to your grill on my George Foreman
Animals with me like I'm George Orwell
You been forewarned boy, I'm brainstorming
I'm up late, no James Quarter, no camcorders
They never see you when you work this hard
They always see you, you don't work enough
I play my cards, let you work the bluff
I [?] the curtains up
The show is live
These sad boys got y'all perkin' up
I'm getting sicker can't you see me coughin' verses up
Only a few games until my crew gain
Six figures in a hole, I was Saddam Hussein
This time last year back in the black
And know I stack, rinse, and repeat
Ain't missed a beat
Huh
Might miss a few mills to cook up a beat
You know how it be

// Walk Different //

[Michael Jordan:]
He said I conned the players, I befriended them
And then I attacked them on the basketball court
Where did that come from
I just so happen to be a friendly guy
I get along with everybody, but at the same time
When the light comes on I'm just as competitive as anybody you know

[Mick Jenkins:]
Pigeon holed
Not me, walk different like I'm pigeon-toed
Smooth footed, bow-legged long as niggas know
We not the same, give a fuck bout what you did before
You get the real me, twist your fingers if you figured you'd deal me
Don't show no ceilings, I don't need them either
I got the plumbing, you won't see Luigi
Keep a squeegee I can see me clearer
When I'm looking through a window than I can in a mirror
Putting the fear of God in a pen
Can bring green thumbs deep in the garden
I'm watching for snakes, I'm watching for Jakes
Head in the clouds, my eyes were watching God
And all these niggas say I'm walking odd
Time travel when I slow creep out the parking lot
Murdered out
Trust me I ain't nobody you heard about
You niggas best believe I like to keep it that way
I know the fear spread quick and niggas she-bitch that way
I'm peeping that daily, its crazy, its driving me crazy
I'm saying

// Blessed Assurance //

[Sean Deaux:]
I need blessed assurance
Treat me just like the weed
Make me feel important
The higher up the better I feel (yeah yeah)
Backwood vacations while I'm in the field
Like bang, bang, bang
I need to get away and smoke
When I need to free my mind I smoke (yeah yeah)
We light up like Christmas time and smoke (yeah yeah)
Kush-ups that's exercise and smoke
Like bang, bang, bang
I-I need to get away

[Mick Jenkins:]
Puff puff then pass
Don't boof the wood
Just promise me that
We got all the smoke nigga
You don't want no smoke nigga
I can't even smoke witcha'
? yolked
I been makin' omelettes of niggas
Shit gon' shatter gon' crumble when I concentrate fuckin' with the conscious of niggas
That type of flower uncommon
Taste it when I smell it my palate is polished
My roses are budded and I'm tryna' cross-pollinate
Niggas still sleepin' cause the indica dominate
Know that I cannot accommodate Reggie
Labels get to dancin' on the ceilin' 'fore they billow out the window floatin' straight up to the heavens though
I hold it in and let it go

[Sean Deaux:]
I need blessed assurance
Treat me just like the weed
Make me feel important
The higher up the better I feel (yeah yeah)
Backwood vacations while I'm in the field
Like bang, bang, bang
I need to get away and smoke
When I need to free my mind I smoke (yeah yeah)
We light up like Christmas time and smoke (yeah yeah)
Kush-ups that's exercise and smoke
Like bang, bang, bang
I-I need to get away and smoke
