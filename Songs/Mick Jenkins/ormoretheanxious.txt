// Happy Gilmore //

"The fact that... so many people outside the culture of Chicago, they hyped up the music not knowing that real lives would be affected. All the type of madness happened within the music, and the music was a real life depiction of that. How'd you feel about that?"
"I wanted to slap you in your face, honestly..."
"The hell are you doi-agh!"

Tryna spit my shit, you'd likely slit your throat
You bitch niggas ain't Piccolo
Ain't no comeback kid, eight fingers on thumbtack, kid
I'm just open-handed slapping niggas
Happy Gilmore tactics, catch you slipping if he carve up the ice
Princess cuts in my flows, this nigga in here lighting squares like he no Vanna White
It's funny, I'm just in here copping some O's
Serve me a QP for a G
Back on the street, I'm in a steamer with a hoodie on
(Bro, y'all niggas hot as hell)
It turn to a sauna with them boys behind us
Niggas in Pilsen, not Paris, they still gon' have to find us
My security blanket damn manifest like Linus
Sharp as Steve Harvey linen in the nine nineties
A young black man more honest than he's non-violent
'Cause sometimes niggas need they ass beat, foreal, yeah
I don't fuck with collagen, don't do no apologin'
I don't fix my lips for these niggas
I'ma say what's on my mind, a hundred all of the time
You can suck a nigga dick, you feel different
I would tell it to my bros, I don' told it to my foes
If you think I'm on some shit, you should listen
I'ma look you in your face if I hit you
Give a fuck about your clique or who with you, nigga

It could be one or two or three or four... or more
Or more (one) or more (one, two)
Or more (one) or more

// C Is For CashMoney //

The letter I would like to go into with you very briefly is the letter "C". It is one of my favorites. Oh, it's very underrated, in terms of letters, you know, very few people sit around and comment on the virtues of the letter "C". But it is the first letter in "Cash Money", it is the first letter in "constitution" and it is the last letter in "music"

Oh, y'all niggas see me now?
Yeah, know you can smell what I'm cooking
I caught you looking, oh you see me now?
Y'all niggas fronting before, you stunted on flows
But you say you see me now?
You was stuck on division, you couldn't fuck with the vision
But you see me now
Aaah, you see me now

I caught 'em slipping, he capping on this water
No captain, the waves is crashing around him
He's Peter, screaming, "Come catch me"
The faith is lacking, he can't keep running the numbers
But all he's catching is cramps
He be with shooters, all my niggas got clamps
We clearly cultured, been collecting the stamps
Of different nations, my caution
In the wind with the smoke from all of my coughing
In Amsterdam, I drink coffee and dodge all the cancer clouds on
My campfire like teacher's name
I can't be more cohesive than truth
A culmination of lies, a compilation of proof
A combination of both is what creates all this confusion
Your captions don't save nobody
They castrating my body on camera
Credit Montreal, I been considering Canada
I can play chameleon, slip through customs in a pinch
I play Charmeleon on this flame I pitch
Don't act like ya'll niggas don't hate my shit

Oh, y'all niggas see me now?
(Oh it's very underrated)
Yeah, know you can smell what I'm cooking
I caught you looking, oh you see me now?
Y'all niggas fronting before, you stunted on flows
But you say you see me now?
You was stuck on division, you couldn't fuck with the vision
But you see me now
Aaah, you see me now

I came to claim and
Contrary to an unpopular consensus
I have not conceded my position
Merely concentrated my condition
And no competition but myself
Convinced that constant praying conviction could
Cultivate any depiction of reality he sees fit
That's why I try to speak it cryptic
Copious amounts of knowledge
You know they do recon missions
Try to keep it low-key, I peep energies
Though something 'bout your chemistry concerns me
Counter-culture enemies lurking and I know they see me
I know they think I'm Stevie, I'm really Bartimaeus
All my jabs is Cassius Clay
I could hook a shark in this water
Where to start, where you at?

Oh, y'all niggas see me now?
Yeah, know you can smell what I'm cooking
I caught you looking, oh you see me now?
Y'all niggas fronting before, you stunted on flows
But you say you see me now?
You was stuck on division, you couldn't fuck with the vision
But you see me now
Aaah, you see me now

// A Layover //

Yeah
Find a plug we in town for the night
5 am flight, despite
We make them bring an ounce
Hotel trying to kick us out
'Cause the flower tend to bring the noise
Silver spoon, I don't need no clout
I just let that nigga hit the joint
Took my last drag, you can have it back
[*cough*]
Hop in the Uber, I'm in customs in 30
They held me back, I had a water in my bag, its just a habit, brah
Won't you let me through this motherfucka
5 flights this week, I do this motherfucka
First class, got 'em looking like, "Who this motherfucka?"
I lightly say drummer before rapper
I like to say writer before both
They won't give me my respect
Its more smoke they request
It must be
Covertly concealed and stuffed deep
Pack in my napshack, she think I"m musty
Told my girl, she think I'm lucky
I'm overseas in alternative traps
While these niggas quote alternative facts
I rarely watch the news
Still watching niggas like a fucking hawk
They judging my steps they don't know my walk
Hopscotch ain't the only chalk we seen on South Side pavements
Outline resemble Keith Haring's imagination
I'm off of Cottage Grove and we just landed out in Charles de Gaulle
The driver hit me with the "enchante"
I think he know we eating good like them small ass plates
If it sound like hate, don't bring it my way
We 7 hours ahead, nigga all y'all late
How you have the mask on nigga all y'all fake
The driver hit me with the "enchante"
I think he know we eating good like them small ass plates
If it sound like hate, don't bring it my way
We 7 hours ahead, nigga all y'all late
We 7 hours ahead, nigga all y'all late

// Gucci Bag //

"... Dividing and conquer, not stop
So easy for us to love each other 'cause we so fucking fly
Look at our skin, this shit is golden red, black, chocolate
Our hearts is made of diamonds and-
And we treat ourselves like motherfu... like like we can't see that, man."

Uh, funky flowers in my Gucci bag
Lowkey balling like a Boosie fade
And I'm pulling up like Melo, red and yellow
Kill a fellow, watch for snakes, they don't take a break
We don't need no sleep, we been sleep, need to stay awake
Stay alert, we just play aloof 'til I'm Beowulf
Bayonet, I don't gotta shoot, all my shit is sharp
Get some flint, I do more than sparks with the penmanship
I be on that art over censorship
Niggas need Sensidyne to hold the truth within they lips
Making love when they kiss their teeth
Just bring the same energy that you had on the internet
False flagging, I ain't into that
I'm in the paint like Rembrandt
Where your sinners at?
Where you eating dinner at?
We'll infiltrate, you imitate
We innovate, we in the field
We Holyfield, we here you biting, now you Hollywood
And I'm just getting high and writing, I got

[Mick Jenkins & Michael Anthony:]
Uh, funky flowers in my Gucci bag
Lowkey balling like a Boosie fade
And I'm pulling up like Melo
Niggas egos give me chills
I [?] that bitch and [?]
My song ain't worth no 100 mil
Look boy, I do this shit for real
You know how that feel

Yeah, I don't need a cosign, I'm in my own tangent
Seeing all the angles, working through semantics
Got niggas frantic
They want me down with dog, I've been praying mantis
Look, we ain't flipping yola, we just doing yoga
Stretching while you stressing out about your wallet
Step my training up to hyperbolic
Chambers got my brain on brolic
So I wanna block the knowledge
'Cause they know that shit could spread like Bubonic
Shift the plate, tectonics, 'cause a sonic boom
From the tonic room, shake the seismic charts
This shit art, this shit part Red Seas, talked to burning bushes
Had to learn to keep pushing, fuck how niggas looking
I've been out her burning kushes, I got

Uh, funky flowers in my Gucci bag
Lowkey balling like a Boosie fade
And I'm pulling up like Melo
Uh, funky flowers in my Gucci bag
Lowkey balling like a Boosie fade
And I'm pulling up like Melo
Niggas egos give me chills
I [?] that bitch and [?]
My song ain't worth no 100 mil
Look boy, I do this shit for real
You know how that feel?

// Vampire In Brooklyn //

I was nodding my head to your style 'fore you took your first breaths
You still taking your very first steps with this rap shit
I'm past that
I'm out in traffic, exchange the paper for the plastic
We needed some Glad Wrap for the bodies I'ma lay down
I be with playwrights, nah we don't play 'round
Where we hear action, improv niggas all up in my faction
And we don't know no fiction, only facts
Whole numbers, we ain't doing fractions
You niggas capping
What you pillage? You know Cappadonna?
Claim pimp, you jump ship if a mac was on ya
Talking loud, we can't smell no pack on you, I do not believe it
Chest out, but you dry heaving
And you couldn't even try leaving
Bite marks on your neck
Sucking dick for respect
You would flip for a check
I ain't never fucked with Jesse White
Politicians is politicians
My nigga, miss me with the politicking

Scoop up a nigga 'fore he learn the ropes
Take from that nigga when he look away
Working real hard, he gon' earn his broke
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
Take from that nigga when he look away
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way

Flipping shit like spatulas
I'm talking six months in 'fore I knew I was fucking with Dracula
Immediately withdrawn
I watched them niggas you pissed on
Two weeks prior was kissing they ass
Couldn't even tolerate you twisting the grass
Hit it and dash
Like, if it ain't the gas, I'ma blast, my g
Stay in a cut 'til it's a gash, my g
From out south, done seen whole lot of blood, like my ass YG
Guard down, dodging blows Ali-esque
Tryna' drop the waters, I'm just getting my feet wet with the business
Who knew I'd be in bed with the snakes
Taking off, and I'm already on my breaks
Ain't seen no cake yet with chains on
They tell me that that's just the brakes
So I copped a chainsaw
I'm on my Leatherface now
Like, fuck your pepper spray
I do it way too fly for featherweights
And almost Kyrie'd when I hesitate
Know this shit gon' resonate
I just put my ten in a collection plate and pray about it
It really ain't much else to say about it
I'm on my drug dealer chic
Moms got the pocket rocket
I just copped a old school to roll through the streets
Now I'm plotting on 26 acres, fuck a lease
Tryna' raise a pack of dogs, fuck a leash
I be with my bitch, she be on her shit
And she keep me on mines
I don't own no watch to keep me on time
Know exactly where I'm supposed to be
I know exactly who this close to me
I know my wrist is exact
Fuck a list, even when I'm doing grocery shopping
Crisco flow boy, I'm supposed to be popping
And damn near wavy as the ocean be

// FreeNation Rebels //

Free, free, free
Free, free, free
Free nation rebels
Free nation rebels

Ay, free 'cause I don't do this for no dollar
But they know I get paid though
And I put interest on the peso
Business manager on speed dial, that nigga do my say-so
My tithes faithful
The pride come before the fall, I ain't tripped in a while
Developed a gap, already gifted with God
I found the key, I'm on a kite, I get these Benjamins now
A flash of light and niggas interested now
The fans, they fuck with me like they can't see how dark my pigment is now
A bunch of white boys tripping out, screaming "nigga" at me
They trigger happy
My figures happy, the venue happy, the show is sold out
They lining up and load in
I give them less of what they want and more what they need
My mama used to think that it was only weed I rapped about
I capped a lot at first, but that didn't last too long
No, that didn't last two songs before I folded like futons
I'm on my croutons, I'm on my Groupons
Like shoutout, say money with no coupons
I brought the coupe out
I brought the tree, I brought the truth out
I brought the waters, I brought the love and niggas had me tuned out
Trump brought the coons out
I had to pull that silver spoon out
The moon out
I'm with the wolves, I can't pull my wool out
Black sheep, I've been on my TLC
Niggas jock so I creep
I'll come and tuck you in if you sleep

We some free nation rebels
Free nation rebels

Tasted the free, now she want some more
We was out in front of the corner store
On some '09 shit, they was blowing dro
Don't act like you don't know
We some free nation rebels
Free nation rebels

// Energies //

"That energy and that vibration shit is like, really real. Shit is really really real, know what I'm saying? Contagious in the whole thing. So we have to have an intent when we come to the studio, to be in this right frame of mind..."

[Mick Jenkins:]
All of this mercy on me, I've been trying to pray for my enemy
Hearing your words, and I mean I ignore your energy (energy)
I am not God, ain't judging unless you come get at me
But you be for sure, I am not gonna ignore your energy
Your energy, we feel your vibe (feel your vibe)
We feel the lows, we feel the highs (feel the highs)
And when it's off (when it's off), we feel that too (I feel that too)
We feel that too (I feel that too), we feel that too (I feel that too)

[Saba:]
Uh, this is not a myth or a sitcom
Stand up, sit down
Hold my chair like a bar mitzvah
Even though I'm 6'1"
I don't wanna kick it with them kick rocks
Yelling in the mic, I'm hella pissed off
Even had clip it like I'm Chris Paul
They forgot about him like dementia
I'ma leader, I got 'em like a mentor
Ignore energy, they're all finicky
So little of this shit is important to me
It's so interesting
How many nigga my bro now
But they ain't no kin to me
And cousins out the woodwork
It's like a rat race, who's out the hood first
Niggas fictitious
Causing friction
I do not do inertia
But I read the vibes
Like I play the xylophone and my solo coming
And I read the vibes
Even as a kid when had to ask for company over
Keep a compass on me 'cause I know we heading now and death is around the corner
Family ties
Cut down in your [?] and now you part like [?]

[Mick Jenkins:]
All of this mercy on me, I've been trying to pray for my enemy
Hearing your words, and I mean I ignore your energy (energy)
I am not God, ain't judging unless you come get at me
But you be for sure, I am not gonna ignore your energy
Your energy, we feel your vibe (feel your vibe)
We feel the lows, we feel the highs (feel the highs)
And when it's off (when it's off), we feel that too (I feel that too)
We feel that too (I feel that too), we feel that too (I feel that too)

We feel that like
Touching the wall for the light in the dark
I've been finding a spark in the spaces
Apart for where niggas been hating
I'm starting to face all the music
Amusing to think I was bitter for energy
That was confusing and using me
That's just abusive, I'm used to it though
Niggas intruded, I treated 'em like, thieves in the night
Hip to the fraud, since Midnight Marauder
Rock of Gibraltar, sipping this mineral water
I don't do vodka, funny, I'm back on my pinnacle
Allergic to bullshit, I keep me a Benadryl
You down to face Pollen when you in the field
Hope negative feelings get intercepted
'Fore they turn into projections
You intellect isn't enough to protect you
They'll disrespect you, just to misdirect you
Had me missing lessons, had me missing blessings
Had me stressing
Now my little light is incandescent
Now a nigga skin is iridescent
You can't get this glow with acquiescence
I ain't been there since an adolescent
I been asking questions

All of this mercy on me, I've been trying to pray for my enemy
Hearing your words, and I mean I ignore your energy (energy)
I am not God, ain't judging unless you come get at me
But you be for sure, I am not gonna ignore your energy
Your energy, we feel your vibe (feel your vibe)
We feel the lows, we feel the highs (feel the highs)
And when it's off (when it's off), we feel that too (I feel that too)
