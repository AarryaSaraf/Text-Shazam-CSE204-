// Never You Change //

Let me hear you again, now, oh baby, sir

Sweetheart, darling, bear in mind all the time
That a constant friend is hard to find, find
But when you find one that is good and kind, oh

Never you change, never you change
Old for new, oh darling
Never you change, never you change
Old for new

Because I love you, is that I want you to know
That I really, really, really love you so
So, so, so, darling, you remember when we both were small
I never fall in love before, but it's you my heart is aching for

Ooh, ooh, my people
Just keep on, darling, bear in mind all the time
That a constant friend is hard to find, find
But when you find one that is good and kind

Never you change, never you change
Old for new, oh darling, please never you change
Never you change
Old for new, oh darling, never, never
Never you change
Old for new, oh darling

// So Bad //

Aye, aye, aye, aye, yeah

They say you don't love me
But I know, yeah
I know you really love me
Listen

But you don't love me like I love you
You don't need me
Like I need you so bad

The way you treat me, you control me
The way you love me
Lord, you make me cry

I've tried my best to keep you
All the way through
But if you're still feeling blue, baby
Come to me, I'll come to you

To keep you satisfied, yeah
But baby, if you still want more from me
Call on me, I'll give you more, I'll try

Do you really love me, I love you too
But deep down inside of me, yeah, yeah
You know I really want you

Aye, aye, aye, aye
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Um hum

Good girl you're feeling me down
Is that how you?
With the rhythm of your heart, look down on me
Yeah, I've got your love

Aye, aye, aye, aye, yeah, yeah
Yeah, hey, hey

// Living In The Ghetto //

Some of the rich men get their riches from the ghetto
As far as I can see
All the poor ones, that live in the ghetto
They put all their trust in vanity
And that's why, the rich ones shall be richer
And the poor ones shall be poorer

That's how it goes, that's where it's at

You must first see the kingdom of Zion
Then all things will be hurried unto you
You will never want, hungering or thirsting
You will feed off this cup of life

And then you will weep no more
Know that it's God and God and God alone

That set us free from our misery
Really set us free

You sick with your soul brother
You sick with your soul sister
I say, you wrong with my God
It's not my God, wrong with you

You sick with your soul brother
You sick with your love sister
I say, you wrong with my God
It's not my God, wrong with you

You must first sit in the kingdom of Zion
Then all things, will be hurried unto you
You will never want, hungering or thirsting
You will feed off this cup of life

And then you will know yourself
And know that it's love and purity, that set us free
That set us free from all this misery

Hey! I'm from the ghetto
People living in the ghetto
Let me sing it to you
Can you hear what I say?

That's how it goes
As far as I can see
