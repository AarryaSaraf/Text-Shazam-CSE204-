// In The Morning //

In the morning
Feeling half-right
If it was more than just one day
I'd feel alright

Today is flat beneath the weight
Of next day, next day, next day, next day
Next day, next day, next day, next day

In the morning
Feeling half-right
Ignore my condition
Just an isolated incident

In the morning
Feeling half-right
Appearing normal
Another isolated incident

When my mind's uncertain my body decides
What it will do to get through the hell of the night
As I trip on the ocean that leads through your eyes
Well my eyes can't wait till they finally see through you

When I get this feeling like I'm gonna start
I just have to stop

// Reasons //

Come through me
You arrive and I'm on fire
Subdue me
To explode that you inspired

So groovily
Second episode of all smiles
Let's make a movie
In the name of all great liars

Improvising, Kaufman style

They are all reasons to me
They are all reasons to be
They are all reasons to see
They are all reasons to me

How the hell do you do this?
Change the colors, shapes, and size
I'm clueless
Not one thing I recognize, so foolish

Every now's a big surprise
Help me to get through this
Stay with me until I die
There's nothing else i wanna try

They are all reasons to me
They are all reasons to be
They are all reasons to see
They are all reasons to me

They are all reasons to me
They are all reasons to be
They are all reasons to see
They are all reasons to me

// Big Dipper //

Once...

When I was little someone pointed out to me
Some constellations but the big dipper's all I could see
That brontasaurus must have stood a thousand miles high
That brontasaurus laying on its side up in the sky

Bottoms up and this time, won't you let me be?
Bottled up but this time, won't you rescue me?
You should have been here last night
And heard what the big dipper said to me

Jack thought it twice and thought that that had made it true
Some brains just work that way, that's what chemicals can do
He thought he'd have a beer, he thought he was alone
He thought an Albertson's stir fry dinner would make his apartment a home

Bottoms up and this time, won't you let me be?
Bottled up but this time, won't you rescue me?
You should have been here last night
And heard what the big dipper said to me

I thought I bored me but I learned to think like you
Now nothing bores me that's that nothing is thought through

Bottoms up and this time, won't you let me be?
Bottled up but this time, won't you rescue me?
Thought it out and this time it's all I can see
You should have been here last night
And heard what the big dipper said

// Fling //

Since my fling with you, time went from
Popping off three times a day to popping off three times a week
And it takes me a long time
To come to the memory of us

One week later there's melody
Doing what I always waited for
And I didn't stop her
But I didn't lead her on

// Cleo //

Wiggly days, wiggly nights
When it's dark bring in light so you can see
What a sound, straight through my spine bounced off of me
Makes me round, 3-D sound, push it down, move it around

See, I'm fine

Ain't it strange that I can dream?
You can say it's night or day
Snow or rain it's all the same
When there's nothing I have ever seen
In here, in here

Ain't it strange that I can dream?
You can say it's night or day
Snow or rain it's all the same
Ain't it strange that I have brain activity?
In here, in here

Who brought those cameras in?
Who gave who the right?
Lennart Nilsson, shut off those lights
Inside a sea turned from frog to freak to tiny red and meek

Ain't it strange that I can dream?
You can say it's night or day
Snow or rain it's all the same
Strange that I'm a human being

Ain't it strange that I can dream?
You can say it's night or day
Snow or rain it's all the same

Living in the womb
Running out of room
Have to come out soon
Have to meet the sun and moon and

// The Source //

Morning comes and I'm up on time again
Upon getting up I'm down on what I got up for
Boring, dumb, and fine
It's been a long time, my friend

And you haven't changed, neither have I
So why you wanna bring that up?
I feel it started at the source

What is it that makes you cry and why?
What is it that makes you cry and why?

When you see a documentary and know the outcome and that it's fucked
You still hope Hitler will blow up
And that Kennedy will duck

I feel it starting at the source

What is it that makes you cry and why?
What is it that makes you cry and why?
What is it that makes you cry and why?
What is it that makes you cry and why?

// Twin Falls //

Christmas, Twin Falls, Idaho
Is her oldest memory
She was only two
It's the first time she felt blue

Cafeteria, Harrison
Elementary
Beneath a parachute
I saw her without shoes

7 up, I touched her thumb
And she knew it was me
Although she couldn't see
Unless of course she peeked

My mom's good, she got me out of
Twin Falls, Idaho
Before I got too old
You know how that goes

That's where she still was the summer
She turned 17
In 1983
Three weeks after me

Last I heard was she had twins
Or maybe it was three
Although I've never seen
But that don't bother me

// Distopian Dream Girl //

Can you make it real?
Make it more than real, more than just feel
We are on a ride
We're on it all the time to the front of your mind

My stepfather looks
Just like David Bowie but he hates David Bowie
I think Bowie's cool
I think Lodger rules, my stepdad's a fool

Without me there's nothing
I'm the only thing that dies
If it came down to your life or mine
I would do the stupid thing

And let you keep on living
And let you keep on living
And let you keep on living
And let you keep on living

"I'm alright," said the man to his wife
Waking up to a head full of bed, full of what she said
She hadn't thought of it for a while
And when she did, she thought of it differently than she thought she should be thinking

Just the thought of it's enough
To penetrate my comfort zone

Without me there's nothing
I'm the only thing that dies
If it came down to your life or mine
I would do the stupid thing

And let you keep on living
And let you keep on living
And let you keep on living
And let you keep on living

// Israel's Song //

A boy becomes normal today
Finally breaks away
Into freshness and understanding
He pushed the world he knew

Will the world break him back?
Will someone snap him in half?
And build back the glass
Or is it just the boy now?

// Stab //

Make it a time, make it anytime
Make sure that it's not the only kind that others find
I've got a mind, I've got half a mind
To shut down the whole system at the spine with fishing line

I'm really glad there's a grasp to grab
It's only a stab in a wet paper bag, is that so bad?

I wrote a song, it was slow and long
I wrote the words and the music wrong but life goes on
And on and on and on and on and on and on
