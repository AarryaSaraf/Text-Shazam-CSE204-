Album: SunGiant

// Sun Giant //

What a life I lead in the summer
What a life I lead in the spring
What a life I lead when the wind, it breathes
What a life I lead in the spring

What a life I lead when the sun breaks free
As a giant torn from the clouds
What a life indeed when that ancient seed
Is a-buried, watered and plowed

What a life
What a life
What a life
What a life

What a life I lead in the summer
What a life I lead in the spring
What a life I lead when the wind, it breathes
What a life I lead in the spring

// Drops In The River //

Crown of leaves, high in the window on a gold morning
Young today, old as a railroad tomorrow
Days are just drops in the river to be lost always
Only you, only you, you know

Years ago, birds of a feather would arrive nightly
Gone you know, held to another like clutched ivy
On the shore, speak to the ocean and receive silence
Only you, only you, you know

You hesitate, so my memory fades
I'll hold to the first one
"I wouldn't turn to another," you say
On the long night we've made

Let it go

Only you, only you, you know
Only you, only you, you know

You hesitate, so my memory fades
I'll hold to the first one
"I wouldn't turn to another," you say
On the long night we've made

Let it go
Let it go

Speak to me slow, my dear
No ghost, of course, in here
Pleased to be lonesome, quiet and clear
All is alone in here

// English House //

You go with your two feet bare
Down through the cold lane there to Brighton
A country house, a liar and a louse live there

And go with your arms held wide
Happiness in your eyes, come and sit
And stay the night, turn out every light you see
And lay them down, buried in the ground for me

Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love

The tongues of the creatures wait
Drawn to the fragile legs you walk on
A cold wind blows, Brighton to the coast for me
A cold wind blows, Brighton to the coast for me

Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love

Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love

// Mykonos //

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

The door slammed loud and rose up a cloud of dust on us
Footsteps follow, down through the hollow sound, torn up

And you will go to Mykonos
With a vision of a gentle coast
And a sun to maybe dissipate
Shadows of the mess you made

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Pallid animals in the snow-tipped pines, I find
Hatching from the seed of your orphaned mind, all night

And you will go to Mykonos
With a vision of a gentle coast
And a sun to maybe dissipate
Shadows of the mess you made

Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Brother, you don't need to turn me away
I was waiting down at the ancient gate
You go wherever you go today
You go today

I remember how they took you down
As the winter turned the meadow brown
You go wherever you go today
You go today

When out walking, brother, don't you forget
It ain't often that you'll ever find a friend

You go wherever you go today
You go today
You go wherever you go today
You go today
You go wherever you go today
You go today
You go wherever you go today
You go today
You go wherever you go today
You go today
You go wherever you go today
You go today
You go wherever you go today
You go today

// Innocent Son //

You left me there
Waiting at the bottom of the stairs
With my eyes closed
Holding my right hand in my left

There is no time for
Hesitation now
You come or go
Or go

Rust suddenly falling beside me
On a ghost of a morning 
Riding in sorrow to the harbor 

Far behind, oh me
The bodies of my friends
Hanging alone
Alone again

Some twisted thorn
Tells me you saw me in the night with another
Keep all my promises to break them

I am no, oh no
Innocent son
You run
Rabbit run
