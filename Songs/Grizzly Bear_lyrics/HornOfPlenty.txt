// Deep Sea Diver //

I'm a deep sea diver with my fins
and underneath your current I do swim
a baker's dozen pertty pearls
and where I travel on my toes do curl
cause you, you got everthing that I want
a car, a house, and a dog
you got everything that I want

Just keep me a while
Just keep me a while
Just keep me a while
Just keep me a while

I'm a deep sea diver losing air
and around here I'm sad swimming
you don't care

// Don't Ask //

It's a call
I fell into your arms that night
Don't ask
It's the time we had apart to sort things out
Just don't ask
It's the work you saying you're doing
But baby, I don't even ask
It's the love that came undone between us
and nobody ever asks
There's a place and time for everything I know
Don't ask
But when I'm around you still I lose control
Just don't ask
You suggest the struggle goes both ways
but baby, I don't even ask
I just wish you had a little faith
but I'm learning not to ask

// Alligator //

It's a fear. It is near. The shape becomes ever clear.
It bares teeth extra sharp that'll cut you in the heart.
It attacks really quick, try and fight it with a stick.
There's no use, give it up, this is life and this is love.

You are my alligator.
You are my alligator

// Campfire //

You made a campfire, I put it out, I put it out
Let the long johns, fall down
Around your ankles and your toes
I know what I want to see
Lay there by the fire
By the fire
By the fire

There's a touch of you I think I can see (repeats)
By, the campfire...

// Shift //

Baby, I've got silver and I've got gold
But when push comes to shove, this is getting old
I wouldn't have it any other way
No, I wouldn't have it any other way
And when you call I'll be there
There...
I wouldn't have it any other way

// Disappearing Act //

My lord, the devil carried off my donkey
Deeply, affected by the girl's beauty
Sleeping, dew on the meadows I'm dreaming
This is everything I see
Flight

Nightfall, sundrise is already upon us
Searching, the palace is our only harbor
I have begun to see just what the dream means
And it's everything
Inside

We have seen the end and it's coming
The cave did lead us clearly to something
It is the time to rest our heads downward
To end this quest
Now

// Fix It //

My chest hurts a lot tonight
Maybe you can fix that
My chest hurts a lot tonight

I fell on a car again
Maybe you can fix that
I fell on a car again

And when I walk on by, I see you waving

Nothing ever feels the same
Maybe you can fix that
Nothing ever feels the same

Cum again all over me
I swear Iâll change just wait and see
And if I donât please make amends
With everything we had again

I swear it was just a game
I have to fix that
I swear it was just a game

Cum again all over me
I swear Iâll change just wait and see
And if I donât please make amends
With everything we had again

Just fix it for me
Just fix it for me
Just fix it for me

// Merge //

Stuck
On the fence with you
This I'm always prone to do

Forge something new
And leave it all behind with you

And leave it all behind with you

Back at the front of the lane
I see all those boys again
I shift through you

And leave it all behind, it's true
And leave it all behind, it's true

// A Good Place //

I woke up understated
A simple feeling, aimed at you
And my love's gone underrated
A simple feeling, aimed at you
And it took me ages to figure out what I was supposed to know
All the sordid details of your final blow by blow

This is a hymn for you, this is a song for you

// Showcase //

When I came to you I, saw a light of understanding
Maybe, you are only, left with that tree
That tree

Bum, bum, bum, bum

Ooooh
I have, a lot of things to
Share with you
You

Tonight, tonight, haaaaaight, aaaahhh, haaaaaaaa, aaaa

When you, were the showcase
There was action, all over me
Now that, we are backstage
There's a lot, a looooot, a loooot of things to referee
To referee
To referee
Referee

// La Duchess Anne //

The war broke out, and I dropped my camera
Causing the flash to jam
The leopard print, at La Duchess Anne
The fat ten-year old, we had
Serve us dinner, at the cafÃ© downstairs
The TV was on, we got lots of cold glares

Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo

Even the sex couldn't make up for all the rest
And when we opted to fuck, over watching
Filtered smut on the TV set
I realized I've had it so good

Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo

And after all the mess I've made this far
I broke the latch inside your favorite, favorite car
And now you have to crawl across the passenger's seat
(just to get out)
Don't you realize, how good you've had it?
How good I've had it?
How good you've had it?

// Eavesdropping //

I saw you leave the house last night
You rounded the bend and came across the porch and stood tall
And I've reason to believe
That you were eavesdropping on me
That you were eavesdropping on me
On me
On me
On me

// Service Bell //

I keep a service bell by my bed for you
Let the others do what they do
I will hold on
Hold on
Hold on

I keep a service bell by my bed for you

// This Song //

Its amazing
All the things you said about us
Its amazing
And true
And its amazing
That I can still sing this song
So simply about you
Because after all
It is just one of those things
Because after all
It is just one of those things
And its amazing
How I can still sing this song
So simply about you
