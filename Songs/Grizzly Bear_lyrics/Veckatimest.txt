// Southern Point //

Our haven on the southern point is calling us
Our haven on the southern point is calling us
And faced with all the obvious, sheâll carry us
Avert your eyes from all of this, weâll make it all back

In the end, youâll never find
Youâll never find me now
But Iâll return to you
When you return to me

In the end, youâll never find
Youâll never find me now
But Iâll return to you
When you return to me

In regards to the last word
Itâs not the last youâll hear
Iâd never find any other
I could ever, I could ever

Never say itâs the last one
Itâs not the last one
Iâd never find any other
I could ever, I could ever

// Two Weeks //

Save up all the days
A routine malaise
Just like yesterday
I told you I would stay

Would you always?
Maybe sometimes?
Make it easy?
Take your time

Think of all the ways
Momentary phase
Just like yesterday
I told you I would stay

Every time you try
Quarter half a mile
Just like yesterday
I told you I would stay

Would you always?
Maybe sometimes?
Make it easy?
Take your time

Would you always?
Maybe sometimes?
Make it easy?
Take your time

Always
Sometimes
Easy
Time

// All We Ask //

In this old house, I'm not alone
In a bedroom, a telephone
You made the call and I just stood by
I stripped the sheets and emptied out the sty

And the crowds, they light the carnival
Calling us, calling us
And all they want, another voice
To lead us on, lead us on, lead us on

Even wasting the time with you
Doesn't matter if I think it through
You took the car around the bend
And ran it in the ground, letâs pretend

And the crowds, they light the carnival
Calling us, calling us
And all we ask, another voice
To lead us on, lead us on, lead us on

I can't get out of what I'm into with you
I can't get out of what I'm into with you
I can't get out of what I'm into with you
I can't get out of what I'm into with you

// Fine For Now //

There was time, it took time
All the while
There is time, so much time
There is time, so much time

All the kids on the waterfront
Try to raise their hands
Not asking for your permission
Please understand

If weâre all faltering, howâd I help with that?
If itâs all or nothing, then let me go
If weâre all faltering, whyâd I help with that?
If itâs all or nothing, then let me go

There was time, it took time
All the while
There is time, so much time
There is time, so much time

All the kids on the waterfront
Try to raise their hands
Not asking for your permission
Please understand

If weâre all faltering, howâd I help with that?
If itâs all or nothing, then let me go
If weâre all faltering, howâd I help with that?
If itâs all or nothing, then let me go

// Cheerleader //

Mention a name we know, we know
Appear tame, it shows, shows
Please don't feign the ropes
Always the same, I know

I'm shooting them myself
I should've made it matter
I'm shooting them myself
I should've made it matter

God let it go, I'm shooting them myself
It doesn't mean a thing, I should've made it matter
Chance and sow, I'm shooting them myself
Nothing changing, I should've made it matter

There's no time to go
Through the designs we know
Never mind, although
Maybe this time, we'll grow

I'm shooting them myself
I should've made it matter
I'm shooting them myself
I should've made it matter

God let it go, I'm shooting them myself
It doesn't mean a thing, I should've made it matter
Chance and sow, I'm shooting them myself
Nothing changing, I should've made it matter

God let it go, I'm shooting them myself
It doesn't mean a thing, I should've made it matter
Chance and sow, I'm shooting them myself
Nothing changing, I should've made it matter

// Dory //

Wildly coherent in a watery deep
Weâll drop her down to the bottom
Weâll drop her down like sheâs nothing
And the water is all

Oh, the water is still in a wilder deep
Weâll swim around like two dories
Weâll swim around like two dories
Let loose in the bay

Weâll miss the eddy
Hold on, make steady, go
There is no plenty
Even keel already, go

I canât be here all hours
Oh, such a riot
I canât discern this trouble
Oh, what a riot

I canât be here all hours
Oh, such a riot
I canât describe

I canât be here all hours
Oh, such a riot
I canât describe this problem
Oh, what a riot

I canât be here all hours
Oh, such a riot
I canât describe this problem

// Ready, Able //

I'm going to take a stab at this
Surely we'll be alright 
Make a decision with a kiss
Maybe I have frostbite

And when I shuffled on back home
I made sure all of my tracks in the snow
Were gone

Tissue and bones it was a tryst
This isn't a gunfight
Checking it off of my list
Unable to rewrite

Five years, countless months and a loan
Hope I'm ready, able to make my own
Good home

They go we go, I want you to know, what I did I did
They go we go, I want you to know, what I did I did

They go we go, I want you to know, what I did I did
They go we go, I want you to know, what I did I did

They go we go, I want you to know, what I did I did
They go we go, I want you to know, what I did I did

// About Face //

Without a trace, makes me wonder
A staged race has no thunder
This is the case of our blunder

Itâs a fire
For what?
Time for faith
We thought

About face, makes me wonder
And in case, there is no thunder
A bit of grace in our blunder

Itâs a fire
For what?
Time for faith
We thought

Itâs a fire
For what? For what?
Time for faith
We thought

Itâs a fire
For what? For what?
Time for faith
We thought

// Hold Still //

Here we go again
Weâll carry on, my only friends
Iâll take one chance without compromise
There isnât anything left to try

Here we go again
Weâll carry on, but then again
We couldnât take this on, the story goes unformed
As if we never were there at all

// While You Wait For The Others //

While you wait for the others
To make it all worthwhile
All your useless pretentions
Are weighing on my time

You could beg for forgiveness
As long as you like
Or just wait out the evening
You'll only leave me dry

Yes, you'll only leave me dry

So I'll ask you kindly to make your way
And what was there?
The perfect glare
We all fall through

While you wait on the answers
That I'll pretend to find
Keeping up with emotions
Still occupies our time

You could hope for some substance
As long as you like
Or just wait out the evening
And always ask me why

Yes, you'll only leave me dry

So I'll ask you kindly to make your way
And what was left?
The perfect glare
We all fall through

And all we want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want
Want, want, want, want, want, want
Want, want, want, want
Want, want, want

And what was there?
And what was there?
And what wasn't there?

// I Live With You //

Return
Been gone too long
Return
Don't make me beg

And theyâll try
They'll try
Theyâll try
To keep us apart

And theyâll try, theyâll try
They'll try
To keep us apart
But yes we can

You brought us this far
Weâll do what we can

Return
Donât put me on
Return
Donât make me beg

Return

And theyâll try
Theyâll try
Theyâll try
To keep us apart

And youâll try, you all try
Youâll try
To keep us apart
But yes we can

You brought us this far
Weâll do what we can

// Foreground //

Take on another shift
Palms in the middle, hands in the middle
Work out another rift
Something is muffled, another chuckle

This is a foreground
It is a foreground

A cross country miss
Take direction, canât connect it
Iâm afraid this is
Ten detected, nine in a wreck and

A little jetty fight
Pattern evolving, motion insolvent
Something about this might
Take all evening, Iâll just be cleaning

This is a foreground
It is a foreground
