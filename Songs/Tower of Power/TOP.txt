// Soul With A Capital 'S' //

There's all kinds of music
Everywhere you go
Some folks like it fast
Some like it slow
Some like it hot
Some like it blue
Some like it old
And some like it new

Now I'm not knockin' country
And I'm not rappin' rap
Big band swing just ain't my thing
Alternative ain't my snap

The only thing that turns me on
Is when I hear a soulful song

I like soul with a capital 'S'
Soul with a capital 'S'
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul, with a capital 'S'

Music makes you happy
Or it can make you sad
It can turn the worst day
To the best you ever had
For entertainment value
If I had to choose
You and me might disagree
'Cause I like rhythm and blues

Now I'm not dissin' disco
Not sayin' punk is bunk
I can't settle for heavy metal
'Cause I gotta have that funk

The only thing that turns me on
Is when I hear a soulful song

I like soul with a capital 'S'
Soul with a capital 'S'
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul, with a capital 'S'

There's people who tell you
To get with the times
It doesn't even matter
If your poem rhymes
But I'm here to tell you
Whatever comes along
There's something here for everyone
There ain't no right or wrong

If soft rock makes you lazy
Classical leaves you flat
And fusion drives you crazy
Then snap funk is where it's at

The only thing that turns me on
Is when I hear a soulful song

I like soul with a capital 'S'
Soul with a capital 'S'
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul, with a capital 'S'

I like soul! With a capital 'S'
Soul with a capital 'S'
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul, with a capital 'S'

With a capital 'S'
With a capital 'S'
With a capital 'S'
With a capital 'S'

Oh, I like soul
(With a capital 'S')
Oh, don't ya know I like soul
(With a capital 'S')
You gotta gimme some of that soul, ha
(With a capital 'S')
Yes, I like soul
(With a capital 'S')

With a capital 'S'
With a capital 'S'
With a capital 'S'
With a capital 'S'

Hey yea...

Yo fellas
Sounds like some of that Oakland soul music
You know what I'm talking about?

(They done found the stroke
Done found the Oakland stroke
They done found the stroke
Done found the Oakland stroke)

(Soul, with a capital 'S')
Gimme some of that soul
(With a capital 'S')
Got to have that soul
(With a capital 'S')
(With a capital 'S')
That's what I like
(With a capital 'S')
Sweet soul music
(With a capital 'S')

// It All Comes Back //

You may win, you may lose, no matter what the choice, you gonna have to choose
Keepin' up with the Jones's, is not a wise course
You gotta build your own road, tell the man to join
Hmm, it's all so simple, HA, it really is
It's a well known fact y'all, that what you put out is what you get

Give it up, put it out, add it up, double it, it all comes back

Got a problem, put a damper on your day
Confusion all around, you can't find your way
Ooh funky words fallin' from your mouth
It's like a lot of excuses, you're just lyin' to yourself
WAKE UP, life's too short
Such a silly game, only thing you win is a crying shame

Give it up, put it out, add it up, double it, it all comes back
Give it up, put it out, add it up, double it, it all comes back

So many people, so many try, to hide what they feel inside
I won't play that game, I must admit I tried
I'd rather die now, than live the lie

Give it up, put it out, add it up, double it, it all comes back
Give it up, put it out, add it up, double it, it all comes back

// Please Come Back (To Stay) //

All those people
It's just not the same
But all things considered
I was to blame
Since I insisted, on playing my game
You walked out
Walked right out of my life

Love, just let me hold you
Another day
I don't need to control you
Have it your way
I just want to love you
What more can I say
Darling, please come back to stay

I never suspected
I'd feel so alone
With things in perspective
I should have known
Somehow I got here
All on my own
You walked out
Walked right out of my life

Love, just let me hold you
Another day
I don't need to control you
Have it your way
I just want to love you
What more can I say
Darling, please come back
Darling, please come back to stay

Let me love you the rest of my days
Oh, baby, come what may, ah

Love, just let me hold you
Another day
I don't need to control you
Have it your way
I just want to love you
What more can I say
Darling, please come back to stay

Yeah yeah, please come back to stay
Yeah... (please come back, please come back) come back, baby
Please come back to stay, baby

Come back to stay baby, yeah yeah
Please, please, come back to stay
Just let me love you
Oh, I just wanna hold you baby
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

// The Real Deal //

How can I convince you it's the real deal baby
Make you realize that you're the one
How can I convince you it's the real deal baby
It's the real deal, you're the one

Should I stand on my head?
Do a little dance?
Are you lookin' for some comfort or a sizzlin' romance?
Should jump through some hoops?
Tell some funny jokes?
Or send a dozen roses to impress your folks

Tell what it is you want me to do
I'll do anything that you want me to

How can I convince you it's the real deal baby
Make you realize that you're the one
How can I convince you it's the real deal baby
It's the real deal, you're the one

Should I act part the fool?
Sweep you off your feet?
Turn the temperature up
And make you feel the heat
Should I make with the charm?
Be suave and debonair?
[?] Michael Jackson
You can call me Pi√©r

Tell what it is that you want me to do
I'll do anything that you want me to

How can I convince you it's the real deal baby
Make you realize that you're the one
How can I convince you it's the real deal baby
It's the real deal, you're the one
It's the real deal baby
It's the real deal baby
It's the real deal, you're the one

Should I act some kind of misfit
In a 1000 dollar suit
If I have to be sentimental
Would you find me cute?
Should I wine and dine your daughter
With Champagne and Caviar
Just to let you know
How important you are

Tell what it is you want me to do
I'll do anything that you want me to

How can I convince you it's the real deal baby
Make you realize that you're the one
How can I convince you it's the real deal baby
It's the real deal, you're the one
How can I convince you it's the real deal baby
Make you realize that you're the one
How can I convince you it's the real deal baby
It's the real deal, you're the one
It's the real deal baby
It's the real deal baby
It's the real deal, you're the one

// Come To A Decision //

You want it your way, I want it mine
It's gonna take both of us to try
Put it back together
It's better late than never
We can make it work out right this time

Saying you love me isn't easy
'Cause everything I do is far from pleasing
Allow me to apologize
Before you wanna say goodbye
Try to understand
There's a reason

We've got to come to a decision
Right away
'Cause tomorrow is too late to start again
We've got to come to a decision
Find a way
'Cause if another day goes by
Running out of tears to cry
I'll lose my mind

Waiting for the right place and the right time
To tell ya what's been going on in my mind
Maybe we should take it slow
But I just wanna let you know
We've come too far to leave it all behind

I tried to give you love but you wouldn't take it
I don't know what I'll do if we don't make it
Girl I'm so glad I found you
I've built my whole world around you
Right here in my heart
I feel it breaking

We've got to come to a decision
Right away
Because tomorrow is too late to start again
We've got to come to a decision
Find a way
'Cause if another day goes by
Running out of tears to cry
I'll lose my mind

From now on
You will come to see a change
From now on
You'll no longer have to wait
To see a different side
Come on let's take that ride
Into paradise
It would be so nice

If we could come to a decision
Right away
Because tomorrow is too late to start again
We've got to come to a decision
Find a way
'Cause if another day goes by
Running out of tears to cry
I'll lose my mind, right away
Because tomorrow is too late to start again

We've got to come to a decision
Find a way
'Cause if another day goes by
Running out of tears to cry
I'll lose my mind, right away
Because tomorrow, oh don't you know
That it's much too late to start again

We've got to come to a decision
Find a way
'Cause if another day goes by
Running out of tears to cry
I'll lose my mind
Because tomorrow is too late to start again

We've got to come to a decision
Find a way
'Cause if another day goes by
I feel like I'm running out of tears to cry
Yeah

// Mama Lied //

Lola likes her men in the palm of her hand
That' the way she's got it planned, Lola (Lola)
And James ain't ashamed with he's running his game
(As) long as he's not to blame, go James (go James)

As the world is going through it's changes
You better keep your eyes open wide
Cause in the middle of all this strangeness
I guess someones's singin' "Mama lied"

Mama lied, Mama lied...

My Moma don't mind, when I need to unwind
It's a sign of good times, good time (good times)
And if I choose to get loose, I don't need to get used
I'm tellin' the truth, no lie (no lie)

Maybe you don't like, what's going on 'round you
And the world goes slidin' by
It's not exactly what your Mama told you
And you're wondering, why your Mama lied

Mama lied, Mama lied...

As a little boy you were overjoyed
With everything your Mama told you (told you)
Not at thirty-five you start to realize
Life ain't the fairy-tale your Mama sold you

Mama lied, Mama lied... [repeat til fade]

// I Like Your Style //

I remember the first day we met
That's the day I'll never forget
You came into my life, made everything right
I remember the first time we touched
Never knew that I could love so much
You ignited the flame, and I still feel the same

I like your style (I like your style)
I like your smile (I like it baby)
I love your heart and I loved you right from the start

I made a wish upon a lucky star
For someone special just the way you are
That wish came true, oh when I found you
I can still see that star shining bright
With this love there's no end in sight
It's just you and me, we're destined to be

I like your style (I like your style)
I like your smile (I like it baby)
I love your heart and I loved you right from the start

Each day is new (I like your style)
When I'm with you (I like it baby)
It's more than okay, getting better each and every way, yeah

There's only one thing that I'd like to do
I want to spend my whole life with you
Till death do us part, because you captured my heart

I like your style (I like your style)
I like your smile (I like it baby)
Each day is new (I like your style)
Oh, when I'm with you, baby
Oh, oh, oh, I like your style
(I like your style)

Come on now with me, I like your style
(I like your style)
You've got a sexy smile, now sugar
(I like your style)
Ooh... I like your smile now baby
(I like your style)

You sexy baby, sexy lady
I just want to be with you baby, baby
(I like it baby)
