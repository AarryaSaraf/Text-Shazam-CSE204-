// Backseat //

I can't escape all the voices, and so, I turn it up
I go to parties with strangers, so I can figure it out
Run through a city at midnight to feel like a star
I want it all, even if it's fake

Breakin' your heart, split it in half
Told you it all (told you it all)
Year and a half, are we in love?
I'll never know (I'll never know)
I know I'm wrong, what a mistake
I'll never change (I'll never change)
I can't escape all the voices, and so, I turn it up

In the backseat
Your song, so loud
Drivin' so fast
I'm better off alone

All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone

I'm wide awake, lyin' next to him, and feel it all
I got a thirst for distraction that I can't take back
My fingers run through his hair
I'm grippin' at regrets
I put my mouth on his lips to taste

Breakin' your heart, split it in half
Told you it all (told you it all)
Year and a half, are we in love?
I'll never know (I'll never know)
All that went wrong, what a mistake
I'll never change (I'll never change)
I can't escape all the voices, and so I turn it up

In the backseat
Your song, so loud
Drivin' so fast
I'm better off alone

All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone

'Wake lyin' next
I'm wide awake lyin' next
I'm wide awake lyin' next
I'm wide awake lyin' next
Take back, I gotta take back
I gotta take back, I gotta take back, I gotta
(In the)
My fingers run through his hair
My fingers run through his hair
(You're so)
My fingers run through his hair
My fingers run through his hair
(Drivin') In the (in the)
I gotta take back
All alone, all alone, all alone

All alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone

It's Charli, baby
It's Charli, baby

// Out Of My Head //

Eh-eh-X-C-X

Glitter in my sheets
Dancing on no sleep
I don't learn, wanna burn, wanna turn all the way up, yeah
I don't learn, wanna burn in the dirt 'til I'm out of luck, yeah

Pills and potions and terrible things
Heart on the floor when the telephone rings
All of the lies I just wanna believe
Drop all my morals, I just wanna sin

I'm out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my
Out of my head

Need you, need you, need you out
Need you, need you, need you out

Party with my tears
Swayin' with my fears, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let 'em dry, get me high, I'll get by if I'm gettin' love, yeah
Let 'em dry, get me high, I get by with a little love
Now give me

Pills and potions and terrible things
Heart on the floor when the telephone rings
All of the lies I just wanna believe
Drop all my morals, I just wanna sin

I'm out of my, out of my head
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my
Out of my head
Please, get out of my, out of my, out of my head

Secretly I'm into it though
You got me doin' all this stupid shit
You fuck me up like this
Secretly I'm kinda into it though
(You fuck me up like this)
You got me doin' all this stupid shit
You fuck me up like this

// Lucky //

Baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
Baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
You get away with it all
Baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
And even though you g-g-g-got me
You still want it all

So, can I ask you a question?
Do you ever feel guilt for what you done?
Call you, you got no reception
You're breakin' up
Tell you I believe you, but I don't

And baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
And baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
You get away with it all
Baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
And even though you g-g-g-got me
You still want it all

So, can I ask you a question?
Do you ever feel guilt for what you done?
Call you, you got no reception
You're breakin' up
Tell you I believe you, but I don't

And baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
But did you ever l-l-l-love me?
You're just way too numb (Numb), mmm, mmm
And baby, you're so lu-lu-lu-lucky
I know you never l-l-l-loved me
And I knew all along

All along
All along
All along
Ooh
Knew it all along
Knew it all along
Knew it all along

// Tears //

See through my eyes
Right down to where I fall apart
Wish me luck, wish me luck
Drive through the night
Head on your shoulder
But I miss you so much
So, so much

Say my name, so nervously now
Kiss in the hallway, fade out
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go
Try to hide the lies when we touch
Burn in the sheets with no love
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go

Used to be 5 star, yeah
Golden, golden
When I had nothing, you gave me silhouette dreams and
We made them real, somethin' like freedom
I killed the lights, went crazy
Throwin' all the china all around the kitchen
I kicked the ladder under you
Playin' dumb, shut tight, that ain't love, no
That ain't love

Say my name, so nervously now
Kiss in the hallway, fade out
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go
I tried to hide the lies when we touch
Burn in the sheets with no love
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go

Tears are rollin' down my face, holdin' on until we break
Now we're in a different place
(Now we're in a different place, tears are rollin' down my face)
I can feel my body ache, tears are rollin' down my face
Now you gotta go, go, go, go
Tears are rollin' down my face, holdin' on until we break
Now we're in a different place
(Now we're in a different place, tears are rollin' down my face)
I can feel my body ache, tears are rollin' down my face
Now you gotta go, go, go, go

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tears are rollin' down my face
Now you gotta go, go (now we're in a different place)

Say my name, so nervously now
Kiss in the hallway, fade out (kiss, fade out)
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go
Try to hide the lies when we touch
Burn in the sheets with no love (no love)
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face (face)
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go

Say my name and
Fade out
Down my face
Go, go
Tried to hide the lies when we touch
Burn in the sheets with no love
Tears are rollin' down my face, tears are rollin' down my face
Lies when
Tears are rollin' down my face, now you gotta go, go, go

Brooke Candy, fag mob

Have you heard her? Have you seen her?)

Got a couple of bitches that want my attention
They actin' real vicious, but I'm not offended
They lurkin' like witnesses, money I'm gettin'
Could drop an ice tray and I still won't be slippin'
(Got) Another check comin' in
(Got) A couple checks I ain't spend
(Got) Fat pockets, need a gym
(I) Made it possible like Kim
Today, I got great times
Square it out like FaceTime
Yellow tape around the body
But not measurin' waistlines (Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!)
Zero fucks, the amount (What?)
Zero bucks in your account (You broke!)
So many offers on the table (What?)
A bitch gotta eat on the couch

Go fuck your prototype

I feel the sparks between us
Electric shock
Hot-wired, if you mess it up
I'll self-destruct

The way you look at me
I-I-I short circuit

Like it or not

Electric shock
Hot-wired, if you F it up (five, four, three)

I'm a neutron bomb-bomb, blowin' the beat
Gonna spray that raygun and fall to his knees
I'm a lightnin' rod, I'ma bite that bod
Do you want a femmebot or do you want a ho-bot?
Slut-bot, fuck no, systems down
Boy, I'll clone you, boy, I'll swerve you
Glitch your mainframe, now I own you
Ex Machina-na-na, you can't win
I'm A.I. fly, I am that bitch
Is your love for real though?
I'm Trinity, you're Neo
I'm bionic, not ironic
Super Saiyan, supersonic
Hard drive crash, you don't remember
Charli bit yo wittle finga

// Porsche //

I've been fantasizin' 'bout a Porsche
Get that dough-oh-oh-oh
I've been kneadin', kneadin' 'til I'm sore
'Til it grow-oh-oh-oh
(X-C-X)
I've been runnin' 'round now for so long
Yeah, it seems that
Every day and everywhere I go
Yeah, I see ya
Baby, I just gotta let you know
I made dough-oh-oh-oh

Take back all your love 'cause
Fake words ain't enough, no
I gave it all, so emotional
But you only care how your money talks
One rose layin' on your grave 'cause
You pushed everyone away but
My mausoleum, pretty like Versailles
Man, I played it out 'bout a thousand times, yeah

You won't hear my teardrops when they're fallin'
Engine drownin' out the sound, you hear me comin'
Went and got it all, just to prove you wrong
Yeah, you spent my love, didn't spend my money

'Cause I've been fantasizin' 'bout a Porsche
Get that dough-oh-oh-oh
I've been kneadin', kneadin' 'til I'm sore
'Til it grow-oh-oh-oh
I've been runnin' 'round now for so long
Yeah, it seems that
Every day and everywhere I go
Yeah, I see ya
Baby, I just gotta let you know
I made dough-oh-oh-oh

Take back all your love 'cause
Fake words, they don't count, no
Yeah, I know your game
And you played it right
Wish you knew before but my love is blind
One rose layin' on your grave 'cause
You pushed everyone away, oh
Tell your new lover to enjoy the ride

Love, I do

Ooh

Every time you get too close I run, I run away
And every time you say the words, I don't know what to say
Back, back to the beginnin', really wish that I could change
I do, I do (I do)
