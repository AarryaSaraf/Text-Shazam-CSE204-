// Hello, Young Lovers //

Hello young lovers who ever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you

Be brave young lovers and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
You got to cling to each other and very close tonight
I've been in love like you

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And fly down the street in a trance
You fly down a street on a chance that you'll meet
And you meet not really by chance

Don't cry young lovers what ever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone

All of my memories are happy tonight
I've had a love of my own

I've had a love of my own like yours
I've had a love of my own

// At Last //

At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song

At last
The sky above is blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream, that I could speak to
A dream that I, can call my own
I found a thrill, to press my cheek to
A thrill that I, have never ever known

You, you smiled
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last

I found a dream, I found a dream
That I could speak to, baby
A dream that I, can definitely call my own
I found a thrill, I found a thrill
To press my cheek to, to press my cheek to
A thrill that I, have never ever known

You smiled, you smiled, baby
And then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for you are mine
At last
You are mine at last
At last
You're mine, baby

// Light My Fire //

You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire, yeah

The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try now we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire, yeah

You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

Come on baby, light my fire
Come on baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire
Try to set the night on fire

// The Shadow Of Your Smile //

The shadow of your smile when you are gone
Will color all my dreams and light the dawn
Look into my eyes, my love, and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips andd so did I
Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The Shadow of your smile

// You And Me //

You and me
Eternally
You and me
We're a reality
Peace of mind
Other are searching for
They never find
We've had it all the time

So in love
That's how we live
Never take
Darling we always give
Happiness is every day
But it never would be
If it wasn't for you loving me

I was lost
Like a rolling stone I had to roam
As if I knew
That in time I'd find my way to
Here I am
In a paradise just built for two
It's good enough for me
It's good enough for you

You and me
Eternally
You and me
We're a reality
Peace of mind
Others are searching for
And never find
We've had it all the time

One more thing
I wanna say
I've sacrificed day and night
To keep you happy
One more thing
I forgot to say
I bless the day I found ya
Cause I've built my world around ya

You and me
Eternally
You and me
We're a reality
Peace of mind
Others are searching for
And never find
We've had it all the time

Hey so in love
That's how we live
Never take, never take
Always give
Happiness is every single day
But it never would be baby
If it wasn't for you loving me

// Somebody Knows, Somebody Cares //

Oh yellow moon you make me think of home
Down in Arkansas where I was raised and born
Oh muddy street where I used to play
I think of leaving here and coming home one day

Somebody knows, somebody cares
This dream of mine my baby shares

Deep in her heart though she won't tell me so
There's something troubling her
And I know I know
She dreams of rocky hills
Pretty little corn fields
And sitting 'round that mighty oak
Talking to those friendly folks

Somebody knows, somebody cares
This dream of hers oh yeah
My little heart shares

One of these days
I'm gonna take my own two hands
Build us a cottage
On that old southern land

Somebody knows, somebody cares
This dream of mine my baby shares

I'm coming back oh yeah
Back to old little rock, hey

I'm coming home yeah yeah
Back to that old little rock, ha
Gonna stay there yeah
Ain't going nowhere

Somebody knows, somebody cares
This dream of mine my baby shares

// Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday //

Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday
What happened to the world we knew
When we would dream and scheme
And while the time away
Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday

Where did it go that yester-glow
When we could feel
The wheel of life turn our way
Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday

I had a dream so did you
Life was warm and love was true
Two kids who followed all the rules
Yester-fools and now

Now it seems those yester dreams
Were just a cruel
And foolish game we used to play
Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday

When I recall what we had
I feel lost I feel sad with nothing but
The memory of yester-love and now
Now it seems those yester-dreams
Were just a cruel
And foolish game we had to play

Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday
Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday
Sing with me
Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday
One more time...

// Angie Girl //

I was drifting from day to day
Like a child that's lost his way
In a great big world

Then a miracle happened by
When you happened into my life
And said you love me
All around me the world was cold
Then you tenderly touched my soul
With your sunshine girl

And my future you gave it birth
And my living you gave it worth
Little Angie
Cause I love you, Angle girl
I love you, yes, I do
Heaven knows my heart is true,
Oh ho ho

When I'm feelin' my faith is gone
You're my reason for going on
Through another day
Cause the tender times that we share
Truly show me that you care about me

Whenever life makes you cry
Just remember I'm standing by
To lead the way
And together we'll never fall
Together we'll conquer all
Little Angie
Cause I love you, Angle girl
I love you, yes, I do
Heaven knows my heart is true
Cause I love you, Angle girl
I love you, yes, I do
Heaven knows my heart is true

// Give Your Love //

When I look at love I look at you
Look at me and you'll see
Love is burning inside of me
But the flame needs you to make it brighter
Give to me what you see
Make the moment a lifetime

Give your love
Give your love to only me
Give the chance I need
To let you see
You will be the other half of me

Give your love
Give your love and lead the way
Turn the cold of winter into May
Through a thousand winters
Love will stay

We'll build a dream
Just big enough for two, girl
We'll build a world that's made of only love
You'll be the one
Who makes my life worth living
You'll keep me strong
When I stumble and I fall

So, Give your love
Give your love don't let me down
Don't reduce me to a nervous clown
You know that I'll always be around

Everyday that we're apart I cry girl
When you're gone all I long for
Is when you'll be near me
Everyday a thousand times I die girl
Far away how I pray there is some way
You'll let me...

Give your love
Ohh, Give your love your tears and pain
I will be your shelter through the rain
Through the storm my love for you won't change

So, Give your love
Give your love and give your heart
Never, never will love let us part
We were meant to be lovers from the start

So la la la
Ohh, Give your love don't let me down
Don't reduce me to a nervous clown
You know that I'll always be around

Angie give your love
Oh, give your love, don't make me cry

// I've Got You //

Baby I'm glad I've got you oh oh oh
Baby I'm glad I've got you oh oh oh

Somebody tried to tell me
That you've been running around
They must have you mixed up
With another girl in town

Cause as sure as I know
That a broken heart has got its baby
That how sure I know
Baby I can claim
That I've got you

Baby I'm glad I've got you oh oh oh
Baby I'm glad I've got you oh oh oh

In a thousand little ways
I can tell you really love me (really love me)
In a thousand little thing you do

I can tell you really love me (really love me)

And as sure as I know
That a crying child has got his tears
That's how sure I know
I can love you with no fear
Cause I've got you

Baby I'm glad I've got you oh oh oh
Baby I'm glad I've got you oh oh oh

And as sure as I know
That a singing bird has got his song
That's how sure I know
Baby I cant be wrong to say that I've got you

I've got you
I've got you
