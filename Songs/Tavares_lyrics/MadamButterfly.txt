// Straight From Your Heart //

Some may not think what you do is right
Just might hold it against you
No matter how hard you try and fight
Some still may resent you

Alright if it's coming
Straight from your heart
You knew where to start (straight from your heart)
Alright if it's coming
Coming, coming
Straight from your heart
Ooh, you knew where to start

I look around, it's clear to see
You need love just like me
I've seen enough to know by now
When love fails to show it, show somehow

Alright if it's coming
Alright if it's coming
Straight from your heart
Ooh, you knew where to start
Alright if it's coming
Coming, coming, coming
Straight from your heart
Ooh, you knew where to start

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Coming straight, coming straight
Coming straight, coming straight
From your heart

Can't entertain a fantasy
In such a neat reality
You can share your love now as you pass
Oh, if it's not too much to ask

Alright if it's coming
Alright, alright
Straight from your heart
You knew where to start
You knew where to start
Alright if it's coming
Let it come on, come on in
Straight from your heart
Ooh, you knew, you knew where to start

Let me see you coming, coming straight from your heart
(Straight from your heart)
Oh girl, you knew where to start
(Straight from your heart)
Always doing, doing your part
(Straight from the heart)
Let it keep coming, coming
(Straight from your heart)
'Cause you knew where to, where to, where to start
Let me see you coming, coming straight from your heart
(Let me see you coming straight, straight from your heart)
Always doing, doing your part
(Let me see you where it's coming straight from your heart)
Oh, it's doing your part
(Let me see you coming straight, straight from your heart)
Ooh, you brought it, you brought it
(Let me see you where it's coming straight from your heart)
Bring it, bring it on down
Mm, yeah, yeah
Ah yeah

Y'all feel that breakdown?
(Yeah!)
You were? Break it down again!

Now listen here
Have you ever been in love before?
(Yeah!)
Have you ever been hurt before?
(Yeah? Oh yeah!)
Would you let the love coming straight from your heart?
(Yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!)
You sure you let the love coming straight from your heart?
(Yeah!)
Would you let the love, I said, coming straight from the heart?
(Yeah!)
Well, show me you want the love coming straight from the heart?
(Yeah!)
I said, would everybody want the love coming straight from the heart?
(Yeah!)

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hey baby, come on (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everybody, clap your hands (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh, everybody say yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bring it, bring it on from your heart (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bring it, bring it from your heart (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause you knew where to start (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, my baby (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

// Games, Games //

Games, games is what the people constantly play
Games, games

Another heart fell by the wayside
One more love affair ended today
Somebody cried, 'cause someone said it was over
(They said it was over)
One was serious, but the other wanted to play

It's a merry go round of emotions
(Merry go round, merry go round of emotions)
A three-ring circus affair
You promise to light me with devotion (well and uh)
But she's in love with someone else

Oh, these games, games is what the people constantly play
Yet all of us, all of us still wanna be loved
Hey, games, games is what the people constantly play
Yet all of us, all of us still wanna be loved
Games, games

It's an everyday situation
(Everyday situation)
Somebody says how much someone fills their needs
But you might as well give out applications
(Give out applications)
Since everyone keeps changing up their seasonings

It's a hopeless ball of confusion
(Hopeless ball of confusion, hopeless ball of confusion)
Broken promises plays the leading role
And tears simply flow like a river
(Flow like a river)
Well and uh
Girl, tonight we're lovers, but tomorrow we're foes

Games, games is what the people constantly play
Oh yeah, oh yeah, baby
Yet all of us, yet all of us still wanna be loved
Hey, yeah, yeah
Games, games is what the people constantly play
Yet all of us, yet all of us still wanna be loved

Oh, games, games, that's what the people constantly play
Yet all of us, yet all of us still wanna be loved
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Games, games is what the people constantly play
Hey babe, hey baby, can you hear what I say?
Yet all of us, yet all of us still wanna be loved
Yeah, baby
Games, games is what the people constantly play
Don't play no games, baby
I don't need the problems
Yet all of us still wanna be loved

// Never Had A Love Like This Before //

Oh, you sure
You sure have got me, girl

At last I'm past the fantasy
Into my reality, oh yes, you are
More than just the love talkin'
Hey girl, we've got it workin', workin', workin'

Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love like this before
Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love

I'm so glad that I was patient
Lord, sent me your heavenly creation, oh yes, he did
You're all I needed, needed, yeah
Oh, but it's all I conceded

Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love like this before
Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love

Love's in your tender touch
'Cause everyday askin' for too much
Oh, I'm in love with what you doin'
Never get tired, I'ma watchin' you

Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love like this before
Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love

I've been in a lotta situation
But never like this before, oh no
There's been so much, so much anticipation
[Incomprehensible] and everybody needs it

Everybody's lookin' for a good situation
Uptown, downtown, all around the world
Lookin' for the right girl
Hopin' an' prayin', oh, some never find it

Right boy or the right girl
Looking for the right boy, looking for the right girl
Hear what the fellas are sayin'
Never, never ever, ever, ever, never had a love like this before

Never, never, no, no
Never, never ever, ever, ever
Ever had a love like this before
Do you hear what fellas are sayin'?

Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love like this before
Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love

Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love like this before
Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love

Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love like this before
Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love
