// The Mighty Power Of Love //

The mighty power of love
Has got more force than any shove
Love can open any door
Stand alone on any floor
If you're in love
Why don't you check it out

The mighty power of love
Grows sweeter than the flower's bud
Love can break through shields of anger
Make a friend out of a stranger
Can't say enough
Love can do so much
Love can make a winter's day
Seem like the Fourth of July
Oh, love can make a lover's dream
Come true before his eyes

Oh whoa (whoa-whoa)
Oh-oh-oh-whoa (ah)

The mighty power of love
Has got more force than any shove
It's your lifeboat to the shore
Your umbrella when it pours
Can't say enough
Love can do so much

Mighty power
Power of love, yeah
Mighty power
Power of love, yeah

Ooh, love can give the beggar courage
Courage to face up to kings
Oh, love can make the rich man's clothes
Love can do many things

Oh whoa (oh-whoa)
Oh-oh-oh-whoa (ah)

The mighty power of love
Has got more force than any shove
It's your ladder to the top
It's your net when you've been dropped
Can't say enough
Love can do so much

The mighty power of love (the mighty power of love)
Can't say enough, love can do so much
The mighty power of love
If you're in love, why don't you check it out

Mighty power (mighty, mighty power)
Power of love, yeah (get down with the power)
Mighty power (mighty, mighty power)
Power of love, yeah (get down with the groove, y'all)
Mighty power (it's got more push than shove, yeah)
Power of love, yeah (talkin' about love when love is lost)
Mighty power (your lifeboat to the shore, yeah)
Power of love, yeah (the mighty, mighty, mighty power)
Mighty power (got to have love, yeah-yeah)
Power of love, yeah (gonna sing this song love, hey-hey)
Mighty power (ooh-hoo, gonna sing a song, y'all)
Power of love, yeah (hey, hey, hey, hey, gonna shake it off)
Mighty power (gonna shake it off, gotta shake it off)
Power of love, yeah (ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo, hey, hey, hey)

// Ridin' High //

Going up, mm
Going up, you and me, girl
Going up, c'mon

Living it up and loving it
Ooh, feels so good, we're together
Getting up close, mm, and gettin' down
We've been like a hand and glove
Up here on the wings of love

Hey, we're ridin' high
Hey, we're ridin' high
(Like the sun up in the sky)
Hey, we're ridin' high

Hey, we're ridin' high (ridin' high)
Hey, we're ridin' high
(Dancing on the stars as we go by)
Hey, ridin' high, ridin' high

Shoo-doop, shoo-doop
Shoo-doop, shoo-doop

Elevating, that's what your kisses are
Whenever you're near me, I see shooting stars
Body and soul locked in blissful unity
I'll stay yours if you stay mine
We won't ever have to leave cloud nine

Hey, we're ridin' high (going up)
Hey, we're ridin' high
(You're my beautiful butterfly)
Hey, we're ridin' high

Hey, we're ridin' high (ridin' high)
Hey, we're ridin' high
(I'm your eagle on the wing, keeping a watch for love)
Hey, ridin' high, ridin' high

We're gonna feel this mellow mood
Don't stop now (hey)
Just getting good (just gettin' good)
(Just getting good)

Hey, we're ridin' high (hey, we're ridin' high)
Hey, we're ridin' high
(Like the sun up in the sky)
Hey, we're ridin' high

Hey, we're ridin' high (oh, baby)

// To The Other Man //

Hey Mama, hey Mama

Mama used to take me across her lap
She used to whip me with a strap
When I was bad
I didn't know at the time
Being bad could lead to crime
But now I'm glad

Well, she kept me on the double
I stayed out of trouble
Now I understand
She said, "Son, you gotta give a heck
Promise you'll always give respect
To the other man"

When I used to make fun of others
She'd say, "No not to your brothers"
And that ain't all (that ain't all)
"When someone is feeling low
Think of the nicest things you know
To make them feel tall"

I'll never forget what Mama said
When she kneeled down and prayed
For my father's guiding hand
"Throw your arms around his neck
Make him proud to give respect
To the other man"

Whoa, now that I'm a man (now that I'm a man)
God has taken my mother's hand (God has taken my mother's hand)
And now-ow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow, I'll carry on
Oh, sometimes I'll have to weep
Mother's love I'll always keep
'Cause she made me strong

And if I should ever have a son (if I should ever have a son)
We're gonna have lots of fun (we're gonna have lots of fun)
And I'll teach him up to understand
She said, "Son, you gotta give a heck
Promise you'll always give respect
To the other man"

She said, "Son, you gotta give a heck (you gotta give respect)
Promise you'll always give respect" (and I know, I know, I know what my mother would tell me)
She said, "Son, you gotta give a heck (you gotta give respect)
Promise you'll always give respect"

She said, "Son, you gotta give a heck (you gotta give respect now)
Promise you'll always give respect" (and I know, I know, I know what my mother would tell me)
She said, "Son, you gotta give a heck (you gotta give respect)
Promise you'll always give respect"

She said, "Son, you gotta give a heck
Promise you'll always give respect
To the other man"

// Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel //

Heaven must be missing an angel
Missing one angel, child, 'cause you're here with me right now
(Your love is heavenly, baby)
(Heavenly to me, baby)

Your kiss, filled with tenderness
I want all I can get of your sexiness
Showers, your love comes in showers
And every hour on the hour
You let me feel your loving power

There's a rainbow over my shoulder (ooh, ooh)
When you came, my cup runneth over (ooh, ooh)
You gave me your heavenly love
And if one night you hear crying from above

(Heaven)

You must have slipped away along the Milky Way
It's 'cause (your kiss) your kiss (filled with tenderness)
You came C.O.D. on a moonbeam straight to me
Just like (showers) showers (showers, showers, showers)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Your heavenly power gets stronger by the hour

// Guiding Star //

I'll be your guiding star
My darling, cross my heart
I'll never leave you in the dark
Oh-oh, and I'll be your light
At the top of the stairs
(And when you lay me down to sleep)
I'll be the answer to your prayers

When your tomorrow seems uphill
When plans go wrong and leave you standing still
When you just cry and cry against your will
I'll sing a lullaby to make you smile
To brighten up your life

I'll be your guiding star
My darling, cross my heart
I'll never leave you in the dark
Oh-oh, and I'll be your light
At the top of the stairs
(And when you lay me down to sleep)
I'll be the answer to your prayers

I'll love you till the desert has no sand
Until the mighty sea covers all the land
Until my body turns to dust again
With every breath I take, step I make
I'll make sure you feel secure

I'll be your guiding star
My darling, cross my heart
I'll never leave you in the dark
Oh-oh, and I'll be your light
At the top of the stairs
(And when you lay me down to sleep)
I'll be the answer to your prayers

(I'll be your guiding star) Your guiding star
(My darling cross my heart) Cross my heart
(I'll never leave you in the dark) I'll never leave you, baby

And you'll be my precious lamb

I love you so much
And baby, I'll keep you in my heart
Wherever I am, wherever I am

// Don't Take Away The Music //

Don't take away the music
It's the only thing I've got
It's my piece of the rock

I knew you were always there
You were my song (you were my song)
How am I supposed to bear it
Now that you're gone

Would you separate the words
Ooh, from a sweet melody
Baby, would you take away
The music from a symphony

Don't take away (don't take away) the music (please)
It's the only thing I've got
It's my piece of the rock
Don't take away (don't take away) the music (no)
Everything else is gone
Don't strip my world of its song

Every time you whispered low
My heart would sing (my heart would sing)
Now it's silent like a phone
The phone that never rings

Memories of love's refrain
Memories keep haunting me
What are we doing to the song we sang
What happened to our sweet harmony

Don't take away (don't take away) the music (please)
It's the only thing I've got
It's my piece of the rock (don't take, don't take, you)
Don't take away (don't take away) the music (no)
Everything else is gone
Don't strip my world of its song

Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo (no, no, no)
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo (don't take away, oh love, please)
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo (leave me here with nothing)

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Since you're not here with me
My whole life seems out of key

Don't take away (don't take away) the music (please)
It's the only thing I've got
It's my piece of the rock (don't take, don't take, you)
Don't take away (don't take away, yeah) the music (please)
Everything else is gone
Don't strip my world of its song

Don't take away (don't take away) the music (no)
It's the only thing I've got
It's my piece of the rock
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

Don't take away the music
It's the only thing I've got
It's my piece of the rock
Don't take away (don't take away, yeah) the music (I love ya)
Everything else is gone
Don't strip my world of its song (don't take, don't take, you)

Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo (you got my heart, y'see)
Don't take my music, donât take it away (you're havin' fun)
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo (with no heart left in me, baby)
Don't take my music, donât take it away (since you been gone)

Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo
Don't take my music, donât take it away
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo
Don't take my music, donât take it away

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo
Don't take my music, donât take it away
Don't take my music, ooh-hoo-hoo
Don't take my music, donât take it away
Don't take my music
