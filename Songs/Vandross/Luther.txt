// Funky Music (Is A Part Of Me) //

Every time I hear funky music
I just can't stand still
I've got to move
Every time I feel my motor getting in gear
Funky music is somewhere near

Funky music sure enough is a part of me
I'll do the singing
Just give me the beat from the drummer, please
Funky music, it's deep inside of me
I can't help it; I've got to move
Every time funky music comes around

Funky sounds I hear when I'm walking
It seems like everywhere I turn
I hear the funky beat
People think I'm a little crazy
'Cause they'll see me walking
Then I'll start dancing in the street (Sock it to me)

Funky music sure enough is a part of me
I'll do the singing
Just give me the beat from the drummer, please
Everybody dance to the funky sound
I go crazy, yes, I do
Every time funky music comes around

Funky music sure enough is a part of me
I'll do the singing
Just give me the beat from the drummer, please
Funky music, it's deep inside of me
I can't help it; I've got to move
Every time funky music comes around

// The 2nd Time Around //

Well by now you know I'm insatiable
'Cause when you step to leave I want a full repeat, yeah
It's a miracle, you were right inside my head
If the feeling's nice, why not do it twice?
It is not against the law, no baby
I slave all through the week
And I need my release
I work hard so when I stop
I gotta get a little satisfaction for me
Hit it again
Don't care if I'm late
The world just has to wait

Hit it again, hit it again, baby
Hit it again
I loved it the first time
Sent chills up through my spine
Hit it again, hit it again, baby

Deep emotion ain't got nothing to do with it
And being in love ain't really got a thing to do with it
I hope you understand
But I can't worry if you don't, oh no
If I can't double up
It's like I didn't get enough
Call me greedy if you want, just do it
But it's something that will never change
I don't get no complaints
They know it when they ring my bell
That this could be a thing that could take a little while, well, well
Hit it again
Don't care if I'm late
The world just has to wait

Hit it again, hit it again, baby
Hit it again
I loved it the first time
Sent chills up through my spine
Hit it again, hit it again, baby

I declare the point to be
Once is not enough for me
Two time lovin' makes me smile
One time love just ain't my style
Repeat the love and I have found
More the second time around
It builds me up I love to love
And if I can't hit it again
It ain't natural
Hit it again
Don't care if I'm late
The world just has to wait

Hit it again, hit it again, baby
Hit it again
I loved it the first time
Sent chills up through my spine
Hit it again, hit it again, baby

// I'll Get Along Fine //

How am I gonna get along
After loving you for so long?
How am I gonna find good times when you're gone?
How am I gonna fill
This emptiness that sure enough
Will leave me hungry for your love?

[Chorus:]
I'll get along fine without you, baby
Oh, yes, I will get along somehow
I've made up my mind
To try and keep trying and trying
I guess I'll do fine
I guess I'll be alright

Seems I should be sad
But somehow separating ain't that bad
I'd love for you to see me cry
But the tears won't come to my eyes
I'm really glad
That we can break up peacefully
You'll be glad to know. Don't you worry, 'cause

[Repeat Chorus]

Sometimes it seems kind of strange
To call your name
And then look around and you're not there
Everything is fine
'Cause I've made up my mind to get along twice as well

[Repeat Chorus]

// Everybody Rejoice //

Everybody look around
'Cause there's a reason to rejoice you see
Everybody come out
And let's commence to singing joyfully
Everybody look up
And feel the hope that we've been waiting for

Everybody's glad
Because our silent fear and dread is gone
Freedom, you see, has got our hearts singing so joyfully
Just look about
You owe it to yourself to check it out
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?

Everybody be glad
Because the sun is shining just for us
Everybody wake up
Into the morning into happiness

Hello world
It's like a different way of living now
And thank you world
We always knew that we'd be free somehow
In harmony
And show the world that we've got liberty

It's such a change
For us to live so independently
Freedom, you see, has got our hearts singing so joyfully
Just look about
You owe it to yourself to check it out
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?

Everybody be glad
Because the sun is shining just for us
Everybody wake up
Into the morning into happiness
Hello world
It's like a different way of living now
And thank you world
We always knew that we'd be free somehow
In harmony
And show the world that we've got liberty

It's such a change
For us to live so independently
Freedom, you see, has got our hearts singing so joyfully
Just look about
You owe it to yourself to check it out
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?

// This Strange Feeling //

Hey, look at me, uncompromising me
Not the least bit affected
By the love that anyone else gives

Hey, look at me, untouchable me
Can't even be reached
Until you come around and then

This strange feeling takes me over
Leaving me weak until you're out of view
And I can't see your face anymore

Lazy, sometimes I'm lazy, baby
Sitting in my easy chair
I find satisfaction there
Whenever you look my way
Everything changes and then

This strange feeling takes me over
Leaving me weak until you're out of view
And I can't see your face anymore
