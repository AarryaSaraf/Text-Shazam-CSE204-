Album: BodyAndSoul

// Body And Soul //

You're making me blue
All that you do
Seems unfair
You try not to hear
Turn a deaf ear
To my prayer
It seems you don't want to see
What you are doing to me
My arms are waiting to caress you
And to my heart they long to press you, sweet heart

My heart is sad and lonely
For you I cry
For you, dear, only
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you
Body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering it's me you're wronging
Why haven't you seen it?
I'm all for you
Body and soul

I can't believe it
It hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending?
Don't say it's the ending
I wish I could have one more change to prove, dear
My life a hell you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender
Myself to you
Body and soul

Life's dreary for me 
Day's seem to be long as years
I've looked for the sun
But can see none
Through my tears
Your heart must be like a stone
To leave me like this alone
When you could make my life worth living
By taking what I'm set on giving, sweet heart

My heart is sad and lonely
For you I cry
For you, dear, only
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you
Body and soul

// They Can't Take That Away From Me //

The way you wear your hat;
The way you sip your tea;
The memory of all that.
No, no, they can't take that away from me.

The way your smile just beams;
The way you sing off key;
The way you haunt my dreams.
No, no, they can't take that away from me.

We may never, never meet again
On on the bumpy road to love.
Still I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife;
The way we danced 'til three;
The way you've changed my life.
No, no, they can't take that away from me.

The way you wear your hat;
The way you sip your tea;
The memory of all that.
No, no, they can't take that away from me.

The way your smile just beams;
The way you sing off key;
The way you haunt my dreams.
No, no, they can't take that away from me.

We may never, never meet again
On on the bumpy road to love.
Still I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife;
The way we danced 'til three;
The way you've changed my life.
No, no, they can't take that away from me.
No, they can't take that away from me.

// Darn That Dream //

Darn that dream
I dream each night
You say you love me and hold me tight
But when I awake and you're out of sight
Oh, darn that dream

Darn your lips and darn your eyes
They lift me high above the moonlit sky
Then I tumble out of paradise
Oh, darn that dream

Darn that one track mind of mine
It can't understand that you don't care
Just to change the mood I'm in
I'd welcome a nice old nightmare

Darn that dream
And bless it too
Without that dream I never have you
But it haunts me and it won't come true

Oh, darn that dream

// Let's Call The Whole Thing Off //

You say either
And I say either
You say neither
And I say neither
Either, either, neither, neither
Let's call the whole thing off

You like potatoes
And I like potatoes
You like tomatoes
And I like tomatoes
Potatoes, potatoes, tomatoes, tomatoes
Let's call the whole thing off

But oh, if we call the whole thing off
Then we must part
And oh, if we ever part
Then that might break my heart

So it you like pajarnas and I like pajamas
I'll wear pajamas and give up pajamas
For we know we need each other
So we'd better call the calling off, off
Let's call the whole thing off

So if you go for oysters
And I go for oysters
I'll order oysters and cancel the oysters
For we know we need each other
So we'd better call the calling off, off
Let's call the whole thing off

// Comes Love //

Comes a rainstorm, get your rubbers on your feet
Comes a snow-storm, you can get a little heat
Comes love, nothing can be done

Comes a fire, then you know just what to do
Blow a tire, you can buy another sure
Comes love, nothing can be done

Don't try hiding cause there isn't any use
You start sliding when your heart turns on the juice

Comes a headache, you can lose it in a day
Comes a toothache, see your dentist right away
Comes love, nothing can be done

Comes a heat-wave, you can hurry to the shore
Comes a summons, you can hide behind the door
Comes love, nothing can be done

Comes the measles, you can quarantine the room
Comes a mousy, you can chase it with the broom
Comes love, nothing can be done

That's all brother, if you've ever been in love
That's all, brother, you know what I'm speaking of

Comes a nightmare, you can always stay awake
Comes depression, you may get another break
Comes love, nothing can be done

// Gee Baby Ain't I Good To You //

What makes me treat you the way I do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you
There's nothing in the world, too good for a girl that's good and true
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

Bought you a fur coat for Christmas
A diamond ring, a big Cadillac car and everything
Its love that makes me treat you the way I do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

What makes me treat you the way I do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you
There's nothing in the world, too good for a guy that's good and true
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

Fur coat for Christmas
A diamond ring, big Cadillac car and everything
There's nothing in the world that I wouldn't do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

What makes me treat you the way I do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you
There's nothing in the world too good for a girl that's good and true
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

Fur coat for Christmas
A diamond ring, big Cadillac car and everything
Its love that makes me treat you the way that I do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

// Embraceable You //

George and Ira Gershwin 

Embrace me
My sweet embraceable you
Embrace me 
My irreplaceable you
Just to look at you
My heart grows tipsy in me
You and you alone

Bring out the gypsy in me

I love all
The  many charms about you
Above  all
I  want my arms about you
Don't be naughty baby
Come to me
Come to me do
My sweet embraceable you

I love all
The  many charms about you
Above  all
I  want my arms about you
Don't be naughty baby
Come to me
Come to me do
My sweet embraceable you

// Moonlight In Vermont //

Pennies in a stream
Falling leaves a sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont

Gentle finger waves
Ski trails down a mountain side
Snowlight in Vermont

Telegraph cables, how they sing down the highway
As they travel each bend in the road
And when people meet, in this romantic setting
They're so hypnotized be the lovely...

Evening summer breeze
Sweet warblings of the meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont
