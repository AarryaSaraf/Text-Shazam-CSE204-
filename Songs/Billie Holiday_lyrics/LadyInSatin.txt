// I'm A Fool To Want You //

I'm a fool to want you
I'm a fool to want you
To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too

I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss not mine alone
To share a kiss that Devil has known

Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you
And once again these words I had to say

Take me back, I love you
...I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong I can't get along

Without you

// For Heaven's Sake //

For heavens sake let's fall in love
It's no mistake to call it love
An angel's holding hands with me
How heavenly heaven can be 

Here is romance for us to try
Here is a chance we can't deny
While heaven's giving us a break
Let's fall in love for heaven's sake
Don't say a word my darling
Don't break the spell like this
Just hold me tight; we're alone in the night
And heaven is here with a kiss 

This pair of eyes can see a star
So paradise can't be so far
Since heaven's what we're dreaming of
For heavens sake, let's fall in love

// You Don't Know What Love Is //

You don't know what love is
Until you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had to lose
You don't know what love is

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost
You don't know what love is

Do you know how lost heart feels
At the thought of reminiscing?
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing

You don't know how hearts burn
For love that cannot live yet never dies
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes
You don't know what love is

You don't know how hearts burn
For love that cannot live yet never dies
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes
You don't know what love is

What love is

// I Get Along Without You Very Well //

I get along without you very well
Of course, I do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves
Then I recall
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms
Of course, I do
But I get along without you very well

I've forgotten you just like I should
Of course, I have
Except to hear your name
Or someone's laugh that is the same
But I've forgotten you just like I should

What a guy
What a fool am I
To think my breaking heart
Could kid the moon
What's in store
Should I fall once more
No, it's best that I stick to my tune

I get along without you very well
Of course, I do
Except perhaps in Spring
But I should never think of Spring
For that would surely break my heart in two

What's in store
Should I fall once more
No, it's best that I stick to my tune

I get along without you very well
Of course, I do
Except perhaps in Spring
But I should never think of Spring
For that would surely break my heart in two

// For All We Know //

Sweetheart, the night is growing old
Sweetheart, my love is still untold
A kiss that is never tasted
Forever and ever is wasted

For all we know, we may never meet again
Before you go, make this moment sweet again
We won't say, goodnight until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand and my heart will be in it

For all we know this may only be a dream
We come and go like a ripple on a stream
So love me tonight, tomorrow was made for some
Tomorrow may never come, for all we know

// Violets For Your Furs //

It was winter in Manhattan
Falling snowflakes filled the air
The streets were covered with a film of ice
But a little simple magic that I'd heard about somewhere
Changed the weather all around, just within a trice

You bought me violets for my furs
And it was spring for a while, remember?
You bought me violets for my furs
And there was april in that december
The snow drifted on the flowers and melted where it lay
The snow looked like dew on the blossoms
As on a summer day

You bought me violets for my furs
And there was blue in the wintry sky
You pinned the violets to my furs
And gave a lift to the crowds passing by
You smiled at me so sweetly
Since then one thought occurs
That we fell in love completely
The day you bought me violets for my furs

// You've Changed //

I've an awfully feelling
That this thought that's been a stealin thru my brain
Is not to be ignored
But to really tell the truth
Though I'm not a well known sleuth
I honestly believe that you are bored
You've changed

That sparkle in your eyes is gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart
You've changed

You've changed
Your kisses now are so blase
You're bored with me in every way
I can't understand
You've changed
You've forgotten the words, "I love you"
Each memory that we've shared
You ignore every star above you
I can't realize you've ever cared
You've changed

You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me what we're through
It's all over now
You've changed

// It's Easy To Remember //

Your sweet expression
The smile you gave me,
The way you looked when we meet
It's easy to remember 
But so hard to forget. 
I hear you whisper,
I'll always lave you
I know it's over and yet
It's easy to remember 
But so hard to forget.

So I must dream
To have your hand caress me,
Fingers press me tight.
I'd rather dream
Than have the lonely feeling
Stealing through the nigh.

Each little moment
Is clear before me,
And though it brings me regret
It's easy to remember 
But so hard to forget.

// But Beautiful //

Love is funny or it's sad
Or it's quit or it's mad
It's a good thing or it's bad

But beautiful
Beautiful to take a chance and if you fall, you fall
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all
Love is tearful or it's gay
It's a problem or it's a play
It's heartache either way

But beautiful
And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go
And that would be
But beautiful
I know
Love is beautifull
I know

// Glad To Be Unhappy //

Look at yorself.
If you had the sense of humor,
You would laught to beat the band.

Look at yourself.
Do you still belive in rumor
that romance is simply grand?

Since you took it right
on the chin,
you have lost that bright
toothpaste grin.

My mental state is all a jumble.
I sit around and sadly mumble.

Fools rush in, so here I am,
very glad to be unhappy.

Unrequited love's a bore,
and I've got it pretty bad.
But for someone you adore,
it's a pleasure to be sad

Like a straying baby lamb
with no mammy and no pappy,
I'm so unhappy,
but oh, so glad.

// I'll Be Around //

I'll be around no matter how you treat me now,
I'll be around from now on.
Your latest love can never last,
And when it's past, I'll be around when she's gone.

Goodbye again and if you find a love like mine,
Just now and then drop a line
to say you're feeling fine.
And when things go wrong,
perhaps you'll see you're meant for me,
So, I'll be around when she's gone.

// The End Of A Love Affair //

So I walk a little too fast and I drive a little too fast
And I'm reckless it's true, but what else can you do at the
end of a love affair?

So I talk a little too much, and I laugh a little too much
And my voice is too loud, when I'm out in a crowd
So that people are apt to stare

Do they know, do they care, that it's only that I'm lonely
and low as can be?
And the smile on my face isn't really a smile at atll!

So I smoke a little too much, and I drink a little too much
And the tunes I request are not always the best
But the ones where the trumpets blare!

So I go at a maddening pace, and I pretend that it's taking
your place
But what else can you do, at the end of a love affair
