// I Only Have Eyes For You //

Are the stars out tonight?
I don't know if its cloudy or bright
Cause I only have eyes for you

The moon may be high
Maybe, millions of people go by
But I only have eyes for you

I don't know if were in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here, so am I

Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you

I don't know if were in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here, so am I

Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only got eyes, big bulging eyes
Great big eyes for you

// You Turned The Tables On Me //

You turned the tables on me
And now I'm falling for you
You turned the tables on me
I can't believe that it's true

I always thought when you brought
The lovely present you bought
Why hadn't you brought me more
But now if you'd come
I'd welcome anything
From the five and ten cent store

You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop
And now I'm out on my own
But after thinking it over and over
I got what was coming to me
Just like the sting of a bee
You turned the tables on me

You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop
And now I'm out on my own
But after thinking it over and over
I got what was coming to me
Just like the sting of a bee
You turned the tables on me

// Blue Moon //

Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart 
Without a love of my own 

Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

And then they suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper
Please adore me
And when I looked
The moon had turned to gold

Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart 
Without a love of my own 

Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

And then they suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper
Please adore me
And when I looked
The moon had turned to gold

Blue moon
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Blue moon

// Solitude //

In my solitude you haunt me
With reveries of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me
With memories that never die

I sit in my chair
Filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm prayin'
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

I sit in my chair
Filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm prayin'
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

// You'd Be So Easy To Love //

I know too well that I'm
Just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me

I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me just the same
I'm not entirely to blame for love

You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize all others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together that it does seem a shame
That you can't see your future with me
'Cause you'd be, oh, so easy to love

// You Go To My Head //

You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea
Casts a spell over me
Still I say to myself "Get a hold of yourself"
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head

// East Of The Sun (West Of The Moon) //

East of the sun,
And west of the moon,
We'll build a dream house
Of love, dear;

Near to the sun in the day,
Near to the moon at night;
We'll live in a lovely way dear,
Living on love and pale moonlight.

Just you and I, forever and a day;
Love will not die, we'll keep it that way.

Up among the stars we'll find
A harmony of life, too lovely, too.
East of the sun and west of the moon, dear,
East of the sun and west of the moon.

Just you and I, forever and a day;
Love will not die, we'll keep it that way.

Up among the stars we'll find
A harmony of life, too lovely, too.
East of the sun, and west of the moon, dear,
East of the sun, and west of the moon.
