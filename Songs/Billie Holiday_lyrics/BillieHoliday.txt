// Love For Sale //

When the only sound on the empty street
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet
That belong to a lonesome cop
I open shop
When the moon so long has been gazing down
On the wayward ways of this wayward town
That her smile becomes a smirk
I go to work

Love for sale
Appetizing, young love for sale.
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled. 
Love that's only slightly soiled.
Love for sale.
Who will buy?
Who will like to sample my supply?
Who's prepared to pay the price 
For a trip to paradise?
Love for sale.
Let the poets pipe of love 
In their childish way.
I know every type of love 
Better far than they.
If you want the thrill of love 
I've been through the mill of love.
Old love. New love. 
Every love, but true love.

Love for sale.
Appetizing young love for sale.
If you want to buy my wares, 
Follow me and climb the stairs.
Love for sale.

Love for sale

// Moonglow //

It must have been moonglow
Way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow
That led me straight to you

I still hear you saying
"Dear one, hold me fast"
And I start in praying
Oh Lord, please let this last

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from ev'ry where
And now when there's moonglow
Way up in the blue
I always remember that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow
Way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow
That led me straight to you

I still hear you saying
"Dear one, hold me fast"
And I start in praying
Oh Lord, please let this last

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from ev'ry where
And now when there's moonglow
Way up in the blue
I always remember that moonglow brought me you

// If The Moon Turns Green //

If the moon turns green
And shadows get up and walk around
Clouds come tumbling to the ground
I wouldn't be surprised
As didn't you fall in love with me

If the stars turn blue
And willows that weep began to sing
Winter changes into spring
I wouldn't raise my eyes
'Cause didn't you fall in love with me

I thought I was foolish to think of romance
With someone as charming as you
I thought I was hoping without any chance
Then every hope came true

If the moon turns green
And rivers began to flow upstream
This is all a crazy dream
I wouldn't be surprised
Anything can happen
If you can fall in love with me

I thought I was foolish to think of romance
With someone as charming as you
I thought I was hoping without any chance
Then every hope came true

If the moon turns green
And rivers began to flow upstream
This is all a crazy dream
I wouldn't be surprised
'Cause anything can happen
If you can fall in love with me

// Autumn In New York //

Autumn in New York, why does it seem so inviting?
Autumn in New York, it spells the thrill of first-nighting.
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds in canyons of steel; 
they're making me feel: I'm home.

It's autumn in New York that brings the promise of new love. 
Autumn in New York is often mingled with pain.
Dreamers with empty hands may sigh for exotic lands;
It's autumn in New York;
It's good to live it again.

Autumn in New York, the gleaming rooftops at sundown
Autumn in New York, it lifts you up when you're let down
jaded rouÃ©s and gay divorces who lunch at the Ritz 
will tell you that it's devine

It's autumn in New York transforms the slums into Mayfair
Autumn in New York, you'll need no castle in Spain
Lovers that bless the dark
On benches in Central Park
Greet autumn in New York,
It's good to live it again

// How Deep Is The Ocean? //

How can I tell you what is in my heart?
How can I measure each and every part?
How can I tell you how much I love you?
How can I measure just how much I do?

How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you
How much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
