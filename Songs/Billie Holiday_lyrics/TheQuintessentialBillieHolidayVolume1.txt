// What A Little Moonlight Can Do //

Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do to you

You're in love
Your heart's a flutter and all day long
You only shutter 
Cuz your poor tongue 
Just won't utter the words
I love you

Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Wait a while
Till a little moonbeam comes peepin' through

You'll get bold
You can't resist him
And all you'll say
When you have kissed him is

Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do

// I Wished On The Moon //

I wished on the moon, for something I never knew
I wished on the moon, for more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
On April days that would not dance away

I wished on the stars to throw me a beam or two
I begged of a stars and asked for a dream or two
I looked for every loveliness, it all came true
I wished on the moon for you

I wished on the moon, for something I never knew
I wished on the moon, for more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
On April days that would not dance away

I wished on a stars to throw me a beam or two
I begged of a stars and asked for a dream or two
I looked for every loveliness, it all came true
I wished on the moon, wished on the moon for you
I wished on the moon for you
