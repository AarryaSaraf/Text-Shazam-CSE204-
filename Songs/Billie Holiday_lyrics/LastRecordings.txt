// All Of You //

I love the looks of you, the lure of you
The sweet of you, the pure of you
The eyes, the arms, the mouth of you
The east, west, north, and the south of you

I'd love to gain complete control of you
And handle even the heart and soul of you
So love at least a small percent of me do
For I love all of you

I'd love to gain complete control of you
And handle even the heart and soul of you
So love at least a small percent of me do
For I love all of you
Of you
Of you
Of you

// Sometimes I'm Happy //

Sometimes I'm happy
Sometimes I'm blue
My disposition
Depends on you

I never mind
The rain from the skies
If I can find
The sun in your eyes

Sometimes I love you
Sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you
It's 'cause I love you

That's how I am
So what can I do
I'm happy when I'm with you

Sometimes I'm happy
Sometimes I'm blue
My disposition
Depends on you

I never mind
The rain from the skies
If I can find
The sun in your eyes

Sometimes I love you
Sometimes I hate you
But when I hate you
It's 'cause I love you

That's how I am
So what can I do
I'm happy when I'm with you
I'm happy when I'm with
I'm happy when I'm with
So happy when I'm with
I'm happy when I'm with you

// You Took Advantage Of Me //

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
'Cause you took advantage of me

I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So what's the use, you've cooked my goose
'Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know
My elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time you go
And much worse when you're near

Here am I with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
Lock all the doors and call me yours
'Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know
My elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time you go
And much worse when you're near

Here am I with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock all the doors and call me yours
'Cause you took advantage of me

// When It's Sleepy Time Down South //

Homesick, tired, all alone in a big city
Why should eveybody pity me?
Nighttime falling, and I'm yearning for Virginia
Hospitality within ya calls me

Pale moon shining on the fields below
Folks are crooning songs soft and low
Need not tell me so,
Because I know it's sleepy time down south

Softs winds blowing thru the pinewood trees
Folks down there live a life of ease
When the twilight brings the evening breeze
It's sleepy time down south
Steamboats on the river, a coming, a going
Splashing the night away

Hear those banjos ringing,
The folks are all singing
They dance till break of day
Dear old Southland with its dreamy songs
Takes back there where I belong
I'll find heaven in my mothers arms
When it's sleepy time down south

// There'll Be Some Changes Made //

They say don't change the old for the new
But I've found out that this will never do
When you grow old don't last long
You're here today and then tomorrow you're gone
I loved a man for many years gone by
I thought his love for me would never die
He made some changes that would never do
From now on I'm going to make some changes too
For there's a change in the weather
There's a change in the sea
So from now on there'll be in change in me
My walk will be different, my talk and my name
Nothin' about me is going to be the same
I'm goin' to change my wayof livin'
If that ain't enough
Then I'll change the way that I strut my stuff
'Cause nobody wants you when you're old and gray
There'll be some changes made today
There'll be some changes made

The say the old time things are the best
That may be very good for all the rest
But I'm goin'g let the old things be
'Cause they are certainly not suited for me
There was a time when I thought that way
That's why I'm all alone here today
Since every one these days seeks something new
From now on I'm goin' to seek some new things too
For there's a change in the fashion
Ask the femine folks
Even Jack Benny has changed jokes
I must make some changes from old to new
I must do things just the same as others do
I'm goin' to change my long, tall daddy for a little short fat
Goin' to change the number where I live at
I must have some lovin' or I'll fade away
There'll be some changes made today
There'll be some changes made today

// Deed I Do //

Do I want you
Oh my do I
Honey 'deed I do
Do I need you
Oh my do I
Honey 'deed I do

I'm glad that I'm the one who found you
That's why I'm always hanging around you
Do I love you
Oh my, do I
Baby 'deed I do

I'm glad that I'm the one who found you
That's why I'm always hanging around you
Do I love you
Oh my, do I
Baby 'deed I do

// Don't Worry 'Bout Me //

Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Just you forget about me
Be happy my love

Just say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day, the sensible way
And we'll remain friends

Look out for yourself
Should be the rule
Just give your heart and your love, to whom ever you love
Don't you be a fool

Baby why stop and cling, to some fading thing
That used to be
So if you can't forget
Don't you worry 'bout me

// All The Way //

When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you - all the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you - all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes - if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you - all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years - come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you - all the way, all the way

// Just One More Chance //

Just one more chance
To prove it's you alone I care for
Each night I say a little prayer for
Just one more chance

Just one more night
To taste the kisses that enchant me
I'd want no others if you'd grant me
Just one more chance

I've learned the meaning of repentance
Now you're the jury at my trial
I know that I should serve my sentence
Still I'm hoping all the while
You'll give me

Just one more word
I said that I was glad to start out
But now I'm back to cry my heart out
For just one more chance

I know that I should serve my sentence
Still I'm hoping all the while
You'll give me

Just one more word
I said that I was glad to start out
But now I'm back to cry my heart out
For just one more chance

// It's Not For Me To Say //

It's not for me to say you love me
It's not for me to say you'll always care
Oh, but here for the moment I can hold you fast
And press your lips to mine
And dream that love will last
As far as I can see this is heaven
And speaking just for me
It's ours to share
Perhaps the glow of love will grow
With every passing day
Or we may never meet again
But then, it's not for me to say

And speaking just for me
It's ours to share
Perhaps the glow of love will grow
With every passing day
Or we may never meet again
But then, it's not for me to say

// I'll Never Smile Again //

I'll never smile again
Until I smile at you
I'll never laugh again
What good would it do

For tears would fill my eyes
My heart would realize
That our romance is true

I'll never love again
I'm so in love with you
I'll never thrill again
To somebody new

Within my heart
I know I will never start
To smile again
Until I smile at you

Within my heart
I know I will never start
To smile again
Until I smile at you

// Baby Won't You Please Come Home //

Baby, won't you please come home
'Cause your mama's all alone?
I have tried in vain
Never no more to call your name

When you left, you broke my heart
Because I never thought we'd part
Every hour in the day, you will hear me say
"Baby, won't you please come home?"

Baby, won't you please come home
'Cause your mama's all alone?
I have tried in vain
Never no more to call your name

When you left, you broke my heart
Because I never thought we'd part
Every hour in the day, you will hear your mama say
"Oh baby, won't you please come on home?"

Mama needs daddy, hey baby
Won't you please come home?
