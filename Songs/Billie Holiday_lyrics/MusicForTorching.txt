// It Had To Be You //

It had to be you, it had to be you
I wandered around and finally found, that somebody 
Who could make me be true
Could make me be blue
And even be glad just to be sad, thinking of you

Some others I've seen might never be mean,
Might never be cross, or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do

For nobody else gave me a thrill 
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you,  wonderful you 
It had to be you 

It had to be you, it had to be you
I wandered around and finally found, that somebody 
Who could make me be true
Could make me be blue
And even be glad just to be sad, thinking of you

Some others I've seen might never be mean,
Might never be cross, or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do

For nobody else gave me a thrill 
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you,  wonderful you 
It had to be you

// Come Rain Or Come Shine //

I'm gonna love you
Like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain
And deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don' t ever bet me
Cause I'm gonna be true
If you let me

You're gonna love me
Like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
And won't it be fine

Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in, or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine

I'm gonna love you
Like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain
Deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
Cause I'm gonna be true
If you let me

You're gonna love me
Like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
And won't it be fine

Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in, or we're out of the money
But I'll love you always
I'm with you rain or shine

Rain or shine

// I Get A Kick Out Of You //

My story is much too sad to be told,
But practically ev'rything leaves me totally cold.
The only exception I know is the case
Where I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face.

I get no kick from champagne.
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?

Some get a kick from cocaine.
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrific'ly too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick ev'rytime I see
You're standing there before me.
I get a kick though it's clear to me
You obviously don't adore me.

I get no kick in a plane.
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

// I Don't Want To Cry Any More //

Each night, just about sunset
I watch you passing my door
It's all I can do
Not to run to you
'Cause I don't want to cry anymore

Nighttime, when there is moonlight
The same old moon I knew before
It's all I can do
Not to run to you
'Cause I don't want to cry anymore

All that I know about happiness
I found just being with you
Then I would find myself losing my mind
Over some careless thing you would do

Oh, why can't I forget you
I know so well what is in store
A moment or two
Up in the clouds with you
Then back where I was before

No I don't want to cry anymore
All that I've known about happiness
I found just being with you
Then I would find myself losing my mind
Over some careless thing you would do

Oh, why can't I forget you
I know so well what is in store
A moment or two
Up in the clouds with you
Then back where I was before

No I don't want to cry anymore

// I Don't Stand A Ghost Of A Chance With You //

I need your love so badly
I love you oh so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
I thought at last I found you
But other loves surround you
And I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
If you'd surrender
Just for a tender
Kiss or two
You might discover
That I'm the lover
Meant for you
And I'd be true
But what's the good of scheming
I'm dreaming
For I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you
'cause I don't stand
A ghost of a chance
With you

// Gone With The Wind //

Gone with the wind
Just like a leaf that has blown away
Gone with the wind
My romance has flown away

Yesterday's kisses are still on my lips
I had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips

Now all is gone
Gone is the rapture that filled my heart
Gone with the wind
The gladness that thrilled my heart

Just like a flame love burned brightly 
Then became an empty smoke dream
That has gone with the wind

// Isn't This A Lovely Day? //

The weather is frightening
The thunder and lighting
Seem to having their way
But as far as I'm concerned it's a lovely day

The change in the weather
Will keep us together
So as far as I'm concerned it's a lovely day
And every thing's OK

Isn't it a lovely day to be caught in the rain
You were going on your way now you have to remain

Just as you were leaving me (out to) (at) sea
The clouds broke and Oh what a break for me

I can see the sun up high though we're caught in a storm
I can see where you and I could be cozy and warm

Let the rain pitter-patter
cause it really doesn't matter
If skies are gray
Long as I can be you it's a lovely day
