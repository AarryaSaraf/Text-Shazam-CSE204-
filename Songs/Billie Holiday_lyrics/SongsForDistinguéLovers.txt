// Day In, Day Out //

Day in - day out
That same old voodoo follows me about
That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you
And baby I think of you
Day in and day out

Day out - day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake I get up with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain - come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips, and the pounding becomes
An oceans roar, a thousand drums
Can't you see it's love, can there be any doubt
When there it is, day in - day out

// A Foggy Day //

I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere

// Stars Fell On Alabama //

We lived our little drama.
We kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night.

I can't forget the glamour.
Your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night.

I never planned in my imagination
A situation so heavenly.
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center, just you and me, dear.

My heart beat like a hammer.
My arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night.

We lived our little drama.
We kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night.

I can't forget the glamour.
Your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night.

I never planned in my imagination
A situation so heavenly.
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center, just you and me, dear.

My heart beat like a hammer.
My arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night.

// One For My Baby //

It's quarter to three, there's no one in the place
Except you and me
So set 'em' up joe, I got a little story
I think you should know

We're drinking my friend, to the end
Of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

I know the routine, put another nickel
In the machine
I feel kind of bad, can't you make the music
Easy and sad

I could tell you a lot, but it's not
In a gentleman's code
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

You'd never know it, but buddy I'm a kind of poet
And I've got a lot of things I'd like to say
And if I'm gloomy, please listen to me
Till it's talked away

Well that's how it goes, and joe I know your gettin'
Anxious to close
Thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind
My bending your ear

But this torch that I found, it's gotta be drowned
Or it's gonna explode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

// Just One Of Those Things //

It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

So, goodbye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

So, goodbye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

// I Didn't Know What Time It Was //

Once I was young 
Yesterday, perhaps 
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps.
Once I was young,
But never was naive.
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve.
And now I know I was naive.

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you.
Oh, what a lovely time it was,
How sublime it was too!
I didn't know what time it was
You hold my hand.
Warm like the month of May it was,
And I'll say it was grand.

Grand to be alive, to be young,
To be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand to see your face, feel your touch,
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.

I didn't know what time it was
Live was no prize.
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes.
I'm wise,
And I know what time it is now.

Once I was old
Twenty years or so 
Rather well preserved:
The wrinkles didn't show.
Once I was old,
But not too old for fun.
I used to hunt for little girls
Up my immaginary gun.
But now I ain't for only one!

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you.
Oh, what a lovely time it was,
How sublime it was too!
I didn't know what time it was
You hold my hand.
Warm like the month of May it was,
And I'll say it was grand.

Grand to be alive, to be young,
To be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand to see your face, feel your touch,
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.

I didn't know what time it was
Live was no prize.
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes.
I'm wise,
And I know what time it is now.
