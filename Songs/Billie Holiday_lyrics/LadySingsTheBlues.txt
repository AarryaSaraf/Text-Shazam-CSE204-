Album: LadySingsTheBlues

// Lady Sings The Blues //

Lady sing the blues,
she's got them bad,
she feels so sad.

And wants the world to know,
just what her blues are all about,

Lady sings the blues,
She tells her side,
nothing to hide.

Now the world will know,
just what her blues is all about

The blues ain't nothin' like a pain in your heart,
when you get a bad start,
when you and your man have to part

I ain't gonna just sit around and cry,
i know i won't die,
'cause i love him

Lady sings the blues,
i'm tellin' you, she's got 'em bad,
but now the world will know,
she's never gonna sing them no more.

The blues ain't nothin' but a pain in your heart,
when you get a bad start,
when you and your man have to part

Ain't gonna just sit around and cry,
i know i won't die,
'cause i love him

Lady sings the blues,
i'm tellin' you, she's got them bad,
but now the world will know,
she's never gonna sing them no more.

// Trav'lin' Light //

I'm travellin' light
Because my man has gone
And from now on
I'm travellin' light
He said, "Goodbye"
And took my heart away
So from today
I'm travellin' light

No one to see
I'm free as the breeze
No one but me
And my memories
Some lucky night
He may come back again
But until then
I'm travellin' light

// I Must Have That Man! //

Don't want my mammy
I don't need a friend
My heart is broken
It won't ever mend
I ain't much carin'
Just where I will end
I must have that man

I'm like an oven
That's crying for heat
He treats me awfully
Each time that we meet
It's just unlawful
How that boy can cheat
But I must have that man

He's hot as Hades
A lady's not safe in his arms
When she's kissed
But I'm afraid that he's cooled off
And maybe I'm ruled off his list
I'll never be missed

I need that person much worse 'n just bad
I'm half alive and he's drivin' me mad
He's only human if he's to be had
I must have that man

// Strange Fruit //

Southern trees bear a strange fruit
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
Black bodies swinging in the Southern breeze
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees

Pastoral scene of the gallant South
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolias sweet and fresh
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh

Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the tree to drop
Here is a strange and bitter crop

// No Good Man //

No good man
Lovin' all the no good things
Never treats me as he should
That ain't no good
He's always bringing me down
He's no saint
Heaven knows that's what he ain't
Spends his money foolishly
Not on me
I'm the one who gets the run-around

I ought to hate him and yet I love him so
For I require
Love that's made of fire
And in his arms
I find
I always get that kind
No good man
Ever since the world began
There have been other fools like me
Born to be
In love with a no good man

// God Bless The Child //

Them that's got shall have
Them that's not shall lose
So the Bible said and it still is news
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own

Yes, the strong gets more
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own

Money, you've got lots of friends
They're crowding around your door
But when you're gone and spending ends
They don't come no more
Rich relations give crust of bread and such
You can help yourself, but don't take too much
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own

Money you've got lots of friends
They're crowding around your door
But when you're gone and spending ends
They don't come no more
Rich relations give crust of bread and such
You can help yourself, but don't take too much
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, that's got his own

Here just don't worry about nothing cause he's got his own
Yes, he's got his own

// Good Morning, Heartache //

Good morning, heartache, you ole gloomy sight
Good morning, heartache, thought we'd said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn
Wish I'd forget you
but you're here to stay
It seems I met you 
When my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning, heartache, what's new?

Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you, no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning, heartache, here we go again
Good morning, hearache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hangin around
Good morning, heartache, sit down

Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you, no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning, heartache, here we go again
Good morning, hearache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hangin around
Good morning, heartache, sit down

// Love Me Or Leave Me //

Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me and I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissin'
But night time is my time for reminiscin'
Regrettin' instead of forgettin' with somebody else

There'll be no one
Unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue

I want your love but I don't want to borrow
To have it today and give back tomorrow
Your love is my love, there's no love for nobody else

Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me and I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissin'
But night time is my time for reminiscin'
Regrettin' instead of forgettin' with somebody else

There'll be no one
Unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue

I want your love but I don't want to borrow
To have it today and give back tomorrow
Your love is my love, there's no love for nobody else

// Too Marvelous For Words //

You're just to marvelous
Too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous
And that old standby amorous

It's all too wonderful
I'll never find the phrase
That says enough, tells enough
I mean just aren't swell enough

You're much too much, and just too very very
To ever be, to ever be in the dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous
Too marvelous for words

// Willow Weep For Me //

Willow weep for me
Willow weep for me
Bent your branches down along the ground and cover me
Listen to my plea
Hear me willow and weep for me
Gone my lovely dreams
Lovely summer dreams
Gone and left me here
To weep my tears along the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me willow and weep for me
Whisper to the wind and say that love has sinned
To leave my heart a sign
And crying alone
Murmur to the night
Hide her starry light
So none will find me sighing
Crying all alone
Weeping willow tree
Weeping sympathy
Bent your branches down along the ground and cover me
Listen to me plead
Hear me willow and weep for me
Willow
Willow
Weep for me

// I Thought About You //

I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
A winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made, oh, I thought about you
When I pulled down the shade then I really felt blue
I peeked through the crack, looked at the track
The one going back to you
And what did I do? I thought about you
