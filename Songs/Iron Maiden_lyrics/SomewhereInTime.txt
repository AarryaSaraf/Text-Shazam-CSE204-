Album: SomewhereInTime

// Caught Somewhere In Time //

If you had the time to lose
An open mind and time to choose
Would you care to take a look
Or can you read me like a book?

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Can I tempt you, come with me
Be Devil may care, fulfill your dream
If I said I'd take you there
Would you go, would you be scared?

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Don't be afraid, you're safe with me
Safe as any soul can be honestly
Just let yourself go

Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh

Like a wolf in sheep's clothing
You try to hide your deepest sins
Of all the things that you've done wrong
And I know where you belong

Time is always on my side
Time is always on my side

Make you an offer you can't refuse
You've only got your soul to lose
Eternally... let yourself go!

Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time... oh oh
Caught somewhere in time
Caught somewhere in time
Caught now in two minds!

// Wasted Years //

From the coast of gold across the seven seas
I'm travellin' on far and wide
But now it seems
I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do
It isn't me but someone else

I close my eyes, and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is
You never miss it 'til it's gone away
And my heart is lying there
And will be 'til my dying day

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realise you're living in the golden years

Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain so easily
When you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry
And throw my hands up to the sky

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realise you're living in the golden years

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realise you're living in the golden years

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realise you're living in the golden years

// Sea Of Madness //

Out in the street somebody's crying
Out in the night the fires burn
Maybe tonight somebody's crying
Reached the point of no return
Oh – my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh – my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave

Like the eagle and the dove
Fly so high on wings above
When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness
Out on the sea of madness

Somewhere I hear a voice that's calling
Out in the dark there burns a dream
You got to hope when you are falling
To find the world that you have seen
Oh – my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh – my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave

Like the eagle and the dove
Fly so high on wings above
When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness
Out on the sea of madness

It's madness
The sun don't shine
On the sea of madness
There ain't no wind to fill your sails
Madness when all you see can only bring you sadness
On towards the sea we go

Out in the night somebody's crying
Out in the night the fires burn
Maybe tonight somebody's crying
Reached the point of no return
Oh – my eyes they see but I can't believe
Oh – my heart is heavy as I turn my back and leave

Like the eagle and the dove
Fly so high on wings above
When all you see can only bring you sadness
Like a river we will flow
On towards the sea we go
When all you do can only bring you sadness
Out on the sea of madness
Of madness
Of madness
Of madness
Of madness
Of madness
Of madness

// Heaven Can Wait //

Can't understand what is happening to me
This isn't real, this is only a dream
But I never have felt, no I never have felt this way before
I'm looking down on my body below
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream
Is it now could it be that the angel of death has come for me?

I can't believe that really my time has come
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away

Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day

I have a lust for the Earth below
And Hell itself is my only foe
'Cause I've no fear of dying, I'll go when I'm good and ready
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed
At all of the people standing there in front of me
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led
Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare

Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day

Take my hand, I'll lead you to the promised land
Take my hand, I'll give you immortality
Eternal youth, I'll take you to the other side
To see the truth, the path for you is decided

Oh oh

My body tingles, I feel so strange
I feel so tired, I feel so drained
And I'm wondering if I'll ever be the same again
Is this in limbo or Heaven or Hell?
Maybe I'm going down there as well
I can't accept my soul will drift forever
I feel myself floating back down to Earth
So could this be the hour of my rebirth?
Or have I died or will I wake from dreaming?

Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait
Heaven can wait 'til another day

// The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner //

Tough of the track with the wind
And the rain that's beating down on your back
Your heart's beating loud
And goes on getting louder
And goes on even more till the sound is ringing in your head
With every step you tread and every breath you take

Determination makes you run, never stop
Gotta win, gotta run till you drop
Keep the pace, hold the race
Your mind is getting clearer
You're over halfway there
But the miles, they never seem to end
As if you're in a dream, not getting anywhere
It seems so futile

Run, on and on
Run, on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner

I've got to keep running the course
I've got to keep running and win at all costs
I've got to keep going, be strong
Must be so determined and push myself on

Run over stiles, across fields
Turn to look at who's on your heels
Way ahead of the field
The line is getting nearer
But do you want the glory that goes?
You reach the final stretch, ideals are just a trace
You feel like throwing the race
It's all so futile

Run, on and on
Run, on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner
Run, on and on
Run, on and on
The loneliness of the long distance runner

// Stranger In A Strange Land //

Was many years ago that I left home and came this way
I was a young man, full of hopes and dreams
But now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained
Sometimes things ain't what they seem
No brave new world, no brave new world
No brave new world, no brave new world

Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky
My spirit wanders endlessly
Until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why
Hear me calling, rescue me
Set me free, set me free
Lost in this place, and leave no trace

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped into this prison, yea
Lost and far from home

One hundred years have gone and men again
They came that way
To find the answer to the mystery
They found his body lying where it fell on that day
Preserved in time for all to see
No brave new world, no brave new world
Lost in this place, and leave no trace

What became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home

What became of the man that started
All are gone and their souls departed
Left me here in this place
So all alone

Stranger in a strange land
Land of ice and snow
Trapped inside this prison
Lost and far from home

Stranger in a strange land

// Deja-Vu //

When you see familiar faces
But you don't remember where they're from
Could you be wrong?

When you've been particular places
That you know you've never been before
Can you be sure?

'Cause you know this has happened before
And you know that this moment in time is for real
And you know when you feel deja-vu

Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before

Ever had a conversation
That you realise you've had before?
Isn't it strange?

Have you ever talked to someone
And you feel you know what's coming next?
It feels pre-arranged

'Cause you know that you've heard it before
And you feel that this moment in time is surreal
'Cause you know when you feel deja-vu

Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before
Feel like I've been here before

// Alexander The Great //

"My son, ask for thyself another kingdom
For that which I leave is too small for thee"
[King Philip of Macedonia – 339 B.C.]

Near to the east
In a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son
To Philip of Macedon
The legend, his name was Alexander

At the age of nineteen
He became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegean Sea
In 334 B.C
He utterly beat the armies of Persia

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a legend amongst mortal men

King Darius the third
Defeated fled Persia
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell
To the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria

By the Tigris river
He met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis, the capital of Persia

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a god amongst mortal men

A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia

Hellenism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity
Marching on, marching on

The battle-weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
He died of fever in Babylon
