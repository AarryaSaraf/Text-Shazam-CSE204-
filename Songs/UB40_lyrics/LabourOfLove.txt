// Keep On Moving //

[Chorus:]
Lord I gotta keep on moving.
Lord I gotta get on down.
Lord I gotta keep on moving.
Where I can't be found
Law is coming after me.

I've been accused of a killing
Lord knows I didn't do
For hanging me they are willing yeah
That's why I gotta get on through.
Law is coming after me.

[Chorus]

I've got two boys and a woman
They're just gonna suffer now.
Lord forgive me for not going back
But I'll be there anyhow,
I'll be there anyhow.

[Chorus]

Now maybe someday I'll find a piece of land
Somewhere not by or near anyone.
Then I'll send for my love, love, love sweet woman.
And my two grown up son's,
My two grown up sons.

[Chorus]

// Please Don't Make Me Cry //

You say you are going to leave me
I'm begging you to stay
My baby I can't get through any way
No I can't
And when I wake up in the morning
You are gone
Little pretty thing
You know I'll be all alone

[Chorus:]
You'll hear me crying (mmmmmmm)
Please don't make me cry (mmm mmmm)
'cos I can't say good-bye (mmmmm)
Please don't make me cry
Because I know
There will be nothing left for me

All them good good times
We spent together
You said it was me and no other (yeah)
And now you want to make me pain inside
Darlin' I Know you are going to make me cry

[Chorus]

All this pain I can't stand it
You're going to leave
You're going to leave this poor man on his own
Yes you are (mmmmm)

[Chorus]

All this pain I can't stand it
You're going to leave
You're going to leave this poor man on his own
Yes you are
Please don't make me cry
Baby I'm Pleading

// Sweet Sensation //

I can feel those thrill's walking over
When you hold me tight
Now I feel those pains aching over
When you say goodnight

[Chorus:]

Oh what sweet sensation
Lord what strange devotion
You've got love and devotion
And I won't forget your charm

Now there's nothing left for me to say girl
But stay in your world
You've got so much soul deep inside girl
And love that's richer than gold

[Repeat chorus to fade]

// Johnny Too Bad //

Walking down the road
With a pistol in your waist
Johnny you're too bad
Walking down the road
With a ratchet in your waist
Johhny you're too bad

[Chorus:]
You're just robbin' and stabbin'
And lootin' and shooting
You're too bad repeat

One of these day's
When you hear a voice say come,
Where you gonna run to?
One of these day's
When you hear a voice say come,
where you gonna run to?

[Chorus]

You're gonna run to the rock
For rescue, there'll be no rock
You're gonna run to the rock
For rescue, there'll be no rock

// Guilty //

Well hello baby
Come sit down, make your self comfortable
Tell me somthing, how long have we known each other?
About ten months huh?
Say what's that on your finger? An engagement ring?
So you and John are getting engaged, huh?
You know he's a mighty lucky guy
Should be proud to have a woman like you
Listen, I've got something to tell you
Don't think I'm getting fresh or anything like that
But this things been bugging me for a long time you know
And its getting heavier each and every day
And I've just gotta get it off my chest
See I've never seen anyone like you
I've never known anyone like you
Let me take me back to my childhood a while
See we had a medium size family you know, we weren't rich
But my mother tried to bring us the best she could
Didn't commit no crime nor nothing
But I had to reach manhood to commit this crime
According to the code of love, if there is such a code
See love is a thing well, you know?
It's a bit like quicksand
The more you wriggle the deeper you sink
And when it hits you you've just got to fall
That's why I do believe that I am guilty
Guilty of loving you

// She Caught The Train //

Another night of loneliness.
My love is gone
She made a fuss and she was wrong,
yet she is gone

I asked her friends if they'd seen her
They said she'd take the train
I ran to catch the train,
Oh my, the train is gone

Another night of loneliness.
My love is gone
She made a fuss and she was wrong,
yet she is gone

I ran to catch the train,
Oh my, the train is gone

// Version Girl //

[Chorus:]
Version Girl, what's your name?
Oh you come and you go,
Version Girl, what's your name?
Just like the morning sun.
It's so hard to find a personality with charms like yours for me.

oo-ee oo-ee oo-ee

Version girl, what's your name?
Don't you know I long to say.
Version Girl, what's your name?
It's so hard to find a personality with charms like yours for me

oo-ee oo-ee oo-ee

I sit in the sun waiting for you to come along
So my heart will be satisfied
So please let me be your number one
Under the moon, under the stars and under the sun.

[Chorus]

oo-ee oo-ee oo-ee

[Talking:]
Version girl, whats's you name?
Oh you come ....... etc

oo-ee oo-ee oo-ee

I sit in the sun waiting for you to come along
So my heart will be satisfied
So please let me be your number one
Under the moon, under the stars and under the sun.

[Chorus]

// Many Rivers To Cross //

Many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost as I travel along
The white cliffs of Dover
Many rivers to cross and it's only my will
That keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years and,
I merely survive because of my pride.

And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My woman left and she didn't say why
Well I guess, I gotta try.
Many rivers to cross but where to begin,
I'm playing for time
There'll be times when I find myself thinking
Of committing some dreadful crime.

I've got many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost as I travel along
The white cliffs of Dover
Many rivers to cross and it's only my will
That keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years and,
I merely survive because of my pride.
