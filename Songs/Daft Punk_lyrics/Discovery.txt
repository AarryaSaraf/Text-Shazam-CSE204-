// Digital Love //

Last night I had a dream about you
In this dream I'm dancing right beside you
And it looked like everyone was having fun
the kind of feeling I've waited so long

Don't stop, come a little closer
As we jam the rhythm gets stronger
There's nothing wrong with just a little, little fun
We were dancing all night long

The time is right
To put my arms around you
You're feeling right
You wrap your arms around too
But suddenly I feel the shining sun
Before I knew it this dream was all gone

Oh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
I wish this dream comes true

Oh, I don't know what to do
About this dream and you
We'll make this dream come true

Why don't you play the game?
Why don't you play the game?

// Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger //

Work it, make it, do it, makes us

Ever, after, work is over

// Superheroes //

Something's in the air...

// Something About Us //

It might not be the right time
I might not be the right one
But there's something about us I want to say
Cause there's something between us anyway

I might not be the right one
It might not be the right time
But there's something about us I've got to do
Some kind of secret I will share with you

I need you more than anything in my life
I want you more than anything in my life
I'll miss you more than anyone in my life
I love you more than anyone in my life

// Face To Face //

What's going on? Could this be my understanding?
It's not your fault I was being too demanding
I must admit it's my pride that made me distant
All because I hoped that you'd be someone different

There's not much I know about you
Fear will always make you blind
But the answer is in clear view
It's amazing what you'll find face to face

I turned away 'cause I thought you were the problem
Tried to forget until I hit the bottom
But when I faced you in my blank confusion
I realized you weren't wrong, it was a mere illusion

It really didn't make sense
Just to leave this unresolved
It's not hard to go the distance
When you finally get involved face to face

It really didn't make sense
Just to leave this unresolved
It's not hard to go the distance
When you finally get involved face to face
