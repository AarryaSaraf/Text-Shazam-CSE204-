// The Game Of Love //

There is a game of love
There is a game of love
This is a game of love
This is a game of love
And it was you
And it was you the one that would be breaking my heart
When you decided to walk away
When you decided to walk away
The one that would be breaking my heart
When you decided to walk away
When you decided to walk away

There is a game of love
There is a game of love
This is a game of love
This is a game of love
And it was you
And it was you the one that would be breaking my heart
When you decided to walk away
When I wanted you to stay

And it was you
I just wanted you to stay
Me, I just wanted you to stay
Me, I just wanted you to stay

// Giorgio By Moroder //

When I was fifteen, sixteen, when I really started to play guitar, I definitely wanted to become a musician.

It was almost impossible because it was— The dream was so big that I didn't see any chance because I was living in a little town, was studying.

And when I finally broke away from school and became musician, I thought, "Well, now, I may have a little bit of a chance." Because all I really wanted to do is music and not only play music but compose music.

At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70, they had already discotheques. So, I would take my car, would go to a discotheque, sing maybe thirty minutes.I think I had about 7-8 songs.

I would partially sleep in the car because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about—almost two years to survive, in the beginning,

I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s, the sounds of the '60s, of the '70s, and then have a sound of the future. And I said, "Wait a second. I know the synthesizer. Why don't I use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future?"

And I didn't have any idea what to do but I knew I needed a click. So, we put a click on the 24-track which then was synced to the Moog modular. I knew that it could be a sound of the future but I didn't realize how much the impact would be.

My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio.

Once you free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being correct, you can do whatever you want. So, nobody told me what to do and there was no preconception of what to do.

// Within //

There are so many things that I don't understand
There's a world within me that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
I am lost, I can't even remember my name

I've been, for sometime, looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
[2x]

There are so many things that I don't understand
There's a world within me that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
(where are the locks to try the key?)
I am lost, I can't even remember my name
(and I wonder why)

I've been, for sometime, looking for someone
I need to know now
Please tell me who I am
[4x]

// Instant Crush //

I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take

One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
I don't believe in him—his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the "Roche"
But no one gives us any time anymore

He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said

"I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore, oh, oh, oh

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend

Some more again

It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissors at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall
One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold
Take it, I don't wanna sing anymore

"I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine"
I didn't want to anymore, oh, oh, oh

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door...

I don't understand, don't get upset
I'm not with you
We're swimming around,
It's all I do, when I'm with you

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

And we will never be alone again
'Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
'Cause I know it unlocks like a door

// Lose Yourself To Dance //

I know you don't get a chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping
Here take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe up all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance

Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance
Lose yourself to dance

Lose yourself to dance (come on)
Lose yourself to dance (at all)

Everybody dancing on the floor
Getting you ready for some more
Everybody on the floor

// Touch //

Touch
Touch, I remember touch
Touch
Touch, I remember touch
Where do I belong?
Touch
I need something more
I remember touch
I need something more in my life

Touch
I remember touch
Pictures came with touch
A painter in my mind
Tell me what you see

A tourist in a dream
A visitor it seems
A half-forgotten song
Where do I belong?
Tell me what you see
I need something more

Kiss
Suddenly alive
Happiness arrive
Hunger like a storm
How do I begin?

A room within a room
A door behind a door
Touch, where do you lead?
I need something more
Tell me what you see
I need something more

Home, hold on
If love is the answer, you're home
Hold on
If love is the answer, you're home
Hold on
If love is the answer, you're home
Hold on
If love is the answer, you're home
Hold on
If love is the answer, you're home
Hold on
If love is the answer, you're home
Hold on
If love is the answer, you're home
Hold on
If love is the answer, you're...

Touch
Sweet touch
You've given me too much to feel
Sweet touch
You've almost convinced me I'm real

I need something more
I need something more

// Get Lucky //

Like the legend of the Phoenix
All ends with beginnings
What keeps the planets spinning (uh)
The force from the beginning

(Look)

We've come too far to give up who we are
So let's raise the bar and our cups to the stars

She's up all night to the sun
I'm up all night to get some
She's up all night for good fun
I'm up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to the sun

If you wanna leave I'm with it (ah)

We've come too far to give up who we are

// Beyond //

Dream,
Beyond dreams
Beyond life you will find your song
Before sound, to be found close your eyes
And rise higher, still endless thrill
To the land of love
Beyond love
Come alive,
Angel eye
Forever watching you and I

You are the night, you are the ocean
You are the light behind the cloud
You are the end and the beginning
A world where time is not allowed

There's no such thing as competition
To find our way we lose control
Remember – love's our only mission
This is the journey of the soul

The perfect song is framed with silence
It speaks of places never seen
Your home's a promise long forgotten
It is the birthplace of your dreams

// Fragments Of Time //

Driving this road down to paradise
Letting the sun light into my eyes
Our only plan is to improvise
And it's crystal clear
That I don't ever want it to end
If I had my way I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go 
These moments will shine

Familiar faces I've never seen
Living the gold and the silver dream
Making me feel like I'm seventeen
And it's crystal clear
That I don't ever want it to end
If I had my way I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay

I'll just keep playing back
These fragments of time
Everywhere I go 
These moments will shine

// Doin' It Right //

Doing it right
Everybody will be dancing
And we'll be feeling it right
Everybody will be dancing
And be doing it right
Everybody will be dancing
When we're feeling all right
Everybody will be dancing tonight
[x6]

If you do it right
Let it go all night
Shadows on you break
Out into the light
[x2]

If you lose your way tonight
That's how you know the magic's right

Doing it right
Everybody will be dancing
And we'll be feeling it right
Everybody will be dancing
And be doing it right
Everybody will be dancing
When we're feeling all right
Everybody will be dancing tonight...

If you do it right
Let it go all night
Shadows on you break
Out into the light
[x2]

If you lose your way tonight
That's how you know the magic's right
[x2]

If you do it right
Let it go all night
Shadows on you break
Out into the light
[x4]

If you lose your way tonight
That's how you know the magic's right

Hey Bob I'm looking at what Jack was talking about and it's definitely not a particle that's nearby. It is a bright object and it's obviously rotating because it's flashing, it's way out in the distance, certainly rotating in a very rhythmic fashion because the flashes come around almost on time. As we look back at the earth it's up at about 11 o'clock, about maybe ten or twelve diameters. I don't know whether that does you any good, but there's something out there.

I was crossing the border
Two old friend coincidence

Two old friend coincidences

Weekday

Two old friend coincidences

Forks inside my head
Dinner's at mine or yours

// The Writing Of Fragments Of Time //

Keep building those (keep building those, yeah)
Random memor-
I would never leave
Keep building those random memories (so)
(So you know this song is about Todd coming here, and)
(And, and making the song, and, and uh, working with us)

(I would never leave)
(Keep building these random memories)
Ha ha, good, we're almost there with this part!
I knew the beginning was the hardest part, it was like working like-

I would never leave
Keep building these random memories, oh

'Cause wait, that-, this is the thing
"Since I can't", it's gonna be like, "But since-"
Something about it, having to stop
The way I'll get around that is by going back to these, yes
("I'll keep playing back these fragments of time")
Yeah, exactly, these fragments, that's how it's gonna be

(These fragments)
(These fragments of time)

(I just keep playing back)
(These fragments of time) Fragments of time
(Fragments of time)
Wait, do me a favor, I don't mean to cut you, because we're-, I'm almost
I just wanna hear the-, before the "way, I would never-"

Way

I don't ever want it to end
If I had my way, I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Before it's too late
Okay, so that's the part, I have to just remember that
I mean

Okay, alright, so, um
So the thing of it is "I can't-", "I can't stay"
But it's like, the whole concept is "I can't stay"
(But things-, it comes to an end)
(But since everything comes, you know-) Yeah, yeah, "but since everything come-"
(Since everything) Oh wait, hold on, yeah

(I don't know if it's you that "can't stay") I know, but-

And I don't ever want it to end
(If I had my way, I would never leave)
(Keep building these random memories)
(Since I can't stay)
(I'll just keep playing back)
That's good, that's good, yeah
(These fragments of time)

You think the line should- um, like, I think this will be a good thing
Should the line reflect that it can't stay the same?
Like, in other words, I wish that it could always remain today, like, type of thing?
Like, should it be that?
That might help in writing it, like, in other words, you know

(Keep building these random memories)
(Turning your days into melodies) That's so sweet, that this is-
(But since I can't stay) "Turning your days into melodies", wait, okay
If I had my way, I would never leave
Keep building these random memories
Turning our days into melodies
But since I can't stay (woohoo!)

(If I had my way, I would never leave)
(Keep building these random memories)
(Turning our days into melodies)
But since I can't stay

(I think that sometimes the hard thing is just finding the melody)
(And now we have the melody for the second part of the verse) Yeah, yeah, exactly
(Which can just like, write another thing) Yeah, exactly, yeah, exactly! For the second-
(If we do that, it just becomes two verse) Yeah, exactly
(Or if we-, if we-)
(Or, if we really struggle, it can just become our second verse, you know) Exactly
(It's more like a backup plan, y'know?) Exactly, yeah-, yeah, exactly
And plus, the idea is that you can even, you know, for the second verse
Kinda sing it like this, but change some of it, like, you know, improvise like-
"If I can't-", you know, it's like-, you know, like)
(But if there's no way, or, you know, I'll just keep playing that)
Yeah, yeah, like-, exactly, yeah (I'll find a way, uh, you know)

Whatever the case, we'll find a breakthrough (Yeah, but if not-)
(I agree, I agree, let's imagine that we do)

There's so many di-, so many possibilities, uh, like, for it to be rhymed very easily, um
Faces I've never seen (Fantasy? We're doing that to another song)
I didn't say "fantasy", I said, I said, uh (Oh, you didn't say-)
Faces that I've seen in dre- (Oh, sorry)
Seen and dreamed, like, in other words, like

(Oh) You know, it's like, I don't know-
("Familiar faces I've never seen") Yeah, familiar faces I've never seen
(Instead of doing "unfamiliar faces" that seems like, it's still "familiar faces I've never seen", you know?)
I love it, that's so crazy
Familiar faces I've never seen (that's good, right?)
"In memories, I found my dream", or like-
(Familiar faces I've never seen)
Oh my God, that's such a beautiful line, "familiar faces I've never seen". I love it!

(Familiar faces I've never seen)
(Turning this straight out of a dream)
Like, you know, a half-remembered dream, or something like-
(There's something like that in "Touch", he said that) Oh, really?
(Yeah) That's crazy, I did not-, I didn't pick that up, that's like-
(A half-remembered song, yeah) Wow, that's crazy
No, I know, but I swear, I didn't-, but like that just came up-
No, but the connection is just like, it's crazy
(That "seen and dream", that's cool, it's cool too) Yeah, yeah, ye-
(Dream, been) Yeah, yeah
(A dream within a dream, it's in "Touch" too) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(There's the word "dream" everywhere) Yeah, so which is fine
And it kinda of has a connection to it, like the congruency, yeah

That "familiar faces" line, man, that's-, that's hot
To be able to express something so great, and, like
It's almost like a haiku, because it's like-, you know what I mean?
You only have a few syllables to say something and it's like-
(But that's totally the-, my alley of like the, California vibes, you know?) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Familiar faces I've never seen
You know, I didn't say-, I'm actually, it's-
There's some parts I'm getting choked up 'cause it's so damn emotional, just putting these 3 weeks into words, it's really intense, actually
I've never felt anything like this before (Now every time you hear this song, it's gonna-)
Yeah, seriously, it's insane, yeah (it's capturing it, it's making it forever)
