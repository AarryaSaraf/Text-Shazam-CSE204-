// Feathers-Oars-Blades //

Bare in foot and hide
Barefaced bareheaded
Bare in foot and hide
Bare in foot and hide

Crestfallen, weeping
The cripples though crestless
Are crestfallen weeping

Feathers oar blades
Splitting hair feathers
Spitting out oar blades
Spitting out oar blades

Crestfallen, weeping
The cripples though crestless
Are crestfallen weeping

All in teetotum
Widdershins every's body
Is all in teetotum
Is all in teetotum

Spitting out oar blades
Spitting out oar blades
Spitting out oar blades
Spitting out oar blades
Spitting out oar blades
Spitting out oar blades
Spitting out oar blades
Spitting out oar blades
Spitting out oar blades
Spitting out oar blades
Spitting out oar blades
Spitting out oar blades
Spitting out
Spitting out

// Alas Dies Laughing //

Flaxen, the dress is born
Crush a crushing stone
Tie a starching walls
Wake takes a mumbling form
Wake takes a mumbling form

Flaxen, the dress is old
Fingers, this dress is tied
Tie a starching walls
Wake takes a mumbling form

Wake takes a mumbling form
Wake takes a mumbling form
Wake takes a mumbling form
Wake takes a mumbling form
Wake takes a mumbling form
Wake takes a mumbling form

Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a

Wake takes a mumbling form
Wake takes a mumbling form

Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a
Wake takes a

It's all for my

Barking, biting amongst ourselves...

It's all but an, all but an ark lark

It's all for my
All for my
All of my
All of my
Charisma

Charisma

It's all for my
All for my

He's mocking both my lullabies...

It's all but an ark lark
It's all but an ark lark
It's all but an ark lark

Off in my
Off in my
Off in my
Off in my
