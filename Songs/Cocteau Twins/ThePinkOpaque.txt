// Wax And Wane //

Carrying prose
Broke my real friend
The devil bites dirty
We wax and we wane
The devil bites dirty
We wax and wane
[x4]
Licking our wounds
The devil bites dirty
Rattling we'll taste
We wax and we wane
The devil bites dirty
We wax and wane
[x4]
Caring is a bury gin shot
The devil bites dirty
Up 'till the wee wanes
Oh, we laugh in their faces
The devil bites dirty
We wax and wane
[x8]

// Musette And Drums //

Did it again
Real fast for a genius
Meridienne
Were genius too, ah
Writes a song
Their favourite genius
Somebody's 
She turned thirteen oh

Tragedienne
Am I pretty enough

Musette and drums
I'm also genius
Somebody's 
She turned thirteen oh

Writes a song
Their favourite genius
Somebody's
She turned thirteen oh

Tragedienne
Am I pretty enough

Musette and drums
They are genius too

// Lorelei //

Get off the car
Kick his chain
Kick his pride, get him soaked, hit, run
Lift up your toes
In my mouth
And we can make love
And we can go

And we can go
And we can go
We're covered by the sacred fire
When you come to me, you come to broke

Get off the car
Kick his chain
Kick his pride, get him soaked, hit, run
Lift up your toes in my mouth
And we can make love
And we can go

And we can go
And we can go
And we can go
And we can go
We're covered by the sacred fire
When you come to me, you come to broke

Without a doubt 
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without
Without a doubt 
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt

We're covered by the sacred fire
When you come to me, you come to me broke
Guilty girl, guilty boy
Get to make out, him chocked with mousse
Lift up your toes in my mouth
And we can make love
And we can go
Guilty girl, guilty boy
Get to make out, him chocked with mousse
Lift up your toes in my mouth
And we can make love
And we can go

// The Spangle Maker //

He's the droplets
He's that droplet on my truth
He's the spangle
He is that spangle maker

Oh, for that's
Awful that worked it shattering heads
She is his
She's his spangle baby
And the rest made sure it's the droplet

Singing
Broke and winded
Broke and winded
Whistling

Singing
Broke and winded
Broke and winded
Whistling

He's the droplets
He's that droplet on my truth
He's the spangle
He is that spangle maker
And the rest made sure it's the droplet

Singing
Broke and winded
Broke and winded
Whistling

Singing
Broke and winded
Broke and winded
Whistling

He's the droplets
He's that droplet on my truth
He's the spangle
He is that spangle maker
And the rest made sure it's the droplet

Singing
Broke and winded
Broke and winded
Whistling

Singing
Broke and winded
Broke and winded
Whistling

He's the droplets
He's that droplet on my truth
He's the spangle
He is that spangle maker

His part of the plan, it hadn't gone and there you are
It scattered then, it didn't bond and there you are
Oh, perhaps it's just the droplet singing
Broke and winded, I whistle and there you hide

His part of the plan, it hadn't gone and there you are
It scattered then, it didn't bond and there you are
Oh, perhaps it's just the droplet singing
Broke and winded, I whistle and there you hide

His part of the plan, it hadn't gone and there you are
It scattered then, it didn't bond and there you are
Oh, perhaps it's just the droplet singing
Broke and winded, I whistle and there you hide

// Millimillenary //

Milli- milli- millenary
Just waits for you to hurt her
Pandora missed her shot

While you did, she was aimed and did
Pandora missed her shot
Just waits for you to hurt her

Milli- milli- millenary
She's wearing shades of brown
Pandora masked her shard of

Milli- milli- millenary
Just waits for you to hurt her

Pandora missed her shot
Just waits for you to hurt her

Milli- milli- millenary

// Hitherto //

Hidden to your heavy side 
I couldn't tell your head is so deep
Hidden to her own hidden account 
I must have let her dame holes

Hidden to your heavy side 
I couldn't tell your head is so deep
Hidden to her own hidden account 
I must have let her dame holes

Hidden to your heavy side 
I couldn't tell your head is so deep

I must have let her dame holes

Hidden to your heavy side 
I couldn't tell your head is so deep
Hidden to her own hidden account

// From The Flagstones //

At times I've seen you from the oriel
At times I've seen you from the flagstones

At times I've seen you from the balustrade
At times I've seen you from the flagstones
Another flaw, another knothole
You can cajole
And can cajole...

At times I've seen you from the oriel
At times I've seen you from the flagstones
Another flaw, another knothole
You may cajole
You may cajole...

At times I've seen you from the balustrade
At times I've seen you from the flagstones
At times I've seen you from the balustrade

It's so good to have a man
It's so good to have him check him out
Saliva peeks from his trail
I gained a lot of advice from him

It's so good to have a man
It's so good to have him check him out
Saliva peeks from his trail
I gained a lot of advice from him

Oh, please
Please
It's so good to have a man
It's so good to have him check him out
At night
Oh, please
Please
It's so good to have a man
It's so good to have him check him out

When he pushes her back
Like he's gonna have to make me
Saliva peeks from his trail
I gained a lot of advice from him
It's so good to have a man
It's so good to have him check him out
Saliva peeks from his trail
I gained a lot of advice from him

When he pushes her back
Like he's gonna have to make me
Saliva peeks from his trail
I gained a lot of advice from him
It's so good to have a man
It's so good to have him check him out
Saliva peeks from his trail
I gained a lot of advice from him

Oh, please

When he pushes her back
Like he's gonna have to make me
Please
Please
It's so good to have a man
It's so good to have him check him out
My love

// Pepper-Tree //

Gotta, gotta, gotta gain his voice
On pepper tree
Harden, harden, harden dont's and wont's
My easel she

You gotta, gotta, gotta gain his voice
On purple scotch
Harden, harden, harden dont's and wont's
My easel touch

Gain his voice
On pepper tree
Heart's been swallowed whole
Who's real muse and she

You gotta, gotta, gotta gain his voice
On purple scotch
Harden, harden, harden dont's and wont's
My easel touch

Gain his voice
On pepper tree
Heart's been swallowed whole
Who's real muse and she

Heart's been swallowed whole
Who's real muse and she

You gotta, gotta, gotta gain his voice
On purple scotch
Harden, harden, harden dont's and wont's
My easel touch
