// Go Easy //

Looking at me you never find out what a working man's about
Raving all night, sleeping away the day
Something to ask
Something to say
Something to keep the pain away
Something I'd like to see if it's alright

Life, go easy on me
Love, don't pass me by

Spending my time, making it shine, gotta throw away the rest
Look at the ways to vent and amaze my mind
Something I need
Something I plead for
Something I have to say
Something to keep me safe while I'm away

Life, go easy on me
Love, don't pass me by
Life, go easy on me
Love, don't pass me by

One way for me, one way for you, one way for all of us
To get back home, do whatever we want to do
Nothing to tell you
Nothing to show
Nothing that you don't know
Something to play
Something to say for now

Life, go easy on me
Love, don't pass me by
Life, go easy on me
Love, don't pass me by
Love, don't pass me by
Love, don't pass me by
Love, don't pass me by

// Bless The Weather //

Time after time, I held it
Just to watch it die
Line after line, I loved it
Just to watch it cry

Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you away
Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you home

Wave after wave, I watched it
Just to watch it turn
Day after day, I cooled it
Just to watch it burn

Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you home
Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you away

Pain after pain I stood in
Just to see how it would feel
Rain after rain I stood in
Just to make it real

Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the day you go away
Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you away

Time after time, I held it
Just to watch it die
Line after line, I held it
Just to watch it cry

Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you away
Bless the weather that brought you to me
Curse the storm that takes you away

// Sugar Lump //

Get down, mama, to my sugar cube
Get down mama, won't you try to make it move
My sugar cube, my sugar cube
Come on, mama, try to lose your mind
Get down, spent some time on my sugar cube

Gonna sweeten your night
And gonna sweeten your day
So much sweeter, you're just going to be amazed
At my sugar cube, my sugar cube
Get down, mama, won't you lose your mind
Won't you please get down
And try to lose your mind, on my sugar cube

I don't wish civil shit
I don't care to boast
You know that love is from coast to coast
My sugar cube, my little sugar cube
Come on, mama, won't you lose your mind
Get down and waste some time on my sugar cube

Get down, mama, on my sugar cube
Please get down, won't you try to make it move
My sugar cube, my sugar cube
Come on, mama, won't you lose your mind
Won't you please get down and try to spend some time
On my sugar cube

// Walk To The Water //

She walked to the water
And came back looking good and feeling fine
And you could tell by her eyes, she was not wasting time
She walked to the water
And every light went on inside the town
You know the love in her eyes, was flashing on the rocks all around

Down to the water
She walked and all the people moved aside
You know the light in her hair so bright, they almost cried
Saved by the water
She said and she was right, I know she was
You know she told me true about all the things I got

Going down to see her
Bring yourself and all that you might own
She can give you the clues to all the seeds you've sown
Down to the water
She came back feeling fine and looking good
And you could tell by her eyes that she always knew she would

// Just Now //

Searching back through the friends I've known
Sometimes sad for the way it's grown
Ranging up and ranging out
And trying to change my ways about
There's a place in the leaf, a place in the bow
I've found a place for me
Just now, just now
Just now

Moving on with every word
Moving with all the words I heard
Turning the wheel as fast as I can
Turning the wheel to make me a man
There's a man in the moon, a man in the sea
Growing strong, there's a man in me
Just now just now
Just now

No behind and no before
There's no need to worry any more
Happy then, happy now
There's always a way to get happy somehow
Friend on the road, friend in the home
A better friend now than I've ever known
Just now, just now
Just now

Searching back for the friends I've known
Sometimes sad for the way it's grown
Changing up and ranging out
And trying to change my ways about
There's a place in the leaf, a place in the bow
I've found a place for me
Just now, just now
Just now, just now

// Head And Heart //

There's just no way to say how much I love you
You never made me cry
And that's just fine
Only got my fear
To put above you
You know we all get scared from time to time

Love me with your head and heart
Love me from the place it starts
Love me from your head and heart
Love me like a child

There's just no way to play the things I'm feeling
No way to tell you all the things you mean
Everyday I only feel like stealing
Away to where I know I can be clean

Love me with your head and heart
Love me from the place it starts
Love me from your head and heart
Love me when I'm wild

Laying down the ways to say I need you
Scared of looking tall and feeling small
Running through the days I have beside you
Scared of being wrong and that's it all

Love me with your head and heart
Love with your very self
Love me with your head and heart
Love me like a child

There's just no way to say how much I love you
You never made me cry
And that's just fine
Only got my fear
To bare above you
You know we all get scared from time to time

Love me with your head and heart
Love me from the very start
Love me from your head and heart
Love me like a child

// Let The Good Things Come //

I wish I had walked down, every road I ever set my eyes upon
I wish I could take care, of every dream I ever set my heart upon
I wish I could step free, of every weight I ever leaned my weight upon
Lay low, let the good things come
Lay low, let the good things come

Wish I could walk out, of every scene of every game I ever played
I wish I could move on, from every place in every town I ever stayed
I wish I could let go, and hold on to anything I wanted to
Let go, let the good things come
Let go, let the good things come
Lay low, let the good things come
Let go, let the good things come

I wish I could see you, and bear the times and long the days to waste away
I wish I could be you, and see the world another way, another way
I wish you could get through, to every face and every friend I ever knew
Let go, let the good things come
Let go, let the good things come
Let go, let the good things come
Lay low, let the good things come

// Back Down The River //

I know that we're going to be together you and me
For more than a rhyme or two your time belongs to me
Rowing back down my river
Chasing my tail to the sea
Rowing back down my river
Trying my best to be me

Watching your crazy ways and all the lazy days
Digging you more and more the more I see your face
Rowing back down my river
Trying my best to be free
Rowing back down my river
Chasing my tail to the sea

Watching the simple things to help me grow along
Loving the notes you bring to help me sing my song
Rowing back down my river
Trying my best to be me
Rowing back down my river
Singing my songs to the sea

I know that we're going to be together, you and me
For more than a time or two your rhymes belong to me
Rowing back down my river
Chasing my tail to the sea
Rowing back down my river
Trying my best to be me

// Singin' In The Rain //

I'm singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling
I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above
The sun's in my heart
And I'm ready for love

Let the stormy clouds chase
Everyone from the place
Come on with the rain
I have a smile on my face
I walk down the lane
With a hap-hap-happy refrain
I'm singin', just singin' in the rain

// May You Never (Single Version) //

May you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold

You're just like a great strong brother to me
And you know I love you like I should
And you never talk dirty behind my back
And I know that there's times you could

Oh please won't you, please won't you
Bear it in mind
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
Now please won't you, please won't you
Bear it in mind for me

May you never lose your temper
If you get in a bar-room fight
May you never lose your woman overnight

You're just like a good close brother to me
And you know I love you like I should
And you hold no knife to stab me in the back
And I know there's those that would

Oh please won't you, please won't you
Bear it in mind
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
Now please won't you, please won't you
Bear it in mind for me

May you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold
May you never lose your temper
If you get in a bar-room fight
May you never lose your woman overnight
