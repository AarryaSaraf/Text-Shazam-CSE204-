// One Day Without You //

One day without you
And I feel just like I'm somebody else
One day without you
And there's a fear there might be somebody else

You know that I'd like to keep you
Keep you to myself, and by my side
You know I'd like to keep you
Just like I know it's wrong to try
Just like my babies were born to cry
Every bird that sings is born to fly

One day without you
And I feel just like some lost ship at sea
One day without you
And every friend I meet seems strange to me

You know that I'd like to keep you
Keep you to myself, by my side
You know that I like to keep you
Just like I know it's wrong to try
Just like my babies were born to cry
Every bird that sings is born to fly

One day without you
I feel a hole just where my heart should be
One day without you
And I feel just how sad my life could be

You know I'd like to keep you
Keep you to myself, keep you by my side
You know I like to keep you
Just like I know it's wrong to try
Just like my babies were born to cry
Every bird that sings deserves to fly...

// Lay It All Down //

Darling will you walk with me gentle
Come walking through the evening air
And I believe that you can make me feel better
And I believe that you might always be there
I want to move out of town
And follow the sound
And lay it all down

Darling do you know I've been lonely
Darling do you know I've been bad
Darling do you know I've been lied to
Darling do you know it made me sad
I want to move out of town
And follow myself
And lay it all down

// Root Love //

A thousand kisses flying home to you
A thousand kisses, two thousand miles from view
Root love

A hotel room don't make it
When I'm thinking about your face
Cheap experience don't shake it
Thinking about my place
Root love, root love

And that Harvey's banging walls again
And the paint job's wearing thin
Got to feeling mean again
Like momma drinking gin
Root love

The bar looks so inviting
Maybe one more Fanny Mae
Maybe one more happy hour
And another day away from
Root love

Little boy blue lost again
Telling others sorry tales
Just one more sinking sunrise
And two more crimson sails
And root love

Well a hotel just don't make it
When I'm thinking about your face
Cheap experience don't shake it
Thinking about my place
Root love
A thousand kisses, root love

// My Baby Girl //

My baby girl
She's the sweetest in the whole wide world
She wears her hair way up in a curl
Just to show she's my very own baby girl

She says: Daddy will you sing for me
Daddy try to swing for me
Daddy play your strings for me
She says: Daddy don't you cry for me
Daddy will you fly for me
Daddy will you try for me

My little Miss Wisp
She makes my heart feel tight like a fist
A number one girl in most every way
When she pulls my strings, you've got to give her her say

She says: Daddy will you sing for me
Daddy try to swing for me
Daddy play your strings for me
She says: Daddy don't you cry for me
Daddy will you fly for me
Daddy go and try for me

My tiny dream
She makes me feel like a cat with her cream
She shines and bubbles like the clearest of streams
She makes me know it's not as bad as it sometimes seems

She says: Daddy will you sing for me
Daddy try to swing for me
Daddy play your strings for me
She says: Daddy don't you cry for me
Daddy will you fly for me
Daddy go and try for me

My baby girl
She's just my baby girl

// Sunday's Child //

Saturday night come creeping
Saturday night come creeping cold
Saturday night come laughing and dancing
Sunday leaves you cold

Saturday night come crying
Saturday night come weeping and sore
Saturday night finds you looking for friends
That you don't want to see no more

Saturday night come crazy
Saturday night come swinging and wild
Saturday night come sharp as my suit
I want to be Sunday's child

Saturday night come creeping
Saturday night come creeping and cold
Saturday night come laughing and dancing
Sunday leaves you old
Leaves you old

// Spencer The Rover //

This tune was composed by Spencer the Rover
As valiant a man as ever left home
And he had been much reduced
Which caused great confusion
And that was the reason he started to roam

In Yorkshire near Rotherham, he had been on the ramble
Weary of travelling, he sat down to rest
By the foot of yon' mountain
Lays a clear flowing fountain
With bread and cold water he himself did refresh

With the night fast approaching, to the woods he resorted
With wood, vine and ivy his bed for to make
But he dreamt about sighing
Lamenting and crying
Go home to your family and rambling forsake

Twas the fifth day of November, I've reason to remember
When first he arrived home to his family and friends
And they did stand so astounded
Surprised and dumbfounded
To see such a stranger once more in their sight

And his children come around him with their prittle prattling stories
With their prittle prattling stories to drive care away
And he's as happy as those
As have thousands of riches
Contented he'll remain and not ramble away

This tune was composed by Spencer the Rover
As valiant a man as ever left home
And he had been much reduced
And caused great confusion
And that was the reason he started to roam

// Clutches //

Well my residential woman said, said to me
That you daren't eat peaches from a hawthorn tree
Well she said it to me once
And then she said it again
Even though I try, I can't remember when

Well my residential woman
She's as fine as can be
Yeah my residential woman
She's the one for me
And I believe, yes I do believe

And I believe to the depths of my dark black soul
Like I used to believe in sweet rock and roll
I believe to the depths of my pure white soul
Like I still believe in sweet jelly roll
She got me, she got me
In her clutches

Well my very special woman said yesterday
She's always economic when I'm going away
Well I turn around and say, she's got no reason to fear
Cos I'm always economic when you're sitting right here

My very special woman
She's the one for me
My residential woman
She's as sweet as can be
Well I believe, yes I believe

I believe to the depths of my hard luck soul
Like I used to believe in sweet jelly roll
Believe to the depths of my pure white soul
I used to believe in sweet rock and roll
She got me, yeah, she got me
In her clutches
Sweet clutches
Every kind of clutches
Those clutches

// The Message //

Every day and all night
I'm trying to tell you're all right
Every day and every night
I try to tell you it's black and white

And though I know it's your life and your time
And I know that it makes you feel fine
Don't you know that it's wrong
If you let life do that to you, love

Step we gaily on we go
Heel for heel and toe for toe
Arm and arm and row and row
All for Mhairi's wedding

Plenty herring, plenty meal
Plenty fish to fill the creel
Plenty bonnie bairns as well
That's the toast for Mhairi

Every day and all night
You're trying to tell me you're all right
Every day and all night
You're trying to tell me it's black and white

And though I know that it makes you feel fine
And I know it's your life and your time
Don't you know that it's wrong
If you let life do that to you, love

Step we gaily on we go
Heel for heel and toe for toe
Arm and arm and row and row
All for Mhairi's wedding

Plenty herring, plenty meal
Plenty fish to fill the creel
Plenty bonnie bairns as well
That's the toast for Mhairi

Step we gaily on we go
Heel for heel and toe for toe
Arm and arm and row and row
All for Mhairi's wedding

Plenty herring, plenty meal
Plenty fish to fill the creel
Plenty bonnie bairns as well
That's the toast for Mhairi

// Satisfied Mind //

How many times, have you heard somebody say
If I had his money, I'd do things my way
But little they know, it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten, with a satisfied mind

Cos money can't buy
Youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely
Or a heart that's grown cold

Well once I was living, in fortune and fame
And I spent all my money, sweet money, playing at games
Suddenly it happened, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far, with my satisfied mind

Cos money can't buy back
Youth, when you get older
Or a friend when you're lonely
Or a heart that's grown cold
Or a friend when you're lonely
Or a heart that's grown cold

// You Can Discover //

One day our laughter comes flowing with the rain
And on the very next day, our sorrow sees us crying again
But darling: you can discover the lover in me
I can discover the lover in thee
Together we can roll and tumble until the cow come home

Sometimes our story's just too beautiful to tell
Like the bells on a Sunday, blues on a Monday, go together well
But darling: you can discover the lover in me
I can discover the lover in thee
Together we can rock and roll until the cow come home

Sometimes, some kind of sadness shows upon your face
Sometimes, some kind of madness tries to take my place
But darling: you can discover the lover in me
And I can discover the lover in thee
Together we can rock and roll until the cow come home

One day our laughter comes flowing with the rain
And on the very next day our laughter sees us crying again
But darling: you can discover the lover in me
And I can discover the lover in thee
I can discover the lover in thee
You can discover the lover in me
Together we can rock and roll until the cow come home

// Call Me Crazy //

Call me crazy, call me sad
Call me lazy, call me bad
But you move me, move me
I'm moving on
Cos you move me, move me, moving on

What could be sweeter than love?
What could be sweeter than you and me

Love you gentle, love you strong
Ain't no way our loving can be wrong
Cos you move me, move me
You move me on
You got me moving, you got me moving, moving on

What could be sweeter than love?
What could be sweeter than you and me

Sing about loving, doing it too
You know I can't do it all until I do it with you
Cos you move, move me, move me
You move me on
Move me on

What could be sweeter than love?
What could be sweeter than you and me

Call me crazy, call me sad
Call me lazy, then call me bad
You move me, move me, move me
Move me on
You move me, move me, move me on

What could be sweeter than love?
What could be sweeter than you and me

// Ellie Rhee //

Ellie Rhee, so dear to me
Is gone forever more
And our home was down in Tennessee
Before this cruel war
Carry me back to Tennessee
That's where I long to be
Among the fields of yellow, yellow corn
With my darling Ellie Rhee

Well, why should I from day to day
Keep wishing to be free
From the master I run away
For to be with my Ellie Rhee
Carry me back to Tennessee
That's where I long to be
Among the fields of yellow, yellow corn
With my darling Ellie Rhee

Oh Ellie Rhee so dear to me
She's gone forever more
And our home was down, down in Tennessee
Before this cruel war
Carry me back to Tennessee
That's where I long to be
Among the fields of yellow, yellow corn
With my darling my Ellie Rhee

With my darling my Ellie Rhee
With my darling my Ellie Rhee
