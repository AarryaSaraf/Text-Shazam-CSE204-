// Some People Are Crazy //

Some people are crazy about him
Some people can't stand his face
Some people they smile when they know he's coming
Some people chase him out of the place

But this loving kind of business
Might make your poor heart glad
Yes this loving kind of business
Might be the best find you ever had
The best find you ever had

Some people are crazy
Some people are just plain good
Some people talk wouldness and couldness
Some people don't do as they should

But this loving kind of business
Might make your poor heart glad
Yes this loving kind of business
Might be the best thing that you ever had
The best find you ever had

Some people got a glass eye
Some people got a window to watch
Some people draw conclusions like curtains
Ah, don't they draw them tight
Don't they, draw them tight
Don't they, draw them tight
Don't they, draw them tight

Ah, some people are crazy about him
Some people they can't stand his face
Some people they laugh when they know he's coming
Some people chase him out of the place

Some people are crazy
Some people are just like me

Some people are crazy
Some people are just like me

// Grace And Danger //

You know I wished you all you wish yourself
It makes me feel so good to know you've found somebody else
You want a word from me
I'll give you two
I mutter desperately darling
As you say goodbye
As I start to cry

Grace and danger
Grace and danger, grace and danger
Grace and danger, grace and danger

Sort of pretty in an ugly sort of way
Jagging strokes and hustling folks every live long day
My heart goes out to you
I think of me
I mutter desperately darling
As they say goodbye
Let me wish you as you fly

Grace and danger
Grace and danger

I never knew the road that carried me along
Crazy sidewalk, concealed by pretty song
You want my life from me
I'll give you two
You'll be no strife for me
As we say goodbye
Let me wish you as you fly

Grace and danger
Sweet grace
No danger
Sweet grace
No danger
Grace and danger

// Lookin' On //

What kind of love is this
Concealed behind your kiss
What kind of love would try
Behind a silent cry
To come stealing in, with an innocent grin
To leave you staring
At the empty ceiling, feeling nothing
Lookin' on
I'm just lookin' on

My cynic friends maintain
A low profile with a high disdain
I think I'll try once more to make friends
With the wolves that live at my door
And come stealing in, with their innocent grin
And leave me staring
At the empty ceiling
Feeling absolutely nothing
Lookin' on
Leave you
Lookin' on, lookin' on
Leave you
Lookin' on

What kind of mood will change
Or ease this subtle flame
What warm and blissful rain
Might doubt your trust again
For that beautiful thing
That once made my poor heart sing
Beautiful thing
It's never going to leave me
Believe me now

Just lookin', just lookin'
Just lookin', just lookin', just lookin' on
Lookin' on, lookin' on, lookin' on
Lookin' on, lookin' on, lookin' on

What kind of mind will find
Such a strange and empty time
Draw the finest line
Between loving and being too cruel to be kind
To let love come stealing in
With an innocent grin
Leave you staring at the empty ceiling
Feeling nothing
Just lookin' on, lookin' on, lookin' on
Just lookin'; lookin', lookin'

What kind of love is this
Concealed behind your kiss
What kind of love would try
Behind the silent cry
To come stealing in, with an innocent grin
To leave you staring
At the empty ceiling, feeling nothing
Just look: just lookin' on
I'm just lookin'
Just lookin' on

Lookin' on

// Johnny Too Bad //

Walking down the road
With no blade in your hand
Johnny you're too bad, that's what they say
Walking down the road
With a blade in your waist
Oh Johnny you're too bad, Johnny you're too bad
With your blade come flicking
You're licking, and sticking
Too bad
With your running, and shooting, looting and tooting
You're too bad

Cos one of these days
You're going to make your woman cry
Ooh, Johnny too bad
One of these days
You're going to make your woman cry
Cos Johnny, you're so bad
Ooh, that's what they tell me about you
With you licking and sticking
Switchblade a picking
Too bad
With you're looting, you're shooting, looting, your tooting
You're too bad
That's what they say about you

Walking down the road
You're going to hear a voice say
Come, Johnny, where you're going to run to
Come that sweet day
You be walking down the road
You'might hear a voice say
Come, Johnny, where you're going to run to
Come that sweet day
You might run to the rock for rescue
You'll find no rock, you'll find no rock there
Run to the rock for rescue
There will be no rock, be no rock at all

Walking down the road
With a blade in your waist
Johnny you're too bad, Johnny you're too bad
Walking down the road
With a blade in your, with a blade your waist
You're too bad Johnny, too bad Johnny, too bad Johnny
With your blade a picking, switchblade licking
Too bad
With your licking and sticking, blade come picking
Too bad, that's what they say about you
With your blade come licking, licking, sticking
That's what they say about you
Licking, sticking, too bad

Johnny go walking
Ooh, Johnny go talking
Johnny go walking
Johnny go talking
Johnny go walking now
Johnny go talking
Johnny go walking out
Johnny go walking
Johnny go walking out

// Sweet Little Mystery //

Just that sweet little mystery that breaks my heart
Just that sweet little mystery makes me cry
O that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try

My friends all tell me that I look so sad
They don't need to ask me why
They know the reason that I feel so bad
Since the night you said goodbye
It's not the letters that you just don't write
It's not the arms of some new friend
It's not the crying in the dead of the night
That keeps me hanging on, waiting for the end

Just that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
Just that sweet little mystery makes me cry
Oh that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try

I watch the street, I watch the radio
I don't need to turn it on
Another friend comes by and tries to say hello
Another weekend's almost gone
It's not the letters that you just don't write
It's not the arms of some new friend
It's not the crying in the depth of the night
That keeps me hanging on, just waiting for the end

It's that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me cry
Oh that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try

The time is flying fast, and I don't care
To spend another night alone
I want to see you, but I don't know where
Till then I'm walking on my own
It's not the letters that you just don't write
It's not the arms of some new friend
It's not the crying in the depth of the night
That keeps me hanging on, just waiting for the end

It's that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me cry
Oh that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try

That sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me cry
Oh that sweet little mystery that's in your heart
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try

Sweet mystery, sweet mystery
Sweet mystery, sweet mystery, sweet mystery
Sweet mystery, sweet mystery, sweet mystery
Sweet mystery, sweet mystery, sweet mystery
