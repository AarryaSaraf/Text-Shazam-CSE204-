// The Stage //

So I arrived, naked and cold
A welcomed change from the abeyance of a ghost town catacomb
No need for counsel, I appreciate the time I'm not alone
(Why don't you get my lawyer on the phone?)

There were days these child eyes
Would overlook the ugliness and fantasize
I found my heart for the first time and I awakened in me
I left myself to navigate... and oh I felt control
(It seems these sheep have quite an appetite)

Who is the crowd that peers through the cage
As we perform here upon the stage?

As the boy became a man
In came a calm sophistication I can hardly understand
So lost in ego, didn't notice when the time had slipped away
(Yeah, everybody's got a sob story)

Jesus Christ was born to die
Leave it to man to levitate his own to idolize
We're simply sociopaths with no communication baby
I see your angle but we differ from our points of view
(So tell me, what's your cross to bear?)

Who is the crowd that peers through the cage
As we perform here upon the stage?
Tell me a lie in a beautiful way
I believe in answers, just not today

Hope my wheels don't abandon me now
Seeing that I'm out here alone
I'm running out of fight
And the wind speaks a comforting voice
Guiding me to her arms
Mother, I'm alright

It took the birth of sin to snake-rattle the mind
Before a blow to the head by the gavel of time
To wake up
Won't you wake up?
When did the walking apes decide that nuclear war
Was the only solution for them keeping the score?
Just wake up
Can't you wake up?

(You do know this is just a simulation, don't you?)

Who is the crowd that peers through the cage
As we perform here upon the stage?
Tell me a lie in a beautiful way
I believe in answers, just not today

// Paradigm //

You've been breaking down for far too long
Far too many moons since you've felt well and strong
You see, you could say goodbye but you don't have to die
Not ever

Engineer the wires to your brain
Architect a code so you won't feel the pain
With your family by your side and vigor in your eyes forever
Live forever

I'm way up, a god in size
Beyond the reach of mortals I shed my human side
Farther, O' Father
I stare at my reflection, have I lost that boy inside?
Final paradigm

What's it really mean to be a man?
Think about your answer but please understand
While it's natural to fear, I'll make it disappear forever
I forever

I'm way up, a god in size
Beyond the reach of mortals I shed my human side
Farther, O' Father
I stare at my reflection, have I lost that boy inside?
Final paradigm

Singular I am

I have to question if these thoughts are mine
To live forever but did something in me die?
I'm clawing my skin but I can't feel it inside
I know the agony of pain would hurt so much better

I'm way up so far up
Have I lost myself tonight?
Father, O' Father
Have you lost that boy you used to know?

// Sunny Disposition //

We've been through hell. Sewn up our eyes
Found fuel in meds. Viewed through the narrow
Encouraged fear when so inclined
Bought peace through wars that doomed our children to die

Ego is sure to fix the world
Served up to happy boys and girls
I'd make a decision if granted the privilege but I'm afraid my taste is unrefined
And no one likes cheap wine

When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize

You own the burg. We sleep in streets
You dine then waste. We forage to eat
Well who pays the tab when you cross the line?
Who writes the check? Who's herding the swine?

Just takes a fence to rule the roost
As long as the scale has been reduced
How can we see outside of the pen when survival has possession of our minds?
Calmly walk the line

When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
All good things come with time
When you know then you'll know
Such a marvelous find in an illusion

(Vlader Lauder sat in sorrow
For all his teeth had gone
He drank sweet rum
While fingering his gun
And eyeballed a feast
Not one bite he could eat
Somebody cut off his head!)

Dear radiation, my sweet friend
Let agents dance upon my nerves
Let sunlight glow under my skin
Let toxins seep into my soul

When the clouds kiss your eye
Shadows stain on the high-rise
Raise your thumb to the sky
Fossilize
All good things come with time
When you know then you'll know
Such a marvelous time I will find in an illusion

It's an illusion

// God Damn //

Hey! Can't you see we're tripping on the wire
Walking through the candy land of our desires
Press the magic button and behold the world you crave
Where's the fun in freedom when it renders you a slave?

Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, god damn
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us warm

Hey! It goes beyond big brother in the sky
Beyond the threat of martial law no Horus eye
No one came to cuff you they just handed you the chains
Blind follows the blind and now the one-eyed man is king

Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, god damn
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us warm
Tunnel vision, no man
Damnation, god damn
Can't see the forest for the trees
Can't heal the wound before we bleed

No form of payment, no pot of gold will satisfy the debt of what he's owed
Spilling from the houses in a trance the children lined up on the road
Cursing at the piper as he lured your kids away
And led them to the river for what was their final day
No need for convincing on his pipe he played a song to fool them all
Fooled them all

Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorn
And now the fire keeps us (keeps us)
Tunnel vision, no man
Damnation, god damn
Can't see the forest for the trees
Can't heal the wound before we bleed

// Creating God //

Standing in the shade of altruism, answering the call
Came a modern messiah to save us all
Something far beyond a work of fiction, positronic brain
A world that's void of all the anguish and suffering, pain

Better tame your convictions before you go and open the cage
We're creating God, master of our designs
We're creating God, unsure of what we'll find

Never held a high regard for Darwin, selection takes too long
A little kick in the pool shouldn't do us wrong
Devouring the very last invention man would ever need
But exponential growth is a frightening thing, indeed

Sweet bohemian jury rounded up and hung in the streets
We're creating God, master of our designs
We're creating God, unsure of what we'll find

Sometimes when I look up to the sky I have to wonder are we
"Summoning the demon" you and I?

Have you noticed that I'm needing it more now, more than it needs me
Got a couple of billion that seem to agree
Surfing in an artificial dimension, but we're not alone
Now the master has become just a steppingstone, oh

Like a blow to the ego the bitter pills are harder to take
We're creating God, master of our designs
We're creating God, unsure of what we'll find
We're creating God, in search of the divine
We're creating God. Committing suicide

// Angels //

Took me years to make my motives clear
And the days have not been kind
Once a steady gaze and charming smile
Has been buried in the lines I find
I walk in the noise, quiet employs
And darkness seems to know just where I am

Mother wash the devil from my hands
Pray the Lord I have the strength to stand
Mother, tell me was it all a lie?
Show me where the angels die

There are words that never found my lips
There are words I'd soon forget
Thought the trick was never to look back
But it seems I've lost my grip, I slip
The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
And somehow all the bullets bear my name

Mother wash the devil from my hands
Pray the Lord I have the strength to stand
Mother, tell me was it all a lie?
Show me where the angels die

Took the road but should have chased the stars
Now I've lost my own way home
Had a photo of the time we shared
But I burned it long ago, I know
I struck all the matches stuck in the ashes
Forgive me, won't you simply speak my name?

Mother wash the devil from my hands
Pray the Lord I have the strength to stand
Mother, tell me was it all a lie?
Show me where the angels die
Die

(The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
And somehow we all found the warmth of the gun now
The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
And somehow we all found the warmth of the gun now
(Took the road but should have chased the stars
Now I've lost my own way home
Had a photo of the time we shared
But I burned it long ago)

The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
And somehow we all found the warmth of the gun now
The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
And somehow we all found the warmth of the gun now
(Took the road but should have chased the stars
Now I've lost my own way home
Had a photo of the time we shared
But I burned it long ago)
The faster we run now, the closer the gun now
And somehow we all found the warmth of the gun now)

// Simulation //

It seems I should have walked away
Reverse the wager I've no means to pay
Toto has pulled back the green tonight, in sight
And blue pills coat with such disdain
I wore the shades for so long
That I've forgotten how to see
The curtain rises but who dares to pull the strings

I know this may be hard for you to believe and all
But you only exist because we allow it

I've questioned all the voices in my head
Are they mine or have I been misled?
Total understanding doesn't seem to mean a thing
When you can't see behind the silver screen, a figurine
Can't you hear me scream?

By the way of cosmic rays
A subtle breakdown jarred the code display
A simulation as I can tell, our cell
Playing out a hopeless scene
We stand to lose all our charm
And faith just seems to wane
A billion years can seem a stunningly short time

You've been beaten down time and time again
But still you find yourself at the center of it all

I've questioned all the voices in my head
Are they mine or have I been misled?
Total understanding doesn't seem to mean a thing
When you can't see behind the silver screen, a figurine
Can't you hear me scream?

You hear me, you had one thing to do, one thing
And you fucked it up, piece of shit
Nurse, patient six-six-six-one-five-eight needs to be sedated
We need 500cc of Blue Comfort
Oh hello there dearie, I've been expecting you

Posturing the way I feel
Is truth only what we believe is real?
Marvel the sketches that paint the night, starlight
And take a breath before it's all erased away

// Higher //

Freed of the world
Shed of the weight
Onward to see you, my friend
Light years above (Take me higher)
Time seems to wait (Take me higher)
Promise to see you again (Higher, high)

It haunts to remember
All the memories of that day
Pre-flight demonstration
Led to desperate voices fueled by flames
Now I'm out here waiting
Hoping you would send a sign
Came a million miles
And the earth grows small as I lovingly leave it behind

Freed of the world
Shed of the weight
Onward to see you, my friend

We seem to have found it
All the hope we've been denied
There's more than we've been told
Had to find it on the other side
Now I must be dreaming
Face against the frozen glass
But there's no return now
And the blazing worlds salute
As we go flying past

Freed of the world
Shed of the weight
Onward to see you, my friend
Light years above (Take me higher)
Time seems to wait (Take me higher)
Promise to see you again (Higher, high)

Freed of the world
Shed of the weight
Onward to see you, my friend
Light years above (Take me higher)
Time seems to wait (Take me higher)
Promise to see you again (Higher, high)

Meet you in the stars tonight
There you find me drifting in the ether within the lull
Meet you in the stars tonight
There you find me drifting in the ether within the lull

Meet you in the stars tonight
There you find me drifting in the ether within the lull
Meet you in the stars tonight
There you find me drifting in the ether within the lull

// Roman Sky //

As the embers rose through the Roman Sky
Tell me, were you calm when they took your life?

Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true

Shared with us the world well before your time
Though they took your voice, words forever shine, yeah

Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true

As they spoke your fate, a fearless man replied
"As you will sentence me, your fear is beyond mine, yeah"

Just before you go, tell us how the heavens flow
Weightless evermore, as you walk beyond that door
Shine forever true

// Fermi Paradox //

Lights paint the windows in the sky
The past is sown
In pursuit our spirit shown
But for now there's no one home

Heaven works on borrowed time
(Walk alone)
Empty pages burn forever mine
(Walk alone)
Masquerade us upon high
(Walk alone)
All we are is all we've left behind

My sweet Medusa, reflect the empty in our being
Snakes born of fire conjure the demons in our dreams

In void we illustrate our lives
Emerge in small
Heed the sign meant to evolve
To the end we send the call

Heaven works on borrowed time
(Walk alone)
Empty pages burn forever mine
(Walk alone)
Masquerade us upon high
(Walk alone)
All we are is all we've left behind

Where children shiver in the cold
The sun will shine
Just a touch to heal the blind
In ourselves we hope to find

Heaven works on borrowed time
(Walk alone)
Empty pages burn forever mine
(Walk alone)
Masquerade us upon high
(Walk alone)
All we are is all we've left behind

Alone

// Exist //

[M. Shadows:]
Our truth is painted across the sky
In our reflection, we learn to fly
No hand to hold us
No one to save us from tomorrow

Sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
Far beyond the dreams of everyone
No light to follow
A shot in the dark
Does anybody know?
Sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
Far beyond the dreams of everyone
High from the heavens
I can't see the pain
Does anybody care?

Think for a moment of all the lives
Stripped of their essence before their time
We stand to conquer
But is there nothing left tomorrow?

I'm sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
Far beyond the dreams of everyone
There's no light to follow
A shot in the dark
Does anybody know?
Sailing away, beyond the reach of anyone
Far beyond the dreams of everyone
High from the heavens
I can't see the pain
Does anybody care?

[Neil deGrasse Tyson:]
We have one collective hope: The Earth
And yet uncounted people remain hopeless
Famine and calamity abound
Sufferers hurl themselves into the arms of war
People kill and get killed in the name of someone else's concept of God
Dare we admit that our thoughts and behaviors spring from a belief that the world revolves around us?
Each fabricated conflict, self-murdering bomb, vanished airplane
Every fictionalized dictator, biased partisan and wayward son
Are part of the curtains of society's racial, ethnic, religious, national and cultural conflicts
And you find the human ego turning the knobs and pulling the levers
When I track the orbits of asteroids, comets, and planets
Each one a pirouetting dancer in a cosmic ballet, choreographed by the forces of gravity
I see beyond the plight of humans. I see a universe ever-expanding
With its galaxies embedded within the ever-stretching, four-dimensional fabric of space and time
However big our world is â in our hearts, our minds, in our out-sized atlases?
The universe is even bigger
There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on the world's beaches
More stars in the universe than seconds of time that have passed since Earth formed
More stars than words and sounds ever uttered by all humans who have ever lived
The day we cease the exploration of the cosmos is the day we threaten the continuance of our species
In that bleak world, arms-bearing, resource-hungry people and nations
Would be prone to act on their low contracted prejudices
And would have seen the last gasp of human enlightenment â
Until the rise of a visionary new culture that once again embraces the cosmic perspective
A perspective in which we are one, fitting neither above, nor below, but within

// Dose //

What's the matter dear
Seems the ghost
Is in your stall
For a thousand years
Taured lived within us all
I've come from
Somewhere beyond

Lost in a world
Voyage in time
Shot through the worm
Scaling the vine

Here in '54
Tastes of napalm fill the sky
Axis wins the war
Seems the crop of our divide
I've slipped through
Bodies aligned

Lost in the world
Voyage in time
Shot through the worm
Scaling the vine

All that's me
And all that's you
All that's false
And all that's true
On the sea you sailed away
Another time
You'd surely stay
It's only fabric so it seems
Our intimate reality
We're living simultaneously
While parallel in possibilities

Lost in the world
Voyage in time
Shot through the worm
Scaling the vine

Lost in the world
Voyage in time
Shot through the worm
Scaling the vine

// Retrovertigo //

Before you advertise
All the fame is implied
With no fortune unseen
Sell the rights
To your blight
Time-machine

While I'm dulled by excess (Dulled by excess)
And a cynic at best (Cynic at the best)
My art imitates crime
Paid for by
The allies
So invest

Now I'm finding truth is a ruin
Nauseous end that nobody is pursuing
Staring into glassy eyes
Mesmerized
There's a vintage thirst returning
But I'm sheltered by my channel-surfing
Every famine virtual
Retrovertigo

A tribute to false memories
With conviction
Cheap imitation
Is it fashion or disease?
Post-ironic
Remains a mouth to feed

Sell the rights
To your plight
And you'll eat

Now I'm finding truth is a ruin
Nauseous end that nobody is pursuing
Staring into glassy eyes
Mesmerized

See the vintage robot wearied
Then awakened by revision theories
Every famine virtual
Retrovertigo

// Malagueña Salerosa //

QuÃ© bonitos ojos tienes
Debajo de esas dos cejas
Debajo de esas dos cejas
QuÃ© bonitos ojos tienes
Ellos me quieren mirar
Pero si tu no los dejas
Pero si tu no los dejas
Ni siquiera parpadear

MalagueÃ±a salerosa
Besar tus labios quisiera
Besar tus labios quisiera
MalagueÃ±a salerosa
Y decirte niÃ±a hermosa

Que eres lin... da y hechicera
Que eres linda y hechicera
Como el candor de una rosa

Si por pobre me desprecias
Yo te concedo razÃ³n
Yo te concedo razÃ³n
Si por pobre me desprecias
Yo no te ofrezco riquezas
Te ofrezco mi corazÃ³n
Te ofrezco mi corazÃ³n
A cambio de mi pobreza

MalagueÃ±a salerosa
Besar tus labios quisiera
Besar tus labios quisiera
MalagueÃ±a salerosa
Y decirte niÃ±a hermosa

Que eres lin... da y hechicera
Que eres linda y hechicera
Como el candor de una rosa
Y decirte niÃ±a hermosa

// Runaway //

As I walk along
I wonder what went wrong
With our love, a love that was so strong
And as I still walk on
I think of the things we've done
Together, a-while our hearts were young

I'm a-walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain
Wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery
And I wonder
I wah-wah-wah-wah-wonder
Why
Why, why, why, why, why she ran away
And I wonder
A-where she will stay-ay
My little runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway

I'm a-walkin' in the rain
Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain
Wishin' you were here by me
To end this misery
And I wonder
I wah-wah-wah-wah-wonder
Why
Why, why, why, why, why she ran away
And I wonder
A-where she will stay-ay
My little runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway
Run, run, run, run, runaway

// As Tears Go By //

It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Smiling faces I can see
But not for me
I sit and watch
As tears go by

My riches can't buy everything
I want to hear the children sing
All I hear is the sound
Of rain falling on the ground
I sit and watch
As tears go by

It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Doin' things I used to do
They think are new
I sit and watch
As tears go by

// Wish You Were Here //

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

And did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found? The same old fears
Wish you were here

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found? The same old fears
Wish you were here

// God Only Knows //

I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

God only knows what I'd be without you

God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Well life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
