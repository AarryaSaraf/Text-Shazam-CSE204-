// Nobody //

Ride in the shadows wandering beyond the frame
Float like a feather through space and time outside a dream
Pirouette with divinity in a dance we've shared before
"Someone dissolution"
This is "I am all" as "I am none"
Here we fly so high, no, I, no coming down

Shedding weight as I'm coming undone
All that's left converging as one
I am the sun
I am the sun

I'm a God, I'm awake, I'm the one in everything
I'm alive, I'm the dead, I'm a man without a head

(I'm a God, I'm awake, I'm the one in everything)
I walk with death in final exhalation
And come apart through violent separation
A thousand floors ascend into the ether
A lunatic enchanted by the reaper
(I'm alive, I'm the dead, I'm a man without a head)
And down below I leave a stranger laying lifeless as the light begins to shatter the skies
I ascend and leave behind the "used to be"
And tear the fabric worn to cover my eyes and see
I see
I see

Nobody

Breathe in the silence, ebb and flow among the waves
Blur on the spectrum in light come dark in equal phase
All I ever was, has been and always will be

Here I end as I started again beyond death and borne on the wind
I am the sun
I am the sun

I'm a God, I'm awake, I'm the one in everything
I'm alive, I'm the dead, I'm a man without a head

A crack in the darkness
A tear in the sky
A narrow moment when we find ourselves
And all we occupy
Return to the boundless
Immerse in the free
Letting go as you lose your name
And all you've known to be

Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody

// We Love You //

There you are, you've come so far
Sunny days, the air tastes so sweet, flowers greet
Birds will sing you mean everything
You can be anything

More power
More pace
More money
More taste
More sex
More pills
More skin
More shills
Build tall
Build higher
Build far
Build wider
Build here
Build down
Build up
Build now

Well, look at the way you go
You're one in a million
And you know it shows
And we love you
Unto the mud

More wants
More needs
More hits
Morphine
More speed
More drive
More self
More time
Build out
Build fast
Build strong
Build vast
Build too
Build more
Build all
Build war

Look at the way you go
You're one in a million
And you know it shows
And we love you
Do unto the mud
Mud

Race to scale the body stack
Lay foot to face atop broken back
A failure here is a failure earned
So do unto the top
Do unto the end
Do unto the mud
Do

More power
More pace
More money
More taste
More sex
More pills
More skin
More shills
More wants
More needs
More hits
Morphine
More speed
More drive
More self
More time
Build tall
Build higher
Build far
Build wider
Build here
Build down
Build up
Build now
Build out
Build fast
Build strong
Build vast
Build, build
Build, build
Build, build
Build, build

Look at the way you go
You're one in a million
And you know it shows
And we love you
Look at the way that you choose
You know you'll never lose
And all that you are
It was all you deserved anyway
Sunny days

And we love you
And we love you
And we love you
