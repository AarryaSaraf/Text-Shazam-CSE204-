// Beast And The Harlot //

This shining city built of gold, a far cry from innocence
There's more than meets the eye 'round here, look to the waters of the deep
A city of evil
There sat a seven-headed beast, ten horns raised from his head
Symbolic woman sits on his throne, but hatred strips her and leaves her naked
The Beast and the Harlot

She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great

The city dressed in jewels and gold, fine linen, myrrh and pearls
Her plagues will come all at once as her mourners watch her burn
Destroyed in an hour
Merchants and captains of the world, sailors, navigators too
Will weep and mourn this loss with her sins piled to the sky
The Beast and the Harlot

She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great

The day has come for all us sinners
If you're not a servant, you'll be struck to the ground
Flee the burning, greedy city
Lookin' back on her to see there's nothing around

I don't believe in fairy tales and no one wants to go to hell
You've made the wrong decision and it's easy to see
Now if you wanna serve above or be a king below with us
You're welcome to the city where your future is set forever

She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great

She's a dwelling place for demons
She's a cage for every unclean spirit
Every filthy bird and makes us drink
The poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
Fallen now is Babylon the Great

// Burn It Down //

Jealousy's an ugly word, but you don't seem to care
Converse behind my back, but now I'm here
Need no one to comply with me through everyone that I defeat
Don't need you, fuck camaraderie, this rage will never go away

Hatred fuels my blood, I'll burn ya down (you can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fail, I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone, see it in my eyes
Now I can understand, it's sorrow that feeds your lies

You're on my back when the water gets too deep for you to breathe
A crutch for you that won't always be there
Hide in the dark another day, the fear in you is here to stay
So keep the fuck away from me and learn to trust the words I say

Hatred fuels my blood, I'll burn ya down (you can't help me)
One king to watch the horsemen fail, I'll fight 'til the end (I won't help you)
I can't trust anyone, witness and see it in my eyes
Now I can understand, put faith in you for the last time
It's sorrow that feeds your lies

Run from me before I tear you down (be afraid)
You chose the wrong side (it feels so right)
I won't help you, let you rot away (despise what you say)
Run towards the light exposing your soul (we won't be there by your side)
Salvation's dying (Somebody's crying)
We're all gone in the end
Sweet child, we'll miss you
So far away, far away

I can't trust anyone, witness and see it in my eyes
Now I can understand, put faith in you for the last time
It's sorrow that feeds your lies

Falling away, can't buy back time
Burned it down anyway

// Blinded In Chains //

And we're at it again
I turn around, another fucking war, man
I don't know where to begin
But I'll start with the radical leaders
Their steps we're following

Running, don't go back and fight, too many you'll lose
(And as clowns you follow suit behind the blood between the red and white and blue but it's too deep for you to see and everyone eventually will take the step 'cause it's in sight you take the left I will take the right I feel the hate you've built for me and I say pay attention baby)

As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease

But it wasn't a sin, a sorry life judging every action
And as they're feeding your mind with this shit you forget
How to speak how to ask all the questions

The business at hand tonight, make the people choose
(I see another side in you but there's not much more I can do from on the outside looking in your government is listening to push you on the story of immortal father mortal son give them your mind and all your wealth the cycle will rebirth itself)

If they had it their way I'd burn in Hell
And your future's a fucking disaster, can't you see?
Don't give them all the power
When your future's in desperate trouble baby

As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease

I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact
You gotta make it alright
Easier said than done with no place to hide
And having no place to

Running away from condition
I see you but you're running away from
Your scared seductive system

Most would claim I live a lie (I live a lie)
When pointing out it's easy to predict these things (Predict these things)
Every color has its side (I have a side)
They live together vote and most embrace these same dark times

Please help us, please save us
Of course they have control, we're all the same
Up on the cross
Crucified their problem, drove the nail and let him rot
Family and friends, it won't matter in the end
I'm sure they'll understand

Now look at the world and see how the humans bleed
As I sit up here and wonder about
How you sold your mind, body and soul
Looking at the fields so green
I know this sounds obscene
I see you're living for tomorrow but decisions you have made
Will leave you empty

As they thank the Lord the blind can't see
Like a plague fed to the brain, deadly disease

I'd run away tonight with my mind still intact
You gotta make it alright
Easier said than done with no place to hide
And having no place to

You have fallen asleep in denial
Look at the way we're dying one by one
How it ends I'll never know
Just live your life blind like me

// Bat Country //

He who makes a beast out of himself
Gets rid of the pain of being a man

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
I tried, to drive all through the night
The heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
No oasis, here to see
The sand is singing deathless words to me

Can't you help me as I'm starting to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention

As I, adjust to my new sights
The rarely tired lights, will take me to new heights
My hand is on the trigger, I'm ready to ignite
Tomorrow might not make it, but everything's all right
Mental fiction, follow me
Show me what it's like to be set free

Can't you help me as I'm starting to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses, and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me, and you know I don't want the attention

So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long, my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
These eyes won't see the same, after I flip today

Sometimes I don't know why, we'd rather live than die
We look up towards the sky, for answers to our lives
We may get some solutions, but most just pass us by
Don't want your absolution, 'cause I can't make it right

I'll make a beast out of myself
Gets rid of all the pain of being a man

Can't you help me as I'm starting to burn? (All alone)
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
My confidence is leaving me on my own (All alone)
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention

So sorry you're not here, I've
Been sane too long my vision's so unclear
Now take a trip with me, but
Don't be surprised when things aren't what they seem

I've known it from the start, all
These good ideas will tear your brain apart
Scared but you can follow me, I'm
Too weird to live but much too rare to die

// Trashed And Scattered //

Keep on writing you're just raping yourself
(Nothing here can take my mind away from them)
Don't you ask about me, ask about somebody else
(Once I've fallen there's many stories to tell)
I can feel it, won't embrace it, it's overwhelming how far you take it
(Stuck in a state of questioning)
And don't you tell me you know we are destined, you won't convince me, I won't listen
(Resentment building, you have put our lives on hold)

Trashed and scattered again, I'm feeling so low
You waste your breath while fucking with me, my blood is so cold
My destination always unknown, I'll find my way there
But you goddamn motherfuckers always wasting my time

I won't be the victim, but the first to cast a stone
Sedated nights to the bar room fights as metropolis takes its toll
And don't you try to stop me, it's a place you'll never know
Don't try to judge or take shots at me, I'll never let you seize control

Play your game and walk away, your integrity don't mean shit, huah
Crawl on me you fucking parasite, and I'm going to take you out

Label me, that's fine, I will be somebody else
(Nothing in front of me but holes ahead)
Lie about my life, have a story to tell
(Lights went down, was on the edge and I fell)
Oh you're so insightful, let me remind you to twist and break me, should make you worried
(Long way to go and you are right there)
Two-faced liar, don't try and know me, deceit brings fire, makes sure you can't breathe
(Pick at pieces of my body below)

I never bothered with all the rumors, too much garbage
(All the same)
I'll stand right here, come on you falsehood deceitful liar
(I know my destination â there's no shame)
Don't ever take my side, I know you're never right, I'll justify the means
(Nothing's what it seems)
I'll stand around and fight, but there's no point tonight, been chained to this machine

Trashed and scattered again, I'm feeling so low
You waste your breath while fucking with me, my blood is so cold
My destination's always unknown, I'll find my way there
But goddamn imposter, are you out of your mind?

I walk down these roads alone and now you are seen here
My feelings that I'm having towards you are perfectly clear
(I control this ride)
My devils appetite is tonight and now I'm alright
But you goddamn motherfuckers always wasting my time

Play your game and walk away, your integrity don't mean shit, huah
Crawl on me you fucking parasite, and I'm going to take you out

I won't be the victim, but the first to cast a stone
Sedated nights to the bar room fights as metropolis takes its toll
And don't you try to stop me, it's a place you'll never know
Don't try to judge or take shots at me, I'll never let you seize control

Don't try and get the best of me
(No one can help but your own self)
City makes my body ache
(Lonely, don't try and prey on me)
Feel your world keep dying, (Don't try and get the best of me)
(No one can help but your own self)
No more use in trying (City makes my body ache)
(Lonely, don't try and prey on me)
And my body's trashed and low, but to you I'll never show myself or what's inside
And I've seen it all before and I'll settle the score
I'll never join your side

// Seize The Day //

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over

I see my vision burn, I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
These streets we travel on will undergo our same lost past

I found you here, now please just stay for a while
I can move on with you around
I hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever?
I'd do anything for a smile, holding you 'til our time is done
We both know the day will come, but I don't want to leave you

I see my vision burn, I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry (a melody, a memory, or just one picture)

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over

Newborn life replacing all of us, changing this fable we live in
No longer needed here so where do we go?
Will you take a journey tonight, follow me past the walls of death?
But girl, what if there is no eternal life?

I see my vision burn, I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry (a melody, a memory, or just one picture)

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over

Trials in life, questions of us existing here, don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real

So, what if I never hold you, yeah, or kiss your lips again?
Whoa, so I never want to leave you and the memories of us to see
I beg don't leave me

Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over

Trials in life, questions of us existing here, don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real

Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day
Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day

[Continues in the background:] (Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day)

I'm stuck here alone
Falling away from you, no chance to get back home
I'm stuck here alone
Falling away from you, no chance to get back home

// Sidewinder //

I slide through the wasteland that's my world
My hunger takes your life, preyed on to keep me alive, yeah
Mercy's all that you need, mercy's empty in me

Can't you feel the poison rising out of the morning and clear through the night
You can feel my strength destroy you straight to the heart from the venomous bite

That's right I shed my skin tonight but my fangs are hard to hide
And you know that you're going to die, yeah
Mercy's all that you need, mercy's empty to me

Can't you feel the poison rising out of the morning and clear through the night
You can feel my strength destroy you straight to the heart from the venomous bite
I can't regret, can't escape decisions made for me, no control
Fire that burns but never dies, wrapped around I'll bury my fangs inside

Making my way through the night you're still in my sight
You're running away 'cause you know you can't hide
My instincts are cold blooded hate; to you I'm the bearer of fate
Wrong place and now the wrong time, now terror is all that you'll find

Can't you feel the poison rising straight to the heart of the venomous bite
Can't you feel the poison rising out of the morning and clear through the night
You can feel my strength destroy you straight to the heart from the venomous bite
I can't regret, can't escape decisions made for me, no control
Fire that burns but never dies, wrapped around I'll bury my fangs inside

Stay inside tonight - you're out there all alone
Vanish from my sights - venomous control
You won't make it right - my appetite has grown
Lost the final fight - no love will be shown

Stay inside tonight - you're out there all alone
Vanish from my sights - venomous control
You can't make it right - my appetite has grown
Lost the final fight - no love will be shown

// The Wicked End //

Man's becoming more corrupt now, godless, wicked, and cruel
The soulless man stood silenced, Mary's words rang so true
Chastisement worse than the flood, spread the word, it's all through
Don't kill the messenger 'cause
As if we haven't swam enough in this life of misery

Voice your prophecy, shed us some light
Feel sorrow for mankind's chance to survive
Swallowed lies and swam in our own tears
A stab in the dark but it wounded our will
We won't be here tomorrow, hold on to me for one last time

We've grown into the numbers six hundred sixty six
War breaks, a sign of the end, eternally expelled
Look to the sky for knowledge, the stars align tonight
Eclipse and heaven shall fall
Now I know I've seen it all in my life of misery

Voice your prophecy, shed us some light
Feel sorrow for mankind's chance to survive
Swallowed lies and swam in our own tears
A stab in the dark but it wounded our will
Dust the apple off, savor each bite
And deep inside you know Adam was right
Lust and power, indulgence, no fear
Left with his sins, how does this end?
We won't be here tomorrow, hold on to me for one last time

As the prophets shed the light on what's to come the crowds did gather
Your time is precious, they explained, no time to worry, Messiah's coming
Don't go to sleep tonight, darling, hold me in your arms
These will be our final days and I can't let go

Walls are falling, churches burning, women ravaged, children crying
Flesh is tearing, some still fighting
In this world of misery

Voice your prophecy, shed us some light
Feel sorrow for mankind's chance to survive
Swallowed lies and swam in our own tears
A stab in the dark but it wounded our will
Dust the apple off, savor each bite
And deep inside you know Adam was right
Lust and power, indulgence, no fear
Left with his sins, how does this end?
We won't be here tomorrow, hold on to me for one last time

// Strength Of The World //

My story starts the day they said, "She can't be found."
The news so dark, heart stopped, I stood silent without a sound
It's over, she's finished, mother lies with your father and sister too
Cold-blooded, they suffered, shot down by the outlaws after you
Sorrow swallows my screams

Strength of the world is on my shoulders
Strength of the world is on my side
Strength of the world â the one true beholder
Ice in my veins for those who've died

I've seen my family fade away, you've taken my whole life
There's nothing left to say

Avenge the dead killed all who crossed me in my path
Suicidal, I never planned on coming back
I want it, I need it, revenge is dripping from my teeth
Need nothing to feel power and bring the killers to their knees
Nothing to lose vengeance to gain (you know I'll never be the same)
So taste my breath I'm close behind you (so desperate on your final day)
Sorrow swallows my screams

Strength of the world is on my shoulders
Strength of the world is on my side
Strength of the world â the one true beholder
Ice in my veins for those who've died

I've seen my family fade away, you've taken my whole life
There's nothing left to say

Sitting in silence with heaven above me I prayed every night by their graves
While I search for closure I feel it no longer
I can't turn my cheek away
I stand before you; I'll sin when I have to
But now I leave your side to avenge my family's pride

I've seen my family fade away, you've taken my whole life
There's nothing left to say

Strength of the world is on my shoulders
Strength of the world is on my side
Strength of the world â the one true beholder
Ice in my veins for those who've died

So far forever now alone, a greater punishment on me has been imposed
A killer falling from the light, I'll miss my family, I'll never be alright

That's all she wrote

// Betrayed //

Passion in my eyes, as I lived it everyday
But how could you go throw it all away?
In my dreams it's me and you
It's there I saw it all come true
As time went by faith in you grew
So one thing left for me to do

I feel it burn inside
Burn in me like the rising sun
Lifted into the sky
Took away the only thing I loved
I know after tonight
All your power crumbles in my arms
So don't worry, I'll be fine
When my life ends, I'll leave this scar

And I felt down I need you there
Every note and every word seems so hard to take
Finally, we're destined

A smoking gun in hand
Now don't you realize what you've done?
Put a bullet in his back
Your hero since you were so young
How could you kill the man
Who brought salvation through your pain?
He must mean everything
To end it all this shameful way

Passion in my eyes, as I lived it everyday
But how could you go throw it all away?
In my dreams it's me and you
It's there I saw it all come true
As time went by faith in you grew
So one thing left for me to do

I started here so young
And helped you get along
Just did it for the love
And people healed through us
Don't live your life in vain
Don't take it out on me
You're cracked, so just remember
I'm not your enemy
I don't deserve to fall this way
By a man who felt betrayed

I felt so down now you're around to rescue me
Every note and every word I'm listening, yeah
Sometimes problems seem too deep to take (Too hard to take)
Sometimes I cry thinking my future looks so bleak

Finally, together we were destined
I know what's best for us in the end
Someone hear me, someone stop me
Someone listen, why aren't you listening?

Passion in my eyes, as I lived it everyday
But how could you go throw it all away?
In my dreams it's me and you
It's there I saw it all come true
As time went by faith in you grew
So one thing left for me to do

In my dreams it's me and you
It's there I saw it all come true
As time went by faith in you grew
So one thing's left, to finish you

// M.I.A. //

Staring at the carnage, praying that the sun would never rise
Living another day in disguise
These feelings can't be right, lend me your courage to stand up and fight, on tonight

Ooooo....
Stand up and fight

The fighting rages on and on, to challenge me you must be strong
I walk your land but don't belong, two million soldiers can't be wrong

It's no fun but I've been here before
I'm far from home and I'm fighting your war
(Not the way I pictured this, I wanted better things)
Some are scared others killing for fun, I shot a mother right in front of her son
(Take this from my consciousness, and please erase my dreams)

Fight for honor, fight for your life
Pray to God that our side is right
Even though we won, I still may lose
Until I make it home to you
I see our mothers filled with tears
Grew up so fast where did those years go?
Memories won't let you cry
Unless I don't return tonight

So many soldiers on the other side, I take their lives so they can't take mine
(Scared to make it out alive now murder's all I know)
Nobody tells me all the reasons we're here
I have my weapons so there's nothing to fear
(Another day, another life, but nothing real to show for)

Fight for honor, fight for your life
Pray to God that our side is right
Even though we won, I still may lose
Until I make it home to you
I see our mothers filled with tears
Grew up so fast where did those years go?
Memories won't let you cry
Unless I don't return tonight

Staring at the carnage, praying that the sun would never rise
Living another day in disguise
These feelings can't be right, lend me your courage to stand up and fight

Watching the death toll rise wondering how I'm alive
Stranger's blood on my hands, I have shot all I can
There are no silent nights, watching your brothers all die
To destroy all their plans with no thought of me
No thought of me, no thought of me

Ohhhhh.....

Walk the city lonely
Memories that haunt are passing by
A murderer walks your street tonight
Forgive me for my crimes, don't forget that I was so young
Fought so scared in the name of God and country
