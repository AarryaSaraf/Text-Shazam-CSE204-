// St. James //

This is the story of a man
Who conquered life drink in hand
Ship unmanned
Marked by genius, channelled good
By some a bit misunderstood
They'd been wrong many times before

Some times our saints are sinners
They blur the lines and lead the way
Their way
Raise hell and a glass in reverence
The fearless lives of our great saints â our saints

Never a stranger to late night snake
Bite fist fights and empty pints
Unrivaled heights
He led with songs, they sang along
Created bonds that held so strong
Some were right and some were wrong

Some times our saints are sinners
They blur the lines and lead the way
Their way
Raise hell and a glass in reverence
The fearless lives of our great saints â our saints

It's by the sea and at night's end that's when the sin and swill begin
That's when he had that certain light inside his head
For every whisper he would scream for every draught he shared a drink
For every sorrow there is a light from our St. James

On the sea by the cliffs he watches, he waits the night to see
The day â his way
Last call will find us all
But there's a light that leads the way, our way

Some times our saints are sinners
They blur the lines and lead the way
Their way
Raise hell and a glass in reverence
The fearless lives of our great saints â our saints

// Shepherd Of Fire //

Let's take a moment and break the ice
So my intentions are known
See I have pity in watching you suffer
I know the feeling of being damned alone
I've got a storybook of my own

Don't you see I am your pride
Agent of wealth
Bearer of needs?
(And you know it's right)
I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak
Know me by name
Shepherd of fire

Well I can promise you paradise
No need to serve on your knees
And when you're lost in the darkest of hours
Take a moment and tell me who you see
Won't tell you who not to be

Now you know I am your pride
Agent of wealth
Bearer of needs
(And you know it's right)
I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak
Know me by name
Shepherd of fire

Disciple of the cross and champion in suffering
Immerse yourself into the kingdom of redemption
Harden your mind through the chains of the divine
Make way the shepherd of fire

Through the ages of time
I've been known for my hate
But I'm a dealer of simple choices
For me it's never too late

I am your pride
Agent of wealth
Bearer of needs
(And you know it's right)
I am your war
Arming the strong
Aiding the weak

I am your wrath
I am your guilt
I am your lust
(And you know it's right)
I am your law
I am your star
I am your trust

Know me by name
Shepherd of fire

// Hail To The King //

Watch your tongue or have it cut from your head
Save your life by keeping whispers unsaid
Children roam the streets, now orphans of war
Bodies hanging in the streets to adore

Royal flames will carve a path in chaos
Bringing daylight to the night (night)
Death is riding into town with armor
They've come to take all your rights

Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
Hail to the king

Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
The King...

Blood is spilt while holding keys to the throne
Born again, but it's too late to atone
No mercy from the edge of the blade
Dare escape and learn the price to be paid

Let the water flow with shades of red now
Arrows black out all the light (light)
Death is riding into town with armor
They've come to grant you your rights

Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
Hail to the king

Hail!
Hail!
Hail!
The King...

[Solo]

There's a taste of fear (hail, hail, hail)
When the henchmen call (hail, hail, hail)
Iron fist to tame the land (hail, hail, hail)
Iron fist to claim it all

Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun

Hail to the king, hail to the one
Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun
Hail to the king!

Hail!
Hail!
Hail!

// Doing Time //

The lives of some men
If walls could talk to spill the lies
We'd see the world through devil's eyes

I maintain an addiction
Been known to take it too high
I got an itch with a loaded hair trigger
And a one-way ticket to fly

When there's no writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
I don't need no lessons
After all
Everybody's doin' their time

Caught your eye in the corner
Don't you look at me wrong
Fucked up and thrown into the gutter gotta fix what don't belong

I see the writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
And I don't need no lessons
After all
Everybody's doin' their time

That's just the price to play
So tell me what you like
Gotta hand on the kerosene match tonight, right

Had enough of opinions
I got enough on my mind
Sell your soul for approval and a dollar
Got a pretty little body to grind

I see your number on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
I don't need no lessons
Watch the fall
You lost my attention
After all
Everybody's doin' their time
Time

// This Means War //

Hide my face again, harbor in the shadows
Feel this weight of sin hammering away
Die - with the guilt of a thousand AWOL soldiers
Die - watch the scythe usher me astray

I can't go on this way
Not as I am today
The ugly side of me is strong

Take aim, a loaded gun.
Pull back on all who run.
A coward's truth inside the wrong.

This means war
This means war
This means war

Lash your tongue of bane
Carry me to nowhere
Mental holocaust
Battle never ends
Lie! Mask the pain
Of a child who's forsaken
Lie! To myself
Praise the new regime

I left me long ago
Reasons you'll never know
No one to miss me when I'm gone
With no more words to say
No argument to stay.
Another post I don't belong

This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war

No home to call my own
No finding someone new
No one to break the fall
No one to see me through
No name to carry on
No promise for today
No one to hear the call
No tattered flag to raise

Walk the razor's edge
Cut into the madness
Question all you trust
Buy into the fear
I see the man ripping at my soul now
I, I know the man
I know him all too well

There's nothing here for free
Lost who I want to be
My serpent blood can strike so cold
On any given day
I'll take it all away
Another thought I can't control

This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war
This means war

// Requiem //

[Latin:]
Prodigia comploratus
Silens, oro
Regnet exitium.
[English translation:
"Prodigies mourning.
Silently I pray,
'Let destruction reign.'"]

Days of warning
Night brings mourning
My prayers wordless
Heaven is burning down

I walk stricken
Pitch-black vision
Oh, one, save me
Caress my weary eyes

Darkest Lord
Your mercy shall I gain
Strike the match
Engulf the earth in flames, in flames, in flames, in flames

Nature quaking
Prophets aching
I kneel faithful
Damnation cracks the sky

My heart fiction
Superstition
Your grace deathless
Give life to my last breath

Darkest Lord
Your mercy shall I gain
Strike the match
Engulf the earth in flames, in flames, in flames, in flames

Grant them eternal rest, oh Lord
Embrace them into your army of undead
Strike with vengeance those who oppose your will
And lay waste to all those who shall be sent before you
Walk with them and shield them from the blinding light of servitude
And devastate your enemies as they die by your hand.
Amen

[Latin:]
Prodigia comploratus
Silens, oro
Regnet exitium.

Rise from ashes
Violent clashes
My soul, vacant
Cleanse me of all this sin

I stand guilty
I bleed filthy
Born of fire
Savor this final hour

Darkest Lord
Your mercy shall I gain
Strike the match
Engulf the earth in flames, in flames, in flames, in flames

// Crimson Day //

Dark years, brought endless rain,
Out in the cold I lost my way.
But storms won't last, they clear the air,
For something new.
The sun came out and brought you through.
A lifetime full of words to say,
A hope that time will slow the passing day.

I've been wrong times over,
And I've been shamed with no words to find.
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow,
Walk with me, crimson day.

Don't speak, no use for words
Lie in my arms, sleep secure.
I wonder what you're dreaming of, lands rare and far,
A timeless flight to reach the stars.
A lifetime full of words to say,
A hope that time will slow the passing day.

I've been wrong times over,
And I've been shamed, with no words to find.
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow,
Walk with me, crimson day.

I've come so far to meet you here,
To share this life with one I hold so dear.
And I won't speak but what is true,
The world outside created just for you,
It's for you, for you.

I've been wrong times over,
And I've been shamed with no words to find.
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow,
Walk with me crimson day.

// Heretic //

As they search for blood,
All eyes descend on one.
Honest man in chains,
But that don't matter anyway.

My judgement day.

My flesh will feed the demon,
No trial, no case for reason.
I've been chosen to pay with my life.

Mad men define what mad is,
Turning witches and saints to ashes.
Rising masses marching to find heretic blood.

Impose your will on me,
'Til fire sets me free.
The flames of hell burn bright.
My fate decided by their lies.

Final demise.

My flesh will feed the demon,
No trial, no case for reason.
I've been chosen to pay with my life.

Mad men define what mad is,
Turning witches and saints to ashes.
Rising masses marching to find hereticâheretic blood.

Please, don't leave me.
Please, don't leave me like this.
I've walked a fragile line and I've fallen down.
Please, don't leave me.

My flesh will feed the demon now,
No trial, no case for reason.
I've been chosen to pay with my life.

Mad men define what mad is,
Turning witches and saints to ashes.
Rising masses marching to find hereticâheretic blood.

// Coming Home //

I've been away,
Searching for a reason,
Another purpose to find.
I've sailed the seas,
Fought my many demons,
I've looked to gods in the skies.

I've stood in hell,
Where many had to suffer,
I stared the devil in the eyes.
Walked many roads to witness ancient idols,
And found the great gates of fire.

Had many storms question my conviction,
Gave armies reason to rise.
The hangman's searching for bones he can borrow,
While I escaped in the night,
Fight or flight.

[Chorus:]
Live again,
All roads end,
I'll be coming home.
Tend your light,
'Cause on this night,
I'll be coming home.

Escaped the hail of calculated mortars,
Then drank the blood of a king.
The desert rain has washed away direction,
Had angels looking after me,
So it seems.

[Chorus]

Live again,
All roads end,
I'll be coming home.
Tend your light,
'Cause on this night,
I'll be coming home.

[Guitar solo]

My story ends not far from where it started,
My weary limbs have grown old.
I've seen the world through the eyes of a nomad,
Home is where the heart is I've been told,
So I go.

[Chorus]

Live again,
All roads end,
I'll be coming home.
Tend your light,
Cause on this night,
I'll be coming home.

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
[Guitar fades out]

// Planets //

Godless - meteoric war,
Anger â our existence nevermore.
You awoke the giants who were dormant in the sky,
Comets raining death from a fiery eye.

[Chorus:]
Mother of all, your time is coming,
One with eternity.
When planets collide,
Planets collide.

Damage â galaxy destruct,
Endless - celestial orbit corrupt.
You will be forgotten like the others lost in time,
Dead civilization left behind.

[Chorus]

Take heed, the violent march is closing in,
You can't defeat them on your own.
Weapons are loaded for the final stand,
And they're all aimed at you from heaven!

Planets collide.
Planets collide.
Planets collide.
Planets collide.

You will be forgotten like the others lost in time,
Dead civilization left behind.

[Chorus]

// Acid Rain //

Our day has come
It's drawn in the sky
So don't shed a tear now
Be thankful for the time
Life wouldn't be so precious dear
If there never was an end

Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away

We stand on the edge now
We've come so far
And through all the dust it becomes clear
You will always be my heart
There's no death, no end of time
When I'm facing it with you

Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away
Not even stars last forever
Cleanse us, Acid Rain

Stand near to me, don't look, be brave
Over the blackened moon 
I'm carrying you away 
Through the planets we fly

Children still play in the garden
Dance as the sun slips away
Not even stars last forever
Cleanse us, Acid Rain

Send us home
Send us home
Send us home
Send us home
