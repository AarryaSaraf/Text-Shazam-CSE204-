// Demons //

I've been thinking lots about my life and
How quick I'd wash it down the drain
Past tense the future, nothing matters now
I act on my own and I'm to blame
Living's a wicked dream, where things turn out all wrong
We're all so weak, no matter how strong, yeah

I tried running away from me
Convince me that I've grown, but I can't
Change so unnaturally. Demons. They follow me
I quit running away from me
Convinced that I have grown, but found out
All my reasons for insanity, all a part of me

I don't like that you're calling me a liar
I don't like that you found out I'm a snake
Been sneaking around for far too long now
I don't like how fast my intentions fade
Karma has beat me down, the worst is yet to come
Many mistakes and still I'm so young, yeah

I tried running away from me
Convince me that I've grown, but I can't
Change so unnaturally. Demons. They follow me
I quit running away from me
Convinced that I have grown, but found out
All my reasons for insanity, all a part of me

I can't
Count how many times
Awakened in fear, nightly
Palms sweating
Dreams
Of promises I've made
To no one but myself
Have been
Crushed daily

Don't lend me your hand
I can't trust myself
So how can you trust me

We've all made selfish bad decisions
We've all tried dishing out the blame
Convinced ourselves of our own actions
My problem is I'll never change
Been dealt some good cards that
I'll fold before it's time
Can't promise you that it's my last time, yeah

I tried running away from me
Convince me that I've grown, but I can't
Change so unnaturally. Demons. They follow me
I quit running away from me
Convinced that I have grown, but found out
All my reasons for insanity, all a part of me

Friends won't help you now
Hope lost gone too far
(Oh oh oh oh)

Prayers won't help you now
Hope lost gone too far
(Oh oh oh oh)

I'm scarred, yeah
Demons. They follow me, 'cause my insanity
I'm scarred, yeah
Demons. They follow me, 'cause my insanity
I'm scarred, yeah
Demons. They follow me, 'cause my insanity
I'm scarred, yeah
Demons. They follow me, 'cause my insanity

Demons. They follow me, 'cause my insanity

Demons. They follow me, 'cause my insanity

// Girl I Know //

Let me tell ya 'bout a girl I know
That comes alive when you take off her clothes
There's no tellin' just where she's been
Ask around but no one seems to know, yeah

Late at night when you're looking for sin
Call her up and she'll lay down the law
You can't trust her 'cause she'll lie to your face
But that's not why you gave her a call

You're waste deep inside
The lust and burning desire

We've all been more than eager to sin
And it feels alright, 'til we pay the price
Now you choose either naughty or nice
'Cause she's here for you
It's all yours tonight
You won't believe the stories I've been told
About a girl I know

Another thing about this girl I know
She's more comfortable down on her knees
Went to school, got a job, and then she shot into hell
All 'cause she's born to please, yeah

Don't get her mixed up 'cause she knows what she likes
Can tell the difference between right and wrong
She knows you're watching every one of her moves
Just more reason to string you along, yeah

You're waste deep inside
The lust and burning desire

We've all been more than eager to sin
And it feels alright, 'til we pay the price
Now you choose either naughty or nice
'Cause she's here for you
It's all yours tonight
You won't believe the stories I've been told
About a girl I know

The first times hard enough
But you made it through
The second time I see the changes in you
She's got you somehow
You're needing her now, yeah

We've all been more than eager to sin
And it feels alright, 'til we pay the price
Now you choose either naughty or nice
'Cause she's here for you
It's all yours tonight
You won't believe the stories I've been told
About a girl I know

// Crossroads //

I've been traveling for so long
So lost 'til I stumbled upon
Two roads in front of me, I had to take my time
To the right I could see a church
I took a step in that direction first
But to the left there was a watering hole
Where they were whiskey drunk
And now that's where I wanna pray

The fight down here goes on and on

If I was perfect then this would be easy
Either road is plausible on both I could drown
I walk through the center with no rules to guide me
I realize it's difficult but now I can see

There's gotta be another way to go
A way that's much more feasible
A combination of both these lives
A central path without choosing a side
I make decisions one at a time
And no I never say I'm always right
I'm confident that when I stand on my own
You'll see the truest form of a man when I'm shining through

The fight down here goes on and on

If I was perfect then this would be easy
Either road is plausible on both I could drown
I walk through the center with no rules to guide me
I realize it's difficult but now I can see

Oh, I hear them now
All the religious rhyme

You're a sin, you're a sin, you're a sinner

The left isn't better
It's just more of the same
Condemning all these people for what they believe
I'll climb to the top of their mountain again

No harness up to save me this way
And the closer to the top I get
The more they take aim
But I'm not you

I may not be perfect but I've always been true
I may not be worthy in your eyes
Climb up from the bottom for the last time
The last one, the last one, the last time

If I was perfect then this would be easy
Either road is plausible on both I could drown
I walk through the center with no rules to guide me
I realize it's difficult but now I can see

// Flash Of The Blade //

As a young boy chasing dragons
With your wooden sword so mighty
You're St. George or you're David
And you always killed the beast

Times change very quickly
And you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins
And the bodies at your feet

You'll die as you lived
In the flash of the blade
(In a corner forgotten away)
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
(One man, and his honor)

The smell of resigned leather
The sticky iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parry
At the fencing master's call

He taught you all he knew
To fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance
On the screams of evil men

You'll die as you lived
In the flash of the blade
(In a corner forgotten away)
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
(One man, and his honor)

You'll die as you lived
In the flash of the blade
(In a corner forgotten away)
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
(One man, and his honor)

You'll die as you lived
In the flash of the blade
(In a corner forgotten away)
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
(One man, and his honor)

// Until The End //

Weekends on young and angry streets
We meet, drink until trouble found us there
Living life as without a care
We've had our fights, been black and blue
It's true, I've even gone to jail for you my friends
Bet your life that I'd do it again (I'd do it again)

(Until the end)

Don't change the way you think of me
We're from the same story
Life moves on, can't stay the same
For some of us, I'm worried, yeah

While some have gone their separate ways
There's some still caught up with the past instead
But move on, you're missing most of your life
They say it's hard to stay the same
When some fail, while other men seem to gain, but friends
I'll be with you here until the end

(Until the end)

Don't change the way you think of me
We're from the same story
Life moves on, can't stay the same
For some of us, I'm worried

We're all falling forward
With no signs of slow
Some moving faster
That's all that I wanted
I wanted

I know it's hard
It's passing by
Memories
Be out all night
So reminisce won't bring you back
Just look ahead and hold on tight

We're all falling forward
With no signs of slow
Some moving faster
That's all that I wanted
I wanted

Don't change the way you think of me
Oh yeah

Until the end
Until the end
Until the end
Until the end

// Tension //

I wake up every morning, bright and early
Roll out of bed but I'm never quite alone
Tension is pulling me in all directions
And all of these problems use me as their own
Sometimes the pressure will just drive you crazy
At any time I could explode
I need some peace of mind, it's got me tired
Don't wanna lose it, but I'm turning down that road

I need a moment 'cause I've spread myself too thin
We all need a moment in our life
Work's hard, the days too long
And that's just where it begins
Tension has had us all this time

I sit in traffic every single morning
Just as I arrive, I'm slaving to the grind
Making the money so I feed my family
But I can't raise them, 'cause I ain't got the time
I got no free days on my busy schedule
I turn the page and it's the same
Don't like my situation, you don't either
Don't wanna look back scared, I'm working life away

I need a moment 'cause I've spread myself too thin
We all need a moment in our life
Work's hard, the days too long
And that's just where it begins
Tension has had us all this time

But every now and then
I drive alone
An open road
Hot summer day
A gentle breeze that feels alright
All alone
And I can't feel no pain
Only strength
Enjoy the sights
I feel alive
Relaxing here just feels alright
Far from home

I need a moment 'cause I've spread myself too thin
We all need a moment in our life
Work's hard, the days too long
And that's just where it begins
Tension has had us all this time

// Walk //

Can't you see, I'm easily bothered by persistence
One step from lashing out at you
You want in, to get under my skin
And call yourself a friend
I've got more friends like you
What do I do?

Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been, belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself, by yourself
Stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time

Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?

Run your mouth, when I'm not around
It's easy to achieve
You cry to weak friends that sympathize
Can you hear, the violins, playing your song?
Those same friends tell me your every word

Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been, belong
You can't be something you're not
Be yourself, by yourself
Stay away from me
A lesson learned in life
Known from the dawn of time

Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?
No way punk

Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Respect, walk, what did you say?
Respect, walk, are you talking to me?
Are you talking to me?
Walk on home boy!

// The Fight //

The problem with society's been how do we teach
And if they'll believe
We'll fight this battle for years to come
'Til we all accept that we can stand on our own
Grandfather used his hands, he worked them to the bone
Provide his family with a happy home, alone

Don't take your aggression out on me
My own man is all I'm meant to be

This common place is so lazy, old, and tired
All your ideas are so fucking uninspired
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?

You don't wanna be, they never say
But don't call us the liars

We've walked these alleys a thousand times
And scattered around a thousand lies
They are trying to hold you down
Your life may be hard
But keep your feet on the ground
Why don't I have the finer things that others have?
The chance is there if you want it all that bad
So bad

Don't take your aggression out on me
My own man is all I'm meant to be

This common place is so lazy, old, and tired
All your ideas are so fucking uninspired
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?

Don't try and get me confused
'Cause I do understand
That sometimes people need help
That they may need a hand
When this problem's going on
A thing you have to get straight
Is that you don't own my hand
And I don't owe you a thing
So don't think about how sorry you feel
And now you're treated so bad

This common place is so lazy, old, and tired
All your ideas are so fucking uninspired
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?

And as a race we look back and we've come so far
While some men conquered, the others had it so hard
But in these day we just complain while there's no one for us to fight
I guess we're bored and that's how we keep us occupied

// Dancing Dead //

Dead men, they celebrate
As the final chapter fades away
Cause they can't hide
We can see, their flesh is rotten
The band plays a hopeful tune
The champagne is poured as they socialize
The look in their eye
Hide in the light

Everything is paid for tonight
While at the party of the
Dead dancing in their graves
The drinks here are free
So relax
Enjoy the sight of all the
Dead dancing in their graves
And while the world that they built
Told them to change
Told them to listen
They just kept it the same
And now that midnight has come
I'm in a room watching the
Dead dancing in their graves

Bones covered up by suits
As the visible scars, they multiply
Kiss it goodbye
Too stubborn and I'll destroy
Tick, tock, the time bomb has been recognized
Been pressurized
Nowhere to hide
Swallowing light

Everything is paid for tonight
While at the party of the
Dead dancing in their graves
The drinks here are free
So relax
Enjoy the sight of all the
Dead dancing in their graves
And while the world that they built
Told them to change
Told them to listen
They just kept it the same
And now that midnight has come
I'm in a room watching the
Dead dancing in their graves

Feel, feel a coming strength
And now it's too late
To change

What you want is law
You crowd me with all that you stole
Oh, how the mighty fall
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Everything is paid for tonight
While at the party of the
Dead dancing in their graves
The drinks here are free
So relax
Enjoy the sight of all the
Dead dancing in their graves
And while the world that they built
Told them to change
Told them to listen
They just kept it the same
And now that midnight has come
I'm in a room watching the
Dead dancing in their graves

Feel, feel a coming strength
And now it's too late
To change

Feel, feel a coming strength
And now it's too late
To change

Feel, feel a coming strength
And now it's too late
To change

Feel, feel a coming strength
And now it's too late
To change

// Almost Easy (CLA Mix) //

I feel insane
Every single time I'm asked to compromise
'Cause I'm afraid and stuck in my ways
And that's the way it stays
So how long did I expect love to outweigh ignorance? 
By the look on your face I may have forced the scale to tip

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not... not insane

(Mother)
Come back to me it's almost easy
(Said it all)
Come back again it's almost easy

Shame pulses through my heart from the things I've done to you
It's hard to face but the fact remains that this is nothing new
I left you bound and tied with suicidal memories
Selfish beneath the skin but deep inside I'm not insane

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not... not insane

(Mother)

Come back to me it's almost easy
(Said it all)
Come back again it's almost easy
(You'll learn your lesson)
Come back to me it's almost easy
(But first you'll fall)
Come back again it's almost easy

Now that I've lost you it kills me to say
(Hurts to say)
I've tried to hold on as you've slowly slipped away
I'm losing the fight, I've treated you so wrong now let me make it right
(Make it alright)

I'm not insane, I'm not insane
(Ha ha ha ha ha)
I'm not insane, I'm not... Not insane

(Mother)

// Afterlife (Alternate Version) //

Like walking into a dream, so unlike what you've seen
So unsure but it seems, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway

I see a distant light, but girl this can't be right
Such a surreal place to see so how did this come to be
Arrived too early

And when I think of all the places I just don't belong
I've come to grips with life and realize this is going too far

I don't belong here, we gotta move on dear, escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on, far away from here

A place of hope and no pain, perfect skies with no rain
Can leave this place but refrain, 'cause we've been waiting for you
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway

This peace on earth's not right (with my back against the wall)
No pain or sign of time (I'm much too young to fall)
So out of place don't wanna stay, I feel wrong and that's my sign
I've made up my mind

Give me your hand but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Please understand I have to leave and carry on my own life

I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on, far away from here
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light, and I'd hoped you might
Take me back inside, when the time is right

Loved ones back home all crying 'cause they're already missing me
I pray by the grace of God that there's somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be
(Who are you? I'm broken, I'm choking on this ecstasy.)
Oh Lord I'll try so hard but you gotta let go of me
(Unbreak me, unchain me, I need another chance to live.)

I don't belong here, I gotta move on dear escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on, far away from here
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light, and I'd hoped you might
Take me back inside when the time is right

// Set Me Free //

There's a calmness to the air outside
Watch the sun color the sight of a morning sky
But all I see are clouds of darkest gray
A full eclipse to veil the start of another day

Hear the laughter as the children smile
Hold a newborn close and dream for a little while
But all I hear is death knock at my door
And think of painful journeys our young must endure

Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight

Touch the water with your own two hands
Let the freedom bell bring calm to a troubled land
But all I feel are my two feet in chains
I know the system, but I can't figure out the game

Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight

Take it all away from me
Take it all away...

Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight
Set me free tonight

// 4:00 AM //

There comes a day when we all find out for ourselves
That once we have the words to say, there's no one left to tell
I know why you're running away.

There's a place where nothing seems to be assembled quite cohesively,
It's all your mind, all your mind
Something little shouldn't feel this way,
We got a million thoughts we can't convey,
It's all your life, all your life!

It's four in the morning, you got one more chance to die
Like beautiful stories the greatest chapters flew right by
There comes a day when we all find out for ourselves
That once we have the words to say, there's no one left to tell
I know why you're running away.

These things don't happen here; another fictional reality
It's all you'll find; all you'll find!
It's just as good as any other day, I'm gonna teach you about mortality
No it's not right, it's not right!

It's four in the morning, you got one more chance to die
Like beautiful stories the greatest chapters flew right by
There comes a day when we all find out for ourselves
That once we have the words to say, there's no one left to tell
I know why you're running away.

In many ways I guess I'll never let you go.
I'm close behind but I've got room here left to grow,
Until our second chance, just enjoy the dance, and find out who we are
(These dreams will never leave you)
Let's find out what we are,
(These dreams will never leave you)
Never leave you asking why.

It's four in the morning, you got one more chance to die
Like beautiful stories the greatest chapters flew right by
There comes a day when we all find out for ourselves
That once we have the words to say, there's no one left to tell
I know why you're running, I know why you're running away!

// Paranoid //

Finished with my woman, 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane, because I am frowning all the time
All day long, I think of things, but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh, and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal
And so, as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could, but it's too late
