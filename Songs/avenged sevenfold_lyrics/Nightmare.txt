// Lost It All //

Run away, I'm living with a hole inside
A piece of me that I have yet to find
Edge of reason, lines uneven, turn me off, feel the blood so cold
Like a product that was bought and sold, asking me for the impossible

I ain't waiting for a miracle; I ain't waiting for the world to change
Under my skin lives the reason, under my armor I lost it all

No more faith, no savior made of our designs
Fooled me before, I tell ya' not this time
Raped my body, lost my vision, lost my mind, I had to let it go
Another day living irrational, another day inside this dying soul

I ain't waiting for a miracle; I ain't waiting for the world to change
Under my skin lives the reason, under my armor I lost it all

There's something in your eyes
A part of me that I recognize
I wanna let you know
We'd be there if we could and it's alright
You taught me how to feel
It's no wonder I'd do anything
Tell me why'd you have to go
With the worst to come lost the best I know
Time - seems like we lost it all

Burn it all! Burn it to the fucking ground!
Believe the words that I don't want me around
Life revision, indecision, world collision, and heads will roll
With nothing left except the pain to show
Mental manic driven overflow

I ain't waiting for a miracle; I ain't waiting for the world to change
Under my skin lives the reason, under my armor I lost it all

// Nightmare //

Nightmare!
(Now your nightmare comes to life)

Dragged ya down below
Down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever
(Peace of mind is less than never)
Hate to twist your mind
But God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed
(Burn the world your last endeavor)

Flesh is burning
You can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have
Such an easy soul to steal (steal)
So stand in line while
They ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave
Until the end of time here
Nothing stops the madness
Turning, haunting, yearning
Pull the trigger

You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know
That you belong here, yeah
Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare

(While your nightmare comes to life)

Can't wake up in sweat
'Cause it ain't over yet
Still dancing with your demons
(Victim of your own creation)
Beyond the will to fight
Where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason
(Loathing self-assassination)

You've been lied to
Just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve
To tell you how to feel (feel)
So sedated as they
Medicate your brain
And while you slowly
Go insane they tell ya
"Given with the best intentions
Help you with your complications"

You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know
That you belong here, yeah
No one to call
Everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare

Fight (fight)
Not to fail (fail)
Not to fall (fall)
Or you'll end up like the others
Die (die)
Die again (die)
Drenched in sin (sin)
With no respect for another

Down (down)
Feel the fire (fire)
Feel the hate (hate)
Your pain is what we desire
Lost (lost)
Hit the wall (wall)
Watch you crawl (crawl)
Such a replaceable liar

And I know you hear their voices
Calling from above
And I know they may seem real
These signals of love
But our life's made up of choices
Some without appeal
They took for granted your soul
And it's ours now to steal

(As your nightmare comes to life)

You should have known
The price of evil
And it hurts to know
That you belong here, yeah
No one to call
Everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fuckin' nightmare

// Welcome To The Family //

Hey kid (hey kid), do I have your attention?
I know the way you've been living
Life so reckless
Tragedy endless
Welcome to the family

Hey, there's something missing
Only time will alter your vision
Never in question
Lethal injection
Welcome to the family

Not long ago you'd find the answers were so crystal clear
Within a day you find yourself living in constant fear
Can you look at yourself now?
Can you look at yourself?!
You can't win this fight

And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb and our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside
We all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight

Hey (hey kid), I have to question
What's with the violent aggression?
Details blurry
Lost 'em too early
Welcome to the family

Hey, why won't you listen?
Can't help the people you're missing
It's been done
A casualty rerun
Welcome to the family

I'll try and help you with the things that can't be justified
I need to warn you that there is no way to rationalize
So have you figured it out now?
So have you figured it out?!
You can't win this fight

And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb and our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside
We all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight

Gunning for you
And all mankind
I've lost my mind
Psychotic, rapid dementia
I won't be fine

I see, you're a king who's been dethroned (been dethroned)
Cast out in a world you've never known (never known)
Stand down, place your weapons by your side (by your side)
It's our war, in the end we'll surely lose but that's alright (you'll surely lose to me)

So have you figured it out now?
So have you figured it out?!

And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb and our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside
We all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight

Deep inside
Where nothing's fine
I lost my mind
You're not invited
So step aside
I lost my

Deep inside
Where nothing's fine
I lost my mind
You're not invited
So step aside
I lost my

// Danger Line //

My sixteen locked and loaded
All fear has been avoided
You say the words and my weapon is drawn
This one could be my last time
Some people call it "war crime"
I may be staring down a lethal sight
(To die)

Nothing shocks you like a bullet hole
Leaving my fear on the danger line
Suffering no man should ever know
Leaving my faith on the danger line

I do this for my family
My daughter loves her daddy
Too many talk down on things they don't know
With colors never faded
Reckless and unabated
They may take me but never take us all
(I'll crawl)

Nothing shocks you like a bullet hole
Leaving my fear on the danger line
Suffering no man should ever know
Leaving my faith on the danger line
I know what you're thinking
I've been there before

So think of the times
The time we spent laughing away
So think of the times
At home
(Life without a care)

Now I find myself in my own blood
(Never thought I'd lie in my own blood)
The damage done is far beyond repair
I never put my faith in up above
(Never had much faith in up above)
But now, I'm hoping someone's there

I never meant to leave this world alone
I never meant to hurt the ones who care
And all this time I thought we'd just grow old
You know, no one said it's fair

Tell my baby girl that it's alright
I've sung my last song today
Remind the Lord to leave His light on
For me
I'm free

// Buried Alive //

Take the time just to listen
When the voices screaming are much too loud
Take a look in the distance
Try and see it all
Chances are that ya might find
That we share a common discomfort now
I feel I'm walking a fine line
Tell me only if it's real

Still I'm on my way
On and on it goes
Vacant hope to take

Hey â I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold on to faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And it seems I've been buried alive

I walk the fields through the fire
Taking steps until I found solid ground
Followed dreams reaching higher
Couldn't survive the fall
Much has changed since the last time
And I feel a little less certain now
You know I jumped at the first sign
Tell me only if it's real
Memories seem to fade
On and on it goes
Wash my view away

Hey â I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed
Grim as ever
Hold on to faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
Real as ever
And I'm chained like a slave, trapped in the dark
Slam all the locks, death calls my name
And it seems I've been buried alive

Take you down now, burn it all out
Throw you all around, get your fucking
Hands off me
What's it feel like? Took the wrong route
Watch it fall apart now you're knocking at the wrong gate
For you to pay the toll, a price for you alone
The only deal you'll find, I'll gladly take your soul

While it seems sick, sober up quick
Psycho lunatic crushing you with
Hands of fate
Shame to find out, when it's too late
But you're all the same
Trapped inside inferno awaits
Evil thoughts can hide, I'll help release the mind
I'll peel away the skin, release the dark within

This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die, buried alive
This is now your life (what's it feel like)
Strike you from the light (let me take in your soul)
This is now your life (what's it feel like)
Die, buried alive (let me take in your soul)
This is now your life
Die, buried alive

// Natural Born Killer //

One snap for the dying
One click to end the day
Another story with a mangled scene
It couldn't happen any other way

You wanna talk about it?
I'm begging you to walk in my shoes any time
Watch the clock 'til you unwind
You wanna cry about it
It's making me consider that I've lost my mind
The way I see you must be blind

So this is the world you left behind
This is the guilt that consumes you

So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you

Can't bribe me with money
Can't shower me with shame
Another killer from a broken home
Until you cover me with manic fame

You wanna know about it?
But I'm a be fucking with you every time
Story broken, you're behind
And when you ask about it?
You can rest assured I'll give you my best side
Seems we all have friends to find

So this is the hate I've been born to
Full are the tales of the untrue

So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you

And I'm waiting
Waiting for the days to slowly pass me by
(And all the promises I'll find)
No hesitating, you pull the trigger now your story's left behind
I know you wanna see me fry
Like my soul, you won't survive

So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you

To die unknown
Would crush the fish-lens we all see through
To kill the glare
Expose the ugliness we hold true

// So Far Away //

Never feared for anything
Never shamed but never free
A life that healed the broken heart with all that it could

Lived a life so endlessly
Saw beyond what others see
I tried to heal your broken heart with all that I could

Will you stay?
Will you stay away forever?

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away

Plans of what our futures hold
Foolish lies of growing old
It seems we're so invincible
The truth is so cold

A final song, a last request
A perfect chapter laid to rest
Now and then I try to find
A place in my mind
Where you can stay
You can stay awake forever

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
I have so much to say but you're so far away

Sleep tight, I'm not afraid (not afraid)
The ones that we love are here with me
Lay away a place for me (place for me)
'Cause as soon as I'm done I'll be on my way
To live eternally

How do I live without the ones I love?
Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
Place and time always on my mind
And the light you left remains
But it's so hard to stay
When I have so much to say and you're so far away

I love you, you were ready
The pain is strong and urges rise
But I'll see you, when He lets me
Your pain is gone, your hands untied

So far away (so far)
And I need you to know
So far away (so far)
And I need you to, need you to know

// God Hates Us //

Total nightmare!
Total nightmare!

You wanna hear my side?
You need to drown to know
With all the times it hurt me to fuck you
I built a wall with your blood to show!

God save us!
God save us all!
God hates us!
God hates us all!

Total nightmare!
Total nightmare!

Nothing to heal
No one to break
Pills had a role now there's nothing to take
Nothing to trust
No one to fake
You'll find out sooner that it's best if we just know our place
(Lies!)

My infiltrated mind
My lacerated soul
It took me years, create me, control you
I left myself for an idea I stole

God save us!
God save us all!
God hates us!
God hates us all!

Total nightmare!
Total nightmare!

Liar!
Rape!
Kill!

Love!
Hate!
Fear!

You better take your time
(Liar!
Rape!
Kill!)
You better take it slow
Cause when you seek the one
(Love
Hate!
Fear!)
There's nothing left to show

Total nightmare!
Total nightmare!
Total nightmare!
Total nightmare!

// Victim //

House full of roses
A letter on the stairs
A tape full of messages
For anyone who cares
Collage of broken words
And stories full of tears
Remembering your life
'Cause we wish that you were here

Nothing is harder
Than to wake up all alone
Realize it's not okay
It's the end of all you've known
Time keeps passing by
But it seems I'm frozen still
Scars are left behind
But some too deep to feel

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime

Some days you'll find me
In the place I like to go
Ask questions to myself
'Bout the things I'll never know
What's left to find
'Cause I need a little more
I need a little time
Can we even up the score?

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime

Nothing lasts forever
For all good things it's true
I'd rather trade it all
While somehow saving you
It must have been the season
That threw us out of line
Once I stood so tall
Now I'm searching for a sign

So don't need your salvation
With promises unkind
And all those speculation
Save it for another time
'Cause we all need a reason
A reason just to stay
Some just can't be bothered
To stick around another day

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We've all been victims of a crime
When all is gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside (oh)
We've all been victims of a crime
Victims of a crime
Living with this crime

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you

// Tonight The World Dies //

Lost the meaning of our stay
Learn to live another day
Doubt the choices that we've made
I know that we can't hide our shame
It's only in disguise

Drowning in our own debris
Fool our thoughts as though we're free
Close our eyes so we can see
The depth of all we mean to be
If only in my eyes

I don't mind
(Read the writing on the wall)
Mother cries
(Tortured voices as we crawl)
Find me on my better days
To lose it once again
In a way

So try and love me while you can
And take the time to understand
As long as I can touch your face
You know I'll never leave this place
If only in my mind

I don't mind
(Read the writing on the wall)
Mother cries
(Tortured voices as we crawl)
Find me on my better days
To lose it once again
But I seem to find no better ways
To consciously pretend

Silence all I want to say
With tendencies to run away
I'll run away
With you tonight
Launder all my sins away
And just like that mistakes are made
You know
Tonight the world dies

I don't mind
(Read the writing on the wall)
Mother cries
(Tortured voices as we crawl)
Find me on my better days
To lose it once again
But I seem to find no better ways
To consciously pretend

// Fiction //

[M. Shadows and The Rev:]
Now I think I understand
How this world can overcome a man
Like a friend we saw it through
In the end I gave my life for you

[M. Shadows:]
Gave you all I had to give
Found a place for me to rest my head
While I may be hard to find
Heard there's peace just on the other side

[The Rev:]
Not that I could
Or that I would
Let it burn
Under my skin
Let it burn

[M. Shadows:]
Left this life to set me free
Took a piece of you inside of me
All this hurt can finally fade
Promise me you'll never feel afraid

[The Rev:]
Not that I could
Or that I would
Let it burn
Under my skin
Let it burn

I hope it's worth it
Here on the highway, yeah
I know you'll find your own way
When I'm not with you
So tell everybody
The ones who walk beside me, yeah
I hope you'll find your own way
When I'm not with you tonight

[M. Shadows and The Rev:]
I hope it's worth it
What's left behind me, yeah
I know you'll find your own way
When I'm not with you
So tell everybody
The ones who walk beside me, yeah
I know you'll find your own way
When I'm not with you tonight

// Save Me //

Skull!

They all know
They all know

Sorry did I wake your dreams?
Some questions run too deep
We only only wake up when we sleep
Led by the lunar light, trouble's all we'd find
Lost our way tonight

Is it something we said?
Is it something we said to them?
Is it something we said?

Save me
I'm trapped in a vile world
Where the end game's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
Save me
I'm losing my only dream
I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If you hear me let me know

They all know
They all know

Ever since the day you left my fate's been set unknown
How many years to walk this path alone?
So much to see tonight, so why'd you close your eyes?
Why can't I shut mine?

Is it something we did?
Is it something we did to them?
Is it something we did?

Save me
I'm trapped in a vile world
Where the end game's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
Save me
I'm losing my only dream
I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If you hear me let me know, if you hear me let me know

Aaaah

Help me find my way
I said help me find my way
No pulse inside of me
Stone cold lips and heresy
All lies and to a degree
Losing who I wanna be

You'll find out right now

He may be out of his mind, but some day you will find
That sanity's left us all blind, and dragged us all behind
A moment seen through those eyes, crystal blue disguise
They say that all beauty must die, I say it just moves on

If you'd only open your mind, then someday you will find
Insanity left us behind, and walked right through the door
I can see the pictures clear as yesterday, pictures all my own
I can hear the voices begging you to stay, but know you're not alone

Save me
I'm trapped in a vile world
Where the end game's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
Save me
I'm losing my only dream
I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If you hear me let me know, if you hear me let me know

Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die
Tonight we all die young
