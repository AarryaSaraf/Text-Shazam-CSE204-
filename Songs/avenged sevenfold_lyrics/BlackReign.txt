// Mad Hatter //

From the manor a cutting whisper
Rising vapors through clocks of gold
Gilding fire unchains the demons
With undercurrents far too strong to hold

The sun burned out today
And fools are dancing in the rain
Scarred by the acid stain
And on the shelf a jar that holds my brain

Nightfall haunts us all from the shadows
Cynical beauty now lights the halls
Before the flicker there was only blackness
The end is coming and all my friends are dead

The sun burned out today
And fools are dancing in the rain
Scarred by the acid stain
And on the shelf a jar that holds my brain

Gripped by an empty world
Suffer the crushing weight
Madness will crawl inside
Alter the sober state
They're feeding all the voices in my head

(Slowly we're bled)
(Slowly we're bled)
(Slowly we're bled)
(Slowly we're bled)
(Slowly we're bled)

The Labyrinth hedges return to soil
Mother's weeping will go unheard
The dove that once flew here through the mazes
Had seen the darkness and chose to take its life

The sun burned out today
And fools are dancing in the rain
Scarred by the acid stain
And on the shelf a jar that holds my brain

Gripped by an empty world
Suffer the crushing weight
Madness will crawl inside
Alter the sober state
They're feeding all the voices in my head
They're feeding all the voices in my head
They're feeding all the voices in my head
They're feeding all the voices in my head

// Carry On //

Some people live out selfish desires
Some choose to shout when they speak deafening us all
Caught in the flame of those deep in fire
Seeking out those with a voice, one for tomorrow

(They say we've lost our minds
We've just gained control)

Search endlessly, fight 'til we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, no more decree
Somehow we still carry on

(Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear)

Silence your fear, we've got to move higher
High like the stars in the sky, guiding us all
Battle the will of those who conspire
Take back the passion to live, vanish the sorrow

(Destroy their perfect crime
Watch the power fold)

Search endlessly, fight 'til we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, no more decree
Somehow we still carry on

Search endlessly, fight 'til we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, no more decree
Somehow we still carry on

Carry on

// Not Ready To Die //

Gone, cast away in time
Evil yours, now evil mine
So, I robbed you blind
The voices in my head suggest a less-than-peaceful side
Of endless possibilities controlling nine-three-five

(You can't break me) Crush the fears of yesterday
(You can't save me) Barriers â our trust will fade
I've stood in the dark, been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm trying to survive
I'm not ready to die

Damned, watch the masses fall
Burn it down, control 'em all
(Let 'em bleed) Make me crawl
To daddy's little girl to read the writings on the wall
While cast into the nothingness, the final curtain call

(You can't break me) Crush the fears of yesterday
(You can't save me) Barriers â our trust will fade
I've stood in the dark, been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm trying to survive
I'm not ready to die

Through the madness we find
Loyalty is no match for power
Say goodbye to your life
Left to rot in your darkest hour
Prayers won't help you now
As long as you're mine

(You can't break me) Crush the fears of yesterday
(You can't save me) Barriers â our trust will fade
I've stood in the dark, been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm trying to survive
I'll control the world
One person at a time
As I damn the dead I'm trying to survive
I'm not ready to die
Oh

I'm not ready to die
I'm not ready to die
I'm not ready to die
I'm not ready to die
Ready to die
Ready to die
Ready to die
Not ready to die
