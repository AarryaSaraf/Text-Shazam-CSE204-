// Tears Can Be So Soft //

I miss my mother
Miss my mother
Miss my mother at night
Ooh, she gave me life

I miss my brother
Miss my brother
Miss my brother all day
Ooh, we used to pray

I miss my lover
Miss my lover
Miss my lover at night
Ooh, to hold me tight

I'm on the freeway
On the freeway
On the freeway I cry
Because I can

Tears can be
So good for those who dive in them
Let them run on my cheeks
One more time

Tears are so soft
When you dive in them
Oh, let them sail

I miss my friends
I miss my friends
I miss my friends and the tenderness
Ooh, they give me cold hard looks now

I miss my joy
I miss my joy
I miss my joy and my head
Look at my face
What is happening now?

Tears can be
So good for those who dive in them
Oh, let them roll girl, yeah

Love is like this
Embrace when you can
'Cause at night
When you're all alone you think about it one more time

Oh let's embrace them when we can
Oh, sing my heart out
Tears can be so good let me pray
Oh, let me pray for my salvation, baby, now water
More water
I don't want more money, more water
More

Oh, water
More water
I don't want your money
Water
Is what I'm looking for

Tears can be so good for you, baby
Dive in it
And forget it all
Tears can be so good, let them
Roll on your face, girl
Oh, diamonds
On your face forever

// True Love //

Do you know how it feels to be inside it
But never talk about it
Do you know how it feels

Do you know how it feels
I'm talking to you
I'm always talking to you
So you know how it feels

So I can't believe you saw me crying
When I cry, baby, I cry for you (Yeah)
No, I can't believe you saw me dancing
When I dance, baby, I dance for you (Yeah)

Do you know how to love
I'll show you
Oh, I'll show you
So we know how to love (Oh)
'Cause I need you to love me
I need you to love me

I can't believe you saw me crying
'Cause when I cry, baby, I cry for you (Yeah)
No, I can't believe you saw me dancing
When I dance, baby, I dance for you (Yeah)

Angel of light
Take me higher
Make me forget my mother
With your dark brown eyes staring at me
With your dark eyes staring at me
Angel of light
Take me higher
Make me forget my mother
With your dark brown eyes staring at me
With your dark eyes staring at me

They're making the blame
It still feels the same (Right)
I'm doing the most
Hundred of those years crying
You said you wanted us soft besides you
Any word on me
Many one pass through me
It's so emotional
(I think about it all the time)
They're begging on me
I pass on their lives
I wait on the floor
Nothing making sense
I'm one on their knees
They begging me please (Let me tell you something)
Holy seconds to most
Trying to sit in your league
On a ride

Angel of light
Take me higher
Make me forget my mother
With your dark brown eyes staring at me
With your dark eyes staring at me
Angel of light
Take me higher
Make me forget my mother
With your dark brown eyes staring at me
With your dark eyes staring at me
Angel of light
Take me higher
Make me forget my mother
With your dark brown eyes staring at me
With your dark eyes staring at me

// To Be Honest //

I get lost in my thoughts, and for hours of time
And it's making me feel
Like I am not alone anymore
To be honest (to be honest)

I am trying to love, but I'm afraid to kill
And I never know when
When to search or stay still
So I fly
To be honest
With you

Broken and yet tender
Always in and always out
Heading to the water
Drowning in what it can hide

Kind of always cautious
Don't you don't you break my heart
Feeling kind of loveless
Yet always ready to try

And I've been through so much
That sometimes it feels far
It is like a movie
Played by another star
She's a stranger
To be honest (to be honest)

Now I'm sitting alone
And I'm trying to listen
To the stories that could
Make mine a little softer, and fine
To be honest

Broken and yet tender
(Douce et abîmé)
Always in and always out
(Toujours à côté)
Heading to the water
(Dans l'eau s'enfoncer)
Drowning in what it can hide
(Ne rien y trouver)

Kind of always cautious
(Toujours protégé)
Don't you don't you break my heart
(Y a rien à casser)
Feeling kind of loveless
(J'ai rien à donner)
Yet always ready to try
(J'ai tout à donner, donner)

(Away, away)
(Away, away)
(Away, away)
(Away, away)
(Away, away)
(Away, away)
(Oh, oh, oh)
