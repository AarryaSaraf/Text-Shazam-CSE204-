Un garçon au féminin
Une fille au masculin

Dans la rue, des tenues charmantes
Maquillées comme mon fiancé
Garçon, fille, l'allure stupéfiante
Habillée comme mon fiancé
Cheveux longs, cheveux blonds colorés
Toute nue dans une boîte en fer
Il est belle, il est beau, décrié
L'outragé mais j'en n'ai rien à faire

J'ai pas envie de la voir nue
J'ai pas envie de le voir nu
Et j'aime cette fille aux cheveux longs
Et ce garçon qui pourrait dire non

On se prend la main
Et on se prend la main
Un garçon au féminin
Une fille au masculin

Et on se prend la main
Et on se prend la main
Un garçon au féminin
Une fille au masculin

Des visages dans des cheveux d'or
Qui oublient leur vertu
Mais c'est pas vrai qu'ils ont l'air d'un conquistador
Asexués une fois dévêtus
Qui croire quand on les voit comme ça
Excitant toutes les petites filles ?
Pourquoi on n'y croit plus comme ça
Isolé dans un corps presqu'il ?

J'ai pas envie de la voir nue
J'ai pas envie de le voir nu
Et j'aime cette fille aux cheveux longs
Et ce garçon qui pourrait dire non

Et on se prend la main (On se prend la main)
Et on se prend la main (On se prend la main)
Un garçon au féminin
Une fille au masculin

Et eux ne valaient rien (On se prend la main)
Et eux ne valaient rien (On se prend la main)
Et on n'en a plus besoin
Et on n'en a plus besoin

Des robes longues pour tous les garçons
Habillés comme ma fiancée
Pour des filles sans contrefaçons
Maquillées comme ma fiancé
Le grand choc pour les plus vicieux
C'est bientôt la chasse aux sorcières
Ambiguë jusqu'au fond des yeux
Le retour de Jupiter

It's just a dream, a dream, I'm just having fun
It's just a song, song, I wanna fly
Quelque part au soleil

Et on se prend la main (On se prend la main)
Et on se prend la main (On se prend la main)
Un garçon au féminin
Une fille au masculin

Et eux ne valaient rien (On se prend la main)
Et eux ne valaient rien (On se prend la main)
Et on n'en a plus besoin
Et on n'en a plus besoin

Et on se prend la main
Et on se prend la main
On vit
Vit

// Christine (Paradis Remix) //

Je commence un livre par la fin
Et j'ai le menton haut pour un rien
Mon œil qui pleure c'est à cause du vent
Mes absences et du sentiment

[Refrain:]
Je ne tiens pas debout
Le ciel coule sur mes mains
Je ne tiens pas debout
Le ciel coule sur
Ça ne tient pas debout
Le ciel coule sur mes mains
Ça ne tient pas debout
Sous mes pieds le ciel revient

Ils sourient rouge et me parlent gris
Je fais semblant d'avoir tout compris
Et il y a un type qui pleure dehors
Sur mon visage de la poudre d'or

[Refrain]

Touché de près ou de loin
Le ciel et ses sous-terrains
Le corps défie le destin
De jouer ce qu'écrit le bouquin 
Les chevilles à l'air
Mécanique ondulaire
Tes cheveux agrumes, couronnant le costume 
Les poignets à l'air, mécanique en lumière 
Traçant les volumes
Des cicatrices que t'assumes et tu chantes

J'fais tout mon make-up
Au mercurochrome
Contre les pop-ups
Qui m'assurent le trône
[x4]

[Refrain]

Elle fait tout son make-up
Au mercurochrome
[x4]

// Comme L'oiseau //

Fais comme l'oiseau
Ça vit d'air pur et d'eau fraîche, un oiseau
D'un peu de chasse et de pêche, un oiseau
Mais jamais rien ne l'empêche, l'oiseau, d'aller plus haut

Je suis seul dans l'univers
J'ai peur du ciel et de l'hiver
J'ai peur des fous et de la guerre
J'ai peu du temps qui passe, dis
Comment peut-on vivre aujourd'hui
Dans la fureur et dans le bruit
Je ne sais pas, je ne sais plus, je suis perdu

Fais comme l'oiseau
Ça vit d'air pur et d'eau fraîche, un oiseau
D'un peu de chasse et de pêche, un oiseau
Mais jamais rien ne l'empêche, l'oiseau, d'aller plus haut

L'amour dont on m'a parlé
Cet amour que l'on m'a chanté
Ce sauveur de l'humanité
Je n'en vois pas la trace, dis
Comment peut-on vivre sans lui ?
Sous quelle étoile, dans quel pays ?
Je ne sais pas, je ne sais plus, je suis perdu

Fais comme l'oiseau
Ça vit d'air pur et d'eau fraîche, un oiseau
D'un peu de chasse et de pêche, un oiseau
Mais jamais rien ne l'empêche, l'oiseau, d'aller plus haut

J'en ai marre de me faire rouler
Par des marchands de liberté
Et d'écouter se lamenter
Ma gueule dans la glace, dis
Est-ce je dois serrer les dents ?
Est-ce que je dois baisser les bras ?
Je ne sais pas, je ne sais plus, je suis perdu

Fais comme l'oiseau
Ça vit d'air pur et d'eau fraîche, un oiseau
D'un peu de chasse et de pêche, un oiseau
Mais jamais rien ne l'empêche, l'oiseau, d'aller plus haut

// Eyes Of A Child //

She will come whenever I call her
But she'll leave as soon as I sigh
She's got the eyes of a child
And she'll love without any sorrow
For she just aims for the light
She's got the eyes of a child

She'll forgive and she'll be forgiven
For she's got the eyes of a child

And I love her because she's so brave
And I hate her because she fights
She's got the eyes of a child
What she wants, she always seems to have
What she hates, she just let it dies
She's got the eyes of a child

She forgot but I won't forget her
She's got the eyes of a child

What is it that's so bright about her
That made me so full of lies
She's got the eyes of a child
I recall I've never felt that young
She stole what's left of my heart
She's got the eyes of a child

I wish that I never met her
But she's got the eyes of a child

And I wish I never met her
She's got the eyes of a child

// Freedom //

I won't let you down
Will not give you up
Can I have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
'Cause I would really, really love to stick around
Oh, yes
(I want)

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be (Didn't know what I wanted to be)
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me (And I guess it was enough for me)

To win the race, a prettier face
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV (Rock and roll TV)
But today the way I play the game is not the same, no way
I think I'm gonna get me some happy

I think there's something you should know
(I think it's time I told you so)
There's something deep inside of me
(There's someone else I've got to be)
Take back your picture in a frame
(Take back your singing in the rain)
I just hope you understand
(Sometimes the clothes do not make the man)

Say, baby
All we have to do now (Now)
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I (Don't belong to you)
And you don't (Don't belong to me) yeah

Freedom (I won't let you down)
Freedom (I will not give you up)
Freedom (Gotta have some faith in the sound)
You've got to give what you take
(It's the one good thing that I've got)
Freedom (I won't let you down)
Freedom (So please don't give me up)
Freedom
('Cause I would really, really love to stick around)
You've got to give what you take
To the bridge

Well, it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

(That's what you get)
That's what you get
(That's what you get)
I say that's what you get
(That's what you get for changing your mind)
That's what you get for changing my mind
(That's what you get)
I say that's what you get
(That's what you get)
And I just hope you understand
(Sometimes the clothes do not make the man)

Oh, all we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I (Don't belong to you)
Oh, and you (Don't belong to me) yeah, yeah
Freedom (I won't let you down)
Freedom (I will not give you up)
Freedom (Gotta have some faith in the sound)
(You got to give what you take)
It's the one good thing that I've got

Freedom (I won't let you down)
Freedom (So please don't give me up)
Freedom ('Cause I would really, really love to stick around)
Freedom (Oh yeah)
Freedom (Oh yeah, I wanna be free)
Freedom (Oh yeah, a free man looking at you, can't you see?)
Freedom (Oh yeah)
Freedom
Freedom
(You got to give what you take)

You got to hold on
'Cause now I've got to live

// Gone //

I have to go, I'm so sorry, but it feels so cold in here
I am just now realizing they don't care
I try real hard, but I'm caught up by my insecurities
Pour me one more, watch the ice melt in my fist

I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people
How they making me feel lately
They making me weird, baby, lately
I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people
How they making me loathe
They making me loathe, yeah

Why do we keep when the water runs?
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Don't search me in here, I'm already gone, baby
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Why do we love?

I would lay down (Lay down)
But they staring, their eyes like two shining stones
I see myself (Myself), and I look scared and confused
Wait, did they just talk? Why is it too loud? (Is it loud?)
Do they wish to run through me? (Me)
Am I a smoke? Am I the sun? And who decides? (Oh)

I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people
How they making me feel lately
They making me weird, baby, lately
I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people
How they making me loathe
They making me loathe, oh, mmm (Yeah)

Why do we keep when the water runs?
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Don't search me in here, I'm already gone, baby (Baby)
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Don't search me in here, I'm already gone, baby

(Cruels endroits)
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Ne me cherche pas, je ne suis plus là, baby
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Ne me cherche pas, je ne suis plus là (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why do we? Ah

Keep, keep, k-keep the water running
Keep, k-keep, k-keep, k-keep the water run
Keep, k-keep, k-keep the
Keep, keep the, keep
Keep
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Keep, keep, keep
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Keep, keep, keep
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Keep
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Keep, keep, keep
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Keep, keep, keep
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Don't search me in here, I'm already gone, baby

// Jonathan //

[Perfume Genius:]
Oh Jonathan
Don't be angry Jonathan
Can you lay your hand on my forehead?
Through darkest nights
Can you handle the darkest nights?
At the crack of dawn I am ashamed
Oh sister, oh
Can you forgive me?
Sister old
Can you lay your hand on my forehead?

[Chorus - Perfume Genius + Christine and the Queens:]
Oooh oh
Oooh oh oh oh
Can you give it, give it, give it, give it, give it?
Oooh oh
Oooh oh oh oh
Can you give it, give it, give it, give it, give it?

Seulement la nuit
Et pourquoi seulement la nuit?
Je sais que tu ne répondras pas
Seulement ici
Et pourquoi seulement ici?
Est-ce qu'ailleurs je ne t'appartiens pas?
C'est interdit
Et pourquoi est-ce interdit?
Je te croyais au-dessus des lois
Ah ha ah ha ah ha ha
Ah ah ah ha ah ha

Can you give it, give it, give it, give it, give it?
Can you give it, give it, give it, give it, give it?
Oooh oh oh oh
Oooh oh

Can you walk with me in the daylight?
Can you walk with me in the daylight?
Can you walk with me in the daylight?
Je sais que tu ne répondras pas
Daylight
Oooh oh oooh
Est-ce qu'ailleurs je ne t'appartiens pas?
Oooh oh oooh oh
Je te croyais au-dessus des lois

// No Harm Is Done //

It's a blur
The pulsing is so loud, surely we'd feel better
If we had something to fight for
Oh, mother
I walk like a boy, mad at whoever
Would step on the game that he's just drew

If it's where we are, no harm is done yet
If it's where we are, then no harm is done yet
And if this is where you stand, then no harm is done yet
If it's where you stand, then no harm is done

Sure, we slur
Though we wrote it down
It's unclear and bitter
Tears and sweat can numb like melted snow
My anger
Once it's figured out, will finally matter
I'll pass it on to you, give it a go

If it's where we are, no harm is done yet
If it's where we are, then no harm is done yet
And if this is where you stand, then no harm is done yet
If it's where you stand, then no harm is done

[Tunji Ige:]
We lose control when we were meant to win
Don't lose the focus, never settle in
We could find a way and end the sin
Or I could go and be the better man
I can follow
Wanna take the lead but I roam all alone
With a heart so hollow
While you holding the lock and the key to my soul
I guess this is a plea to be free, written to someone soul
If this is where we are, then tell me just where should I go

If it's where we are, no harm is done yet
If it's where we are, then no harm is done yet
And if this is where you stand, then no harm is done yet
If it's where you stand, then no harm is done (yet)

// No Ordinary Love //

I gave you all the love I got
I gave you more than I could give
I gave you love
I gave you all that I have inside
And you took my love
You took my love

Didn't I tell you
What I believe
Did somebody say that
A love like that won't last
Didn't I give you
All that I've got to give baby

I gave you all the love I got
I gave you more than I could give
I gave you love
I gave you all that I have inside
And you took my love
You took my love

I keep crying
I keep trying for you
There's nothing like you and I baby

This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love

When you came my way
You brightened every day
With your sweet smile 

Didn't I tell you
What I believe
Did somebody say that
A love like that won't last
Didn't I give you
All that I've got to give baby 

This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love
This is no ordinary love
No ordinary love

// Saint Claude (English Version) //

So softly speaking
Your words' a constant babbling stream
Come from nowhere, where, where
Come from nowhere, where, where

You eyelids paint in chalk
Shimmering haze just as you talk
Are you sinking, king, king
Are you sinking, king, king

I see that your left arm is ink stained
And since you're sleeveless
Your winged lion gives a sly wink
Does he know my loneliness?

And then I steal a glimpse of your face 
As you turn the other way
Now I'll play your ghost as my ace
Whenever I'm led astray

Here's my station
Here's my station
But if you say just one word I'll stay with you
[x2]

Such an attitude 
Impatient, gloriously rude 
Are you for real, real, real
You're not for real, real, real

Every breath you take
Is a violent strain that breaks
Through their cursing, sing, sing
Through their cursing, sing, sing

Before you, I had nothing
But a handful of sad scents
And this town is dead my darling
You're the one that reinvents

With my lips sealed I say a prayer
"Long live the fool, kill the king"
I am offered newborn anger
And the storm will hear us sing

Here's my station
Here's my station
But if you say just one word I'll stay with you
[x2]

Pour que l'orage s'annonce...

// Tilted //

I die way before Methuselah
So I'll fight sleep with Ammonia
And every morning with eyes all red
I'll miss them for the tears they shed

But I'm actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted
I am actually good
Can't help it if we
I am actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted
I am actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted

I miss prosthesis and mended souls
Trample over beauty while singing their thoughts
I match them with my euphoria
When they said, "Je suis plus folle que toi."

But I'm actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted
I am actually good
Can't help it if we
I am actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted
I am actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted

Nous et la man on est de sortie
Pire qu'une simple moitié on compte à demi-demi
Pile sur un des bas côtés comme des origamis
Le bras tendu paraît cassé tout n'est qu'épis et éclis
Ces enfants bizarres
Crachés dehors comme par hasard
Cachant l'effort dans le griffoir
Et une creepy song en étendard qui fait:

I'm doing my face
With magic marker
I'm in my right place
Don't be a downer
I'm doing my face
With magic marker
I'm in my right place
Don't be a downer

I am actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted
I am actually good
Can't help it if we
I am actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted

I am actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted
I am actually good
Can't help it if we
I am actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted

I am actually good
Can't help it if we're tilted

// Would I Lie To You? //

Oh, oh-oh, oh, hmm

Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah?

Everybody wants to know the truth
In my arms is the only proof
I've hidden my heart behind the bedroom door
And now it's open, I can't do no more

I'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine (Oh, baby)

(Look) Look into my eyes (Look into my eyes), can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
(Look) Don't you know it's true (Look into my eyes), girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)

Everybody's got their history (History)
On every page a mystery (It's a mystery, ah)
You can read my diary, you're in every line
Jealous minds, never satisfied

I'm telling you, baby, you will never find another girl
In this heart of mine (Oh, baby)

(Look) Look into my eyes (Look into my eyes), can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? (Oh, yeah)
(Look) Don't you know it's true (Look into my eyes), girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)

(Look) Don't you know it's true (Look into my eyes), girl, there's no one else but you?
Would I lie to you, baby, yeah? (Would I lie to you?)
Oh, oh-oh
Come on, come on, come on
Look, look into my eyes
Oh would I lie? (Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you?)
Would I lie, baby? (Look, look into my eyes)
Oh, would I lie? (Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you?)
I would never lie to you, I would never lie to you
Look, look into my eyes (Look into my eyes)
I am not that man (Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you?)
Look into my eyes (Oh, oh yeah)
I would never lie to you
