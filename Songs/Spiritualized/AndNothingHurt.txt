// A Perfect Miracle //

I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle
I'd part the clouds and have the sun proudly shining on you
I'd take the stars as well and line them up to spell "Darling, I love you"
And little by little watch it all come true

I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle
I'd catch the wind and have it blow all my kisses to you
Take the birds and teach them all the words of every love song I know
And I'd have them fly around and sing them all to you

Darling, you know, I'm sorry
I won't get to see you today
My mind is a mess and I'm needing you less
Give me your call in a little while

I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle
'Cause every time I close my eyes I'm just dreaming of you
There ain't a man around can knock me off my cloud 'cause "Darling, I love you"
And little by little watch it all come true

Darling, you know, I'm sorry
I won't get to see this week
Lately I've found I don't need you around
Don't think it's working out anyway
Anyway I'd like

I'd like to sit around and dream you up a perfect miracle
'Cause you're the only girl I ever met who's honest and true
I'd like to settle down with you and mess around a house on the hill
And I'm sitting here and hoping it'll all come true

Darling, you know, I'm sorry
I won't get to see this fall
My phone has been broke and I thought that we'd spoke
Don't think it's working out anyway
Anyway

Darling, you know, I'm sorry
I won't get to see you this year
I hate to confess and I've changed my address
I haven't been home in a little while
Little while

Darling, you know, I'm sorry
I won't get to see you again
I met someone else, you should do it yourself
So darling please don't call
Please don't call

// I'm Your Man //

I could be faithful, honest and true
Holding my heart for you
Dependable all down the line
Devoted all the time

But if you want wasted, loaded, permanently folded
Doing the best that he can
I'm your man
I'm your man

Hold on all down the line
Faithful all the time
I'm waiting for a sign from you
I could be honest, constant and true

But if you want wasted, faded, uneducated
Doing the best that he can
I'm your man
I'm your man

I could faithful, honest and true
Holding my heart for you
Faithful all down the line
Devoted all the time

But if you want wasted, loaded, permanently folded
Doing the best that he can
I'm your man
I'm your man
I'm your man
I'm your man

// Here It Comes (The Road) Let's Go //

Hey baby it's alright
You can come to my house tonight
I'll give directions here
A couple of hours and you'll be near
Take the road right out of town
Check your gas and oil is sound
Watch the road you'll be alright
And you can drive right through the night

Here comes
The road let's go
The radio
As far as we can go
Here it comes
The road let's go
The radio
As far as we can go

Take the road down to the stream
Be sure to keep your licence clean
Better slow down for the lights
There's a cop up there who sits up all night
Take the hill in second gear
You can see my house from here
And the way my heart is beating
You'll hear the sound
It'll wake the sleeping

Here comes (here comes)
The road let's go (turn on)
The radio (let's go)
As far as we can go
Here it comes (here comes)
The road let's go (turn on)
The radio (let's go)
As far as we can go

Leave the car by the broken gate
Cut the engine pull the brake
Take a stroll along the path
You'll find my key beneath the mat
Throw your bag down the bed
Pull a comb across your head
Take a line, it'll be alright
And we'll get stoned all through the night

Here comes (here comes)
The road let's go (turn on)
The radio (let's go)
As far as we can go
Here it comes (here comes)
The road let's go (turn on)
The radio (let's go)
As far as we can go

// Let's Dance //

Though I'm tired just sitting here talking with you
There's better things y'know a lonely rock 'n' roller can do

The hour is getting late
They're putting all our dreams away

And lord have mercy on all of our thoughts today

I should get away
But I would rather stay and dance
C'mon darling let's dance

Although I'm tired just sitting here falling for you
There's better things y'know a lonely boy and girl can do

The hour is getting late
They're pulling all the curtains drawn
We got the rest of our lives 'til the coming dawn

Hold my hand awhile
We'll go out in style
And dance
C'mon darling let's dance
I'll say a little prayer for us girl
I'll say a little prayer for us girl

Though I'm tired just sitting here singing for you
There's better things y'know a lonely rock 'n' roller can do
The hour is getting late
They're putting all the chairs away
If they've got Big Star on the radio they'll let us stay

Oh, September girl
Come and rule my world
And dance

C'mon darling let's dance
C'mon baby let's dance
C'mon darling let's dance
C'mon baby let's dance
C'mon darling let's dance

I'll say a little prayer for us girl
I'll say a little prayer for us girl

Show a little love
I'll keep it close to mine and
Have a little heart

I'll keep my own in time and
Show a little love

I'll keep it close to mine
And dance

// On The Sunshine //

On the sunshine
In the morning
It's the dawning baby
Of a brand new precious day

And in the evening
Take it easy

You can always do tomorrow
What you cannot do today

In the morning light
Don't it feel alright

You can always shoot the messenger
The moment they arrive
And in the evening rain
Comin' round again

You can always count your blessings babe
Before the foul has laid
And though it's hard to see
Like the leaves from the trees
You can shake the monkey from your back
The circus never leaves

And in the morning light
All that wasted time
Cos it's only in the darkness
That the stars begin to shine

And in the faded light
All the angels sing
When you reach the ends
Of all your lines
Then tie a knot and swing

And save your bleedin' soul
Save your bleedin' soul

If youth is wasted on the young
Then wisdom on the old
And let it go
C'mon let it roll

State of mind
State of mind
State of mind

On the sunshine
In the morning
It's the dawning baby
Of a brand new precious day

And in the evening
Take it easy

You can always fix tomorrow
What you can't pull off today

And take it easy
All these wasted years
Celebrate your finest
And the music of the spheres

And take it easy
Take it easy

Take the monkey from your back
The circus never leaves
And let it go
Take it easy
If youth is wasted on the young
Then wisdom on the old
And take it easy
Take it easy

Open up that golden gate
And let it all arrive

Take it easy
Easy

State of mind
State of mind
State of mind

Take it easy
Easy

State of mind
State of mind
State of mind

Let it roll

// Damaged //

And I
Wanna just close my eyes
Feel like I'm living
Feel like I'm alive
Wrapped up in clover
And I'm safe from the tide
Feel like I'm floating
And I'm laid out in time
Darlin' I'm lost
And I'm damaged
Over you

And I
Wanna just close my mind
Feel like I'm floating
On ship out of time
Wrapped up and golden
Cos I made up my mind
Darlin' I'm lost
And I'm broken
Over you

And I
Wanna just take my time
Feel like I'm broken
And I'm laid out and dying
Wasted and stolen
Quell the cavalier child
Darlin' I'm lost
And I'm damaged
Over you

// The Morning After //

Jane said she had a problem with
The modern world
All the boys she ever loved are
With another girl
And her father always wanna
Bring her way down low and
All the doctors that she ever met have
Gotta way to go

Jane said she had a problem with
Her mother's wealth
Said she ought to cut and run
And grow up by herself
So, she wrote a letter to them on
The way to school
The way to school now

Said she cannot live her life
Under her father's rule

Don't call the morning after
Won't stop the pain and laughter
Won't fix the failing plan
You gotta pay the man
You gotta give it all away
And you have gotta go

Janey said she had a problem with
Her failing health
Said she's gonna fix it all up on
The National Health

She only got a couple of worries
Gotten out of hand and
When she tells her doctors that
They never understand

Don't call the morning after
Won't stop the pain and laughter
Won't help to pass the blame
You gotta take the pain
You gotta give it all away
And you have gotta go

Janey had a revelation on
The way to school
Said she's gonna hang herself
Up the bathing pool
She's really gonna lay it on them
Cos she always know that

Every mother wants to die before
Her children do

Don't call the morning after
Won't stop the big disaster
Don't miss the main event
You gotta pay the rent
You gotta give it all away
And you have gotta go
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon we're living
In the modern world

// The Prize //

Time
Lends you her shotgun for a while
Gonna be shooting like a star across the sky
Gonna burn brightly for a while
Then you're gone

And maybe
It's not too late to change your mind
But I don't know, dear
If love will live or if it'll die
And I don't know if love's a lie

And time
We've got a life and life's a prize
But I don't know, dear
If love, dear, will fall or if it'll rise
And I don't know if love's the prize

And maybe
It's not too late to say goodbye
But I don't know, dear
If love, dear, will care or if it don't mind
And I don't know if love's the prize
And I don't know if love's the prize
And I don't know if love's the prize

And maybe
It's just impossible to know
If I should stay here with you, dear
Stay or if I should go
And I don't know if love's to know

And maybe
I should get down on my knees and say
That I don't know anything or anymore
Than anyone else today
And I don't if love's the way

And maybe
You've got your dreams but rest assured
There's a whole lifetime ahead of you
To dash them on the shore
And I don't know if love's the cure
And I don't know if love's so pure
And I don't know if love's the prize

// Sail On Through //

I'll hold on tight I'll hold on
Was the best thing I could do for you
And when we have some kind of luck
Was like the sun send down from way above

I tell no lie, I tell the truth
You know I just don't need to be with you

If I could hold it down
I would sail on through for you
If I weren't loaded down
I would sail on through for you

Say no more, say no less
You know you took it all but you wanted less
I came on down i gave it all
You know best love lies before the fall

If I could hold it down
I would sail on through for you
If I weren't loaded down
I would sail on through for you
