// Sofi Needs A Ladder //

Let's play musical chairs, one of my favorite games
Especially now that you and I have traded place
You walk around in shoes that don't fit for a change
There is no way for you to win this race
Criss cross and turn your shirt inside out
You like to think I can't figure you out, but the tables have turned
What goes around comes around, you're about to get burned
Flip the script, you're checking in, I'm checking you out

You're just too sweet till you get on my nerves and hurt like cavity
You left a bad taste in my mouth, my Sour Patch Kid
You and me, it's no mystery, no magic trick
Let me hear this broken record again, just press repeat
I can be your new favorite waste of time, and you'll be mine
All I want is your attention, it's all the same thing
Are you in? What's it gonna be?
Don't roll with the punches, make it hard for me baby.

Drop you like a needle on the record, scratch my itch
Watch you walk in circles hit the beat
Drop you like a needle on the record, flip my switch
Go around in circles, hit the beat

[Chorus]

// Raise Your Weapon //

Rippin' my heart was so easy, so easy,
Launch your assault now, take it easy.

Raise your weapon, raise your weapon, one word and it's over.

Rippin' through like a missile,
Rippin' through my heart,
Rob me of this love.

Raise your weapon, raise your weapon... and it's over.

Love your ego, you won't feel a thing,
Always number one, the pen with a bent wrist crooked king,
Sign away our peace for your war,
One word and it's over.

Dropping your bombs now
On all we've built,
How does it feel now
To watch it burn, burn, burn?

Raise your weapon, raise your weapon... and it's over.

Rippin' through like a missile,
Rippin' through my heart,
Rob me of this love.

Raise your weapon, raise your weapon... and it's over.

How does it feel now to watch it burn, burn, burn?

Rippin' my heart was so easy, so easy,
Launch your assault now, take it easy.

Raise your weapon, raise your weapon, one word and it's over.

Rippin' through like a missile,
Rippin' through my heart,
Rob me of this love.

Raise your weapon, raise your weapon... and it's over.

Love your ego, you won't feel a thing,
Always number one, the pen with a bent wrist crooked king,
Sign away our peace for your war,
One word and it's over.

Dropping your bombs now
On all we've built,
How does it feel now
To watch it burn, burn, burn?

Raise your weapon, raise your weapon... and it's over.

// One Trick Pony //

Pump the brakes, you're a red-flag, red light
Holdin' up for stop signs. I'll never be sloppy seconds
Go ahead, take them back, your one, two, three minutes
All you do is take, take, takin' off the little
Got More goin' on I'd rather be eating glass, stick hot needles in my eyes, go ahead and tap that ass
Draw them up, yeah like there's candy
Girl I ain't tryin'a connect or paint a picture
I'm not in it, never will be
You can't be me, get your freak on, you can suck it, they've all seen it
And you liked it, now who wants it? 
Cotton candy sugar high
Break your bones when you come down
You're a one trick, my trick pony who's next to hop on
Ride, ride, ride...
Bout to bring a blood spill
We've both been there, what's the next stop? I won't sit still
Back to bring up what's real
We've both been there, what's the next stop? I won't sit still
