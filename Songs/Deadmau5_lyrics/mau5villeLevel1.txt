// Monophobia //

Inside my head, there's a little place left for you
What do you know?
What do you know?
And all I want is to find out what you're going through
What do I know?
Maybe this silence is dangerous

Inside my head, there's a little place left for you
What do you know?
What do you know?

And feel what's inside you
I wanna come over
And see what you've found
See if you're hurting
After tearing me down
It's the rain of denial

It's the way that you're faking
All the tears in your eyes
Feel like I'm in slow motion
Tonight

And all I want is to find out what you're going through
What do I know?
Maybe this silence is dangerous

I wanted to hide
Now, I just wanna find you
And feel what's inside you
I wanna come over
And see what you've found
See if you're hurting
After tearing me down
It's the rain of denial

// All Is Lost //

[nothing,nowhere.:]
I still see you when I'm sleeping
Every single evening
Underwater and I'm screaming
And nobody can hear me

You say you wanna see me
Like every other weekend
So when you say that you are leaving
You better fucking mean it

Funny how it changes
Memories and places
Time that I had wasted
Nights where you was faded

Always see your face and
I can't even take it
Someone sent to save me
I don't think I'll make it

Funny how it changes
Memories and places
Time that I had wasted
Nights where you was faded

Always see your face and
I can't even take it
Someone sent to save me
I don't think I'll make it

I don't think I'll make it, I don't think I'll make it
I, I don't think I'll make it, I don't think I'll make it
I, I don't think I'll make it, I don't think I'll make it
I, I don't think I'll make it, I don't think I'll make it

// Monophobia (ATTLAS Remix) //

Inside my head, there's a little place left for you
What do you know?
What do you know?
And all I want is to find out what you're going through
What do I know?
Maybe the silence is dangerous

Maybe the silence, silence, silence

// Monophobia (Extended Mix) //

Inside my head, there's a little place left for you
What do you know?
What do you know?
And all I want is to find out what you're going through
What do I know?
Maybe this silence is dangerous

I wanted to hide
Now, I just wanna find you
And feel what's inside you
I wanna come over
And see what you've found
See if you're hurting
After tearing me down
It's the rain of denial

Inside my head, there's a little place left for you
What do you know?
What do you know?
And all I want is to find out what you're going through
What do I know?
Maybe this silence is dangerous

I wanted to hide
Now, I just wanna find you
And feel what's inside you
I wanna come over
And see what you've found
See if you're hurting
After tearing me down
It's the rain of denial

Inside my head, there's a little place left for you
What do you know?
What do you know?
And all I want is to find out what you're going through
What do I know?
Maybe this silence is dangerous

I wanted to hide
Now, I just wanna find you
And feel what's inside you
I wanna come over
And see what you've found
See if you're hurting
After tearing me down
It's the rain of denial

Inside my head, there's a little place left for you
What do you know?
What do you know?
And all I want is to find out what you're going through
What do I know?
Maybe this silence is dangerous

I wanted to hide
Now, I just wanna find you
And feel what's inside you
I wanna come over
And see what you've found
See if you're hurting
After tearing me down
It's the rain of denial
