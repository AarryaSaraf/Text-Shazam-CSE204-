// The Oshawa Connection //

[Announcer:] Wow, beautiful. We're gonna go to our very first caller, we're going to Judy, line four, Oshawa, you're on the air. Hello Judy.
Asking the question, Judy, how has rejection affected your life?
[Judy:] This group of people, they rejected me. Like... like, they... they rejected me, one person in particular, but I don't wanna say his name.
[Announcer:] No.
[Judy:] 'cause... 'cause I... I've forgiven and forgotten about it.

I took a dive in Oshawa.

I took a dive in Oshawa. 

I took a dive in Oshawa. 

I took a dive in Oshawa.

I took a dive in Oshawa.

// Careless //

You're weak and you're gullible, and I don't care
You're a walking disaster, and I don't care
You cry yourself to sleep, and I don't care
You're wasting our time, and I don't care

You knew this day would come, and you did, and you really should have waited
Go cry yourself to sleep, and you should, because I'm so faded
You knew this day would come, and it did, and you really should have waited
Go cry yourself to sleep, and you should, because I'm so faded

You contradict everything, and I don't care
Your logic is twisted, and I don't care
I'll pretend to be happy, and I don't care
You cry yourself to sleep, and I don't care
You're weak and you're gullible, and I don't care
You're a walking disaster, and I don't care

You knew this day would come, and it did, and you should have waited
Go cry yourself to sleep, and you should, because I'm so faded
You knew this day would come, and it did, and you really should have waited
Go cry yourself to sleep, and you should, because I'm so faded
Go cry yourself to sleep, and you should, because I'm so faded

// Edit Your Friends //

Edit your friends
And have your fun
I'm the only person left
You still have not done

Edit your friends
Every single one
I'm the last one left
That you still haven't done

Edit your friends
Edit your friends
Edit your friends
Edit your friends
Edit your friends
Edit your friends

// Careless (Acoustic) //

You're weak and you're gullible,
and I don't care.

You're a walking disaster,
and I don't care.

You cry yourself to sleep,
and I don't care. 

You're wasting our time,
and I don't care.

You knew this day would come, and it did,
and you really should have waited. 

Go cry yourself to sleep, and you should,
because I'm so faded.

You knew this day would come, and it did, 
and you really should have waited. 

Go cry yourself to sleep, and you should,
because I'm so faded. 

You contradict everything,
and I don't care.

Your logic is twisted,
and I don't care.

I'll pretend to be happy,
and I don't care.

You cry yourself to sleep,
and I don't care.

You're weak and you're gullible,
and I don't care.

You're a walking disaster,
and I don't care.

You knew this day would come, and it did, 
and you really should have waited. 

Go cry yourself to sleep, and you should,
because I'm so faded. 

You knew this day would come, and it did, 
and you really should have waited. 

Go cry yourself to sleep, and you should,
because I'm so faded.
