// Alive //

I was the water and you were the boat
You said you're drowning, though I kept you afloat
I was the anchor when you needed ground
I wanted to hold you without holding you down

The memory of you won't let me go
It's there on the shore letting me know
The further you get, the closer I am
To finding a place I understand

Where will I feel alive?
Alive
Where will I feel alive?
Alive

We are closer than ever
We are closer than ever
We are closer than ever
We are closer than ever

Where will I feel alive?
Alive
Where will I feel alive?
Alive

We are closer than ever
We are closer than ever

// Sacrifice //

Do I love what I do
Even more than I love you? I might
When you're sick and hurting
And when you're celebrating your night
I'm an ocean away
I'm a time zone and two plane flights
Do I love what I do
Even more than I love you? I might

Will you sacrifice for me
If I don't sacrifice for you?
I won't be the one to let you go
But I'm not giving you anything to hold on to
I miss you and I'm sorry
You've become my number two
But will you sacrifice for me
If I won't sacrifice for you?

La lalalalalalalalalalala la
Lalala lalalalalalalalalalala la

Stick it out with me
I'm not leaving you behind
I know you're busy
I know you also have a life
It's a pity that I don't like your city
And you don't like mine
Stick it out with me
I'm not leaving you behind

Will you sacrifice for me
If I don't sacrifice for you?
I won't be the one to let you go
But I'm not giving you anything to hold on to
I miss you and I'm sorry
You've become my number two
But will you sacrifice for me
If I won't sacrifice for you?

La lalalalalalalalalalala la
Lalala lalalalalalalalalalala la
La lalalalalalalalalalala la
Lalala lalalalalalalalalalala la

// Escape //

I'm not invisible to you
Do my eyes, do my eyes speak true?
My soul so in touch with yours tonight
Won't let my head, let my head take flight

We could leave this place
Freedom ours to chase
What if I escape with you?

What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?
What if I escape?

Is it real? Is it just a fantasy?
'Cause the unknown, the unknown's pulling me

We could leave this place
Freedom ours to chase
What if I escape with you?

What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?

What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?

// Bright Lights //

Disco lights in the sky
Shining down, open your diamond eyes
Feel that glow, then you'll know
That you can come alive (Can come alive)
Shards of glass miles above
Rivers forming in the shape of us
Feel that glow, then you'll know
That you can come alive (Come alive)

There's a place we can go for a feeling
Where the bright lights take you over
Bright lights take you over
There's a place we can go for a feeling
Where the bright lights take you over
Bright lights take you over

Bright lights take you over
Bright lights take you over

There's a place we can go for a feeling
Where the bright lights take you over
Bright lights take you over
There's a place we can go for a feeling
Where the bright lights take you over
Bright lights take you over

There's a place we can go for a feeling
Where the bright lights take you over
Bright lights take you over
There's a place we can go for a feeling
Where the bright lights take you over
Bright lights take you over

// pwdr Blu //

Please stop me now
I ain't over you
Filter to block it out
You're powder blue
Pulling the darkness down
I needed something new
A feeling to talk around
Comfortable familiar you

You're powder blue
You're powder blue

Tell me I was wrong
Tell me what to do
Maybe I cut you out
Maybe I see this through
No one to stop me now
I'm over you
Finally figured out
You're powder blue

Please stop me now
I'm over you
Finally figured out
You're powder blue
No one to stop me now
I'm over you
Finally figured out
You're powder blue

You're powder blue
You're powder blue

// When I Talk //

Is it better when I go
And leave you on your own?
Is it really what you want?
Is it somethin' that I said
That makes you turn your head
And leave me in the cold?

Do you hear me when I talk?
Or recognize me from my fault?
Never see me through your wall
Oh

Do you hear me when I talk?
Do you hear me? (When I talk)
Do you hear me when I talk?
'Cause I feel that you don't
Do you hear me when I talk?
'Cause I want to know, to know

Do you hear me when I talk?
Or recognize me from my fault?
Never see me through your wall
Oh
Do you hear me when I talk?
Or recognize me from my fault?
Never see me through your wall
Oh

Oh

Do you hear me when I talk?
Do you hear me? (When I talk)
Do you hear me?
'Cause I feel that you don't
Do you hear me when I talk?
'Cause I want to know, to know

Do you hear me when I talk?
Or recognize me from my fault?
Never see me through your wall
Oh

// Eat Sleep //

All the things you did without me
Is it fair to say we're done?
Chop and change between your feelings
Are we too far gone?

Love, you
Haven't been off my mind
Don't know how to move on
Saw the signs in your eyes
Didn't know what I'd done
Don't know what I should say
Baby, all that I do
Is eat, sleep, think of you
Baby, all that I do

Eat, sleep, think of you

All the things you did without me
Is it fair to say we're done?
Chop and change between your feelings
Are we too far gone?

Love, you
Haven't been off my mind
Don't know how to move on
Saw the signs in your eyes
But didn't know what I'd done
Don't know what I should say
Baby, all that I do
Is eat, sleep, think of you
Baby, all that I do

Eat, sleep, think of you

Come on

Come on, take me up

Take me up
Come on, take me up
Take me high

Take me up
Come on, take me up
Take me high
Take me up
Come on, take me up
Take me high
Take me up
Come on, take me up
Take me high

Take me high

Come on, take me up

Take me up
Come on, take me up
Take me high
Take me up

Take me up
Come on, take me up
Take me high

// Avalanche //

It hits me, an avalanche
A flash freeze, never stood a chance
On my own to learn the cold
So far gone when you're in control
Say what you want, I
Say what you want, I

Say what you want, I

It hits me, an avalanche
A flash freeze, never stood a chance
So bury me, under your snow
Under your (Ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)

No light
Both arms surrounded by old white
Wrapped round, you going snow-blind
Addicted to getting your first bite (Ooh)
On my own to learn the cold
So far gone when you're in control
Say what you want, I

It hits me, an avalanche
A flash freeze, never stood a chance
So bury me, under your snow
Under your (Ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
Say what you want, I
Say what you want, I

Say what you want, I
