// Sometimes I Fail //

So we've been talking about 'cool' and its uh ramifications, and how it applies to the hip scene. But maybe you could give us some examples now, of the opposite of cool - 'uncool', just exactly what is 'uncool'?
Yeah, why-n't-we have some thoughts on that...

It-it-it's uncool to nod on the street corner waiting for the light to change.
And uh it uh... It-it's uncool to let anybody know your uncle is a registered pharmacist, uncool for the whole family.
You know, it's uncool to buddy with a known fink.
And it's uncool to ask "Where d'you get it?"
It's disastrously uncool to let friends use your penthouse as a porting address for packages from Mexico.
You know and it's uncool to ask "Where d'you get it?"
And it is uncool to wear shades after sunset.

Now you feel the power of Digitol...

// Screen Door //

She caught your eye like one of those pointy hook latches
That used to dangle from screen doors and would fly up
Whenever you bang the door open again

She spoke with the wisdom that can only come from experience
Like a woman who went blind
Because she looked at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes
With pinhole in it and now goes around the country speaking at high schools about
The dangers of looking at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes
With a pinhole in it

Her vocabulary was "as bad as, like, whatever"
Her eyes were like two brown circles with two black dots in the center

We had never met
We were like two hummingbirds who had also never met

And I miss her already
