// Survivalism (Deadmau5 Remix) //

I should have listened to her
So hard to keep control
We kept on eating but our
Bloated bellies still not full
She gave us all she had but
We went and took some more
Can't seem to shut her legs our
Mother nature is a whore

I got my propaganda I got revisionism
I got my violence in high def ultra-realism
All a part of this great nation
I got my fist I got my plan I got survivalism

Hypnotic sound of sirens
Echoing through the street
The cocking of the rifles
The marching of the feet
You see your world on fire
Don't try to act surprised
We did just what you told us
Lost our faith along the way and found ourselves believing your lies

I got my propaganda I got revisionism
I got my violence in high def ultra-realism
All a part of this great nation
I got my fist I got my plan I got survivalism

All bruised and broken bleeding
She asks to take my hand
I turn and keep on walking
What you'd do the same thing in the circumstance I'm sure you understand

I got my propaganda I got revisionism
I got my violence in high def ultra-realism
All a part of this great nation
I got my fist I got my plan I got survivalism

// Monday //

Nobody's wrong, nobody's right
Everyone cheats, everyone lies
Nobody cares, nobody minds
Night turns to day
And then the sun shines
and the sun shines
and the sun shines...

Nobody's wrong nobody's right
Everyone cheats everyone lies
Nobody cares nobody minds
Night turns to day
And then the sun shines
and the sun shines
and the sun sines
and the sun shines...

// Seeya //

Don't wake me up, I'm winning wars inside my head
And maybe I'm weak but not beneath the covers of this bed
Asleep, I'm undefeated in this world of mine
So let me stay inside this dream and keep me from the light

I've built this place behind my eyes you'll never see
And you can move my body but please keep my mind asleep
Beyond the galaxies where there's no space or time
I will transform, I am reborn to rule over the skies

I, I feel it in my bones
Escape, the world I know
It's all in my control
I, I just wanna stay this way
Blood pumping in my veins
I feel it, I feel it

Behind the darkness there's a sea of neon light
And maybe you think I'm sinking, but you just can't get inside
Don't try to save me when my mind is finally free
Cause I'd rather run my own world than face your reality

It's not enough for me to paint with black and white
Inside my head there are shades of red unknown to waking life
You think you've traveled far? You've never seen the stars
Cause the only the way is if I say you can follow me that far

I, I feel it in my bones
Escape, the world I know
It's all in my control
I, I just wanna stay this way
Blood pumping in my veins
I feel it, I feel it
