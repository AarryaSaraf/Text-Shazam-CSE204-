// Wrathchild //

I was born into a scene of angriness and greed
Dominance and persecution
My mother was a queen, my dad I've never seen
I was never meant to be
And now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around

'Cause I'm a wrathchild
I'm a wrathchild
Ah, I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh yeah, yeah

Oh... yeah!

Say it doesn't matter, ain't nothin' gonna alter
The course of my destination
I know I've got to find some serious piece of mind
Or I know I'll just go crazy
But now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around

'Cause I'm a wrathchild
Well, I'm a wrathchild
Yeah, I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh yeah, yeah

Yeah!

// Murders In The Rue Morgue //

I remember it as plain as day
Although it happened in the dark of the night
I was strolling through the streets of Paris
And it was cold it was starting to rain
And then I heard a piercing scream
And I rushed to the scene of the crime
But all I found was the butchered remains
Of two girls lay side by side

Murders in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Flee before the killers go free

There's some people coming down the street
At last someone heard my call
Can't understand why they're pointing at me
I never done nothing at all
But I got some blood on my hands
Because everyone's shouting at me
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain
And like a fool I started running away

Murder in the Rue Morgue
Someone call the Gendarmes
Murder in the Rue Morgue
Am I ever gonna be free?

And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law
All France is looking for me
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure
Down the south to Italy

Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm running from the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm never coming home

Well, I made it to the border at last
But I can't erase the scene from my mind
Anytime somebody stares at me, well
I just start running blind
Well, I'm moving through the shadows at night
Away from the staring eyes
Any day they'll be looking for me
'Cause I know I show the signs of

Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm running from the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Running from the arms of the law

Murders in the Rue Morgue
Running from the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
Am I ever gonna be free?

It took so long and I'm getting so tired
I'm running out of places to hide
Should I return to the scene of the crime
Where the two young victims died
If I could go to somebody for help
To get me out of trouble for sure
But I know that inside my mind
Well, I've got to say I've done it before

Murders in the Rue Morgue
They're never gonna find me
Murders in the Rue Morgue
I'm never going home

// Another Life //

As I lay here lying on my bed
Sweet voices come into my head
Oh, what it is, I want to know
Please, won't you tell me? It's got to go
There's a feeling that's inside me
Telling me to get away
But I'm so tired of living
I might as well end today

As I lay here lying on my bed
Sweet voices come into my head
Oh, what it is, I want to know
Please, won't you tell me? It's got to go
There's a feeling that's inside me
Telling me to get away
But I'm so tired of living
I might as well end today

As I lay here lying on my bed
Sweet voices come into my head
Oh, what it is, I want to know
Please, won't you tell me? It's got to go
There's a feeling that's inside me
Telling me to get away
But I'm so tired of living
I might as well end today

// Innocent Exile //

My life is so empty, nothing to live for
My mind is all confusion, 'cause I defied the law
When you weren't there to help me, I lost my mind and ran
I never had no trouble before this all began

My life is so empty, nothing to live for
My mind is all confusion, 'cause I defied the law
When you weren't there to help me, I lost my mind and ran
I never had no trouble before this all began

I'm running away, nowhere to go
I'm lost and tired and I just don't know. Yeah
They say I killed a woman, they know it isn't true
They're just trying to frame me, and all because of you. Yeah

// Killers //

Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Ow! Yeah!
Oh yeah!
Ow! Yeah!
Ooh, look out!

You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs

My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me

I can see what a life's meant to be
And you'll never know how I came to foresee, see, see

My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike

The death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light!
I have found you, and now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?!
Oh yeah, I've done it again!
Yeah!

You walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, my blood lust defies all my needs
Oh look out, I'm coming for you!
Aha ha ha ha!

Oh! Oh!

// Prodigal Son //

Listen to me, Lamia, listen to what I've got to say
I've got these feelings and they won't go away
I've got these fears inside that'll bring me to my knees
Oh, help me, Lamia, or I'm sure I'll die, oh, please

I feel unsettled, now I know that I've done wrong
I've messed around with mystic things and magic for far too long
I feel I'm being paid with this nightmare inside me
The devil's got a hold on my soul and he just won't let me be

I'm on my knees, oh, help me, please
I'm on my knees, help me please

Oh, Lamia, please try to help me
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be
Lamia, I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad
The devil's got a hold of my soul, he's driving me mad
Oh

Oh, Lamia, please try to help me
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be
Lamia, I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad
The devil's got a hold of my soul, he's driving me mad
Oh

// Purgatory //

Thinking of an age old dream
Places I have never seen
Fantasies lived times before
I split my brain, melt through the floor
Over clouds my mind will fly
Forever now I can't think why
My body tries to leave my soul
Is it me, I just don't know
Memories rising from the past
The future's shadow's overcast
Something's clutching at my head
Through the darkness, I'll be led

Oh, another time, another place
Oh, another smile on another face
When you see me floating up beside you
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you
Please take me away, take me away, so far away
Please take me away, take me away, so far away
Please take me away, take me away, so far away, hey!

Thinking of an age old dream
Places I have never seen
Fantasies lived times before
I split my brain, melt through the floor
Over clouds my mind will fly
Forever now, I can't think why
My body tries to leave my soul
Or is it me, I just don't know
Memories rising from the past
The future's shadow's overcast
Something's clutching at my head
Through the darkness, I'll be led

Oh, another time, another place
Oh, another smile on another face
When you see me walking up beside you
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you
Please take me away, take me away, so far away
Please take me away, take me away, so far away
Please take me away, take me away, so far away!

// Twilight Zone //

She lays in bed at night and that is when I make my call
But when she stares at me, she can't see nothing at all
Because, you see, I can't take no shape or form
It's been three long years since I've been gone

I can't get used to purgatory, you know it really makes me cry
I'll never know the reason why I had to go
Oh, oh, I'm crying
Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me
Oh, oh, oh, can't you see me?
Ah can't you see me?

I'm looking forward to her spirit coming over to me
I feel tempted to bring her over to see just what it's
Like to be hanging on the other side
I feel so lonely, it's a long time since I died

I try to show her that she's never gonna be alone
Because my spirit is imprisoned in the twilight zone
Oh, oh, I'm crying
Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me
Oh, oh, oh, can't you hear me?
Ah can't you see me?

// Drifter //

Walk away, yeah!

Look out now, baby, won't you take me away?
Sitting here, think it's gonna be a new day
Gonna get my song and I can't go wrong
Gotta keep on roaming, gotta sing my song

What you feeling when you hold me tight?
I wanna cuddle up to you tonight
Gonna get you feeling so secure
Listen, child, don't you see there's a cure?
Anyway, got to get you away
Feels so good, think it's gonna be a new day
I'm gonna get my song till it can't go on
I'm gonna keep on roaming, gonna sing my song

Ooh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh hoo
Ooh yeah
Oh, oh, oh
I keep on drifting

What you feeling when you hold me tight?
I wanna cuddle up to you tonight
Gonna get you feeling so secure
Listen, child, don't you see there's a cure?
Anyway, got to get you away
Feels so good, think it's gonna be a new day
I'm gonna get my song till it can't go on
I'm gonna keep on roaming, gonna sing my song
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh yeah

I'm gonna sing my song, yeah
And it won't take long
I'm gonna sing my song, yeah
I want you to sing along
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along
'Cause I'm a drifter
Drifting on
Yeah!
