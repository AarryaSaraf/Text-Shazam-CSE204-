Album: NoPrayerForTheDying

// Tailgunner //

Trace your way back fifty years
To the glow of Dresden, blood and tears
In the black above by the cruel searchlight
Men will die and men will fight, yeah

Who shot who and who fired first?
Dripping death to whet the bloodlust
No radar lock on, skin and bone
The bomber boys are going home

Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner

Nail that Fokker, kill that son
Gonna blow your guts out with my gun
The weather forecast's good for war
Cologne and Frankfurt? Have some more, ha ha ha!

Tail end Charlie in the boiling sky
The Enola Gay was my last try
Now that this Tailgunner's gone
No more bombers, one big bomb, yeah hey, ooh

Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner
Climb into the sky, never wonder why
Tailgunner, you're a Tailgunner

// Holy Smoke //

Believe in me and send no money
I died on the cross, that ain't funny
But my so called friends they're making me a joke
They missed out what I said like I never spoke

They choose what they wanna hear, don't tell a lie
They just leave out the truth as they're watching you die
Saving your soul by taking your money
Flies around shit, bees around honey

Holy smoke, holy smoke
There's plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke
This is thirsty work making holy smoke, yeah
Making holy smoke

Jimmy Reptile and all his friends
Say they gonna be with you at the end
Burning records, burning books
Holy soldiers, Nazi looks

Crocodile smiles, just wait awhile
Till the TV queen gets her make up clean
I've lived in filth, I've lived in sin
And I still smell cleaner than the shit you're in

Holy smoke, holy smoke
There's plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke
This is thirsty work making holy smoke, yeah
Holy smoke, smells good

They ain't religious but they ain't no fools
When Noah built his Cadillac, it was cool
Two by two they're still going down
And the satellite circus just left town
I think they're strange and when they're dead
They can have a Lincoln for their bed
Friend of the president, trick of the tail
Now they ain't got a prayer, 100 years in jail

Holy smoke, holy smoke
Plenty bad preachers for the devil to stoke
Feed 'em in feet first, this is no joke
This is thirsty work making holy smoke. Yeah
Holy smoke

// No Prayer For The Dying //

There are times when I've wondered
And times when I've cried
When my prayers, they were answered
At times when I've lied
But if you asked me a question
Would I tell you the truth?
Now there's something to bet on
You've got nothing to lose, yeah

When I've sat by the window
And gazed at the rain
With an ache in my heart
But never feeling the pain
And if you would tell me
Just what my life means
Walking a long road
Never reaching the end

God, give me the answer to my life
God, give me the answer to my dreams
God, give me the answer to my prayers
God, give me the answer to my being

// Public Enema Number One //

Ah ha!

When it all comes down the line
And the lights, they turn to greed
And you race off with your tyres screaming
Rolling thunder
And the people choke with poison
Children cry in fear
But you've got one last bullet
One way ticket out of here

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

In the cities, in the streets
There's a tension you can feel
The breaking strain is fast approaching
Guns and riots
The politicians gamble
And lie to save their skins
And the press get fed their scapegoats
Public enema number one

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

A million network slaves
In an advertising new age
I don't need a crystal ball to sell you
Your children have more brains
Than your drug infested remains
California dreaming as the earth dies screaming

Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak
Fall on your knees today
And pray the world will mend its ways
Get to your feet again
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain

Mm, what ho!

// Fates Warning //

Why is it some of us are destined to stay alive?
And some of us are here just so that we'll die?
How come the bullet hits the other guy?
Do we have to try and reason why?

Be it the Devil or be it Him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up, you'll know
Not just one power runs the show

Are we the lucky ones saved for another day
Or they the lucky ones who are taken away?
Is it a hand on your shoulder from the Lord above
Or the Devil himself come to give you a shove?

Be it the Devil or be it Him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up, you'll know
Not just one power runs the show

A volcano erupts and sweeps a town away
A hurricane devastates the cities in its way
The grief and misery for the ones that are left behind
The worst is yet to come, a Hell to face mankind

Be it the Devil or be it Him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up, you'll know
Not just one power runs the show

// The Assassin //

Now the contract's out
They've put the word about
I'm coming after you
It's not the money I make
It's the thrill of the chase
And I'm coming after you
I watch your every move
Study the things you do
And the pattern of your ways
I watch the way you walk
I hear your telephone talk
I want to understand the way you think

Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, better watch out
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, better watch out

Assassin, assassin
Assassin, assassin
Ha! Ha ha ha

I'm in a cold, cold sweat
I taste the smell of death
I know the moment's getting closer
And as you walk to the light
I feel my hands go tight
Excitement running though my veins
I've got you in my sights
I've got you dead to rights
The trigger's waiting for my finger
I feel adrenaline rush
It's just the final touch
And you can kiss your ass goodbye

Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, better watch out
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, 'cause I'm the assassin
Better watch out, better watch out

Assassin

// Run Silent Run Deep //

The convoy lights are dead ahead
The merchantmen lay in their bed
The thump of diesels hammer down
In the oily sea, the killing ground
Knuckles white, eyes alight
He slams the hatch on the deadly night
A cunning fox in the chicken's lair
A hound of Hell and the Devil don't care

Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below
Running silent, running deep
Sink into your final sleep

Chill the hearts of fighting men
In open ocean wondering when
The lethal silver fish will fly
This boat will shiver, men will die
A cast of millions, a part to play
Killer, victim, fool for the day?
Obeying an order, men have to die
Us or them, a well-rehearsed lie

Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below
Running silent, running deep
Sink into your final sleep

The lifeboat's shattered, the hull is torn
The tar black smell of burning oil
On the way down to Davy Jones
Every man for himself, you're on your own
The wolf eyes watch the crossfire
Stern tubes ready, aim and fire
They can pin some medal on your chest
Ah, in two more weeks, dead like the rest

Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare
A silent death lies waiting for all of you below
Running silent, running deep
Sink into your final sleep

Running silent, running deep
We are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep
A merchantman's nightmare

// Hooks In You //

I got the keys to view at number twenty-two
Behind my green door there's nothing to see
Is that a feature? What kind of creature
Would hang around waiting for a guy like me?
Stone cold sober and sitting in silence
Laid back and looking for sympathy
I like a girl who knows where she's bound
I don't like girls who've been hanging around

Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in

She's tied up, she can't come to the phone
You must have got your wires crossed, she ain't home
Knock on wood, you know I like that sound
She never could keep her feet on the ground

Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in

Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you, in you
Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you, in you

Oh yeah, yeah yeah

Right on the money, got it wrapped up tight
Got new ideas for the decor tonight
Make this house a preservation zone
Gonna set her in concrete, set her up on her own

Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in
Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well-hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in

Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you
Hooks in you
I've got those hooks in you
Hooks in you
I've got those
Hooks in you

// Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter //

Honey, it's getting close to midnight
And all the myths are still in town
True love and lipstick on your linen
Bite the pillow, make no sound
If there's some living to be done
Before your life becomes your tomb
You'd better know that I'm the one
Unchain your back door
Invite me around

Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

Let her go!

Honey, it's getting close to daybreak
The sun is creeping in the sky
No patent remedies for heartache
Just empty words and humble pie
So get down on your knees, honey
Assume an attitude
You just pray that I'll be waiting
'Cause you know, you know I'm coming soon

Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

So pick up your foolish pride
No going back
Nowhere, no way, no place to hide
Let her go

Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter
To the slaughter

Bring your daughter
Fetch your daughter
Bring your daughter
Fetch your daughter
Bring your daughter
Fetch your daughter
To the slaughter

Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go

Bring your daughter
Bring your daughter to the slaughter
Let her go, let her go, let her go
Gonna get you!

// Mother Russia //

Mother Russia, how are you sleeping?
Middle winter cold winds blow
From the trees the snowflakes drifting
Swirling 'round like ghosts in the snow

Mother Russia, poetry majestic
Tells the tale of a great empire
Turning 'round, the old man ponders
Reminiscing an age gone by

Mother Russia, dance of the tsars
Hold up your heads, be proud of what you are
Now it has come, freedom at last
Turning the tides of history and your past

Mother Russia, dance of the tsars
Hold up your heads, remember who you are
Can you release the anger, the grief?
Can you be happy now your people are free?
