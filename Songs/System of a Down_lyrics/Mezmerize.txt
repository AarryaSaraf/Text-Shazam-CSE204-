// Soldier Side - Intro //

Welcome, to the soldier side,

Where theres no one here but me....

People all grow up to die,

There is no one here but me.


Woooooooo

// B.Y.O.B. //

Why do they always send the poor?

Barbarisms by Barbaras
With pointed heels
Victorious, victories kneel
For brand new spankin' deals
Marching forward hypocritic
And hypnotic computers

You depend on our protection
Yet you feed us lies from the table cloth

La, la la, la la, la la, la la

Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

Kneeling roses disappearing
Into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox
Stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil
Crying, "Freedom!"

Handed to obsoletion
Still you feed us lies from the table cloth

La, la la, la la, la la, la la

Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

Blast off. It's party time
And we don't live in a Fascist nation
Blast off. It's party time
And where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?

Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?

Kneeling roses disappearing
Into Moses' dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox
Stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil
Crying, "Freedom!"

Handed to obsoletion
Still you feed us lies from the tablecloth

La, la la, la la, la la, la la

Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sun

Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?

Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
They always send the poor
They always send the poor

I can't see your souls through through your eyes

The crying walls of sliding architecture

Kidnapped by the likes of pure conjecture

Upholstery loving men all dwelling in the wells

Kidnapped by the likes of pure conjecture

// Sad Statue //

Conquest to the lover,
And your love to the fire,
Permanence unfolding in the absolute.

Forgiveness is
The ultimate sacrifice.
Eloquence belongs,
To the conqueror.

The pictures of time and space are rearranged,
In this little piece of typical tragedy.

Justified Candy!
Brandy for the nerves,
Eloquence belongs,
To the conqueror.

You and me will all go down in history,
With a sad Statue of Liberty,
And a Generation that didn't agree.

You and me will all go down in history,
With a sad Statue of Liberty,
And a Generation that didn't agree.

I forgot to
I forgot to let you know that...

To the conqueror.

And your love to the fire,
Permanence unfolding in the absolute.

What is in us that turns a deaf ear to the cries of human suffering?!!!

You and me will all go down in history,
With a sad Statue of Liberty,
And a Generation that didn't agree.

// Lost In Hollywood //

[Daron moans a little bit]

I'll wait here,
You're crazy,
Those vicious streets are filled with strays,
You should have never gone to Hollywood.

They find you,
Two-time you,
Say you're the best they've ever seen,
You should have never trusted Hollywood.

I wrote you,
And told you,
You were the biggest fish out here,
You should have never gone to Hollywood.

They take you,
And make you,
They look at you in disgusting ways,
You should have never trusted Hollywood.

[Serj moans now]

I was standing on the wall,
Feeling ten feet tall,
All you maggots smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard,
This is my front page,
This is my new age,
All you bitches put your hands in the air and wave them like you just don't care.

All you maggots smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard.

All you bitches put your hands in the air and wave them like you just don't care.

Phony people come to pray,
Look at all of them beg to stay,
Phony people come to pray.

[Serj and Daron Harmonize]

(The lines in the letter said, "We have gone to Hackensack")
Look at all of them beg to stay

Phony people come to pray.

All you maggots smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard,
All you maggots smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard.
All you maggots smoking fags out there on Hollywood Boulevard.

You should have never trusted Hollywood.
You should have never gone to Hollywood.

All you bitches put your hands in the air and wave them like you just don't care.

You should have never trusted Hollywood.
