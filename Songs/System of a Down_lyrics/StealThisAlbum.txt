// Innervision //

I have a home
Longing to roam
I have to find you
I have to meet you

Signs of your face
Slowing your pace
I need your guidance
I need to seek my innervision
Innervision

My pupils dance
Lost in a trance
Your sacred silence
Losing all violence

Stars in their place
Mirror your face
I need to find you
I need to seek my innervision
Innervision.

It's never too late to reinvent the bicycle
A smile brings forth energy or life
Giving your force

It's never too late to reinvent the bicycle
A smile brings forth energy or life
Giving your force
Vision

There is only one true path to life
the road that leads to all, leads to one
(Innervision, innervision)
There is only one true path to life
the road that leads to one.
Innervision.

Your sacred silence,
Losing all violence.

// Bubbles //

Fish that don't drown,
Life in a bubble jungle,
I wouldn't frown,
Not short another chuckle,
Snake in the ground,
But I was in there for you,
Now leaving town,
Life in a bubble jungle.

Seeing you believing
Us adhering
We're the power struck.

Believing, then kneeling,
Appeasing,
The power struggle.

We're left with no arms,
Right in the power struggle,
We're left with no arms,
Right in the power struggle.

Wearing a crown,
Life in a bubble jungle,
Chasing a clown,
Not short another chuckle,
Snake in the ground,
But I was waiting for you,
Now we have found,
Life in a bubble jungle.

Seeing you believing
Us adhering
We're the power struck.

Believing, then keeling,
Appeasing,
The power struggle.

We're left with no arms,
Right in the power struggle,
We're left with no arms,
Right in the power struggle.
Left with no arms,
In the power struggle,
Left with no arms,
In the power struggle.

May I remind you,
May I remind you,
May I remind you.

May I remind you,
May I remind you,
May I remind you.

May I remind you,
May I remind you,
May I remind you,
May I remind you,
May I remind you,
May I remind you,
Your life is in a bubble jungle.

Seeing you believing
Us adhering
We're the power struck.
Believing, then keeling,
Appeasing,
The power struggle.

We're left with no arms,
Right in the power struggle,
We're left with no arms,
Right in the power struggle.
Left with no arms,
In the power struggle,
Left with no arms,
Right here in the power struggle.

// Boom! //

I've been walking through your streets,
Where all your money's earning,
Where all your building's crying,
And clueless neckties working,
Revolving fake lawn houses,
Housing all your fears,
Desensitized by TV,

Overbearing advertising,
God of consumerism,
And all your crooked pictures,
Looking good, mirrorism,
Filtering information,
For the public eye,
Designed for profiteering,
Your neighboor, what a guy.

Boom, boom, boom, boom,
Every time you drop the bomb,
You kill the god your child has born.
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

Modern globalization,
Coupled with condemnations,
Unnecessary death,
Matador corporations,
Puppeting your frustrations,
With the blinded flag,

Manufacturing consent
Is the name of the game,
The bottom line is money,
Nobody gives a fuck.
4000 hungry children leave us per hour from starvation,
While billions are spent on bombs,
Creating death showers.

Boom, boom, boom, boom,
Every time you drop the bomb,
You kill the god your child has born.
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

Why must we kill our own kind?

Boom, boom, boom, boom,
Every time you drop the bomb,
You kill the god your child has born.

Boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Every time you drop the bomb.

// NÃ¼guns //

And the little boy stared
Into the eyes of the night,
Button collects price of his time,
Little girl glared,
Sheets of the denial,
Bullet connects to the price of her crime.

What have we said,
Wasn't it their bed,
What of presence,
Haven't we paid penance,
For the new guns.

Now the little boy sees
Through the eyes of delight,
Levers erect note of his rhyme,
Little girl bled,
Sheets of the night,
Lovers connect to the price of his dime.

What have we said,
Wasn't it their bed,
What of presence,
Haven't we paid penance,
To the new guns, to the new guns.

What have we said,
Wasn't it their bed,
What of presence,
Haven't we paid penance,

What have we said,
Wasn't it their bed,
What of presence,
Haven't we paid penance,
To the new guns, to the new guns.
To you

// A.D.D. (American Dream Denial) //

We fought your wars with all our hearts,
You sent us back in body parts,
You took our wills with the truth you stole,
We offer prayers for your long lost soul.

The remainder is an unjustifiable, egotistical power struggle at the expense of the American Dream, of the American dream, of the American

We don't give a damn about your world
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls,
We don't give a damn about your world,
Right now, right now.
We don't give a fuck about your world,
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls,
We don't give a fuck about your world,
Right now, right now.
Right now, right now.

There is no flag that is large enough
To hide the shame of a man in cuffs,
You switched the signs then you closed their blinds,
You changed the channel then you changed their minds.

The remainder is an unjustifiable, egotistical power struggle at the expense of the American Dream, of the American dream, of the American

We don't give a damn about your world
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls,
We don't give a damn about your world,
Right now, right now.
We don't give a fuck about your world,
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls,
We don't give a fuck about your world,
Right now, right now.
Right now, right now.
Right now, right now.
Right now, right now.

No flag large enough,
Shame on a man in cuffs,
You closed their blinds.

The remainder is an unjustifiable, egotistical power struggle at the expense of the American Dream, of the American dream, of the American

We don't give a damn about your world,
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls,
We don't give a damn about your world,
Right now, right now.
We don't give a fuck about your world,
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls,
We don't give a fuck about your world,
Right now, right now,
Right now, right now,
Right now, right now,

// Mr. Jack //

Hey Mr. Jack,
Is that the mouthwash in your eyes,
Hey Mr. jack,
Is that the cause of your surprise,
Hey where you at,
On the side of the freeway in the car,
Hey where you at,
On the side of the freeway in the car.
In the car.

On the side of the freeway in the...
Hey Mr. Jack,
Is that the trick of your disguise,
Hey Mr. Jack,
Is that the cause of your demise,
Hey where you at,
On the side of the freeway in the car,
Hey where you at,
On the side of the freeway in the car,
In the car, in the car, in the car.

Seven a.m. morning, came to take us away,
Little men, big guns, pointed at our heads,
Seven a.m. morning, came to take us away,
Little men, big guns, pointed at our heads,
At our, at our heads.

Your prospect of living gone,
You ran the light at dawn,
Protectors on your back,
Lights are on their track.
You must now face authority,
You're nothing like me,
You must now face authority,
You're nothing like me.
Put you hands up, get out of the car,
Put you hands up, get out of the car,
Put you hands up, get out of the car.

Fuck you pig,
Fuck you pig,
Fuck you pig,
Fuck you pig,
Put you hands up, get out of the car.

// 36 //

Television in disgrace
Life you get old, it's the race,
Can you break out,
Can you break out,
Will you live at your own pace.

Life, so, unnecessary,

Television in disgrace
Life you get old, it's the race,
Can you break out,
Can you break out,
Will you live at your own pace.

Now will you live at your own pace?
Will you live at your own pace

// Pictures //

Flaunt your will at every wheel,
Parachute your chocolate soul,
Cobblestones under your wheels,
I got pictures on my mind,
I got pictures on my mind,
I got pictures on my mind,
I got pictures on my mind.

Circumvent your thick ego,
Wooden farts, they're on the go,
You can't tell me that I'm real,
I got pictures on my mind,
I got pictures on my mind,
I got pictures on my mind,
I got pictures on my mind.

Fear waits, for us,
When the present can't be sealed,
Away, gold dust,
Now the dishes can be cleared.
Fear waits, for us,
Till the moment is revealed,
Then turns to rust
For the mighty conquered meal.

Can't you lookat my shaved ass,
Ounce is gone, and God is once,
You can't see me suddenly,
I got pictures on my mind,
I got pictures on my mind,
I got pictures on my mind,
I got pictures on my mind.

I got pictures on my mind.

// Highway Song //

I need, I feel, a love,
You love to love the fear,
I never want to be alone,
I've forgotten to.

The road keeps moving clouds,
The clouds become unreal,
I guess I'll always be at home,
Do you want me to try,
Directing your night.

An exit lights the sky,
The sky becomes complete.
Traveling hearts divide the throne,
I've forgotten to.

Friction, lines, bumps,
The highway song complete,
The signs are all turning right,
Do you want me to try,
Directing your light,
Want me to try,
Directing your light.

The purest forms of life,
Our days are never coming back,
The cannons of our time,
Our days are never coming back,
The purest forms of life,
Our days are never coming back,
The cannons of our time,
Our days are never ever coming back.

Our days are never coming back,
Our days are never coming back,
Our days are never coming back.

// Ego Brain //

Life is but a dream, drifting on a stream, a stream
Consciously it seems
All of what remains... ego brain
Man made shame
Shame, love after it rains
You see my pain is real
Watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the fall
As I turn to sand
You took me by the hand
And declared, that love prevails over all
I am just a man
Fighting other men
For land, for land
While I turn to sand
In spite of the pain
Ego brain
Man made Shame
Shame, Love after it rains
You see my pain is real
Watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the fall
As I turn to sand
You took me by the hand
And declared that love prevails over all
All of what remains
Ego brain
Man made shame
Shame, Love after it rains
You see my pain is real
Watch my world dissolve
And pretend that none of us see the fall
As I turn to sand
You took me by the hand
And declared that love prevails over all

// Thetawaves //

The unsettled mind is at times an ally
Leaving the senses to fend for themselves
The senses collect undeniable data
Of beta-carotene and theta waves
The unsettled mind is at times an ally
Leaving the senses to fend for themselves
Then the senses wanted the sky

All rise, eyes bound
Time feels like a midnight ride
Finality waits outside
Weeping in perplexity's arms
Caressing our smiles inside

The national debt is at times an ally
Leaving the people to fend for themselves
The people collect undeniable data
About high pulse weapons and microwaves

The national debt is at times an ally
Leaving the people to fend for themselves
Then the people found out the lie

All rise, eyes bound
Now arise, heaven bound
Time feels like a midnight ride
Finality waits outside
Weeping in perplexity's arms
Caressing our smiles inside

Wanting to get you high
Wanting to touch the sky

All rise, eyes bound
Now arise, heaven bound
Time feels like a midnight ride
Finality waits outside
Weeping in perplexity's arms
Caressing our smiles inÃ¢ÂÂ

// Roulette //

I have a problem that I cannot explain,
I have no reason why it should have been so plain,
Have no questions but I sure have excuse,
I lack the reason why I should be so confused,

I know, how I feel when I'm around you,
I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you,
Around you,

Left a message but it ain't a bit of use,
I have some pictures, the wild might be the deuce,
Today you saw, you saw me, you explained,
Playing the show and running down the plane,

I know, how I feel when I'm around you,
I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you,
I, I know, how I feel when I'm around you,
I don't know, how I feel when I'm around you,
Around you, Around you, Around you...

// Streamline //

I wasn't there for you
I wasn't there for you
I know weather's gonna be fine
But I can't see you 'cross the streamline
My love waits for me in daytime
But I can't see you through the snowblind

But I wasn't there for you
You are gone (I wasn't there for you)
Goodbyes are long
Goodbye (I wasn't there for you)
Goodbye
I wasn't there for goodbye
I wasn't there for goodbye

Well, I know time reveals in hindsight
I can wrestle with the stormy night
Because your love lasts a lifetime
But I can see you through the snowblind

But I wasn't there for you
You are gone (I wasn't there for you)
Goodbyes are long
You are gone (I wasn't there for you)
Goodbyes are long
Goodbye

I wasn't there for you
I wasn't there
I wasn't there for you
I wasn't there for you
You are gone (I wasn't there for you)
Goodbyes are long
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
