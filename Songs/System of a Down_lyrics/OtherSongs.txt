I, wishing and wishing away as you go

I, wishing and wishing away as you go


I don't see nothing but pain and misery

Cause you are the one for me

Why can't it all be true

Can I escape with my blue fallen reverie

Why can't it all be true

Why can't it all be true


I, wishing and wishing away as you go

I, wishing and wishing away as you go


Suddenly I believe

Your were the one for me

Graciously you go through

My closed heart's artery

Can I escape with my blue fallen reverie

Why can't it all be true

Why can't it all be true


I've been wishing away as you

I've been wishing away as you

I've been wishing away as you go


I don't see nothing but pain and misery

Cause you are the one for me

Why can't it all be true

Can I escape with my blue fallen reverie

Why can't it all be true

Why can't it all be true


Wishing and wishing away as you go

Wishing and wishing away as you go

Wishing and wishing away as you go

Wishing and wishing away as you go

Wishing and wishing away as you go

Wishing and wishing away as you go

As you go

As you go

As you go

// Cherry (Virginity) //

I don't know why she called
But it was her strange way
Of tellin' me about her
Fuck!

She told me she was the one and then everything was done
And then I looked around, what did I see?
She told me she was the one and then everything was done
And then I looked around and, what did I see?

Well, I fucked her
Right underneath the tree
And I can't believe I took her virginity
Virginity, virginity

And then I just woke up, what a strange nightmare
My eyes couldn't focus, was it her?
Was it a friend or foe? I didn't really know
But as I turned around, what did I see?

Well, I fucked her
Right underneath the tree
And I can't believe I took her virginity
Virginity, virginity

Virgin tea, virgin tea
Virgin tea, virgin tea
Won't you buy some virgin tea?
Won't you buy some virgin tea?
Won't you buy some virgin tea?
Won't you buy some virgin tea?

Well, I fucked her
Right underneath the tree
And I can't believe I took her virginity
Virginity, virginity

And then I just woke up
What a strange nightmare
My eyes couldn't focus
Was it her?

// Dam //

Dam you

Stay away from me

I got a disease

Everyone is sleeping


Fuck you

For putting hate in me

For putting faith in me

Everyone is sleeping


Everyone is sleeping

Everyone is sleeping

Everyone is sleeping

// Defy You //

Let me desecrate your child
Let me penetrate your world
Let me penetrate your mind
Let me desecrate you

Don't let me desecrate you, my child
Don't let me penetrate your world
And steal the warmness of your soul away
Don't let me desecrate you, my child
Don't let me penetrate your world
And steal the warmness of your soul away

I divide you with faith
Provide you your soul
Defy you to love
I divide you with your faith
I provide you with your soul
I defy you into love

Don't let me desecrate you, my child
Don't let me penetrate your world
And steal the warmness of your soul away
Don't let me desecrate you, my child
Don't let me penetrate your world
And steal the warmness of your soul away

I divide you with faith
Provide you your soul
Defy you to love
I divide you with your faith
I provide you with your soul
I defy you into love

Little boy stared into the eyes of the night
Button collects price of his time
Little girl bled, sheets of the night
Bullet connects to the price of its crime

I divide you with faith
Provide you your soul
Defy you to love
I divide you with your faith
I provide you with your soul
I defy you into love
I divide you with faith
Provide you your soul
Defy you to love
I divide you with your faith
I provide you with your soul
I defy you into love

// Forever (Outer Space) //

Edmund Kemper solved it all
He fooled the shrinks
Fooled the shrinks
It then appears the proclamation
He fooled the shrinks
Fooled the shrinks

Edmund Kemper solved it all
He fooled the shrinks
Fooled the shrinks
It then appears the proclamation
He fooled the shrinks

The fortress of forever
Been forsaken
Man made promise
Polluted with blue dye
Air, water, design
Man made promise
Polluted with blue dye

Can we tamper
We have gained
Outer space, outer space
A million years
The devistation of
Outer space, outer space

Can we tamper
We have gained
Outer space, outer space
That's not true
that's not true
the human race, the human race

The fortress of forever
Been forsaken
Man made promise
Polluted with blue dye
Air, water, design
Man made promise
Polluted with blue dye

Fortress of forever
Been mistaken
Man made promise
Polluting of the sky [x2]

The fortress of forever
Been forsaken
Man made promise
Polluted with blue dye
Air, water, design
Man made promise
Polluted with blue dye

// Friik //

What's my problem
Here's my problem
My problem is I'm
Too visual to be blind
Too audiological to deaf
Too ideological to be in peace
Too compassionate to be in war
Too crazy to be sane
Too sane to be lazy
Too emotional to be you

If I could only stop my head from going into constant infection
Then maybe I could swim back to my own version of consistent sanity
Angelic demons, liquid dreams, transparent mountains of our own reality

Burning oceans
Melting faces 
Melting faces
Why?

If I could only stop my head from going into constant infection
Then maybe I could swim back to my own version of consistent sanity
Angelic demons, liquid dreams, transparent mountains of our own reality

Burning oceans
Melting faces
Melting Faces
Why?
Lying glaciers 
Swimming meadows
Mind control

Amnesia!
Hysteria!
Insomnia!
Can't sleep, can't eat, can't shit
Cause you're in the hospital and they're fucking
Why?

Burning oceans
Melting faces
Melting faces
Why?
Lying glaciers
Swimming meadows
Mind control
Maybe my mind's not a t all in control
Maybe I'm not in control

// Patterns //

Life is a story,

Go ahead and find your sight.


Life is your glory,

Go ahead and live the night.


But to live means to be here,

In the present, now,

Do you try to bow for the gift of your day,

Then you cede to the morning sun.


Pretending that we live doesn't make us alive.


Life is a story,

Go ahead and find your sight.


But to live means to be here,

In the present, now,

Do you try to bow for the gift of your day,

Then you cede to the morning sun.


Pretending that we see doesn't give us the sight

Pretending that we live doesn't make us alive.


What is it that makes us lose sight,

True sight, of what is real and essential?

I'll take organised patterns of chaos

Over the chaotic organisations of man, any day.


Pretending that we see doesn't give us the sight

Pretending that we live doesn't make us alive.


Pretending that we see doesn't give us the sight

Pretending that we live doesn't make us alive.


The patterns in the carpet do add up though,

You don't have to count.


The patterns in the carpet do add up though,

You don't have to count.

// Protect The Land //

The big gun tells you what your life is worth
What do we deserve before we end the earth?
If they will try to push you far away
Would you stay and take a stand?
Would you stay with gun in hand?
They protect the land
They protect the land

Those who protect the land
Those who protect the land
Those who protect

The enemy of man is his own decay
If they're evil now then evil they will stay
If they will try to push you far away
Would you stay and take a stand?
Would you stay with gun in hand?
They protect the land
They protect the land
They protect the land

Our history and victory and legacy we send
From scavengers and invaders those who protect the land
Those who protect the land
Those who protect
Those who protect the land
Those who protect

Some were forced to foreign lands
Some would lay dead on the sand
Would you stay and take command?
Would you stay with gun in hand?
(With gun in hand)
They protect the land
They protect the land
They protect the land

Our history and victory and legacy we send
From scavengers and invaders those who protect the land
Our history and victory and legacy we send
From scavengers and invaders those who protect
Those who protect the land
Those who protect the land
Those who protect
Those who protect the land
Those who protect

// Shame //

I FUCK yo' ass up! (fuck'em up son)

[Chorus:]

Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga

Wu buck wild with the trigger!

Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga    

Yo, I FUCK yo' ass up!


(HUT ONE, HUT TWO, HUT THREE, HUT!)


S.O.A.D., live and uncut!

Styles unbreakable, shatterproof

To the young youth, ya wanna get gun? Shoot!

BLAOW! How you like me now? Don't fuck the style

Ruthless wild!

Do ya wanna getcha teeth knocked the FUCK out?

Wanna get on it like that, well then shout!


Lasers and blazers

Hit me with the major

The damage, my Clan understand it be flavor

Gunnin, hummin comin atcha

First I'm gonna getcha, once I gotcha, I gat-cha

You could never capture the Method Man's stature

For rhyme and for rapture, got niggaz resigning, now master

my style? Never! I put the fucking buck in the wild kid

Let's get together


(Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga

Wu buckwild with the tri-BLAOW!)


Brought like 20 white boys

in the back of a pick-up truck

with hockey pucks and skateboards

on their way to Woodstock

Leave home the glock

I have a gun the size of a blackhole

Shoot planets

Don't get credit

Throw your hands up in the air

Don't panic

Supreme arm leg leg arm head

Wu-Tang-Clan playin' the tightest long dreads.

[Chorus:]


(Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga

Wu buck wild with the trigger!

Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga

I'll FUCK YOUR ASS UP!)


I come with that ol' loco

Style from my vocal

Couldn't peep it with a pair of bi-focals

I'm no joker! Play me as a joker

Be on you like a house on fire! Smoke ya!

Crews be actin like they gangs, anyway

Be like, "Warriors! Come out and playiyay!"

Burn me, I get into shit, I let it out like diarrhea

Got burnt once, but that was only gonorrhea

Dirty, I keep shit stinks in my drawers

So I can get fzza-funky for yah

Murder, taste the flame of the Wu-Tang RAHH!

Here comes the Tiger verse Crane!

Ow, be like wild with my style

Punk! You playing me, chump, you get DUMPED

WU! Is comin THROUGH! At a theatre near YOU!

And get funk like a SHOE!

// Snowblind //

[Originally sung by Black Sabbath]


What you get and what you see

Things that don't come easily

Feeling happy in my vein

Icicles within my brain


(cocain)


Something blowing in my head

Winter's ice, it soon will spread

Death would freeze my very soul

Makes me happy, makes me cold


(cocain)


My eyes are blind but I can see

The snowflakes glisten on the tree

The sun no longer sets me free

I feel there's no place freezing me


Let the winter sun shine on

Let me feel the frost of dawn

Fill my dreams with flakes of snow

Soon I'll feel the chilling glow


Don't you think I know what I'm doing

Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong

You're the one who's really a loser

This is where I feel I belong


Crystal world with winter flowers

Turns my day to frozen hours

Lying snowblind in the sun

Will my ice age ever come?

// Starlit Eyes //

Pushin' the law again

Pushin' the law again


Justice with a sword

Our smiling knight on board

Opening his heart to everyone

And loving without a doubt

Embracing friends and

Embarrassing foes,

And those who were unjust

A man true to his heart

Without fear or misgivings

With "insecurity" tattooed

Across his body

The first to accept, the last to disappoint

He understood all and expected nothing


Now you are free

Free to roam in the skies

Now and then visit me

With your starlit eyes

You took all our hearts

With your smile,

And left a legacy untold

You conquered life and fear,

So you see there was no room for you to grow old

// Temper //

We want peace without 

Patriot missiles, 

Blown to bits are civilian targets, 

Parade! Laugh! Rejoice! Sing! 

We are the victors of...nothing, 

Spend more money on a war, 

Your people starving, turned to whores, 

Slaves of the chosen one paying millions for each bomb, 


Country without a race , 

Formed from people you disgrace , 

White right conservative might , 

Killers of Kennedy's with no fright , 

The American way! 


Freedom cried the marching man, 

Flags ripped out of their black hands , 

Beaten! Slain! Tortured! Killed! 

Their only mistake was being born here , 

Invade countries just for oil , 

Send your troops all down to boil , 

Iraq! Grenada! Nam and Chile! 

Truman doctrine our own way , 


Country without a race , 

Formed from people you disgrace , 

White right conservative might , 

Killers of Kennedy's with no fright , 

The American way! 


The Government here can suck my balls , 

Policing the world in overalls , 

Armed rebellion minority , 

Disrespected race, colored mind , 

Crazed loonies all walk the streets , 

Missing children on milk cartons , 

Mother selling child for crack , 

Mr. President check your back , 


Country without a race , 

Formed from people you disgrace, 

White right conservative might , 

Killers of Kennedy's with no fright , 

The American way! 

The American way! 

The American way!

// The Metro //

I'm alone

Sitting with my broken glass

My four walls

Follow me through my past 

I was on a Paris train 

I emerged in London rain 

And you were waiting there

Swimming through apologies


I remember searching for the perfect words 

I was hoping you might change your mind 

I remember a soldier standing next to me 

Riding on The Metro 


I was smiling as you took my hand

Saw the moon

We spoke in France

You were passed the shallow words 

Years have passed and still the hurt 

You were passed the shallow words

Years have passed and still the hurt 

I can see you now 

Smiling as I pulled away

Sorry


I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand 

"I'll love you always" filled my eyes 

I remember the night we walked along the Seine

Riding on The Metro


I remember a feeling coming over me 

Then the soldier turned and walked away

Fuck you for loving me 

Riding on The Metro 


ahhh
