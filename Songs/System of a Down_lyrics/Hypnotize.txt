Album: Hypnotize

// Attack //

Breathing each other's lives
Holding this in mind
That if we fall, we all fall
And we fall alone

The cold insincerity of steel machines
Have consumed our euphoria
Transforming us into muted dreams
Dreaming of the day that

We attack
Attack, attack your fetal servitude
We attack
Attack, attack, attack with pesticide
We attack
All the years of propaganda
We shall attack!

Books illustrate what we already know
Candles cry towards the sky
Racing your flags along polluted coast
Dreaming of the day that

We attack
Attack, attack your fetal servitude
We attack
Attack, attack, attack with pesticide
We attack
All the years of propaganda
We shall attack!

Attack! (Attack!)

Breathing each other's lives
Holding this in mind
That if we fall, we all fall
And we fall alone

Breathing each other's lives
Holding this in mind
That if we fall, we all fall
And we fall alone

Was the philosophy of displaced mines
The bombing of all homes and villages?
Truth is the only sword bleeding minds
Bleeding till the day that

We attack
Attack, attack your fetal servitude
We attack
Attack, attack, attack with pesticide
We attack
All the years of propaganda
We shall attack!

Attack all the homes and villages
Attack all the schools and hospitals
You attack all the rapes and pillages
We shall attack!

We shall attack!

// Dreaming //

For today we will take the body parts and put them on the wall

For treated indigenously, digenously
Human right is private blue chip, pry

For treated indigenously, digenously (We're the prophetic generation of bottled water, bottled water)
Human right is private blue chip, pry (Causing poor populations to die, to die, to die)

You, you went beyond
And you lost it all
Why did you go there?
From beyond
You saw it all
Why did you?

For treated indigenously, digenously (We lost consumer confidence in casual karma, casual karma)
Human right is private blue chip, pry (Confetti, camouflage, camouflage, the flage, the flage)

You, you went beyond
And you lost it all
Why did you go there?
From beyond
You saw it all
Why did you go there?

She lost her mind
Someone kicked her into the back of the line
She lost her head
When they called and said that they thought he was dead

Dreaming of screaming
Someone kick me out of my mind
I hate these thoughts I can't deny

// Hypnotize //

Why don't you ask the kids at Tienanmen square?
Was fashion the reason why they were there?

They disguise it, hypnotize it
Television made you buy it

I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my

She's scared that I will take her away from there
Dreams that her country left with no one there

Mesmerize the simple minded
Propaganda leaves us blinded

I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl
I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl

I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl
I'm just sitting in my car and waiting for my girl

Two skies watching it all fading
Two skies living it all fading
Two skies watching it all fading
Two skies fading ones abating
Two suns living it all dying
Two suns fighting ones abiding

Two suns watching them both fighting
Two suns seeing them both dying
Two suns watching them both fighting
Two suns fighting ones abiding
Two skies seeing them both dying
Two skies fading ones abiding

Oh oh ah

Crack pipes, needles, PCP and fast cars
Kind of mix really well and a dead movie star
When I feel like talking I'll never be wrong
If I fell like walking you best come along
I close my windows crank the heat up high
till my palms are wet and my tongue is dry

I'm looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker if I die I die
I'm a midnight fist fight

Looking for a mother that will get me high

Looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker if I die I die...

// Tentative //

Superstition taking all of us for a ride
Mimes overtaken by the signs of the Right
The bombs are falling overhead with no sight
While you are talking all detached, so tell us

Where you're going to the bottom
Do you hear us we are rotting?
We're going down in a spiral to the ground
No one, no one's gonna save us now!

Ceremonies have killed religions for they provide
The masked comforts to delusionals, they're all in fright
The true believer's head was bathed in sunlight
While you are walking all detached, so tell us

Where you're going to the bottom
Do you hear us we are rotting?
We're going down in a spiral to the ground
No one, no one's gonna save us now, not even god!
No one saved us, no one's gonna save us

Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?
Where do you expect them to go when the bombs fall?
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?

Superstition taking all of us for a ride
Mimes overtaken by the signs of the Right
The bombs are falling over our head with no sight
While you are talking all detached, detached, detached, detached, detached,
We're going down in a spiral to the ground
No one, no one's gonna save us now! (not even god!)
No one saved us, no one saved us
No one saved us, no one's gonna save us now
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?

// Lonely Day //

Such a lonely day
And it's mine
The most loneliest day of my life

Such a lonely day
Should be banned
It's a day that I can't stand

The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life

Such a lonely day
Shouldn't exist
It's a day that I'll never miss
Such a lonely day
And it's mine
The most loneliest day of my life

And if you go, I wanna go with you
And if you die, I wanna die with you

Take your hand and walk away

The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life
Life

Such a lonely day
And it's mine
It's a day that I'm glad I survived

// Soldier Side //

Dead men lying on the bottom of the grave
Wondering when Savior comes, is he gonna be saved
Maybe you're a sinner into your alternate life
Maybe you're a joker, maybe you deserve to die

They were crying when their sons left
God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope
He's never coming back

They were crying when their sons left
All young men must go
He's come so far to find the truth
He's never going home

Young men standing on the top of their own graves
Wondering when Jesus comes, are they gonna be saved
Cruelty to the winner, bishop tells the King his lies
Maybe you're a mourner, maybe you deserve to die

They were crying when their sons left
God is wearing black
He's gone so far to find no hope
He's never coming back

They were crying when their sons left
All young men must go
He's come so far to find no truth
He's never going home

Welcome to the Soldier Side
Where there is no one here but me
People all grow up to die
There is no one here but me

Welcome to the Soldier Side
There is no one here but me
People on the soldier's side
There is no one here but me
