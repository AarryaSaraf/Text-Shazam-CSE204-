// Prison Song //

They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison

Following the rights movement
You clamped on with your iron fists
Drugs became conveniently
Available for all the kids

Following the rights movement
You clamped on with your iron fists
Drugs became conveniently
Available for all the kids

I buy my crack, my smack, my bitch right here in Hollywood
(nearly 2 million Americans are incarcerated in the prison system, prison system of the US)
(They're trying to build a prison)

They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
(for you and me to live in)
Another prison system
Another prison system
Another prison system
(for you and me)

Minor drug offenders fill your prisons you don't even flinch
All our taxes paying for your wars against the new non-rich
Minor drug offenders fill your prisons you don't even flinch
All our taxes paying for your wars against the new non-rich

I buy my crack, my smack, my bitch right here in Hollywood
(the percentage of Americans in the prison system, prison system, has doubled since 1985)
(They're trying to build a prison)

They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
(for you and me to live in)
Another prison system
Another prison system
Another prison system
For you and I, for you and I, for you and I.

They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison for you and me

Oh, baby, you and me.

All research and successful drug policy show that treatment should be increased
And law enforcement decreased while abolishing mandatory minimum sentences
All research and successful drug policy show that treatment should be increased
And law enforcement decreased while abolishing mandatory minimum sentences

Utilising drugs to pay for secret wars around the world
Drugs are now your global policy, now you police the globe

I buy my crack, my smack, my bitch right here in Hollywood
Drug money is used to rig elections and train brutal corporate sponsored dictators around the world
(They're trying to build a prison)

They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
(for you and me to live in)
Another prison system
Another prison system
Another prison system
(for you and me)

For you and I, for you and I, for you and I, for you and I

They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison for you and me

Oh, baby, you and me

// Needles //

I cannot disguise
All the stomach pains
And the walking of the canes
When you do come out
And you whisper up to me
In your life of tragedy

But I cannot grow
'Til you eat the last of me
Oh when will I be free
And you, a parasite
Just find another host
Just another fool to roast

Cause you
My tapeworm tells me what to do
You
My tapeworm tells me where to go

Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey

I cannot deny
All the evil traits
And the filling of the crates
When you you do come out out
And you slither up to me
In your pimping majesty

But I cannot grow
'Til you eat the last of me
Oh when will I be free
And you you, a parasite parasite
Just find another host
Just another stool to post

Cause you
My tapeworm tells me what to do
You
My tapeworm tells me where to go

Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of me

I'm sitting in my room
With a needle in my hand
Just waiting for the tomb
Of some old dying man

Sitting in my room
With a needle in my hand
Just waiting for the tomb
Of some old dying man

Cause you
My tapeworm tells me what to do
You
My tapeworm tells me where to go

Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass, hey

Hey, hey, hey, hey

// Deer Dance //

Circumventing circuses
Lamenting in protest
Invisible police
Presence-sponsored fear
Battalions of riot police
With rubber bullet kisses
Baton courtesy
Service with a smile

Beyond the staples center you can see America
With its tired poor avenging disgrace
Peaceful loving youth against the brutality
Of plastic existence

Pushing little children
With their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around

Pushing little children
With their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around

A rush of words
Pleading to disperse
Upon your naked walls, alive
A political call
The fall guy accord
We can't afford to be neutral on a moving train

Beyond the staples center you can see America
With its tired poor avenging disgrace
Peaceful loving youth against the brutality
Of plastic existence

Pushing little children
With their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around

Pushing little children
With their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around

Push them around

A deer dance, invitation to peace
War staring you in the face, dressed in black

With a helmet, fierce
Trained and appropriate for the malcontents
For the disproportioned malcontents.

A little boy smiled, it'll all be well
And I say a little boy smiled, it'll all be well

Pushing little children
With their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around

Pushing little children
With their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around

Pushing little children
With their fully automatics
They like to push the weak around

Push the weak around
Push the weak around
Push the weak around
They like to push the weak around.

// Jet Pilot //

Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay

My horse is a shackled old man
His, his remorse, was that he couldn't survey
The skies, right before
Right before they went gray
My horse and my remorse
Flying over a great bay

Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay

My source is the source of all creation
Her discourse is that we all don't survey
The skies, right before
Right before they go gray
My source and my remorse
Flying over a great bay

Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay

Where were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Where were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay

Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay

Where were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay
Where were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot
One that smiled when he flew over the bay

// Chop Suey! //

We're rolling suicide

Wake up (wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little make-up
Hide the scars to fade away the shake-up (hide the scars to fade away the...)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go create another fable

You wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
You wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shake-up
You wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
You wanted to

I don't think you trust
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to
Die

Wake up (wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little make-up

I don't think you trust

I cry when angels deserve to die
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die

Father, father, father, father
Father, into your hands I commend my spirit
Father, into your hands
Why have you forsaken me?
In your eyes forsaken me
In your thoughts forsaken me
In your heart forsaken me, oh

Trust in my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die

// Bounce //

Jump, Bounce, Down, Up

I went out on a date,
With a girl, a bit late,
She had so many friends,
Gliding through many hands.
I brought my pogo stick,
Just to show her a trick,
She had so many friends,
Gliding through many hands.

Jump Pogo?..
Bounce Pogo,
Down Pogo, Up Pogo

Unannounced twister games,
All players with no names,
They lined up double quick,
But just one pogo stick,
Everyone gets to play,
Runaway, expose',
It was so exotic,
But just one pogo stick.

Jump Pogo?..
Bounce Pogo,
Down Pogo, Up Pogo

Oh, I like to spread you out,
Touching whoever's behind

Jump Pogo?..
Bounce Pogo,
Down Pogo, Up Pogo

// Forest //

Walk with me my little child
To the forest of denial
Speak with me my only mind
Walk with me until the time
And make the forest turn to wine
You take the legend for a fall
You saw the product

Why can't you see that you are my child
Why don't you know that you are my mind
Tell everyone in the world that I'm you
Take this promise to the end of you

Walk with me my little friend
Take this promise through the end
Speak with me my only mind
Walk with me until the end
And make the forest turn to sand
You take the legend for a fall
You saw the product

Why can't you see that you are my child
Why don't you know that you are my mind
Tell everyone in the world that I'm you
Take this promise to the end of you

Take this promise for a ride
You saw the forest, now come inside
You took the legend for its fall
You saw the product of it all
No televisions in the air
No circumcisions on the chair
You made the weapons for us all
Just look at us now

Why can't you see that you are my child
Why don't you know that you are my mind
Tell everyone in the world that I'm you
Take this promise to the end of you

Making two possibilities a reality
Predicting the future of things we all know
Fighting off the diseased programming
Of centuries, centuries, centuries, centuries

Science fails to recognize the single most
Potent element of human existence
Letting the reigns go to the unfolding
Is faith, faith, faith, faith

Science has failed our world
Science has failed our Mother Earth

// Toxicity //

Conversion, software version 7.0
Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub

Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

New, what do you own the world?
How do you own disorder, disorder
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

More wood for their fires, loud neighbours
Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck

Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

New, what do you own the world?
How do you own disorder, disorder
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

New, what do you own the world?
How do you own disorder
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

When I became the sun
I shone life into the man's hearts
When I became the sun
I shone life into the man's hearts

// Aerials //

Life is a waterfall
We're one in the river
And one again after the fall

Swimming through the void
We hear the word
We lose ourselves but we find it all

'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Always wanna go
But you never wanna stay

And we are the ones that wanna choose
Always wanna play
But you never wanna lose

Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind
You free your life

Life is a waterfall
We drink from the river
Then we turn around and put up our walls

Swimming through the void
We hear the word
We lose ourselves but we find it all

'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Always wanna go
But you never wanna stay

We are the ones that wanna choose
Always wanna play
But you never wanna lose

Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind
You free your life

Aerials so up high
When you free your eyes eternal prize

Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind
You free your life

Aerials so up high
When you free your eyes eternal prize
