// Suite-Pee //

I had an out of body experience
The other day
Her name was Jesus
And for her everyone cried
Everyone cried
Everyone cried

Try her philosophy
Try her philosophy
Try her philosophy
Try
You die for her philosophy
Die for her philosophy
Die her philosophy
Die

Crossed and terrored ravages of architecture
Lend me thy blades
We're crossed and terrored ravages of architecture
Hoist around the spade

Try her philosophy
Try her philosophy
Try her philosophy
Try
You die for her philosophy
Die for her philosophy
Die her philosophy
Die

Die...
Die...
Die...
Why...

Lie naked on the floor and let the messiah go through our souls
Lie naked on the floor and let the messiah go all through our souls

Die
Like a mother fucker
Die
Like a mother fucker
Why
Like a mother fucker, like a mother fucker

I want to fuck my way to the garden
Cause everyone needs a mother, fucker!

The following of a Christ
The following of a Christ
The following of a Christ
The falling of Christ
The falling of Christ
The falling of Christ
The falling of Christ

// Know //

Cursed Earth, cursed Earth, cursed Earth, cursed Earth

I'll never feed off the evergreen luster of your heart
All because we all live in the valley of the walls
When they speak, we can peek from the windows of their mouths
To see the land, the women chant as they fly up to the sun

You never think you know why, know
You never think you know why, know
Ever think you know why, know

Books all say different things, while people flap their yellow wings
Trying to soar by being a whore of life and almost everything
The sheep that ran off from the herd may be dead
But now's a bird able to fly, able to die, able to fuck your brother's earth

You never think you know why, know
You never think you know why, know
Ever think you know why, know

On the other side, on the other side, the other side
Do you ever try to fly, do you ever try to fly?
Have you ever wanted to die, have you ever wanted to die?

Don't ever try to fly, don't ever try to fly
Don't ever try to fly, unless you leave your body on the other side
Never try to die, you ever try to die

You never think you know why, know
You never think you know why, know
You never think you know why, know
Ever think you know why, know

// Sugar //

The kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who can believe you?
Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray

Sugar!
Sugar!

I'm not there all the time, you know
Some people, some people, some people
Call it insane!
Yeah, they call it insane! (Sugar!)

I play Russian Roulette every day, a man's sport
With the bullet called life
Yeah mama, called life! (Sugar!)
You know that every time I try to go
Where I really want to be
It's already where I am
'Cause I'm already there!

The kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who can believe you?
Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray

Sugar!

I got a gun the other day from Sako
It's cute, small, fits right in my pocket
Yeah, right in my pocket! (Sugar!)
My girl, you know, she lashes out at me sometimes
And I just fucking kick her in the
Ooh baby, she's OK (Sugar!)
People are always chasing me down
Trying to push my face to the ground
Where all they really want to do
Is suck out my motherfucking brains!

Sugar!

The kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who can believe you?
Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray!

I sit... in my desolate room...
No lights!
No music!
Just anger!
I killed everyone
I'm gone away forever
But I'm feeling better!
How do I feel, what do I say
Fuck you, it all goes away
How do I feel, what do I say
Fuck you, it all goes away

How do I feel, what do I say
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel, what do I say
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel, what do I say
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel, what do I say
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel, what do I say
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel, what do I say

In the end it all goes away
In the end it all goes away
In the end it all goes away
In the end it all goes away
In the end it all goes away

// Suggestions //

Watching from a post up high
From where you see the ships afar
From a well-trained eye
The waves all keep on crashing by
If you are the light post
Then you own the working class
But if you want the answers
You better give a piece of ass
Give a piece of your ass

Warning, post hypnotic suggestions
Running the ships ashore
The orange light that follows
Will soon proclaim itself a god
If you point your questions
The fog will surely chew you up
But if you want the answers
You better get ready for the fire
Get ready for the fire

The ships are multiplying day after day, sir
And they're coming close to the shore, sir, shore, sir
We need to evacuate the light post
It's all over, it's all over
It's all over

// Spiders //

The piercing radiant moon (The piercing radiant moon)
The storming of poor June (Storming of poor June)
All the life running through her hair (Through her hair)

Approaching guiding light (Approaching guiding light)
Our shallow years in fright (Our shallow years in fright)
Dreams are made, winding (Dreams are made, winding)
Through my head (Through my head)
Through my head

Before you know, awake

Your lives are open wide
The V-chip gives them sight
Of all the life running through her hair

The spiders all in tune
The evening of the moon
Dreams are made, winding
Through my head
Through my head

Before you know, awake

Through my head
Through my head
Before you know

Before you know I will be waiting, all awake

Dreams are made winding through her hair
Dreams are made winding through her hair

// DDevil //

Plagiarized existence exist
Among the writers of the word
Shake your spear at Shakespeare
Shake your spear at Shakespeare

Loud and noisy
Strong refrigerators
Gaining independence
Gaining independence

Stupid people do stupid things
Smart people outsmart each other
Then themselves, then themselves
Then themselves, then themselves

Take me down there
Photographic relapse
People feeding frenzy
The devil is so lovely
The devil is so lovely
The devil is so lovely
So lovely
So lovely

My blue moon rivets in exits
Forewarned customary spirits
By myself, by myself
By myself, by myself

Take me down there
Photographic relapse
People feeding frenzy
The devil is so lovely

Take me down there
Photographic relapse
People feeding frenzy
The devil is so lovely

// Soil //

The phoenix he helped create
Out of control, boy without a dad
Shot the gun that startled my life
While I drove him with a forty-five

Friends for years, images in red
Blew off his own motherfucking head
Confidence, death, insecurity
Men fall unrealized
Unrealized, unrealized

Making a decision of death
While everyone around you plead
Now you fly in peace
I hope, my friend
A man can't avoid what he's meant to do
When he's meant to do it
Even if he doesn't really want to

My memories are of fun and friendship
Of weakness within the strength of youth
For reasons undefined, reasons undefined
Reasons undefined, reasons undefined

Friends for years, images in red
Blew off his own motherfucking head
Confidence, death, insecurity
Your men fall unrealized

Don't you realize evil lives in the motherfucking skin?
Don't you realize that evil lives in the motherfucking skin?
Don't you realize that evil lives in the motherfucking skin?
Don't you realize that evil lives in the skin?

Don't you realize evil lives in the motherfucking skin?
Don't you realize that evil lives in the motherfucking skin?

Why the fuck did you take him away from us, you motherfucker, —fucker, —fucker, —fucker?!

// War? //

Dark is the light
The man you fight
With all your prayers, incantations
Running away, a trivial day
Of judgment and deliverance
To whom was sold, this bounty soul
A gentile or a priest?
Who victored over, the Seljuks
When the Holy Land was taken

We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

Was it the riches of the land
Powers of bright darkness
That lead the noble to the East
To fight the heathens

We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

We must call upon our bright darkness
Beliefs, they're the bullets of the wicked
One was written on the sword
For you must enter a room to destroy it, destroy it, destroy it!

Now international security
The call of the righteous man
Needs a reason to kill man
History teaches us so
The reason he must attain
Must be approved by his God
His child, partisan brother of war

Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore
Of war, we don't speak anymore

We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens
We will fight the heathens, we will fight the heathens

// Mind //

Oh baby come close to me,
Let me love you.
Oh baby come close to me,
Let me feel you.

Look at each other [8x]

Go away, go away, go away, go away.

Well, now, mutually mentally molested children of a mother.
Mutually mentally molested children of sin.

Bow down
The ever so popular beating that took you under,
Bow down
The ever so popular beating that broke your skin.

Free thinkers are dangerous,
Blame, hate, for fate's sake.

Go away, go away, go away, go away.

Now you need the ones you love and love the ones that you need.
Need the ones you love and love the ones you bleed.

Lives rearranged and lives in my range can you see.
Lives rearranged and lives in my range can you see.

Free thinkers are dangerous,
Blame, hate, for fate's sake.

Die, die, die, die
Gonna let you mother fuckers die [3x]

Look at each other [3x]

// Peephole //

When your stars are baked
And your rivers fly
Do you ever believe you were stuck out in the sky

When your castle breaks
And your feet are dry
Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky

Do you believe, when you're high
That your life is tried

Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't ever get stuck in the sky, when you're high

When your moon is fake
And your mermaids cry
Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky

When your tunnel fades
And your guide is shy
Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky

Do you believe, when you're high
That your life is tried

Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't ever get stuck in the sky, when you're high
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't ever get stuck in the sky, when you're high

Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky
Don't ever get stuck in the sky, when you're high

Preflight delight
Defaced street lights
A pyramid mind fuck
Don't leave your seats now

Popcorn everywhere, canned
Cliche people, organs rare
Corn everywhere, canned
Cliche people, organs rare

Rare...

I want to be
A fallen ruby
Guest vibrations
Don't leave your seats now

Humans everywhere, canned
Cliche people, organs rare
Humans everywhere, canned
Cliche people, cannot dare

Dare...

Humans everywhere, canned
Cliche people, organs rare
Humans everywhere, canned
Cliche people, cannot dare

Humans everywhere, canned
Cliche people, cannot dare, dare, dare, dare

May I please remain in this space

Arise as did the gods Ninti
Arise as did the gods Ninti
Arise as did the gods Ninti and Ishkur

Clock men, for they will fail
Fear not the gods that come from the sky
Long not for the one who've lost their way
Long not for the one who've lost their way

Arise as did the gods Ninti
Arise as did the gods Ninti
Arise as did the gods Ninti and Ishkur, Ishkur motherfucker!

Can you tell me?
I don't know

Elimination...

Die!
Why?

Walk down!
Walk down!

A whole race genocide
Taken away all of our pride
A whole race genocide
Taken away

Watch them all fall down!

Revolution, the only solution
The armed response of an entire nation
Revolution, the only solution
We've taken all your shit
Now it's time for restitution

Recognition, restoration, reparation
Recognition, restoration, reparation
Watch them all fall down!

Revolution, the only solution
The armed response of an entire nation
Revolution, the only solution
We've taken all your shit
Now it's time for restitution!

The plan was mastered and called genocide (never want to see you around)
Took all the children and then we died (never want to see you around)
The few that remained were never found (never want to see you around)
All in a system!

Down!
Down!
Down!
Down!

Walk down!
Walk down!

Watch them all fall down!

Revolution, the only solution
The armed response of an entire nation
Revolution, the only solution
We've taken all your shit
Now it's time for restitution!

The plan was mastered and called genocide (never want to see you around)
Took all the children and then we died (never want to see you around)
The few that remained were never found (never want to see you around)
All in a system, down...

// Marmalade //

Stretching, filing against her skin
Blessed are those who are not kin
In sin we breathe, in sex we tie
Duct tape her legs to the red sky

Foolsome flesh allowances
The pansies raided the pantry of
Gathering dreams, promiscuous
Delight, deny not the flavor

Custard dreams
Abusing, using
Marmalade flesh
Naked spread am I, am I

Actors of the tragic phantom
Extend your legs for great Saturn
Brown table tops scream for cover
At the sight of your new lover

If today I die and can't deny
The poison chosen for tonight
Tonight

Borrowed dreams, hollowed reveries
Metal pillows, pewter yellows
Furry roadkill, house on the hill
Pouring gravy on her thighs still

If today I die and can't deny
The poison chosen for tonight
Tonight

The spine, a line, the fetus is mine
Don't forget me
Don't forget me
Don't forget me
Don't forget revolt
Revolt
Revolution, counterrevolution
Counter counterrevolution
The mind
Mind the mind that feeds the blind
And helps you find
And makes you bind
The game
Is on
The game is on, the game is on
The game is on, the game is on

The spine, a line the fetus is mine
The spine, a line the fetus is mine
The spine, a line the fetus is mine
The spine, a line the fetus is mine

A life, denied
Comatosis, comatosis, comatosis
Comment on my word, define
My words define, my words define
My words define, my words define
The line, the line
Revolution, counterrevolution
Counter counterrevolution
Solution
Disillusioned by pollution
Resolution starting with the

Spine, a line the fetus is mine
The spine, a line the fetus is mine...
