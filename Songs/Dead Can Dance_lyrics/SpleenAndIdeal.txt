// De Profundis (Out Of The Depths Of Sorrow) //

Embrace the love so fair
Embrace the love so fair

// Circumradiant Dawn //

La Panacea

// The Cardinal Sin //

Sail to the stars
On your shining desires

"Reasons? There are none"
Cried the whisky laden brain
"When all is said and done
It amounts to just the same"

There in your starry eyes
Lie hopes that have been betrayed

The cause of your desire
Can also lead to your demise
When all is said and done
It will be you who pays the price

As countless fools
Are often loathe to testify
"It's an illusion of life
The whole cause of our demise"

Sail to the stars
On your shining desires

Lucretia waits in vain
For the child of her dreams
Within her aching womb
There burns a funeral pyre

There in your starry eyes
Lie hopes that have been betrayed

The prize that you claim
Can never be yours to take
Like castles in Spain
Hope is all that will remain

Abstain from the fools paradise
It's an illusion of life
The whole cause of our desire

(As countless) fools
Are often loathe to testify
"It's an illusion of life
The whole cause of our demise"

Contemplate the world
And its traitors to the soul
The forces of derision
And its legions manifold

Usurpers of the crown
All pretenders to the throne
Your world is linked in chains
"All in one, one in all"

All in one, one in all
All in one, one in all
All in one, one in all
All in one, one in all

All in one, one in all
All in one, one in all
All in one, one in all
All in one, one in all

(As countless) fools
Are often loathe to testify
"It's an illusion of life
The whole cause of our demise"

It's an illusion of life
It's an illusion of life
It's an illusion of life
It's an illusion of life

// Mesmerism //

Frail of heart
Renounce all fear
Locked away inside
All these years
Remain in the light
Renounce all fears
For you have been
Mesmerised
Break this spell
Of silence

// Enigma Of The Absolute //

Saloman hung down her head
Laid bare her heart
For the world to see
She craved for intimacy
Through darkened doors
Her aspect veiled with indecision
Gazed out to sea
She craved lucidity

Cast adrift
Fom past relationships in her life
Hoisted up the ideal
This was her saving grace
Seas of rage that once assailed
Her concern for the truth
Had passed her by
And left her high and dry

In her saviour's arms
In her saviour's arms
In her saviour's arms
In her saviour's arms

Across the sea
Lies the fountain of renewal
Where you will see
The whole cause of your loneliness
Can be measured in dreams
That transcend all these lies
And I wish and I pray
That there may come a day

For a saviour's arms
For a saviour's arms
For a saviour's arms
For a saviour's arms

// Advent //

In the hour of darkness
Our worlds collide
Assailed by madness
That has plagued our lives
At the point of departure
On the eve of despair
Your recourse to reason
Seems to make no sense at all

The light of hope
Shines in your eyes
Dementia has gone
Purged from inside

Throughout our wanderings
In a land of lies
We fell from god's grace
Into a sea of storms
In the self renovation
Celebration of love
These both are virtues
We seem to have left behind

The light of hope
Shines in your eyes
Dementia has gone
Purged from inside

The light of hope
Shines in your eyes
Dementia has gone
Purged from inside

Lay bare your heart
Induce the will of love
To restore what little faith
That you may have lost
As morning brings rebirth a new day will dawn
To ease our troubled minds
Turn away on your side
And dream of days to come

// Indoctrination (A Design For Living) //

In times of great vexation
When one must choose between what's right and wrong
Freedom so they say
Amounts to the choices you have made

Through all the arbitrary
Rationale concerning liberty
Freedom I must say
Exists within unconditioned minds

Reason has come of age

How can you be satisfied with things the way they are
When all that surrounds us now and so much more
Remains inside the keeper's dark embrace?

The insatiable thirst for power has made
Idols out of mortals, gods into clay
Soldiers into heroes, children into slaves
All damned desires, their hopes betrayed

Who will suffer the laws
That state can decide
Your child's education
Unless you pay the price?

Who will suffer the laws?
Who will suffer their minds?
Who will suffer their words?
Who will suffer their designs?

Who will suffer the laws?
Who will suffer their minds?
Who will suffer their words?
Who will suffer their designs?
