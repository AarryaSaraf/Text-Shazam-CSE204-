// Your Ole Handy Man //

I have to mow the lawn
And I have to wash the car
And I'd just like to know
Just who you think you are
I'm gettin' tired of wagging
That old heavy garbage can
Your woman's gettin' tired
Of being your ole handy man

I have to run your water
And I have to wash your back
And I have to scrub the tub
After you have had your bath

You're as helpless as a baby
But I love you, understand
I'm just gettin' tired
Of being your ole handy man

Your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man
Now I know you've got ten fingers
But where's your helpin' hand
I've just made a decision
I've stood all I'm gonna stand
Your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man

I do everything for you
You never help yourself
An' I think I'd die from shock
If you raised a hand to help
Well, I'm not gonna keep it up
That's what you got planned
Your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man

Your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man
Now I know you got ten fingers
But where's that helpin' hand
I've just made a decision
I've stood all I'm gonna stand
Your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man

Your woman's gettin' tired of being your ole handy man

// I Don't Wanna Throw Rice //

She married the one I love today
When my back was turned she took him away
Now while they're all outside, waiting to throw rice
What I want to throw will surely black her eyes
'Cause I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
She took the only love I had
No, I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so bad

Well I never stole nothin' in my life
But if I get the chance I'll steal him from his wife
'Cause all is fair in love and war, maybe I'm carryin' this too far
But I feel like tying dynamite to her side of the car

No I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
She took the only love I had
No, I don't want to throw rice
I want to throw rocks at her
It would be a way to hurt her 'cause she hurt me so bad

// I Wasted My Tears //

I wasted my tears
When I cried over you
I wasted my tears
When I cried over you
I should've known
You would never be true
I loved and I lost you
Now I'm so blue
I wasted my tears
When I cried over you

You said that you loved me
And would always be true
Now you gone'n left me
Oh, what will I do
Oh, why did you leave me
For somebody new
I wasted my tears
When I cried over you

I wasted my time
When I spent it with you
But one is so blind
When love is so new
Now out of my fears have come true
I wasted my tears
When I cried over you

I wasted my tears
When I cried over you

// Something Fishy //

There must be something fishy going on
You said you were goin' on a fishin' trip with some old friend
You said that you'd be home tonight somewhere around ten
Well here it is, it's two o'clock and you're still not at home
I think there's something fishy goin' on

I think that I'm a sucker that's swallowing your line
I try to make myself believe that it's all in my mind
But you never asked me if I'd like to go along
So there must be something fishy goin' on

[Chorus:]
There's something fishy goin' on
On these fishin' trips you're goin' on
I'm gettin' tired of stayin' home alone

Some night when you come home and discover that I'm gone
You can bet there's something fishy goin' on

I guess some large-mouth bass left that lipstick on your shirt
I don't think you're a fisherman, honey
I think you're a flirt
Well if you're goin' fishin' then why don't you bring 'em home
I think there's something fishy goin' on

[Chorus]

Yes, you can bet there's something fishy goin' on

// Fuel To The Flame //

You kindle the fire of love inside me
Each time our lips meet
I'm not strong when we're alone
Your kisses make me weak
You must know how I feel
But do you feel the same
Everytime you kiss me
You add fuel to the flame
My eyes light up when I see you
I burn with desire
Each time you're near
You say you'll care
But still I'm not sure
But please don't ask me to love you
If you're not gonna change my name

Everytime you touch me
You add fuel to the flame
This fire you started inside me
Has reached my very soul
You're adding fuel to a flame
That's already burning out of control
When you give me your name
I give you everything
Everytime you kiss me
Adds fuel to the flame
Yes everytime you touch me
You add fuel to the flame

// The Giving And The Taking //

I keep on a' givin'
And I took all the takin'
I gave all my love to you
And I took all your hurt
I treated you so good
But you treated me like dirt
They say love is give and take
Now my poor heart is breakin'
I keep on a' givin'
And I took all the takin'
I always gave you everything
That I knew how to give I would for you
I treated you too good for my own good
Now I'm along and left forsaken
I keep on a' givin'
And took all the takin'
The giving and the takin'
Has caused my heart to break
I've given all that I can give
And I have taken all that I can take

The giving and the takin'
Has caused my heart to break
I've given all that I can give
And I have takin' all that I can take

// I'm In No Condition //

Don't look at me with love in your eyes
Go look at somebody that can make it worthwhile
I'm hurt from a love affair I didn't want in
I'm in no condition to try to love again
Don't smile at me because it's no use
'Cause I don't have a smile that I can give to you
Someday, you might look me up, but let me be till then
For I'm in no condition to try to love again
I'm in no condition to try to love again

Man I love just broke my heart
And it must have time to mend
He have me the breeze
Now he's gone with the wind
I'm in no condition to try to love again

I'm in no condition to try to love again
Man I love just broke my heart
And it must have time to mend
He have me the breeze
Now he's gone with the wind
I'm in no condition to try to love again

No, I'm in no condition to try to love again

// The Company You Keep //

Yes, you're known by the company you keep
You say you're doin' nothing wrong
I don't believe you are
I'm only trying to help you sis
Before you go too far
Cause I think you're an angel
But folks think that you're cheap
Cause you're known by the company you keep

Please listen to your big sister
I feel I know what's best for you
I feel that I must warn you sis
That's the least that I could do
I'm not accusing you of anything
I know it's fun you see
But you're known by the company you keep

The company you keep keeps you out too long
Mom and dad don't go to sleep until you get home
Sis, you're gettin' in too deep
You'd better look before you leave
Cause you're known by the company you keep

Sis, you're gettin' in too deep
The road of life is steep
And you're known by the company you keep

// I've Lived My Life //

I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen
I left the country for the city
Thought I was smart but I was silly
I should've known I'd get in trouble being so green
I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen
I met a boy and learned to love him
I would have done anything for him
I loved him more than anything I've ever seen

I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen

Only eighteen but its all over
I ruined my life to please my lover
I made him happy, he made me cry
Then said goodbye

I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen

Only eighteen but its all over
I ruined my life to please my lover
I made him happy, he made me cry
Then said goodbye

I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen
I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen

// The Little Things //

You never send me flowers
Or ever buy me candy
You never bring me pretty things
When you come to see me
And you forgot my birthday
Oh I wish you could see
How I miss
The little things
That you don't do for me

You never say that I look nice
Or that you're proud of me
You overlook
The little things
That you should see

These little things are big enough to hurt
But too small to make me want to leave
But I do miss
The little things
That you don't do for me

Now how can I miss flowers
That never reach my door
How can I taste candy
That's still at the candy store

These little things mean a lot to me
To you they may be silly
But I do miss
The little things
That you don't do for me
Yes I miss
The little things
That you don't do for me
