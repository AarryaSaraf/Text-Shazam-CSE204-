// Daddy Was An Old Time Preacher Man //

Daddy was an old time preacher man
He preacher the word of God throughout the land
He preached so plain a child could understand
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man

He told the people of he need to pray
He talked about God's wrath and judgement day
He preached about the great eternity
He preached hell so hot that you could feel the heat

Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man
Aunt Leanona would get up to testify
And we'd sing "In The Sweet By And By"
The we'd sing "I'm On My Way To Canaan Land"
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man

Revivals and camp meetings went for weeks
Folks came from all around to hear him preach
Daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all
But the aisles were always filled at altar calls
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man

Daddy worked for God but asked for no pay
For he believed that God provides a way
We never had a lot but we got by
Guess it's 'cause the Lord was on Daddy's side
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man

// I Know You're Married But I Love You Still //

You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still
The day I met you my heart spoke to me
It said to love you through eternity
Not knowing that you were another's bride
I vowed I'd always be close by your side

You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still

You broke a heart, dear, that would die for you
I'd give this world, dear, to belong to you
The game is over, now I and we've both lost
Our broken hearts will have to pay the cost

You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still

// Thoughtfulness //

Thoughtfulness tenderness makes love grow stronger
Thoughtfulness brings happiness makes love last much longer

Love is like a tender young flower
It needs care from the time you sow
Tender words of love are like summer showers
Makes love strong when cold winds blow

Thoughtfulness tenderness makes love grow stronger
Thoughtfulness brings happiness makes love last much longer

Pull out the weeds of doubt and jealousy give love a chance to grow
Kisses are like sunshine you'll soon see love can bloom even in the snow

Thoughtfulness tenderness makes love grow stronger
Thoughtfulness brings happiness thoughtfulness thoughtfulness

// Fight And Scratch //

Fight and scratch fight and scratch that's all we ever do
There surely must be more to love than to fight and scratch with you
You you to fight and scratch with you

Well, you just bought a foal last month now you want a wig
It looks like you couldn't understand my paycheck ain't that big
Well, what about the dough you lose in them poker games downtown
I figured you'd mention that smart aleck
Yeah, and that brand new boat and that fishin' gear
But no uh-huh I don't reckon that'd count really

Fight and scratch fight and scratch that's all we ever do
There surely must be more to love than to fight and scratch with you
You you to fight and scratch with you

Sometimes I swear I think that you're the devil in disguise
'Cause when you're mad you oughta see the fire fly from your eyes
Well, you don't look so cute yourself when you're mad at me
And if you don't like the way I look then you know how to leave Bossy Catfish

Fight and scratch fight and scratch that's all we ever do
There surely must be more to love than to fight and scratch with you
You you to fight and scratch with you

Well, I love you and you love me but we're always findin' fault
But the way we fight you wouldn't know that we had any love at all
We just fight like cats and dogs we'll leave then come right back
For what excitement would we have if we didn't fight and scratch

Fight and scratch fight and scratch that's all we ever do
There surely must be more to love than to fight and scratch with you
You you to fight and scratch with you

Why don't you drop dead oh you'd like me to and I'll live forever just for spite
Why don't you keep your big mouth shot
Well, why don't you just make me if you think you're big enough
Yeah, and I could whip you with both hands tied behind
Yeah, you just try it with me and I'll knock your brains out
With a stick of soap that's good Catfish
What's a catfish why'd you call me that
They're all mouth and no brains boy that's really good
It's all I can do to keep from laughin' hah
That's funny you sure are a fynny little fellow

// Before Our Weakness Gets Too Strong //

What are we doin' in this place alone
Is our desire to relive our past this strong
The love we knew in the past is gone but our weakness lingers on
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong

Long ago we let the flame of love burn out of control
Now we have no reason to reach for love that has grown cold
If we live our past in the present, our future will be gone
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong

Blind with temptation we race into the past
On a road too small to let the past and present pass
Are we going too fast to turn back and leave the past alone
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong

Long ago we let the flame of love burn out of control
Now we have no reason to reach for love that has grown cold
If we live our past in the present, our future will be gone
Let's go home before our weakness gets too strong

// Once More //

Once more to be with you, dear
Just for tonight to hold you tight
Once more I'd give a fortune
If I could see you once more

Forget the past this hurt can't last
So I don't want it to keep us apart
Your love I need say you'll love me
And say you'll give me all of your heart

Once more to be with you, dear
Just for tonight to hold you tight
Once more I'd give a fortune
If I could see you once more

Once more to be with you, dear
Just for tonight to hold you tight
Once more I'd give a fortune
If I could see you once more

// One Day At A Time //

Life has dealt us our fair share of pain along the way
And many dreams have withered on the vine
But dreams are all such fleeting things and happiness is now
We'll just live our lives one day at a time

In all the stormy weather love has always seen us through
Happiness is knowing that you're mine
Why worry about tomorrow for tomorrow may not come
We'll just live our lives one day at a time

Just one thing I'm learning you take life as it comes
Each day is just a gift so don't be blind
Tomorrow may bring gladness or a little bit of sadness
We'll just live our lives one day at a time

We may not have a fortune making plans to change the world
We may leave little marks in life's design
But as long as we're together every hour is filled with love
And we'll just live our lives one day at a time

Just one thing I'm learning you take life as it comes
Each day is just a gift so don't be blind
Tomorrow may bring gladness or a little bit of sadness
We'll just live our lives one day at a time
We'll just live our lives one day at a time

// Ragged Angel //

Cindy was a ragged angel just a poor little girl on the street
Cindy's eyes showed signs of hunger never had enough to eat
Cindy was a ragged angel golden hair and eyes of blue
Cindy loved her paper dolly that's the only love she knew
Cindy never knew her daddy and her mommie was seldom home
Except for Cindy's paper dolly Cindy was all alone

Cindy slept with her paper dolly on a blanket on the floor
She would shiver as the wind blew through the crack beneath the door
One night she laid with her paper dolly cold and hungry on the floor
That night God came for the ragged angel
And now Cindy won't ever be cold and hungry no not anymore
Ragged angel

// A Good Understanding //

When we married we agreed that we'd both do as we please
Just as long as we done each other right
Through the years our love has grown now our love is twice as strong
'Cause we've got a good understanding

Yes, we've got a good understanding
And a love that has never been demanding
We both love each other so and that's all we need to know
'Cause we've got a good understanding

It's been your unselfish love that has always helped me up
When temptation reached out its hand to see
And when I could have gone wrong I would think of you at home
And I'd think about our good understanding

Yes, we've got a good understanding
And a love that has never been demanding
We both love each other so and that's all we need to know
'Cause we've got a good understanding

// Let's Live For Tonight //

Let's live for tonight dear it's better that way
Tomorrow we might be apart
Let's live for tonight dear let love have its way
For tomorrow we could have two broken hearts

Let's cast all our worries and heartaches aside
Forget what the future might hold
Let's live for tonight dear in a world all our own
For tomorrow we may have to be alone

Let's live for tonight dear and try to pretend
That we will never be alone
No matter what happened this night will be ours
What tomorrow brings nobody ever knows
For tomorrow we may have to be alone
