// The River That Runs With Love Won't Run Dry //

Oh my father, he was born beneath the water 
And my mother, she was born to no one's daughter 
And I, I was born beneath the dying sun 
Born from the mouth of a river that would not run dry 

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la lie 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la lie 
Oh, the river that runs with love, it won't run dry 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la lie 

Well, I awoke this morning in the blackest night 
And a million stars were aching in the sullen sky 
And I heard the great machines as they bled and cried 
And I saw the end of the world, I had no question why 

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la lie 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la lie 
Hold on to the one you love and kiss her before she dies 
Oh, the river that runs with love, it won't run dry

Oh, my father made the water when he cried
But the river that runs with love, it won't run dry
And the sun will burn a hole in the purple sky 
But the river that runs with love, it won't run dry

// Let It Come Down //

Some men are made of steel and blood 
Some fall from Heaven when their time does come
Some of us, we run from a shapeless form 
And some men, they hide from a howling storm 

Now I will wander through the falling flames
And I will drown in the burning rain 
Sha la la la la la la, let it come down 
Sha la la la la la la, let it come down 

There is a place with nothing to gain 
There lies the lover who has broken no chain
He sits by the window and he stares at the dark
She feels for the knife that will split his heart 

Now we are betrayed in the cold, black pain
And a fire will rain down again and again 
Sha la la la la la la, let it come down 
Sha la la la la la la, let it come down

// Can't Find My Way Home //

Come down off your throne and leave your body alone
Somebody must change
You are the reason I've been waiting so long
Somebody holds the key
But I'm near the end and I just ain't got the time
And I'm wasted and I can't find my way home

Come down on your own and leave your body alone
Somebody must change
You are the reason I've been waiting all these years
Somebody holds the key

But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
But I can't find my way home
Still I can't find my way home
And I ain't done nothing wrong
But I can't find my way home

// Mona Lisa, Mother Earth //

Tonight, I'll spend the night in Mona Lisa's bed 
She'll hide this beaten man beneath her innocence 
Tonight, no dream's denied in Mona Lisa's mind 
We'll ride a drowning world through the cold black sky 

Mona Lisa, Mother Earth 
Mona Lisa, Mother Earth 
My mind's an ocean in Mona Lisa's hand 
She dreams a hiding world where the water runs red 

Tonight, my dreams are born on Mona Lisa's breast 
We'll walk a burning world where the sun shines darkness 
Mona Lisa, Mother Earth 
Mona Lisa, Mother Earth

// (She's A) Universal Emptiness //

And she sits there by the wall
Making holes where I just stood
And her hands, they touch her face
Like her face is made of wood

And she holds onto a memory
Of something I never said
But she still can't quite remember
If my eyes are blue or dead

She's the mother of us all
She's the victim of my sadness
And the more she tries to know it
The more she'll never fill it

She's a universal emptiness
A universal emptiness
She's a universal emptiness
And a total lack of faith

And I saw her once before
Down on her bended knees
Through a window of the church at night
Confessing to the broken priest

She is holy, as all women are
And she suffers like a saint
Yeah, she touched my hand with cruelty
But I was punished far too late

She's the mother of us all
She's the victim of my sadness
And the more she tries to know it
The more she'll never fill it

She's a universal emptiness
A universal emptiness
She's a universal emptiness
And a total lack of faith

// Saved //

Now I've got nothing to look at 
And I've got no pain to deny 
And I've got nobody to bleed for 
And I've got no sun to pull down from the sky
But I'm saved, yeah, I'm saved 
And I don't understand it, I'm saved 

If mercy were to hold me closely 
And hide me in her place of no pain 
The angels would throw down the water 
They cried from one hundred million eyes

And I have a feeling that's growing 
Somewhere behind my sleeping mind 
Yeah, I'm saved, I'm saved 
Yeah, I don't know why, but I'm saved

When sunlight falls on your shoulder 
You look like a creature from Heaven 
You're holy when you open your eyes 
And look up inside that sheltering sky 

And you're an angel, I'll never betray you 
But I'll always be a lonely child 
Yeah, still I'm saved 
I'm saved 
Yeah, I don't deserve it 
But I'm saved

// I Remember Who You Are //

When other people say you're someone to misuse 
Shut in behind your young girl's face 
And helpless in your bed of thorns 
I'll remember who you are 
Yes, I'll remember who you are 
I'll remember who you are
A young girl, unchained 

Come back here now 
I know you're somewhere still alive 
Strong behind your young girl's tears 
I know you're somewhere, unchanged

Oh, I remember who you are
Yes, I remember who you are 
I remember who you are
A young girl, unchained 

There stands a young girl, naked 
In her innocence unused 
And she holds me in her small hand 
And she smiles down on me 

I am innocent in her dark eyes 
I will lose my heart in the sand 
You're cruel, but you're good for me 
And you hold me in your young girl's hand 

I remember who you are 
Yes, I remember who you are 
I remember who you are 
A young girl, unchained

// Jane Mary, Cry One Tear //

I live in an empty house
There's no one there but memory and me

But I loved a woman once
One hundred years ago, for a while
When she left here, she was filled with hatred
And with a second child

Now, I heard nothing ever changes
But nothing I touch has stayed the same
Everything just turns to poison
That I have loved or made

So bury my children's children
In a deep and lonely grave
Anything is a cause for sorrow
That my mind or body has made

There's a fire on the water
There's a hole in the sky
There's the Devil coming down for me
To this room where I'll die

There's a man with a black heart
He's standing there up on the hill
He's lifting up with his burning hands
A fire that does not kill

He's calling down to me alone
He's calling down to me alone
He says, "Get down on your knees and cry alone
No one will cry for you"

So Jane Mary, cry one tear
Jane Mary, cry just one tear for me
Jane Mary, cry one tear
Jane Mary, cry just one tear for me

// See No More //

See God's sun go down behind that hill
See God's sons go down that lonely road 
See God's sun fall behind that hill in darkness 
See God's sons go down that godforsaken road 

Then see us need more 
Then see no more 
Then see no more 
Then see no more 

See us deliver where other men will fail 
See us hold Heaven while others burn in Hell 
See us, God's sons, guarding Heaven's gate
Then see our sun go black because we made one mistake 

Then see us need more 
Then see no more
Then see no more 
Then see no more

// God Damn The Sun //

When, when we were young, we had no history 
So nothing to lose meant we could choose 
Choose what we wanted then
Without any fear or thought of revenge 

But then you grew old and I lost my ambition 
So I gained an addiction to drink and depression 
(They are mine, my only true friends 
And I'll keep them with me until the very end)

I'd choose not to remember, but I miss your arrogance 
And I need your intelligence and your hate for authority 
But now you're gone, I read it today
They found you in Spain, face down in the street 
With a bottle in your hand and a wild smile on your face 
And a knife in your back

You died in a foreign land and they found my letter 
Rolled up in your pocket 
Where I said I'd kill myself if she left me again 
So now she's gone and you're both in my mind 
I've got one thing to say before I am drunk again

Goddamn the sun 
Goddamn the sun 
Goddamn anyone that says a kind word 
Goddamn the sun
Goddamn the sun 
Goddamn the light
It shines and this world it shows 
Goddamn the sun
