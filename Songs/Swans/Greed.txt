Album: Greed

// A Fool //

I'll lie to myself
I'll lie to myself
I'll lie down here
I'll lie down here
I'll Lie down beside you
I'll Lie down beside you
I'll lie to myself
I'll lie to myself
I'll believe in myself
I'll believe in myself
I'll believe in a lie
I'll believe in a lie
I'll believe in a lie
I'll believe in myself

I'll cut off my right hand and stand in your shadow
I'll cut off my right hand and stand in your shadow
I'll lie to myself
I'll lie to myself
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go

I'll crawl all over myself and stand in your shadow
I'll crawl all over myself and stand in your arms
I'll lie to myself
I'll lie to myself

// Anything For You //

Force yourself on me.
I know where my money comes from.
I'll do anything for you.
When your hands in my mouth I'll force it down.
I'll force it down in me.
Hold it in, take it out of me.
Push me, I'll move.
I'll do anything for you.

// Nobody //

I mean nothing to myself.
I mean nothing to myself.
I'm nothing, I'm nobody.
I hate my body, I'm stuck in myself.
I'm nothing, I'm nobody.
I don't move, I'm stuck in myself.
I hate my body, I'm stuck in myself.
I'm nothing, I'm nobody.
I'm nothing, I'm nobody.
Glory! glory! glory!
Glory! glory! glory!

// Stupid Child //

I'm your stupid child.
I'm your stupid naked child.
I'm your stupid helpless child.
I'm ashamed of what I am.
I like the way that feels.
I like the way that burns me.
I like the way that dulls me.
I like the way that cuts me down.
I'm your stupid child.
I'm your stupid child.

// Greed //

You're body is warm.
You're hiding yourself.
Sleep on this bed.
Cover yourself.
Nothing will go wrong.
Protect yourself.
Sleep on this bed.
Hold on to yourself.
Nothing will go wrong.
Nothing will go wrong.

// Heaven //

It's all right, we're in heaven.
This is heaven, we're in heaven.
Our body's broken.
The earth is moving.
Our bodies breathing.
Our blood is moving.
It's all right, we're in heaven.
It's all right, we're in heaven.

// Money Is Flesh //

Money's flesh, money's flesh in your hands
Money's flesh, money's flesh in your hands
Money is flesh
Money means flesh in your hand
Money is flesh
Money is flesh in your hand
When you pay, you're a servant
When you pay, you're a servant
When you pay, you're a servant
When you pay, you're a servant
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it

You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it

Money's easy
To get out your flesh
Money's easy
To get out your flesh
When you pay, you deserve it
When you pay, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it, you deserve it
You deserve it

// Time Is Money (Bastard) //

Your body is private.
Your mind is sacred.
You should be violated.

Someone less privileged then you should use you.
Someone weaker then you should rape you.
You should be violated.
You should be violated.
You should be raped.
You should be raped.
You should be raped.
You should be raped.
Don't fight back.
Don't fight back.
I need you.
Don't fight back.
Don't fight back.

// Sealed In Skin //

Wrap your skin around my skin
I don't feel your body
Wrap your mouth around my mouth
I don't feel your body
Hold you hands over my eyes
I don't feel myself when you hold me down
I hide in your warmth
