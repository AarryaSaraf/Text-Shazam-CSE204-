// Slipknot //

Law don't go 'round here, savvy

Pentex sucks, Pentex sucks
They drain the life force of my tribe
Pentex sucks
Bone Gnawers suck, Bone Gnawers suck
They roll around in garbage bins
All Bone Gnawers suck
(Pentex is bleeding
But night is dawning)

The Black Hand sucks, the Black Hand sucks
Those wyrm-tainted bastard leeches
Black Hand sucks
If I had my way, if I had my way
I'd rend them all ripped and torn
All that sucks dies
(Sweet smell bleeding
Glow is melting me)

I bring my klave into battle
Shifting into Crinos
I slay Wyrmfoe
Then I step sideways
You (oh)
You (you) (oh)

You can't see me, for I hide within the Umbra
You can't see me, for I hide within the Umbra
You can't see me, for I hide within the Umbra
You can't see me, for I hide within the Umbra

// Do Nothing / Bitchslap //

The system has failed, and you have failed with it
No time to care. Just time to say, "Who gives a shit?"
My mind boils as I've decided I'm through
Fuck your position in life, I'm taking vengeance on you
I break down the walls of the political arena
Cast the vote on FN-FAL, yeah, we'll be seeing ya

Come on, y'all
Yeah!
I want
To put a cap right in your asshole
You step to this
You're gonna pass for
A lump of dog shit in the grass, now
Be on your way and get some class
(Bitchslap)
(Bitchslap)
(Bitchslap)
(Bitchslap)
(Bitchslap)
(Bitchslap)
(Bitchslap)
(Bitchslap)

Man, you're like a school in the summer
No class!

Aah
Chop down the big-wigs
Shoot the televisions, too!
My mind boils in life
As I've decided I'm through
The guilty of crimes
Will be hung from the trees
Spit and punches arise
From you and the me

Sit back and do nothing
If that's what you want to do
I will have my reign as king
When I take vengeance on you

// Confessions //

I know you don't want to see
I know you're not part of me
But you wonder just the same
So I'll let you in on this game

What's on the top is just the beginning
Of the protectorate that keeps Gaia spinning
It never ends, and with the gifts Luna sends to the apocalypse
On, we defend for the right to live in a perfect world
For our past mistakes, extinction we are hurled
Trying to make amends for the Impergium
As Weaver and the Wyld and a bitch called the Wyrm

You don't wanna know
All the power of the Wyld that runs through me
Yet the reason why is an answer that eludes me
You don't wanna see
Our viewpoint on what hominids are doing
That black inside when frenzy is brewing
You don't wanna feel
The sorrow that my heart holds in knowing
Just where my hopes and dreams are going
I won't let you be
Caught up in a war that you are not part of
I sign this letter, "Your father, with love"

I'm tryna set my mind free
I'm sorry you never knew me
My soul is in recession
Painful to make this confession!

You don't wanna know
All of the power of the Wyld that runs through me
Yet the reason why is an answer that eludes me
You don't wanna see
Our viewpoint on what hominids are doing
That black inside when frenzy is brewing
You don't wanna feel
The sorrow that my heart holds in knowing
Just where my hopes and dreams are going
I won't let you be
Caught up in a war that you are not part of
I sign this letter, "Your father, with love"

Love!

// Some Feel //

Some feel I don't exist
Never believing what they see
Some feel that I'm not fair
I leave no time for repentance
Tearing the veil, mending the veil
Tearing the veil
Tearing the veil, mending the veil
Tearing the veil

Some feel I bear the mark of man
A misguided philosophy
Some feel I kill for fun
I kill for life
I can't escape what Gaia's left for me 
I can't deny the lack of morality
I can't believe (no) what Gaia's left for me (more)
I can't escape (no) the lack of morality (less)

Need time to think, need time to think
Need to spill blood so I can drink
Take what they give, take what they give
Some feel I'm dead, yet I still live!
Need time to think, need time to think
Need to spill blood so I can drink
Take what they give, take what they give
Some feel I'm dead, yet still I live!
Low!

They don't know I'm eternal
They don't know they're just cattle
They don't know I'm eternal
Eternal!

// Killers Are Quiet //

Cycle of life and death supposedly
Goes 'round and 'round yet it stops with me
Glorious hunters of my faith, I have sinned
Killers are quiet like the breath of the wind

Filling the shadows with forms of my own
Raised by kindred of Get I was born
Abomination world in disarray
Killers are quiet when they seek the vitae

Reflection beckons a portal shard
Spiritual quest I must stay on guard
Stepping sideways between worlds I shift
Killers are quiet when they're born with the gift

Beautiful anguish cast out by my race
Now one that's ageless I save my own face
I write my own laws with death, I break bread
Killers are quiet when they come from my head!

Run! Run! Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run! Run!

// Dogfish Rising //

There's a dog loose in the wood

Dogfish risin'
It's good fo' gnawin'
Right-wing in lieu
In the 1990s
Mm
That's got a nice groove to it there
I give [?]
I saw a human hand
Windmills like two
Somethin' at my left
(Screaming sphincter muscles)
Post-sniff scrunchies
What the?

Dogfish risin'
Burn them for their nipples
'Nother rubber Rolex
So skinny odd knows
Who wrote these -in' lyrics?

Battery-powered power tool
Black and decker dildos
Fully-covered pocket
(Pop it with bullets) Pop it with balls
God spokes to me
Hootie

Dogfish risin'
Blistered cabbage
Poor fish toenail
Poor thing crawls
Why take free lotion?
Hmm

Lactate freely
Back bunk mushrooms
Foot, clip, lick mud
Redneck percussion
Back off fuck-head!

Dogfish risin'
Pinted carpet art
Pinpoint penis blood
Quarter-inch off fat
What are you laughin' at?

[?] squeegee
Crisp cookie crisp food finger
Bug raw in stick wit
Quit corn beef scotus
Fuck it! That dogfish is dead

I'm gettin' the hell out of here, guys
See ya later
Have a good life
Don't even bother payin' me
Fuck this
It pours the lotion on the skin
It pours the lotion on the skin
New dick slick rod
The goddamn lotions
Smithers?
([?] get you guys could afford to record this in a real studio)
Yes, Mr. Burns? (Sick [?] fuckin')
Bring me this band
Extra supreme hold on my yearn saddle kids college special
Those biscuits are in abundance tonight
Alright! [?]
(Sniff my fannies, please!)
(And my creamer!)
(Sniff my creamer, you motherfucker!)
(Sniff my fannies, please!)
([?] skinner)
Crusty, fuzzy nuts
Bye!
