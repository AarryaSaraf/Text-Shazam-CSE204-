It appears that we have reached the edge, that zenith where stimuli and comatose collide
Forty years ago, the man proclaimed the age of the gross to be upon us, and even though the man was destroying our heritage and insulting our intelligence, that era has become very real
We labor for pleasure and abhor the guilt of pressure
My generation will go down as the architects of contemporary disgust
Some have fought and died
Others have allowed the strong to be butchered for a price they themselves don't care about and will never understand
I myself am beleaguered by the selfish face of a kind of man that is NOT MANKIND
Distrust in information
Fundamentalism of opinion
Catastrophic boredom, and a fanatical devotion to that which does not matter
Where is your glory now, people?
Where are your gods and politicians?
Where is your shame and salvation?
You rage for no reason because you have no reason

What have you ever fought for?
What have you ever bled for?
The face of the earth is scarred with the walking dead
The age of the gross is a living virus
This is the future you have created
This is the world you have set ablaze
All your lies are coming true
All freedom is lost
All hope is gone

// Gematria (The Killing Name) //

12/08/73, that was all I got, and now you got me
All I ever really wanted was to take the blame
I will go down in history and not down in flames
Meningitis, I will survive this
Dry sockets and a schizophrenic crisis
The Time of the Nine has begun
Get out of the way or you will suffer as one
Oh, this is so typical, apocalyptical
Hanging on abysmal release, Jesus
I don't need this, don't wanna be this
Icon in the making, my hands are fucking shaking

What if God doesn't care?
What if God doesn't care?

Remember, surrender
The time is now
Continue, we're in you
And we will burn your cities down

America is a killing name
It doesn't feel or discriminate
Life is just a killing field
It's all that's left, nothing's real
Throw away your disposable past
And fall apart like a cigarette ash
We are the fatal and vital ones of the world
And we will burn your cities down

What if God doesn't care?
What if God doesn't care?

Oh

America is a killing name
It doesn't feel or discriminate
Life is just a killing field
It's all that's left, nothing's real
Throw away your disposable past
And fall apart like a cigarette ash
We are the fatal and vital ones of the world
And we will burn your cities down

Down, ha
We will burn your cities down
We will burn your cities down
Yeah, we will burn your cities down

Feed the hungry, feed them shit
Feed them bones and politics
You wanna revolutionize?
Be specific and believe your eyes
Start a war in another backyard
And we'll destroy your house of cards
Give me a minute and I'll change your mind
Give me a bullet and I'll change your life

Remember, surrender
The time is now
Continue, we're in you
And we will burn your cities down

America is a killing name
It doesn't feel or discriminate
Life is just a killing field
It's all that's left, nothing's real
Throw away your disposable past
And fall apart like a cigarette ash
We are the fatal and vital ones of the world
And we will burn your cities down

Down, down
We will burn your cities down
Down, down
We will burn your cities down

America, what if God doesn't care?
What if God doesn't care?

// Sulfur //

My guilt and my shame
Always sell me short, always feel the same
And my face and my soul
Always wear me thin, always under control
But the longest hours you'll have in your life
Are the ones you sit through to know if you're right
So I'll wait, but I'll pray that I'm wrong
Because I think I know what's going on

So let me get this straight
The only will is my own
I do whatever I want and stay alone
All my decisions make it, untouchable and tainted
I'm gonna suffer for the rest of my life
But I will always find a way to survive
I'm not a failure, but I know what it's like
I can take it or leave it or die

Stay, you don't always know where you stand
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like breathing in sulfur

My life is undone
And I'm a sinner to most but a sage to some
And my gods are untrue
I'm probably wrong but I'm better than you
And the longest hours I've had in my life
Were the ones I went through to know I was right
So I'm safe but I'm a little outside
I'm gonna laugh when I'm buried alive

Stay, you don't always know where you stand
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like breathing in sulfur

Like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur

Stay, you don't always know where you stand
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
Like breathing in sulfur

Stay, you don't always know where you stand
(You don't always know where you stand)
'Til you know that you won't run away
There's something inside me that feels
(There's something inside me that feels)
Like breathing in sulfur

Like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur

// Psychosocial //

Ooh, yeah!

I did my time and I want out
So effusive, fade, it doesn't cut
The soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion
Pseudo-sacrosanct perversion
Go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
I'm done, it has begun, I'm not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
We throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

Psychosocial!
Psychosocial!
Psychosocial!
Psychosocial!
Psychosocial!
Psychosocial!

There are cracks in the road we laid
But where the temple fell
The secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new, but when we killed it all
The hate was all we had
Who needs another mess?
We could start over
Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
Now there's only emptiness
Venomous, insipid
I think we're done, I'm not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
We throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

Psychosocial!
Psychosocial!
Psychosocial!
Psychosocial!

Psychosocial!

The limits of the dead!
The limits of the dead!
The limits of the dead!
The limits of the dead!

Fake anti-fascist lie (Psychosocial!)
I tried to tell you but (Psychosocial!)
Your purple hearts are giving out (Psychosocial!)
Can't stop a killing idea - (Psychosocial!)
If it's hunting season (Psychosocial!)
Is this what you want? (Psychosocial!)
I'm not the only one!

And the rain will kill us all
We throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

And the rain will kill us all
We throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

The limits of the dead

// Dead Memories //

Sitting in the dark, I can't forget
Even now, I realize the time I'll never get
Another story of the bitter pills of fate
I can't go back again. I can't go back again

But you asked me to love you and I did
Traded my emotions for a contract to commit

And when I got away, I only got so far
The other me is dead
I hear his voice inside my head

We were never alive, and we won't be born again
But I'll never survive with dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart

You told me to love you and I did. Tied my soul into a knot and got me to submit

So when I got away, I only kept my scars
The other me is gone
Now I don't know where I belong

And we were never alive, and we won't be born again
But I'll never survive with dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart

Dead visions in your name
Dead fingers in my veins
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart
Dead memories in my heart, oh
Oh oh whoa
Oh oh whoa
Oh oh whoa

// Vendetta //

I know my uses, I have my pride
But my heart is still untamed
I learn my lessons, I've conquered death
I go on, and I'm unashamed
I'll paint your bones to match my eyes
They're the darkest I have ever seen
Until I'm lucid, I can't be told
I know my voices, they tell me to believe

Another fuckin' accident out of control
All the attitudes will never change
My imitations are leading the way
I can't accept that I still don't find this strange
In light of my ability to feel denial
I walk away from everything with just a smile
The agony of coming home has gone away
It's everywhere, it's everyone, it's every day

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Are you ready for the time of your life?
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Are you ready for the time of your life?

I beg your pardon, I'm out of the way
A new conspiracy has taken my place
So over and over I smell the decay
Believe what you want to, the cycle stays the same
In light of my ability to undermine
I walk away from apathy, I'm feeling fine
The agony of cynicism beckons me
It's everywhere, it's everyone, it's everything

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Are you ready for the time of your life?
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Are you ready for the time of your life?

(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)

// Butcher's Hook //

Contrite, commercial
Arrogance, leprosy
Consume the bitch, the fucker
Mindless, like a child
For pity's sake, I've had all that I can take
We try, but in the end, we'll see
There are no more codes
Only who is shit and who's still free
I was gonna change the world with honor and aggression
No one listened, no one cared
All they saw was misdirection

(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)

(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again

I don't want you anymore (I don't want you anymore)
I don't need you anymore (I don't need you anymore)
Fingerprint of God
Your new religions covet
This vessel wasn't built to last
But I will live forever
You'll never have to say surrender
Because you're so part of it
My total honesty has no place for tomorrow
Guilty pleasures give me pain
Tell my people I can't follow

(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again

You'll never censor me
You better cherish me
My reason has a voice
Freedom's gone but we'll always have a choice
My present future tense
It doesn't make much sense
I'm coming after you
Fuck you all, I'm the only point of view

Oh, violence and dollar signs
Another processed piece of shit
You hide your fault in diamonds
And give away the only
Cost, you can't delay the inevitable
Lost, don't understand the incredible path
I'm losing ground, but I won't care when I go down

(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again
(Go ahead and disagree)
I'm giving up again

// Gehenna //

Do you believe?
Do you fade like a dream?
Let me hear you breathe, let me watch as you sleep
The sparrow's eyes
Promises shift into judgments
I cannot deny that you were designed for my punishments

The blood and the body control the cut, so it's seamless
Show me your heart, show me the way to complete this
Tethered to a scene, I treasure, can you help me?
I sever, God, it's perfect, it's never really perfect
Now, I can finally be myself 'cause I don't wanna be myself

Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)

I cannot maintain a semblance of normal anymore
I'd rather feel pain than try to fit in with you anymore
I'll throw it all away like everybody else
I can finally be myself 'cause I don't wanna be myself

Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)

Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)
Free my severed heart, give me you
I want it (I don't wanna be myself)

// This Cold Black //

Welcome home

Mother nature is a coward (Mother nature is a whore)
No more presence, no more power (I pray for death, by the hour)
Cut another smile into me (Into me is all you are)
My artifice won't recognize me (You won't find me anymore)
Post-traumatic war machines
The pessimists still won't believe
Throw away my past mistakes
It's all I came to feel
Let my weapons be your children
Let my armies be your damned
Try to suffer on in silence
Try to stop me if you can

Pneumatic destroyer
Pathetic seducer
Distortion sufficient
Some day, (Some day) one day (One day)
We'll live our lives again

My ghosts have found their way back home
I have every right to kill my own (Every right to kill my own)
I am something now that never could exist
My anguish conquers all
Pay the price and watch me fall
My only key is broken
My broken key is only me

Pneumatic destroyer
Pathetic seducer
Distortion sufficient
Some day, (Some day) one day (One day)
We'll live our lives again

You utter waste of tired flesh
It doesn't matter if you can't progress
Even now they still create me
Give me your ignorance, irritate me
I am made of the same debris
You want it all, but you didn't want me
Hypocrite with no real use
I'm alive, what's your excuse?

Pneumatic destroyer
Pathetic seducer
Distortion sufficient
Some day, (Some day) one day (One day)
We'll live our lives again

Pneumatic destroyer
Pathetic seducer
Distortion sufficient
Some day, (Some day) one day (One day)
We'll live our lives again

We'll live our lives again

// Wherein Lies Continue //

Thou shalt not

Kill your fathers, destroy another life
Question everything we clung to for years
Live forever, design a better death
Confuse a liar with a savior from fear
Create a myth and separate the chosen ones
Adolescent independence, dominion
I only wanna believe in fucking anything
But now my conscience is contradicting everything

The ending's the same
The world will not change
The answer is clear

Tell your mothers they have no sons or daughters
Blame yourselves because your children are mine
We are orphans, but we are not forgotten
And we will find a way to save us this time
We can run, but we are tired of running
We're dropping seconds in a glass 'til we die
We only wanna believe in fucking everything
But we're alive, and we're not accepting anything

The ending's the same
The world will not change
The answer is clear
Annihilation

I won't control or restrain
Things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger, better
They gave to me, now I give to you
The means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm stronger, better, more

We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves

I will never become another piece
Inside the paralytic construct I hate
Live forever, well I would rather die
At least I'd know I wasn't theirs to create
This is yours, but you had better choose
Before they take away your right to decide
I guess I'll never believe in fucking anything
But my solace is I can handle everything

The ending's the same
The world will not change
The answer is clear
Obliteration

I won't control or restrain
Things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger, better
They gave to me, now I give to you
The means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm stronger, better

I won't control or restrain
Things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger, better
They gave to me, now I give to you
The means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm stronger, better, more

We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves

// Snuff //

Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

So if you love me, let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there
Deliver me into my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh my smile was taken long ago
If I can change I hope I never know

I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light (Without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

So save your breath, I will not hear
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough?
I only wish you weren't my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh my own was banished long ago
It took the death of hope to let you go

Oh, oh

So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself
And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away, you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
Ooh my love was punished long ago
If you still care, don't ever let me know
If you still care, don't ever let me know

// All Hope Is Gone //

The state of the nation – violation
A broken promise is as good as a lie
The hell is humongous, the devil's among us
And we will burn 'cause we won't unite
What are we conceding for our freedom?
Why does anybody think we need 'em?
I would rather fight than let another die
We're the problem, but we're also the solution
All hope is gone
If you want it, come and take it from me
If you think you can, you still don't know me
Let me tell you, man, if I said it, I meant it
And I will always have the right to defend it
Fifty seconds, a hundred murders
The bill of rights is a bill of sale
What will you do when the war is over?
What will you do when your system fails?

We have made the present obsolete
What do you want? What do you need?
We'll find a way when all hope is gone
We've seen the fall of the elite
Bury your life, take your disease
We'll end the world when all hope is gone

We have made the present obsolete
What do you want? What do you need?
We'll find a way when all hope is gone
We've seen the fall of the elite
Bury your life, take your disease
We'll end the world when all hope is gone

The wretched are the wounded
The hungry starve to death
In a place where no one goes
The air itself is a final breath
So discontinue the antiseptic care charade
As a cry of justice comes, a malignant fire fades
I am the reason your future suffers
I am the hatred you won't embrace
I am the worm of a pure gestation
I am the remedy, spit in my face
All your laws and rules are outdated
All your subjects are killing the kings
I can rattle off a million other reasons why
But does it matter when the only thing we love will die?

We have made the present obsolete
What do you want? What do you need?
We'll find a way when all hope is gone
We've seen the fall of the elite
Bury your life, take your disease
We'll end the world when all hope is gone

We have made the present obsolete
What do you want? What do you need?
We'll find a way, we'll find a way when all hope is gone
We've seen the fall of the elite
Bury your life, take your disease
We'll end the world, we'll end the world when all hope is gone

When all hope is gone
When all hope is gone
When all hope is gone

// Child Of Burning Time //

Child of burning time
Child of burning time

My only consolation is all lies
The apex of my consequence is dying here tonight
Winter hasn't ended, and it always looks like rain
I can't remember anything, anything

Inside the absolution we succumb
And appetites are bittersweet, I think I'm going numb
A chance to give up Avarice has marked my one regret
The child of burning time is gone, he hasn't come back yet

Before I tell my story please consider who I am
I missed my window years ago, I'm doing all I can
A tragedy is commonplace but in the end they go away
My skin is still the only stain I'm left to wear in shame

I cut my name into my heart
I'll tear it all apart

I beg you burn me away
I won't become your hero just to fight the life I saved
Burn me away
I won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all today

I'll burn away
I'll burn away
I'll burn away
I'll burn away

My isolation is my course
The effect it has on life itself is a cancer on its source
I rue the moments spent between the fetish and the flame
Until this war is over I won't ever lose my rage

I cut my name into my soul
I guess I'll never know

I beg you burn me away
I won't become your hero just to fight the life I saved
Burn me away
I won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all today

Burn me away
I won't become your hero just to fight the life I saved
Burn me away
I won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all, lose it all today

// Vermilion Pt. 2 (Bloodstone Mix) //

She seemed dressed in all of me
Stretched across my shame
All the torment and the pain
Leaked through and covered me

I'd do anything to have her to myself
Just to have her for myself
Now I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad

She is everything to me
The unrequited dream
A song that no one sings
The unattainable

She's a myth that I have to believe in
All I need to make it real is one more reason
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
When she makes me sad

But I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me

I catch in my throat
Choke
Torn into pieces
I won't - no
I don't wanna be this

But I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me
I won't let this build up inside of me

Won't let this build up inside of me
Won't let this build up inside of me

She isn't real
(Won't let this build up inside of me)
I can't make her real
(Won't let this build up inside of me)
She isn't real
(Won't let this build up inside of me)
I can't make her real
(Won't let this build up inside of me)

// Til We Die //

My friends are all hurting from moments and regrets and charity laced with a lie
And still we keep hoping, to fix all the defects and strengthen these seminal ties
We go on together for better or worse, our history is too real to hate
Now and forever we stay until morning, and promise to fight for our fate

'Til we die
'Til we die

The start of the journey is every bit worth it, I can't let you down anymore
The sky is still clearing, we're never afraid and the consequence opens the door
I've never stopped trying, I've never stopped feeling like family is much more than blood
Don't go on without me, the piece that I represent complements each and every one

'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win

'Til we die
'Til we die

My last true confession will open your eyes, I've never known trust like the nine
Let it be spoken, let it be screamed, they'll never ever take us alive

'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win

Carry on
Carry on

We'll never be broken, we won't be denied, our war is the pressure we need to unite
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied, our war is the pressure we need to unite

'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win

Carry on
Carry on

We'll never be broken, we won't be denied, our war is the pressure we need to unite

'Til we die
'Til we die
'Til we die

We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied, our war is the pressure we need to unite
