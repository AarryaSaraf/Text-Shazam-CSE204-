// Gently //

Gently my mind escapes into the relaxing world of pleasure
A pleasure that'll take my mind off the reality of my life
My past life

Life as I know it now
And whatever may come
It slowly disappears to somewhere in the back of my mind
It will remain there 'til I wish to retrieve it

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Oh
Yeah
Yeah

Yes, I will stay here for awhile
For I need a break
A break from the pressures of life
And everything that lays in the palms of life's hands

Ooh, life's hands
Yeah
Ooh

This mode is incredible
It's out of this world
Too bad I must always leave it
But that's life, yeah

That's life, yeah
That's life, yeah
That's life, yeah
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Oh, yes

// (515) //

Death
Death
Death
Death
Death

// People = Shit //

Yeah!
(Oh!)
Yeah!
Wargh!
Yeah!
Come on!
Here we go again, motherfucker
Yeah

Come on down and see the idiot right here
Too fucked to beg and not afraid to care
What's the matter with calamity anyway?
Right? Get the fuck outta my face
Understand I can't feel anything
It isn't like I wanna sift through the decay
I feel like a wound like I got a fucking gun against my head
You live when I'm dead

One more time, motherfucker

Everybody hates me now, so fuck it
Blood's on my face and my hands
And I don't know why I'm not afraid to cry
But that's none of your business
Whose life is it? Get it? See it? Feel it? Eat it?
Spin it around so I can spit in its face
I wanna leave without a trace
'Cause I don't wanna die in this place

People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit

People equal shit, what you gonna do?
People equal shit, 'cause I'm not afraid of you
People equal shit, I'm everything you'll never be
People equal shit, yeah!

Yeah!
Come on!

It never stops, you can't be everything to everyone
Contagion, I'm sitting at the side of Satan
What do you want from me?
They never told me the failure I was meant to be, ya
Overdo it, don't tell me you blew it
Stop your bitching and fight your way through it
I'm not like you, I just fuck up
Come on, motherfucker, everybody has to die
Come on, motherfucker, everybody has to die

Oh
People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit

People equal shit, yeah
People equal shit, yeah
People equal shit, yeah
People equal shit, oh

People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit, what you gonna do?
People equal shit, 'cause I'm not afraid of you
People equal shit, I'm everything you'll never be
People equal shit

Got that, right?

// Disasterpiece //

Hold on to something

Yeah, I wanna slit your throat and fuck the wound
Wanna push my face in and feel the swoon
Wanna dig inside, find a little bit of me
'Cause the line gets crossed when you don't come clean
My wormwood meets your pesticide
You'll never get out 'cause you were never alive
I am infinite, I am the infant finite
Come a little closer, and I'll show you why

No one is safe
Noises, noises, people make noises
People make noises when they're sick
Nothing to do except hold on to nothing
No one is safe
Noises, noises, people make noises
People make noises when they're sick
Nothing to do except hold on to nothing

Oh, how does it feel to be locked inside another dream
That never had a chance of being realized?
What the fuck are you looking at?
I'll tell you what you're looking at
Everyone you ever fucking laughed at
Oh, look in my eyes for the answers typical
I can feel it underneath like a miracle
Everybody in the world needs more than
Lies and consequences to power them
Once again, it's me and no one else
I can't remember if there was a someone else
It's not mine, it's not fair, it's outta my hands
And it's shaking, you'll never take me

No one is safe
Noises, noises, people make noises
People make noises when they're sick
Nothing to do except hold on to nothing
No one is safe
Noises, noises, people make noises
People make noises when they're sick
Nothing to do except hold on to nothing

Nothing
Nothing
Oh, come on

(Hate) Hate ain't enough to describe me
(Scream) Somewhere between screaming and crying
I'm not supposed to be here
I'm not supposed to be
(Why) When do I get to know why?
(Bitter) Bitter as the stink of when I try
I'm not supposed to be here
I'm not supposed to be
No

Pull your hands away, I'm gone, goodbye, it's so depressing
Withering away, take a look inside, my soul is missing
All I have is dead, so I'll take you with me
I feel like I'm erased, so kill me just in case
I feel like I'm erased, so kill me just in case
So kill me just in case

(Covet) Everything around me's mine
(Stay) Can't see through the sties in my eyes
I'm not supposed to be here
I'm not supposed to be
(Down) Scratching and clawing all the way
(Stay) You won't let me fucking stay
I'm not supposed to be here
I'm not supposed to be
(Live) Is there another way to live?
(Die) 'Cause it's the only way to die
I'm not supposed to be here
I'm not supposed to be, come on
No, no, no
I'm not supposed to be here
I'm not supposed to be
I'm not supposed to be here
I'm not supposed to be

// My Plague //

I'm in conniptions for the final act you came here for
The one derivative you manage is the one I abhor
I need a minute to elaborate for everyone the everyday
Bullshit things that you have done

Your impossible ego fuck
Is like a megalomaniacal tab on my tongue
You fucking touch me, I will rip you apart
I'll reach in and take a bite out of that shit you call a heart

Yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't mind being ogled, ridiculed, made to feel minuscule
If you consider the source, it's kinda pitiful
The only thing you really know about me is
That's all you'll ever know

I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself

I'm turning it around like a knife on the shelf
I wanna understand why, but I'm hurting myself
I haven't seen a lotta reasons to stop it, I can't just drop it
I'm just a bastard, but at least I admit it, at least I admit it

I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself

Yeah

Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you, you
Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you, you
I can't fucking take it anymore
A snap of the synapse and now it's fucking war
Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you, you

I know why you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself
I know you blame me
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague me
I know why you plague yourself

Well, I know why you blame yourself
I know why you blame yourself
I know why you plague yourself
I know why you plague yourself

// Everything Ends //

You are wrong, fucked, and overrated
I think I'm gonna be sick, and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
I haven't slept since I woke up
And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything

Shallow skin, I can paint with pain
I mark the trails on my arms with your disdain
Every day it's the same, I love, you hate
But I guess I don't care anymore
Oh, fix my problems with the blade
While my eyes turn from blue to gray
God, the worst thing happened to me today
But I guess I don't care anymore, aah!
Fuck

You are wrong, fucked, and overrated
I think I'm gonna be sick, and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
I haven't slept since I woke up
And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything

My flaws are the only thing left that's pure
Can't really live, can't really endure
Everything I see reminds me of her
God, I wish I didn't care anymore
The more I touch, the less I feel
I'm lying to myself that it's not real
Why is everybody making such a big fucking deal?
It's never gonna pure anymore

You are wrong, fucked, and overrated
I think I'm gonna be sick, and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
I haven't slept since I woke up
And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
You're wrong and overrated
I think I'm gonna be sick, and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
I haven't slept since I woke up
And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything

Suffer!

What the hell am I doing? Is there anyone left in my life?
What the fuck was I thinking? Anybody wanna tell me I'm fine?
Where the hell am I going? Do I even need a reason to hide?
I am only betrayed, I am only conditioned to die

You are wrong, fucked, and overrated
I think I'm gonna be sick, and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
I haven't slept since I woke up
And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
You're wrong and overrated
I think I'm gonna be sick, and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
I haven't slept since I found out
My whole life was a lie
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything

You are the end of everything

// The Heretic Anthem //

Eight, seven, six, six, six
Five, four, three, two, one, zero

Yeah!

I'm a pop star threat and I'm not dead yet
Got a super dread bet with an angel drug head
Like a dead beat winner, I want to be a sinner
An idolized bang for the industry killer
A hideous man that you don't understand
Throw a suicide party and I'm guaranteed to fucking snap
It's evilsonic, it's pornoholic
Breakdowns, obscenities, it's all I wanna be

If you're 555, then I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666
Well if you're 555, I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're 555, I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?

Everybody's so infatuated
Everybody's so completely sure of what we are
Everybody defamates from miles away
But face to face, they haven't got a thing to say
I bleed for this and I bleed for you
Still you look in my face like I'm somebody new
TOY - nobody wants anything I've got
Which is fine because you're made of everything I'm NOT

If you're 555, then I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666
Well if you're 555, I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're 555, I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?

Yeah!
Heretic! Yeah!

Thirty seconds, sixteen, eight, four, let me tell you why
I haven't the slightest, I'm teaching your brightest
They're listening, clamoring
All the money in the world can't buy me
Go ahead lie to me, tell me again how you're tortured
I wanna know how you followed your orders so well
You're full of shit
You had a dream but this ain't it

If you're 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666
If you're 555, I'm 666

If you're 555, then I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're 555, then I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're 555, I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?
If you're 555, then I'm 666
What's it like to be a heretic?

Heretic!
Yeah!

// Left Behind //

I've known faces that have disappeared in time
Find me wrapped in glass and slowly soaked in lime
All my friends have pictures made to make you cry
I've seen this and wondered what I've done to calcify

I ignore you
As I close my eyes, I feel it all slipping away
I come toward you
We all got left behind, we let it all slip away
I ignore you
As I close my eyes, I feel it all slipping away
I come toward you
We all got left behind, we let it all slip away

I can't stand to see your thalidomide robot face
I don't even try it
You had to be a liar just to infiltrate me
I'm still drowning

I ignore you
As I close my eyes, I feel it all slipping away
I come toward you
We all got left behind, we let it all slip away
I ignore you
As I close my eyes, I feel it all slipping away
I come toward you
We all got left behind, we let it all slip away

Take this away
Take this away
I can feel it on my mouth
I can taste you on my fingers
I can hear you like the holy ghost
And kill you if you get too close

I ignore you
As I close my eyes, I feel it all slipping away
I come toward you
We all got left behind, we let it all slip away
I ignore you
As I close my eyes, I feel it all slipping away
I come toward you
We all got left behind, we let it all slip away

We let it all slip away
We let it all slip away
We let it all slip away
We let it all slip away
We let it all slip away
We let it all slip away

// The Shape //

Destroy
Ah!

Too tragic to stay with you
Too static to try for you
These scars, they swallow hard
The part of the past that's hollow and dark
Too horrid to kill for you
Too sordid to die with you
Unstable as always, come down
Everything else is just dust and sound

Separate, I've lost my only way
Separate, I've lost my only way
Separate, I've lost my only way
See the shape, broken and thrown away

I'd give it all away
Come take it all away
You can't resent the fear
Somebody, tell me how I got here
I'd give it all to you
Come take it, it's all for you
The noise is so damn loud, but
Everything else is just dust and sound

Separate, I've lost my only way
Separate, I've lost my only way
Separate, I've lost my only way
See the shape, broken and thrown away

I don't wanna do this anymore
Everything's shit, everything's been taken, forsaken
Gotta start it over 'cause I'm hearing it backwards
Don't make sense, don't feel better
Who's better? It's not that simple
You gotta figure it out before you make things difficult
It's not a word, it's a problem, the problem was easy
Draw your conclusions, solutions?
Everybody else wanna run?
Contorting, distorting, I am undone
One less propaganda nightmare fixture
Are you getting the picture?

Separate, I've lost my only way
Separate, I've lost my only way
Separate, I've lost my only way
See the shape, broken and thrown away
Separate, I've lost my only way
Separate, I've lost my only way
Separate, I've lost my only way
See the shape, broken and thrown away

I'm broken and thrown away
Yeah

// I Am Hated //

The whole world is my enemy, and I'm a walking target
Two times the Devil with all the significance
Dragged and raped for the love of a mob
I can't stay because I can't be stopped
Eat motherfuckers alive who cross us
I know you're all tired of the same ol' bosses
Let me tell you how it's gonna be
I'm gonna kill anyone who steps up in front of me
Welcome to the same ol' fucking scam
Same ol' shit in a dead fad
Everybody wants to be so hard
Are you real or a second-rate sports card?
They all lost their dad or their wife just died
They never got to go outside, shut up
Nobody gives a fuck
It doesn't change the fact that you suck

We are the anti-cancer
We are the only answer
Stripped down, we want you dead
But what's inside of me you'll never know
We are bipolar gods
We are, you know what we are
My life was always shit
And I don't think I need this anymore

Now I'm not pretty, and I'm not cool
But I'm fat, and I'm ugly and proud, so fuck you
Standing out is the new pretension
Streamline the sickness, half-assed aggression
You gotta see it to believe it, we all got conned
All the mediocre sacred cows we spawned
Put your trust in the mission
We will not repent, this is our religion

We are the anti-cancer
We are the only answer
Stripped down, we want you dead
But what's inside of me you'll never know
We are bipolar gods
We are, you know what we are
My life was always shit
And I don't think I need this anymore

I am hated
You are hated
We are hated
I am hated

Everything sucks, and I can prove it
Everybody dies, shuffle on, remove it
Individuals, indispensable
I'm the paradox deity vessel
The other side holds no secret
But this side is done, I don't need it
Before you go, you should know you're breaking down
You'll be rotten by the time you're underground
Fuck you

We are the anti-cancer
We are the only answer
Stripped down, we want you dead
But what's inside of me you'll never know
We are bipolar gods
We are, you know what we are
My life was always shit
And I don't think I need this anymore

We are the source of conscience
We are distorted sentients
There's only one thing left
And I can't leave until it's sated
We are the absolute
We are controlling you
They're closing in, I can't escape
I am hated

// Skin Ticket //

Zero and zero is nothing but zero
Cancer and people conspire together
Running and running and going forever
Collected and sampled, starving for zero

Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built-in migraine
Come see my cage, built-in migraine

Minus the inside and minus the circle
Inhabit the riddle and fill in the hovel
Wherein and herein, between us and near us
Zero and zero is nothing but zero

Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built in migraine
Come see my cage, built in migraine

Keeping myself alive through your empathy
Keeping myself alive through your empathy
Keeping myself alive through your empathy
Keeping myself alive through your empathy
Let me go
Keeping myself alive through your empathy
Keeping myself alive through your empathy
Keeping myself alive through your empathy
Keeping myself alive through your empathy
Leave me alone

Keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive

// New Abortion //

Yeah

I'm ethereal
My children are legion, serial
They stick to my skin like beloved cysts
I tear away with my nails and teeth and fists

Touch the hands of inverted saints
Follow my heart through the threaded pain
Callow man is a sentinel screaming
I see the future, the future is bleeding

Sores
Every goddamn minute I can feel 'em now
Like a virus, you will never kill me now
Going underground, coming on like hepatitis

We're out, and you can't reshape us
Another bug in the construct
Tearing up the main bus B
Zeros and ones are everything, execute me

Everywhere you look, it's like they know
Their fingerprints are hidden by control
This is where the line is drawn, see
You can't take my soul away from me, yeah

What do you need to see? You feel the impact?
Gotta retract, everybody get back
What is this? It's like a big conspiracy
Fields of dejected morbid progeny
They always say that it's always our fault
But everything we say is taken with a grain of salt

Man, it's always the same if we talk or complain
We only wanna upset the balance
How's it feel to be the new abortion?
The only generation to suffer extortion

Everywhere you look, it's like they know
Their fingerprints are hidden by control
This is where the line is drawn, see

You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me
You can't take my soul away from me

Everywhere you look, it's like they know
Their fingerprints are hidden by control
This is where the line is drawn, see
You can't take my soul away from me

Everywhere you look, it's like they know
Their fingerprints are hidden by control
This is where the line is drawn, see
Oh, you can't take my soul away from me

You can't take my soul away from me
Fuck you

// Metabolic //

Gone, I couldn't murder your promise
Right before my eyes
The revolutions of my psychosis
Kept me outta the way
Once inside all I hold is ash
Fail, suppressing every feeling
I'm in so much pain
I have every fucking right to hate you
I can't take it
The hardest part was knowing that I could never be you
Now all I do is sit around and wish I could forget you

My demise
I took a life worth living and made it worth a mockery
I deny, I fold, but they keep on coming
Stop!
I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Stop!
I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Stop!
I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Stop!
I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me

Who are you to me? Who am I to you?
Is this a lesson in nepotistic negligence?
By default, you are my only link to the outside
Psychosomatic suicide
Where were you when I was down?
Can you show me a way
To face every day with this face?
Goodbye

My demise, I took a life worth living and made it worth a mockery
I deny, I fold, but they keep on coming
Stop, I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Stop, I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Stop, I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Stop, I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me

Oh, when I blur my eyes, they make the whole world breathe
I see you fucking me
And I am absolutely controlling every urge to mutilate
The one and only answer so much for memories
I wanna dress in your insecurities
And be the perfect you, I'm through
I'm out-stretched out for all to loathe
Here we go, the ultimate irony
Yeah, yeah, yeah

My demise, I took a life worth living and made it worth a mockery
I deny, I fold, but they keep on coming
Stop, I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Stop, I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Stop, I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me
Stop, I'm always ready to die, but you're killing me

Stop, killing me
Stop, killing me
Stop, killing, stop, me
Killing me

"Yea!"
"Ha-ha"
"Ah..."
"Ahahah"

"Aha..."

Relax, it's over
You belong to me, I fill your mouth with dirt
Relax, it's over
You can never leave, I take your second digit with me, love

"Ah..."

You are my first
I can barely breathe, I find you fascinating
You are my favorite
Lay you down to sleep, it's all that I can do to stop, love

"Ah..."

So blue, so broken
Paper doll decays, I haven't left you yet
So cold, subversive
Your eyes are full of bleach, tomorrow I will go away again, love

"Love..."
"Ah"
"Oh, God"
"Oh, God!"

"It tears us. It makes us"
"It makes all one!"
"It tears us apart..."
"It tears us apart!"

"It cuts us, it cuts us all"

"I can't breathe"

You are mine
You will always be mine
I can tear you apart
I can recombine you
All I want is to covet you all
You belong to me
I will kill you to love you (love you)

"You fucking bitch..."

"Fuck you"
"Fucking bitch!"
"Do you see?"
"Do you see"
"Do you see!"

"It's you and I, love"
"Ah"
