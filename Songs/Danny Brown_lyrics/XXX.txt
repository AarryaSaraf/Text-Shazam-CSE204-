Album: XXX

// XXX //

30!
Colder than them grits they fed slaves
Me to rap is like water to raves
AK's with bayonets on deck
Rep my set
Sorta like Squidwird and his clarinet
I'm in ya bitch mouth
But she just fantasizing
Staring at my skinnys siad it's so tantalizing
Dog I'm strategizing plotting on throne
The masta of the ace sitting on chrome
Dark nights tryna sleep stomach on fire
Delusional from hunger so I couldn't get tired
Imaging the equalizer goin from green to red
Words that rhyme together just appear all in my head
Sorta like Neo with them Matrix codes
I try to escape it hoping drugs a numb a soul
Say I'm getting old and times running out
Repeating instrumentals tryna figure patterns out
I never leave the house ain't slept in three days
Popping pills, writing, drinking and smoking haze
Weaving the kicks and snares dodging hooks
Tryna keep it original something that's overlooked
Way a nigga goin might go out like Sam Cooke
Or locked up calling home for money on my books
Cause if this shit don't work nigga I failed at life
Turning to these drugs now these drugs turned my life
It's the downward spiral, Got me suicidal
But too scared to do it so these pills a be the rival
Surpassing all my idols
Took the wrong turn
But can't go back now so now let that blunt burn
Cause now it's my turn if I fuck it all up
Took a while to get here now I depend on these drugs
I took a while to get here now I depend on these drugs
Triple X

// Die Like A Rockstar //

[Verse 1:]
Brown bless the mic like gesundheit
Bud bout the size of a bonzai
Kick it like Muay Thai
Flow like sci-fi
In high def I'm righteous
And still bust a nut up on a bitch chest
The verbal folklore been explored and employed by none other than them fools with the gold
And them bankrolls explode
And your bitch is my target when I shoot my load
Bulls-eye my eyes tight-eyed
Fried off the same shit that rockstars died
From
Smoke something with your man bitch
Like Wyclef used to sell the cannabis
Manuscript sick shit
Prescription addiction
Sniffing adderall off the counter in my kitchen
Tripping off the shit that had Brian Wilson flipping
Experiment so much it's a miracle I'm living

[Hook:]
And I'm a die like a rockstar
Die like a rockstar
I'm a die like a rockstar
Die like a rockstar
I'm a die like a rocstar
Die like a rockstar
I'm a die like a rockstar

[Verse 2:]
Bitch I wanna party like Chris Farley
Shot of Hennessy spike that with some molly
Tell mommy I'm sorry god bless my soul
But life is so sublime going out like Brad Nowell
I got that Kurt Cobain type of mind-frame
Feeling like Keith Moon shrooms in my dressing room
Basquiat freestyle
Feeling like Jimi Hendrix and Anna-Nicole mouth
River Phoenix '93 VIP
With some drugged up porn hoes all around me
Like Teri Diver
Linda Wong all inhale having orgies
Where the horns grow along
Cause bitch I'm Frankie Lymon
Heath Ledger hyped in a jacuzzi doing that John Belushi
With Brittany Murphy we blowing hershey
I'm a die like a rockstar

// Pac Blood //

[Verse 1]
The Shakespeare of 16's, dipping my ink pen
Made a sculpture of me but my dick was too thin
Painting pictures of me but they never get my chin
One writing scriptures bringing tears to the princess
Every time I indent, you can see the intent
Leave your mind bent, hanging on the every sentence
Have no apprentice, style uninherited
Laughing at you peasants cause my penmanship is excellence
Whenever in the presence, eyes get wide
I'm the town hero cause my words give them pride
And what they feel inside, I say the perfect words for 'em
Some say I'm a prophet with the visions I get cursed for
Leave them all astonished, ride with the birds
Make a grown man cry with shrimp on the words

[Hook]
Tears to Mona Lisa, Medusa to liquid
Flow can make Gandhi grab the burner, wanna shoot shit
Rhymes that make the Pope wanna get his dick sucked
Had Virgin Mary doing lines in the pick-up
Make Sarah Palin deep-throat 'til she hiccup
Had T.D. Jakes round this bitch doing stick-ups
Rhymes so real, thought I wrote it in Pac blood
Told me in my dreams that these niggas is not thugs

[Verse 2]
What's in the portfolio? Sicker than polio
Shit so personal, my mom can't listen to
Oh so original, nigga's extra-crispy
Bars so Bukowski, Soda Popinski
Little Macs could never be number one, your time's done
Bomb filling smelling like napalm, your day's gone
Langston Hughes with a blew fuse and a screw loose
Maya Angelou abused child with her notebook
Spitting like Kipling with a tooth missing
Tongue bring torture to men, women and children
Memoir's sacred, hid in the basement
Await my next piece at a formal engagement
Crowds walk for miles just to hear that sound
Start to get more power than the ones that wear crowns

[Hook]

// Radio Song //

This is anti clean rap, nigga where the green at?
RZA take your sweat I had the balls the size of bean bags
Not what you're used to, bitch I rep the bluza
And the label fools gold, jeans with medusas
Bitches wanna scoop us, their pussy like loofahs
Y'all niggas losers cop clothes from the boosters
Hoes wanna choose up of course they gonna choose us

These stupid ass niggas wouldn't know what to do
So they copy wack niggas that's what they made you
The game's so trendy, that's why these labels fail
Cause they don't care about music, just first week sales

[Hook:]
So they say you need a hit, a chart toppin' single
That's why it's called commercial, because you need a jingle
A smash crowd banger, play it all night long
You never get on, without a radio song
So this my radio song [x2]

She wanna ride the wave, watch me do my swag surf
Party like a rockstar, never bought a makeup purse
Songs with no villains, but she feel my thang on her
Stripper with a leaky ceiling, I'm a make it rain on her
Taught me how to Dougie, I'd rather see you jerk
Skeet skeet, on the walls and her skirt
She'd rather hear a love song about what she getting
But not from Danny Brown, cause bitch I ain't tricking'
Do the pretty girl rock, and even though you ugly
Getting dirty money, but bitch I ain't above that
Ice cream paint job, send me with the...

// Lie4 //

[Hook:]
I'm balling now, yeah just like Kobe
You callin now, yea bitch you know me
You falling off, and I'm taking all yo hoes bitch
I'm showing off, what the fuck I gotta lie for

What the fuck I got to lie for [x4]

[Verse 1:]
I ain't never had shit
Zilch zero nothing
Now that a nigga got something
Yea bitch I'm stunting
Look at all this moneys
Hundreds and these fiftys
Eating at the Whitney
Now yo bitch wanna come with me
Cause we bout to go to the mall
Tonight we popping bottles
My baby momma a hoodrat
But now I got me a model
And she wanna swallow drink it all up
Straight to the neck from the bottle, bitch cause she don't need a cup
And we bout to go make it rain thunder fucking storm
Kush nuggets to the brain pop fucking corn
Shapow bitch wow been had hundreds
Naw nigga I'm just lying my nigga I be fronting
Got that income tax swag, that income tax swag
That bad dame in my lap I just cop her a bag
Got that income tax swag, that income tax swag
That bad dame in my lap I just cop her a bag

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I'm a blow it all now muthafuck a later
Bout to a mink
And sum diamond encrusted gators
Car with a TV in it, maid and a butler too
So what nigga this rented right gone have to do
I'm a take it all with me when I'm gone bitch it's gone to
Who cares when the kids get grown
They better figure out what they gone do
Cause right now nigga I got it
Nigga What about you
Broke ass niggas worth nothing

Cause a long time ago
My nigga was just like you
But we ain't talking bout the past
It's about right now my dude
Cause normally I be broke
But right now I got cash
Nah, nigga I'm lyin, you know that I be frontin
Got that income tax swag, that income tax swag
That bad dame in my lap I just cop her a bag
Got that income tax swag, that income tax swag

// I Will //

[Chorus:]
Put a cup up put a four up in it
Sixes on that chevy with some hoes in it
Put a cup up put a four up in it
Sixes on that chevy with some hoes in it
What we won't do
Bitch I will

[Verse 1:]
Take it off baby bend over let me see it
If u looking for a real pussy eater I can be it
So quit playing with me girl and bring that over here
Won't you climb aboard my face and put that pussy on my beard

I ain't tryna to take u shopping or buy yo ass some shoes
I'm just tryna lick that clit while I'm looking up at you
No shame in my game, girl, so look back at me
I don't give a fuck if it's shave or it's nappy

Long as it ain't nasty sanitation smelling
One whiff of that bitch I'm gone be bailing
If it's smelling sweet I'll lick it for a hour
And even it's sour might lick it in the shower

I go dumb and ignorant when I'm on that clitoris
Lick yo ass delirious my tongue game so damn serious
So bend that ass over lemme eat it from the back
That pussy so good have a nigga coming back

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Oh that nigga scared lemme show you what it's bout
Spread apart the lips and put that clit up in my mouth
And that thang so juicy I'm a call it jamba
Licking it in circles got me calling me yo papa
Tongue going faster singing La Labamba
Trying to keep my rhythm like the bongos in samba
I'm a pussy monster blowing on that ganja
After I finish look like you was in a sauna
Toes curling up while you grabbing on the sheets
While I'm spitting on that pussy real sloppy when I eat
Slobbing on that pussy when I'm done I do not cuddle
I put that dick up on her make her sleep in the puddle
Bitch I ain't afraid I eat it up in public
Feet on the windshield broad day fuck it
69 in hotels with the lights on
Tongue worth a million I don't need ice on
Put a cup up put a four in it
Sixes on that chevy with some hoes in it
Them hoes playing they don't wanna fuck
I'm aput they ass out they gone be walking brah
And I'm swagged up I'm off a pill
Could fuck you for an hour cause I can't feel
And I'm swagged up I'm off a pill
Could fuck you for an hour cause I can't feel

// Bruiser Brigade //

[Hook:]
Bruiser!
That's my crew
Bruiser!
But don't forget the brew
Mgds and colt 45
But don't forget the molson ice

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
I'm about to drink a Heineken
I'm about to drink a Heineken
Met a white bitch with a china friend
She gone slurp me and she gone slurp my friends
Bruiser! That's my crew
Bruiser! But don't forget the brew
MGD's and Colt 45
But don't forget the Miller High Life

We about to drink some PBR's
No bottles at the club my nigga we at the bar
UK niggas in pubs watching soccer games
Nigga we just get drunk bump waka flocka flame
Yo Bitch! She wanna fuck me
Yo Bitch! She wanna suck me
What the fuck u think she post to do?
But if she fuck me she gotta fuck the crew

[Hook]

[Ad Libs: Dopehead]
Bruiser Brigade bitch!
If you ain't pullin a nigga dick out and slapping yourself with it
Throwing this bitch in your mouth sucking dick with bubbles
Fucking all night and drinking protein shakes in the morning

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
I don't give a fuck bout none of these ho ass niggas
I don't give a fuck bout none of these hoes ass niggas
I'm drunk as fuck might fire on one of these niggas
We drunk as fuck we bout jump this nigga
Bruiser! That's my crew
Bruiser! But don't forget the brew
Drinking everything up on the shelf
Now we earling in the bathroom I need some help
But that's the life of bruiser nigga
Don't make me have to shoot a nigga
Bitch, it's bruiser brigade
Bitch, it's bruiser brigade

[Verse 3: Dopehead]
I need some brain I think I lost mine
I'm higher than Swizz Beatz hairline
You always cake up then bake up say what?
You rappers cuff and you fake as lace fronts
Dopehead hustle harder, niggas can't knock it
Super skinnies, loosies breaking in my back pocket
I slam a rapper head first like The Undertaker
Head butt your whole skull in, nigga fuck a hater
You soft as Elvin of the Cosby's
My niggas down to do a homi
Bruiser Brigade and don't forget the brew
Styling on rappers since Northwestern High School
Calling me ahead of my time is an insult
I don't need a pencil this shit is all mental
You rappers are whack, mad as hell and you bored as fuck
I hit the stage grab the mic and do my Jordan shrug

// Detroit 187 //

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
The way these bitches on my cock
You'd swear was 1985 and teen wolf just dropped
And my name was Michael J Fox
But no bitch my name is Danny Brown I got some weed up in my sock
So bitch get high with ya nigga
The sack I got looking some dead caterpillars
But it smell like a skunk that's oh so defensive
These bitches suck my dick like was moral incentive
Off the chain like broke nunchucks
Where little niggas come thru and shoot you over new chucks
A little dark like wet nubuck
Decribes my state of mind is inside the tomb of king tut
Murder all the time all we see
Detroit 187 on you niggas TV
I can first degree this beat and walk with no charges
Fuck a female MC and a Pop Artist
Ohh baby I like it raw
And My dick so big left stretch marks on her jaw
I'm so institutionalized
I wake up 6 AM because I think it's chow time
I'm a borderline porcupine
A step from drinking turpentine
Just to wash down a plate of these wack rappers rhymes
I got a mind in the cosmos
And if these niggas cold then I guess I'm osmosis
That be blowing on some potent
That them white boys be growing
While you niggas smoking smelling like some tanning lotion
My concoctions could make world ending potions
These other rap niggas got lines I got encroachments
I got endorsements so muthafucka a cosign
Punch punchlines I'll punch rappers til your broke spine
Remember back in 09
I told em it was showtime
Now they pull they cam phones out when I go for mine
Lights camera action
Hybrid be snapping
Cause the days of no tissue had to whip with wet napkins
Smear up the classifieds know it sound trife
But to be honest a metaphor my life

[Verse 2: Chip$]
Buzzin off the bar bitch you with's an amphetamine
Chase it with a 40 oz of Ready Clean
I swear I never ever smoke the better weed
Yo bitch said I'm the swaggiest nigga she ever seen
Run up in yo crib, Two K's, One Mag
Yo girl get snatched like Cool J in I'm Bad
Cost to live, you ain't made enough
Guarantee bullet holes with a laser touch
European garments drape my body if I ain't hipstered up
If she smile with eye contact then the bitch will fuck
Homie gone make me send them killers after him
Them niggas swing swords like Word Fence Champions
You was poppin' pills and drinking liquor
Now you thinkin you a gangsta killer
I leave you stankin' nigga
Laid down, face down like you taking a plankin picture
But I can keep the shots in the weapon
Put the bat to back of your leg
Grab your chin and the back of your head
And twist them shits in opposite directions

// Monopoly //

The hybrid smoking on papaya
That give you niggas bronchitis
What you write is vagina
What I write is Wall of China
Nigga that's great
Like 8ths of grape ape Stuffed in my suitcase
Ready to hit the studio and shit all on yo mixtape
Naw literally shit all on yo mixtape
Wipe with the credits leave stains on the jewel case
In just two takes then the booth is soufle'd
Your hiding something like toupee
Truthfully my friend touche
You gone get exposed like and up and coming model
And to me your label seems like one of them pagent mommas
So guess who's the lil bitch? That's you
You must suck alot of dick that's true
I misuse with issues and pistols
Mind racing like bristol heart on igloos
My nigga you ain't been what I been through
And if so you'd take a pencil to yo temple
Cause I done served fiends on they menstrual
Ain't even have pads stuffed they panties it tissue
And still hit the ave cause they mouth ain't bleeding
And yo style is like fried chicken without seasoning
Nigga that's bland fuck you and ya mans
Smack you like bitch nigga, that's openhand
Fuck you and yo tough talk
When I monopolize I'm a throw yo ass off the boardwark
Fag don't play sports but he stay at the ball park
Type of nigga u see rocking Crocs at the fucking walmart
Drunk like Stallworth, riding in a fiend car
Get flicked guess what? I'm running from this fiend car
I know a nigga dirty and got a hammer
But Kush got me high like Pac's bandanna
I'm a smart nigga that do dumb shit
In ya babymomma crib not flushing after I piss
I'm Ferris Bueller with Frank Muellers
You blank shooters on stank hooters
I'm in aruba sippin wine coolers
Mind ruler flow sort of like hypnotism
That's why all these white bitches wanna get with em
I smack me up flip em like Mik Bivens
And to me your flows like Ronny Devoe's
My hoes got pretty toes in expensive high heels
And your hoes toes is fucked in beauty supply sandals
I'm a vandal handling any situation
I smoke blunts to the face to stay motivated
Irratated when I'm not sedated
I fuck her face like I was obligated
And still fucking with them freak hoes
Stank pussy smelling like Cooler Ranch Doritoes

// Blunt After Blunt //

[Verse 1]
Kush got a nigga feeling awesome
Ate that bitch pussy 'til she squirted like a dolphin
Told her bend over, hit that shit doggy
Called her a cab then I told that bitch to call me
Danny Brown bitch, tell me what you need
I got some Adderall and fire ass weed
And they try to tell me I get too high
That's a lie if so bitch I woulda been died
But the flow OD, don't get cochesed, capiche?
Fuck with me, fuck around and be deceased
Rest in peace wack niggas with your oversized clothes
Complain about my jeans cause I'm taking all they hoes
Hold up, wait a minute
Your pussy ain't shit 'til you had some Danny in it
I'm gone off a Zanny nodding off watching menace
Rolling on some purple that my nigga call Grimmace
Bitch I ain't finish
These bars was test tubed in the lab with foreign chemist
Rolling testers on it but statistics got slumped
I'm smoking blunt after blunt

[Hook]
And I smoke
Blunt after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt, after blunt

[Verse 2]
'til my brain feels ten pounds heavier
You fell off like Tom Selleck in a Celica
Bitch give me brain for the hell of it
But to her it's heaven if she even gets a smell of it
That's why these bitches fuck with me
Cause I eat that pussy like a female MC
You get it? How about me and your girlfriend, you with it?
Money over everything the only thing that matter
And since I been getting it my been blunts getting fatter
Take a couple puffs off it now a nigga woozy
The white hoes I fuck with consider them whooties
We 'bout to make a movie, starring me and a cast full of groupies
And I do my own stunts, I'm smoking blunt after blunt

[Hook]

// Outer Space //

It's the Adderall Admiral, Writing holy macarel
Your bitch say my dick long like the strap on a satchel
I took me a capsule with no hassle
Now it's like I dip feathers of ink in a castle
A prodigy like bullets hit your left clavicle
No sweatsuits and paint the avenue
You have no clue like toy stores with no board games
But when I paint pictures I'm dipping brushes in war paint
I'm a motherfucking mother fucker
Fucking on your mother with two rubbers, I do fucker
No cover just her booty on a pillow
Your bitch said my dick tastes like Tropical Fruit Skittles
I'm bumping BO Wither, Swishers on Schwarzenegger
Matter fact, nah nigga they on Boa Constrictors
They'll choke a nigga
These niggas ain't rappers they motherfucking characters
Caught your baby momma horny then I stuck a carrot in her
Then you made a salad with her, ate that shit for dinner
I don't want that skinny bitch look like that ho from Thinner
Swore she played soccer she was real good with headers
Had me yelling "Goal!" while I was sitting on the dresser
Give the bitch a hat trick, smoking on the cat piss
I keep the bitch wet, around you she's a cactus
I got them Penis Psalms for your Vagina Monologues
Love a feminist bitch, oh, they get my dick hard
So no apologies for all the misogyny
I just want some company to come and watch some porn with me
My oral orchestration causes manipulation
The way these hoes be chasin though I had the tongue of Satan
But I just gave em dick they more for conversation
Why you niggas tricking giving your obligation
You safe havens, I'm Wes Craven with Ex cravings
Fuck a bitch mouth until her fucking face cave in
Hidden cams in her house, I caught her masturbating
Extorted her for the cash, now yo ass payin
You Captin Save-Em-Ass Nigga
I don't give a bitch shit but hard dick and liquor
So nice to meet you, I hope that you're safe
(Meet the future face to face)

// Adderall Admiral //

[Verse 1:]
Eating on an Adderall, wash it down with alcohol

Writing holy mackarel, actual all factual
Out for the capital, matador ya capsules
Hassle the bitch in a castle with the ill grapples
Tackled her asshole, my dick was like a lasso
Fucked her in her mouth she washed it down with Tabasco

[Verse 2:]
You softer than Flanders' son
Don't make me put hands on son
Jump niggas like "Fuck one on one."
Used to be locked up watching One on One
Young Kyla Pratt was looking thick, nigga wanted some
But soon as I got out white bitches by the tons

[Verse 3:]
I fuck bad bitches to Stacy Lattisaw
While you niggas got blue balls like a Avatar
Eating caviar in El Salvador
She running from my dick like it's a bull and she the matador
She a pregnant labrador
Said my metaphors are the highest caliber

[Verse 4:]
I spit hard, you hallmark card poets
So many lines, you can bar code it
She like to lick it on the head while she slow stroke it
Ocean in her panties and I'm 'bout to float through it
Rewind this and just smoke to it

// DNA //

[Hook: Danny Brown]
It's in my, D.N.A
Cause my pops like to get fucked up the same way
It's in my, D.N.A
Cause my moms like to get fucked up the same way

D.N.A., D.N.A
Cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way
D.N.A., D.N.A
Cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way

[Verse 1:]
Waking up, drooling on Versace pillowcases
And I'm smoking eight a day, I might end up a mental patient
Terrycloth bathrobes, blunts and ashtrays
White wine in flute glass, early morning Saturdays
Food plates and grade A, crepes and OJ
Bitches swimming topless in Chlorine off morphine
Emails on iPads don't answer when phone rings
Text message full coming down on four beans
Every night like a bachelor party in Sin City
Bitches sniffing coke off each other titties with rolled 50s
Life I live like Charlie Sheen and Rick James
Goin' hard until it ain't a dollar to my name
This that triple X shit nigga how ya feel
Groupies like glam rock poison logo pills
Sniffing mali off amps with blond haired tramps
When I'm on my way to the stage every night I rage

[Hook:]
It's in my, D.N.A
Cause my pops like to get fucked up the same way
It's in my, D.N.A
Cause my moms like to get fucked up the same way

D.N.A., D.N.A
Cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way
D.N.A., D.N.A
Cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way

[Verse 2:]
Warhols all on the wall of the villa
Adderall popping got me jumping to ceiling
Perceived as a villain no sentiment in my sentence
For instance in instants they'll be calling forensics
If incidents occur remember these ain't just words
Go from talking shit to organs preserved
You soft serve rappers just hide behind your reverb
And even with effects you'll just end you dessert
I research and homework, make you dig ya own dirt
On beats buried alive, ratting wiseguys
I'm with a Latin bitch fat ass and well proportioned thighs
And love to see it cumming so I squirt it in her eyes
I'm hopping out that new shit like narcs on Tuesday
The grill on it shiny like LL Cool J's
What's on my waist could make a nigga meet his doomsday
To describe your mixtape that shit was like a toothache

[Hook:]
It's in my, D.N.A
Cause my pops like to get fucked up the same way
It's in my, D.N.A
Cause my moms like to get fucked up the same way

D.N.A., D.N.A
Cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way
D.N.A., D.N.A
Cause my fam like to get fucked up the same way

// Nosebleeds //

Business comes from...
Got probation cause the parents paid the money,
Six months rehab, but she's back at it,
Reflexion stare at it, but she can't look at it!
She whipped out the...
The stupid loans, they call her phone, but she don't sweat it!
Cocaine no... separate in lines,
Every time she do it, she says it's her last time.
Chasing out high from the very first time,
But getting... in 2009
Never thought this relationship would come this far,
...in her nose, I'm blade sniffing hard!
In night clubs... her friends sniff it hard
Never sleep in random dude's apartments...
I'm replying texts from her boyfriend,
Feeling like any second the world can end,
And when... and make her pussy wet,
Face washing going numb, nipple hard on them breasts
Sniffing 'till it tripped, back... blood running down her lips!

// Party All The Time //

[Verse 1:]
Always wanna go
Always tell her yes, Never tell her no
I know you think you know everything but don't
Really wanna do the right thing but won't
So you chase the nightlife blinded by the lights
The bottom of a empty glass is where she find life
Always left behind cause she think she always right
Thinking that she grown she don't need your advice
But always in situation that she needs your help
But wouldn't help another only care her about herself
In ya vip asking where the drink at
Calling her a groupie you'd think she'd really think that
She just wanna hear that that ass look right
What you doing after this fuck tomorrow night
Wanna snort blow? Pop a lotta pills?
Fucking when the sun come up but don't feel

[Hook: x2]
She want to party all the time, party all the time
She want to party all the time, She want to party all the time
Party all the time, She want to party all the time

[Verse 2:]
Skip semester, class is a past
Say she goin back but she ain't goin back
Cause time ain't waiting for a future on hold
At glass tables on her knees sniffing coke
Tell her get a hold, grip on life
Rather fill her cup up liquor with no ice
Twice had an abortion
Young, dumb misfortune
Rate that going she might be whoring
Signs she ignoring but doesn't recognize
Blind to what's occuring what's goin on in ya mind
Seven days a week same shit every morning
Calling her a cab from different niggas apartment
Wanting her to change but she won't, dog
Just another number in her fucking call log
Lost in the fog, head in the smoke
Laughing at the world cause her life is a joke

[Hook x2]

// EWNESW //

[Verse 1]
I was born one day before Saint Pat
I guess a nigga miss luck just like that
Henry Ford, not even one mile from Motown
Explains all the soul that you hear in my sound
A ten minute ride to Linwood, I begun
My mama first son, look what I just become
A weedhead with words more potent than what I'm smoking
This ain't no Reggie caught the plane ride from Oakland
I used to play with pistols in crackhouses
Skiping school just to fuck bitches on dirty couches, abandoned houses
Find one with the lights on it
Landlord came pulled the hook and locks on it
Money I'm plotting on it I put the block on it
I'm gonna get it, four deep, no shocks on it
We sit low, rep the D cause it's all I know
And my name rings bells in any hood you go

[Hook]
You're from the East Side
You're from the West Side
You're from the North End
Are you from South West

[Verse 2]
Around first grade, we move to the East Side
Was like throwing rocks at a beehive
A lot of niggas gone over something unimportant
That it ain't worth mentioning cause it's unfortunate
Like stick a fork in it, where's the enforcement?
Walking off the grass just to sit on niggas porches
Passing round 40's, brown paper bags
Rolling up a swisher while this rat freak a black
It ain't about nothing, but let me hold something
Ate a lunchable for dinner, nigga I'm ain't fronting
Caught the bus to East land, just to walk around it
Ain't buy nothing nigga, just walked around it
Looked at some hoes, I ain't even holler
Cause I'm broke as fuck and they is all about a dollar
I'm living in the city where the weak get swallowed
Belly of the beast, we don't care about tomorrow
I'm living in the city where the weak get swallowed
Belly of the beast, we don't care about tomorrow

[Hook]

// Fields //

[Verse 1:]
When money talk only broke people listen
Ain't gotta pot to piss in can't afford to pay attention
These unfamiliar niggas be expecting recognition
Respect the intellect let me continue on the mission
Use to walk through alleys paths in the field
You know that one house where Kenneth use to live
Now it's just another shortcut to the store
The tv and my window drew the line of what was rich and poor
Mommy gave me food stamps told me buy wonder bread
On the way these niggas jumped left me with knot on my head
Went to school yesterday but to had leave early
Cause niggas said they was gone jump me at 3: 30
All because I lived in the hood who they had beef with
And I ain't tell em, dog, I kept that shit a secret
But I can't really trip, niggas looked out for me
Nigga played me now that nigga ain't around to tell the story
Just young nigga on the D.O.T
With my headphones on and sack full of weed
Rhymes in my head thought nobody wanted to hear em
So I had the fiends hitting rocks like the Pilgrims

[Hook: x2]
And where I live it's house, field, field
Field field, field, house
Abandoned house, field, field

[Verse 2:]
That nigga much sicker
That's why he pop them pills, sip lean, smoke swishers
Yea I'm doing drugs thought I never ever try
That had eyes so dry dog I wish I could cry
I'm fucking bad foreign bitches why you niggas in the hood
Smoking on some dirt weed smelling like fire wood
Sitting on porches of abandoned houses
Or sitting in the field on bed bug ridden couches
It's like they all forgot man nobody care about us
That why we all ways end up in prison instead of college
Living in the system working kitchen for chump change
Lost in the streets niggas playing that gun game
Where nobody wins just a bunch of mommas losing
Dead bodys in the field and nobody heard the shooting
We living in the streets where the options is limited
Cause it's burnt building instead of jobs and buisseness

[Hook]

// Scrap Or Die //

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
We been lookin at the house for a bout a whole
A family live there got put out last month
My uncle sniffing blow while I'm rolling up a blunt
His homey in the basment smoking crack with his aunt
And tonights that night we bout to get right
Piled up in a van with a couple flashlights
This metal crowbars gonna get us through the door
We come to take everything fuck the landlord
So now we at the place skullys on bareface
Bout to leave this bitch bare and strip the whole place
My unc took outside he ripping down the gutters
So we inside tearing up this motherfucker
Bust open the walls just to get the wiring
Took the hot water tank and left over appliances
Aluminum siding and had to come back
Cause the furnace so big it wouldn't fit in the back

[Hook:]
Now it's copper bout by the pound
Wire by the inch
Got a check on the first
And it's gone by the 5th
Scrap or Die Nigga
And you might be laughing at it cause you know the shit is true
Rusty flat bed truck the color as doo-dooo
Scrap or Die Nigga

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Early morning next day at the junkyard
Got four loads bout to get broke off
But these niggas slick I sweat I'm going off
Put the work on the scale and I swear that bitch was off
Cause I know we had way more than at
Fuck it, split it up ay I get more than at
These niggas always slick on that bullshit
Cheat you out a couple bucks on some dope fiend shit
Now we back in the hood plot the next lick
Got a school closed down and I think we should hit it
Just waiting on my unc to get back from the clinic
And we gone go over there and see what's up with it
Now we up in it taking old computers
Until we fucking heard "Don't move or I shoot ya."
Fucked up hook caught us tryna cash in
Now we gotta B&E case and trespassing

[Hook]

// 30 //

Sent ya bitch a dick pic and now she need glasses
Turn a bitch slick rick now if I flashed it
Ate a couple pills took the bud out the plastic
Flicking cigarette ashes bitch I stay blasted
Microphone Cassius
Magic with the sick shit
Said I post to been dead
But bitch I'm still up in this bitch
Verbal herbal poison
Words I cortisone
Fucked pregnant bitch
Save money on her abortion
I feel like Billy Corgan
In a church playing the organ
Covering too short
Smoking a Newport
Hurt hoping drugs a help the pain a go away
And all these thoughts in my head made the sane go astray
Step inside a mind
That revolves around the rhyme
And he close his eyes see visions of white lines
Dying in the arms of a blond blue eyed 20 something
Don't know her name now the paramedics chest pu
30 something black male OD'ed off pills that he wasn't prescribed
But they took his life
Let behind a daughter that doesn't really even know him
Because her momma thought he wouldn't make a living off them poems
But it was a long journey on a rocky road
Had a hoody and a jacket on the bus in snow
Walking in the cold on the way to the studio
Smoking on a loosey that was just a couple yrs ago
Dropped a couple free mixtapes on the net
And niggas tried to front like it wasn't all that
But guess what bitch I'm coming back
Guess what bitch I'm coming back
Signed to fools gold and everything's all gnarly
Bitches want my number just to get up in party
Came along way from extension cords in the window
Borrowing neighbors power just to plug up the Nintendo
Where the ovens never closed and stoves never off
Every winter so cold niggas sleeping scarves
But I would always tell myself that this shit of get better
You know who you is you the greatest rapper ever
So now the pressures on em to prove that voice right
Some people never know they goals he know his whole life
So now his turn up fixing up to bat
Pitching singles to the label when I use to pitch crack
Never learned to rap I just always knew how
So ever since 8 I knew what I would now
When I turned 28 they like what u gone do now
And now a nigga 30 I don't u heard me
So the last ten years I been so fucking stressed
Tears in my eyes let me get this off my chest
The thought of no success it got me chasing death
Doing all these drugs in hopes of OD'ing next
Triple X

[Verse 1:]
Ho, the only thing you gotta know
My dick touch the ground when I'm sitting on the floor
You think I'm gonna fall off?
I got advice for ya holmes
Fall asleep in your car
In your garage with the engine on
I'm playing ping pong with your bitch jaw
You the type to have a sing-along in Superman drawls
I got a red head ho
I call her Molly Ringwald
She like to take a lot of Molly
And bring Adderall
Sipping white wine 'til the sunset
Before it got dark she already got naked
Necked her for a second
Then she got reckless
Rump shaker, wrecks and FX'd it
Bum stickity bum stickity bum Das EFX'ed it
Left her bum sticky
Fell asleep on the terrace
Me on the beat, that's a hate crime
With black ink, I murder white lines
Baseline

[Verse 2:]
What's with all the ho shit?
Your flow's atrocious
The amount of weed I smoke is copious
Eyes red like Soviet
Dog, you're on some bogus shit
These novice poets are not my associates
Ferocious; but the flows inappropriate
But if you approach this they might call encroachment
I'm so bent, oh shit
Got your bitch soakin'
I ain't Clarence Carter
But bitch I be Strokin'
Ho, are you outta your mind?
I tell a bitch like this
"You are not that fine"
I don't give a bitch shit
No, not a dime
But bitch, for you
I ain't even got time
The sunshine in the thunder storm
Catching clouds smelling like the green giant underarm
I can never cop her holmes
I just give her Sutter Homes
Nut all on her butt
Wipe it up, then I send her home
Baseline

// Witit //

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Fuck all night when I'm on that E, shoulda popped 2 but tonight popped 3
Roll so hard can't feel my knees, 5 in the morning ain't think about sleep
Smoking on that papaya, got a white bitch looks like Mariah
Bet I make her hit that high note when I put this dick up inside her
My outerwear be Moncler, Bonjour, out there
Insane with Balmain, bitch these jeans about a stack a pair
Got henny stains on Givenchy, bitch don't even tempt me
I will take you to my office, make you give me that Lewinsky
Ball so hard when I'm on them 'ralls
Bitch so freaky suck a dick through the drawers
Halls in her mouth just to hum on the balls
After this night whore I won't even call
Up so high I ain't never gone fall
Pissin on niggas got careers in the stall
Shittin on niggas, leaving streaks in your drawers
Take your top off like a toilet when it's clogged

[Bridge]
They say I'm a menace I meant it, I meant it
Be more than just a minute
This dick touch your appendix
I said that I'mma do it
So guess what bitch I did
These hoes know that I've done it
So now these bitches wit' it
She wit' it I'm wit' it
She wit' it I'm wit' it
She wit' it I'm wit' it

[Hook]
She rubbin' all on them titties like my name was Biggie
But I don't know no Diddy
I got that Dirty Money with me
Got some Bobby and that Whitney
For Christina and Brittney
She sippy then she get tipsy
Then she drop it low and get get it
She wit' it I'm wit' it
She wit' it I'm wit' it
She wit' it I'm wit' it

[Verse 2]
I go stupid, I be fooling
Bitch you see me, ho start drooling
Bitch you thirsty, acting foolish
Eazy on the E cause Iâm ruthless
Nigga with an attitude when I ain't zooted
Roll a whole box up, letâs get clueless
You wanna eat her while I fuck you?
Waka waka, oh lets do it
Hard in the paint, think I ainât?
Double cup love pouring up drank
Dirty cream soda, Swishers and doja
Dipping that molly gotta nigga tore up
Give yo monkey this banana
I make the camel toe trample
Got you dripping, wetting that bed up
When that pussy getting dismantled
Iâm suckin all on them titties
You playing wit this dick
You put them legs up on my shoulders
Iâm spittin all on that clit
She say âOh, you so nastyâ
âOh Danny, you so nastyâ
Iâm slapping on that booty
Left my hand print on ya ass cheek

[Hook]
They say I'mma menace

// Shouldn't Of //

[Verse 1:]
Drunk as fuck, high as shit, bitch suck my dick
You ain't never seen a long dick
I said a long dick
I said a long dick, bitch
You gone learn today, you gone learn today
Pull it out and spray all on ya lingerie
Call it a cum grenade, rub it on yo tummy
(Shoulda never gave ya black ass some money!)
Now I'm stomping all on yo couches
Standing all on yo tables
Ripping open yo bitch blouses
Got my toungue all up in her navel
The baddest mufucka 'round
Hold my drink bitch
I said bitch I'm Danny Brown
Lemme get on my pimp shit
I'm sniffing Adderall off yo china
Shoes on in yo living room
Got my elbows on ya table
Left Swisher guts in yo dining room
I'm all up in yo kitchen
Lips on the orange juice bottle
I done popped me an ecstasy pill
So you know I'm tryna get higher
Shouldn't of gave this nigga nothing
Shouldn't of gave my black ass nothing, dog
Remember when I was struggling?
Caught the bus cause I was hustling
Used to stack up to go to Hudsons
Hid the work from my older cousin
Hit my shit like it wasn't nothing
Knew I wouldn't fight him so said fuck it

[Hook:]
My pockets on dummy
They say I'm acting funny
Shouldn't of never gave my ass no money

[Verse 2:]
Now I'm blowing on the best kush
Shit be fucking my lungs up
2 packs of Newports a day
And I used to just buy loosies tho
Hoes all on my dick
Them hoes ain't wanna fuck before
But still I fucked them bitches
But I just never call no more
I'm all up in yo liquor cabinet
Drinking whatever up in the bitch
Took too many pills
Now I'm throwing up in yo toilet
I'm like aww shit
I'm in the house of hip hop
With my motherfuckin feet on the table
Ran the phone bill up on the phone sex line
And I even ordered porn on the cable
Give a nigga from my hood a thousand
He'll treat it like a 100 thousand, nigga
Public assistance housing
Mice all up in yo closet
Keeping it G ain't bout where you from
It's about where you gone be
'Cause ain't shit sweet when you living on the street
And there's roaches crawling on your cheek

[Hook]
