Album: Old

// Side A (Old) //

[Verse 1:]
In the kitchen, oven open for the heat
Got my young, light skinned ho rollin' up the tree
Wearin' jackets in the house, it's the Michigan way
Boiling water on the stove, Ramen noodles for dinner
Dope fiends out the halfway house and they still sniffin'
Homie mommy's 50, smokin' and still trippin'
Still talkin' shit with this Lucio mask lickin'
See my breath when I talk, but nigga, I ain't trippin'
Landlord is, the nigga tryna put us out
Sellin' all the samples, can't afford to give 'em out
Just copped a half tre, see my nigga tryna get it
Standin' on the baseline, Scottie Pippen pivot
Needles in they arms just to keep the lights on
Shit, fuck around, be on hardcore pawn
Tryna get this shit off, the winter, we snuck in
Won't live for anything, but might die for nothin'

[Hook: x2]
They want that old Danny Brown
To bag up and sell a whole pound
Might have to go and get my braids back
Matter of fact, go and bring them AKs back

[Verse 2:]
In the Cutty same color as steak sauce
Eyeballed the work, but was just a.8 off
Vet in the game, first seed in the playoffs
Meet me at the Coney, gotta get this weight off
Balmains fittin' like a nigga went swimmin' in 'em
I'm waxed and I'm shinin', hardwood floor
Whore want it hardcore, squirt it on her jaw
Lookin' at the whore like "what you came here for?"
Linwood nigga, heat on him, no stash box
Turn a gangbanger's bandana to a rag top
Old head, dope fiend, cookin' up the yay
Young boys'll shoot your face for them Cartiers
Came a long way takin' $3 for a nick'
Cop an 8 ball, tryna stack for the zip
Now I'm in the rap game, verse worth a brick
Fiends linin' up for a hit of this shit
(And I reps that shit, right now and forever) [x2]

[Hook]

// The Return //

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
See they think I'm a fuck nigga
But if they ever see me then they might have to duck, nigga
Like what, nigga? Before your ass can answer, get your whole shit bust, nigga
Them rolls off them ashes, drinking Fiji water
Wanna pull me in that fire when I'm trynna feed my daughter
Wanna snatch my mommas plate, and tell her she can't eat
And we gone have us some discrepancies right here in this grief
Because the weak don't speak, get left in silence
And when you don't listen, gotta speak with violence
And duct tape the grandmama, strip a man of all his honor
Out here tryna be a G, now you wish you a goner
I walk with the Gods with the tounges for the devil
Tryna keep a nigga thirsty so for rain I pray mercy

[Hook: Danny Brown]
The return of the gangsta cause niggas don't believe
I roll hotter than my sleeve, leave a nigga in the street
The return of the gangster cause niggas got deals
This rap shit don't work then it's back to selling krills
Return of the gangster cause niggas want that real
Want that old Danny Brown but nigga I'm like chill
Return of the gangster fucked that hipster squeeze the trigger
You got me fucked up I'm a hood ass nigga

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Eastside niggas keep roaches in the ash tray
Twenty thousand out the public housing on a bad day
Dropped it in the chronic finna lock it that's some bad yay
Tryna save my soul I wish the lord would meet me half way
Devil on my shoulder as I'm whipping up this yola
And them motor minnesota
Only option is a shoot out if the police pull me over
This shit get real as shit that's on your Playstation controller
Call of Duty ass nigga
Dick in the booty ass nigga
Don't po' up

// 25 Bucks //

[Break:]
25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights nigga that's how we was living

[Hook - Megan James:]
I'll not get old
If I dig with my knees, if I grind on my teeth
I know from the attic of me
From the bottoms of cleats, from the wayward it seeds

[Verse 1:]
Arthritis in her fingers, carpal tunnel in her wrists
'Bout to feed her kids at night sit between her legs and twist
While she listen to the oldie soap operas smoking bogies
On the phone gossiping telling homegirls stories
Girlfriend worried cause her son's in a hurry
To see the state Pen' or a cemetery buried
Ma replied do her best but it's still rough
Keep your kids out the street and away from drugs
Doing hair in the house ain't putting on Daniel
Daddy in and out, ay, who turned that channel?
Sneakers turn to house shoes, stepping on the back
Ashing her cigarette in a brown paper bag
Smoking joints, lauging tryna get the part straight
For ten, put your perm in, don't scratch all day
Hot cocoa stove put the food in the bowl
Say that's how many nights it was hard to keep going

[Bridge:]
Now I'm trapped in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting
Wanna see me dead or locked in a prison
In the system with division only thing that add up
Fucked up cause a nigga tryna get a couple bucks

[Break + Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Iverson zig zags, good night fast food
If you really balling, mommy cop Chinese food
If you really wonder why these people got issues
Cause the rent owed and the fucking lights due
On her knees at night, pray a miracle come through
Daddy shooting Craps, tryna win a pair of shoes
I been growing my hair 'bout to let mommy twist it
Out wilding with my friends even got myself a biscuit
Homie momma smoking with nothing to lose
Now he stashing cracks in some hundred dollar shoes
Sitting at his crib, smoking Swishers, getting faded
Told me hit my mommy up, cause he tryna get braided
What we gon' do see the local dope man
See if we can put some money in our hand
Same one jump me, the same one front me
Cause I'm tired of seeing my family fucked up and hungry

[Bridge:]
Now I'm trapped in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting
Wanna see a nigga dead or locked in a prison
In the system with division only thing that add up
Fucked up cause a nigga tryna get a couple bucks

[Break]

// Wonderbread //

[Hook: Danny Brown]
On my way to get Wonderbread
I swear I just want the bread

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Mommy gave me a book of food stamps
Said go get some bread and a pop and come back
Walk out the door first thing I see
A dope fiend standing there looking at me
Standing right there in front of the porch
With a pipe in his hand and the other a torch
I kept on moving ain't worried bout that
But a block later heard "rat-tat-tat-tat"
Next, some niggas from over there shootin'
Dog I ain't blinked just kept it a-movin'
Block later up: What do I find?
A junkie ho, I laughed at her cryin'
Flaggin' up cars, gettin' her bread
Guess what I seen on the way to get bread

[Hook x4: Danny Brown]

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Mommy gave me a book of food stamps
To go get some bread and a pop and come back
Get to the store, first thing I see
An Arab dude just starin' at me
Lookin' at me like I'm bout to steal
But really though dog, you need to go chill
Grabbed what I needed, left out the do'
Two little boys in front of the sto'
Fiends runnin' up, runnin' through alleys
I kept on movin' nobody looked at me
Course some niggas stomped on my head
All because they wanted the bread

[Hook x3: Danny Brown]

// Gremlins //

I know some lil' niggas that thirst cream
That pop a bitch on camera and we ain't talkin' bout twerk team
Shootin' up cribs turnin' porches to smokescreens
Mama smoking nightmares chasin' her pipe dream
Hard to give advice behind the mind of the call
So his limits have ceilings cause his pop behind walls
School become a free meal
Tree become a cheap thrill
Same prices pa paid he gon' pay a cheap deal
Hourglasss empty but he lookin' for a refill
Revolver breakdancin, yeah he make that bitch windmill
Guess he's just a psycho in the city in the Chrysler
Everybody livin' spiteful nigga lookin' just to ice you
So we livin' hostile just to cop some Aeropostale
Trenchcoat Mafia, for a lil' Hollister
Gotta get his dollas up
So we hit the dice game
Lost all his re-up, now he rob the dice game
Probation violation call his ass the son of Satan
Got these old niggas scared like it's crystal lake and Jason
Cause they been through cases they ain't tryna go back
Fresh meat up on the street he give a fuck about that
Snatchin' Carti's downtown wear 'em same damn week
Tryna get the same bitches on the same damn street
Rob a ho ass nigga at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
Cause they gremlins

Gremlin

He just wanna smoke some kush
And fuck with some hoes at the mall
For that shit, he wished it all
Baby face and all, my lil' nigga gotta ball, lil' nigga gotta ball
Run up on you where that money at
Fuck nigga after that
Lean in that double cup
Lil nigga screwed up
Pop a pill nigga
And he don' feel nigga
You do it in the song, he do it for real nigga
And all his OGs is either dead or in prison
Scared to talk to him like, fuck it they won't listen
Unnecessary shit, thinkin' that he has to
A pair of True Religions dog, my lil nigga blast you
Listenin' to 2 Chainz, ain't thinkin' bout college
I wonder if he knew that 2 Chainz went to college
I wonder if he knew that, would that change his mind?
Guess that's somethin' we'll find in due time

// Dope Fiend Rental //

Trail of blood on that baggie
I done scraped myself with that razor
Gettin head in that trick house and I snuck out without payin her
Locked up in that precinct used my Timberland for a pillow
Break the dank in that swizzle ridin round in a dope fiend rental
Pulling up on ya baby mama like bitch what you tryna get into
If you ain't about that suckin, then ho you can keep on trucking
I'm gettin mine straight up no middle man nigga I don't like you
Fool's Gold the clique and musically we don't fuck with you
Went from holdin crack in my ass crack
To racks on racks on ASCAP
Coulda rhymed ASCAP with ass capped
Jadakiss already said that
Do it for the days when for dinner
All a nigga had to eat was a couple of coneys
Broke as fuck and no bitch to fuck
In my basement jackin' off lonely
Used to fall off fuckin' with the work
But guess what? I'm back on ho
No more [?] on that couch
Now I'm all the way in your bitch mouth
And I gag her till she cry
On her stomach fluid come up
I be fuckin' her face on the daily
You be kissin' that bitch in the mouth

[Hook]
Like open wide ho!
Open wide ho!
Open wide ho!
Open wide ho!

[ScHoolboy Q]
If I tell a bitch to do a flip in the air
Then land on my dick from the back
Look I ain't trippin, no, I ain't kiddin'
Have her lickin' my head like a cat
Now shut up bitch and get the Amber Rose
Come and let a young real nigga cut
But nah bitch this dick ain't free
So she copped my dick and then cuffed
Now come here chick and let me feed you nuts
Cum on her ass and have her lyin' in it
How her mouth can be wide as her legs
My dick is long as the Brooklyn bridge
Hit it raw cause I'm with the shit
Gave her the pipe said she need a fix
Gave you life, can't believe the sight
Take the wood like a termite
Made a crash up at the turnpike
But it's a rental I'll get another
Wonder if you got the gift from your mother
I used to play hoops with your brother
Even played a lil house with your sister
She always call me daddy or mister mister
Why the [?] shirts can do more than fist her
Bitch gettin' head, I ain't never kissed her
B I G never missed a beat
I was [?] so I skeet skeet
Ho can make an orgasm last a week
I'mma get her deep, she a masterpiece
Hell no I don't love that bitch
Hell yeah I'm gon' enjoy that bitch
But I hope my daughter don't be like this
But I know her mama know that shit exist

[Hook]

// Torture //

[Verse 1:]
Remember one time, dawg
This fiend owed the boss
Put Peanut Butter on her pussy
Let his pits lick it off
Back when I was living on Flanders
Seen another dope fiend beat another with a hammer
Remember at the park, seen a nigga at a payphone.
Got rocked in his dome
Momma picked me up and ran home
Was like fucking seven years old
When I first seen a fiend try to light a rock off the stove
Damn near burned his top lip off
So my mind ticked off
Desensitized to a lotta things
Mind would drift off
Wish it was what I seen on tv
I snapped outta that
Unc beating on my auntie.
Gunshots outside
Was sorta like fireworks
We know they gained fireworks
It's december 21'st
Cold winter with a kerosene heater
On the couch so cold, can't take off your sneakers

[Hook:]
And it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen
Nigga, it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrors
All the shit that I've seen
Nigga, it's torture
Look in my mind and see the horrorss
All the shit that I've seen

[Verse 2:]
I feel like a prisoner of war
Reacting sporadically to what the mind absorb
Probably need a shrink
Can't get a wink
So I smoke a lot of kush and pop a Xanax to sleep
Close my eyes, look up, fiend said 1 for 8
Can tell that I scared him by the look on my face
Reached in my pocket served him nervous as a surgeon
Can't believe where I'm at 'pose be writin' verses
Heard a knock at the do'
'Nother fiend wanted fo'
Gave him what he came for
Told him go to the sto'
Lemme get a box a box of Swishers, Faygo Cola
Gave his ass another stone now guess what it's over
He ain't come back
Before I could look back
I heard the wood on the door crack
And they yelling police
With this work up in my jeans man this a bad dream

[Hook]

// Lonely //

[Intro:]
HÃ© bien peut-Ãªtre l'oiseau
L'oiseau qui dormait en chacun de nous
S'Ã©lÃ¨vera

[Verse 1:]
Hipster by heart but I can tell you how the streets feel
Everybody thirsty and they looking for a refill
If the gang eat you guns barking at your doggie bag
Get took out for your take out now you carry out
Murder by delivery, married at the paramount
I just coughed up a fair amount
Of niggas might air it out
Judge a book by cover so we never educated
It ain't about racists poor and rich segregated
Just to get the bacon dawg, you gotta go HAM
Use to be lost til I found who I am
But it took the hook to eat the palm on my hands
Locked tryna get real creative with the spam
Locked in a jam cause a nigga serve butter
Just to get a little bread had to keep tomato smothered
All I really wanted was to overdub my vocals
But no one ever thought that I would take it past local
High a'top a totem man somebody shoulda' told 'em
That if money grow on trees being rich is dime a dozen

[Hook:]
So I'm smoking by my lonely
By my goddamn self
I don't need your help homie
Cause don't nobody really know me
Said nobody really know me

[Verse 2:]
See that's going on a limb
And I used to sell trees, and I used to rock Timbs
Radiohead shit, fiends with The Bends
Back when Granny used to tell me "Stay Out of In"
Blaming cold air out, tryna know my whereabouts
Gone for three days and nobody ever heard about
How I got these Jordans, but that ain't too important
When I got a bitch pregnant and I'm stacking for abortion
And all I really wanted was to give myself a portion
Lit up off the Henney got a nigga self absorbing
Smoking on a bogie, no bud style, who can I trust now?
Lady snitch and got the whole block down
Now we gon' eat now, no rebound, when your boxed out
Belly of the beast now
Now you got me feeling trapped and I can't look back
When the roller head is out and the Pabst is made of ash
And I'm going through the trash tryna' find a little treasure
Living for the better tryna get myself together

[Hook]

// Clean Up //

[Verse 1:]
The thoughts all cloudy in the marijuana sky
But it started raining molly
It got me feeling sorry while I'm feeling on myself
Cause I don't know this bitch name
But I'm feeling on my breast
I know it ain't right, but in this state I don't care
A whole week done went past, I don't go no where
Hotel rooms crushing pills and menus
Daughter sending me messages saying "Daddy I miss you"
But in this condition I don't think she need to see me
Ain't slept in four days, and I'm smelling like seaweed
Problems in my past haunt my future and the present
Escaping from reality got me missing my blessings
Sent a couple g's but that make it no better
And now I got habits that ain't getting no better
And it ain't that easy trying to get all together
Been stressing so long think depression done settled

[Hook: x2]
It's time for me to clean it up
I came to far to fuck it up like...

[Verse 2:]
Pops left mom when I was only 18
So rightfully that meant I had to be the man of things
And by 28 mom was damn near homeless
And now I'm 31 she 'bout to fucking cop her own shit
Triple beam dreams brought me nothing but nightmares
Thought that I was helping but the system don't fight fair
Cases had me locked up,
Mama always wrote me
Pops my only visit, they the only ones that loved me
That's why I feel bad, popping Givenchy tags
Knowing that this tee could feed my nephew for a week
For material I'm weak, acting like I don't care
I spend it all on clothes, then something is wrong there
I sent my mom some g's, but that makes it no better
Cause now I got habits that ain't getting no better
And it ain't that easy trying to get all together
Been stressing so long think depression done settled

[Hook]

// Red 2 Go //

Codeine in my cereal, always behind a smokey
I'm sorta like a miracle, you rappers are venereal
And never in my stereo, might spray your ass with vinegar
The next time that I see ya bro
Bet yo ass still won't be tight
The size of my dick nigga, every pussy tight
I write all night til the sun comes up
Dodging texts from yo sista tryna lick on my nuts
Cobra clutch the game, put that bitch into submission
Yo bitch want the stick shift, no transmission
Dawg, I'm on a mission, you're playing exhibition
On an expedition, poppin X but never trippin
Chillin with a vixen, tryna stick my dick in
Red head ho, like a young Kathy Griffin
Smoked too many blunts, I can hear my lungs whistlin'
Still rollin up, ho smellin like chicken
Rap Martin Lawrence, all you other rappers boring
Bruiser make 2 Live Crew look like some mormons
Nigga my essay is hard like a life-doin' ese
Gang banging on the yard with a home made machete
The nicest cassette tapes, stay smokin' heavy
Popped a couple pills, eye's glowing like Belly
Used to stash the cracks in the seams of my Pelle
Detroit nigga, but I'm smokin' on LA

[Hook]
And is anybody nervous?
I'm red to go [2x]
I said is anybody worried?
I'm red to go [2x]
Is anybody scared?
I'm red to go [2x]
Well I used to be afraid
I'm red to go [2x]

Tired of where I came from but know where I'm goin'
Tears in my eyes cause I'm smokin' on an onion
Aroma on that 'etra scary and McNairy
Off of moon rocks in Barcelona poppin' cherries
Blowjobs from model twins
Doin' drugs with acronyms
So many lines thought this shit was bush garden
Party startin' monster with the hair like Blanka
Hotel room like a hair metal concert
This blonde made the dick do the spring on [?]
You disrespect I hit you with the slap of Tatanka
Remember nigga used to eat shit that didn't match
Like cornbeef hash and some fuckin' Apple Jacks
Used to bag up the packs at [?] every night
Bologna all night, with no peanut butter, couldn't waste it on the mic
So I waste every night, everything came with rice
And I knew I wouldn't write
So I got my ass up, fuck dependin' on luck
Greyhound to NY bout 300 bucks
Kept my hopes up but my confidence was low
Now my self esteem is astral
Lookin' at this cash flow

Did it my way, I ain't nobody ho
I'm bout to pimp the rap game
Bitch I'm red to go [2x]

[Hook]

// Side B (Dope Song) //

[Verse 1:]
31 years old so I done been through all that dizzert
Came up off the porch straight serving off the crizzurb
Long time ago, I don't do that shit no mo'
This the last time I'm a tell you, wanna hear it?
(Here it goes!)
It was me and Baby James,
With an ounce to our name
Rollin' up to all the dimes, same clothes from yesterday
And I smoke a brand of kill so, plated this half this time
When that noise came in way head on the roof to smoke bones
Fuck with rap bitches, hiffin em hercs
Lost a sack but I got back cause the dice game was hittin'
It was me and Kung Pao breakin' day in the lobby
Nigga puffin' on dank sellin' rocks as a hobby
Bankroll in my pocket so everybody know me
Went home and gave my mama three hundred for some groceries
We hit the mall and ball
Hit the club and spend it all
Now I'm back to Square A
With them squares to get off

[Hook: x2]
Dope Song
Dope Song, Dope Song
Dope Song
Dope Song, Dope Song

[Verse 2:]
Crackhead Lisa
She used to be fit
Had sex with a trick, and now she sick
She offer you some head if give her some drugs
Just make sure you when you hit it you better wear a glove
I'm sick of all these niggas with their ten year old story
You ain't doin' that mo', nigga long time ensured
So take this as a diss song, cause this is my last song
(Bout my last dope song?)
Bout my last dope song

[Hook: x2]
Dope Song
Dope Song, Dope Song
Dope Song
Dope Song, Dope Song

// Dubstep //

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
I was thinkin' 'bout somethin'
But I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Remember when I was strugglin'
Fucked up on my knuckles
Tryin' to sell some dirt weed
Taxin' off a ten speed
Money wasn't comin'
For sure nigga I kept frontin'

[Hook:]
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
And I kept lickin' on that clit
Till she gave me that shit
I've been fucked up for so long
Swear to God I got a dib
I put my back into it
Servin' bags to them students
Tell 'em I got that fire
On that porch right there by the Buick
I'm just tryin' to get my mind
Go worry nigga 'bout yours
Rollin' up that swisher
Pourin' up a four
Servin' in them hallways
The courtrooms all day
Hoods kicked the door down
Now we in the conay

[Hook:]
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
I had them dubs on the step
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way
Slow days, fast days
Gettin' paper any way

[Verse 3: Scrufizzer]
It's the same old shit
Everybody in a manner that's up top
Buck stop,
It's killin' me,
Niggas are makin' really me,
'Cause I never can bottle up and they be filling it with the mideast
Stick it in a manner, the heaviest rhythm bangin' it out
Don't be let my money getting opposite and can do time
Listen up Danny Brown
I been doing this ting
Skipped in, then I come and lyrical assist 'em
WOO
I had my dubs on the step
I never stopped cause I sit in the booth, I'm finna choose
But I'm runnin this actually I'm realer than Scrooge
You ain't so why you act, dummy
You think you bad, well that's funny
I'm try'na get Maybach money
I'm a Mac Miller, stayin ASAP, rookie

I had them dubs on the step

// Dip //

[Hook:]
Dip I dip you dip I dip
Dip I dip you dip I dip
Dip you dip I dip
Dip you dip I dip
Don't let me into my zone [x3]
You haters leave me alone
I say, don't let me into my zone [x3]
You haters leave me alone

[Verse 1:]
Like Lieutenant Dan I'm rollin'
Back to back I keep on smokin'
Eyes keep shakin' and I can't stay focused
I don't give a fuck if you niggas ain't noticed
I'm sweatin' but I'm cold
Mouth all dry but I got a runny nose
I just bought me a water bottle
Chug that down but I think I need me some mo'
And I keep feelin' like I'm gon' faint
But fuck that nigga pass me that drank
I done drunk too much I might throw up in a hotel bathroom sink
Bitch I'm wildin, I'm zooted
Can't believe that I'm even movin'
Off a half a gram of molly we about to go party,
And I don't know what I'm doin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Now all these rappers talkin' bout that molly
Bet a million dollars these niggas ain't dippin'
Pure MDMA put it in a shot we talkin' bout crystals
Been dancin' hard up all day
Rest in peace to mac dre
Throw up the T
Scratch on my face
Do the Thizzle dance up in the place
I'm grindin on your bitch while I'm grindin' on my teeth
Don't give a flying fuck
So right now you don't want beef
I'm blown, I'm zooted
Can't believe that I'm even movin'
Off a half a gram of molly we about to go party,
And I don't know what I'm doin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
She licked it off my index
Before that she been wet
Now she licking on her best friend
While they suck me watching sunset
That's right bitch we ain't done yet
Lifting her purse, undress
It kicked in she lickin'
Before I blink she undressed
Molly making her feel good
It's a feeling she can't explain
But obvious we got some problems
So bitch let's kill that pain
I'm blown, I'm zooted
Can't believe I'm even movin'
Off a half a gram of molly we about to go party,
And I don't know what I'm doin'

[Hook]

// Smokin & Drinkin //

[Intro:]
Check
A-Trak, what up?

[Verse 1:]
Drop a deuce in that soda
Tell your ho to come over
Coming straight out that Motor
Sipping oil never sober
Bring backwoods of that OG, we smoking them back-to-back
Molly looking like sugar, so you know that I'm dipping it
See my jeans by the stack, and my shoes cost 'bout half of that
Let's not talk 'bout the shirt
She can't even pronounce that
Ghetto nigga on high end
My theory is low end
My tribe on a quest, put that money in motion
So bitch, we smoking and drink
Drinking and smoke
My ho got tats on her face
Sell me them cookies from Oakland
But not the kind that you eat, stuff it in Swisher Sweets
And we smoke blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt

[Bridge:]
I don't know what y'all be thinking
Spaced-out, rolling up that stinky
Big big blunts the size of pinkies
Pour one out, we still be leaning
I don't know what y'all be thinking
Smoking, drinking, drinking, smoking
In that order, we slow motion
'Til it's over, never stop

[Hook:]
Smoking and drink
Drinking and smoke
We be smoking and drink
Drinking and smoke [x3]

[Verse 2:]
Gotta get away, to escape, I smoke this kush to the face
Gotta get away, get away, I think I need the brain
Please oh Lord, oh Lord, I need your help again
Took too many pills, and I think I hear my heart beating
Taking over those chances, honey backwoods stuffed with that grammy
My ho blowing on that potter, mixing liquor with them xannies
Stress party, get away, hope that these problems just go away
Right there in my face, I ignore it every day

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Hook]

// Break It (Go) //

(Go, Go, Go, Go, Go, Go)
Don't stop 'til you break it, break it
Don't stop 'til you break it, break it
Don't stop 'til you break it, break it

Who the fuck is you fucking with
I been in the dirt like a catcher's mitt
I'm activist on Actavis
Won't smack a bitch, but I'm like a pimp
Long ass cudi, eatin' lots of shrimp
Got a wig and bring it back
She go in and bring it back
And make that booty go
Ain't no way gonna sleep with a whitey
Rob my nigga ho so furry
Ghetto Bill Murray, that's a whole nother story
What a nightmare when you see talking to your chick
Put this in your nosehole/nose, ho, then start sniffin'
Put this on your tongue ho, then start lickin
Y'all niggas shroomin', y'all better fall back [?]

Ain't no time to be playin'
Spit champagne when you hear what I'm sayin'
Exhale kush when I breathe on the mic
Everytime I rock like a diamond heist
Drop the lights when I drop the jewel
With that work, we make it twerk
Donât end up on your homeboyâs shirt
Cause you popped you a pill, now you feelin like a ho
Now you goin berserk
Iâm just tryin to see her shake it
Donât stop girl, just break it
Stick it out, then bring it back
Make that booty go â go go go
Donât stop til you break it

Girl just gimme your all [x3]
Hell no you canât have it all
Girl just gimme your all [x3]
Hell no you canât have it all

She had me on that wall
Drink in my hand with her ass on my balls
Sweatin, hot, and we rollin
Phone off service, got a couple missed calls
Girl donât stop just get it
After this, ho, I'mma lick it
Rubbin on your stomach while Iâm kissin on your neck
Thing gettin hard while Iâm rubbin on your breasts
Girl you make me wanna do things
When you grind all on that ding-a-ling
Make me wanna rip off your pants
Put my hand between your legs
Rubbin on them nipples
Wanna make that pussy dribble
Wanna bend that ass over then hit it from the back
Girl make that booty go

With that work, we make it twerk
Donât end up on your homeboyâs shirt
Cause you popped you a pill, now you feelin like a ho
Now you goin berserk
Iâm just tryin to see her shake it
Donât stop girl, just break it
Stick it out, then bring it back
Make that booty go â go go go
Donât stop til you break it

Girl just gimme your all [x3]
Hell no you canât have it all
Girl just gimme your all [x3]
Hell no you canât have it all

She had me on that wall
Drink in my hand with her ass on my balls
Sweatin, hot, and we rollin
Phone off service, got a couple missed calls
Girl donât stop just get it
After this, ho, I'ma lick it
Rubbin on your stomach while Iâm kissin on your neck
Thing gettin hard while Iâm rubbin on your breasts
Girl you make me wanna do things
When you grind all on that ding-a-ling
Make me wanna rip off your pants
Put my hand between your legs
Rubbin on them nipples
Wanna make that pussy dribble
Wanna bend that ass over then hit it from the back
Girl make that booty go

With that work, we make it twerk
Donât end up on your homeboyâs shirt

Donât stop girl, just break it
Stick it out, then bring it back
Make that booty go â go go go
Donât stop til you break it

// Handstand //

Check!
I will eat on them pajamas
Bite all on it like piranha
When it comes to that vagina
Baby girl you could be my dinner
Just lean back, and get it
Won't stop licking til you tell me quit
Let me suck on that clit while you follow my head
Baby girl I know you're with it, ball with me
Fall back on that outfit or something
And I love your thighs I can't deny
Work it like Twerk team and I think my dick want to be the sound
Rolling balls til' my dick hard, didn't say heard like a missed call
I don't really look like I'm trying to fuck and I probably won't care about her tomorrow
Dammit ho, what you trying to do "pour a deuce lets get chopped and screwed"
Fools gold, and you know, and Balmain mark down the shit
Smoking on that freeze, nigga
Got a nigga, amnesia nigga
Comatose and I need a dose
Wanna get behind that ass you got
Dipping to that Diplo
Throw it right when they play tonight
Looking right, thinking of dimes and I think I am gon' fuck her tonight
She lookin' ready to go, and fosho ainât gon stop
With her hands on the floor and her feet on the wall

[Hook]
Pop the pussy on a hand stand Ha-ha-ha-hand stand [x2]
(Shake that ass for a gangsta nigga)
Pop the pussy on a hand stand Ha-ha-ha-hand stand [x2]
(Shake that ass for a hipster nigga)

[Bridge]
Hands on the floor and her feet on the wall
And she pop that pussy like she ain't afraid to fall
When her hands on the floor and her feet on the wall
And she pop that pussy like she ain't afraid to fall

Let me see what you're working with
Don't stop girl keep twerkin' it
I'm watching you and I'm wondering if you could do that with my dick in it
She throw it back like a fire ball
Hit it up, order like a house call
Want to eat the cat, be from the back, then give that ho a mouthful
Hundred dollar pills we rolling, ass in the air she working
Don't care when we rolling, don't care when they rolling
Hundred dollar pills we rolling, ass in the air she working
Don't care when we rolling, don't feel when we rolling
Pop the pussy on hand stand, record that on my Handycam
That uncut, ludicrous
Feel that monkey I go Orangutan
You ain't met a nigga like this before
Eat it from the back, suck on ya toes
The way I put my mouth on it that pussy wet feeling [?]
Throw it back to that A-track, one hour to that Baauer
Now she got my dick hard, and I want to fuck her in the shower
Looking ready to go, oh fo' sho' I ain't go soft
Got her hands on floor, and her feet on the wall

// Way Up Here //

[Hook: Danny Brown]
Bitch, I'm way up here
Can't hear what you're saying
Gone with all that hating
So it's fuck you pay me [x2]

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Bitch, I'm way up here
You a tattoo to a statue
Run a mic like Michelangelo draw, too
While I turn this bitch into Saw II
Bitch, I'm way up here
And you down there on that totem pole
I'm on the road and I'll fuck your girl
And I'll put this dick up in a whirl
Bitch, I'm way up here
And you down there like a little nigga
I'll buy you up on that rent card
You still around here? You better thank God
Bitch, I'm way up here
I ain't worry about what's down there
I'll take a step, look on my shoe and you'll be splattered everywhere
Bitch, I'm way up here
Can't hear what none of y'all talking about
I'm on top of a mountain and you just started climbing rocks

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Bitch, Iâm way up here
Donât care what down there doing
âcause up here, up here, down there, down there
And you donât moving how Iâm movinâ

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Bitch, I'm way up here
Come on girls, you down?
You with it? I'm with it
Go on ahead, go down, uh
Bitch, I'm way up here
Puffing pot on a mountain top
Dipping in that bag
White girl on my countertop (Soulo)
Bitch, I'm way up here
Drop it like it's hot, ho
I ain't move no birds, but
She in love with my cock, though
Bitch, I'm way up here
Looking down on you little niggas
Got a 16 with a seal on it
Shot glass with a pill in it (Soulo)
Bitch, I'm way up here
Y'all all under my telescope
So much that I'm squintin'
You ain't snitchin', but you can tell 'em though
Bitch, I'm way up here
Hah, can't hear what you saying
Smoking on that strong, strong, like a super saiyan, saiyan
Bitch, I'm way up here
HiiiPower, Top Dawgs, all dogs, go to heaven, not y'all

// Kush Coma //

Close my eyes, feel like I'm going down
In an elevator at 90 miles an hour
And all I see is stars and they coming at me sort of like a meteor shower
My forehead's sweaty, my eyelids heavy, feeling like I ain't goin' make it
'Cause inside my head's like a firework show in the 4th July in Las Vegas
Said, I'm trippin', I'm slippin', feeling like I just can't move
I done took me a couple more pills
Next thing I know, I'm taking off my shoes
And I'm on walking on these clouds like marshmallows
Nodding off, smellin' like rose petals
Zoning out, two-three like the fiend in hell fire and angel wings
I'm conscious to that world, conning science 'bout that world
All these drugs up in me, it's a miracle I ain't mirror Kurt
I'm numb like a mortician, going dumb with Oakland bitches
They say you hella boosie, roll a backwood up with them cookies

[2x]
I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation
Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma and my brain going on vacation
Kush coma

Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma

[A$AP Rocky:]
Get high, my niggas, smoke kush
Get fly, my niggas, dope looks
So many numbers in my phone book
I could start a motherfucking phone book
Know all the fly bitches gonna look
Like I'm on something, tell 'em roll something
I'm that one nigga, bumping two pots
Be like three hoes, that's a foursome
Fuck niggas always want to hold something
Young hot nigga done froze on 'em
Went cold on 'em, beat the golds on 'em
And clothes on 'em, see the hoes on 'em?
Only fear God, never sold on Him
Man, I swear to God, put my soul on Him
Life's a bitch, but she chose on him
Should've died in Hell, but I rose on 'em
In big shades, fuck the hypocrites, die
Time let the tats, for the tick, tock
Clocks on the wall, fuck your wristwatch
Pause, let it stop, hope we get by
Bye when I zoom, let it vroom
'Bout a hundred goons with a fume, better let it fuse
A hundred miles an hour on the booth, better let it loose
A hundred by the sour, molly, flower, and they love the shrooms
That's real rap, I'm stating facts
Contradictions, can't take it back
Mommy's stripping, make it clap
In a kush coma, finna take a nap
I'm out

Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma

[Danny Brown:]
Half asleep with that cotton mouth
Weed grow house on plantation
Nuggets the size of Rakim rings
Got my head looking like a fatality screen
Got my mind drippin'
Gotta get away from all this bullshit in my way
Knowing goddamn well when the high go away
Same shit gon' be still in my way
I'm a slave to the sticky icky
So nigga roll something with me
Been smoking blunts since high school
Now look at all the bullshit I been through
Wanna pass out, but we staying up
Nigga gotta keep one eye open
'Cause nigga ain't tryna miss the next turn
Nigga roll up, then we starting smoking
I'm smoking on that ocho, got my mind on that cosmos
Sippin' on that purple, got a nigga in slo-mo
Dipping in that molly, feel like I'm doing 100 on a Harley
Tell your baby mama sorry, that was one night and please don't call me

[2x]
I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back
It's the blunt after blunt rotation
Now I'm in a kush coma off the OG aroma and my brain going on vacation
Kush coma

Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma
Kush coma, I am in a kush coma

// Float On //

[Verse 1:]
Backwood of that good to the pain for the brain
A cup of lean for me to sleep see I be going through things
Music business got me stressed Xanax to maintain
Waking up on wrong sides got me writing in vain
Vicodin to numb me up help me cope with the struggle
Remember praying to get in there saying rap to my brothers
And now I got the whole world listening
Give your ear for a second a life changing decision
Every other minute thoughts run through my mind
About how bad I wanted this but I cannot waste time
So I'm trapped in the beat stuck on every line
Nothing else matters except my next rhyme
You can never understand all the pressure I'm against
Getting high thinking how to make it better than your last shit
Might have a mental breakdown
If it wasn't for these pills here now
And no matter how it gets I hold on
Rolling up this dope to cope I float on
Nigga I float on

[Hook x4: Charli XCX]
I float on
Let's go
Hop up in the Chevy 4 door let's roll

[Verse 2:]
Remember back when mommy sent me for the Wonder Bread
And niggas jumped me stomped on my fucking head
It's like I learned right then you either sink or you swim
And to beat your enemy you gotta think like them
So I was up late breaking day with the gremlins
Music in my heart but my thoughts wouldn't listen
Hood outta bye bye cause rap shit was sci-fi
So I'm tormented with the things I seen with these eyes
Can't get a wink unless I'm leaning off of syrup
Dreaming of my past like a nightmare so I wake up
Staring at the ceiling with this feeling that won't go away
Until the verse is done wrote all day but them shits throwaway
So I'm breaking day sniffing Adderall writing
And not for the money for the life after dying
Pray I get old just to hear I been the future
Just to see my influence in this genre of music
And might make it to see somehow
If it wasn't for these pills here now
And no matter how it gets I hold on
Rolling up this dope to cope I float on
Nigga I float on

[Hook x4: Charli XCX]
