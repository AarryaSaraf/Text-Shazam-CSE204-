Album: TheBalladOfDoodJuanita

// Prologue //

Come hear a tale out of the trails of ol' Cantuckee Hills
Hear a story from the year they started hiding stills
Back in pioneering days of 1862
About a maiden named Juanita and a man called Dood

It's a story of its time
When time was tough on a man
When all he had to get by was a blade and powder can

Ol' Dood was an eagle eye, Juanita was his dove
He was a mighty mountain man
She was his one true love

// Ol' Dood (Part I) //

One and all have heard the stories and eyewitness had been sworn
About a man born in Hard Burly back in June of '29
Must've got that Martin Meylin muzzle the day he was born
Things he could do with that rifle
Blow the balls off a bat, reload and shoot it one more time

Had an monster of a mule, was a mighty fine steed
Sham, and Sam, that tomahawk, and that Flintlocks all he need
Finding food and finding trouble and always takin' heed
And any man that crossed him was surely gonna bleed
And he'd stretch you up and burn you for callin' him half breed

Left the varnish off his words, feared no beast nor man
Didn't wanna end up in his debt 'cause it'd damn sure get paid
He was harder than the nails hammered Jesus' hands
He was the one they called Dood
Son of a mountain miner and a Shawnee maiden

Wore a size 17 ring, had hands like a bear
And if he got 'em on ya, he's takin' that top hair
His Grandfather taught him how to hunt and how to live off the land
Taught him how to take a scalp when you kill a man

He was a deadly warrin' daddy with a gun gleam in his eye
Till he found him a good woman that calmed down the rage
He built a home from the land with the hands good Lord gave him
And ol' Dood got his own food
Had no need for the scrip that ol' coal company paid

Left the varnish off his words, feared no beast nor man
And if either came upon him, they'd damn sure get slayed
He was harder than the nails hammered Jesus' hands
He was the one they called Dood
Son of a mountain miner and a Shawnee maiden
Son of a mountain miner and a Shawnee maiden

// One In The Saddle, One On The Ground //

First time ol' Dood
Laid eyes on Juanita
He knew then and there
She was the one
She gave him a love
Every man knows is needed
She gave him a daughter
She gave him a son

One day while Juanita
Was out in the garden
A bandit rode up
Without making a sound
Dood was working the plow
Far away from his rifle
Tried to get to it
But the Bandit drew down

Last thing he remembered
Was Juanita screaming
As the world faded black
And Dood crumpled down
When he came to, the bandit
Was nowhere to be seen
His true love Juanita
Nowhere to be found

A man and his rifle
A mule and his hound
One in the saddle
One on the ground

He saw the ball had passed through
Clean as a church floor
And the wound was washed up
By Sam his old hound
So he saddled up Shamrock
And powdered his rifle
And put on his old hat
Worn, weathered, and brown

Told his son to stay strong
Take care of his sister
Till Daddy returned
With Mama safe and sound
Then they set out together
To go find Juanita
Ol' Dood in the saddle
And Sam on the ground
Vowing never to stop
Till Juanita is found

A man and his rifle
A mule and his hound
One in the saddle
One on the ground
One in the saddle
One on the ground

// Shamrock //

Never was a finer breed than the steed who was Shamrock
Plain to see by his confirmation that he came from finest stock
Daddy was black mammoth jack, mama was a thoroughbred mare
Had four white feet on a buckskin coat, blonde mohawk in his hair
Stood about 19 hands, didn't need no kick to go
With ol' Dood up top, deep in the saddle, hollering
Whoa, boy, whoa
Whoa, boy, whoa

Only ever had one rider, anyone else was gettin' bucked
Cross any kind of land, through the rain, snow, and muck
Surefooted as a billy goat, with 33 inch ears
Clog dance on a snake with his front two feet, give coyotes the rear
Kick so hard it'll send 'em up and out the stratosphere
Make a coyote fly so far, it wouldn't land until next year
From the hightop to the holler, no place Sham can't go
With ol' Dood up top, deep in the saddle, hollering
Whoa, boy, whoa
Whoa, boy, whoa

Ain't scared to cross that river, jump clear across that crick
Steed don't need no shoes when his hooves is one foot thick
Leather and tack can't hold him back, he'll bite right through a bit
Rope bridle made of mooring line was the only thing that'd fit
Hot on the bandits trail, fence posting through the snow
Ol' Dood up top, high in the saddle, hollering
Go, boy, go
Go, boy, go
Go, boy, go
Go, boy, go

// Played Out //

Trails gone cold
And here comes the rain
Been chewin on willow bark
To hold back the pain
Puttin juice n the wound
Lettin' it drain
Holes in my buckskin
Still wet with blood stain
Been pushing too hard
And going insane
Lord don't let this journey
Be all in vain

'Cause I'm played out
Down to my last draw
This biting feeling
Is startin' to gnaw
It's the saddest picture
You ever saw
Played out and riding
Ruff, ragged, and raw

Staying up on the ridge
Tryin to keep the high ground
Shoulder is throbbin
I'm wearin down
Shamrocks head is bobbin
And I don't hear the hound
After five days and nights
Following his sound
Sam done went silent
He's nowhere to be found
Oh wait I see him
Lying there on the ground

Oh he's played out
Thorn stuck and blood raw
Torn plum all to pieces
He's done worn off his paws
Then ol' Sam let out
His last dying bay call
So I dug him a grave
And covered it all

// Sam //

Well a good dog on the ground's worth three in the saddle
No matter where your from
Been many good dog, was a friend to a man
But Sam was the greatest one
He was the hound of hounds
He was the wonder of all walkers
He loved howling at the moon
He loved treeing that raccoon
Most of all he was my best friend and he's gone too soon

He was the runt of the litter
But a plenty mean pup
Put Sam on the scent and he never let up
Spent his nights on the porch
Chewin on a bear bone
Now he's underground
And I'm all alone

Well a good dog on the ground's worth three in the saddle
No matter where your from
Been many good dog, was friend to a man
But Sam was the greatest one
He was the hound of hounds
He was the wonder of all walkers
He loved howling at the moon
He loved treeing that raccoon
Most of all he was my best friend and he's gone too soon

// Juanita //

There's an ocean of stars
Hovering over me
I lay under them dreaming
Your face all I see
I'm caught up in fever
And shivering too
All that's keeping me alive is the thought of losing you

Juanita
When I found you I was at my end
So hold on, Juanita
I'll find you again

You are the ocean
I am a grain of sand
In waves of emotion
A violent and craven man
But the day that I found you
Calm washed over the storm
The sun came up in soft blue eyes and the moon in arms so warm

Juanita
Where'd your mama get that name?
There's no seÃ±oritas
From the mountains where you came
And if I ever saw one
She wouldn't be pretty as you
With black hair so long and soft eyes so blue

Juanita, I'll search the world till you're in my hands
Juanita, I'll find you
I'll find you again

// Go In Peace //

When he woke up
He saw the faces of the mighty Cherokee
They'd found Shamrock and him
Passed out together
Underneath the forest canopy
Saw his Tomahawk and skins
And knew that he was a Shawnee
So to see the Chief he now must go
One and all they did agree

The old man stared into his soul
Though he was blind
As he could be
Said if you're looking for your woman
It is here that you shall find she
Said a man McClure had traded her for horses
On which he used so he could flee
Dood said she wasn't his to trade
He stole her away and he shot me
Then the old man whispered softly
Her you now must go and see

When she saw him
She cried tears of joy
And he saw his soul
In eyes blue as sea
Chief didn't need no eyes to know he was hers
And she belonged to he
He said "I'm sorry for your troubles"
"She must go back home with thee"
Said get your mule
And waved his palm
Said you both now may go in peace
So Dood climbed back up
On ol Shamrock
He and Juanita went home happily

// Epilogue //

Now that mama's safe 'n' sound
Home peaceful and secure
He set back out on Shamrock
To find and kill McClure
It didn't take him very long
To track ol' Seamus down
McClure wanted Juanita back and wanted to be found

// Ol' Dood (Part II) //

He found Seumas sitting in a bottom perched upon a bay
Dood figured that he was about three hundred yards away
But Saemus didn't know that he was deadly as can be
Thought he was out of range of that rifle from Cantuckee

Dood laid that old long rifle right across a fallen tree
Took moonlight sight on Seumas let that iron ball fly free
His shot was true as David's rock and it found its mark for sure
Knocked him flying from his horse the one they call McClure

Left the varnish off his words, feared no beast nor man
And if either came upon him they'd damn sure get slayed
He was harder than the nails hammered Jesus' hands
He was the one they called Dood
Son of a mountain miner and a Shawnee maiden

Ol' Dood walked down the holler to go inspect his man
He found Seumas playing possum knife ready in his hand
But Ol' Dood saw it coming, beat him to the draw
Moon went bouncing off that tomahawk is the last thing ol' Seumas ever saw

He left the varnish off his words, feared no beast nor man
Didn't wanna end up in his debt, 'cause it'd damn sure get paid
He was harder than the nails hammered Jesus' hands
He was the one they called Dood
Son of a mountain miner and a Shawnee maiden
Son of a mountain miner and a Shawnee maiden
