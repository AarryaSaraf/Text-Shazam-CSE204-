// Welcome To Earth (Pollywog) //

Hello, my son
Welcome to earth
You may not be my last
But you'll always be my first
Wish I'd done this ten years ago
But how could I know
How could I know
That the answer was so easy
I've been told you measure a man
By how much he loves
When I hold you
I treasure each moment I spend
On this earth, under heaven above
Grandfather always said God's a fisherman
And now I know the reason why

And if some times daddy has to go away
But please don't think it means I don't love you
Oh, how I wish I could be there everyday
Cause when I'm gone it makes me so sad and blue
And holding you is the greatest love I've ever known
When I get home it breaks my heart
Seeing how much you've grown all on your own

Hearing you cry makes me cry
It made me cry
Hearing me cry
A thousand miles away
Every cry
(greatest love I've ever known)
(ever known)

// Breakers Roar //

Oh, how the breakers roar
They keep pulling me farther from shore
Thoughts turn to a love so kind
Just to keep me from losing my mind
So enticing, deep dark seas
It's so easy to drown in the dream

Oh, and everything is not what it seems
This life is but a dream
Shatter illusions that hold your spirit down
Open up your heart and you'll find love all around
Breathing and moving are healing
And soothing away
All the pain in life holding you down

Bone break and heals
Oh, but heartaches can kill
From the inside, so it seems
Oh, I'm telling you it's all a dream
It's all a dream
It's all a dream
It's all a dream
It's all a...
It's all a dream

// Keep It Between The Lines //

Don't turn mailboxes into baseballs
Don't get busted selling at seventeen
Most thoughts deserve about two or three more
Motoroil is motoroil
Just keep your engine clean
Keep your eyes on the prize
Everything will be fine
Long as you stay in school
Stay off the hard stuff
And keep between the lines

Don't burn two lanterns at the same time
No ship out on the water will pay your rent
Cause you live and you learn
Sometimes you get burned
When your get out done got up
Walked out the door and went
Do as I say
Don't do as I've done
It don't have to be
Like a father, like his son

Don't let them try to upsell you
There's a reason they make chocolate and vanilla, too
If there's any doubt, there is no doubt
The gut don't never lie
And the only word you'll ever need to know in life is "why"
Keep your head out of the clouds
And remember to be kind
And just stay in school
Stay off the drugs
And keep between the lines

(Don't, don't sweat the small stuff)
(Can't sweat the small stuff)
(Don't sweat the small stuff)

// Sea Stories //

Basic was just like papaw says
"Keep your mouth shut and you'll be fine"
Just another enlisted egg
In the bowl for Uncle Sam's beater
When you get to Dam Neck
Hear a voice in your head
Saying, "my life's no longer mine"
Have you running with some SAD SOG
BMF sandeaters

Setting out on them high seas
Feels just like being born
That first port call in Thailand
Feels like a pollywog turning nineteen
They've got king cobras fighting in boxing rings
And all the angels play Connect Four
Seems like a sailor's paradise
But turns out to be a bad dream

Now you hit the ground running in Tokyo
From Kawasaki to Ebisu
Yokosuka, Yokohama, and Shinjuku
Shibuya, Ropongi, and Harajuku
Aw, from Pusan and Pohang, Pattaya to Phuket
From Singapore to Kuala Lumpur
Seen damn near the whole damn world
From the inside of a bar

I've got sea stories
They're all true
Might seem a little bit far-fetched
But why would I lie to you
Memories of ink forever stained
Still got salt running through my veins
I've got sea stories
And my shellback, too

Sometimes Sirens send a ship off course
Horizon gets so hazy
Maybe get high, play a little GoldenEye
On that old 64
And if you get sick and can't manage the kick
And get yourself kicked out the navy
You'll spend the next year trying to score
From a futon life raft on the floor
And the next fifteen trying to figure out
What the hell you did that for

But flying high beats dying for lies
In a politician's war

// In Bloom //

Sell the kids for food
Weather changes moods
Spring is here again
Reproductive glands

[Chorus:]
Heâs the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he don't know what it means
Don't know what it means to love someone

We can have some more
Nature is a whore
Bruises on the fruit
Tender age in bloom

[Chorus x3]

Love someone, no

// Brace For Impact (Live A Little) //

One day you wake up
And this life will be over
Every party must break up
For burdens to shoulder
We're dying to live
Living to die
No matter what you believe
And all of us cry
For the ones we must leave

So go and live a little
Bone turns brittle
And skin withers before your eyes
Make sure you give a little
Before you go to the great unknown in the sky

Some will beg for forgiveness
From someone above
For something they did
To someone they love
Some scream like a baby
Some go out crying
Some bid the world goodbye
And welcome to die

Go out and live a little
Bone turns brittle
And skin withers before your eyes
Make sure you give a little
Before you go to the great unknown in the sky

// All Around You //

There will be days
When the sun won't shine
When it seems like the whole world is against you
Don't be afraid
Life is unkind
You can let go of the pain if you choose to

Cause time slips away
Skies fall apart
Revealing to all
A universal heart
Glowing, flowing, all around you

There will be nights that go on forever
Like you're long-lost at sea
Never to be found
Just know in your heart
That we're always together
And long after I'm gone
I'll still be around

Cause our bond is eternal
And so is love
God is inside you
All around you
And up above
Glowing, showing you the way

Cause time slips away
Skies fall apart
Revealing to all
A universal heart
Glowing, flowing, all around you

// Oh Sarah //

Oh Sarah, here we go again
I can't get past the pain of what I want to say to you
I'm too old now to learn how to let you in
So I'll run away just like I always do
She said if there's something I should know then tell me now
Before I go and give my heart away
So I can get on with my life
You can go on with your strife
Wish you'd speak the words those eyes are trying to say

Sometimes this life feels like a big old dream
I'm floating around on a cloud inside
When my cloud starts coming apart at the seams
Oh Sarah, that's when I slide

There's going to be times that I gotta go away
But don't worry baby I'll come home
Out on the road is where I'm going to find my way
But I'll always find the time when I'm alone
So forgive me if sometimes I seem a little crazy
But god damn, sometimes crazy is how I feel
And my brain is starting to swirl
Down the drain of this old world
And there's only one thing girl I know is real

It's the love that I feel in your arms
It's the glow you wear around you like a charm
It's the tender in your eyes
That keeps me safe and warm at night
From this life

Sometimes this life feels like a big old dream
I'm floating around on a cloud inside
When my cloud starts coming apart at the seams
Oh Sarah, that's when I slide

// Call To Arms //

I done Syria, Afghanistan,Iraq and Iran
North Korea, tell me where does it end
Well the bodies keep piling up with everyday
How many more of them they're gonna send
Well they sent their sons and daughters off to die 
for some war to control the heroin
Well, son I hope you don't grow up
Believin' that you've got to be a puppet to be a man

Well they cut off your hair and put a badge on your arm
Strip you off your identity
Tell you to keep your mouth shut boy and get in the line
Meet your maker overseas
Wearin' that Kim Jong-il hat while your grandma is selling pills stat
Meanwhile I'm wearing 'can't pay my fucking bills' hat

Nobody is lookin' up to care about a drone
All too busy lookin' down at our phone
Our ego's begging for a food like a dog from our feed
Refresing obsessively until iur eyes start to bleed
They serve up distractions and we eat them with fries
Until the bombs fall out of our fucking skies

Turn off the TV
Turn off the news
Nothin' to see here
They're serving the blues

Bullshit on my TV
Bullshit on my radio
The Hollywood telling me how to be me
The bullshit's got to go
