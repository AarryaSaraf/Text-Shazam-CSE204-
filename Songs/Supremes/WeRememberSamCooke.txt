// You Send Me //

You send me (Send me)
I know you send me (Send me)
Darling, you send me (Send me)
Honest you do
Honest you do
Honest you do

Ooh, you thrill me (Thrill me)
I know you thrill me (Thrill me)
Darling, you thrill me (Thrill me)
Honest you do
Honest you do
Honest you do

At first I thought it was infatuation
But, ooh, it lasted so long
Now I find myself wanting
To marry you
And take you home

Woo,
You send me (Send me)
I know you send me (Send me)
Darling, you send me (Send me)
Honest you do
Honest you do
Honest you do

Oh, whenever I'm with you
I know, I know, I know that I need you
You thrill me
Honest you do
Honest you do
Honest you do

I know, I know, I know you're with me
I know, I know, I know whenever I need you
You send me
Honest you do
Honest you do
Honest you do

// Nothing Can Change This Love //

If I go a million miles away
I write a letter each and every day
'Cause honey, nothin', 
Nothin' can ever change this love 
I have for you

Ooh, make me weep, 
You can make me cry
See me comin'
And you can pass me by
I know that nothin', 
nothin' can ever change this love 
I have for you

Oh, you're the apple of my eye
You're cherrie pie
Oh you're cake and ice cream
You're sugar and spice
And everything nice
You're the boy of my, my, my dreams

If you wanted to leave me
And roam
When you get back
I'd just say
Welcome home, 
I know that nothin', 
Nothin' can ever change the love 
I have for you

I know that nothin', 
Nothin' can ever change the love 
I have for you

// Cupid //

Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me

Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now I don't mean to bother you
But I'm in distress
There's danger of me losing all of my happiness
For I love a guy who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix

So, Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me

Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now, Cupid, if your arrow makes his love strong for me
I promise I will love him until eternity
I know between the two of us his heart we can steal
Help me if you will

So, Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me

Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now, Cupid, don't you hear me calling
Cupid

// Chain Gang //

Ho Ha Ho Ha
I hear someon sayin'
Ho Ha Ho Ha
Ho Ha Ho Ha

Well don't you know
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang

All day long they're saying
Ho Ha Ho Ha
Ho Ha Ho Ha

Well don't you know
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang

All day long they work so hard
'Till the sun is going down, down
Workin' on the highways and byways and wearing
Wearing a frown
You hear them moaning
Their lives away
Then you hear somebody say

That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang

They're saying...
I'm going home one of these days
I'm going home
See my woman whom I love so dear
Mean while
I have to work right here

Well don't you know
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
Workin' on the chain gang

All they long they're saying...
My, my, my work is so hard
Give me water
I'm thirsty
My work is so hard

// Bring It On Home To Me //

If you ever change your mind about leaving
Leaving me behind
Oh, oh, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving 
Bring it on home to me
Yeah, yeah

You know I laughed when you left
But you know I only hurt myself
Bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me

I'll give you jewelery and money too
But that's not all I'd do for you
Bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me

I know I'll always be your slave
'Til I'm buried, buried in my grave
Oh bring, bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah, yeah

// Only Sixteen //

He was only sixteen
Only sixteen
I loved him so
But he was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know

We'd laughed at sixteen
And do little things
That makes my heart glow
But he was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know

Now, why did I give my heart so fast
It will never happen again
But I was a mere girl of sixteen
I've aged a year since then

He was only sixteen
Only sixteen
With eyes that would glow
But he was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know

Why did he give your heart so fast
It never will happen again
But you was a mere girl of sixteen
I've aged a year since then

He was only sixteen
Only sixteen
I loved him so
But he was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know

He was only sixteen
Only sixteen
I loved him so
But he was too young to fall in love
And I was too young to know

Only sixteen
Only sixteen
I loved him so...

// Havin' A Party //

We are having a party
Dancing to the music
Played by the D.J.
On the radio

The cokes are in the ice box
Popcorn's on the table
Me and my baby
We're out here on the floor

So mister, mister D.J.
Keep those records playing
'Cause we're having such a good time
Dancing with my baby

Havin' a party
Everybody's swinging, dancing to the music
On the radio

We are havin' a party
Everybody's swinging, dancing to the music
On the radio

So mister, mister D.J.
Keep those records playing
'Cause we're having such a good time
Dancing with my baby

Sally's doing that twist
If you take requests
I've got a few for you
Play that song called "Shot gun"
Play that one called "My girl"
Don't forget them
No other song will do

// Shake //

Shake, shake, shake

Listen while I talk to you
Tell you what we're gonna do
There's a new dance going around
And I tell you that we're putting you down
Just move your body all around

Shake, oh mama shake
Shake, I said that's the way to do it
Shake, come on you're looking good now

Shake it like a bowl of soup
Make your body loop de loop
Put your hands on your hip
You kinda let your back bone slip

Just move your body like a whip
And just shake, oh mama
Shake, I said that's the way to do it
Shake, come on now girls

Dingelingeling, honey shakin' is the latest thing
And if you wanna swing
Just loosen up your shoulders

And if you wanna really roll
You got to do the thing with soul
Shake it, shake it with all your might
And now if you do it, do it right

Just move your body loose tonight
And just shake, oh mama
Shake, come on honey 
Shake, I said that's the way to do it

Loosen up your shoulders
And if you wanna really roll
You gotta do the thing with soul
Shake it, shake with all your might
And now if you do it, do it right

Just make your body loose tonight
And just shake, oh mama
Shake, I say that's the way to do it
Shake, come on now girls

Shake, come on now Florence
Shake, I say that's the way to do it
Shake, come on now Mary
Shake, come on now Supremes
And shake, I say that's the way to do it
Shake, come on now mama
Shake, I say that's the way to do it
Shake?

// Wonderful World //

Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about science book
Don't know much about the French I took

But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be

Don't know much geography
Don't know much trigonometry
Don't know much about algebra
Don't know what a slide rule is for

But I know that one and one is two
And if this one could be with you
What a wonderful this would be

I don't claim to be an "A" student
But I'm trying to be
Maybe my being an "A" student baby 
I can win your love for me

Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about science book
Don't know much about the French I took

But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be

But I know that one and one is two
And if this one could be with you
What a wonderful this would be

// A Change Is Gonna Come //

I was born by the river 
In a little tent
And just like the river
I've been running ever since

It's been a long, long time coming
But I know a change gonna come
Oh, yes it is 

It's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die
I don't know what's up there beyond the sky

It's been a long, long time coming 
But I know a change gonna come
Oh yes it will

Then I go to my brother 
I say brother help me please
But he winds up knocking me 
Back down on my knees

There's been times that I thought 
I wouldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to carry on
It's been a long, long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come
Oh, yes it will
