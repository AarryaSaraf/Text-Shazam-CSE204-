// Leave Before The Lights Come On //

Well this is a good idea,
He wouldn't do it if it wasn't,
He wouldn't do it if it wasn't one.
Well my friend fancies you,
Oh what a way to begin it all,
You said, "They're always exciting words to hear."

And they woke up together not quite realising how,
Awkwardly stretching and yawning,
It's always hard in the morning

And I suppose that's the price you pay,
Well oh it isn't what it was,
She's thinking he looks different today,
And now there's nothing left to guess now,

They left before the lights came on,
Because they didn't want to ruin,
What it was that was brewing,
Before they absolutely had to,
And how can you wake up,
With someone you don't love?
And not feel slightly fazed by it,
Oh, he had a struggle,

And they woke up together not quite realising how,
Awkwardly stretching and yawning,
It's always hard in the morning,

And I suppose that's the price you pay,
Well oh it isn't what it was,
She's thinking he looks different today,
And now there's nothing left to guess now,

Well, quick, let's leave, before the lights come on,
'Cause then you don't have to see,
'Cause then you don't have to see,
What you've done...

Well, quick, let's leave, before the lights come on,
'Cause then you don't have to see,
'Cause then you don't have to see,
What you've done...

I'll walk you out, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you out, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you out, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you out.

// Put Your Dukes Up, John //

Just put your dukes up, John,
Yeah, put your dukes up, John,
You were preened and sanitized
Struck dumb by good advice

Your integrity was bruised
Your celebrity a ruse
They pulled the rug from under
Made way for new pretenders

Change your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
Change your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
(Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John)

And be a C-Y-N-I-C
Be a C-Y-N-I-C

The profit margin blinds them
They groomed and ostracized him
His calm makes my blood boil
His calm makes my blood boil

Change your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
Change your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
(Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John
Put your dukes up, John)

And be a C-Y-N-I-C
Be a C-Y-N-I-C

Change your tune and change your hair
Or your not going anywhere
(Put your dukes up, John,)
(Be a C-Y-N-I-C)

// Baby I'm Yours //

[ALEX:]

Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm yours) 

And I'll be yours until the stars fall from the sky, 

Yours, until the rivers all run dry 

In other words, until I die 

[OISIN:]

Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm yours) 

And I'll be yours until the sun no longer shines, 

Yours, until the poets run out of rhyme 

In other words, until the end of time 

[ALEX:]

I'm gonna stay right here by your side, 

Do my best to keep you satisfied 

Nothin' in the world could drive me away 

'Cause every day, you'll hear me say 


Baby, I'm yours (Baby, I'm yours) 

And I'll be yours until two and two is three, 

Yours, until the mountains crumble to the sea 

In other words, until eternity 


Baby, I'm yours 

(Til the stars fall from the sky) 

Baby, I'm yours 

(Til the rivers all run dry) 

Baby, I'm yours 

(Til the sun no longer shines) 

Baby, I'm yours 

(Til the poets run out of rhymes)
