// Civilization //

Stand in line as we march to the drums of the east,
Paralyzed and possessed by crusaders deceased,
Lost to the sirens that call from the turbulent tide,
Bound by the science that lives on the lips of the wise...

The beating of a million drums,
The fire of a million guns,
The mother of a million sons,
Civilization!

The beating of a million drums,
The fire of a million guns,
The mother of a million sons,
Civilization!

Stand aside as they bow to the call of the beast,
Tantalized and seduced by the demons released,
Cast to the ground by the whim of the merciless sky
Born to the fire that burns in the all-seeing eye...

The beating of a million drums,
The fire of a million guns,
The mother of a million sons,
Civilization!

The beating of a million drums,
The fire of a million guns,
The mother of a million sons,
Civilization!

The beating of a million drums...
The fire of a million guns...
The mother of a million sons...
Civilization.

The beating of a million drums,
The fire of a million guns,
The mother of a million sons,
Civilization!

The beating of a million drums,
The fire of a million guns,
The mother of a million sons,
Civilization!

// On'n'on //

Before day break there were none
And as it broke there was one
The moon, the sun, it goes on'n'on

The winter battle was won
The summer children were born
And so the story goes on'n'on

Come woman if your life beats
Those we buried with the house keys
Smoke and feather where the fields are
Green from here to eternity

Come woman in your own time
Far far far from the virgin vine
Rising out from the dead leaves
Come back to me

Oh sing your favorite song
Left to tears
Dreams it goes and then on

A vessel in the bloodline
The 13th zodiac sign
A stitch in time it goes on'n'on

Someday the grapes will be wine
And someday you will be mine
And so the story goes on'n'on

Come woman if your life beats
Those we buried with the house keys
Smoke and feather where the fields are
Green from here to eternity

Come woman in your own time
Far far far from the virgin vine
Rising out from the dead leaves
Come back to me

Oh sing your favorite song
Left to tears
Dreams it goes and then on

Oh sing your favorite song
Left to tears
Dreams it goes and then on

// New Lands //

You
So you're running in a best of three
And you gunning on the kingside
For the queen

You
So you're running in a best of three
And you gunning for it all
May the king fall

New lands
Trust embedded on the sand
New lands
Trust embedded on the sand
New lands
Trust in us embedded on the sand
New lands

You
Say you're running in a best of three
And you gunning on the kingside
For the queen

You
So you're running in a best of three
And you gunning for it all
May the king fall

New lands
Trust embedded on the sand
New lands
Trust embedded on the sand
New lands
Trust in us embedded on the sand
New lands

New lands
New lands
New lands
New lands

New lands
Trust embedded on the sand
New lands
Trust embedded on the sand
New lands
Trust in us embedded on the sand
New lands

New lands
Trust embedded on the sand
New lands
Trust embedded on the sand
New lands
Trust in us embedded on the sand
New lands
