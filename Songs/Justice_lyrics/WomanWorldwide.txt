Figure it out [x3]

By the laws of attraction
And the rules of the game
(Figure it out)
There's a chemical reaction
Between pleasure and pain

Closer
Closer for there to be
Pleasure

Is there more to seduction?
Is it wrong? Is it vain?
(Figure it out)
Is it love or easy action?
Is it all just the same?

Can anyone read, anyone feel
That I'm losing my patience, I just came here to bounce
Ladies all waxed, they all know I'm coming
I'm losing my patience, I just came here to bounce
D-V-N-O
Four capital letters, printed in gold
Cause details make the girls sweat even more
While they're shaking their belts
No need to ask my name to figure out how cool I am

Can anyone read, anyone feel
That I'm losing my patience, I just came here to bounce
Ladies all waxed, they all know I'm coming
I'm losing my patience, I just came here to bounce

// Stop (WWW) //

So many times we rise and fall
After a while it's coming all together
Together
So many times we rise and fall
Wondering if we'll find it all together
Together

Remember all the nights and days we spent together
(Together)
It's so easy to forget and to surrender
But nothing's ever stopped

Music and lights
Rhythm and melodies
(Take us to the top)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lights
Rhythm and melodies
(But nothing's ever stopped)
So many nights
So many memories

So many times we rise and fall
After a while it's coming all together
(Together)
So many ways to lose it all
Living a future we won't have to give up
Together

Remember all the nights and days we spent together
(Together)
It's so easy to forget and to surrender
But nothing's ever stopped

Music and lights
Rhythm and melodies
(Take us to the top)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lights
Rhythm and melodies
(But nothing's ever stopped)
So many nights
So many memories

(But nothing's ever stopped)

Rhythm and melodies

// Randy (WWW) //

Get up and shake it off
It's time that you listen up and hear the call
Bail out the water
Better not, you're on fire
Backed against the wall

Don't stop, try to make your mark
And make your mind up
Don't stop, work it out and try to make it

Randy, get yourself together
Got to get it up to make it better
Randy, you don't have to suffer
Step outside and find yourself a lover
When you know you've arrived
And it's time, don't shoot low
Aim it high
When you know you've arrived
And it's time, take it slow
Shoot it high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high, high
