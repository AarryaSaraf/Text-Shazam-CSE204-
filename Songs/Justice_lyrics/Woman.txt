Album: Woman

// Safe And Sound //

Man up, hold tight, driving dark
Head up, foot down, speed of sound
Time's up, kick start, keep on track
Flags out, sit back, safe and sound
[repeated]

// Pleasure //

By the laws of attraction
And the rules of the game
(Figure it out)
There's a miracle reaction
Between pleasure and pain

Use imagination
As a destination
Use imagination
As a destination
Use imagination
And come closer
Forever be

Closer
Closer for there to be
Pleasure
Closer
Forever be

Is there more to seduction?
Is it wrong? Is it fame?
Is it love or easy action?
Is it all just insane?

Use imagination
As a destination
Use imagination
As a destination
Use imagination
And come closer
Forever be

Closer
Closer for there to be
Pleasure
Closer
Forever be

Closer and closer
Forever be
Closer
Forever be
Closer and closer
Forever be
Come closer
Forever be

Use imagination
As a destination
Use imagination
As a destination
Use imagination
As a destination
Use imagination
As a destination

'Long as long as you believe
Then you hold the key
Use imagination
As a destination

Use imagination
As a destination
Use imagination
As a destination
'Long as long as you believe
Then you hold the key
Use imagination
And arrive
Use imagination
As a destination
Use imagination
As a destination
'Long as long as you believe
Then you hold the key
Use imagination
And arrive
Use imagination
As a destination
Use imagination
As a destination
'Long as long as you believe
Then you hold the key
Use imagination
And arrive
Use imagination
As a destination
Use imagination
As a destination
'Long as long as you believe
Then you hold the key
Use imagination
And arrive

Love has made me reason
Love has made me seasoned
It's a game of giving, nothing more
Love has made me reason
Love has made me seasoned
Conflicting opens in the dark
Love has made me reason
Love has made me seasoned
It's a game of giving, nothing more
Love has made me reason
Love has made me seasoned
Conflicting opens in the dark

Love has made me reason
Love has made me seasoned
It's a game of giving, nothing more
Love has made me reason

Conflicting opens in the dark

Love has made me seasoned
It's a game of giving, nothing more
Love has made me reason
Love has made me seasoned
Conflicting opens in the dark

These nights are full of fire
Fire
These nights are full of fire
Fire
Feeling the fever taking over

// Stop //

So many times we rise and fall
After awhile it's good and all together
Together
So many times we rise and fall
Wondering if we'll find it all together
Together

Baby, but all the nights and days we spent together
(Together)
It's so easy to forget how to surrender
But nothing's ever stopped

Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(Take us to the top)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(But nothing's ever stopped)
So many nights
So many memories

So many times we rise and fall
After awhile it's good and all together
Together
So many ways to lose it all
Livin' with future, we won't have to give up
Together

Baby, but all the nights and days we spent together
Together
It's so easy to forget how to surrender
But nothing's ever stopped

Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(Take us to the top)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(But nothing's ever stopped)
So many nights
So many memories

But nothing's ever stopped
Take us to the top
But nothing's ever stopped

Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(Take us to the top)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(But nothing's ever stopped)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(Take us to the top)
So many nights
So many memories
Music and lines
Rhythm and melodies
(But nothing's ever stopped)
So many nights
So many memories

// Randy //

Get up and shake it up
It's time that you listen up and hear the call
There at the water but at night your're on fire
Back against the wall

Don't stop, try to make your mark
And make your mind up
Don't stop, work it out and try to make it

Randy, get yourself together
Got to get it up to make it better
Randy, you don't have to suffer
Step outside and find yourself a lover

When you know you're alive
When it's time
Don't shoot low
Aim it high
When you know you've arrived
When it's time
Take it slow
Shoot it high

Hold onto what you've got and strike while the iron's hot
Put up a fight
Those days are good and gone
Keep up keep on going strong
All through the night

Don't stop, try to make your mark
And make your mind up
Don't stop, work it out and try to make it

Randy, get yourself together
Got to get it up to make it better
Randy, you don't have to suffer
Step outside and find yourself a lover

When you know you're alive
When it's time
Don't shoot low
Aim it high
When you know you've arrived
When it's time
Take it slow
Shoot it high

Feels like the latest version
Now that the wind is turning soft and cool
Next up a new dimension
Find something fresh and someone just for you

Don't stop, try to make your mark
And make your mind up
Don't stop, work it out and try to make it

Randy, get yourself together
Got to get it up to make it better
Randy, you don't have to suffer
Step outside and find yourself a lover

When you know you're alive
When it's time
Don't shoot low
Aim it high
When you know you've arrived
When it's time
Take it slow
Shoot it high
