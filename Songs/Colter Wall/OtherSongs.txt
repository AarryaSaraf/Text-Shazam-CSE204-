// Bob Fudge //

My name is Bob Fudge I was born in Texas
Lampasas county back during the war
Small pox and Comanches took most of my family
Left my poor mother, my brothers and me

So I headed North to ride for the blockers
They were contracting herds on the Montana range
In the Spring of the year 82 we left old Lampasas
With 2,000 steers for the Little Bighorn

Crossing our trails there were many great rivers
All to be crossed not a bridge would we find
In the cold rolling waters and the wild punching cattle
There was many a young man took leave of his life

Well we crossed at Doan's store into the Indian nation
Saw the blood on the rocks where those cowboys had died
Then it's on Fort Dodge on the Arkansas River
Where gamblers and whores all welcomed us there

And the great snowcapped peaks are on our left side now
For many miles in the great silent land
When I first saw Montana, I knew I would love her
I would ride her great plains til the end of my days

But she's all cut and dry now and the trails are all gone
I've been in Yellowstone Park in an automobile
But I can still see em swimming, boys I can still hear em running
I came off of the trails when cowboys was king

My name is Bob Fudge I died in Montana

// Bury Me Not On The Lone Prairie //

"Oh bury me not on the lone prairie"
These words came slow and mournfully
From the pallid lip of a youth who lay
In his dying bed at the close of day

"Oh bury me not...," and his voice failed there
But they took no heed to his dying prayer
In a narrow grave, just six-by-three
They buried him there on the lone prairie

"Oh bury me not on the lone prairie"
Where the owl of night hoots mournfully
And the blizzard beats and the winds blow free
O'er his lonely grave on the lone prairie

And the cowboys now as they roam the plain
For to marked the spot where his bones were lain
Fling a handful of roses o'er his grave
With a prayer to God for his soul to save

// Cypress Hills And The Big Country //

You can see the bear paws
The old man on his back
Prickly pears, a blue moon
In the short and native grass
There's a bunch of empty beer cans
In an old, loose mineral sack
Give you some idea of where you're at

Buck brush and sage as far as you can see
It's the south slopes of the hills
Turns to pine and poplar trees
Cattle all grazing up and down a big coulee
Under Charley Russel skies
Like a blue and purple sea

Cypress Hills
And the big country below
Where life is still
And a man can be alone
You can duck underneath
All your trials and troubles for a time
Like a pronghorn underneath a bottom wire

Cypress Hills
And the big country below
Where life is still
And a man can be alone
You can duck underneath
All your trials and troubles for a time
Like a pronghorn underneath a bottom wire

You can sweat and cuss and wonder why
They say our west has died
When the folks around the Cypress Hills
Still drag calves to the fire

// Do Re Mi //

Lots of folks back east they say
Leavin' home every day
Beatin' the hot ol' dusty way of the California life

Crossin' the desert sands they rode
Gotta get out of that ol' dust bowl
Think they're goin' to a sugarbowl
But here's what they find

Now the police at the board of entry say
"You're number fourteen thousand for today"
If you ain't got Do Re Mi, boy
You ain't got Do Re Mi

You better go back to beautiful Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee

California is a garden of Eden
She's a paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not, you will find it's so hot
If you ain't got that Do Re Mi

Well you wanna buy a house or farm
That can't do nobody no harm
Take your vacation by the mountains or the sea

Don't swap your old cow for a car
You're better off stayin' right where you are
Better take this little tip from me

As I look through the wanads every day
And the headlines on the papers always say
"If you ain't got Do Re Mi, boy"
"You ain't got Do Re Mi"

You better go back to beautiful Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee

California is a garden of Eden
She's a paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not, you will find it's so hot
If you ain't got that Do Re Mi

// Happy Reunion //

I ride my horse cross the pasture
I jerk my catch twine down
I seen a cow and a sticker in her eye
And I bedded that old hide down
I bedded that old hide down

My horse he knew his business
And he held the rope just right
My dog he's circling round and round
As I pulled that sticker from her eye
Boy get back, I'm pulling a sticker from her eye, you booger

I noticed that she had a tight bag
Her calf nowhere to be found
I told my dog if you want something to do
Go find her calf, bring him back round
Go find her calf boy and bring him back round

He darted over the hillside and he went plum out of sight
When I looked up he was bringing back a calf
Put that calf by his momma's side
Go put that calf right by his momma's side

Well he'd been gone all night
Maybe for more than a day
So he got himself a belly full of milk
Put that calf and his momma on their way
Oh put that calf and his momma on their way

This day in the life of a cowboy
That old darn worlds out spinning round
Me and my dog made a happy reunion when we bedded that old hide down
When we bedded that old hide down

// Let's All Help The Cowboys (Sing The Blues) //

Cowboys they are ladies men alright
They can love 'em up and talk 'em up all night
But they're lonely when there's nothin' else to do
That's what makes the cowboys sing the blues

He does a little Waddie and he sings
He plays the mandolin and other things
He looks for love, beauty and IQ
That's what makes the cowboys sing the blues

Cowboys have to fall in love, get hurt and all that bit
Let their hearts hang out, so they can write you all a hit
So ladies if they ask you don't refuse
Let's all help the cowboys sing the blues

Cowboys they don't ever understand
This thing between a woman and a man
Until they love the one they always lose
That's what makes the cowboys sing the blues

Cowboys have to fall in love, get hurt and all that bit
Let their hearts hang out, so they can write you all a hit
So ladies if they ask you don't refuse
Let's all help the cowboys sing the blues

// Raisin' Cotton //

Cows are in the corn
The feeds all rotten
A new day is born
An ol' one forgotten
The Lord and his plans
Many times I fought 'em
Raisin' cotton, cotton, cotton

For forty long years, I sweat
And I toiled
In the sun I've been seared
Like to wither or boil
I may well have faired better
Drillin' for oil
Raisin cotton, cotton, cotton

Boll weevils in the field
Got me down trodden
Raised hell on my yields
Nearin' rock bottom
Neighbors helpin' hand
Lord knows I wished I'd sought 'em
Raisin' cotton, cotton, cotton
Oh raisin' cotton, cotton, cotton

// You're Lucky She's Lonely //

You're lucky she's lonely. You're lucky she's blue
I'd place your bet on the heart broke brunette
With the Waylon tattoo
She's a maiden of misery
You don't need a white horse or chivalry
So, just make your move
You've got nothing to prove
You're lucky she's blue

You're lucky she's lovesick and nipping along
There's no cure but time for a past love unkind
And a busted up home
She can see through your charm
As you reach for her arm
And lead her up to your room
But keep in mind if you do
You're lucky she's blue

You're lucky she's lonely
And she don't give a damn
You ought to walk over
And just hold out your hand
You can see her left hand
Where there once was a band
You're lucky she's lonely
And she don't give a damn
You're lucky she's lonely
You're lucky she's blue
