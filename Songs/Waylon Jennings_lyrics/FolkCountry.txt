// Another Bridge To Burn //

I've had to burn most every bridge I've crossed
It seems like everything I've loved I'd lost
When I met you I've thought my luck had turned
But our love's just another bridge to burn.

So, I'll soon light the fire and move on
Oh, I've already been here much too long
I'm so hurt and you're so unconcerned
But our love's just another bridge to burn.

Sometimes one must love enough for two
And that's the way it's been with me and you
I'll see your face no matter where I'll turn
But that will be another bridge to burn.

So, I'll soon light the fire and move on
Oh, I've already been here much too long
I'm so hurt and you're so unconcerned
But our love's just another bridge to burn.

Our love's just another bridge to burn...

// Stop The World (And Let Me Off) //

Stop the world and let me off
I'm tired of going round and round
I've played the game of love and lost
So stop the world and let me off.

My dreams're shattered don't you see
Now you no longer care for me
I miss the wonder of your kiss
How could you leave me here like this?

Stop the world and let me off
I'm tired of going round and round
I've played the game of love and lost
So stop the world and let me off.

[Instrumental]

Stop the world and let me off
I'm tired of going round and round
I've played the game of love and lost
So stop the world and let me off...

// Cindy Of New Orleans //

Down by the river where the big boats go by
Each day you could see them as evening was nigh
They planned to be married at the first sign of spring
And Jim would take Cindy to see New Orleans.

The town folks would smile as they sat there alone
Jim talked of the day he'd make Cindy his own
He saved his money to buy her a ring
And take his sweet Cindy to see New Orleans.

[Instrumental]

One day a riverboat gambler chanced by
And captured her heart with his sweet words and lies
He told her come with me and you'll be a queen
So they left together to see New Orleans.

Each day you can see Jim though years have gone by
Down by the river where the big boats go by
She wrote she'd return at the first sign of spring
He's waiting for Cindy to see New Orleans...

// Look Into My Teardrops //

Look into my teardrops
And darling you will see
The reflection of an angel
That made a fool of me.

Look into my teardrops
And you will see the eyes
That promised me so many things
But all of them were lies.

Look into my teardrops
The mirror of my soul
And you will see the girl who
Stilled my only world but I couldn't hold.

Look into my teardrops
And you will see the one
That broke my heart forever
Aren't you proud of what you've done?

[Instrumental]

Look into my teardrops
And you will see the one
That broke my heart forever
Aren't you proud of what you've done?...

// I Don't Mind //

I don't mind, I don't mind
I did for a time but I don't mind.

It used to break my heart each time you cheated
I tried to leave the Lord knows how I tried
But I stay here no matter how I'm treated
And all it really cost me was my pride.
But I don't mind, I don't mind
I did for a time but I don't mind

You and I have a perfect understanding
You come and you go as you please
And I never get too angry or demanding
It's hard to get mad on your knees.
But I don't mind, I don't mind
I did for a time but I don't mind

Once I was strong as a mountain
I stood tall like a giant oak tree
Now my blood runs thin like water in a fountain
You took all the man out of me.
But I don't mind baby, I don't mind
I did for a time but I don't mind...

// Just For You //

Do you ever think about
The one who thinks about you
Do you ever wonder dear
Why he's always waiting here for you?

Inspite of all the things you've said and done
I'm a fool and you're the only one
I'll keep waiting while you'll have your fun, just for you
Can't you see you're a part of me and everything I do?

And every dream I dream is just for you
Do you ever think about the one who thinks about you
Do you ever wonder dear
Why he's always waiting here for you?

It makes no difference what you do or say
I'll be waiting here the same old way
Living every moment of each day
Just for you.

[Instrumental]

It makes no difference what you do or say
I'll be waiting here the same old way
Living every moment of each day
Just for you, just for you, mhm. just for you...

// Now Everybody Knows //

You have made no secret of your new love affair
He buys you pretty presents and he takes you everywhere
You seen him all the places where you and I once went
Sit and hold each other tight in front of all our friends.

Everybody knows, everybody knows why my heart cries.

[Instrumental]

There's no need to tell you you're too in love to see
Anything that I told you you'd call jealousy
But if he ever breaks your heart the way that you broke mine
Just come running back to me you're welcome anytime.

Everybody knows, everybody knows
Why my heart cries
Everybody knows how your love for him grows
While my love dies...

// That's The Chance I'll Have To Take //

Troubles and a worried mind
It seems that's all I've ever known
But now I'll leave that all behind
If you'll just leave me alone.

And if I go on loving you
If to leave is a mistake
If I'm wrong in what I do
That's the chance I'll have to take.

[Instrumental]

Don't bother now to waste the time
Saying things you've said before
I've heard it all a hundred times
But I won't listen anymore.

And if I go on loving you
If to leave is a mistake
If I'm wrong in what I do
That's the chance I'll have to take...

// What Makes A Man Wander //

What makes me wanna roam
When I got so much love at home
What makes a man wander
What makes a man wander?

The whistle of a train
Does something to my brain
What makes a man wander
What makes a man wander?

I know I love you as much as I ever could love anyone
Yet I'm still gone
I come back and I vow to settle down
Now then I'm gone with the dawn.

What makes me wanna roam
When I got so much love at home
What makes a man wander
What makes a man wander?

[Instrumental]

I know I love you as much as I ever could love anyone
Yet I'm still gone
I come back and I vow to settle down
Now then I'm gone with the dawn.

What makes me wanna roam
When I got so much love at home
What makes a man wander
What makes a man wander?

Oh, what makes a man wander
What makes a man wander?...

// Man Of Constant Sorrow //

I'm a man of constant sorrow
I've known trouble all my days
I'll say goodbye and leave tomorrow
And I won't be back this way.

Misery is nothing new to me
Memories will pay in time
Another day some new tomorrow
Just might ease my troubled mind.

I'm a man of constant sorrow
I've known trouble all my days
I'll say goodbye and leave tomorrow
And I won't be back this way.

I can't be the man you've made of me
Only you know how I tried
I'll say goodbye and leave tomorrow
Maybe then you'll be satisfied.

I'm a man of constant sorrow
I've known trouble all my days
I'll say goodbye and leave tomorrow
And I won't be back this way...

// What's Left Of Me //

I've been cheated, mistreated, broken man, defeated
No one wanted or needed any part of me
I've been bothered and shattered till my heart's torn and tattered
Baby, are you sure you want what's left of me?

I've been busted, disgusted, hurt by those I trusted
There's a big old hurt inside where my heart should be
I've been lied on and cried on, cheated on and spited on
Even dogs think that I'm a tree
Baby, are you sure you want what's left of me?

I've been rocked on and socked on, this heart of mine's been tread on
I been cryin' so long my eyes can hardly see
I've been bad lucked, half crocked till my mind is shell shocked
Baby, are you sure you want what's left of me?

I've been busted, disgusted, hurt by those I trusted
There's a big old hurt inside where my heart should be
I've been lied on and cried on, cheated on and spited on
Even dogs think that I'm a tree
Baby, are you sure you want what's left of me?...
