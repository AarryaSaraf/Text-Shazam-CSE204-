Album: TheBigDay

// All Day Long //

[Chance the Rapper:]
Yup
And we back (Igh)
Na-na-na (Igh)

If you blink you might miss it
You gotta click it or ticket
You gotta go get to gettin' before it's gone
End it quickly as it begun
Life is short as a midget, but mine's a little LeBron
Been a minute, since Eminem was a blonde
I need a peace prize, mom, invented the bomb
A nigga wanted more, I would only sit on the lawn
A nigga up next like Charlize scented colognes
I'm 'bout to book a show at the Dimmsdale Dimmadome
I still could hit up Sony today and get a loan
And shout out to Miss Sylvia Rhone, we get along
But that boy advance gotta be bigger than Diddy Kong
I need stock and it gotta be Pippy Long
Can't stop, won't stop boppin' like Diddy's song
My next tour, it got eight legs like daddy long
I'm 'bout to have two kids that like daddy's song

[John Legend:]
We can't be out here pleasin' everybody (Oh, I...)
We know who we are (Oh, yeah)
And if you with me, then I'm with you darlin' (Yeah)
Baby, all day long (Come on, come on)
Baby, all day long (Oh, I...)
Baby, all day long (Yeah)
Baby, all day long

[Chance the Rapper:]
This is, this is the day
Took it the scenic route, but this is the way
That's old news, baby, this is today
They gon' miss us today, you a missus today
This is, this is the day
Took it the scenic route, but this is the way
That's old news, baby, this is today
They gon' miss us today, you a missus today

Backyard blasted, dance 'til it's grassless
Patio glass, the mazel tov cocktails
Bomb, b-bombastic, used to drop acid
Marley come soon, I only drop classics
Everyone ask when that heat gon' drop
When that knee gon' drop, when is he gon' pop
The question we all got, 'cause this could be our block
You're livin' in a glass house, we can see y'all clocks
But I can see you from the other side, see y'all rocks
And we could've been Magneto, if you see our locks
But we share with the world, not just fans
Come out clean lookin' like we jumped the broom and the dustpan
So now we're scared and we actin' out
Dame Dash champagne, in the back a towel
Now I'm back in my bag and the cat is out
Burn a hole in my pocket like a Black & Mild (Ah)

[John Legend:]
We can't be out here pleasin' everybody (Oh, I...)
I know, you know, we know just who we are (Oh, yeah)
And if you with me, then I'm with you darlin' (Oh, baby)
Baby, all day long (Come on, come on)
Baby, all day long (Oh, I...)
Baby, all day long (Yeah)
Baby, all day long (Oh, I...)

Hey, we made it, we made it
I'm feelin' grateful
I'm here with my favorite
Oh God, I'm thankful
Our song and we played it
So good, we played it (Yeah)
I just wanted to keep on playin' (Hey)
We made it, we made it
I'm feelin' grateful
I'm here with my favorite
Oh God, I'm thankful
Our song and we played it
So good, we played it (Yeah)

Baby, all day long (Come on, come on)
Baby, all day long (Oh, I...)
Baby, all day long (Yeah)
Baby, all day long
Baby, all day long

// Do You Remember //

Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappeared into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

I remember the summer Lil' Chano got ahold of his household
The same summer that widowed Gwyneth Paltrow
Back when I could trust in my dogs like Balto
My family The Sopranos these niggas is altos
First album, every track could be the outro
Velcro, the shelltoes
Things that we will outgrow
Used to rock South Pole, summers taking the 6 bus to South Shore
Never sold out but now we out-sold
That was the summer I learned to love the great outdoors
Learned you get the fans if you can't keep yo mouth closed
That summer left a couple marks like Groucho
That halo can turn hollow, depending how low
That summer left a couple tan lines
I love my city they let me cut the line on the damn ride
They walk on eggshells and landmines
They communicate with handsigns

Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Day disappeared into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappeared into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

I remember the last summer of the teens
I can't recall too many summers in between
Will Smith, Genie, Donald Glover, Lion King
My daughter on the swing like the 2017 Cubs
My daughter mother double-ringed up
Finger look like jean cuffs, or two lean cups
Used to have obsession with the 27 club
Now I'm turning 27 wanna make it to the 2070 club
Put the 27s down lord give me a clean love
Took the ring up out the box I know this ain't no pre-fluff
This story arc so sharp that it made the streets flood
This the type of covenant you keep love, deep love

Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappeared into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever (Summer everlasting)
Days disappeared into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

// Eternal //

Side chicks can't dance like this, uh
Side niggas can't dance like this, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Side niggas can't step like this, uh-uh
Side niggas can't stamp like this, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah (You know what time it is), yeah, yeah, yeah

What you know about this? This before your time
I used to two-step in the 019
I always been fine, this is not new wine
I just happened to find a way to live my whole life in my prime
Side niggas don't look this good, can't cook this good
Can't fuck this good, can't get right
You send him to the store and forget that he left
You send me to the store, I come back with a chef
I'll come back out of breath
While your side nigga sittin' at the club with a booty on his chin like a cleft
I don't never want two that's the same as the next
I made the three more famous than Steph
No cap, that's a roundhouse kick to a Jameson's neck
I got a Jada Pinkett keeping sure my shame is in check
Cross-legged in the dojo, my master, mentor
Side chicks can't take out splinters
Side chicks make they Kool-Aid with Splenda
Side chicks can't come to Auntie Linda's house
They gon' send her off, they gon' send her out
To buy more things that they hid in the couch
Don't you know that side niggas can't cop no Tesla?
Pull up in a ring like wrestlers
Pop out at the soccer game with the VVS's and a bunch of snacks
Model X Falcon, backseat, doing jumping jacks
20-1-9, I want it one of a kind
2020, I'ma be ahead of my time
Twenty thousand leagues, the biggest fish in the pond
But if you never go fishing, it's something you'll never find

We can be (Eternal), eternal (Forever and ever)
We can be (Eternal), eternal (Eternal, baby, we can be eternal, baby)

I know some shawties that'll blast for me over blasphemy
And throw that ass for me, show my last to sleep
Huh, slow motion so I had to see
Before you start, fill my glass, wipe my glasses
I love her passion, ooh (Sweet)
I drank my passionfruit (Sweet)
I'm runnin' through your organs like when I pass the hoop
I wanna pass the ball, I don't pass the ball
I'm Kobe, baby, I ate it up
I ain't ate all month, you lookin' like a plate of lunch
Sentiment was edgy if she let her get stoned
Almost fell in love, I hurt my heart from these songs
Terminally known, she can feel it in the stones
Now she giving me ultimatums
I told her I hate tomatoes, some chances, I gotta take 'em
I can't see for the life of me
Why all these hoes like me when I got wifey
Side chicks can't do flat twists
Bet a dollar you could buy me a Brisk (Yeah, yeah)
Side chicks can't cook no grits
Grits, nigga, grits

We can be (Eternal), eternal (Forever and ever)
We can be (Eternal), eternal (Eternal, baby, we can be eternal, baby)

Side chicks can't dance like this, uh
Side niggas can't dance like this, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Side niggas can't step like this, uh-uh
Side niggas can't stamp like this, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh yeah)

// Hot Shower //

[Intro:]
Yup, yup, yerp
And then the smoke got me
Hey

[Chance the Rapper:]
I got muscles like Superman's trainer (Ooh)
Real real rare like Super Saiyan manga
I jump stomp-stomp on Lucifer, Satan
Now I got a few rings on, Jupiter skating
I meant to say Saturn, switched up the pattern
Smoking on some shatter (Ooh), got me higher than a ladder (Ooh)
Thanks I'm flattered, my baby mama badder
You look like Mick Jagger, oops, the grease splattered
Ooh, ooh, hot, hot (Ooh)
Jumping out the grease
It's a whole lotta degrees
'Bout to come up out the fleece, fleece, fleece
Shh, I don't wanna hear a peep (Skrr)
Tryna catch some sleep, tryna count some sheep

Hot damn, hot water, hot shower
Hotlanta, smoking green, cauliflower
Tangerine, yeah, I call her sweet and sour
And my lawyer say it's urgent, I'ma call him in a hour

Dude, I just called the plug and his phone was unplugged
I was lookin' at Doug like "Ooh, ooh, ooh"
Dude, that shit don't even make no fucking sense
Like having fuckin' arguments for payin' 50 extra cents for barbecue
Saucing on the workers at McDonald's
I don't wanna sit and argue, Good Burger shoulda taught you
We all dudes
And I'm all professional and proper
But my baby mama stopped me in a meeting (Skrrt, skrrt)
Just to Airdrop me some nudes

Hot damn, hot water, hot shower
Hotlanta, smoking green, cauliflower (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tangerine, yeah, I call her sweet and sour
And my lawyer say it's urgent, I'ma call him in a hour

[MadeinTYO:]
Yeah, hopped off the flight, Louis V, Off-White (Ooh)
I just met a doll bet she tryna spend the night
Heard they need more, yeah, my jeans Dior (Ooh)
Shawty got cake if you tryna eat more
Think they need more, I think they need more (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
This is a second run, I'm tryna speed more (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Chopped and screwed, Michael Watts (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Point 'em out, air 'em out (Skrrt, skrrt)
Get me right, sippin' Sprite (Skrrt, skrrt)
180, half pipe (Skrrt, skrrt)
Ooh

[Chance the Rapper:]
Hot damn, hot water, hot shower
Hotlanta, smoking green, cauliflower
Tangerine, yeah, I call her sweet and sour
And my lawyer say it's urgent, I'ma call him in a hour

[DaBaby:]
Got damn, think I got a new lawsuit, I need to come see you (What's that?)
I got a new whip, you know what a car do, turn a bitch to a eater (Mmm, mmm)
She said we don't got enough room to get freaky in here
'Cause it's just a two seater (Okay, question)
Am I still considered a jerk if I get her a hoopty and buy me a Beamer? (Uh-uh)
I had a new case but the judge had to throw it out, my lawyer beat it like Tina
I always find a way to get ahead with my intelligence when they critique my demeanor (Ha)
Today I just signed to Republic (What else?)
And go get some head from a white man's daughter
Here lips ain't big but I'm loving it
I get in, fake ID, I'm McLovin' it
Beat the BNT like the government (What?)
Except for the cops, mission impossible
Strapped with the Glock, Danny Gloverin'
Tip a hunnid if you let my cousin in
You know everybody my cousin (Cause)
Oh yeah and I gotta be thuggin' it
'Cause my hair can get nappy as fuck
And wear jewelry and I got that chocolate coloring

Well at least, like you know, that's what they make me feel like
Why they make you feel like that
I don't know, I mean it's America right?

[Chance the Rapper:]
Ooh, hot damn, hot water, hot shower
Hotlanta, smoking green, cauliflower (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tangerine, yeah, I call her sweet and sour
And my lawyer say it's urgent, I'ma call him in a hour

// We Go High //

Yeah
(We love you, we love, we love you, God)
(We lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love you, God)
(We love you, love you, love you, God)
(We lo-lo-love you, we love you, God)
(We love you, God, we love you, God, we love you, God)

My baby mama went celibate
Lies on my breath, she say she couldn't take the smell of it
Tired of the rumors, every room had an elephant
Tryna find her shoes, rummagin' through the skeletons
She took away sex, took me out of my element
I tried to do the single-dad mingle-dance
At the club with the iron in my wrinkled pants
You could fall much faster than you think you can
Big hands for my ring, I'ma need a Pringles can
I just want the shine back like a Eagles fan
My ego like "Ah damn, there he go
Prayin' again, again, the same ol' thang"
I mean, I ain't gon' promise that the pain go away
And you can take your sweet time, but she ain't gon' wait
'Cause a new coat of paint don't make the stain go away
But he go high (We love you, God)
And we go high
They go low, we go...
Higher, higher

My wife nanny like Fran Drescher
Three damn Grammys, my granny like, "No pressure"
So much style, my stylist got no dresser
Fuck goin' straight to the pros, I'm professor
Fuck bein' one of the G.O.A.T.s, I'm Gotenks
Tried to try that with my girl, she "No thanks"
Dropped the bomb, I couldn't find a Tom Hanks
Got me pressed, tryin' to find a Von Frank
Who the fuck rocked the boat? It's gon' sank
Shootin' at me point blank with those blanks
They don't take teenage angst at no banks
(We love you, God)
Tried some new hues like Langston gon' paint
You gotta come harder than that

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
It's two different things
It's too bad, and it's so sad
It's too bad, and it's so sad
It's two things (We love you, God)
It's too bad, and so sad

We give the glory to you, God
One livin' true God, he make us booyah
And throw up the Wu like U-God
They prop up statues and stones, try to make a new God
I don't need a EGOT, as long as I got you, God
Deep breathe, the woosah
Pretty sure I need you in this season like a flu shot
I just sit and wait like I'm with Kirsten when she shoe shop
Know you always with me like how Diddy be with Blue Dot
Got us movin' 'round without the straps like a tube-top
Got me big comfy like Molly's couch
Floatin' 'round the city like Malcolm X, Dali'd out
They highly doubt, I guarantee it
This the part of my life my lifetime movie prolly 'bout
When they come to jump a board, I won't ollie out
I too was once a snotty nose with a potty mouth
One day you get 1 OAK, then poppied out
And poppin' out don't seem as popular as just passin' out
When time get rationed out, you get rational
Folks become pageants inside the fashion house
They start to clash and you let 'em hash it out
But stay passive, so if they crash, you got a fastened belt (Huh)
Lord bless my lineage, let me be the skinniest
Let me get some time with him, let him know who Kenny is
Children born in one's youth are like arrows in the hands of a warrior
Well, I got an extendo with a long nose like Phineas
Kids proud like Penny is
BeBe & CeCe, I need like 20 twins
Got her in my family like Indian
Feel it in your gut like when you uppercut Ballchinians
Speakin' of guts, hers pokin' out like Winnie in the red shirt
I don't have to teach you a lecture about how sex works
I found out diamonds make pressure
I used to dive head first, just know I had to let go of the flesh first
It's true, God, this union was for you, God
We standin' at the at the stoop, we want to make it to the rooftop
You told us bring some people through, we tried to bring a few, God
We tried to form a new bar, just tell us what to do, God

// I Got You (Always And Forever) //

[Ari Lennox:]
Five, six, seven
I got you, you've got me
I don't care what people might say
I know you know
I've got you
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chance the Rapper:]
Do it for the 1-9 love, 1-9
For the 1-9, for the 1-9 love
Do it for the 1-9
We do it, we do it for the 1-9 love

[Ari Lennox:]
Around the world, people tend to lend advice
We can't blame them, it's all just by design
Take it all with a grain of sand
Or leave it all up to me, I got you always

Always, always and forever
Always, always and forever
Always, always and forever
Always, always and forever
Always, always and forever
Always, always and forever
Always, always and forever
Always, always

[Chance the Rapper (Ari Lennox):]
We do it for the 1-9 love, 1-9
For the 1-9, for the 1-9 love
Do it for the 1-9
We do it, we do it for the 1-9 love
We do it for the 1-9
(Ooh, I've got you, oh-oh-oh)

[Chance the Rapper:]
Ayy, call me Young Mister, Mister Tongue Twister
Niggas couldn't touch the flow if they was playing Twister, right
A minute of that, they turn to Sonny Liston, right
It's funny, you're pullin' up, I'm gettin' blisters
Ever since I kissed her
Everyone seem like they got something to say
Like the day after the big day
Is supposed to be super bad like we won't stay
It's supposed to be super scary like we don't pray
We treat the bad advice like bad breath
Either give a compliment or couple mints, depends what we have left
Find the good news in the bad press
Tell 'em break a leg like an actress, hit with a jab step
1-9 love, that's forever, it'll never stop
1-9 Love, that's a record I'll never drop, uh
1-9 love, that's a one time love
That's a one time, one time, every time it'll be the
Lot of folks share they opinions
Same folks so easy offended
One thing I'll always remember
They here today, but we'll be together forever

[Ari Lennox (Chance the Rapper):]
Around the world, people tend to lend advice
We can't blame them, it's all just by design
Take it all with (Take it all with), a grain of sand
Or leave it all up to me (Leave it all up to me), I got you always

[Chorus - Ari Lennox (Chance the Rapper)::]
Always, always (and forever, ever)
Always, always (and forever, ever)
Always, always (and forever, ever)
Always, always (and forever, ever)
Always, always (and forever, ever)
Always, always (and forever, ever)
Always, always (and forever, ever)
Always, always {I got you, oh-oh-oh}

[Chance the Rapper:]
It's been a minute, I've been messin' with ya, I could never switch up
Turn my life around, I'm tryna go to Heaven with ya
I would sit there in the waiting room together with ya
Magazines, pat my jeans, have a beverage with ya
Count my blessings with ya
They prefer success less than when we stress, bet
Forget about all the drama and the comments they left
All rightly mine, the bottom line is right on top of they text
You gotta remember that thy enemy is not of the flesh
You gotta remember that our imagery is made from the best
So pray for the best
Hands high, got the guard up, caught the Hail Mary
Mary tossed the 'Ville, moved to Fort Lauderdale
1-9 to 9-1, that's the goal
9-1 dash, that's the soul
Can't keep track of lies that they told
So extra in the background, that's they role, but
Lot of folks share they opinions
Same folks so easy offended
One thing I'll always remember
They here today, but we'll be together forever

[Ari Lennox (Chance the Rapper):]
Around the world, people tend to lend advice
We can't blame them, it's all just by design
Take it all with (Take it all with), a grain of sand
Or leave it all up to me, I got you always

[Ari Lennox (Chance the Rapper):]
Always, always (and forever, ever)
Always, always (and forever, ever)
Always, always (and forever, ever)
Always, always (and forever, ever)
Always, always (and forever, ever)
Always, always (and forever, ever)
Always, always (and forever, ever)
Always, always

[Ari Lennox:]
I got you, you've got me
I don't care what people might say
I know you know
I've got you always

// Photo Ops (Skit) //

Look that way, nigga
(Do somethin')
Pussy ass nigga
You watch out
Oh, yo, yo
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Let me in, in, in

Ah yeah, woo
Y'all look great
Why y'all stop?
Don't quit on the count of me
This picture be developed in two or three minutes
Go ahead, you got your shirt all wrinkled
And you... your eye is fucked up, damn
I guess I should've seen this comin' but I
This isn't how I pictured this day
You boys sure love to fight, all the time
All you do is fight, fight, fight
What you fighting over now? Money? (Man I...)
Shut up, ain't nobody ask you nothin', fat boy
Goodness
These two are brothers, you're family
This isn't what family looks like
Now, I came here to get a photo of my boys on their big day
Now, we could wait for this picture to develop and remember today looking like this
Or, we can go out and try this again
Go fix yourselves up
Fat boy, move in, somebody can try to put their arm around you
Come on... everyone...

(Come on, man)

// Roo //

[CocoRosie:]
Heard the stage calling in the distance

[Chance the Rapper:]
It was all us crammed in the house
Back when my dad was the man of the house
A lot of dads left, they abandoned the house
My dad Joe Jack start a band in the house
He said one friend, one friend in the house
Only one friend in the whole wide world
One day will come when you only have each other
Never give it up for a boy or a girl

We come in peace but we don't come in pieces
We on some tag-team WWE shit
We look just alike, the prestige is so prestigious
The splitting image of Lupita standing on them beaches
Don't tweak and don't be facetious
Those shells'll shred you to pieces
These niggas faking like demons
But I'ma send 'em to Jesus
This is me and my bro
Versus all of you heathens
They think I'm reading Ephesians
I have all these niggas hiding, avoiding meetings like vegans
I got the keys like I'm Keegan
I'll line the trunk with the bleach
And I'll leave you inside the freezer and let you chill for the weekend
But forget over the weekend and come back inside a month
And I throw you inside the trunk but it's plastic so it ain't leakin'
But we can be cool
We can be cool
Me and my brother
We can be cruel
Find your ass
Line your ass up
Go to work on 'em

[CocoRosie:]
Hear the stage calling in the distance

[Taylor Bennett:]
It's a lot more crammed in the house
Back when Chance was the man of the house
Baseball bats if they ran in the house
We from out south like birds in the clouds
When I was 11, heard my homie dad died
This shit deeper than music, I got PTS for life
So if you do production just make sure the drums right
The independent Bennetts will never need your advice
Our image won't diminish 'cause Charlie and Marley right
Me and Chano like Peschi and Robin's life
A made man, we just makin' the songs right
You just makin' the song hype
I really snapped, the last time I rapped I was movin' packs
In adolescence, seen ambulances, learned other lessons
Catchin' blessings, overstretchin' from first-hand impressions
Chano called my phone voicemail, hope he don't get a message
Heard that I exit from my axis off that intersection
So if you say somethin' 'bout big bro, bitch, I'ma smack you reckless
We from down south, we bogus twice and we are not from Texas
One more rep, can't run around strapped, so I walk around like pedestrian
Chi-town summer lookin' like my numbers, and you know how I'm bomin', ain't checkin it
Called big bro, now we run it up, set it up, get it up, nigga, now let's begin
OTF, free Durk and them
We was inside with a curfew then
What's fire without earth and wind?
And what's a fight when it's worth the win? Yeah

// The Big Day //

[Francis and the Lights:]
I can't believe it
Must be the luckiest guy alive
Somehow, I'm right
But we're only gonna survive if we go crazy
Yeah the only way to survive is to go

[Chance the Rapper:]
Oh my God, think it's the greatest day of my life
So glad you arrived
But the only way to survive is to go crazy
Yeah, the only way to survive is to go crazy

Oh my God, think it's the greatest day of my life
So glad you arrived
But the only way to survive is to go crazy
Yeah, the only way to survive is to go crazy

Oh my God, think it's the greatest day of my life
So glad you arrived
But the only way to survive is to go crazy
Yeah, the only way to survive...

Fuck money, shit, fuck, shit, tell 'em, burn it
I don't wanna, get it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck it
Fuck it
Yeah, uh, uh
Still wanna, drink it, fuck it, drink it, drink it, fuck it, shoot it
I don't wanna, just get it, get it, get it, get it
(That shit is so hard)
Oh, Lord

[Chance the Rapper:]
Oh my God, think it's the greatest day of my life (Oh, Lord)
So glad you arrived
[Chance the Rapper & Francis and the Lights:]
But the only way to survive is to go crazy
Yeah, the only way to survive...

[Francis and the Lights:]
In a simulation
This is the only part I like
Or I might just be a molecule of Christ
Folding in a universe of dust and light
Or maybe we're just molecules in the body of Christ

// Let's Go On The Run //

[Chance the Rapper:]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Hey there, lovely sister
Won't you come home to your mister?
I've got plans to hug and kiss ya
I've got plans to hug and hug and hug you
Let's go on the run (Ooh, ooh)
Let's go on the run
It's time to hit the road
We got one place to go (Ooh, ooh)

Greaseproof, meep-meep, I feel like Road Runner
I get my feet loose
I got that Superman hidden under my jean suit
Sittin', just waitin' for Lois to wanna leave too, me too
I swear we gotta get away anywhere that we can
Just meet me by the water, I'll be there with the sand
And if it goes left, that's according to plan
Sometimes you gotta chuck the wagon off at the bend

[Knox Fortune:]
She broke up with her boyfriend
The people wanna know what he said
They wanna know the way how
You can break her heart like that
Do you know I could see someone with personality?
Someone who doesn't think like me
Someone who doesn't feel like me
I wanna run away now
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
I wanna run away now
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
(Check, check, check)
Ch-Check it out

[Chance the Rapper:]
Baby, we dippin', tell me who's whippin'
Let's beat the traffic, give it a whippin'
These niggas lame
They think they different
With all that extra ass advice but don't nobody listen
Baby, I'll keep it in ice but we don't need a tip in
That's why you passed on open mic when I was only pimpin'
I say we move down to Atlanta, get a big ol' house
With a giant pair of Timbs just to kick folks out
Get outta here
Ain't nobody talkin' to you (Ooh, ooh)
And be unbothered (Ooh, ooh)
And be unbothered
We'll move farther and farther and farther away (Yeah)

Hey there, lovely sister
Won't you come home to your mister?
I've got plans to hug and kiss ya
I've got plans to hug and hug and hug you
Let's go on the run (Ooh, ooh)
Let's go on the run
It's time to hit the road
We got one place to go (Ooh, ooh)

(Ooh)
Ooh, ooh

Don't hyperventilate
Keep the lyric cool like Cole Bennett Lemonande
The boy got aluminum foil on his dinner plate
Lot of my time, lattes when it's gettin' late
The mattress just can't inflate
Walk out like a zombie from the stu' and assimilate
Humans to simulate
Went into the bed close the lights and dim the drapes
Always Matt Damon when you come Jimmy Kimmel late
Tryna fill the shoes Nick Cannon wear, rental skates
Piss like urinal cakes
I'm ready, I'm finna take the long ride home like the end of a limo date
Rolled the window down so hard that the window break
And toss out my demo tape

Ooh, ooh

// Handsome //

[Chance the Rapper:]
Baby, I look good, I look handsome

Houston hottie with a model body

// Big Fish //

[Gucci Mane:]
Uh

[Chance the Rapper:]
Birdman handrub
This shit fit me like a damn glove
Shit cleaner than a hand scrub
Feel better than DJ Khaled fan love
This the rock that gave pride to a man cub
Ain't no love in hip-hop
There ain't no keepin' up with the Bennetts
Ain't no diamonds in the chain but it's in the pendant
I only own fishbowls, but my rentals tinted
You know I'm used to movin' units like rental tenant
Real lieutenant, God's army
He like a doctor, he'll never let me shot harm me
I'm a force in the field, I never take damage
I create panic 'cause niggas wanna act fake satanic
And the labels get straight frantic
Their boiler rooms look like eight Channing Tatum's and a Peyton Manning
And they all been married
They celebrate anniversaries and nurseries and try to play Santa
But they don't sell marriage no more
Guess bein' all alone ain't so scary no more (Guess not)
Guess our lives ain't for sharin' no more
Guess the tale can't end like a fairy no more, but...

[Chance the Rapper (Gucci Mane):]
I swear my story just like big fish
I've seen hoes, I was always just like "Which? Which?"
One day, big catch, hit the bait and switch switch
I was on the line, I became the big fish, yeah
I swear my story just like big fish
I've seen hoes, I was always just like "Which? Which?"
One day, big catch, hit the bait and switch switch (Uh)
I was on the line, I became the big fish, yeah

[Gucci Mane:]
Anything is possible if Gucci can do it (It's Gucci)
Tractor trailer full of kush, bet Gucci could move it
Used to drive a Buick, now a Rolls Royce (Right)
I'm the young hoes' choice that make the old hoes moist
All these niggas separate all the men from the boys
All these wars I went through, felt like soldier deployed
I'm the trap God but I give the glory to God
It's a knife on my K and my tongue is a sword
I'm the plug and the cord, get it all in accord
White rings seasick, Gucci went overboard
Hublot surfboard, brought sand to the beach
All white tux on, brought the church to the streets (It's Gucci)

Yeah, Chance the Rapper, Guwop the Trapper
Huh, we just out here leadin' by example
Yeah, stand for something and fall for anything
Kings and Queens

[Chance the Rapper:]
I swear my story just like big fish
I've seen hoes, I was always just like "Which? Which?"
One day, big catch, hit the bait and switch switch
I was on the line, I became the big fish, yeah
I swear my story just like big fish
I've seen hoes, I was always just like "Which? Which?"
One day, big catch, hit the bait and switch switch
I was on the line, I became the big fish, yeah

// 4 Quarters In The Black (Skit) //

[Keith David:]
You damn right, we doin' good
We just had four consecutive quarters in the black
You kiddin' me?
Hey, wait a minute, where you goin'?
Come he- no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Come here, co-
Before you do, before you do all that, come here
Let me talk to him for a minute
Y'all know I'm proud of him, right?
As a matter of fact
Excuse me, excuse me, uh, uh
GarÃ§on, yeah, boy I'm talkin' to you
Come here, give me one of them things
You old enough to drink, ain't ya?
Now, you know I got to do this
I'd like to make a toast to this young man
Come on, give it up, ladies and gentlemen
Give it up, come on, hahahahaha
Look at him, this is the future
This is a guy who literally never ceases to surprise me
The decisions he makes
Are not necessarily the decisions I would have made
Or anybody with some sense
But what I can say is: the boy is fearless
He's ambitious and he's a honest man
Look, he's grown, really
Got his lady with him, makin' himself a lil' money, look like
We see the success, but what's next?
I mean, we're proud
But you can't just pack it all up and start all over
It works here 'cause you got us
The support here is what made ya
This boy's a prime example, hm
Of countin' your eggs before they hatch
Got a lil' lucky, now he up and ready to take over the whole globe
Look at him, the kid's got big, big plans
And I hope they all work out, I really do
But do you ever really think about how it's s'posed to all work out?
Do you have health insurance? A retirement plan?
And you need to start savin' money, right? Huh?
Uh, and he gon' need a car
And you need to pay me that money you owe me
And you need a wife
And you need Jesus
Oh, and you need to be a vegan
Don't forget about that veganism, that's that 2019, it's almost 2020
(And you need a credit card)
You need to stop doin' that Percy pill
(And he gon' need a car)

// 5 Year Plan //

You gotta schedule vacations in your five year plan
You gotta schedule celebrations in your five year plan
You gon' have several revelations in your first five days
In your first five minutes, have your first five fans
For like 45 minutes, take your first shift break
There's no time for impatience in your five year plan
You got time for hesitation in your five year plan
A lot of shit came at you in a five year span
If you followed your flight plan, you'd be right here prayin'
Eyes closed, right now sayin', Lord of Lords
I know you gave abundantly, even gave up your son for me
No need for sacrifice in my plans
And I love to say your name, it come from my diaphragm
I just had to scare 'em off and draw a line in the sand
Anything you gave to me, they couldn't pry from my hands
Anything you gave to me, I know it's right for my brand
I know shortcuts cut short long runs
I seen niggas on one try to wrong one
Get drunk, sing the same song, Kung Jong Swon
Giant mistakes on fee fi foe numb
Got to keep on thumb
You got time for misteppin'
Time for them weapons
Form but not prosper
Time for them lessons
Time for them blessings
Time for first, second
Third, fourth impressions
Time for reflection
Time for confession
Time will heal all
Let's get up, get stretchin'

Things that's in the way of my goal
Things that eat away at my heart
That's just, just the way of the art
I know that I had a good start
I wish I could play a guitar
I, I know that I'm gonna be
Better than I ever was
I told 'em they gonna see
I just want every bottle
Love, love, love

Time has, time has come
Time has, time has come
To be who you are
Be who you are
Time has, time has come
Time has come
To take it all in, take it all in
Take it all in
The time has come
Time has come, time has come
Know who you are
Know who you are
The time has come
Time has come, time has come
To take it all in

Who's that in the back of the back?
You deserve a plaque and a pat on the back
I see y'all in your Seuss like the Cat in the Hat
With the clean black slacks and the jacket to match
Found your way back like a Cadillac with the flats
Came around like satellite, down like a battle axe
Why do you word insure me like it's Aflac?
I don't know, why do birds Burt Bacharach?
Why do worms prefer habitats?
Why did it occur where it happened at?
Why ain't no apples in Apple Jacks?
Are you ready for The Big Day?
I don't know, but you're well on your way

Somebody hurt you really bad
And you don't know what to do
And you think how so many people live through things like this
Sounds crazy but it's true
You can get over anything, almost
I'm telling you the truth
The one thing left to say is...

// Get A Bag //

[Chance The Rapper:]
(Tellin' you now, now you're my only one)

Ayy, ayy, I pull up in that Elon, all these niggas felines
I stopped smokin' cigarettes, now pussy taste like key lime
Big ol' Birkin bag she could lean on like a crutch
She said, "Babe, if it's too crazy, that.380 in my clutch"
I say, "Yah, you know you my favorite shooter"
Yah, bing-bing-bang-booka-booka
Yah, we gon' keep it out of court
We run plays, this shit a sport
We some Gs, we don't want want pork
Beat go crazy, make it work, work, work
Shorty way too bad, she want a bag, not no purse
Screamin', "Fuck the other grass"
She want that gas and not that dirt
She want that cash and I'm like Turk
I want that cash, and she like work, work, work

I'm just tryna get to it in a new way
With the band on a beeper or the two-way
We could get on the Venmo, what's to it?
We could run just together, what's to it?

When you want a bag, you get a bag
You need a bag, you get a bag
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh (Go get it, go get it, go get it)
You want a bag, you get a bag (A bag)
You need a bag, you get a bag (Bag)
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh (Go get it, go get it, go get it)
You need a bag

[CalBoy:]
I know I gotta get this money 'til my dyin' soul
By the low, I come from the trenches, we was by the store
Baby, no, I don't wanna buy your love, but my heart is cold
Gotta roll, all my homies old and I keep 'em close
Lucid dream, ridin' that hemi thing, swear I do the most
Brand new fiend, she drink anything, she might need a Coke
Never sleep, gotta get to this bag, I ain't goin' broke
Wanna kick it with me, but I ain't got no legs, I been on the go
I don't go with no plan, better stick with your plan
Did you hear what I said? I don't know what you sayin'
And you know I'm the man, let's get to the deads
Let's get to some bread, better hop out in your bag

[Chance The Rapper:]
When you want a bag, you get a bag
You need a bag, you get a bag
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh (Go get it, go get it, go get it)

// Sun Come Down //

I let the sun come down
Without telling you exactly what I mean
And you might never know
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I let the sun come down
I let the sun come down
I let the sun come down without letting you know exactly what I mean
Exactly what you mean to me
Yeah
Yeah, yeah

Please don't let my death be about my death
Please don't make no movies about my death
Please make my death about my life
If you make a movie 'bout my life, make it right
Please don't make no holograms, don't wanna do it twice
You wanna use my likeness, please approve it through my wife
And if you get the license then you better use it right
Don't misconstrue my offerings to offer new advice
If I said it, I meant it
If I'm dead, it's cemented
And send the black cemeteries already ascended
I'll leave you my last name I left on the last plane
Too much baggage but you can carry on Bennett
I just wanna make sure that my words touch you
Pinky swear and kiss it
Promise no one'll hush you
Jump and hit the blocks, I promise you'll see the mushrooms
Clouds in the dust soon
Leavin' more thoughts than there are bristles on a brush broom

I let the sun come down
I let the sun come down
And you might never know
I let the sun come down
I let the sun come down
I let the sun come down without letting you know exactly what I mean
Exactly what you mean to me

7 PM thoughts in my home
Who to put in my will, who to put in my won't
Some people my blood, some people my flesh
That's the difference 'tween catch and fetch
I don't want nobody to be at my wedding
That won't be there for my marriage
They can see that shit on Facebook
They can like it, they can share it
Like look at that lil' dress and how she wear it
I thought that pregnant belly prolly tear it
You know they only did this shit for money
I know one day that they just co-co-parent
I gotta zoom in, count up all the carats
I know that nigga probably went to Jared
I know that nigga probably so embarrassed
But they don't know nothin', baby
That's why I tell you when I say it, I say
Don't look down, don't look down
When they, when they try and make up all that bullshit
I just tell you
Don't look down, don't look down
And when we goin' towards the sky, when we get into that atmosphere
Don't look down, don't look down
And when they go into the comments, we like a comet
Don't look down, don't look down
Don't look down

Turn the fur to the Nair, it's a thousand degrees, set it free

// Town On The Hill //

Thought I didn't know you
You thought I didn't know you
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
We never take you outside
You never turn a crazy thing down
We never take you outside
You never turn a crazy thing down
You thought I didn't know you
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
I didn't owe you anything, gave you

They built a town on top of a hill
Yellow in hue, standing in plain sight
This caught my eye and spoke to my soul
"What a good deed," I said

Thank you, Father, Father
Thank you, Father, Father

They built a town on top of a hill
Yellow in hue, 'cause it was busting with light
And that's when I caught a view, what a magnificent sight
'Cause it reminds me of You, I guess

Thank you, Father, Father
You really love me
You really love me
Father, Father (Down)
You really love me

Down
We never take you outside
You never turn a crazy thing down
We never take you outside
You never turn a crazy thing down
You thought I didn't know you
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
You thought I didn't know your worth
I didn't owe you anything, gave you

// Our House (Skit) //

[Woman (Little Girl):]
Hello?
Yeah, girl, I'm still at this damn wedding
I know, I know
Shit, divorces don't even take this long
Hey, slow down
Ooh, hold on, girl, let me call you back
Ahh, they done left the little one
Hey, pretty girl
Did them little bad butt kids leave you behind, baby?
(Um)
Hmm?
Well, that is a very pretty dress you have on
And a very pretty doll
My daughter used to have a doll just like that
[Little Girl:]
I used to have dolls at my mommy's house and my daddy's house
Now I only have one house and all my dolls are all together
And when my daddy wakes up with me at my house
And asks what toy I wanna play with
I say, "All of them"

// Zanies And Fools //

[Intro:]
Well we must be some zanies and fools
To take a gamble on this love just like we do
What a wonderfully crazy thing to do
Love like mine that we were powerless to choose
I'm so powerful every time I look at you
No memory of anything I couldn't do
It's possible, so possible

[Chance the Rapper:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Once upon a time I wasn't sure of myself
I would always claim I never had no help
Look into the mirror, the most unfair of all
Hit the Player's Ball, it was unbearable
Another big birthday, another milestone
To make your birthstone feel like rhinestone
The caterpillars that had burrowed inside my belly
Started to flutter before I learned how to fly
I had a bunch of midlife crisises 'fore I turned 25
The teachers put me in the back where I was learning to hide
'Cause when the teachers call you special, that's a perfect disguise
I had to bury all the dancing that would burgeon inside
I got quiet, thought the silence was the perfect reply
I turn to Casper any time a nigga turn on the slide
Until I turned up at the talent show, a permanent high
I had Jesus behind the wheel before I learned how to drive
'Cause it's press

It's possible
It's possible
It's possible
It's possible
It's possible
It's possible
It's possible
It's possible

Once upon a time, a lady who tried twice
At being a good wife and giving a good life
To both of her lil' girls with ballerina tights
She called up the RE/MAX and opened her own site
Clothes and open houses, hired her own type
Alimony is phony, she paid for her own flights
Crazy office parties, she's throwin' 'em inside
And my mama sealed my fate when she opened the invite
The lady had a plan, she knew it all in advance
The party was a good mixture of employees and friends
She told the people comin' to make sure they bring their kids
Yeah, bring some food, but just make sure you bring your kids
After we arrived and after standing around
The lady take the glass and told us gather around
For a special performance from her daughters, she said it proud
But tonight they not my daughters, tonight they Destiny's Child
Out from the back came three lil' survivors
In formation, choreo tighter
One on the left, I think I might like her
One on the left, I think I might love her
Lady just folds her arms, rubs her hands
All of the lessons, learn how to dance
All of these moments left up to chance
Everything will go right as it can
It's possible

It's possible
It's possible
(Vous allez Ã  comprir, vous allez Ã  comprir, allez)
It's possible (Tu ta grandÃ©)
It's possible (Tu ta grandÃ©)
It's possible
It's possible

Once upon a time, I had carats supplied
To a pair of fair rings I would share with the bride
Every kiss begins with clear cut clarity sides
They were forever, but marriage had an apparent decline
Now we live in fear of doin' what our parents was tryin'
So every Rapunzel don't got the kind of hair you can climb
Every since they lost a slipper, every pair that they find
They say these boots were made for dancing like Mary J. Blige
We live a life apart, life so hard
Life'll never really end up like the start
We learn together how the back door feels
And we was jumping over brooms in tobacco fields
We was the same, all black folks still
Until the white man found out black votes steal elections
So they legitimized us, but behind us
It's still black folks at the back door still
For every small increment liberated, our women waited
And all they privacy been invaded
Almost every trade I got through the slave owner
Dark skin, brown, nose round, but the Bennett made it
Now I wanna give it to her, Sierra Leone, serenade
Sometimes love come with it's own barricade
Sometimes love just gotta hold, marinate
Let it hold, let it wait, here it go, here it go

It's possible (It's possible)
It's possible (It's possible)
(Vous allez Ã  comprir, vous allez Ã  comprir, allez)
It's possible (Tu ta grandÃ©)
It's possible (Tu ta grandÃ©)
It's possible
It's possible

[Nicki Minaj:]
Ayy, yo
Once upon a time, a girl from Trinidad
Had to fly to Canada and sneak into the land
Of the free and of the brave, feet under the sand
And I came in realizing nothing free in the land
Dreams of making money, had to split it with Sam
All that Making the Band, yeah, I could've did it, but damn
Had to really be on the come-up, had to stick to the plan
Went from rockin' with Fendi, now Fendi know I'm a brand
That's how God do, I'm in your top two
And I ain't number two, conquered rap, then the pop too
You gon' stop who? Get off cock, dude
This itty bitty piggy giving bitches what they bop to
I met my husband when I was 17 out in Queens
If you love it, let it go, now I know what that means
While he was up North for a body
I bodied everybody and got known for my body
My nigga home now, he the Clyde to my Bonnie
'Bout to walk down the aisle and be a mommy
Ooh, I remember when I cried like, "Why me?"
Now I wouldn't exchange my life for Armani
Sometimes I feel like I'm dreaming and then it hits me
Gotta remember who I am when it slips me
Kids running up to the car yelling, "Nicki"
All my bad bitches, I know that y'all with me
Fuck they thought was sittin' in my seat?
Got a big bowl of ice cream sitting in my Jeep
Got some felons that'll put you on ice, so don't sleep
'Bout to dead this whole beat for rocks and gold teeth

[Outro:]
It's possible, it's possible
It's possible to me
