// #SoGoneChallenge //

Thanks for filming this
I wrote this for you today
Chano A.K.A. Mr. Windy City
Remix!

I got the baddest chick on the planet
She ain't mixed but folks be askin' if she half Hispanic
She complain about the baby weight but I ain't panicked
Since she got pregnant she been showin' crack like bad mechanics
I rub her feet, I put in work like I was Robyn Fenty
The only chick that I hold as much is probably Kinsley
I sit with her and watch Black Ink and Being Mary
But never Love & Hip Hop, that shit get kinda scary
She stand about six feet, she used to hoop at 'Lane
I tried to stick her the other day and got my ankle sprained
I fell deep, tried to leave, but you know the way that you learn best
Is leavin' out the garage and get hit with that U-turn text
So if you got a girl and she sexy and she grown
Stay your ass at home 'fore you end up all alone
Leave the toilet seat down, always keep your phone
Ask my BM, she got her own ringtone, and she was singing...

// 65th & Ingleside //

Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay
Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

I can spare a rib to get my baby back
I just wanna fall asleep with my baby, yeah
So I don't wake up wonder where my baby at
I wonder if we'd make it back
I wonder can I pay her back, be her baby dad
65th and Ingleside
Way before Jaime got his jingles right
I was sleeping with you every single night
But I was still tryna act single right
65th and Ingleside
I was stacking chips like bingo night
I didn't have to pay for a single light
So I'ma make sure everything go right

Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know anyway not a no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

Your sister owned the house we lived in
On the east side that you rented
Little two flat, inexpensive
I didn't have a glove to pitch in
I didn't have a pot to piss in
Not to mention Ingle city
Not a lot of jobs with pensions
All my raps was bout suspension
Then one day Donald took me on tour
Young broke Chano ain't broke no more
Thought you wouldn't want me come and knock on your doorstep
But I still haven't given you what's yours yet
65th & Ingleside
Moved downtown for a single life
None of my stars ever twinkled bright
'Till God decide to come bring you by

Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

Where's the return on investment?
My friends saying 'Nah! '
That shit was played unless you were here playing the car
We hit the Shell station, I tell you stay in the car
Back in the spot, don't put it in park
Leave that bitch running in case I come running
And skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, grab the gold scar
Better get late 'for it's dark
Kensli couldn't play in the park
Now she can play in the stars
High rise, eye to eye with firework
So high your ears fire, they might've burst
Every time they buy a verse, I buy a purse
But you can't buy back time, it's just not how it works
Three jobs, you afforded the crib
Fuck child support, you supported the kid
A full rack a month, nothing short of my rib
So you first up, go and order a dib
My big homie told me "Nigga growth and development
Go and settle down, don't settle for settlement"
She got you closer to God than you two ever been
She moved over from Evanston, you moved over from Eggleston
First lady you knew you came there
Got shit sunny now you can't share
New Dad step in you can't stare
You know the power in a woman that could lead you in prayer
On 65th & Ingleside
Feel like you can remember every single lie
Truth is I just really need your finger size
So I can make sure they make the ring so tight

Made a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
Made a way out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

// A Bar About A Bar //

That's ten minutes
What you got?
Alright

I got a bar about a bar
It's not a joke, it's just a bar
A nigga walked into a bar
Took a seat, he like "This liquor hard, this woman easy"
Legend has it, he was callous, like fingers that pick guitars
He was just a, hit the park, his pickup truck, 'cause it was dark
To take a piss, the road was long, the line was long and shit
He thought about it, held it in and sipped his straw
Ashed out his cigar and walked out into his car
Forget that nigga, there was a line inside the bar
And the line was so long it wrapped behind the bar
And it, exposed moonshine and wine inside the jar
And it kept goin' to the alley and the trash behind the bar
To the same nigga, he was takin' a piss behind his car
The nigga in the front seen that this shit was out of order
The nigga in the back seen that the meters out of quarters
The patrons and the little wished this line was way shorter
I would tell you their names, but they names is unimportant

Is what I got so far

// All We Got (SBTRKT Remix) //

[Kanye West:]
Music is all we got
Music is all we got, bom-bom-bom
So we might as well give it all we got
Music is all we got
Music is all we got

[Kanye West & The Chicago Children's Choir:]
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
Music
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
Music, music is all we got

[Chance The Rapper:]
This ain't no intro, this the entree
Hit that intro with Kanye and sound like AndrÃ©
Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancÃ©e
She like music, she from Houston like Auntie YoncÃ©
Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll prolly cry at my own service, igh, igh!

It was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
Y'all know wha' mean?
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the Word
This is the sheep that ain't like what it herd
This is officially first
This is the third

[Kanye West:]
Music is all we got
Music is all we got

[Chance The Rapper:]
I get my word from the sermon
I do not talk to the serpent
That's the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm so determined
Told me these goofies can't hurt me
I just might make me some earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothing away
You gotta fight for your way
And that don't take nothing away
'Cause at the end of the day

It was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
Y'all know wha' mean?
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the Word
This is the sheep that ain't like what it herd
This is officially first
This is the third

[Kanye West:]
This is the bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom
Music is all we got
So we might as well give it all we got
This is the bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom
Music is all we got
So we might as well give it all we got

Music is all we got
Music is all we got
Music is all we got

// And They Say //

Huh
Nananananana nananananana
Ay, what they say?
Ay, what they say?
What they say?
And they say
Nanananana a-nanananana (huh)
Nanananananananana
Na nananananananana (IGH, IGH!)
Nanananana a-nanananana (huh)

I know the words (IGH, IGH, IGH!)
I know the words
Haven't you heard?
New album alert
This shit loud as the purp
We out in the burbs (huh)
Out of the streets, we was out on the curb
From out of the dirt, a mountain emerged
A willow was birthed
It's alright, I wept, I prayed on it, slept on it, wait on it (IGH, IGH!)
Just flame up with Tunechi, you know that you Gucci
Just somethin' to say on it (huh, huh)
Smoke like a sailor, curse like a chimney (huh)
My pop's in the mirror, Mufasa is in me
I ain't no goofie (I ain't no goofie)
I ain't no goofie
I am the re-up, I am the plug, you can't introduce me (who is you?)
This ain't a movie, I don't need jewelry, I don't need groupies
I need my money, I need my money, I am the movement

And they say nanananana nanananana
Nanananananananana nanananana nanananana

Man I ain't no lame (huh)
I know the game
I know my daddy (huh), you can tell when I speak I got his name (huh)
I'm on my business (I'm on my business)
I'm not in the business, I'm not a prisoner
I got my soul (I got my soul)
I flaunt, I wear it, I'm still a Christian, I still got hitters (I still got hitters)
Reese and Justin a phone call away
They say no delay, and Ã¡ndale! they on the way
Catch me in the city on the Divvy with the kiddies givin' tours to the tourists
Givin' our city to the kids, like givin' flowers to the florist
Need a little scratch but the tours itch
Proud to go where the pot of gold too rich
Grab a couple bucks, take some more with you (huh, huh)
Ye ain't know open mics open doors did you? (huh)
I ain't no stain, I am for free
I am a promise, capital "P"

And they say nanananana nanananana
Nanananananananana nanananana nanananana

// Atlanta House Freestyle //

[Lil Yachty:]
Earl on the beat, Earl on the beat, Earl on the beat
(Earl on the beat, Earl on the beat, Earl on the beat)
Chance (Yep), Boat (Yep)
Chance (Yep), Boat (Yep)
Chance (Yep), Boat (Yep)

Fed up with niggas, they frontin' like loans
Fuckin' this model lil' bitch from the back (Skrrt)
In the tinted Maybach, almost broke all her bones
She don't do Backwoods, only do bones (Go)
Sometimes a cone if she out on the golf field
It was white like snow, it stood out at the show
I made 250 cash in three days on the low
I was out in L.A. walkin' 'round like the po'
Got a stick in the coat 'cause these niggas be on me
I love what I do, but this shit make you phony
I can't trust a soul 'less that boy really know me
You don't really know me, you hang 'round the homies
Shame in the game, no, I don't work for Sony
This ain't overnight, I move like politicians
Someone snatch my chain, they'll be hopin' and wishin'
My life is non-fiction, I sold out the Brixton
I shot a AK, that shit sound like a Braxton
On the west side where them boys really taxin'
(Go) Yep, (Go) yep
My newest bitch, she a work of art, I could sell her at an auction
Bought a new watch and that shit dipped in frostin'
I take the play, I'm Randy Moss-in
I am no weirdo

[Chance the Rapper (Lil Yachty) {Both}:]
{I am a Martian}
The play was a option
My tape was a caution
I coulda had plaques, I was too busy flossin'
Too busy crossin' the street, I got hits, I got drip like a faucet
This house is too little, it feel like a coffin
I go hit the club like the ball when I'm golfin'
I ball in the swamp with alligators
The house is too big, I got hella waiters
The nanny got stuck in the elevator
Just give me the key to the microwave
The safe is too big to hide the safe
The wave is too big to ride the wave
To ride the wave, to ride the wave (The wave)
I keep on all of my VVs in the shower
I'm blacker than Howard, I'm blacker than Morehouse
I'm blacker than Power
I'm blacker than black people watchin' Black-ish while they TiVo-ing Power
I'm back in Atlanta, I'm back at the house
I'm back at the crib, I'm back in the South
This all makin' sense like the back of the couch
You start actin' up, you get smacked in your mouth

[Lil Yachty:]
Smacked in your mouth by a nigga rockin' six rings
24 karat, all gold, like a young king
These niggas playin' both parts like Regina King
Dick in the spleen, turn the bitch 'to a young fiend
No limit, AmEx, I don't carry no cash
I don't fuck raw 'cause these hoes make me nut fast
Top of the year, tax came, I was too sad
Coulda built a whole middle school out in Trinidad
Funny guy probably goin' to hell 'cause he sin bad
Think like a billionaire, two-seater, tryna fit the whole VIP in there
Shouldn't even be in here, why it had to be in here, fuckin' up the seat in here
I don't take pills, got bills like a white man
Buyin' every whip, I ain't got time to finance
Life like a movie, I was born at the Sundance
Buddy actin' up, somebody come and get mans
I'ma take a bitch for a week to the villa
All-black ski mask gripped like a killa
New whip doin' doughnuts, J Dilla
Went to Panera, and a Panamera
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe (Huh)
Black Rolls Royce like John Doe (Yeah)
Ayy, got him on the tip toes (Go)
Sit a little high like twenty floors

[Chance the Rapper (Lil Yachty):]
Sit a little high like nosebleed (Sit high)
Always ten toes like both feet (Sit high)
You come into to the room, make the hoes leave
I come into the room, make 'em holy
I run through the city like the red line
Young nigga 'bout to make headlines
Sun-Times facin' that deadline
Bout to start makin' up stories like bedtime
Old mayor 'bout to face fed time
Agin' like red wine, me, I'ma age like water
When it's all done, I'ma head to the Father (Mm)
'Til that day, take the Benz to the barber
Got a chop her off the top, got a date with your daughter (Yeah)
Your house not a home like Luther Vandross
You always outside like Superman's drawers
But get in that car, that little ass car
It's a little too far, can't Uber, can't walk
Good guy probably get in Heaven through the side door
Ridin' through the city on my high horse
Big, big TEC on my body like a cyborg
Leave you on a low note, leave you on a high court
I'm a lil' yachty on a big boat
Check the temperature like big tote
Got good aim with the sig
Got a major laser like Diplo

[Chance the Rapper:]
Heeeee
[Lil Yachty:]
Boat, Chance
Boat, Chance
Boat, Chance

Had to ask Bruce "where the truth at?"
Had to ask Rahm "where the truth at?"

Big old Bentley, bitch I mix the Henny with the Simply
Lemonade exterior, Lorenzos under Bentleys
Put you in the friend zone if you start acting too friendly
Bought a baby Benzo and some Kenzo just for Kensli
Wake up real early but I eat late
Go and hit the streets with that briefcase
Time to shake down another cheap skate
You could tell he's lying, cheesecake

[Young Thug:]
Make a nigga bitch tap out
Then put 24âs on a real big body
Bitch said nigga need to stop got 100 racks on me
Can't fit in my pocket
I'm a street nigga, I'ma eat me some soup, I'ma let my bitch eat pasta
Told y'all niggas ain't stopping
Black card in my wallet, I'ma feed my partner
I was at one of my shows feeling like Cam'ron with the pink Margielas
We was tryna beat a murder capital, riding around the town with the pink Beretta
When I got in touch with the money, me and shawty fucked around and filled my schedule
Momma just sent me a picture got Indian in my family through my God damn nana
Young nigga fucked 'round, dropped out school, learned it all through the ID channel
Young nigga fucked around and ran out of bullets in the .40, got to get a banana
These young niggas go brazy, done got that money, they still might pop
So many blue faces on me right now, young nigga still gamble
35 racks for the factories, I steal mammals

Puttin Caramel On garretts
Yellin "Fuck The Heat On Derrick"
I'm a city based N-word
27's, Port's and Spirit's
Been trying to Share that dinner
Can't Inherit from your Parents
#Igh
I was rollin a blunt when I wrote this
I was smoking a blunt when I spoke this
Hocus Pocus
Hows that for a smoke trick
Couldn't pay attention
Now I can afford focus
Got a lil Buzz and they got fuckin bogus
Like How you swat a flying locust?
But it's actually dope...
Acid, adderol and adjectives
An Adolescent I could fuck with?
#Igh's his fuckin Ad-lib?
Burn Burn
City we built
You already forgot the names
Of kids that we killed
Burn Burn
It's Hot as all fuck
Cause everyone got burner
Cause it's always gettin buck

// Child Of God //

Igh
Just do your thing, child
Just do your thing, child
Do your thing

Truth be told, I got the ball on a string
Carried the weight of the world, but it came with some handles
I drag it to the basket, Moses with the passage
Safely Lord God, please make an example
I try to break shackles, now they ankles in shambles
I can't expect them to be grateful and thankful
They thought I had a manual like Hansel
Leave your plans in mans hands and it gets manhandled
Dancin' in the street, but I didn't panhandle
When I finally drop, make a pamphlet
Sell tickets, put that shit on FanDuel, OnlyFans and Fandango
Give me your ear like Van Gogh and it's candlewick
I mean, I mean, it's lit like a candlestick
When I'm fatigued like a camo fit
A rich man: the size of the needle that the camel fits
Walkin' to Jesus with my sandals wet

This world would make you second guess your first mind
Remember when it was your first day, the first time
It couldn't have come at a worst place or worst time
And you remember that low voice with that rehearsed line
Just repeatin'

Do your thing, child (Do your thing, child)
Do your thing (That shit hit, hahahaha)
Just do your thing, child (Oh jeez)
Do your thing (Do your thing)

At every corner store, bodega, delicatessen
Stands a big head kid learning delicate lessons
Roasted for they clothes, or they emotions or they roaches
Bullied by they friends, or they mamas, or they coaches
Half size, chastised, dolls with glass eyes
Talk down, tossed down, the world just pass by
Grow up to be saviors, surgeons, rabbis
The world should've capsized when God got baptized
The boat don't sink, the show don't stop
The weapons form, the load don't drop
The boat gon' rock, the foes gon' plot
The rolls don't switch, the photo crop
The motto is "The more those hate, the more doors prop"
Open, the prince of Heaven was tempted
Told that he wasn't who he was, and they meant it
Never was there a path better cemented
So what they gon' say when you at the Olympics or tryna attempt it?

Remember when it was your first day, the first time
Couldn't have come at a worst place or worst time
And you remember that low voice with that rehearsed line
Repeatin', it was sayin'

Do your thing
Just do your thing, child
Do your thing
Just do your thing, child
Just do your thing, child
Do your thing
Just do your thing, child
Do your thing
Just do your thing, child
Just do your thing

This world would make you second guess your first mind
Remember when it was your first day, the first time
It couldn't have come at a worst place or worst time
And you remember that low voice with that rehearsed line
Just repeatin'

Do your thing, child
Do your thing (That shit hit!)
Just do your thing, child (Oh Jeez!)
Do your thing (Do your thing)

Just do your thing, child
Do your thing
Just do your thing, child
Do your thing
Just do your thing, child
Do your thing
Just do your thing, child
Do your thing

// Dear Theodosia (Reprise) //

[Chance The Rapper:]
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother's name
When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile
You knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, I'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, I'll give the world to you

And you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away

[Francis and the Lights (Chance The Rapper):]
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone, my son
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I'm looking for
There is so much more inside me now

Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun, my son
And when you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I (was so smart)

[Chance The Rapper {Francis and the Lights} (both):]
(My father wasn't around)
My father wasn't around
{I swear that} (I'll be around for you)
{I'll do whatever it takes}
I'll make a million mistakes
{I'll make the} (world safe and sound for you...)

[Chance The Rapper (Francis and the Lights):]
Oooh (Oooh)
We'll bleed and fight for you (Oooh)
We'll make it right for you (Oooh)
(Whatever it takes)

If we lay a strong enough foundation (Ooh, so make)
We'll pass it on to you (The world safe and sound for you)
We'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away (Someday, someday
Someday, someday)

Someday
Someday (The world safe and sound)

Yeah you'll blow us all away (I'll make the world safe and sound)
(For you)

Someday
Oooh (Someday)
Someday	 (Someday)

We'll make the world safe and sound for you
Someday
You will know you're strong enough foundation
One day
Someday

// First World Problems //

[Chance The Rapper:]
I get sad when I look at the stars
They so pretty, you can't tell 'em apart
You think they close but really we far
And really, they ain't even that much closer to God
It's much harder to sin naked
I walked past apple trees and didn't take it
Thought about stone mattresses, thin blankets
Really long winter spent in a windbreaker
I'm a temptation door knocker
Down there on Lower Wacker
I'm a rich excuse for a father
You just can't tour a toddler
She turnin' 2, she don't need diapers, she just need her papa
I really need a break, could really use a nap
My daughter barely recognize me when I lose the hat
You go so far, you hit a point where you can't Uber back
The other day, I told a hummingbird he too relaxed
I did my worst, I did the work, I had to skip the label
I go to church, they want a flick, I want to flip the table
I knew the worth before the birth when it was just a stable
And now it's just a fable, and it's just as fatal

First world problems that niggas make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up

[Chance The Rapper (Daniel Caesar):]
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes (here it comes)
Ready or not (ready or not)
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes (here it comes)
Ready or not, here it comes

[Chance The Rapper:]
Here it comes
Alright
Spirit's working now

I think my little cousins want they cousin back
The automatic quarterback that doesn't rap
They know I used to drive to Hammond for the Roman candles
Lied about coming back, the last straw that broke the camel
It ain't really fun to hang out with me no more
We can't go to River East to hang at the beach no more
It's messed up, I made it this way, and my feet so sore
But it's all downhill from here, I could teach snowboards
I miss my mom, I miss my time, I miss my prime
In high school, I missed my prom, I ditched my date, I missed my beat
Kissed my teeth, kicked my feet, hooped and hollered
Now I just sip my tea, sit my ass on my ass, send my tweet
Fold my arms, twist my weed
If I hadn't heard the news, I would've known what he say
But the recliner on my chair is like an emergency brake, you know

First world problems that niggas make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up

[Chance The Rapper (Daniel Caesar):]
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes (here it comes)
Ready or not (ready or not)
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
(Here it comes)
(Ready or not, here it comes)

[Chance The Rapper:]
Three verses, hell yes
I still ain't get my Grammys in the mail yet
I just want my mama happy like a toy sale
And to stay connected to the world like a long-ass voicemail
I hear the scene snappin', and I'm the team captain
No more knee slappin' or shoe shinin' or shoe signin' 'til the dream happens
I'm just gon' keep rappin'
And y'all just keep clappin' and keep actin'
Like Flint got clean water and y'all don't got teen daughters and black friends and gay cousins, y'all just gon' say nothin'
Know that the day comin'
Knees bowed, tongues confessin'
The last ones gettin' first dibs on blessings

Now these the first world problems that niggas make up
Keep on playin', we gon' shake this shit up
Keep on tellin' us we makin' it up
The American Dream, may you never wake up

[Chance The Rapper (Daniel Caesar):]
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
(Here it comes) ready or not, ready or not
(Ready or not) ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it will not wait another day
No more, no more (it's on its way, way, yeah)
The day is on its way, I cannot wait, here it's to stay
No more, no more (it won't wait, yeah)
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it is

// Found You //

[Ludacris:]
Woo
God's creation
No filters, no imitation
Observations, consistent, you're amazin'
So fine, wishin' that you were mine, but that I'm quite patient
It's so divine, intelligent conversations
Stimulatin' your mind, where's my invitation?
I'd kill for the time to stop the clock
Pull up to your block, in a drop, would love your cooperation
Reserved a place in my heart, and I'm handlin' all accommodations
I'm so floored, you should win an award, for best spirit
I'm hearin' you got all my nominations, all in moderation
Takin' it slow but my mind racin', loosin' all my concentration
I'm spaced out but I'm readin' the signs
And when the stars align, you're my beautiful constellation

[Chance The Rapper:]
Ayy
So soft, so soft to the touch
Type love that cause fools to rush
Type love that comes in the clutch
Hey yeah, hey yeah
I learned it's all by design
So delicate, so fine (So fine)
I was lost but you brought me right back
I just fell in your lap, I had to follow the map
Then I found you

[Ludacris:]
Ha, beautiful creature
Complex, over achiever
Nice to meet you, my antenna's tryna receive you
Your action, you're the special attraction
Lovin' all of your features
Get the picture?
Proverbs, 33:4, I'm caught in the scriptures
I found the fountain of youth, and you're the elixir
It's the truth and I promise to never mislead
One of the millions of fan in your arena
If you was a song then I would stream ya
If you was a novel then I would read ya
Over and over, what's the procedure to please ya?
Ha, you such a diva
Woman of my dream, I'm such a believer
My heart's tryna get in touch, let me reach you
I got food for your soul, let me feed you

[Chance The Rapper:]
Ayy
So soft, so soft to the touch
Type love that cause fools to rush
Type love that comes in the clutch
Hey yeah, hey yeah
I learned it's all by design
So delicate, so fine (So fine)
I was lost but you brought me right back
I just fell in your lap, I had to follow the map
Then I found you

Hey yeah, hey yeah
Found you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
I learned it's all by design
So delicate, so fine (So fine)
I was lost but you brought me right back
I just fell in your lap, I had to follow the map
Then I found you

[Taylor Bennett:]
How you doing? It's Taylor Bennett, the famous rapper
I wanna take you out and maybe even party after
You can crash in, party, catch the morning after
Got booked over paper, that's another chapter
I wanna move to the hills where the breeze right
Know I like it when your pencil start to write
We gotta get it on the dance floor tonight
Baby, I'm a smooth surfer, baby, I'm a you type
Focused on my future, line up reality
Mind of a different galaxy
Mama said eat your vegetables, celery turns to salary
Selling souls while I'm only addicted to forms of casualty
Casualty is a tragedy
Young cause of catastrophe, drop one, moving galleries
Evil is just a half of me
Greatest grace, my anatomy
Adam and Eve's apple in me, probably screaming feel 'em
Thank God for the trade I, for the way I
Roll up in a bimmer, hold up, slick nigga
Moving that weight, fit nigga, guap, guap
Rich nigga, doper than dope
I got bricks in the side of my watch cause my wrist killing
Niggas be tweaking, I'm tweaking them out
So why I'm the nigga you tweeting about?
Trashy ass rappers, I'm cleaning them out
See, be the reason my phone ringing out
Give me a call about nothing at all
Giving me calls about nothing at all
Giving me calls about nothing at all
Giving me calls about nothing at all
