// I Know Who You Been Socking It To //

I know who
Who you been socking it to
If you don't tell on me
I won't tell on you

I know who
Who you been socking it to
If you don't tell on me
Girl I won't tell on you

Don't worry bout me talking
Girl I'm cool 
I'm quiet
And come to think about it
I got a-something on the side

It's nobody's business
Girl what you do
Remember what I'm saying
Is between me and you

Girl I know who
Who you been socking it to
If you don't tell on me

I know who
Who you been socking it to
No doubt about it

Hey

If you don't tell on me
I won't tell on you

I know who
Who you been socking it to
No doubt about it
Girl you better believe that I do

I saw you last night
OverÂ ????
You saw your old man coming
And you ducked back in the alley

When you stayed in the alley
I stayed behind a tree
Oh I saw you baby
But you didn't see me

That's why I know who
Oh who you been socking it to
No doubt about it
Girl you better believe that I do

I know who
Who you been giving it to
No doubt about it
Girl you better believe that I do

// Save Me //

Like a ship
Lost on a stormy sea
I need your lovin', your lovin' arms
To rescue me

The sound of your sweet, sweet voice
Telling me that you're near
So desperately I'm wating
Don't let me drown dear

I got a lonely, lonely feeling
That you'll never come
Oh I guess I can't blame you
For I know the wrong I done

Save me
Give love another try
Save me
Don't, don't let true love die

My selfish pride
Made a fool of me
For years you gave your love
So tenderly

I call your name
Just to ease the pain
I push my pride aside
'Cause I want you back again

I got a lonely, lonely feeling
That you'll never come
Oh I guess I can't blame you
For I know the wrong I done

Save me
Give love another chance baby
Save me
Oh Save me

Why don't you
Why don't you
Why don't you
Save me

I'd feel better
I'd feel better
If you save me

Why don't you
Why don't you
Why don't you
Save me
Save me
Yeah
Save me

// I Must Be Losing My Touch //

Sometimes I think girl
I love you too much now
All I do is sit home
And think about us now

I used to have lots of women
But where did they go now
Somebody tell me
'Cause I don't know

I must be losing my touch
(You're losing your touch)
(You're losing your touch)
(You're losing your touch)

Why do I let you
Mess with my mind baby
Why do I let you
Take up all my time baby

I can't get weak
I gotta be strong
I should be letting you go
But I keep holding on

I must be losing my touch
All right
(You're losing your touch)
Hey hey
(You're losing your touch)
This couldn't be me
(You're losing your touch)
I'm too cool for that
(You're losing your touch)

This couldn't be me
My game is too strong for that
I used to have all girls from blocks around
I used to have all this action in this town

Ah but look at me now
(You're losing your touch)
I must be losing my touch
(You're losing your touch)
Or either I love you too much baby
(You're losing your touch)
Losing my touch

// Feel Like The World //

Feels like the world yeah
Is closing in on me
Feels like the world
Closing in on me

Helplessly I stand (I stand)
Watching love walk away (away)
Nothing I can do (do)
Nothing I can say (say)

Feels feels feels like the world
Closing in on me
Oh it feels like the world 
Closing in on
Closing on me now

I'm in bad shape (bad shape)
Since you been gone girl (gone)

I stare out the window
Cry all night long (long)

Oh it feels like the world
Closing
Closing in on
Closing in on me

Feels
It feels like the world
Is closing
Closing in on me

Feels like the world

// It's Your Thing //

It's your thing, do what you wanna do.
I can't tell you, who to sock it to.
It's your thing, do what you wanna do.
I can't tell you, who to sock it to.

If you want me to love you, maybe I will.
Believe me woman, it ain't no big deal.
You need love now, just as bad as I do.
Make's me no difference now, who you give your thing to.

It's your thing, do what you wanna do.
I can't tell you, who to sock it to.
It's your thing, do what you wanna do.
I can't tell you, who to sock it to.

It's your thing, do what you wanna do.
I can't tell you, who to sock it to.

I'm not trying to run your life,I know you wanna do what's right.
Give your love now, to whoever you choose.
How can you love, with the stuff you use now.

It's your thing, do what you wanna do.
I can't tell you, who to sock it to.
It's your thing, do what you wanna do.
I can't tell you, who to sock it to.

It's your thing, do what you wanna do.
I can't tell you, who to sock it to.
It's your thing, do what you wanna do.
I can't tell you, who to sock it to.

// Give The Women What They Want //

Girls will be girls, boys will be boys
One day they're lovers
And you know the next day
They're fighting one another
They'll work it out between them two
They'll kiss and make up
Oh, you know lovers always do now
They're in a problem they can't solve now
Oh, don't you get yourself involved, baby
They may argue with each other now
Oh, but (Incomprehensible)
You know they'll work it out now
Between them two
They'll kiss and make up
I know 'cos lovers all always do
Girls will be girls, boys will be boys
One day they're lovers
And you know the next day
They're fighting one another
They'll work it out between them two
They'll kiss and make up
Lovers always do
Girls will be girls, boys will be boys
One day they're lovers

// Love Is What You Make It //

Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it

Give love a chance girl
You're still young
You still got time
Handle it with kid gloves girl
You gotta treat love kind

Love is what you make it baby
It's what you make it
Love is what you make it baby
It's what you make it

Always trust each other
Be true to one another
It's a great, great pleasure
When you're doing things together

All though thick and thin
Stay together till the end
Take it for what it's worth
It's the greatest thing on earth

Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it

Trying to get next to you
Girl I said

Don't give it away
Don't give it away

Girl you better save your lovin'
Save it for a rainy day
Girl you better listen to me
Listen to what I say
Girl I tell you now

// He's Got Your Love //

What did he do that I didn't do?
What did he say - I didn't say?
What has he got that I haven't got?
Why don't you tell me baby?
Why don't you tell me baby?

What did he buy that I didn't buy?
What did he try that I didn't try?
What else he got that I haven't got?
He's got you baby
He's got you baby

What did he do - I didn't do?
What did he say - I didn't say?
What has he got - I haven't got?
He's got you baby
He's got you baby

What did he buy - I didn't buy?
What did he try that I didn't try?
What has he got that I haven't got?
He's got you baby
He's got you baby
Honey honey he's got you baby
He's got your love baby
He's got your love
Oh yes he has
