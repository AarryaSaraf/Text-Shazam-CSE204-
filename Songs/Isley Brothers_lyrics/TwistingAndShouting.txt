// What'cha Gonna Do //

All night and day, just chippin' away
It's all in a day's work
Tryin' hard to defend
The time that I spend alone

The crown that you lose, exploiting the blues
Won't get the job done
As hard as it bites
I'm keepin' my sights on you

What'cha gonna do for me?
What'cha gonna do for me?
What'cha gonna do for me?
When the chips are down, in the cool of the night

When nothing seems right
The feeling can take you
Strange as it seems
You make your own dreams come true

If you try to conceal
The way that you feel
You're asking for trouble
Just as sure as I cry, I'm keeping my eye on you

What'cha gonna do for me?
What'cha gonna do for me?
What'cha gonna do for me?
When the chips are down, in the cool of the night

What'cha gonna do for me?
What'cha gonna do for me?
What'cha gonna do for me?
When the chips are down, in the cool of the night

You don't have to tell me
I'm to blame for this
'Cause what you hold against me
Is what I miss

// Stagger Lee //

The night was clear
And the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down

I was standing on the corner
When I heard my bulldog bark
He was barking up at the two men
Who were gambling in the dark
It was Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw a seven
Billy swore that he threw eight, oh

Stagger Lee told Billy
I said don't you go with that
You done won all my money
And my brand new Stetson hat, oh
Stagger Lee went home
And he got his forty-four
He said "Don't nobody move
Just to I'm gonna pay that debt I owe"
Go on, Stagger Lee, get down now

Ah, Stagger Lee went to the barroom
And he stood by the barroom door
He said "Don't nobody move"
And he pulled his forty-four, oh oh
"Stagger Lee" cried Billy
"I said please don't take my life
I got me three little children
And a very sickly wife." Oh oh

Stagger Lee shot Billy
Oh, he shot that poor boy so bad
'Til the bullet went through Billy
And it broke the bartender's glass
Yeah, ah, Stagger Lee, go on now

Go Stagger Lee
Go Stagger Lee (Woo)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo) (Go on Stagger Lee)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo) (Go on Stagger Lee, yeah)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo)

// You'll Never Leave Him //

You'll never leave him, oh, you'll never leave him
You'll never leave him, you need him too much
(No, no, no, no, oh)
You'll never leave him, oh, you'll never leave him
You've grown accustomed to the warmth of his touch (Yeah)

You promised me you'd tell him
How our love got its start
But I know your reputation, girl
You're afraid to break his heart
You're still kissing him, honey
And you know, you know, you know that just ain't right
How can you love me all day long
And cry with him all night, yeah, yeah

You'll never leave him, oh, you'll never leave him
You'll never leave him, he needs you too much
(You'll never leave him, never leave him)
You'll never leave him, oh, you'll never leave him
(You've grown accustomed, yeah)
You've grown accustomed to the warmth of his touch

You said you'd tell him Friday
All you wanted was more time
But now here it is Sunday, baby
And I'm going out of my mind
You tell me you love me
And I think that I believe it's true
But if I waited for you all my life
Tell me what good would it do, oh oh

You'll never leave him, oh, you'll never leave him
(You'll never leave him, never, never)
You'll never leave him, you need him too much

You've grown accustomed to the warmth of his touch
(Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby)

You'll never leave him, oh, you'll never leave him

// She's Gone //

When she loved me, I was untrue to her
I did her wrong, I told her lies
I broke her heart, tore it apart
And I know, I know I hurt her deep down inside
But now, now I'm sorry
So very sorry
Oh Lord up above me, make happy leave me
I said I'm sorry
What else could I tell you? I'm sorry
I know, I know I hurt her deep down side
And I can hear all the people saying

(She's gone) My best friend's telling me
(She's gone) Baby, baby, my baby, my baby
(She's gone)

I'm gonna find her, and knock on her door
Tell her that I'd never hurt her anymore
And if I can have her all for myself
Oh, do you believe that I don't want, just don't want nobody else
And I can hear all the people saying

(She's gone) Yes, she is, oh oh
(She's gone) My friends keep telling me
(She's gone)

// Love Is A Wonderful Thing //

Birds fly, they don't think twice
They simply spread their wings
The sun shines, it don't ask why
Or what the whole thing means
The same applies to you and I
We never question that
So good, it's just understood
Ain't no conjecture
Just a matter of fact

Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again
Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love is a wonderful thing
The only thing a river knows
Is runnin' to the sea
And every spring when a flower grows
It happens naturally
The same magic when you're in my arms
No logic can define
Don't know why, just feels so right
I only know it happens every time

Oh when the cold wind blows
I know you're gonna be there to warm me
That's what keeps me goin'
And our sweet love will keep on growin'

Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing
Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing
It's what makes honey taste sweet
It's what makes your life complete

// Who's That Lady //

Who's that lady? Who's that lady?
Beautiful lady, who's that lady?
Lovely lady, who's that lady?
Real fine lady, who's that lady?

Hear me callin' out to you
'Cause it's all that I can do
Your eyes tell me to pursue
But you say look yeah but don't touch, baby
Nah, nah, nah don't touch

Who's that lady? Who's that lady?
Sexy lady, who's that lady?
Beautiful lady, who's that lady?
Real fine lady, who's that lady?

I would dance upon a string
Any gift she'd wanna bring
I would give her anything
If she would just do what I say
Come 'round my way baby, shine my way

Who's that lady? Who's that lady?
Beautiful lady, who's that lady?
Lovely lady, who's that lady?
Real fine lady, who's that lady?

I would love to take her home
But her heart is made of stone
I would keep on keepin' on
If I don't she'll do me wrong
Do me wrong, yeah
