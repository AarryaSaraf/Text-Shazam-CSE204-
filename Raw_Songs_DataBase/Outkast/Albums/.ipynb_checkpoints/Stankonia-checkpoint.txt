// Gasoline Dreams //

[André 3000:]
Woo
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright

Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?
Well burn motherfucker burn American dreams
Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?
We'll snap for yo' slice of life I'm tellin' ya why
I hear that Mother Nature now's on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go

All of my heroes did dope
Every nigga 'round me playing married, or paying child support
I can't cope
Never made no sense to me, one day I hope it will
And that's that, sport, sport
Pray I live to see the day when Seven's happily married with kids
Woe, woe
The world is moving fast and I'm losing my balance
Now, time to dig, low, low
To a place where ain't nowhere to go but up, you with me?
Say shit, sho, sho
Now let me ask y'all this

Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?
Well burn motherfucker burn American dreams
Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?
We'll snap for yo' slice of life I'm tellin' ya why
I hear that Mother Nature now's on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go

[Big Boi:]
It's shitty like Ricky Stratton got a million bucks
My cousin Ricky Walker got ten years doing Fed time
On a first offense drug bust—fuck the ho-lice!
That's if you're racist or you're crooked
Arrest me for this dope, I didn't weight it up or cook it
You gotta charge the world 'cause over a million people took it
Look at me, I'm out of your jurisdiction, now you're lookin' stupid
Officer, get off me, sir
Don't make me call L.A.—he'll have you walking, sir
A couple of months ago they gave OutKast the key to the city
But I still gotta pay my taxes, and they give us no pity
About these youngsters amongst us
You think they respect the law
They think they're monsters, they love us, reality rappin'
And giving the youth the truth from this booth
And when we on stage, we scream
Don't everybody, everybody

[André 3000:]
Don't everybody like the smell of gasoline?
Well burn motherfucker burn American dreams
Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?
We'll snap for yo' slice of life I'm tellin' ya why
I hear that Mother Nature now's on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go

[Khujo:]
Officer of the most high
You touch me, you touch the apple of his eye
If they kick us out, where will we go?
Not to Africa 'cause not one of them acknowledge us as their kinfolk
Still eatin' pork
Abomination, desecration for beating flesh
Penalty for violation is death
Woe, woe, to the man that strive with his maker on Judgment Day
Hip-hip-hooray!
Mystery, Babylon the great
The mother of harlots is falling, prophecy must be fulfilled
The lake of fire is calling

[André 3000:]

The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go

// I'm Cool (Interlude) //

[Girl:]
It's cold

No, it's cold
It ain't cool, it's cool
I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm cool
It's me, I'm... cool

[Guy:]
Bitch, stay off that blow!

// So Fresh, So Clean //

[Sleepy Brown & André 3000:]
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
I love when you stare at me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean

[Big Boi:]
Sir Lucious gots gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlos
And El Dorados; so I'm waking up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo
So follow, it's Showtime at the Apollo minus the Kiki Shepards
What about a ho in a leopard-print? Ah
Teddy Pendergrass, cooler than Freddie Jackson
Sipping a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left her throat warm in the dorm room at the A.U
We blew hay too, athletes might cake you
But you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make 'cause

[Sleepy Brown & André 3000:]
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
I love when you stare at me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean

[Big Boi:]
Canary yellow seven-nine Seville is on display
My nigga Bongo hooked it up, Omar gon' dip my rims today
So a nigga can ride out to the Honeycomb Hideout
I'mma show you how to wild out like Jack Tripper
Let me be bambino on your snipples
YKK on your zipper, lick you like a lizard when I'm slizzard
Or sober, six million ways to fold ya
Like Noah's, I get two's of youse and you get pretty 'D'
But I'll call yo' ass 'round eight-ish, I know you'll be there for me, girl

[Sleepy Brown & André 3000:]
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean

So fresh and so clean, clean
I love when you stare at me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean

[André 3000:]
Those huge baby eyes, get to runnin' off at they mouth
And tellin' me everything that's on your nasty mind
They say you're malnutritioned, in need of vitamin D
And invitin' me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are, I love who you ain't — you're so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for 'bout two weeks
Rick James'n, no chains and whips
I do suck lips 'til hips jerk in double time
The boy next door's a freak, ha-ha!

[Sleepy Brown & André 3000:]
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm just so fresh, so clean

So fresh and so clean, clean
I love when you stare at me; I'm just so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean

[André 3000:]
And we are... The coolest motherfunkers on the planet
And my, my... The sky is fallin', ain't no need to panic
But ooh ooh... I got a stick and want yo' automatic
Ooh, ooh, ooh... Compatible, created in the attic
And we are... The coolest motherfunkers on the planet
And my my... The sky is fallin', ain't no need to panic
But ooh, ooh... I got a stick and want yo' automatic

// Ms. Jackson //

[André 3000:]
Yeah, this one right here goes out
To all the baby's mamas' mamas
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Big Boi:]
My baby's drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

[André 3000:]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Me and your daughter got a special thang goin' on
You say it's puppy love; we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

[Big Boi:]
"Look at the way he treats me"
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls
Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
'Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song; let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama

[André 3000:]
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

// Snappin' & Trappin' //

[Killer Mike:]
Our shit don't mix like yay and lukewarm water
Better make it hotter splash ice and watch it rock up
I oughta duct tape your infant daughter
Show soldier ass niggas
I'm murder city's Sergeant Slaughter
Guaranteed to get more cut than a barber
I betcha I'll drill your heifer like Black & Decker
The pussy wrecker and White Water couldn't get it wetter
I'm guaranteed to never Swiss cheese for more cheddar
I give a fuck, suede bucks and Coogi sweaters
What up? Whatever sable fur to lamb leather
I've seen it all in the trap with fitted caps for cold weather
And creased denim threats delivered when I send 'em
Niggas know I, FedEx my shit, overnight express my shit
Deliver my hits quick, who next on my shit list
Banana niggas need to split
Quit fucking with this thorough Atlanta clique
This here is Slum Lordz we make your terrific shit tragic
My pen and pixel make violence more graphic
I take raw coke, cook it crack, saran wrap it
One motherfuckin' verse and already it's a classic
One motherfuckin' verse and already it's a classic
Killer Mike, nigga!

[Big Boi:]
Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over K.B. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating 'cause
I'll box you in your motherfuckin' mouth
Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over K.B. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating 'cause
I'll box you in your motherfuckin' mouth

My Cadillac got that boom, boom in it, listen to it drop
Like cereal in your breakfast bowl just jumpin' off the top
A nigga don't stop for squares or octagons prepare
I'm not the one you scared, the Piccolo Pimp done set up shop
Nigga you pop lock, for pop rocks, but I'm only popping tweeters
And woofers and pussies be blowing purple wit' my feet up
I'mma eat up anybody who tests this, I'm blessed wit'
Super human powers, poke your chest in, the next of kin
Gone be the first one like some Mexicans to buck
Nigga you stuck like a truck in red dirt, you's in church
And I'm the deacon speakin' while ya tweakin'
The preacher preachin', reachin', teachin' speakin', being, breathin'
You're not, your clock stop, and now you're laying in a pretty box
And now pastor is only talking 'bout the pretty parts of your life
Your brother fuckin' your damn wife
You look for the pearly white gates, but you realize your fate
It's too late, 'cause you hate, you hate
It's too late, 'cause you hate
Punk pussy ass bitch, game over, who want some?!

Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over k.b. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating 'cause
I'll box you in your motherfuckin' mouth
Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over k.b. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating 'cause
I'll box you in your motherfuckin' mouth

[Killer Mike and Big Boi:]
Roll my blunts thick, like I like my bitch
Lick my blunts and spit, like she do my dick
Attempted murder dick, for ways I choke chicks
Spit it in her eye make it hard to focus
Killer Mike gonna calm down, things gonna get a little crazy
Ol' girl might yell rape G, you might as well give her a throat baby
Goop goobler, goop gravy, no dicking her down to the ground
Now you doing the Dirty South, know what I'm talkin' about
Big Boi, my mentor, hear what you hollering about
But fuck that, I'm looking for love all in her mouth
Need her to gobble up jism, like school lunches
Need her to take cat beatings and throw punches
Like a swarm of locusts, no hocus-pocus
You wanna approach us, buzzards and vultures
We two of the dopest mic controllers
Stack big bank, honey folders
Even wit' rollers, I'm trying to told ya
Even loving, lavish, ladies, leaving, landmarks
Of Lemon-lime, lip gloss on your lavender lapels
Leaping lizards, keep me slizzard, my mind's expanding
Readily rappin' and snappin', snappin' and trappin'
That's just what's happening

[Big Boi:]
Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over k.b. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating 'cause
I'll box you in your motherfuckin' mouth
Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over k.b. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating 'cause
I'll box you in your motherfuckin' mouth

[J-Sweet:]
A whey you want come dis

// Spaghetti Junction //

[André 3000:]
Yeah, Spaghetti Junction, yes, yes
Elope, ski slopes
Damn, yeah, check it out

[André 3000 & Big Boi:]
Niggas elope with ski slopes and fall like avalanches
Tootin' like it's cool: he's a fool, and I can't just
Sit around and watch those nose membranes flame
My ends is loose and you can't stop that rain
When it starts to fall
Lookin' like Ms. Pac-Man, hammers and Vogues and cat-man
I'm speaking about these pros 'cause you know nothing 'bout that, man
The nigga the B-I-G is high and fly like ValuJet
You thinkin' about the beatin', this my ends is never met, nigga
Black man, white man, Jew man, ain't no joke
Remember me and my cousin used to sit up on the porch
And talk about when we get older; now we up against the ropes
Yeah, they're kickin' niggas door down, 'cause it ain't no dope on the streets
And a quarter pound of feet weed, that's all a nigga like me need
Talkin' about that Southern sess, nigga, you all up in that mess
But never shall you test, and never shall you quit
Runnin' up on me with that fuck shit will get you nothin' but dead, nigga

[Sleepy Brown:]
Be careful where you roam 'cause you might not make it home
(In the junction, in the junction)
Don't you dare ever get lost or get caught up in that sauce
(Junction, junction)
To all you players play ya brims and you hustla chrome ya rims
'Llac and pimps and macks I love the corners that you bend
Y'all, yes, yes, uhh
(Junction, junction)

[Big Boi and André 3000:]
Uh, well I'm drankin' on 'gnac while I'm dippin' off in that 'llac ('llac)
The junkies around my way are always smokin' up on that crack
Be layin' them College Park hoes flat on their backs (backs)
Livin' the life of pimps steadily makin' this paper stack
Niggas don't understand the master plan, crumble yo' herb, man
'Til they start kickin' the do' in, then we ready to blast them
Out (Out) like 'Kast ('Kast), we 'bout to crash (crash)
So mayday, may Dré, knock 'em up off their ass boi
We struggle like fat hoes just to get things that those
People got we forgot they're always gonna keep a plot
Right up their sleeve you won't believe they deceive like weave
Thieves can't break in your crib and leave in that good life too
So gimme me and then I'm straight, as eight-oh-five
See, blindfolds can't cover three eyes
We wise to the fact so we attack with what we know
Heaven is the only good life, so what you strivin' fo'?

[Big Boi and André 3000:]
Well, like flip-flops and football socks
A nigga be rockin' the mic like birthdays
Lil' Jon and Sercy, so are you worthy?
I'm callin' yo' ass a flawed pimp
Yappin' about this crew you run with
Bankhead bouncin' to that dumb shit
So what mo' can you come with?
Yeah, they can bite, but cannot be us
They can come and pick up little slang but cannot see us
You ought to be ashamed, trying to fit in my Adidas
So Run like D.M.C. is me and, no, don't got no heater
Well, we zippin' around the corner in that golden stankin' Lincoln
I got my heat up under my seat
Just in case these youngsters tryin' to take it
Pullin' the pistol on another black man was never the plot
But sometimes my brothers lose theyself and try to take my spot
They come like black stallions in the night
Usually around fo' or five is when they figure the time is right
When you good and sleep; I couldn't sleep until I seen it
With my own eyes, 'til they come over the hill—surprise

[Sleepy Brown:]

// I'll Call Before I Come //

[Andre 3000:]
Nigga, quit being so got damn selfish
Put it in ya pelvis
Let it work, gyrate, motivate

I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop up over, out the blue
No, after you

Oh, thank you Lord for throwing some shy
Bones in my body let me tell you why
If not so, I'd be too, too bad
When it comes to pink polka dots and plaids
Glad to meet you, my name is Dre
But you can call me Possum Aloysuis Jenkins
Andre 3000 for short
And naaw I don't want to see your thongs
I kinda dig them old school cute regular draws
And I will pause for your cause

I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop up over, out the blue
No, after you

[Big Boi:]
I'm a gentleman, I'm a satisfy your soul
And then I'm a get mine
Like Wimbledon we back and forth across the court
Until we give out, do you take it all or spit it out
Are you faking the funk and living a lie
Do you really know what it feels like
To have no control over the G spot?
It's like a brand new pair of Reeboks or a junkie freshly detoxed
You feel the tingling all over like convulsions or the rooster pox
I used to not give a damn
But now I make it a point just to please you
So you can go back and tell all your buddies, I Pretty D'd you

[Andre 3000:]
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop up over, out the blue
No, after you

[Gangsta Boo:]
Let's see what you wanna do with the Gangsta Boo
Let's cut, nigga, nigga what, I'll cut you too
Coming through in a Escalade limo, tint with shade
Purple haze in the ashtray ready to get a blaze
What the biz? Nigga jump on in, relax with a lady
With a reputation known for sexing niggas 'til they're crazy
What you mean, dog? Telling a playa like Boo to call before I come
You a game I'm fucking on you for fun
Join the bandwagon, nigga, it's a Gangsta Boo party
Everybody wanna join come and freak with somebody
Riding Jaguars, riding Prowlers, all sports cars
Hitting strip bars with the top down, fuck y'all
Groupie, you need to be glad you even knew me
Do me and tell all my friends you truly blew me, bitch!

[Andre 3000:]
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop up over, out the blue
No, after you

[Eco:]
Nigga, you better dial 404-485, well bump all that
But shit, you'd better call before you get here, and that's a fact
Before you get your feelings hurt
Because you caught me playing nurse
With a stethoscope running around in one of those cute, short white skirts
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't respond to Aloysius
Peeped in the window, saw me cooking shrimp
In high heels and washing dishes for Daddy Fat Sax
And it was something I couldn't explain
I know it's a dirty, dirty game, but you should've called before you came, uh-ye-yeah-uh

[Andre 3000:]
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop over, out the blue
I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just pop up over, out the blue
No, after you

// B.O.B. (Bombs Over Baghdad) //

[André 3000:]
One, two
One, two, three, yeah!

Inslumnational, underground
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground (Whoo!)
Like a million elephants or silverback orangutan
You can't stop the train
Who want some don't come unprepared
I'll be there, but when I leave there
Bet I'll be a household name
Weather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin' wet
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
1-9-9-9 Anno Domini, anything goes
Be what you wanna be as long as you know
Consequences are given for livin'
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell—hot!
Get a life, now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell
Look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm & Hammer
Soul-gold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let your brain breathe
Believe there's always more, ha!

[André 3000 and Morris Brown College Gospel Choir:]
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad!
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang
Bombs over Baghdad!
Yeah, don't even bang unless you plan to hit something
Bombs over Baghdad!

[Big Boi:]
Uno, dos, tres, it's on
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?
Like that there boy and will still stay street
Big things happen every time we meet
Like a track team, crack fiend dying to geek
OutKast bumpin' up and down the street
Slant back Cadillac, 'bout five niggas deep
75 MCs freestyling to the beat
'Cause we get crunk, stay drunk, at the club
Should've bought an ounce, but you copped a dub
Should've held back, but you throwed the punch
Supposed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl, four-year—Jordan
Never turned my back on my kids, for them
Should've hit it, quit it, rag-top
Before you re-up, get a laptop
Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coal
Record number four, but we on a roll
Hold up, slow up, stop, "Control"
Like Janet, Planet, Stankonia's on ya
Moving like Floyd, comin' straight to Florida
Lock all your windows, then block the corridors
Pullin' off my belt 'cause a whipping's in order
Like a three-piece fish before I cut your daughter
Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border
Pitty-pat rappers trying to get to five
I'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive
When you come to ATL, boy, you better not hide
'Cause the Dungeon Family gon' ride, ha!

[André 3000:]
Hello lord, it's me again
I just wanna make love to the whole globe
And all her girlfriends
Now don't that make ya mind move
Like smoke patterns, me on my way to Saturn wit' a bomb
Nam-viet, Viet or Saudi Shawty
I figure before the first gun blast, they know who gon' win
Now won't that make us all fools, like class clowns
Praying Private Ryan comes 'round
Sound travels at one-thousand-one-thirty feet per second
Niggas in the street they want it, hurry
When niggas stop biting that's when 3000 starts to worry
A little knowledge from the college of wizard Ray Murray
Answer quick: do you know what desire is? (Huh?)
Apparently not, that's why you get what you got
Now answer this: do you know what fire is? (Yeah!)
The body of hot, the motivator of pots
Snot, spit, shit are characteristics of release
Ask your niece or nephew, you think we left you
What the future holds in its sweaty palms
Think I'm finna vom'?
You move it like you mean it, she'll come
Prom night might excite a down right fight like
White blood cells to the common cold rebel
Night gets jealous of day, play is no longer
The feelin' gets stronger than ammonia sticks inhale

[Witchdoctor:]
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
And we some home-made bombs
Finna blow right up in your face

[B-Real:]
Look at the way you look at me, I see it on your face
All your hate emanates, but you still hesitate
'Cause you want inside of my head, but don't know how
To brainwash me to be a commercial clown
Fuck that, I see the way you were
See the way you smirk
I'm catching you where you work
God only knows all the trouble that grows
Deep beneath my soul dealing with you assholes
Can I blast those who point the finger at me
Who criticize and talk shit so freely
Fuck XXL—you're a size too small
I should hire Eminem so we can kill you all
Whether you live to talk shit about the Real
Then kiss my ass in person how much you love the Hill
I'm the outcast coming to blaze the grass
Outlaw due to my life that's come to pass
Dré, pass me the glass of wine
So I can pour it over my homies grave and mine
For all those who fallen and answered when God was calling
Jump into my ragtop and get all in
I'm the bomb, planted in your car—why you frozen?
Pop the tape in ignite the explosion
The world is mine, the world is yours, the world is ours
The world is lost, the world is tossed

[Witchdoctor:]
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
And we some home-made bombs
Finna blow right up in your face

[Big Boi:]
With a one-two punch, B-Real and André drop their verses
Your homeboy Daddy Fat Sax playin' clean-up, so it worsens
People and persons on the opposite teams, oh, yes, its curtains
No bullets burpin', oh, just lyrically twerking, oh
Making a statement when you freestyle and your mind is in a free state
It's kinda hard to execute when you ain't feeling it that day
Jumpin' the gun and rushing your flow
Babbling on the mikie like auctioneer
Got the public's ears fucked up, can't hear
Atlanta, Georgia where y'all at? (right here)
OutKast this Dirty South to death the Dungeon Family Camp
Got this thang licked like stamps and nine-volt battery end caps
Making that music that make your neck hurt
And the beats that bother your back in my Cadillac
Six woofers and four amps
Lo pro vogues on swole, with the carriage lamps
Diamond tucked velour pistol in my lap
Come in peace, but then explode like boobie traps

[Witchdoctor:]
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade

And we some home-made bombs
Finna blow right up in your face

[Boy:] Girl you ain't Spanish, that's a Hawaiian silky

// We Luv Deez Hoez //

[Big Boi:]
Ye-yeah
East point in the house like this here

From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails down to the toes
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, we love these hoes
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, we love these hoes
From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails down to the toes
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, we love these hoes
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, we love these hoes

Don't lie you love them
If you don't you like them hoes a whole lot
Just like your mama Sunday cookin', turkey necks in the pot
You ready to drop your load like prop planes, be dumpin' that cocaine
You ready to turn your 'fro, from natural straight to a cold wave
Dat ho name Betty Big Shoez, she wore them Herman Munster heels
Popped a pill, now she's in your Coupe De Ville, passenger seat
I made her eat my meat while I was rubbin' her coochie
Injection in her top and bottom lip straight from her booty
So Do Re, blow me, Fa So La Ti Da Ha I'm tellin' the truth
You suckin' your tooth you treatin' her like a star boy
From a Figueroa to a Herringbone
From droppin' her off to takin' her home
She tried to pull my rubber off with her pussy muscles that was wrong
The bitch is no good like lesbians with no tongues
You fucked around and knocked her up and now you say she the one
Nigga you dumb, you should have pulled it out and squirted on her eyelash
And let her face be holdin' the baby, now she after yo ass!
Yeah, I told y'all niggas
About god damn takin' them hoez to the Cheesecake Factory
Lettin' them hoez order strawberry lemonade and popcorn shrimps
They ain't goin' do nuthin'
But try to take all your motherfuckin' cheese! (Yeah!)

From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails, down to the toes
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails, down to the toes
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez

[BackBone:]
Ay, ay, what's up lil' girl I see you workin' them Valente
She walk wit a fly Sashay
Look here say, I'm Mr. Fat Face I come through swervin' (ay, ay)
You love the way the leather grippin' your butt
Conversation kill 'em, drippin' em up
Relax Shawty, oh lordy, I quote the facts
Whippin' convertible with Daddy Fat Sax
I stay G sharp as a note of music
Call me fresh baked bread, make a broad lose it
I'm just sayin' they just can't stand to see me execute game plan
I slow it down, she like it – speed it up
She poked it out, I beat it up like that
Hit 'em from the back, had to increase that ho vocabulary

[Big Boi:]
From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails, down to the toes
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails, down to the toes
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez

[Big Gipp:]
Yeah, yeah, Gipp keep it double loco
Met up in Cafe Intermezzo for some late night pastry
Conversation hasty 'cause I was ready to dip
Sweatsuit velour so I ordered Kahlua
Fell in, hit her with the garden hose
Left her with the pokahose, got up and didn't say goodbye
Her face wrinkle up and froze
Why you leavin' so soon, supposed to
And ain't no question about that
They call me Big Gipp on the southside
Mr. Get Down in the veins so what's the word
Don't fall in love with good pussy off the top
Better leave for two months come back and pop, "study the shit"

[Big Boi:]
From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails, down to the toes
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails, down to the toes
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez

// Humble Mumble //

[André 3000:]
Ah, I stank I can, I stank I can
The funky engine that could
Ooh, ooh, yosky, wosky, pisky, wisky
All aboard the Stankonia Express
The underground smell road
Everybody's lookin' for an excuse to let loose
What's your locomotive, the Chatta-nigga choo choo?

[André 3000 and Erykah Badu:]
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams
That's the way the cracker crumbles
So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

[Big Boi:]
Back on the microphone, your number one controller
I rock the microphone like a blizzard; I'm so cold I'm tryin' to told ya
Life is like a great big roller coaster
Everything in life don't always happen like it's supposed to
Trials and tribulations make you stronger, live longer
You wanna reach the nation nigga start from ya corner
Everything don't always happen like you plan it
Demand it; over stand it then you handle it
Fuck wishing, you missing the ambition on your mission
Now you switchin'
Why you quittin' 'cause it's heated in the kitchen?
Sloppy slipping in your pimpin' nigga (Nigga)
You either pistol whoop the nigga or you choke the trigger
You've gots to follow through, struggle to complete your dreams
"No Weapon Formed Against You Prospers" 54:17
From Isaiah, lay a, nigga down and spray 'em
If the dealer dealt a fucked up hand of cards you've gotta play 'em

[André 3000 and Erykah Badu:]
Humble as a mumble in the jungles

So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

[Andre 3000:]
Yeah, too Democratic, Republic fuck it
We chicken nugget, we dip in the sauce like mop and bucket
Blue-collar scholars, who'll take your dolla, and wipe my ass with it
You living for the lotto never hit it
I met a critic, I made her shit her draws
She said she thought Hip Hop was only guns and alcohol
I said "Oh hell naw!", but yet it's that too
You can't discrima-hate 'cause you done read a book or two
What if I looked at you in a microscope saw all the dirty organisms
Living in your closet would I stop and would I pause it, whoo
To put that bitch in slower motion, got the potion and the antidote
And a quote for collision, the decision
Is do you want to live or wanna exist?
The game changes every day, so obsolete is the fist and marches
Speeches only reaches those who already know about it
This is how we go about it

[André 3000 and Erykah Badu:]
Humble as a mumble in the jungles
Of shouts and screams

So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams
Humble as a mumble in the jungles

So I guess I've got to re-route my dreams

[Erykah Badu:]
I'm wild, just like a rock, a stone, a tree
And I'm free, just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I flow, just like a brook, a stream, the rain
And I fly, just like a bird up in the sky
And I'll surely die, just like a flower plucked
And dragged away and thrown away
And then one day, it turns to clay
It blows away, it finds a ray, it finds its way
And there it lays, until the rain and sun
Then I breathe, just like the wind the breeze that blows
And I grow, just like a baby breastfeeding
And it's beautiful, that's life and that's life (Ahhhh)
And that's life and that's life

[André 3000 and Erykah Badu:]
Humble as a mumble in the jungles

// ? //

[Andre 3000:]
What can make a nigga wanna take another nigga life?
What can make a nigga wanna do another nigga wife?
Like a butter knife
What can make a nigga wanna get his body so high?
That can't go to sleep, don't wanna eat
Pray to God that he don't do crack
What can make a nigga wanna cut a beauty queen raw
Feeling every drip drop she can generate imitate seesaws?
What can make a nigga wanna fight a whole night club?
Figure that he ought to maybe be a pimp simply 'cause he don't like love
What can make a nigga wanna achy, break all rules?
In a book when it took a lot to get you hooked up to this volume?
What can make a nigga wanna loose all faith in 
Anything that he can't feel through his chest with sensation?

// Red Velvet //

[Big Boi:]
One more time for y'all, y-y-yeah, huh
If you didn't know you know now, OutKast, Stankonia
We shittin' on everybody talkin' that bullshit

Now Peter Piper picked a pepper, that was his downfall
I'm down with 'Dre 3000 'cause he got my back y'all
Ball if you want to, but do it with some class G
Ask me, do OutKast got some flows so you can blast me
Nasty, niggas on the point they see you shining
Engineers in the studio see me rhyming
Don't get me wrong, got four albums; stay consistent
You got a bodyguard, I let my nigga tote the biscuit
Twist ya cap back, you got blood off on ya fur hat
Cap, cap, ya link snapped, you slumped off in ya Cadillac
For what though, some diamonds and a Bentley
What you dying for?
Alright hoe, I'mma bank my cheese and let my mic glow
Prioritize to live to tell these other niggas how you
Bought yo' kid some tennis shoes
Let these brothers know that your mama she got her house too
Let these niggas know that your sister wouldn't have finished
College without you, I doubt you do that though
So do this here and keep that bullshit out of our ear
You too near me to not hear me, to open to conceal me
The love for the music keeping Big Boi spittin' real G

[OutKast:]
'Cause they know where you live
And they've seen what ya drive
And they say they're gonna put one in your helmet
'Cause you brag 'bout that watch
And all them things that you got (Good God!)
Them dirty boys turn your poundcake to red velvet (Good God!)

"Yeah, this nigga wanna floss ? (Yeah)
We got this nigga now
Yo T, I got a nigga right for us
I'ma take him to the hotel
You know how it's gon' go
Nigga keep bragging (ha)
(Yeah)
Yeah, we got him now..."

[André 3000:]
How can you measure a nigga by multiple figures
He may got, got, got
Had he not purchased the newest Mercedes
That lose it's value soon as you drive that bitch off the lot, lot, lot
Would he still be the ladies, most wanted, doggonit you want it
He got it-type nigga 'round the town, town, town
Had he not played it so flashy, ashy when half of these niggas
Hurtin' and workin' would be he be found, found, found
In a ho (ho) tel (tel) room (room) shot up (shot up)
With his dick shoved in something he got a lot of
Bill Gates don't dangle diamonds in the face
Of peasants when he Microsoftening the place
You gettin' on my nerves, well I'm gettin' on your case
Consider your surroundings or you leave without a trace

[OutKast:]
'Cause they know where you live
And they've seen what ya drive
And they say they're gonna put one in your helmet
'Cause you brag 'bout that watch
And all them things that you got
Them dirty boys turn your poundcake to red velvet

[Big Boi and André 3000:]
I know you got the biggest bankroll and you balling
Follow the heater because the leader he is haulin'
Ass like Juan Valdez, I think he scared
'Cause my nigga Khujo Goodie got that tooly to his head

[André 3000:]
Little did he know that, waiting in the closet
No matter what you call that, playboy sure got done

Done was the one who came in contact
With those with slow goals who prompt to sell crack
On his megaphone, "hey look world I'm on" you off
He floss hard 'cause he celebrate the fact

Little did he know that, waiting in the closet
No matter what you call that, playboy sure got done

[OutKast:]
'Cause they know where you live
And they've seen what ya drive
And they say they're gonna put one in your helmet

Chop them hoes and then you skate, back to the block with the deflate
Grams the O's, slabes to whole one's da flake
A young nigga holding big face foldin'
Pimps are known for catching runaways
A good hustler's known to keep his gun away
First nigga run up and try to jack mine

[André 3000:]
OutKast with a K, yeah, them niggas are hard
Harder than a nigga tryna impress God
We'll pull your whole deck, fuck pulling your card
And still take my guitar and take a walk in the park
Any play the sweetest melody the street ever heard
Now bitches sucking on my nouns and I'm eating their verbs
Get full, and niggas, niggas
Pop, pop, lock, lock to the, to the beat, beat
As if pit bulls went out of style, made a vow to myself
If it's for the wealth I'll stop, well put it like this
It's like me selling some dope because my girlfriend wants to shop
Wrong reason, whatever the season, hey winter, spring, summer or fall
I don't stall, slow drag with your brain against the wall
Yeah, nigga, naw, we lean to the side don't fall
All y'all fuckboys, tuck toys inside your pants
Just to pull it out, point it at the ground and make a nigga wanna dance
Now what that be for? You're on that reefer and on that 2Pac
In front of them ooh-wops, trying to show out, that's the ho route
Talking loud talking 'bout that's gangsta shit

// Toilet Tisha //

[André 3000:]
Have you heard the news today?
They say a little 14-year old little girl had a baby on the way
Too much for her little mind to bear
And that type of news to her mama she cannot spare

Toilet Tisha, damn we miss you
Toilet Tisha is the issue
Damn we miss you, Toilet Tisha
Damn we miss you

Tisha? Tisha! Tisha, girl what you doing?
Oh my god, oh, Tisha, Tisha!
Ah, no! Tisha! Tisha!
Ah, no! Not my baby!
Ah, no! I love you, no!
Ah, good Lord, ah!

Don't go away
Don't you dare go away from me, girl—I can help you
Don't go away don't you dare leave
Don't go away, it ain't a thang
Don't go away

[Big Boi:]
Five thousand, one hundred ten days is a short period of time
A mere fourteen years on this precious mother earth
You see Tisha had issues
And her decision making skills were still in its early stages
You know what I'm talking about
Therefore she could not properly handle a blessing in which
She thought to be an obstacle in her path to adulthood
Pause, just like a brother with a thousand pauses
Should I, shouldn't I, I can't, I have to, mama will never see me the same
Daddy and Big Mama I know all of them gonna be ashamed of me
Are just a few thoughts racing through her cranium
As she sits on top of the pale, cold porcelain seat in the rear of the house
The unthinkable moments away from becoming reality, sadly with no clue
And no way of expressing her feeling to her mama or anybody else in her life
Tisha done came to the crossroads and now she got to choose
Fatality, fatality, fatality, fatality

// Slum Beautiful //

[Andre 3000:]
Slum beautiful, driving I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazing

They don't know, but I do though
Baby my darling you make me lose composure
Fragments of a million me
Scattered across the floor to a certain degree
Where I had to give your mama a call
And thank her for spending time with your daddy
For all its worth, girl what's your frequency
And can I come there frequently

Slum beautiful, driving I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazing

[Big Boi:]
Luscious Left Foot
What I like to do most is spit this game like sports announcers
And will pity pat them hoez down like a gentlemen club bouncer
Ounce of killa dilla, be making my game more flagrant
And once I done had some Cuervo 'bout six shots I'm nothing to play with
Like plug sockets and babies, possums, raccoons, and rabies
Maybe Lady Luscious oba kaybee so they say thee
An old school playa pimp type ass nigga like Tony Mercedes
And will work every last muscle off in your body like Billy Blanky
Hanky panky, where did you get your gold grill 'cause it's banging
And I like them red hot Fila straight from Walters off the chain
Fuck them bougie bitches they don't know nothing 'bout you
'Cause you push a big black Buick, so fresh, so clean on them Trues
Slum beautiful you's the world to me, shawty I dig ya
And I'm loving the way them Jordache got a bear hug on your figure
You my nigga, nigga

Slum beautiful, driving I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazing

[Cee-Lo Goodie:]
Look at you, unbelievably, brilliant beautiful you
You're looking deliciously divine darling you really and truly do
The very thought of has got me running at the speed of love
Exploring everything about you from the ground to the God above
Suddenly I started dreaming, traveling in time so fast
I could almost taste outer space
I saw the face of God and looked like you and me too
Hello, I'm the man that God made you for
Profound don't think, okay let's put this poetry in motion
I'm shining simply because mother earth I'm your son
Our entire circumference engulfed in emotion
Forever's gonna be so fun

Slum beautiful, driving I plum crazy
Slum beautiful, soul, but so amazing

[Andre 3000:]
I don't know but, it seem like uh, your daddy must have gave you
A teaspoon of honey every night before you went to bed
Or was it a pack of Now & Laters 'cause you're the sweetest thing on my head
And I'd like to say that I'd love to make love to every molecule of you
And if you want to spontaneously combust that's what we'll do in unison

// Pre-Nump (Interlude) //

[Boy:] Hey baby
[Girl:] Yeah?
[Boy:] You know we've been together for a long time, right?
[Girl:] Yeah
[Boy:] Well, I got one question to ask you
[Girl:] Yes?
[Boy:] Will you marry me?
[Girl:] Yes!
[Boy:] Good, but I got one mo' question
[Girl:] Yeah?
[Boy:] Will you sign a pre-numptual agreement?
[Girl:] What?

(Break!)

// Stankonia (Stanklove) //

What does love look like?
Love looks like you
What does love love feel like?
Love feels like this
What does love smell like?
Love smells like us

[André 3000:]
You make me understand
What it means to be in l-o-v-e once again
Why, must we fly so low?
Are we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow

Stank love
Stank love
Stank love
Stank love

[Sleepy Brown:]
Let me show your mind a new freaky side of love
Open up you flower please let me taste your love
Honeysuckle sweet, can't stop 'til I get every drip drop on my tongue
Hitting every spot of you, what you gonna do
Your body is the rhythm of the boom in the room
Up and down it seems to go
Oh my god I think I'm 'bout to explode

Stank love
Stank love
Stank love
Stank love

[Big Rube:]
My fingertips scan flesh so supple
No longer a couple like two in one skin
Where do you end and where do I begin
Both brains become one mind sensually
Every nerve becoming its own individual entity
With its own lusts, its own needs to serve
Longing for the love of all the other nerves
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction
In the burning chill of pleasure we both bathe
Engulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave
Of an impact so deep, but not one of destruction
But of creation, elation in the re-making
No faking in the relation, no taking in the relation
Just giving of the persona, making love after making love
'Til ain't nothing but Stankonia

Stank love
Stank love
Stank love
Stank love

...Hahaha, yeah, let's screw (Stank love)
Let's screw
Screw
Let's screw, let's screw (Stank love)
Let's screw, let's screw
For all the Texas boys, and girls
Stank love
Stank love
Oooooh
Stank love
