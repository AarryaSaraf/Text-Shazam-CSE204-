If it's a million to one

If it's a million to one
I wanna taste love and pain
If it's a shot in the dark
I wanna feel pride and shame
And I just can't afford to be wrong
I don't wanna take my time
Even when I'm afraid
Don't wanna waste one line
Could have been me
You're gonna know my name
Don't wanna live as an untold story
You're gonna know my
You're gonna know my name
Rather go out in a blaze of glory
You're gonna know my (know my)
