When the lights go down
And the stars come out
I'll be right here, I'll be right here
When the lights go down
And the stars come out
I'll be right here, I'll be right here

I'll be here for you when it's dark out
Underwater and you can't breathe
I'll be here for you when it's past three
In the morning and you can't sleep
I'll be here for you when your heart breaks
When you lose faith, yeah, I promise
I'll be right here
I'll be right here
I'll be right here, here, here, here, here...

I'll be right here, I'll be right here

When the lights go down
And the stars come out
I'll be right here, I'll be right here
When the lights go down
And the stars come out
I'll be right here, I'll be right here

I'll be here for you when it's dark out
Underwater and you can't breathe
I'll be here for you when it's past three
In the morning and you can't sleep
I'll be here for you when your heart breaks
When you lose faith, yeah, I promise
I'll be right here
I'll be right here
I'll be right here, here, here, here, here...

I'll be right here, I'll be right here

When the lights go down
And the stars come out
I'll be right here, I'll be right here
When the lights go down
And the stars come out
I'll be right here, I'll be right here

I'll be right here, I'll be right here

When the lights go down
And the stars come out
I'll be right here, I'll be right here
When the lights go down
And the stars come out
I'll be right here, I'll be right here
When the lights go down
And the stars come out
I'll be right here, I'll be right here

I'll be right here
I'll be right here, here, here, here, here...
