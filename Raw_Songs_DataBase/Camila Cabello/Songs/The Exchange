Came across a picture of you and her online
She looks at you like she knows that you're bored out of your mind
I'm wrapped up in his arms
Feeling perfectly alone
But I know there's been a mix-up
Because I wish his hands were yours

So come closer, closer
Darling, I thought of a plan
Let me whisper, whisper
So that you can understand
We'll be dressed in, dressed in
All black from head to toe
Only we'll know, only we'll know

I think we should trade
Cupid told me he was drunk that day
And so he shot two arrows the wrong way
I heard him say
I think we should trade
We'll tell him let's go on a double date
And meet us up at six in the cafe
We'll run away
And call it the exchange

Blink twice if it's true
But do you think about it too (you, you do)
You said you're running out with her
It tells me that you do (I know that you do)
There's beats that I've been skippin'
When my head is on your chest (you, you do)
And you know if it were us two
It'd be cardiac arrest

So come closer, closer
Darling, I thought of a plan
Let me whisper, whisper
So that you can understand
We'll be dressed in, dressed in
All black from head to toe
Only we'll know, only we'll know, woah

I think we should trade
Cupid told me he was drunk that day
And so he shot two arrows the wrong way
I heard him say

Now that you know it's true, know it's true
There's nothing like me and you
And you've been trying to say it ain't true, but it's starving me how I look at you
I know that you know it's true, know it's true
There's nothing like me and you
And you've been trying to say it ain't true, but it's starving me how I love you
I know that you know it's true, know it's true
There's nothing like me and you
And you've been trying to say it ain't true, but it's starving me how I look at you
I know that you know
There's nothing like me and you

I think we should trade
We'll tell him we'll go on a double date
And meet us up at six in the cafe
We'll run away
What do you say we run away?
We'll call it the exchange
