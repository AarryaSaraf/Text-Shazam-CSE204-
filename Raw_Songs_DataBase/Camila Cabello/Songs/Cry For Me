Yeah, and you look so happy walking down the street, don't you babe
Did you forget, you said that in this lifetime you could never get over me
Are you over me? (Uh)

When I said, "I hope you're happy" didn't mean it
Never thought you'd be so good at moving on
When I'm lying wide awake you're probably sleeping
And maybe what I'm thinking is wrong

I want you to cry for me, cry for me
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me
And if you can't then maybe lie for me, lie for me
'Cause you haunt me when I'm dreaming
And it's time you know the feeling
So cry for me

See that pretty life in pictures
See, your lips erasing me
You're so good to her it's vicious
Yeah, she should be thanking me
Ooh, who's gonna touch you like me?
Yeah, tell me who
Who could make you forget about me?

When I said, "I hope you're happy" didn't mean it
Never thought you'd be so good at moving on
When I'm lying wide awake you're probably sleeping
And maybe what I'm thinking is wrong

I want you to cry for me, cry for me
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me
And if you can't then maybe lie for me, lie for me
'Cause you haunt me when I'm dreaming
And it's time you know the feeling
So baby, won't you cry for me, cry for me
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me
And if you can't then maybe lie for me, lie for me
'Cause you haunt me when I'm dreaming
And it's time you know the feeling
So cry for me

(Why won't you cry, oh?)
(Tears in my eyes, yeah)
(And you're okay, you're okay)
(How can you be okay?)
(No, why won't you cry?)

I want you to cry for me, cry for me
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me
And if you can't then maybe lie for me, lie for me
'Cause you haunt me when I'm dreaming
And it's time you know the feeling
So baby, won't you cry for me, cry for me
Say you'd d-d-die for me, die for me
And if you can't then maybe lie for me, lie for me
'Cause you haunt me when I'm dreaming
And it's time you know the feeling
So cry for me

Cry for me
