You came in like an angel
And everything was looking right, oh yeah
I got my heart on the table
Got me high like it was Heaven-sent

It was midnight, he was a goner
Got no answer, I tried to call ya
Saw the headlights, I knew I lost ya
Stole my kisses, it's gonna cost ya

Thief looks like an angel
I saw it coming but he blinded me
Now I see a different angle
He came and took it like a robbery
Oh no, no-no, no-no
Running in circles, running in circles
Thief looks like an angel
I tried to catch him but he got away

Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away

He walked out like a monster
Left a cold pillow in my bed
Red handed, I caught ya
But you got enough in his hand

It was midnight, he was a goner
Got no answer, I tried to call ya
Saw the headlights, I knew I lost ya
Stole my kisses, it's gonna cost ya

Thief looks like an angel
I saw it coming but he blinded me
Now I see a different angle
He came and took it like a robbery
Oh no, no-no, no-no
Running in circles, running in circles
Thief looks like an angel
I tried to catch him but he got away

Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away

Thief looks like an angel
I saw it coming but he blinded me
Now I see a different angle
He came and took it like a robbery
Oh no, no-no, no-no
Running in circles, running in circles
Thief looks like an angel
I tried to catch him but he got away

Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
