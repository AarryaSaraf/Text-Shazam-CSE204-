I woke up just to miss ya
I woke up just to check if my phone would start to whisper
You said you needed time so I made the clock move quicker
Honestly, you were my only friend
I hate to say I need ya
Look for you in everyone and all it does it feed the
Urge to call you up so I made myself delete ya
Jenny said it's the right thing to do

Tell me is it
Loud where you are dear?
There's a silence here
Where are you anymore? (oh-oh)

'Cause there's a u shaped space where your hands used to be
Baby, there's a pillowcase where you lay next to me
It's 3 AM, you know, I know, can't cure the vacancy
Oh baby, baby there's a u shaped space where your hands used to be
