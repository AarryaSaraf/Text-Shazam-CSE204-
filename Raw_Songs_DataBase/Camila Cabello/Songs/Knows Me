I get paranoid sometimes in conversation
I get paranoid sometimes, I
I got people I call friends with motivations
Hard to tell who's on my side
I was too young, I've seen too much
Wise people change, I got what they want
I, I get paranoid sometimes in conversation
But you and I see eye-to-eye

Can we lay here for a while?
I forgot what it feels like
Talk until we fall asleep
'Cause honestly

I need somebody who knows me
I need somebody who knows me
All these keep making me lonely
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody who knows me
I need somebody who knows me
Darling come over and hold me
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody who knows me

'Cause if you promise me that you'll keep all my secrets
I will take you at your word, yeah
'Cause I will hold you when you crumble into pieces
But right now I need you first
Yeah, I do

Can we lay here for a while?
I forgot what it feels like
Talk until we fall asleep
'Cause honestly

I need somebody who knows me
I need somebody who knows me
All these keep making me lonely
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody who knows me
I need somebody who knows me
Darling come over and hold me
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody who knows me

'Cause I need somebody who (Holds me)
And I could use someone who (Holds me)
And you make me feel like you (Knows me)

Can we lay here for a while?
I forgot what it feels like
Talk until we fall asleep
'Cause honestly

I need somebody who knows me
I need somebody who knows me
All these keep making me lonely
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody who knows me
I need somebody who knows me
Darling come over and hold me
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody who knows me

Knows me
Look at me, look at me, ooh (Knows me)
'Cause I need somebody who (Holds me)
And I could use someone who (Holds me)
And you make me feel like you (Knows me)
I need somebody who knows me
