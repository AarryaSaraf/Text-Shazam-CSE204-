Last night I died
You gave me one look, I cried
I don't know what you did, but
Now I'm shook up, now I'm love-drunk
Need a doctor, couldn't make it out last night
'Cause I died

Oh my God, I hope I didn't blow my shot
But I was so unprepared, I just stared at you
You turned around and said my name
I didn't think you'd know my name
The blood is rushing to my face
There's no grace with you

Mmm, you got me mumbling like, na-la-la-la-la
You got me stuttering like, I-I-I-I
I'm fine, how 'bout you? Wait, I already asked that, oops

Last night I died
You gave me one look, I cried
I don't know what you did, but
Now I'm shook up, now I'm love-drunk
Need a doctor, couldn't make it out last night
'Cause I died
Last night I died

I-In my brain, I'm playing out the things we'd say
So tell me what I wanna hear, let's get out of here
Oh-oh, take my hand
You told me that you'll never dance
But you're looking for any excuse to get real close to me

Mmm, you got me mumbling like, na-la-la-la-la
You got me stuttering like, I-I-I-I
I'm fine, how 'bout you? Wait, I already asked that, oops

Last night I died
You gave me one look, I cried
I don't know what you did, but
Now I'm shook up, now I'm love-drunk
Need a doctor, couldn't make it out last night
'Cause I died
Last night I died

La-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la, yeah
No-oh, I don't know what you did, but
Now I'm shook up, now I'm love-drunk
Need a doctor, couldn't make it out last night, yeah
Last night I died
