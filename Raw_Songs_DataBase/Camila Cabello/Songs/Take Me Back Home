Starry skies, please hold me
River run or slowly
Let me listen closely
Tell me how to love you better

Forest keep in present
Mountains shore, the heavens
Mother teach may lessens
Tell me how to love you better
Tell me how to love you better

Wait, take me back home now
Wait, take me back home now
Change when but I don't know how
But I can't just watch it all
Watch it all, watch it all fall down
I can't just watch it all
Watch it all, watch it all fall down
Wait, take me back home now
Wait, just take me back home now
I need to change, oh, but I don't know how
But I can't just watch it all
Watch it all, watch it all fall down
But I can't just watch it all
Watch it all, watch it all fall down, oh-oh

But I can't just watch it all
Watch it all, watch it all fall down
But I can't just watch it all
Watch it all, watch it all fall down
