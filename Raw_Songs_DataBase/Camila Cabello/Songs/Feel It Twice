Oh I'm scared if I look in your eyes, I might see your soul
I know love is the loneliest place when you fall alone
Sittin' by the phone, holdin' on to hope
Spendin' all night wonderin' why you let me go
I wish you had felt how you're feelin' two years ago
Oh ah

Hurts me to hurt you baby
Lying awake, and everything has changed
Keeping our distance lately
Kills me to kill you when I tell you
That I felt it once, I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take baby
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same

I can feel you still staring at me when I look away
Can't imagine the pain that you feel when I kiss his face
That's when you said
How can I be your friend
When I know the way you taste
It's almost 2am
And I can't ask you to stay
I don't know what's worse
Gettin' broken or makin' it break
Oh ah

Hurts me to hurt you baby
Lying awake, and everything has changed
Keeping our distance lately
Kills me to kill you when I tell you
That I felt it once, I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take baby
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same

Hurts me to hurt you babe
Feels like there's nothin' I can say
Hurts me to hurt you babe
Kills me, I have to walk away
'Cause I felt it once, I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take, baby
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same

The same
Oh the same
Oh the same
Oh oh the same
Oh...
