No, I never liked San Francisco
Never thought it was nothing special
Till you kissed me there
No, I never liked windy cities
But I think maybe when you're with me
I like everywhere

It's the strangest feeling
Midnight, I'm not leaving
No, for once, I think I'll stay
I say your name, just listen
Doesn't it sound different
Never whispered it this way

It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
The feeling of your fingertips
The feeling of another kiss
It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
Like every tattoo on your skin
I'm memorizing every inch
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
Definitely

No, I never did like tequila
But there's something about when I see ya
Think I need a drink
And the callouses on your fingers
I admire them from a distance
Now they're on my cheek

Oh, I've known you forever
Now I know you better
Let's just get carried away, oh
And it bears repeating
How hard my heart's beating
When you tell me I should stay

It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
The feeling of your fingertips
The feeling of another kiss
It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
Like every tattoo on your skin
I'm memorizing every inch
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
Definitely

No, I never liked San Francisco
Never thought it was nothing special
Till you kissed me there

It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
The feeling of your fingertips
The feeling of another kiss
It's gonna take me a minute
But I could get used to this
Like every tattoo on your skin
I'm memorizing every inch
I could get used to this

I feel it all (I could get used to this)
Your kisses, oh, I'll risk it all
Seventeen when we started to fall (I could get used to this)
But we lost it all
And I just can't believe it all (I could get used to this)
Definitely
