Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye
If you don't know yet, you won't believe
What I'm about to tell
But our handsome young prince at the ball
Well, he fell for a pretty young lady
I hear quite the stunner
Who then turned out to be
Uh-huh, quite the runner

See, at the end of the night
This woman split so fast
She left no name
No I.D. just a shoe made of glass
And now he's looking
For the girl
With the other glass slipper
No buckles, no laces
Not even a zipper

The shoe
The shoe, does it look like this?

That's a dirty old boot, lady, swing and a miss

It's hard for me to tell, could my foot be right?

Your foot's the size of a canoe, ma'am, way too tight

How unfortunate for me that I birthed
Ten sons...

That is too bad
But I like those vocal runs

'Ey, 'ey, 'ey
People, look, it ain't me who needs convincing
I ain't the one with the ring-a-ding-ding
Go home, get your girls in the shoe that goes bling
And don't show it to me, tell it to your future king
