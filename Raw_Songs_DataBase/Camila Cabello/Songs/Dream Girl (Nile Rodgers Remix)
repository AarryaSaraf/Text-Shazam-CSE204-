The world doesn't need another dream girl
The world doesn't need another dream girl

I don't care, this is life
It's not fair, it's not right
All that hope and that pride
It's a waste, it's a lie
All you want is to breathe
Little girls should run free
But your corset is too tight
And your heels are too high

This treasure you found bury it
The only way out marry it
That shadow of doubt carry it
Carry it down to your grave
The world doesn't need another dream girl
The world doesn't need another dream girl

You're too dumb, you're too young
Full of heart, so naive
You're so blind, you're so green
You'll give up, just like me
The wings are ornamental
They have no intention of letting you fly
Don't be sentimental
Some legends are born in a wrong time

This treasure you found (Bury it)
The only way out (Marry it)
That shadow of doubt (Carry it)
Carry it down to your grave

(Marry it) marry it (Carry it)
Carry it down to your grave (Marry it)
Your grave, your grave (Marry it, carry it)
(Bury it) bury it, (Marry it) marry it, (Carry it) carry it
(The world doesn't need another dream girl)

(Bury it) bury it, (Marry it) marry it, (Carry it) carry it
Carry it down to your grave (Your grave, your grave, your grave)
Down to your damn grave

There's no way out, no, we don't have a choice
Let always win and let reuse our voice
Don't you know you're living
Don't you know you're living
Don't you know you're living, without choice
The world doesn't need another dream girl
The world doesn't need another dream girl
Another dream girl
The world doesn't need another dream girl
