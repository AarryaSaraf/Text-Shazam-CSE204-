Fire and lights
And a whole lot of dynamite (and a whole lot of dynamite)
Eyes so bright
Have you never felt so alive?

Let's ride right now
Time is ticking and we're home right now
Boys are blowing up our phones right now, right now
Come right, right now
Spend life living with the windows down
Sundown, we ain't going home right now
Yeah, hey

Cause we could be unforgettable
You know, like I know, unforgettable
Wow, wow, wow, unforgettable
Oh, unforgettable

You know I got that, mmm, you like
And everybody got their shadows
And we're all tryna own it, in the morning
And we're on tomorrow
Oh, unforgettable
We could be unforgettable
So hold still

Intertwined, as you lead the way through the crowd
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sit, we're fine
But it's heaven, the way it sounds

Oh, let's ride right now
Time is ticking and we're home right now
Boys are blowing up our phones right now, right now
Come right, right now
Spend life living with the windows down
Sundown, we ain't going home right now
Yeah, yeah

Cause we could be unforgettable
You know, like I know, unforgettable
Wow, wow, wow, unforgettable
Oh, unforgettable

You know I got that, mmm, you like
And everybody got their shadows
And we're all tryna own it, in the morning
And we're on tomorrow
Oh, unforgettable
We could be unforgettable
So hold still

Don't move, stay right there
Stay right there
So hold still
Don't move, stay right there
Stay right there

Cause we could be unforgettable
You know, like I know, unforgettable
Wow, wow, wow, unforgettable
Oh, unforgettable (yeah)

You know I got that, mmm, you like
And everybody got their shadows
And we're all tryna own it, in the morning
And we're on tomorrow
Oh, unforgettable
We could be unforgettable
So hold still

So hold still
