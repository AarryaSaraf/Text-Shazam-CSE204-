You tell me that I'm complicated
And that might be an understatement
Anything else?
You tell me that I'm indecisive
Fickle but I try to hide it
Anything else?
You tell me that I overthink
'Til I ruin a good thing
Anything else?
You tell me that you'd rather fight
Than spend a single peaceful night
With somebody else

You really, really know me
The future and the old me
All of the mazes and the madness in my mind
You really, really love me
You know me and you love me
And it's the kind of thing I always hoped I'd find (yeah)

Always thought I was hard to love 'til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Always thought I was hard to love 'til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Touch me 'til I find myself in a feeling
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving no
Always thought I was hard to love 'til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy

I never liked my crooked teeth
You tell me they are your favorite thing
Anything else?
Stretch marks all around my thighs
Kiss 'em 'til I change my mind
About everything else

You really, really know me
The future and the old me
All of the mazes and the madness in my mind
You really, really love me
You know me and you love me
And it's the kind of thing I always hoped I'd find

Always thought I was hard to love 'til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Always thought I was hard to love 'til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
Touch me 'til I find myself in a feeling
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving (never)
Always thought I was hard to love 'til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy

All I know is you heal me when I'm broken, heal me when I'm broken, ah
All I know is you save me and you know it, save me and you know it

Always thought I was hard to love 'til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
I always thought I was hard to love 'til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
('Til you made it, 'til you made it)
Touch me 'til I find myself in a feeling
Tell me with your hands that you're never leaving
Always thought I was hard to love 'til you made it seem so easy, seem so easy
