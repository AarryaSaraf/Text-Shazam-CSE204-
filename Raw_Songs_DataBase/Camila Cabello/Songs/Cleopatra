Ridin' 'round town in the backseat
Looking like the real deal
Looking real, real, real
Spent so long cuttin' my teeth
Thought you were the real deal
But it wasn't real, real, real, uh

Every night it was a different fight
It was a different girl
It was a different lie, ooh-ooh
Every night it was a different fight
It was a different girl
It was a different lie, ooh

I think I kinda wanna cut my hair like I'm
I'm Cleopatra
Wanna dance on cars
And forget it all after
Skip these sad love songs cause I
Need something faster and now baby
Kinda think I'm better

Needed to be all eyes on me
Baby, all eyes on me, ooh
That's what I want
Needed to be all eyes on me
Baby, all eyes on me, ooh
That's what I want, yeah

See, see
You right to be that
You bein', you needin'
See, see
You right to be that
You bein', you needin'

Ridin' 'round town in the backseat
