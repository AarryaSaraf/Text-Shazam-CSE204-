Album: WhackWorld

// Black Nails //

Readin' my open mail
This ship here won't sail
Best believe I'm gon' sell
If I just be myself
Imma head and you're tails
Red paint on my nails
Keep shit to myself
Listen to myself
Writing bars in my cell
Rice next to my kale
Shirt holy like grail
Distant for my health
My name Whack ring bells
Yes I've changed like Wells
I'm doing so well
So, I say, oh well
I don't tell no tales
Should've spent time in Yale
Bitch, shut up, don't yell
Here, boy, take this L

// Bugs Life //

Yeah
Probably would've blew overnight if I was white
Rap with a mic and wore really baggy tights
It's aight
Yeah, queen, yeah

Takin' bubble baths
Love to see my mother laugh
Can't wait 'til Soup home so I can hug his ass
Niggas comin' up short, where's the other half?
Even if my eyes closed, still won't fuckin' crash
I'm in my fuckin' bag
Whack, where you at? She--
Life is easy, I'm somebody hard to come across
Check the pH level and then I'm done with Voss
Sippin' stocky writing what I be, still I become a boss
Send my cousin to the store to buy some fucking Off!

Buggin', like mosquitoes
Buggin', I don't need those
Loving all my peoples
Dollar signs, yeah, I need those
Buggin'
Fuckin'
Lovin'
Dollar signs, yea, I need those
Buggin', like mosquitoes

// Flea Market //

I ain't tryna rush things, but it's been while now
People have names and they all smile now
Throwin' in the towel now
Bitch you better bow down
Throwin' in the towel now
Tell them bitches calm down
Get on your knees, baby
Copy of the keys, baby
Lovin' your steez, baby
Brushin' off fleas, baby
I don't really wanna have to ask you twice
Yeah, I'll be your girl if you ask me nice
I'll light to you in a thousand dice
Easy to see, like a dangling light

I don't wanna rush ya (won't you realize, I'm the one)
Hope that you trust me (won't you realize, I'm the one)
I don't wanna rush ya (won't you realize, I'm the one)

// Cable Guy //

It goes like ABC (All Boys Cry)
MTV (Men Touch Vaginas)
BET (Bitches Eat Tacos)
You wanna be seen with me
ABC (All Boys Cry)
MTV (Men Touch Vaginas)
BET (showtime)

Wish he had a remote just to control me
We was supposed to be friends, he was my homie
He was there when I was lonely, hungry
Now he seems phony
A real fucking show off
Cold shoulder wipe the snow off
Can't believe I cut my bro off
But I had to cut my bro off

It goes like; ABC
MTV
BET
You wanna be seen with me

// 4 Wings //

Salt, pepper, ketchup and hot sauce
Fry hard cause I do not like soft
My niggas shine with the lights off
Here go some swag you can bite off
Salt, pepper, ketchup and hot sauce
Fry hard cause I do not like soft
My niggas shine with the lights off
Here go some swag you can bite off

Yeah, yeah, yum, yum, wait
Open wide, look at God, homicides
I'm not perfect but I improvise
Drop shit and my niggas vibe
Endless nights I cried when Hulitho died
My city needs me I promised I wouldn't fail'em
If you love somebody I promise that you should tell 'em
Ain't buyin' what you're selling, pockets swelling
Sellin' white, showin' off, feeling like I'm Ellen

Salt, pepper, ketchup and hot sauce
Fry hard cause I do not like soft

// Hookers //

I'm tired of trying love
Don't try to buy my love
I'm tired of crying out
You tried to buy my love, my love, my love

Money won't make me stay
I got my own paper
Move cause you're in my way
Why you gotta ruin my day, my day
Money won't make me stay
I got my own paper
Move cause you're in my way
Why you wanna ruin my day, my day

Ching ching ching ching (Why you wanna)
Ding-a-ling ding ding (So tired of your)
Ching ching ching ching (Why you wanna)
Ding-a-ling ding ding (So tired of your)
Ching ching ching ching

// Hungry Hippo //

He likes my diamonds and my pearls

He needed swag and I provided ('vided)

Open up and bite it (bite it)
Open up and bite it (bite it)
Open up and bite it (bite it)
Shut up boy (bite it)

He don't know no better, yeah

Put him on that Alyx
Gucci on his wallet
Rick Owens on me
They think I'm his stylist
(Bite it)

He likes my diamonds and my pearls
I said, thank you I designed it
Not your average girl

// Pet Cemetery //

They took my dog away
They treat him like a stray
I talk to God today
(All dogs go to heaven)
(Heaven) I miss my dog
(Heaven) I kissed my dog
(Heaven) I miss my dog
(Heaven) I kissed my dog
(All dogs go to heaven)

My dog had a name
Keepin' his name alive
If I had to leave
Hell on earth (all dogs go to heaven)
My dog had a name (I'm gon' say his name)
Keepin' his name alive (I'm the one to blame)
If I had to leave (he would do the same)
Hell on earth (walkin' through the flames)

(Heaven)
(Heaven)

// Fuck Off //

Well honey, I've been so sick, so sad
Whenever I'm happy it makes you mad
I hope your ass breaks out in a rash
You remind me of my deadbeat dad

Fuck off! Go 'way!
Yeah, fuck off!
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah

Well honey, I've been so sick, so sad
Whenever I'm happy it makes you mad
I hope your ass breaks out in a rash
You remind me of my deadbeat dad

You broke, you ain't no good for me at all
I wrote this 'cause I feel ten feet tall
I know you don't ever wanna see me ball
Ice cold, in a coat, baby, I won't thaw
Okay, baby I'm gonna be alright
No way, you ain't even my fuckin' type
Olay, did me dirty, ain't leave no wipes
No way, tell the truth, won't believe no lies
Both ways, I was blind, ain't seen no signs
Okay, baby, I'm gonna

// Silly Sam //

Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Mm-mm, mmm

Silly Sam, what a man, not a fan, oh yeah damn
You play so many games
Tic-tac-toe, Mario
Dominoes, and Uno

If you play your cards right, it'll be alright
And if you don't you're in Trouble for Life

Sorry don't live here, it ain't sincere
Patty cake, Patty Cake, fuck Patty, Patty fake
Get a Clue, Guess Who, yes you, that's who
Checkers, Chess too, player one, I'm a player too

Silly Sam, what a man, not a fan, oh yeah damn
You play so many games
Tic-tac-toe, Mario (and Luigi)

// Fruit Salad //

Worry 'bout yourself and don't worry about nobody
Drinking' water, eatin' fruits, takin' care of my body
When you doin' good they want kick it just like Karate
Stealin' swag I know they mad, they tried to rob me

They tried to rob me
They can't deny me
You can't define me
Don't need no ID
They want to rob me
They can't deny me
You can't define me
I don't need nobody

I did, I did, I did, (I eat all my vegetables)
I did, I did, I did, (lower my cholesterol)
I did, I did, I did, (that fast food just make you slow)
I did, I did, I did, (lower my cholesterol)
I did, I did, I did, (I ate all my vegetables)
I did, I did, I did, (I just had to let you know)

They want to rob me (I did, I did, I did) (that fast food makes you slow)
They can't deny me (I did, I did, I did) (I just had to let you know)
You can't define me (I did, I did, I did)
I don't need no ID

// Pretty Ugly //

Don't worry 'bout me, I'm doing good, I'm doing great, alright
It's about to get ugly flow so mean I just can't be polite
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm doing good, I'm doing great, alright
It's about to get ugly flow so mean I just can't be polite

I bet you ain't heard no flow like this
Make you say yo excuse me miss
Go against me I'll beat like Swizz
I like my paper nice and crisp
Crispy clean and crisp and clean
For the dough I go nuts like Krispy Kreme
Music is in my Billie genes
Can't no one ever come between, yeah

Don't worry 'bout me, I'm doing good, I'm doing great, alright
It's a bout to get ugly flow so mean I just can't be polite
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm doing good, I'm doing great, alright
It's a bout to get ugly flow so mean I just can't

// Sore Loser //

Yeah, yeah
Know you hate to be ignored
But, boy, I've been bored
Keep calling my phone
Shit dead like a corpse
Corpse, corpse
Broke his heart now he
Sore, sore
Change the locks on the door
Damn, another one
Imma need boo when the summer done
Need a fine brother like my mother son
Blah, blah, dun dun dun dun dun
Had a few in the past
But them boys ain't last
Where them boys with the cash?
Ex dead if you ask me (cah)
So, please don't ask me
He's trash, he's nasty
Keep goin', walk past me
Who's that? He's flashy
Maybe way too flashy
That's Diddy, I'm Cassie
Free sample, you can have me

// Dr. Seuss //

Not hard to say, but it's hard to do
Easy for me, but it's hard for you
You say you fly, but you never flew
Not hard to say, but it's hard to do

Let me remind the elephant must be hard to settle it, evident
You only cool when you hella bent
Look but don't touch
I should just be celibate
You the type sell out
Me, I'm trying to sell a bit, relevant (not hard to say but)
I should run for president
Anything's possible
I live in the hospital
I'm sick and tired of all these niggas lyin' (not hard to say but)
About all the shit that they be buyin'
You ever laugh just to keep from crying
Think less about living and more about dying

// Waze //

I was lost 'til I found my way
Eh, you can never say "I love you" too many times a day (times a day)
I ain't have no GPS (one, two, three, four say i-it once more)
When I was sick ain't nobody go to CVS (step, two, three, four say it really once more)
[coughing]
They just wanna see me stressed
They don't wanna see me blessed
They cannot take away what I worked for
I know that I am worth mo-o-o-ore
