Hey, it's me
I've been, I been calling you all day
I just really think we need to have one last conversation
Just give me a chance to explain myself
I know I was wrong
I just wanna be able to say that to you face to face
I love you

Sorry if you I made you feel alone (Sorry)
I know you don't like to be alone
Yes, I can admit that I was wrong
Swear I try so hard to right my wrongs
I don't want you out here on ya own
Tell me when you plan on coming home
Hate it when you mad at me for long
Please don't stay too mad at me for long

Sorry if I made you feel weak
Honestly, I had a bad week
Three feet, it wasn't that deep
TLC, I hope he don't creep
Kiss me on the cheek but not neat
You the only one that know I'm freaky
I been on ya head, widow's peak
Got me crying tears by the creek

Sorry if you I made you feel alone (Sorry)
I know you don't like to be alone
Yes, I can admit that I was wrong
Swear I try so hard to right my wrongs
I don't want you out here on ya own (Sorry)
Tell me when you plan on coming home
Hate it when you mad at me for long
Please don't stay too mad at me for long

Sorry, baby, can you take me back?
I know I been actin' like a brat
Call me, please, tell me where you at
When you leave I always want you back
We can make it work, I know it's true
I don't got no faith in me, it's you
People say I'm crazy over you
But they don't know the shiut that we been through

Sorry if you I made you feel alone (Sorry)
I know you don't like to be alone
Yes, I can admit that I was wrong
Swear I try so hard to right my wrongs
I don't want you out here on ya own (Sorry)
Tell me when you plan on coming home
Hate it when you mad at me for long
Please don't stay too mad at me for long

Sorry, if I called you out of your name
My OG had to put me on some game
I don't wanna lose you to the game
You know it be hard to manage fame
Really I'm sick 'cause I'm to blame
Shoulda never went against the grain
I ain't got much to really gain
If I lose you now, it'd be a shame

Sorry if you I made you feel alone (Sorry)
I know you don't like to be alone
Yes, I can admit that I was wrong
Swear I try so hard to right my wrongs
I don't want you out here on ya own (Sorry)
Tell me when you plan on coming home
Hate it when you mad at me for long
Please don't stay too mad at me for long
