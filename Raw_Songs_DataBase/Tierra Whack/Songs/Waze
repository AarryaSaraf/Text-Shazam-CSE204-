I was lost 'til I found my way
Eh, you can never say "I love you" too many times a day (times a day)
I ain't have no GPS (one, two, three, four say i-it once more)
When I was sick ain't nobody go to CVS (step, two, three, four say it really once more)

They just wanna see me stressed
They don't wanna see me blessed
They cannot take away what I worked for
I know that I am worth mo-o-o-ore
