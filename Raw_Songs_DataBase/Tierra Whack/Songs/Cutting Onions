I ain't wanna talk about nothin'
I ain't wanna think about nothin'
Can you hear me cryin'?
I said "Can you hear me cryin' for you?"

Shit ain't been the same since you left
I hope God plan to take me next
You the reason why I been depressed
Every birthday I'ma wreck
Therapy to get it off my chest
I'm so hurt, I'm tryna do my best
I can never seem to handle death
Hours spent where you last slept
Had ya last outfit prepped
Weezy lied, she ain't even check
Honestly, I'm still upset
Nefertiti chain just to rep
PopPop died, you was never good
Woulda left with him if you could
I was selfish, I misunderstood
I was dumb, I shoulda understood

I can't help but think I shoulda called
More than I did but I stalled
Wilma still drinkin' through a straw
Sianni gettin' big, so tall
Rocky still locked down
All your grandkids love you, you a star
Mary you the realest, so raw
Mary you the realest, so

I can't lie I really, really miss you
Wishing I could hug and just kiss you
Walk around cryin', need a tissue
Walk around, I'm cryin', need a
I can't lie I really, really miss you

Baby girl, you know I got issues
