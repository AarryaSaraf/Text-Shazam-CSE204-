Had a dream I died, woke up I'm alive
Help me with the truth, I be with the lies
Look all at my shoes, they need to be tied
You don't qualify, hello and goodbye
Kept the water running, couldn't hear me cry
Saw me read the message but I ain't reply
On the search for love, bet you can supply
 can't you see I gave him breast and thighs
Money I'mma buy  in July
He was growing in so far he went inside
I don't like surprise, this is what my eyes
See you always watching, should have been inspired
I spy with my brown eyes
This ain't what I asked for

Today, tonight, I might lose sight
Wake up upside down down down down
Today, tonight, I might lose sight
Wake up upside down down down down
Yeah, yeah, down by the river you were faking for cash
Might have been the first but you ain't gon' last
Down by the river you were faking for cash
Might have been the first but you ain't gon' last
Down by the river you were faking for cash
Might have been the first but you ain't gon' last
Down by the river you were faking for cash
Might have been the first but you ain't gon' last

Mom had it, hard working
Heartbreaker need a heart surgeon
Talk about myself in third person
Heard she doing bad, kid's cursing
Bitch nigga shit dick ass
Money calling cause it must be urgent
Pick the phone up, what's the verdict
Wrap it up cause I heard she burning
Too determined, no detergent
Do a nigga dirty with new purpose
I been learning how to be a savage
Daddy taught me well, stupid bastard
What goes around usually make a circle
Better watch your back cause they coming to hurt you

Today, tonight, I might lose sight
Wake up upside down down down down
Today, tonight, I might lose sight
Wake up upside down down down down
Yeah, yeah, down by the river you were faking for cash
Might have been the first but you ain't gon' last
Down by the river you were faking for cash
Might have been the first but you ain't gon' last
Down by the river you were faking for cash
Might have been the first but you ain't gon' last
Down by the river you were faking for cash
Might have been the first but you ain't gon' last
