I know I'm busy and I gotta make time for you
I know I'm busy but I promise to make time
This time

Your schedule is different than mine
I love money so I got no free time
You say I need to prioritize but
Understand that my career's on the line
It's like you wanted me to resign, but
I work hard 'cause I'm my mama's design
You know I got a lot on my plate
So tell me, are you willing to wait for me?

I know I'm busy and I gotta make time for you
I know I'm busy but I promise to make time
This time

I know I never pick up your calls, but
I'd rather text, I guess that's one of my flaws
I got problems that I'm willing to solve
Maybe we can take a trip to the mall
You say I build invisible walls but
I promise that I'll be more involved
You know I got a lot on my plate
So tell me, are you willing to wait for me?

I know I'm busy and I gotta make time for you
I know I'm busy but I promise to make time
This time
