And you knew that I'd get tired, uh
And who knew it? You knew it
Who knew it? You knew it

Tell me why you didn't keep your promise, uh
And tell me why you stray from being honest, uh
You thought you could keep me 'cause you buy diamonds, no
They take it for weakness when you show kindness, uh
I got other options, they in my pocket, uh
You witnessed my glow up and tried to stop it, uh
I thought I was trippin', I changed the climate, uh
I thought I had lost it, but I still got it, uh
Switch it up, I need a new man, I wonder who can
Be the one that I can lean on, I know that you can't
Wave goodbye 'cause I'm so happy, I do it with two hands
Wave goodbye 'cause I'm so happy, I do it with two hands
Two hands

Who knew you were a liar? Uh
And you knew that I'd get tired, uh
And who knew it? You knew it
Who knew it? You knew it
Who knew it? You knew it
Who knew you were a liar? Uh
And you knew that I'd get tired, uh
And who knew it? You knew it
Who knew it? You knew it
Who knew it? You knew it
You knew it
