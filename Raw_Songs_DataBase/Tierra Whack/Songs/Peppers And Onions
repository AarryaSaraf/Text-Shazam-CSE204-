You got to be the one the people lookin' up to
I tried to reach the sun but gum is stuck to my shoes
You got to be the one the people lookin' up to
I tried to reach the sun but gum is stuck to my shoes

I'm only human
I'm not perfect, just a person
I'm only human
Sometimes happy, sometimes nervous
I'm only human
I'm not perfect, just a person
I'm only human
Sometimes happy, sometimes nervous

I'm new to this game
I ain't been here long
So forgive me if I get this wrong
I get lost sometimes
Italy... I Rome
Had to figure certain things on my own
Make a phone call home
To the ones I love
Shit crazy out here
Have you high on drugs
To be real man
I thought about pulling the plug
So I can go fly high with the ones above...

I don't wanna be judged
I just wanna be me
Even tho we buy chains
We just wanna be free
I don't wanna be judged
I just wanna be me
We just wanna be free

You got to be the one the people lookin' up to
I tried to reach the sun but gum is stuck to my shoes

I'm only human
I'm not perfect, just a person
I'm only human
Sometimes happy, sometimes nervous
I'm only human
I'm not perfect, just a person
I'm only human
Sometimes happy, sometimes nervous

The pros n the cons
Of being the bomb!
Baby, you can have the tick
Et might not be your time
But, often times I gotta remind
Myself to combine my thoughts
And never deny my health
A whole lot richer and
A whole lot quicker
But I had to slow it down
Cause I ain't no grave digger
White folks yelling
Yo, that's a brave nigga!
Paparazzi taking pictures
Like I'm in a cage nigga!

I don't wanna be judged
I just wanna be me
Even tho we buy chains
We just wanna be free
I don't wanna be judged
I just wanna be me
We just wanna be free
