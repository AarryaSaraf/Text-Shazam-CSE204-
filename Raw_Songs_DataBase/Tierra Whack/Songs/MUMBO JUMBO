All damn night, I been awake awh yeah
(No, yeah)
Run away, baby hate my love
(True)
All the night, I would wait on ya
(It's true)
Anything you say is on ya
(They know)
Why would I run away from love?
(True)
Why would ride all the night with you?
Run away baby can't find em

Hoping I don't run away too

I hold my head up high and I wave real low
I lift my hands, no lie, and run away, I know
And when I wave goodbye, they all wave hello
And when I wave goodbye, they all wave hello
