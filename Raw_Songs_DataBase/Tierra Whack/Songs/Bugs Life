Yeah
Probably would've blew overnight if I was white
Rap with a mic and wore really baggy tights
It's aight
Yeah, queen, yeah

Takin' bubble baths
Love to see my mother laugh
Can't wait 'til Soup home so I can hug his ass
Niggas comin' up short, where's the other half?
Even if my eyes closed, still won't fuckin' crash
I'm in my fuckin' bag
Whack, where you at? She--
Life is easy, I'm somebody hard to come across
Check the pH level and then I'm done with Voss
Sippin' stocky writing what I be, still I become a boss
Send my cousin to the store to buy some fucking Off!

Buggin', like mosquitoes
Buggin', I don't need those
Loving all my peoples
Dollar signs, yeah, I need those
Buggin'
Fuckin'
Lovin'
Dollar signs, yea, I need those
Buggin', like mosquitoes
