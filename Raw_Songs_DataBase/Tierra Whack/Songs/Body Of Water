I've never been to jail
Tell a nigga that I'm in here like gel
I just want the paper, can I read the mail?
Tell them it's a fee without the male
Do tell, do tell
Yeah, you dig it like a ditch
If I paid you some attention you would probably be rich
Sucks to be you, ol' gold digging bitch
Shit, I'm running this shit like Drake with the 6
Let's go let's get it, I'm committed
It's survival of the fittest and I'll only take a minute
Life is short, I compare it to a midget
Shovel in the trunk of the '06 Civic
I'm with it, I'm with it
There's no way out
You're stuck in the mud, snow, rain, drought
Like tits no bra, you should go hang out
Body like a shotgun, just don't bang out

Let's start a fire baby
I'm so inspired maybe
We can get old together
It is our time like Brady

Let's start a fire, baby

Black or white, you are my type
Like a keyboard, baby, you earned your stripes
I'm on your bike, we ride together
Soulmates so we'll die together
Jungle fever, a firm believer
Lacking on rest but I'm still a dreamer
We can show out like Martin, Gina
Offer a ring and I'll say yes eager

Let's start a fire baby
I'm so inspired maybe
We can get old together
It is our time like Brady
