I ain't tryna rush things, but it's been while now
People have names and they all smile now
Throwin' in the towel now
Bitch you better bow down
Throwin' in the towel now
Tell them bitches calm down
Get on your knees, baby
Copy of the keys, baby
Lovin' your steez, baby
Brushin' off fleas, baby
I don't really wanna have to ask you twice
Yeah, I'll be your girl if you ask me nice
I'll light to you in a thousand dice
Easy to see, like a dangling light

I don't wanna rush ya (won't you realize, I'm the one)
Hope that you trust me (won't you realize, I'm the one)
I don't wanna rush ya (won't you realize, I'm the one)
