Went out to dinner, he made me pay the bill
He said he left his wallet then I said ew
I lost my appetite, that boy here is broken, yeah
He said he had a car but then it got stolen
I can't believe this man still live with his mama
When we FaceTime he always wearing pajamas

He sleep until 3PM, that nigga lazy
He must be crazy, he think we havin' babies (No)

Get up and get a job, you barely tried, you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied (Go)
Get up and get a job, you barely tried, you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied (Go)

Get up and get a job, you barely tried, you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied, you lied (Go)

My best friend asked me why I keep giving you chances
Must be your looks 'cause you ain't even romantic
It's funny how I act like I ain't got options
Boy, I ain't kiddin', put you up for adoption
I wear my hair down hoping you see a difference
But you're too busy eating, piling up dishes

He sleep until 3PM, that nigga lazy
He must be crazy, he think we havin' babies

Get your own money, you've been spending all mine, baby
My sofa's sinking in because your behinds lazy
This ain't gon' work if you don't work
(You're lazy)
Ketchup, mustard
Yeah, uh

Get your own money, you've been spending all mine, baby
My sofa's sinking in because your behinds lazy
Yeah
