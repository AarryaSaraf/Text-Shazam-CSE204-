Sick of being stuck in the house
I wanna go out now
I wanna get out now
We should go out now
Because I'm sick of being stuck in the house
I wanna go out now
I wanna get out now
We should go out now

Now is the time I been losing my mind
I wanna see what's going on outside
I need some love and my hair done
I need some love, could you spare some
I don't wanna be trapped inside anymore
What is there to do when you're just so freakin' bored
So won't you let me out this hellhole
Inside of here I hear an echo
Seems like I may never be free
I wish you were with me

I wanna get some fresh air
Whack shop clothes, someone gotta use there
Do you feel me out there?
Can you hear me out there?
I wanna get some fresh air
Whack shop clothes, someone gotta use there
Do you feel me out there?
Can you hear me out there?

Sick of being stuck in the house
I wanna go out now
I wanna get out now
We should go out now
Because I'm sick of being stuck in the house
I wanna go out now
I wanna get out now
We should go out now
