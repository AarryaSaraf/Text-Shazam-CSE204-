Don't worry 'bout me, I'm doing good, I'm doing great, alright
It's about to get ugly flow so mean I just can't be polite
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm doing good, I'm doing great, alright
It's about to get ugly flow so mean I just can't be polite

I bet you ain't heard no flow like this
Make you say yo excuse me miss
Go against me I'll beat like Swizz
I like my paper nice and crisp
Crispy clean and crisp and clean
For the dough I go nuts like Krispy Kreme
Music is in my Billie genes
Can't no one ever come between, yeah

Don't worry 'bout me, I'm doing good, I'm doing great, alright
It's a bout to get ugly flow so mean I just can't be polite
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm doing good, I'm doing great, alright
It's a bout to get ugly flow so mean I just can't
