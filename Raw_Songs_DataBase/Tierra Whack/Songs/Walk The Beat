Alexander Wang
With the Helmut Lang
Ghetto fab
So I'm still eating chicken wangs
Versatile
So I can keep switching lanes
I got plenty chains
I got plenty rangs
Ain't nothing to a queen
You ain't said a thang!
Bet I Jim Carry ...
Bet they bite the slang
Like to call him necklace
Cause he wanna hang
He was going nuts
So I let em hang ...

Raf Simons
Rick Owens
On the run way tip toeing
Gotta run gotta get going!

And my skin glowing
Told the cashier charge it to my credit card
Chanel scent
I know he can smell me from afar
Insane on the outfit ugh ugh
Baby this ain't even out yet...
