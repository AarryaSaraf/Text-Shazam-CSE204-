Album: PureComedy

// Pure Comedy //

The comedy of man starts like this
Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips
And so Nature, she divines this alternative
We emerged half-formed and hope that whoever greets us on the other end
Is kind enough to fill us in
And, babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever since

Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to address
Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron deficient
So somebody's got to go kill something while I look after the kids
I'd do it myself, but what, are you going to get this thing its milk?
He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we can switch
It's hard not to fall in love with something so helpless
Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this

Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy
Just waiting until the part where they start to believe
They're at the center of everything
And some all powerful being endowed this horror show with meaning

Oh, their religions are the best
They worship themselves yet they're totally obsessed
With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks, these unbelievable outfits
And they get terribly upset
When you question their sacred texts
Written by woman-hating epileptics

Their languages just serve to confuse them
Their confusion somehow makes them more sure
They build fortunes poisoning their offspring
And hand out prizes when someone patents the cure
Where did they find these goons they elected to rule them?
What makes these clowns they idolize so remarkable?
These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new gods
So they can go on being godless animals

Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but to believe
Their horizons that just forever recede
And how's this for irony, their idea of being free is a prison of beliefs
That they never ever have to leave

Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman would conceive!
The only thing that seems to make them feel alive is the struggle to survive
But the only thing that they request is something to numb the pain with
Until there's nothing human left
Just random matter suspended in the dark
I hate to say it, but each other's all we got

// Total Entertainment Forever //

Bedding Taylor Swift
Every night inside the Oculus Rift
After mister and the missus finish dinner and the dishes
And now the future's definition is so much higher than it was last year
It's like the images have all become real
And someone's living my life for me out in the mirror

No, can you believe how far we've come
In the New Age?
Freedom to have what you want
In the New Age we'll all be entertained
Rich or poor, the channels are all the same
You're a star now, baby, so dry your tears
You're just like them
Wake on up from the nightmare

Come on
Oh ho oh
Oh
Oh ho oh

No gods to rule us
No drugs to soothe us
No myths to prove stuff
No love to confuse us

Not bad for a race of demented monkeys
From a cave to a city to a permanent party

Come on
Oh ho oh
Oh
Oh ho oh

When the historians find us we'll be in our homes
Plugged into our hubs
Skin and bones
A frozen smile on every face
As the stories replay
This must have been a wonderful place

// Things It Would Have Been Helpful To Know Before The Revolution //

It got too hot and so we overthrew the system
'Cause there's no place for human existence like right here
On this bright blue marble orbited by trash
Man, there's no beating that
It was no big thing to give up the way of life we had

Oh ho oh

My social life is now quite a bit less hectic
The nightlife and the protests are pretty scarce
Now I mostly spend the long days walking through the city
Empty as a tomb
Sometimes I miss the top of the food chain
But what a perfect afternoon

Industry and commerce toppled to their knees
The gears of progress halted
The underclass set free
The super-ego shatters with our ideologies
The obscene injunction to enjoy life
Disappears as in a dream
And as we return to out native state
To our primal scene
The temperature, it started dropping
The ice floes began to freeze

From time to time we all get a bit restless
With no one advertising to us constantly
But the tribe at the former airport
Some nights has meat and dancing
If you don't mind gathering and hunting
We're all still pretty good at eating on the run
Things it would have been helpful to know before the revolution

Though I'll admit some degree of resentment
For the sudden lack of convenience around here
But there are some visionaries among us developing some products
To aid us in our struggle to survive

On this godless rock that refuses to die

// Ballad Of The Dying Man //

Naturally the dying man wonders to himself:
Has commentary been more elusive than anybody else?
And had he successfully beaten back the rising tide
Of idiots, dilettantes, and fools
On his watch while he was alive
Lord, just a little more time

Oh, in no time at all
This'll be the distant past
Ooh

So says the dying man once I'm in the box
Just think of all the overrated hacks running amok
And all of the pretentious, ignorant voices that will go unchecked
The homophobes, hipsters, and 1%
The false feminists he'd managed to detect
Oh, who will critique them once he's left?

Oh, in no time at all
This'll be the distant past

What he'd give for one more day to rate and analyze
The world made in his image as of yet
To realize what a mess to leave behind

Eventually the dying man takes his final breath
But first checks his news feed to see what he's 'bout to miss
And it occurs to him a little late in the game
We leave as clueless as we came
For the rented heavens to the shadows in the cave
We'll all be wrong someday

Oh
Oh
Oh

// Birdie //

Take off, little winged creature
It's nothing but teens in ravines
And antics on concrete down here
And are you really as free as all the great songs would have me believe?
Let me tell you why some day, Birdie, you're gonna envy me

Some dream of a world written in lines of code
Well, I hope they engineer out politics, romance, and edifice
Two outta three ain't bad

Some envision a state governed by laws of business
Merger and acquisition instead of violence or nations
Where do I sign up?

Take off, little winged creature
It's nothing but falling debris, strollers, and babies down here
And you may be up in the sky but our paradigms are just as deep and just as wide
What with all our best attempts at transcendence
Something's bound to take

Soon, we'll live in a global culture devoid of gender or race
There's just one tiny line:
You're either born behind
Or you're free to peek inside

Life as just narrative, metadata in aggregate
Where the enigma of humanity's wrapped up finally
That as they say is that

Oh, that day can't come soon enough
It'll be so glorious
When they finally find out what's bugging us

// Leaving LA //

I was living on the hill
By the water tower and hiking trails
And when the big one hit I'd have a seat
To watch masters abandon their dogs and dogs run free
Oh baby, it's time to leave
Take the van and the hearse down to New Orleans
Leave under the gaze of the billboard queens
Five-foot chicks with parted lips selling sweatshop jeans

These L.A. phonies and their bullshit bands
That sound like dollar signs and Amy Grant
So reads the pulled quote from my last cover piece
Entitled "The Oldest Man in Folk Rock Speaks"
You can hear it all over the airwaves
The manufactured gasp of the final days
Someone should tell them 'bout the time that they don't have
To praise the glorious future and the hopeless past

A few things the songwriter needs
Arrows of Love, a mask of Tragedy
But if you want ecstasy or birth control
Just run the tap until the water's cold
Anything else you can get online
A creation myth or a .45
You're going to need one or the other to survive
Where only the armed or the funny make it out alive

Mara taunts me 'neath the tree
She's like, "Oh great, that's just what we all need
Another white guy in 2017
Who takes himself so goddamn seriously."
She's not far off, the strange thing is
That's pretty much what I thought when I started this
It took me my whole life to learn to the play the G
But the role of Oedipus was a total breeze

Still I dreamt of garnering all rave reviews
Just believably a little north of God's own truth
He's a national treasure now, and here's the proof
In the form of his major label debut
A little less human with each release
Closing the gap between the mask and me
I swear I'll never do this, but is it okay?
Don't want to be that guy but it's my birthday
If everything ends with the photo then I'm on my way

Ohhh-ho-o-oh oh-ho-ho-ho-oh

I watched my old gods all collapse
Were way more violent than my cartoon past
It's like my father said before he croaked
"Son, you're killing me, and that's all folks."
So why is it I'm so distraught
That what I'm selling is getting bought
At some point you just can't control
What people use your fake name for

So I never learned to play the lead guitar
I always more preferred the speaking parts
Besides there's always someone willing to
Fill up the spaces that I couldn't use
Nonetheless, I've been practicing my whole life
Washing dishes, playing drums, and getting by
Until I figured, if I'm here then I just might
Conceal my lack of skill here in the spotlights
Maya, the mother of illusions, a beard, and I

2000 years or so since Ovid taught
Night-blooming, teenage rosebuds, dirty talk
And I'm merely a minor fascination to
Manic virginal lust and college dudes
I'm beginning to begin to see the end
Of how it all goes down between me and them
Some 10-verse chorus-less diatribe
Plays as they all jump ship, "I used to like this guy
This new shit really kinda makes me wanna die"

Ohhh-ho-oh-oh oh-ho-ho-ho-oh
Ohhh-ho-oh-oh oh-ho-ho-ho-oh

My first memory of music's from
The time at JCPenney's with my mom
The watermelon candy I was choking on
Barbara screaming, "Someone help my son!"
I relive it most times the radio's on
That "tell me lies, sweet little white lies" song
That's when I first saw the comedy won't stop for
Even little boys dying in the department store

So we leave town in total silence
New Year's Day, it's 6 o'clock AM
I've never seen Sunset this abandoned
Reminds me predictably of the world's end
It'll be good to get more space
God knows what all these suckers paid
I can stop drinking and you can write your script
But what we both think now is...

// A Bigger Paper Bag //

Dance like a butterfly and drink like a fish
If you're bent on taking demons down with only your fist
And I've never known anyone who could lose himself in a bigger paper bag
The weaker the signal, the sweeter the noise
Hunching over an instrument that you now employ
Like the Starvation Army needs a marching piano in the band
Are you feeling used?
I do

Oh, I was pissing on the flame
Like a child with cash or a king on cocaine
I've got the world by the balls
Am I supposed to behave?

What a fraud
What a con
You're the only
One I love

It's easy to assume that you've built some rapport
With a someone who only likes you for what you like yourself for
Okay, you be my mirror but remember the only a few angles I tend to prefer
I'm only here to serve

Oh, I was pissing on the flame
Like a child with cash or a king on cocaine
I've got the world by the balls
Am I supposed to behave?

Oh, I was dancing 'round the flame
Like a high-wire act with a "who, me?" face
I was living on nothing but water and cake

What a fraud
What a con
You're the only
One I love

One I love
One I love

// When The God Of Love Returns There'll Be Hell To Pay //

When the god of love returns
There'll be hell to pay
Though the world may be out of excuse
I know just what I would say
That the seven trumpets sound
As a locust sky grows dark
But first let's take you on a quick tour of your creation's handiwork

Billy got through the prisons and stores
And the pale horse looks a little sick
Says, "Jesus, you didn't leave a whole lot for me
If this isn't hell already then tell me what the hell is?"

And we say it's just human, human nature
This is place is savage and unjust
We crawled out of the darkness
And endured your impatience
We're more than willing to adjust
And now you've got the gall to judge us

The spider spins his web
The tiger stalks his prey
And we steal fire from the heavens to try to keep the night at bay
Every monster has a code
One that steadies the shaking hand
And he's determined to accrue more capital by whatever means he can

Oh, it's just human, human nature
We've got these appetites to serve
You must not know the first thing about human beings
We're the earth's most soulful predator
Try something less ambitious the next time you get bored

Oh, my Lord
We just want light in the dark
Some warmth in the cold
And to make something out of nothing sounds like someone else I know

// Smoochie //

When my personal demons are screaming
And when my door of madness is half-open

You stand alongside
And say something to the effect that everything'll be
Alright
Soon
Smoochie

Chaos attends to creation
And when the shadows inside me vie for attention

You stand alongside
And say something perfect like "concealment feeds the fear."
And hand me a sea peach
And say, "Come, come over here
Smoochie."

// Two Wildly Different Perspectives //

One side says
"Y'all go to hell."
The other says
"If I believed in God, I'd send you there."
But either way we make some space
In the hell that we create
On both sides

One side says
"Kill 'em all."
The other says
"Line those killers up against the wall."
But either way some blood is shed
Thanks to our cooperation
On both sides
On both sides

One side says
"Man, take what's yours!"
The other says
"Live on no more than you can afford."
But either way we just possess
And everyone ends up with less
On both sides
On both sides

// The Memo //

I'm gonna steal some bedsheets
From an amputee
I'm gonna mount em on a canvas
In the middle of the gallery
I'm gonna tell everybody
It was painted by a chimpanzee
Just between you and me
Here at the cultural low watermark
If it's fraud or art
They'll pay you to believe

I'm gonna take five young dudes
From white families
I'm gonna mount 'em on a billboard
In the middle of the country
I'm gonna tell everybody
They sing like angels with whiter teeth
But just between you and me
They're just like the ones before
With their standards lower
Another concert-goer will pay you to believe

Oh, caffeine in the morning, alcohol at night
Cameras to record you and mirrors to recognize
And as the world is getting smaller, small things take up all your time
Narcissus would have had a field day if he could have got online
And friends it's not self-love that kills you
It's when those who hate you are allowed
To sell you that you're a glorious shit
The entire world revolves around
And that you're the eater, no not the eaten
But that your hunger will only cease
If you come binge on radiant blandness
At the disposable feast

(You're enjoying the chill winter playlist)
Just quickly how would you rate yourself
[?]
In terms of sex appeal and cultural significance?
(Irony, irony
Blo blo blo blo blo blo blo)
Do you usually listen to music like this?
(Just one more mile, you can do it again)
Can we recommend some similar artists?
(This is totally the song of my summer)
Are you feeling depressed?
(This guy just gets me)
But your feedback's important
To us
(Music is my life)

Gonna buy myself a sports team
And put 'em in a pit
I'm gonna wage the old crusade
Against consciousness
All I need's a couple winners
To get every loser to fight in it
Keep the golden calf
Just need the bullshit
And they won't just sell themselves into slavery
They'll get on their knees and pay you to believe

// So I'm Growing Old On Magic Mountain //

That was the last New Year I'll ever see
And I wanna stay on that magic mountain
With lost souls and beautiful women
I drank some of Farmer's potion
And we were moving in slow motion

The slower, the better
The slower, the better
'Cause there's no one old on magic mountain
There's no one old, old on magic mountain

And that was the very last barn I'm burning
So for now everyone is dancing
As if it's any time but the present
So for now every young thing in my path
I'll hold their face so long inside my hands

The longer, the better
The longer, the better
'Cause there's no one old on magic mountain
There's no one old, old on magic mountain

The wine has all been emptied
And smoke has cleared
As people file back to the valley
On the last night of life's party
These days the years thin till I can't remember
Just what it feels like to be young forever

So the longer I stay here
The longer there's no future
So I'm growing old on magic mountain
I'm growing old, old on magic mountain

// In Twenty Years Or So //

What's there to lose
For a ghost in a cheap rental suit
Clinging to a rock that is hurtling through space?

And what's to regret
For a speck on a speck on a speck
Made more ridiculous the more serious he gets?

Oh, it's easy to forget

Oh, I read somewhere
That in twenty years
More or less
This human experiment will reach its violent end
But I look at you
As our second drinks arrive
The piano player's playing "This Must Be the Place"
And it's a miracle to be alive

One more time

There's nothing to fear
There's nothing to fear
There's nothing to fear
