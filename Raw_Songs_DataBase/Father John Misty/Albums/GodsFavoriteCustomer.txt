// Hangout At The Gallows //

Sun is rising
Black is turning blue
Look out, buddy, Noah's calling
Jesus, man, what did you do?

Psychic terrorists
In the upper room
Left foot, right foot
That's the ticket
You'll be back on top real soon

Whose bright idea was it to sharpen the knives?
Just twenty minutes 'fore the boat capsized
If you want an answer, it's anybody's guess
I'm treading water as I bleed to death

What's your politics?
What's your religion?
What's your intake?
Your reason for living?

In your compositions
At the start of every song
Find you waking in the morning
Always there to greet the dawn

Trouble sleeping
My alarm goes off
So you wanna hangout at the gallows?
Those guys get an early start

Oh, whose bright idea was it to sharpen the knives?
Just twenty minutes 'fore the boat capsized
If you want an answer, it's anybody's guess
I'm treading water as I bleed to death

What's your politics?
What's your religion?
What's your intake?
Your reason for living?

Oh, oh what's your politics?
What's your religion?
What's your intake?
Your reason for living?

// Mr. Tillman //

Mr. Tillman, good to see you again
There's a few outstanding charges just before we check you in
Let's see here, you left your passport in the mini fridge
And a message with the desk says here the picture isn't his
And oh, just a reminder about our policy:
Don't leave your mattress in the rain if you sleep on the balcony
Okay, did you and your guests have a pleasant stay?
What a beautiful tattoo that young man had on his face
And oh, will you need a driver out to Philly?
Jason Isbell's here as well
And he seemed a little worried about you

I'm feeling good
Damn, I'm feeling so fine
I'm living on a cloud above an island in my mind
Oh baby, don't be alarmed this is just my vibe
No need to walk around
No, it's not too bad to climb

Mr. Tillman, for the seventh time
We have no knowledge of a film that is being shot outside
Those aren't extras in a movie; they're our clientele
No, they aren't running lines and they aren't exactly thrilled
Would you like a regalo on the patio?
Is there someone we can call?
Perhaps you shouldn't drink alone

I'm feeling good
Damn, I'm feeling so fine
I'm living on a cloud above an island in my mind
Oh baby, don't be alarmed this is just my vibe
No need to walk around
No, it's not too bad to climb

// Just Dumb Enough To Try //

I know a few ten-cent words
I can break out to keep up with her
But you can take what I know about love
And drown it in the sink

I know my way around a tune
Won't be a single dry eye in a room
But you can take what I know about you
And maybe fill a small balloon

But I'm just dumb enough to try
To keep you in my life
For a little while longer
And I'm insane enough to think
I'm gonna get out with my skin
And start my life again

I'm no stranger to the female form
Oh, I've been here a few times before
Oh, but you could have me anytime
Everything's cool, I'm great, it's fine

Oh, but I'm just dumb enough to try
To keep you in my life
For a little while longer
And I'm insane enough to think
I'm gonna get out with my skin
And start my life again

// Date Night //

Nothing surprises me much
And my hobbies include
Laughing in the dark
Do you want to go to the farm?
Do you want to go to the park?
I'll get you ice-cream if you give me your card

Nothing impresses me much
I've got a great attitude
And a map to the stars
I've got your number from that sign in the lawn
I also want to vanquish evil but my mojo is gone

Come on, I bet you know most of my friends
They're some real exclusive dudes from just around the bend
They're playing demos
Oh, they're wearing Dries
I can escort you down the runway, I just joined the police...
Just right now! So you wanna be a grifter like me?
Are you hearing impaired with your own URL?
I'm the second coming
Oh, I'm the last to know
I didn't get invited but I know where to go

// Please Don't Die //

One more wasted morning
When I could be holding you
To my side somebody stop this joyless joy ride
I'm feeling older than my thirty-five years

One more cryptic message
Thinking that I might end it
Oh god, you must have woken up
To me saying that it's all too much
I'll take it easy with the morbid stuff

Honey I'm worried 'bout you
You're too much to lose
You're all that I have
And, honey I'm worried 'bout you
Put yourself in my shoes
You're all that I have so please don't die
Wherever you are tonight

All these pointless benders
With reptilian strangers
Oh my god you're so naive
You leave this world in a drunken heap
Who'll make the arrangements, baby, them or me?

Honey I'm worried 'bout you
You're too much to lose
You're all that I have
And, honey I'm worried 'bout you
Put yourself in my shoes
You're all that I have
You're all that I have
You're all that I have
So please don't die
Wherever you are tonight

// The Palace //

It's only been three weeks
And a bag of speed from Jamie the PhD
She comes by the front desk
To leave my transcript with her edits

Cause I don't wanna leave the palace
At least that's what my true love calls it
Last night I wrote a poem
Man, I must have been in the poem zone
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head

Maybe I'll get a pet
Learn how to take care of somebody else
Maybe I'll name him Jeff
But I think it might defeat the purpose
Living on house keeping and room service

But I don't wanna leave the palace
Let's pay someone to move in and fix this
Last night I texted your iPhone
And said "I think I'm ready to come home"
I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
I'm way in over my head

// Disappointing Diamonds Are The Rarest Of Them All //

Like a pervert on a crowded bus
A glare of love bears down on us
Like a carcass left out in the heat
This love is bursting out of me

Disappointing diamonds are the rarest of them all
And a love that last forever really can't be that special
Sure we know our roles, and how it's supposed to go
Does everybody have to be the greatest story ever told?

Like an oil tanker tipped at sea
This love's contaminated me
Like a constant twitching in my eye
This love of ours will never die

Disappointing diamonds are the rarest of them all
And a love that last forever really can't be that special
Sure we know our roles, how it's supposed to go
Does everybody have to be the greatest story ever told?

// God's Favorite Customer //

Another night on the straights
All bug-eyed and babbling
Out on the corner
Of 7th and 8th

I'm in the business of living
Yeah that's something I'd say
All I need is a new friend
I'm only five blocks away

Speak to me
Won't you speak, sweet angel?
Don't you remember me?
I was God's favorite customer

Beware the man who has everything
Everything that he wants
You can spot him from a mile away
In his gold chain and only one pair of socks

I'm out here testing the maxim
That all good things have to stop
The bar closes at 5
But the big man is just opening shop

Speak to me
Won't you speak, sweet angel?
Don't you remember me?
I was God's favorite customer
But now I'm in trouble

Speak to me
Won't you speak, sweet angel?
I need some company
I swear, just one more night longer

// The Songwriter //

What would it sound like if you were the songwriter
And you made your living off of me
Would you detail your near-constant consternation
Or the way my very presence makes your muses up and flee

Goodbye, little songbird, I can leave
Goodbye, my love, is there anything else you need?

What would it sound like if you were the songwriter
And you did your living around me?
Would you undress me repeatedly in public
To show how very noble and naked you can be?

Goodbye, little songbird, now you're free
Don't forget I'm the only fan of yours who has the sense to ever leave you be
How could you do this to me?

What would it sound like if you were the songwriter
And loving me was your unsung masterpiece?

// We're Only People (And There's Not Much Anyone Can Do About That) //

People, we're only people
There's not much anyone can do, really do about that
But it hasn't stopped us yet
People, we know so little about ourselves
But just enough to wanna be nearly anybody else
How does that add up?

Oh, friends, all my friends
Oh, I hope you're somewhere smiling
Just know I think about you more kindly than you and I have ever been
And I'll see you the next time around the bend

People, what's the deal?
You've been hurt
And I've been hurt
But what do we do now?
People, we're only people
There ain't a thing one person can ever change about that

Oh, friends, all my friends
Oh, I hope you're somewhere smiling
Just know I think about you more kindly than you and I have ever been
And I'll see you the next time around the bend

I think the end of it all may look a lot like the beginning
Passed around from hand to hand
Screaming for no particular reason
The company gets pretty thin
So we start to shed all our distinctions
So why not me?
Why not you?
Why not now?
