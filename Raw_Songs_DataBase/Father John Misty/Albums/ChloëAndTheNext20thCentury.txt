Album: ChloëAndTheNext20thCentury

// Chloë //

Chloë is a borough socialist
She insists there's not much more to it
Than drinks with a certain element
Of downtown art criticism
I benefit more than I should admit
From her unscrupulous therapist
How Benzedrine's supposed to address
Your shoplifting's anybody's guess

Chloë
Chloë
Please don't ever change

That story that continues to persist
How you could have dropped the cigarette
On the trip, your boyfriend's canoe flipped
Doesn't loose your grip on me a bit

She and I, we were inseparable
Till Ma called my East Coast uncle to
Ascertain the welfare of her son
Howard said "Mary, you'd better come"

Chloë
Her name is Chloë
And he's talkin' awful strange

But the more they abhor you
The more I adore you
I would, but I can't
My heart don't stand a chance
Of even a glance
Her soul is a pitch black expanse

Summer ended on the balcony
She put on Flight of the Valkyries
At her thirty first birthday party
Took a leap into the autumn leaves

// Goodbye Mr. Blue //

This may be the last time
The last time I put on my shoes
Go down to the corner
And buy the damn cat the expensive food

That Turkish Angora is 'bout the only thing left of me and you
Early this morning, it started making sounds that say
"Don't the last time come too soon?
One down, eight to go, but it's no less true
Don't the last time come too soon?"

This may be the last time
Last time I get out of bed
Put coffee on and try, in your words
"To show some initiative"

We used to lay around here laughing
At what these freaks out there were trying to prove
But what's wasting time if not throwing it away on work
When the last time comes so soon
Mr. Blue died in my arms, nothing they could do
Don't the last time come too soon

Love's always gonna leave ya
No matter what they say
You only know what it is once it's gone away

This may be the last time
The last time I lay here with you
Do you swear it's not the cat?
You don't have to answer that
I'll just make do
But maybe if he'd gone sooner
Could've brought us back together last June
When the last time was our last time
If only then I knew
The last time was our last time
Would've told you that the last time comes too soon
When the last time was our last time
Should've told you that the last time comes too soon

// Kiss Me (I Loved You) //

I swore I wouldn't do this
The wine's gone to my head
The ferryman's been stranded
Stay with me tonight instead

The end will not befall us
The sky will not descend
Life can be more sweet than bitter
If you'll only let me in

Kiss me
Kiss me
Like long ago
Kiss me
I still know
Our dream
Ended like dreams do
But kiss me
I loved you

I heard everything about you
And maybe half of it was true
Love is much less a mystery
Than who you give it to

Kiss me
Kiss me
Like long ago
Kiss me
I'm still yours
Baby
Our dream
Ended like dreams do
But kiss me
Don't you miss me?
Kiss me
I loved you

// (Everything But) Her Love //

Her parade on the ceiling
Was lookin' like rain
When he came by to borrow
Some blue sky
"I'm sleeping" she said
After a long nights dreamin'
Hard pressed for a reason
To get out of bed

Here he is beggin' for less than enough
I'll give you everything but
Her love
Ah-ah-ah
Everything but her love
Her love
Ah-ah-ah
Everything but her love

I can offer you sheets by the mile
If the Carlyle is out of rooms
I'm good for it
Why don't you ask?
But I can't bring her back

Now why would I do that?

When I ask what he wants
His only response
Is a single word less than I need
He watches TV
She reads the I Ching
And I keep my face nearly straight
When he tries to leave

She must be a dream, 'cause you never wake up
I'll give you everything but
Her love
Ah-ah-ah
Everything but her love
Her love
Ah-ah-ah
Everything but her love
Her love
Ah-ah-ah
Everything but her love
Her love
Ah-ah-ah
Everything but her love

// Q4 //

Simone writes little of much consequence
Unless the theater's how you pay the rent
A new work of some semi-memoir sits
Inside the weekend book editors desk
And while they have not mentioned it
She must watch roses get thrown at less
Oh, the indignity

It was just the thing for their Q4
"Deeply funny" was the rave refrain
It was just the thing for their Q4
It'll be on stands before the holidays

Her sister was not much long for this world
She danced as if a dancer danced as if
As if she had a body to sustain
As if an audience to entertain
This ironic distance kept her sane
While her vessel sailed away
It was all very literary
And the truth was

It was just the thing for their Q4
What's "deeply funny" mean anyhow?
It was just the thing for their Q4
These are the stories that we need right now

How could she compete?
(I'm sure she wouldn't mind)
With a memory such as she
(But who else than I)
Leigh died so many months ago
(Could write the story of her life?)
"By now this tragedy's my own!"
Oh, oh

It was just the thing for their Q4
"Deeply funny" was the rave refrain
It was just the thing for their Q4
It'll be on stands before the holidays
It was just the thing for their Q4
The film adaptation was a total mess
It was just the thing for their Q4
'Til she was outed for her privilege
It was just a thing for their Q4
Can't see her brother now unsupervised
It was just the thing for their Q4
Her family switched care right when she inquired

// Olvidado (Otro Momento) //

I have something to tell you
I can't use my hands to sign
Even if I could manage it, dear
I'm not sure I'd catch your reply

Olvídalo
Otro momento
Olvídalo
El destino decide

You're listening so intently
As on and on, I go
My flight's leaving at 7 AM
La noche casi se ha ido

Olvídalo
Otro momento
Olvídalo
El destino decide

All I want to say is words have failed me many times before
But never so completely as with you

// Funny Girl //

Funny girl
You look so unassuming
Right up until
The room you're captivating
Starts to fill with gut-busting laughter
And you're transformed into a five-foot Cleopatra

Funny girl
Your schedule's pretty crazy
Doing interviews
For the new live action, Cathy
Could you pencil in an industry outsider?
Yeah, you're young but, baby, you're not getting younger

Funny girl

For once, your timing wasn't great
I must have missed you by a day
But, baby, things have turned out pretty good this way
And I don't think either of us yearn to share the stage

Funny girl
You seem pretty indifferent
But you knocked me out
When you charmed the pants off Letterman
Oh, I wish you'd flash that manic smile in my direction
And let me lead you to your seat like we were old friends

Funny girl

// Only A Fool //

I was a fool to begin with
Long before this dance began
Oh, there's no mistakin'
What you're sayin' with that moony glance

Only a fool
Would understand

I was fool when I met you
And oh, I bet you knew it too
How else could we stay standin'?
All those nights dream-landin', ooh

Only a fool
Would understand

The wisdom of the ages
From the Gita to Abraham
Was written by smitten, lonely sages
Too wise to ever take a chance

Life could be cruel
Now and then
But I couldn't fathom way back when
How I'd long to have you break my heart
Time and again

Only a fool
Would understand

Only a fool
Would understand

// We Could Be Strangers //

She says, "The odds are against you
She won't break his heart"
He says, "You'll lose the one sooner or later
Just being who you are"

This conversation's at an impasse
Maybe the future will look brighter undressed

We could be strangers for one night longer
Save the trysts and tumors for tomorrow
'Cause no one's really better off
No one's really better off alone

She says, "No point speeding back to your place
I've got no other plans"
As they lay there bleeding on the freeway
He takes her by the hand

"I never wanted to disappoint you
At least I'll never even get the chance to"

We could be strangers for one night longer
Save the trysts and tumors
The nights at home

We could be strangers for one night longer
Leave the crazy highs and the crazy lows

We could be strangers for one night longer
Who any of us are, well
Nobody knows

'Cause no one's really better off
No one's really better off alone

// The Next 20th Century //

The nazis that we hired
For our wedding band
Played your anthem like I wasn't there
For the father/daughter dance
From the boondocks of Egypt
To the nosebleeds at Calvary
Recite your history of oppression, babe
While you are under me
There's no doubting the devotion my ancestors had for yours
Now we've got all the love to pay for like a thousand different wars

A square foot of empire
Around the peep show slot
I see an avatar of mercy
With the same damn jeembles that I got
The boss wants to be anonymous
The talent wants to be seen
We weren't paying for your body, lord
We were paying you to leave
Now who will watch the chorus line stretching from Reno to Rome
Listen, Cherry, I know you love me but say you love me 'fore you go

Val Kilmer had a wall length mirror just over there
Well, I'm sure he's someone else now
But he was Batman when he lived here
Maybe he's Yankee Zulu
Just waiting for the flood
And maybe Mac the Conqueror
With the severed head of love
I've seen him wearing aviators and a black baseball hat
Stalking airports 'cross the bardo quiet as a wildcat

The wheel is turning
From night into day
Everything's in transition
Everything must change
But none of us here
Will ever see the promised land
None of us here will be there for
Childhood's end
I see ya
You student debtors
In the watchtower overhead
Searchin' for headlights in the driveway
Crying "Dad, look what they did"
Just look
Even their romance made us masters and slaves
And now things keep getting worse while staying so eerily the same
Come build your burial grounds
On our burial grounds
But you won't kill death that way

I don't know bout you
But I'll take the love songs
And give you the future in exchange

I don't know 'bout you
But I'll take the love songs
If this century's here to stay
I don't know 'bout you
But I'll take the love songs
And the great distance that they came
