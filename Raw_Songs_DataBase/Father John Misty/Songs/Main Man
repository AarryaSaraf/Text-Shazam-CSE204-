Are you my main man
Are you now, are you now?
Are you my main man
Are you now, are you now?
Are you now?

Are you a God man
Are you now, are you now?
Are you a frog man
Are you now are you now?
Are you now?

Oh and heaven is hot babe
Ever so, ever so
And heaven is hot babe
Watch it glow, watch it glow
Watch it glow

Bolan likes to rock, yeah
Yeah he does, yes he does
Bolan likes to rock now
Yes he does, yes he does
Yes he does

Is there a sane man
Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere?
I got giraffes all up in my hair
And I don't care, I don't care
I don't care

And as a child I laughed a lot
Yes I did, yes I did
Now it seems I cry a lot
Oh tell me true don't you

And are you my main man
Are you now, are you now?
Are you my main man
Are you now, are you now?
Are you now?

Are you my main man
Are you now, are you now?
Are you my main man
Are you now, are you now?
Are you now?
