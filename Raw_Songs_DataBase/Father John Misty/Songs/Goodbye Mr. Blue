This may be the last time
The last time I put on my shoes
Go down to the corner
And buy the damn cat the expensive food

That Turkish Angora is 'bout the only thing left of me and you
Early this morning, it started making sounds that say
"Don't the last time come too soon?
One down, eight to go, but it's no less true
Don't the last time come too soon?"

This may be the last time
Last time I get out of bed
Put coffee on and try, in your words
"To show some initiative"

We used to lay around here laughing
At what these freaks out there were trying to prove
But what's wasting time if not throwing it away on work
When the last time comes so soon
Mr. Blue died in my arms, nothing they could do
Don't the last time come too soon

Love's always gonna leave ya
No matter what they say
You only know what it is once it's gone away

This may be the last time
The last time I lay here with you
Do you swear it's not the cat?
You don't have to answer that
I'll just make do
But maybe if he'd gone sooner
Could've brought us back together last June
When the last time was our last time
If only then I knew
The last time was our last time
Would've told you that the last time comes too soon
When the last time was our last time
Should've told you that the last time comes too soon
