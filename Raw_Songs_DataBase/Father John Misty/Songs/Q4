Simone writes little of much consequence
Unless the theater's how you pay the rent
A new work of some semi-memoir sits
Inside the weekend book editors desk
And while they have not mentioned it
She must watch roses get thrown at less
Oh, the indignity

It was just the thing for their Q4
"Deeply funny" was the rave refrain
It was just the thing for their Q4
It'll be on stands before the holidays

Her sister was not much long for this world
She danced as if a dancer danced as if
As if she had a body to sustain
As if an audience to entertain
This ironic distance kept her sane
While her vessel sailed away
It was all very literary
And the truth was

It was just the thing for their Q4
What's "deeply funny" mean anyhow?
It was just the thing for their Q4
These are the stories that we need right now

How could she compete?
(I'm sure she wouldn't mind)
With a memory such as she
(But who else than I)
Leigh died so many months ago
(Could write the story of her life?)
"By now this tragedy's my own!"
Oh, oh

It was just the thing for their Q4
"Deeply funny" was the rave refrain
It was just the thing for their Q4
It'll be on stands before the holidays
It was just the thing for their Q4
The film adaptation was a total mess
It was just the thing for their Q4
'Til she was outed for her privilege
It was just a thing for their Q4
Can't see her brother now unsupervised
It was just the thing for their Q4
Her family switched care right when she inquired
