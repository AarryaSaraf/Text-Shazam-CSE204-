Living it up
Have it all
Pull more women than any two men or train can haul
But my baby, she does something way more impressive than the Georgia Crawl
She blackens pages like a Russian romantic
Gets down more often than a blowup doll

Why the long face, Blondie? I'm already taken
Sorry
I may act like a lunatic
You think I'm fucking crazy, you're mistaken
Keep moving

On the road again
For months at a time
Doesn't take half that long for men about town to forget what's mine
Now my genius can't drink in silence
She's gotta listen to your tired-ass lines
I know it's hard to believe the good-hearted woman 
Could have a body that'd make your daddy cry

Why the long face, jerkoff? Your chance has been taken
Good one
You may think like an animal
If you try that cat-and-mouse shit, you'll get bitten
Keep moving
