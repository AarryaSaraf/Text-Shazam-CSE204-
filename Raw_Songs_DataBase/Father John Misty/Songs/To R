I found you once, and I'll find you again
Your cells are ringin' bells, singin', "God is dead"
God is dead, God is dyin'
The poison's in the dose, true
And I've had just enough of my fill of my failure to possess you
And for the second time today
I repeat something only we would say

Now is it true you're goin' out of your head?
Riskin' perfection with somebody else
Oh, no more ridiculous than life itself

Buddy, what's wrong? Like the of angel death
Stopped by to ask about the extra room you rent
It's not like you, tell him to leave
Did you really have to ask him in? Sing him to sleep
And are you really so surprised
At just what a lost man's love looks like?

Now is it true you're goin' out of your head?
Riskin' perfection with somebody else
Oh, no more ridiculous than life itself
Life itself
