People, we're only people
There's not much anyone can do, really do about that
But it hasn't stopped us yet
People, we know so little about ourselves
But just enough to wanna be nearly anybody else
How does that add up?

Oh, friends, all my friends
Oh, I hope you're somewhere smiling
Just know I think about you more kindly than you and I have ever been
And I'll see you the next time around the bend

People, what's the deal?
You've been hurt
And I've been hurt
But what do we do now?
People, we're only people
There ain't a thing one person can ever change about that

Oh, friends, all my friends
Oh, I hope you're somewhere smiling
Just know I think about you more kindly than you and I have ever been
And I'll see you the next time around the bend

I think the end of it all may look a lot like the beginning
Passed around from hand to hand
Screaming for no particular reason
The company gets pretty thin
So we start to shed all our distinctions
So why not me?
Why not you?
Why not now?
