I swore I wouldn't do this
The wine's gone to my head
The ferryman's been stranded
Stay with me tonight instead

The end will not befall us
The sky will not descend
Life can be more sweet than bitter
If you'll only let me in

Kiss me
Kiss me
Like long ago
Kiss me
I still know
Our dream
Ended like dreams do
But kiss me
I loved you

I heard everything about you
And maybe half of it was true
Love is much less a mystery
Than who you give it to

Kiss me
Kiss me
Like long ago
Kiss me
I'm still yours
Baby
Our dream
Ended like dreams do
But kiss me
Don't you miss me?
Kiss me
I loved you
