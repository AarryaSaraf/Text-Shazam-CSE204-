I know a few ten-cent words
I can break out to keep up with her
But you can take what I know about love
And drown it in the sink

I know my way around a tune
Won't be a single dry eye in a room
But you can take what I know about you
And maybe fill a small balloon

But I'm just dumb enough to try
To keep you in my life
For a little while longer
And I'm insane enough to think
I'm gonna get out with my skin
And start my life again

I'm no stranger to the female form
Oh, I've been here a few times before
Oh, but you could have me anytime
Everything's cool, I'm great, it's fine

Oh, but I'm just dumb enough to try
To keep you in my life
For a little while longer
And I'm insane enough to think
I'm gonna get out with my skin
And start my life again
