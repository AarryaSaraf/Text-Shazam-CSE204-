When I heard the ladiesman was dead
I saw the rolling stone stop moving
Saw my ancient hero on the Sunset Strip
He left behind a legacy of ruin

Now painted ladies want to hold my gun
Wonder if the whole time if I'd been acting
When I sang "Moon River" in that silent film
Had I really made a sound when they called action

I swear that man was womankind's first husband
They all died in a line to save him
I'm a steady hand, I'm a Dodger's fan
I'm a leading brand, I'm a one night stand
I'm a ladiesman

Only son of a ladiesman
Only son of a ladiesman

Couldn't see his used-up body at the funeral
By virtue of the flailing of his conquests
They tied down his casket with the garter belt
Each troubled heart was beating in a sequined dress

Someone must console these lonesome daughters
No written word or ballad will appease them
Cowboy and the cop shot down the ladiesman
The humid nights in L.A. are now silent
I swear that man was womankind's first husband

Only son of the ladiesman
Only son of the ladiesman
Only son of the ladiesman
