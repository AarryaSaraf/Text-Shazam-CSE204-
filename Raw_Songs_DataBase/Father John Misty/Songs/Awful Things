Julian is gonna take my files
Every woman that I've slept with
Every friendship I've neglected
Didn't come when grandma died
I spent my folk bucks getting drunk and high
I've done things unprotected
Proceeded to drive home wasted
Bought things to win over siblings
I've said awful things, such awful things

And now, now it's out
And now, now it's out

Julian he's gonna take my files
Telling people jokes to shut them up
Resenting people that I love
Sleep in til two then doing shit
Just stay in bed and later lie about it
Obsessing over graying hair
Knowing just what people wanna hear
Binging on unearned attention
I've said awful things, such awful things

And now, now it's out
And now, now it's out

I came by at seven in the morning
Seven in the morning, seven in the morning
I came by at seven in the morning
I said baby I'm finally succumbing
Said something dumb like I'm tired of running
Tired of running, tired of running
Let's put a baby in the oven
Wouldn't I make the ideal husband
