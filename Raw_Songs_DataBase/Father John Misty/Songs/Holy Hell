Hell
Holy hell, holy hell
Damn, the future ain't looking so bright
Never asked for a paradise
But seventy years would be nice
With my brothers and sisters and I
And the impossible dream of mankind
But I've always been the irrational type

Hell
What the hell, what the hell
This thing's got us all in its grip
The economy just don't explain this
This unfathomable, nameless rift
Who knows if it even exists
It just some highly effective rhetoric
Used by perverts who get off on it

But all my friends
Yeah, I'm talking to you
The world won't end unless we want it to
There's no one in control
And it's our life to choose
