I was a fool to begin with
Long before this dance began
Oh, there's no mistakin'
What you're sayin' with that moony glance

Only a fool
Would understand

I was fool when I met you
And oh, I bet you knew it too
How else could we stay standin'?
All those nights dream-landin', ooh

Only a fool
Would understand

The wisdom of the ages
From the Gita to Abraham
Was written by smitten, lonely sages
Too wise to ever take a chance

Life could be cruel
Now and then
But I couldn't fathom way back when
How I'd long to have you break my heart
Time and again

Only a fool
Would understand

Only a fool
Would understand
