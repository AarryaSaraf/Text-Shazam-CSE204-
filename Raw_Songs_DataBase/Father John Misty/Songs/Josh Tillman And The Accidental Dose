Around this time, I publicly
Well, nevermind, you can read
I was unwell, and suddenly
Her clown portraits spoke to me

You're in no shape
You're in no shape
All the kings horses, all the kings men
You may never be whole again

A publicist and a celibate started talking

All the kings horses, all the kings men
You may never be whole again

Dazed in the street
But it never taste quite as sweet
Again
Again
