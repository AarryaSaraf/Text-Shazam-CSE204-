It's less hard than it should be to find a dead guy dressed up as Batman
His penis out, with a magazine
And a Go-Gurt hanging out of his mouth but you know

We say "hey now, this is America"
We got some time to kill, and we need a thrill
So we die doing the dumbest of shit, here we go

We got people hanging out at abandoned malls
Trying to get the dead people to talk to 'em
With a little rigged up Bluetooth thing
With a feather kicking out of the back and you know

They got Go-Gurts, 'cause this is America
We got some time to kill, and we need a thrill
So we die doing the dumbest of shit, here we go

We got a guy going sixty on a six-foot unicycle
Gunning down a road that is made of gravel
And he's barreling towards a hanging bag
That is full of flaming Go-Gurts and now he is dead

I said, "Hey now, this is America"
