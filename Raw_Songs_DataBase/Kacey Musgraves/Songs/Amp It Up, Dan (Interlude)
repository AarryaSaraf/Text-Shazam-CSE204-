And so, Kacey had an emo moment in her bedroom
Because sometimes, just sometimes
A great singing career, a bunch of Grammys
And this over the top bathroom just aren't enough
Yet as Christmas Eve rolled on, would Kacey get ready in time?
Would she sing another holiday ditty that's overplayed in cafes and shopping mall restrooms?
And most importantly, would more celebrity friends continue to make surprise appearances that everyone sees coming but Kacey?
I don't know
Dan (Yes?)
Hey, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm just, um, I'm just freshening up in your bathroom
Look, if you could be just a little less negative when you narrate
That would be, that'd be nice
Wow, okay, um
It's Christmas, you know? We need Christmas cheer (Right)
Lots of cheer (Okay)
You know, happy...
You know, you're funny and that's kinda why we hired you, so, you know
So cheer then?
Cheer
For a corporate holiday in this political climate
Okay, sure, if cheer is what you want, Kacey
Then cheer is what you'll get
Thank you
Thank you
Right
Thank you so much, bye
Welcome back, friends!
Where was I? Oh right
It's Christmas Eve and Kacey still couldn't find her Nana's Christmas ornament
