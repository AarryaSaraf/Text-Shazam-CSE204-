I'm not afraid of a bite
I can take it
Watch how I bend
But I'm, I'm not breaking

I've been to hell and back
Golden hour faded black
Say that it ain't coming back
Ain't coming back

But you're gonna feel me
You're gonna feel me
You're gonna feel me
When I'm done
When I'm done
What doesn't kill me
What doesn't kill me
What doesn't kill me
Better run
Better run

I'm not afraid to connect with something real
And just let it go when I know
That it just don't fit in

I've been to hell and back
Golden hour faded black
Say that it ain't coming back
Ain't coming back

But you're gonna feel me
You're gonna feel me
You're gonna feel me
When I'm done
When I'm done
What doesn't kill me
What doesn't kill me
What doesn't kill me
Better run
Better run

What doesn't kill me
You're gonna feel me
What doesn't kill me
Better run
Better run
