Hey James. Oh hey Kacey. How ya doin'?
I'm good, but have you seen the weather outside?
It's snowing really hard, I wonder if it's gonna stop
I'll tell you one thing
As long as we're both nice and warm inside
It can snow out there as much as it likes
That's really true
It's really true
It's so true
It's so true
So true

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Oh my gosh
Sorry
Yeah, no, yeah
Should we-
No, let's just-
Okay
We'll-
Okay

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

I don't believe it! Oh my God, do you want me to help you?
No, I'm fine
Okay
Oh, I'm so s-, I gotta get that fixed. Is this, is this, you really do
I need to call the handyman. Do you know what? Maybe we should just, we'll um, you know, we'll, we'll move-
Let's move away, this way. We should go, we should go over here
Yeah, okay, um. Okay, you ready?
Okay
Okay

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh my God!
Go away, no you-
This your house?
Yes it is, yes, awkward. Get a refund! I'm so sorry, um- Okay, okay, yeah. Wow, what's, that's crazy, okay

Okay, you ready?

Okay, it's snow so it'll dissolve in your mouth. I got a, I got some, it's in there
It's okay?

Good, 'cause here we go

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbye-ing
(But) As long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow

My God, oh
You okay? You, are you okay?
I'm fine, are you good?
Yeah
You okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, let's-
Let's pick it up again and we'll carry on
Okay

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm (Crazy storm)
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Okay, okay
Yes
Alright
Okay

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it
Snow
Oh, come on!

Alright, thank you for being very nice, stand by
