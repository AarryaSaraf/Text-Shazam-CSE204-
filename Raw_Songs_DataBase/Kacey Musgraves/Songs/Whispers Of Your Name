Maybe I won't find
Any old love letters
Maybe I won't wish
You'd come down the hall
Maybe my picture frames
Won't look so empty
I have to take 'em down
Off the wall
Maybe the rain will come
After I'm sleeping
Maybe in my dreams
I won't feel this pain
Maybe I'll find my way
Back to morning
Without hearing whispers of your name
Maybe I'll find some things
To keep my mind busy
Maybe I'll sell this car
Sell this ol' ring
Maybe that'll be enough
To finally convince me
That you're not here
And I really don't have anything
Maybe I'll try
Try to get out some
Maybe our favorite places
Will still feel the same
Maybe when I sit alone
At our old table
I won't hear whispers of your name
I won't hear whispers of your name
