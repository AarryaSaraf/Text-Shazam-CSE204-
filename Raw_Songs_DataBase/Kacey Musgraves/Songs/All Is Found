Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a river full of memory
Sleep, my darling, safe and sound
For in this river all is found
All is found
When all is lost, then all is found

In her waters, deep and true
Lie the answers and a path for you
Dive down deep into her sound
But not too far or you'll be drowned

She will sing to those who'll hear
And in her song, all magic flows
But can you brave what you most fear?
Can you face what the river knows?

Until the river's finally crossed
You'll never feel the solid ground
You have to get a little lost
On your way to being found

Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a mother full of memory
Come, my darling, homeward bound
Where all is lost, then all is found

All is found
All is found
