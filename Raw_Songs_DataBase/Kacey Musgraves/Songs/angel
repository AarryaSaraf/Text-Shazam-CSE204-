If I was an angel
I wouldn't have to try
So hard to save you
Or show you how to fly

If I was an angel
I wouldn't get so mad
It'd be easy to be grateful
For everything I have
You'd only get the best of me

I'd pull you out of the darkness
Keep you out of the rain
Everything would be better
I'd never have to change
I'd never have to change

If I was an angel
I'd use only pretty words
And when I'm talking to you
It would never hurt
You'd only get the best of me
I'd never make you wanna leave

I'd pull you out of the darkness
Keep you out of the rain
Everything would be better
You'd never have to change
You'd never have to change

But something's gotta change

I'd pull you out of the darkness
Always keep you safe
Everything would be better
I'd never have to change
I'd never have to change
