When it rains it pours
But you didn't even notice
It ain't rainin' anymore
It's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of
Staying above
The rising water line

Well, the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
But, darling, I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

If you could see what I see
You'd be blinded by the colours
Yellow, red and orange and green
And at least a million others
So tie up the boat
Take off your coat
And take a look around

'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella
Well, darling, I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

Oh, tie up the boat
Take off your coat
And take a look around
Everything is alright now

'Cause the sky has finally opened
The rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
Let go of your umbrella
'Cause, darling, I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head
Yeah, there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head

It'll all be alright
