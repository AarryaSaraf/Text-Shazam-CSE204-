Woo!

You ran away to find something to say
I went astray to make it okay
And he made it easy, darlin'
I'm still in love and I say that because
I know how it seems between you and me
It hasn't been easy darlin'

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo
Burnin' the tears right out my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please don't leave me, leave me

I'm not a saint so just give me the blame
I know what I want and it gets in my way
I know I'm not easy, darlin'
(I'm kinda a freak, my darlin')
When you see me out
I hope the taste in your mouth
Is still as sweet as I wish it could be
Believe me, darlin'
Ay, yeah, yeah, yeah

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo
Burnin' the tears right out my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please don't leave me, don't leave me

We knew what was under the surface
And lived like it wouldn't hurt us
But it hurt us

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo
Burnin' the tears right out my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please don't leave me, no
Don't leave me

He made it easy
Please don't leave me
He made it easy
Please don't leave me
