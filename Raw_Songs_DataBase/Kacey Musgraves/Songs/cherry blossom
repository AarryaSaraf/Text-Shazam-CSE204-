Early April you walked up to me
Changing colors on city streets
Petals surrounding us in every shade of pink
We happened quickly as humans do
Summer was coming and change was too
Look at me now, I'm falling at your feet

I'm your cherry blossom baby
Don't let me blow away
I hope you haven't forgotten
Tokyo wasn't built in a day
I'm your cherry blossom baby
I don't wanna blow away

When we're on fire
It's something to see
No one can question the chemistry
Even in nature timing is everything

I'm your cherry blossom baby
Don't let me blow away
I hope you haven't forgotten
Tokyo wasn't built in a day
Yeah I'm your cherry blossom baby
I don't wanna blow away
Away
Away

I'm your cherry blossom baby
Don't let me blow away
I hope you haven't forgotten
Tokyo wasn't built in a day
I'm your cherry blossom baby
Don't wanna blow away
Away
Away
Away
Away
Away
