They make me clean up my room
And put away my toys
When company comes
I can't make any noise, oo-ah, ah-ah, ah-oh
They say I must take a bath
But I've had one before
I'm just so upset
I can't take anymore
Don't they remember
All the heartache so deep
When somebody tells you
It's time now for sleep, oo-ah, ah-ah, ah-oh
Please let me stay up too late
I don't wanna go to bed
I'm not even tired
I just wanna play instead
Won't somebody listen
To these feelings of mine
Can't anyone hear me
Or do I have to whine
I don't want to clean up my room
Don't wanna put away my toys
When company comes
I prefer making noise
I don't want any bath
Oh, and I never did
It's a difficult world
When your only a kid
Thank you, Goodnight
