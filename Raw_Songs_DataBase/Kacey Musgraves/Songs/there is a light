There is a light
At the end of the tunnel
There is a light
Inside of me

Tried not to show it
To make you feel good
Pretended I couldn't
When you knew that I could

I won't cry
When the cold wind blows
Gonna let it shine
'Cause now I know

There is a light
At the end of the tunnel
There is a light
Inside of me
There was a shadow of a doubt
But baby it's never going out
There is a light
Inside of me

There is a light

There is a light
It's so bright
But I've been hiding it
There is a light
Inside of me
There is a light

There is a light inside of me, uh huh
There is a light inside
There is a light

Oh, there is a light
Oh
There is a light

There is a light inside of me, uh huh
There is a light inside
There is a light

There is a light inside of me, uh huh
There is a light inside
