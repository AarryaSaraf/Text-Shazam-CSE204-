Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd
Mosaic ceilings, painted tiles on the wall
I can't help but feel someone like my body marred my soul
Handmade beauty, sealed up by two man-made walls
And I'm like

When's it gonna be my turn?
When's it gonna be my turn?
Open me up, tell me you like it
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd

There's a girl that sings Hotel California
Not because she loves the notes or sounds, the sound that floated out
It's because she's in a world preserved, only a few have found the door
It's like Camarillo, only silver mirrors running down the corridor
Oh, man

When's it gonna be my turn?
Don't forget me
When's it gonna be my turn?
Open me up, tell me you like me
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd
Don't forget me
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd

Harry Nilsson has a song, his voice breaks at 2:05
Something about the way he says, "Don't forget me"
Makes me feel like
I just wish I had a friend like him, someone to give me fire
Leaning in my back, whispering in my ear
"Come on, baby, you can drive"
But I can't

When's it gonna be my turn?
Don't forget me
When's it gonna be my turn?
Open me up, tell me you like it
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd

Don't forget me
At the tunnel under Ocean Blvd
Don't forget me
At the tunnel under Ocean Blvd
Don't forget me
At the tunnel under Ocean Blvd

Don't forget me, don't forget me
No, no, no, don't forget me
Don't you, don't you forget me (No, oh)
