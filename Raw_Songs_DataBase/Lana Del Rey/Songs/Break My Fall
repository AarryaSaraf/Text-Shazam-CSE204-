The greatest line in history:
Baby it's not you, it's me
What you think I'm dumb, dumb, baby doll?
I'm big enough and bad enough
And I can tell when things get rough
Now nothing that you say can break my fall

Oh, oh
Stop right there
Oh, oh
If you really care

Don't go and blow it all, it's bad enough baby
I don't wanna hear you saying it's not you, it's me
If there's blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you're done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There's nothing you can say to break my fall

Greatest lie in history:
Baby it's not you, it's me
Do you really think I'll buy your bullshit boy?
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
Give a girl her self respect
You haven't gone and hurt me yet
But you know that I'll crumble if you call

Oh, oh
Stop right there
Oh, oh
If you really care

Don't go and blow it all, it's bad enough baby
I don't wanna hear you saying it's not you, it's me
If there's blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you're done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There's nothing you can say to break my fall

Break my fall
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I'm not gonna let you become a martyr
Not gonna let you pick up the gun
I'm gonna make this a whole lot harder
Won't make it easy for you to run
I'm not gonna let you become a martyr
Not gonna let you pick up the gun
I'm gonna make this a whole lot harder
Won't make it easy for you to run

Don't go and blow it all, it's bad enough baby
I don't wanna hear you saying it's not you, it's me
If there's blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you're done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There's nothing you can say to break my fall
Don't go and blow it all, it's bad enough baby
I don't wanna hear you saying it's not you, it's me
If there's blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you're done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There's nothing you can say to break my fall
