The minute you walked in the joint

Good looking, so refined
Say, wouldn't you like to know what's going on

Cash rules, my flash jewels are monumental
Brass fools just act cool with what credentials?

Linguistics, bling bling ish, naughts and Gs
Brushing shoulders with movers, shakers and bosses

The streets knows I keep dough
Lace you with peep-toes and neat clothes
How better could it get, competition are bluffing

Ain't nothing that no dude can show you

Keys to convertibles that I place in your palm
Links of London and the Tiffany that I place on your arm, I'm a (spender)

Big stones, and cribs, homes, the high life
Big shows and whips, those that I like
