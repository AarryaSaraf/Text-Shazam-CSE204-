You my Axl Rose husband
Blue hydrangea
White Pontiac heaven
Me your red, white and blue girl
Star spangled danger
You my heavy-metal king, king

I said, "Daddy, I need you" (yes)
Greenwich, I need you
Strangled up in ivy
I'm the garden of Eden
Lady Liberty
Teal whip flame I'm shinin'
Queen, queen

You're my one king daddy
I'm your little queen
Red, white, and blue

You're my one king daddy
And I'm your little queen
Red, white and blue
White and blue
(White and blue)
(White and blue)

Record executive I
Need you to live, I
Someone come replace you
Should I happen to meet you
Downtown, or see you
I would fall down dead
I'm bereaved by you
Bereaved by you

In blue denim I meet you
Barefoot I need you
Diamond horseshoe sparkling
You're my king Jewish maven
Kids on vacation
Florida Keys are calling
Come back to me
Come back to me
