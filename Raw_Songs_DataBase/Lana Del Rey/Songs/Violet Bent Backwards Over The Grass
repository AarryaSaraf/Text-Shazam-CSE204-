I went to a party
I came in hot
Made decisions beforehand
My mind made up
Things that would make me happy
To do them or not
Each option weighed carefully
A plan for each thought
And then I walked through the door past the open concept
And saw Violet bent backwards over the grass
Seven years old with dandelions grasped tightly in her hand
Arched like a bridge in a fallen handstand
Grinning wildly like a madman
With the exuberance that only doing nothing can bring
Waiting for the fireworks to begin
And in that moment I decided to do nothing about everything
