He drive up in a summer sky, blue Bentley
Death reflecting in his eyes
Thought about all the women who loved me
I said, "Oh no!"
He said, "Get inside"
I said, "Oh no!"
He said, "Get inside"

I got into his summer sky, blue Bentley
Sun reflecting in my eyes
Thought about all the fun I had lately
I said, "Uh huh" I said "I want to drive"
I said, "Uh huh I want, I want to drive"
We drive, we drive

You say you wanna go swimming in my ring
It's green and shimmering
Like my lipstick, the color of dawn
Like my lipstick, the color of dawn
We got out of his summer sky, blue Bentley

Death reflecting in the sky
He held my hand to the ocean he lead me
I said, "Uh huh, I want, I want to die"
"Uh huh, I want, I want to die."
