Everybody's girl
What's the point in
Being everybody's girl?
Maybe you think that way
There's no chance getting hurt
Living for no one cost me way
More than it's worth

So you're gonna be a singer
Well I'll be goddamn
You're as pretty as a postcard
No thank to the old man
It's the same coat I had on
The night that I went in
I can stay an hour at Canter's
The streets cool off by then

When can I see you again?
Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Everything you want
What's the fun in getting
Everything you want?
I wouldn't know but, look
Baby you should try
Forget that lefty shit
Your mom drilled in your mind

Give the world a new savior
Sell his pictures to the press
Buy a place out in the country
Leave this world for
Someone else
My destruction is an hour late
I'm at Buddy's Rendezvous
Telling the losers
And old-timers
How good I did with you
They almost believe me too
Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news
Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Whatever happened
Whatever happened
