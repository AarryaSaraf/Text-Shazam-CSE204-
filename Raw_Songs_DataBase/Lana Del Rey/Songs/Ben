Ben's song, another try
Not that you deserve it right now, Ben
No faculties to care and all
But I deserve it, I deserve it, I know
(We can quibble over the history once we make it)
Right?

Lie down, my sad executive love, lie down
Right now, my man, bored out of his head, right now
Fans turn on a May night
Darkness assumes the room
Lie back, he does, in the late night
Hands folded back
Certain of doom
Hold me he sang "Hallelujah"
The midnight's became my noon
You don't know what you do, do ya?
I am on fire for you
I'm on fire, I'm on fire

Lie down, my sad executive love, lie down
Right now, my man, bored out of his head, right now
Fans turn on a May night
Darkness assumes the room
Hold me, hmm
Hold me he say "Hallelujah"
The midnight's became my noon
You don't know what you do, do ya?
I am on fire for you
I'm on fire, I'm on fire

Lie down, my sad executive love, lie down
I can smoke if I want to
I can dance if I want to
Yeah, it's true I want you
But don't say you don't want no harm
If you can't understand
'Cause I won't be here long enough for you to be my man

It's not a very nice ending, but that's what you get, just kidding

God bless America
Land that I love
Stand beside her
And guide her
I don't know anything, hm

There you are
