Uh, what? Starz, Starz
Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey
Sing it to me, sing it to me

You're so easy to love
You make me cuckoo like a turtle dove
So hot that I can't get enough, enough of you
Hit me and it felt like a kiss
You know it hurts so good, when you do me like this
So sad when I hear the girls talk
When I walk by, I start to cry-y-y

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause you're a beautiful player
You're a beautiful player, baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah, ah
(Sing it to me, doll)

Sunset on a Saturday night
Having a drop-top 'bach-ride time of our lives
He's selling souls on the boulevard of broken dreams
And faded queens
Live young like we oughta die fast
'Cause he's been breaking the law and he's not going back (going back)
I love him violently all through the night
And yes it's true, I live for you-oo-oo

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause you're my beautiful player
(Sing it to me)
You're my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh, oh, yeah

L is for your love that you gave and took away
O is for the only one I wanted to stay
V is for my valiant Valium baby
E is for the X that we took with champagne

I don't wanna leave, I just wanna breathe
I drive 'em crazy, baby girl, just being me
I'm not selfish, I can't help it
I was playing the cards I was dealt-ed
The name Starz got a lot of love to give
Riding down Broke Dream Boulevard in the Benz
How you love that? I think too much
A thin line between insanity and true love

Hit me and it felt like a kiss
Baby if it don't hurt, then I'll have to insist
We have just one life to live
But true love's more than he can give

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause he's my beautiful player
He's my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah, ah

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause he's my beautiful player
(Sing it to me)
He's my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh, oh, yeah
