Carry me up them stairs
With my white socks on
And my pretty song
You like my blue nail polish?
What is all this? You said
Of the mess upstairs
Don't be scared

Daddy dearest, you know
How I like to take trips
Pops, first stops at the K-Mart, buy me my peach lip-gloss
Cigarettes and lollipops
For our trip across the USA

We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Gonna party like it's 1949

Carry me up the stairs
With my white socks on
And my blonde hair long
You like my pin-up bodice and the solace
That comes with the midnight air
And my icy stare

It's the clearest when it's me and him alone
He stops, he talks about all the ways he used
To about all ways he used to 
Dinerettes and soda pops for our trip across the USA

We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Gonna party like it's 1949

Daddy likes Blackpool Pleasure Beach and road stops
Me, I like the Swiss Alps souvenir gift shops
Late night, midnight radio show talks
Him and me, a big jailbreak

Ponytail and lollipops, dinerettes and soda pops
New blue bathing suit, ruched tops and Cadillacs
Blue lake, Carter Docks, hopscotch, hot talk
Alabama hard knocks, motel brass locks
