// Is It Love //

[Angela McCluskey (Kendrick Lamar):]
Sit still and close your eyes (smoke to it)
What's behind the other door? Oh-ohh
No more silence (no more silence)
Don't kill this thing we got called love (don't shoot)
Just searching for the perfect shot

[Angela McCluskey:]
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Kendrick Lamar (Angela McCluskey):]
I used to write rhymes all day and all night
When y'all was playing PlayStation, my pencil was erasing lines
My conscience only knew what's half-tight
At 3:14, it's time to get me a slice my nigga
This is a dog's fight my nigga
The soundtrack to life my nigga
Kendrick Lamar, his momma called him that
He watched House Party and ate Apple Jacks
Sold Sega games, his cousin sold crack
He pumped Reeboks, his uncles pumped packs
Pump fake, jump-shot, ball hit the back
Board dreams of being point guard was off limits Jack
That's because these Compton streets was built not to win
You killed the nigga, I stole a bible, is that a sin?
Pardon me though, I'm searching for answers (just searching for the perfect shot)
The good kid from the ugly city, he's mad that he's handsome
Where is the love?

[Angela McCluskey (Kendrick Lamar):]
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away (where is the love?)
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Kendrick Lamar (Angela McCluskey):]
Give me rings, give me chains mane
Give me a blue Benz, red Porsche, red Range
Give me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes
A mansion with marble floors and security codes
Then give me some landa, or maybe I'll land a
G5, clear port, say hello to the man
Give me awards, Grammies, and let the crowd applaud
My name 'til they strain the veins and their vocal cords
Give me fame and fortune, me and Trump on golf courses
With that being said, give me Tiger's sports endorsements
Give me billboards, whatever that people will kill for
Manhattan and 40/40, no forties but Rose poured
Give me vanity, give me Kurt Cobain sanity
Give me a city where Channel 7 newscasters' cameras be
Give me horror like Amity, no, give me the charts (just searching for the perfect shot)
And if you ever renege, I'll still give you Kendrick Lamar
This is me, and that's love

[Angela McCluskey:]
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Now everybody smoke to it
For this is, the celebration

// Celebration //

For the record, I used to do a lot of humping when I was little
I got a lot of whoopings over that shit too, and that's random, but so what? Ha-ha-ha

Gimme that beat, fool
This a full time jack, no really this a Soundwave track
So really I ain't gotta steal nothing all I gotta do is kill it when you press record button let the paralyzed feel it
I came back with a full time swag and the critics thought they had me
Nah, I just bought more batteries
Turned up supercharged, a medium away from livin' large
Matter fact, where my niggas at?
Where my bitches with them pretty weaves?
Enemies bleed on the maxi pad, pussy you fucked with the wrong one I'm on one I'll make sure your kids breathe pneumonia
Good kid, mad city evil in my heart from the blood niggas fuckin' with me crip niggas tryna kill me
Malcolm X mind state, if I raise the crime rate, it's a legitimate reason why I put on repeat Kanye's "Touch The Sky"
But I'll be looking past that I'm tryna touch God
My heart to the heavens, the rebel of the reverend
Ya'll married to the game well I'm 'bout to crash weddings
I put a lot of pain in the shit I write
If you goin' through something, this is shit you recite
This is bigger than life
This is Kendrick Lamar
This is Jimi Hendrix guitar on tour, bonjour I mean war like that
Yeah, straight like that

People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)

In 2010 I'm tryna ball, nigga!
Like shooting jumpshots in the mall, nigga!
That's a quote from Ab-Soul I suppose since you laugh that's the ultimate goal
On behalf of the Top Dawg conglomerate
Shall stay anonymous
Searchin' seven continents accomplishing big shit
Big ass, big tits she on me
And just to get to me she'll fuck the homies-homie's homies
The life of a cool nigga
My nigga Tony said "just do you, nigga!"
Sure improve, nigga
And they gon' play you for a fool that's for sure 'til they know you got the stinkiest stool, nigga!
I ain't trippin' I'm just tippin' on fo-fo's back in the city and tippin' on four hoes
That boy got a cold cold
He's sick con, slick on
Drop red jewels like a school bar mitzvah
Ooh
Straight like that

People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)

Why ya'll complain about OGs?
I don't look at a legend and say you owe me
Not Snoop not Dre not Ice Cube
I don't care me and Quik went to the same school
I look in the mirror and do it myself like a self made nigga
I don't need a maid, nigga
Do I need a co-sign from Dre or Jigga?
They can make me much bigger, but do I need 'em though?
I just need a flow
The type of shit that make you think you seen Pac ghost "Me Against The World" on you motherfuckers
I got my back against the wall and a .45, dog get smoked, Chris Tucker
Uh, tryna record my steelo
Even when I'm not there just like TiVo
The hoes tell me that I got a real big ego
And weed move slow right now but E go
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
I look at your Audemars to put ya'll in time out
It's time to unveil the real and your career's 'bout as frail as Ms. Winehouse
Just salute, grab a flute and pull the wine out
Ooh, just like that

People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)

// P & P //

Oh what up, ho? Oh, what up?
I said oh, what up, ho? Oh, what up?
I said oh, what up, ho? Oh, what up?
Well, alright

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than society's
Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a 9 to 5, fresh out of school that was '05
That bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then I had no job
Pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association story of my life, nigga
You gone make me flip then split your shit, judge give me life, nigga
Pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louis's Burgers
Hold my tears I tried my best, let it go drench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin's margin
Maintaining my modest, modest as I dream
So while I go through all this, all this bullshit what you call it
Life itself I know it helps let me scroll through my Blackberry

Hey, what's up, daddy?
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

I said keep reading my diary, when my life's entirely
Surrounded by the irony of living in the city
I said they wouldn't hire me, I said I got my ass beat
And the only thing can help is ass and some titties

So what's up, baby? I said what's up?
I had a long day and I really wanna fuck

See I ain't tryna think about no phone bills
Credit card late fees, Capital One popping up on my caller ID
Pawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow-tip shots
Watching my vehicle break down on another man's block
Man that's my worst fear, ain't that your worst fear

You know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears
Or run through a pothole at two in the morning
Scared to hit your emergencies 'cause then they'll be on it
See I know when the harsh reality take its toll
Open up your contacts then scroll

Hey, what's up daddy
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

[Ab-Soul:]
Welcome to my diary. Hmm, where should I begin?
Finna get a Swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step, better yet they work my every nerve
Cutting me this worthless check, the concept is so absurd
Like a church in debt, a turtle in a turtle neck
Convertibles with turbojets, fueled by 7-Up and prometh'
I feel like deaths around the corner like the quickest wide receiver
So I took another shot, Tequila hit me like a nina
My sky's gray, my bitches brighter
Always saying lights please, J. Cole's her ghost writer

And I'm the God MC, join my diocese
Free your mind, don't mind society
And finally, everyone got their own problems
Everything is subject to change like broken dollars
I'ma drown in my drink and swim in my woman's vagina
Like a piranha fin, it gets harder than Rihanna when

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that's some great advice

// She Needs Me //

One time, reporting live, Compton, California

[Kendrick Lamar:]
She go to work, she go to school, her body smooth, no tattoos
Type of girl that'll make your mother feel comfortable
My pops love her too, she's compatible, she's independent
She handle her business, she believe in God and no other religions
She's never in competition, when it comes to her friends, she's dependable
She set her own trends, a confidant, a mediator, so sweet, every flavor
Just a conversation with her doing you a favor, look at her hips, I want to be her pager
Conservative, affirmative, actually she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
The beauty of her, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
The beauty of her, swear to God, a blind man can see, a true queen and she needs me

[JaVonté:]
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Five years later, an accounting major, work at a firm
Abundance of paper, she got a career, she look in the rear
View mirror of a Mercedes that she can steer
Call her boss, executive meetings, consecutive trips, vacational weekends
Dior reeking through her Prada dress, probably the only product of her pure success
Got a promotion, now she own the building
Headed to the top like she on the building, real estate, property
She order tender steak, only one mouth to feed, funded a youth center
Invested in some stock, doubled what she put in, then bought a restaurant
Oh what a girl, how great life can be, even though she got the world, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
Oh what a girl, wonder how her life can be, and though she got the world, she needs me

[JaVonté:]
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on

[Kendrick Lamar:]
We lose touch, separated, years pass, I'm outdated
She's dating one of Hollywood's famous entertainers, Denzel good
Paparazzi spot 'em out shopping, Tuesday morning brunch, Benihana's
Tabloids paint a picture of a perfect couple
Headline reads when a famous actor loves you, Emmy Awards, Academy too
On the red carpet, dress matching his suit, she holding his arm
She waves at her moms and wave at the world, got the world in her palms
Head in the clouds, star gazing, caught her on the stage, a proposal was waiting
He bent down, got on one knee, she looked him in the eye and said she needs me
She needs me, she needs me, she needs me, she needs me
Even if we seem to separate, eventually it'll come to pass, and she'll need me
I need her, we need we

[JaVonté:]
That girl is smoking, and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open, and together we are roller-coasting on

// I Am (Interlude) //

See y'all don't understand me
My plan B is to win ya hearts before I win a Grammy
Kendrick Lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
Marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You can't 'cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
I'm on point like period
I've been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee, that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
Family, God and honor
From Chicago, my daddy and my mamma
Came to Compton to accomplish one thing
Raise a king, reign supreme, named Kendrick
I ain't lying, it stand for king and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
From the coochie to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well I've had this world since birth
Feel the good kid's hunger
The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
Muscle in my heart
Stare at the eyes of Mozart, then tell him I'm the genius
Do my dougie and grab my penis
'Cause I means this with all my soul
And you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of Satan
But even that can't stop it
Nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it ain't, you may offend me
Damn that boy good
Bright as Thomas Edison, but Gucci man hood
He stood alone for so long
Prolonged his whole career, but now he's here
You can shoot shots or cheer 'cause I... am

// Wanna Be Heard //

It's like I don't think you fully understand who I am, ya know?
I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
I don't represent no colors, I represent my lil' sisters and brothers
I'm the oldest, nigga
And if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Check it out

I used to wanna rap like JAY-Z
Until I finally realized that Jay wasn't me
I took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable
Critics say I don't be killing this shit but I know I do
Because I used to practice early morning and then after school
I'm working on my hooks my nigga, I ain't tryna battle you
But even if I did, I guarantee I'd overshadow you
Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
I'mma close cut to Common and Gucci Mane
Now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand
Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
As an '87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rear-view mirror
I wear a heart on my shoulder
'Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola?
Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
Then went to jail when we got older
That shit is a bad odor, but still I remain focused
In due time, I'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline
That shit's embarrassing huh
Hope no one pay you no mind
But it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
Can you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreams
And admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen?
My mamma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio
Even though she know her tank is empty, that's who I do it for
My pops got a different approach, yeah he believed
But he always questioned when I'mma drop my debut CD
How long this gon' take nigga? You still haven't ate nigga
At twenty-two I had two cars and my own place nigga
It's a sacrifice I try to tell him
That's when he turn to BET and tell me that he jealous
Of all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shit
I ain't tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit
I just wanna hear you heard

Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard

What up DZYNE? I ain't forgot nigga
You developed me, telling me I was hot nigga
You believed in me first, that's what's for sure
At the church recording, at the garage, but it worked
But me and Dave kind of felt you lost the passion
A lot was going on in your life and you needed space
But still I should have came to you first to tell you what happened
But I was seventeen and figured it's best I stay away
And I was wrong, I was young and couldn't look you in the eye for what I'd done
But I'm telling you we ain't done
Matter of fact, how's your sons? What they up to?
Remember they used to run away while you had worked on ProTools?
People I used to be in the booth 'til four in the morning
With school in the morning, yawning, but I was on it
Me, you and Dave was on it
Buzzing like Charlotte Hornets when that tape dropped
Where them beats nigga? It's been five years since we had rocked
Time to be heard

Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard

So can you feel it?
When you hear it do it pulsate your spirit?
Do it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick?
The truth can set you free if you Do the Right Thing
Word to Spike Lee, don't he look like Sounwave?
That's kinda random, but my humor sometimes strays
Like a dog in the night
Twenty-four hours in a day but only take five minutes
To grab a pad and a pen, then send your dog a kite
I spread love like a hippy, but I'm a black one
With Jesus Christ passion, I swear on the bible
Tabernacle to all my rivals, I ain't mad
You hate a nigga for tryna help you, that's your bad
Because I figure I can make a way with these stanzas
I probably can't heal cancer, but I can heal the city
My niggas, tell me you with me
And if you is won't you pop my CD in
Open up your trunk, then let it bump, so I can be heard
Yeah, uh huh

Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (Man, I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I be up, cooking up all day
Like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard

D-Dave, what up nigga?
Matt Jeezy, ha ha ha

// I Do This //

[Kendrick Lamar:]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!

Uh, I used to wanna be like Michael Jordan
Figured that I hit the NBA and make a fortune
Thank God for these rap recordings
I can ball like him on every verse and chorus
501s, Louis Letterman jacket
Little brother only 5, mamma put him on my taxes
You know that Compton ghetto shit
That every section 8 tenant is familiar with
Ooh wee, they say he something like the 70s
But I'm from '87, with a thousand dimes
You got 80 sevens
Gourmet sneakers, hair nappy
Fucking all my high school teachers
That was '05 bro
And I don't like 'em if the ass thin
And I don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend
The fuck I look like?
A million bucks, and that's why

The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it (Ho)
Uh, so give me fifty-feet champ
Run until I got a bunion and my feet cramp
I'm in the hot spot, I know their seats damp
And I don't need your cosign, that's a cheap stamp
You-you niggas check this cash and I'm GT-crashing
105 off-ramp, hey
And little nigga got it going on, G5
Going, going, going, gone
Cloud-9 mind state
I drop a record then I raise the crime rate
Killing this shit, where's your funeral tie?
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, fuck skip to Y

The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

[Jay Rock:]
She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it
First off I'm a rider, bitch
Put them 26s on a Silverado, bitch
I keep my bitch with a finer bitch
Snap my fingers, she'll go find a bitch
Tell them fuck boys that I do this
Got the best product 'round town, Frank Lucas
Confuse 'em like a Rubik's Cube when I roll up
OK, "Subway" bread like some cold cuts
And I drop cold cuts, bitches go crazy
Wild like a Haitian, I should set up shop in Haiti
Fuck you, pay me. Paper over pussy, nigga
When I drop you ain't getting paper nor pussy, nigga

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition of cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

// Uncle Bobby & Jason Keaton //

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I was sitting on the couch reading yellow paper
A letter in reply, 7 days later after I wrote 'em
"Stay strong, keep your faith in God," what I told him
Hoping that he's listening
Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
What a coincidence, I was bumping some Plies
I can taste the salt from my tears
As the water had start to flood on my eyes
I know it gotta be hard being 21
Doing time in the pen and your Gram's old
Your brother's getting older
And the streets is getting colder
And your hoping that he's focused to stay on the right road
Sleeping in a cell, it's been 30 weeks
Ain't received any mail
It's cold and the hole stinks
And you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
As I read every word that you write, I can only imagine
Jason Keaton, I can only imagine

[Javonte:]
Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Sitting on the couch, that was my Uncle Bobby
After he just got out, 15 years to count
Haven't seen the world in so long
Haven't seen a girl in so long
And before the sun came up, he was gone
Like a fiend off the best rock
Trying to get his life together, or what not
Typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
Got it straight, got a place, found some serenity
Found a job, found his mother's grave site, found a 40 ounce
Then he found God, then he bounced, then he found a new chick
Two kids, wide hips, found something in her we didn't see
Found this spot in Pasadena and shack with her, an investment
Then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic
Violence on my Uncle, was working with two strikes
Only out a year, now facing life
I can only imagine
That's fucked up
I can only imagine, Uncle Bob

[Javonte:]
Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Sitting on the couch, thinking about the ratio
Of blacks in prison as compact in prison
When blacks pack with minorities
System grab more of these 18-year-olds
18-year sentence with no parole
The state won't oversee
They make the term severe, a conspiracy?
That's what I call it, it's full of shit
A toilet can help quick, the government help?
No, just put us on death row
Just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke
Then give us another chair, then give us some more rope
Then hang it like right there, yeah
It's justice for all but 90 percent unfair
Care? No
Alcatraz was purchased by a white man
For 5 grand, with intentions to expand
More prisons
So these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation
They for grossing a bigger business
Imagine
We're being used
Imagine
The truth shall be told

[Javonte:]
Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it

// Faith //

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Cloud nine, Kendrick Lamar, uh
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
To witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I start questioning God, "What is my purpose?"
He said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian
And this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
Then lost my faith again

[BJ The Chicago Kid:]
What am I gonna do?
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up don't you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards 'cause, papa, they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids, so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't 'bout shit, that nigga ain't 'bout shit
Spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night, hoping that he'll mature
And maybe one day his kids something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school, but she need some help
Because it's hard tryna pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice
That said, "The Devil is a lie, make a better choice."
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
With them crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and aksed Him to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her Section 8
Then lost her faith again

[BJ The Chicago Kid:]
What am I gonna do?
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up, don't you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

[Punch:]
Kendrick, I appreciate the opportunity to vent my nigga
This about how faith works, yeah, murk it
I had dreams of holding a 9 milla to Ray's killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
It's jungle when the niggas in zoo
The rats lurking, vultures circling the serpents
Cats lying through their teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the idea of caressing the steel
To make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach Cloud 9, that's what my niggas 'bout
But it never rain in California 'less them pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience 'til my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Ray Charles voice

[BJ The Chicago Kid:]
What am I gonna do?
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up, don't you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

[Kendrick Lamar:]
This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering, "Is there really a god?"
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and tryna freeze your brain
But whenever there's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
'Cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
At the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know when you feeling that way His Spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
And wonder why I ain't ever caught that feeling before
Maybe they know Him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know, is that He's real and He lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because He's testing your faith again

I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
Than die and find out there really is
Think about it

// Trip //

"Boarding completed
I'd like to welcome you aboard flight number F2B3
Our scheduled flying time will be four hours and twenty minutes
And we will be cruising at an altitude of thirty-three-thousand feet
At this time we would like to acquaint you with some of the features
Relax and breathe normally"

Uh, coming down like I'm uphill
Hogging both lanes better than a bus will
She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel
But it don't matter 'cause she still gon' let me fuck still
I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather
Then step out like Chicago in its finest era
You niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra
Downgrading yourself, you get an F for effort
Ha-ha, I let the world know
I chose to keep to myself and let the world go
And if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know
So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up
I'm laid back with a bad one, you ain't never had one
Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston
Speeding on the 1-0-5 'til the fucking badge come
Hello to my wittiness, I'm Cadillac's grandson

And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we 'bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
'Cause I'm a trip

Landing on another runway, fly with me
Or die tryna fly, a shot-down Frisbee
Shout out to Black Hippy, nigga we on
Like we never been off, straight shots of Patron
I'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business
Pussy ain't shit, I can give y'all some bitches
Clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes
Then wear off the Kangols, hood rats, I hate those
And she know what this is, hey lil' mama
Seen your pretty ass around the way lil' mama
But why you always in somebody face lil' mama?
Embarrassing yourself, get off the stage (Lil Mama)
Nigga, I gotta be that nigga
If I ain't, I gotta beat that nigga
Courtesy of Paula's oldest son, pay homage
Or pay attention, open your eyes and hear knowledge

And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we 'bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
'Cause I'm a trip

Gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that
That's how I get at 'em when I look at a shoe rack
Penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks
So I can live on a hill just off a few raps
I want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit
That might be outer space, the Jupiter district
I quadruple my vision
If you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open
I've seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smoking
On some Compton shit
Somebody that'll ride or die, that's a Compton bitch
You see my city is the city of Lamar
It'll take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all
The swap meet dumping, the sawed-off pumping
The tree for the low, don't you know, Paul Bunyan
I'm on cloud nine, I can see rain coming
So if I'm out my mind, people don't say nothing

And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we 'bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
'Cause I'm a trip

"How was your flight Mr. Lamar?
Good. Hope to see you next time"

// Vanity Slaves //

Uh-uh-uh, what up?
Uh, I'm tryna, what up?
Uh-uh, I'm tryna get something
Uh-uh-uh, I'm tryna, what up?
I say, what up?
Uh-uh, I'm tryna

Sometimes I wanna leave, sometimes I wanna cry
Sometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I wanna lie
Sometimes I wanna school the youth, sometimes I wanna ride
Sometimes I wanna not think, sometimes I wanna vibe
Sometimes I wanna bump Tribe and zone out, this song's 'bout a young boy
That's going wild inside, when my world collide
With your world where your girl and your kids reside
We kill the facades, we feel free to fly
We're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
I care about my pride too much, if my clothes is new
If my ride is plush, if my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed
I look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong
Insecurity roams the black community
Homes where kids must have jewelry
The high school female need earrings and details
So she can be cool to be amongst popularity
The various name brands that reached the price scan
It's not about the right price, but more like the right scam
To rule us all, confuse us all
Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
Now let's draw the picture of a rapper with a chain
And a Range that is not paid for
My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house
That lives around his neck like a white collar
So why fast forward? Then I rewind
A time machine can help me double back to slavery times
Picking cotton from a field that a white man own
The blacker you are, farther you're from the white man's home
Negro spiritual songs gave us some type of sanity
Before your vanity they parted our families
They put us in hundred-degree shade, and outside we bathed
The more we were afraid, the more they made rules
And trapped our minds in a cage, our freedom was so vague
Couldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross, uh!
And school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts
And a smirk could get you hurt, wounded first from a scar
Four-hundred years of nothing, four-hundred years of suffering
Four-hundred years of tears and tribulation, miseducation
See what we facing is now coming back to the roots
Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot?
Call us niggers and figured that we never live in pursuit
Of happiness, we're capturing these feelings in things that we do
Thought it's abstinence in slavery, but we made it come to
A modern perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie
Her handbag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she fool me
She still bad though, and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though
We filling up the gas for Rollies
Upgrade to twenty-sixes after riding Kobes
My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya
He overcompensates for the life of his ancestors
So blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw
The reason why the next four-hundred we gotta floss
Slaves

Uh, I said the four-hundred years we never had nothing
Barely had clothes on our back
It's the reason why when we get a little bit of change
We over-exaggerate on our living expenses
So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
You're a vanity slave
If you're a female and you got four, five, six rings on your finger
Four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing
You're a vanity slave
If you got an '02 Monte Carlo with twenty-fours on it
And on the back of the window it says "Get on my level, hoe."
You're a vanity slave
We're all vanity slaves
And with that being said, can somebody please tell me where the mall at?
I'm not from around here
Hey Ali, where we at? Idaho?
Yeah nigga, you know the first of the month
Let them checks coming nigga
I'm tryna get some, but what up?

// Far From Here //

[Kendrick Lamar:]
A nigga so goddamn stressed out
I feel like fuck everything right now
See I've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life
But I'll be damned if I give 'em my handout
See my pride is one thing I will not put aside
I'm too proud to beg, I'm sorry Left Eye
If I don't make it in life, motherfucker I tried
What? Uh

You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your mamma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like it's only you

So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here

It seems like, you can't win for losing
Whatever you're doing turns out to be "what-are-you-doing?"
Sick of pursuing, that your time will soon come
Nobody knows the position that you in
But it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing
That feeling, hard to explain
When you just, just want to get away
Something like

You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your mamma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like it's only you

So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here

[Schoolboy Q:]
Away from it all
Take me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit
The smartest astronomers, they won't even see my vision
I'm stuck on the studio couch, now thinking 'bout my daughter
Times is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered
Just press record or, seems like I need a mill' to keep my shit in order
Instead of problem solving
From my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride
Set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes
Reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud
Shitting on a bird's head, higher than a dread
As I fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony
Nothingness surrounding me, living my life
Though it's better to write
Configuring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light
So how you feel? My nigga, I keep it real
A Schoolboy soon to be star, Mr. Lamar

[Kendrick Lamar:]
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here

// Thanksgiving //

Reporting live from Compton, California
North Cackalack

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix
You're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting
My itinerary is very hectic
I break records on every record, I'm truly reckless
Kendrick Lamar, no Audemar on my wrist
It's arthritis from holding it down bitch
Me and my down bitch, get busy
I'm busy taking over, the world
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
My drive is not to be chauffeured
I'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
Whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper
To hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
With offers that got me up in these offices often
Boo-yaa, who ya? No one, I've done situated myself, I ain't lying
Be sure to be friend 'cause my foes die five times
The good kid from the mad city
Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock
In a 1992 Cadillac that I got from my pops
Transmission slipping, but I ain't tripping, swallow my pride
Pop in my tape and roll the window, down
Like Stacie homie when airing out endo
I wish a nigga would

A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock

[Rapper Big Pooh:]
Yo, it's evident, I'm evidently your favorite
All I ask, open your ears and please savor it
The taste is un-acquired, quietly, been inspired
I'm at a point in my life when I was getting tired
Now I'm brushing off the dust
We don't need no water, fire burned it to the dust
Nigga grind hard, roaches turning into musk
People hear his pain, I consider that a plus
I'm a grown man, so a few I have trust to Do the Right Thing
The Spike thing, consider me the in-between
The new regime taking over
Either we each other's opposition or you soldier
Used to have the whole state of NC on my shoulder then I passed it
Off to the next, you unlucky bastard
I'm getting drunk same time every year
To celebrate the life, Rosie no longer here
I swear

A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo
Even Zeus can get beat up from punchlines
When I kick it and pump mine, I've got to be a prophet
I've gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
I'm a Hub City representer, so I've got to represent the
City like a District Attorney beatin' the case for killers
Might walk around in gurney, this is my sickest winter
Since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers

[Rapper Big Pooh:]
U-P-S, I deliver
Little brown boy get the pick of the litter
No glitter, all guts, no glory
Station on repeat, they retread the same story
New niggas bore me, tryna progress to that old shit
Have a plate, that food for your soul tip
Drill it in your head, youngun it's that real Hip-
Hop along 'fore you get your little ass whipped

A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock

// Let Me Be Me //

[Kendrick Lamar:]
We on Ali? You ugly

Everybody, just clap your hands if you're real
Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
Be yourself, just show me you're real
Middle fingers up

Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
(That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's-that's the only way I know how to hold it down)

Uh, I just wanna be me
No disrespect, but motherfuck you
My education stopped at a high school degree
But I can outsmart any high IQ
Draped in some fly shit, call me Jeff Goldblum
Cold, my style making my nose run
Oh, I stare at the mirror, then realize
That real lies, within me
Some say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink
Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit
Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
So if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit
And California on that jerk shit
But I'd just rather two-step like my first steps
Jill Scott in my iPod as my head rests, yes

Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
(That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's-that's the only way I know how to hold it down)

And yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali'
But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis
And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
Ha-ha-ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor?
Stale face, play me short like an Oompa-Loompa
You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
Won't you lighten up like Michael did?
I grew up with killers man, people who killed men
But my character never could be like them, man
And they respect that, say that I'm real man
Not a fake person, that's the Sims, man
Live my life through some film, man?
I ain't acting out shit, I be packing out shows
Cause they know they'll know Kendrick for sure, and oh

Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
(That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's-that's the only way I know how to hold it down)

Almost lost my life to the industry
Had to look through a photo book to remember me
These label heads ain't nothing but bullshit
Have you with professional killers, chasing hits
Lying to yourself all over an image
Making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance
My mama said, "Boy, that don't sound like you."
I said, "This is the sound, though." my only excuse
Quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie
And kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me
The reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers ain't me
And you can underrate me, but I know what I'm worth
A diamond in God's dirt, a diamond in winter
Watching Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
See I give you my life to mix it up in a blender
To make sure that you feel it

Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
(That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's-that's the only way I know how to hold it down)

[Female:]
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Is this really you? Is this who you are?
What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Who are you?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I think that I finally reached the pinnacle
Of finding myself as an individual
The world is so typical
I just wanna be higher than that
I used to want to be the messiah of rap
Infatuated with becoming a relevant star
Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
That I never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
Vanity, they say that it can damage me
So do I really want it?
If I didn't, I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect
That means I'll be fronting, hmm
Cooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story
That the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me
Knowing that I'm misunderstood
So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would
And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
Or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
And Dave said he proud of my newfound honesty
And all I could say is "Will the radio care?"
Yeah, or should I say no?
Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach?
You heard my hip-hop when I was sixteen years old
Well that was me then, now I'm an adult
Twenty-two like the smallest of guns that you know, most determined
But with the smallest of funds to show, but I'm not worried
My talent should take me places I've never been
The world should turn soon as my record spin
I wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit
The negative you bring, the stress, the violence
The capital punishment, the loud police sirens
Too focused, one word, righteous
And this is Kendrick Lamar
And soon y'all know Cloud Nine y'all
And that means I wanna be the highest
Too focused, one word (righteous)
Mm, yeah
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focused, one word

[Female:]
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word

// Determined //

[Napoleon Hill:]
"I want to describe my discovery in the simplest terms possible because it will reveal to you why it is true that's whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve regardless of how many times you may have failed in the past or how lofty your aims and hopes may be."

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Go-getter with no cheddar
Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
My life is likely to see great endeavors
But I can't win if I can't get it together
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy Awards best-dressed
With an address linked to a beautiful actress
A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
That don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
But the last time I checked, y'all was broke bitches
Make a name for myself
Then bubble like the ass of Buffy when she wearing a tight belt
The homies on the block can say whatever they say
I don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates

[Ash Riser:]
Take your time, it'll come
Just stay focused and humble my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who's dope, it's who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

[Kendrick Lamar:]
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy Awards best-dressed
With an address next to a beautiful actress
Do I gotta run in your spot and start blasting?
Better yet, rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing
Hear a hustle on a nigga that's constantly bragging
Catch him at the light, snatch him out his Jeep wagon
Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose
Cop five bricks of the yay, head to the Bay
Area, or carry the birds to VA
Let the clips distribute the work all day
Then come back home
Every three weeks, flip three-to-six zones
Homies on the block can say whatever they want
I don't wanna be a dealer, I wanna be a Trump
Donald that is

[Ash Riser:]
Take your time, it'll come
Just stay focused and humble my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who's dope, it's who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

[Kendrick Lamar (over chorus):]
And when I do it, I do it again, then I go back
When I do it, I'll do it again, then I go back
Thug it out, but for now I'm willing to dug it out
I gotta grind, grind

[Kendrick Lamar:]
So welcome to the story of my life
See I'm tryna get right off the shit that I write
Make a fortune, buy some Porsches for my mamma and my wife
Pop's engine in this old school run tight!
But as you listening to K. D-O-T
Me and my girl split the bucket at KFC
She listening to Drake and all I can say
"Damn, these niggas that much better than me
Baby?" I don't think this is meant to be
'Cause I'm always losing self-esteem
She paused the iPhone, then said, "Huh?"
I repeated what I said, then she replied, "Shut up!"
You know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it
But don't forget when you do, just keep you in it
And never listen to what the industry say
Don't be a typical artist, be more like Jay
Russell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones
Bob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid
Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah
So I gotta see success
I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps
Rising to the top like a soda shook up
'Bout to pop, and I'll pop on whoever's in my way

[Ash Riser:]
Take your time, it'll come
Just stay focused and humble my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who's dope, it's who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

[Kendrick Lamar (over chorus):]
Yeah, I swear to God I don't wanna do it, just live man
I wanna live good
Just wanna make my mamma proud, y'know?
I don't wanna be hard, I don't want the most stripes
I got little brothers and sisters man, I'm the oldest nigga
I just want it, I just want it
And I'ma get it

// Today //

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Bumping some Sade rolling my window down and hitting the highway
No it's not Friday, but it's my day and sometimes shit gotta go my way
Niggas got me fucked up thinking that my music don't stick like some nunchucks
Top Dawg and we All Stars like we run Chucks, but never mind that
Take a trip to outer space show you where my mind at
You know where my grind at
Inside of the studio is where I spend my time at
Fuck over the game 'til I make that bitch climax
Miss me with that bullshit, haters die young you can run to the pulpit
Pulling off the pit stop, card like a flip flop
Bitches clap at me like they wanna make my piss hot

I don't even trip though I don't need no company
Me, I'm thinking long-term tryin' build a company
Kendrick the Good Kid

[JaVonté:]
As I move, I feel way better doing me
I can only do me
I hope that, you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that I'm rude
But I don't give a damn
If she, if he, if them or they say I'm uncool
Nothing will change now I feel me today

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Nigga what I compose be so potent
That if the Earth dried I could spit back the ocean
Then hop on the jet ski and start Westcoastin'

I'm not boasting or bragging
Not a person, I'm a dragon
Taking action in the heat of the night
So if the devil came, tell him that I'll be alright
I'm so high off life that I can OD
Walk outside then sniff a whole key

Oh lady don't call the police
it's just the average Joe walking with his heart on his appendix
Don't be afraid to speak

So to speak, you niggas not within arm-reach
Y'all midget macks swingin' on Shaq now have a seat
You can never co-exist with my mamma's oldest
Kendrick be thy name I got my mind right

My nigga locked in the pen that's why my mind write
Ink over my brain, wha's up?!

[JaVonté:]
As I move, I feel way better doing me
I can only do me
I hope that, you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that I'm rude
But I don't give a damn
If she, if he, if them or they say I'm uncool
Nothing will change now I feel me today

[Kendrick Lamar:]
So let me start off the third verse
Pickin' off your favorites since I'm cursed
Fuck the system, fuck the truth, fuck religion
Fuck the government, fuck the law, fuck the prisons
Fuck George Bush, fuck rappers who love dissing
Fuck you because you don't see my vision

I fucked your new girlfriend too because she's cute
And the ass look like a grenade within the denim
Fuck the groupies, fuck the gossipin' bitches
Fuck niggas who can't fight so pull triggers
Fuck the new world gas price that costs a living
Fuck your love, fuck your hate, fuck your snitching
And whether you fuck with me or not
I don't give a fuck you could keep your props
Fuck keeping it real, I'mma keep it K-Dot
Kendrick everyday, JAY-Z didn't lie
Fucker!

[JaVonté:]
As I move, I feel way better doing me
I can only do me
I hope that, you do you
I think to myself truthfully, I can only feel me
Some people say that I'm rude
But I don't give a damn
If she, if he, if them or they say I'm uncool
Nothing will change now I feel me today

// Vanity Slaves Pt. 2 //

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I swear you people don't know Kendrick, you don't know him
But you say you want some more Kendrick, I'm 'bout to show 'em
Everything inside this human being, I'm still growing
I'm a premature baby in this crazy life that we adore
Doors on the Lamborghini, I want 'em
Can't afford 'em so I tell the swap meet to clone 'em
I guess I really am a vanity slave
I guess my ancestors turning in their graves
Burning money when I get it, fuck a life savings
Overdraft bank statements, just to make a statement
When I put this fashion on, I'm a fashion junkie
Picking cotton in the country, I bought this out the country
Whips and chains, whips and chains, Jacob know my name
He call me Kunta, you my brother, we come from the same modern world
That's ya girl? I see she rocking Fendi
Try this on
If it ain't upscale then you may offend me
Copping everything in sight, ignoring their sacrifice
Amnesia if I see the black visa in my hand tonight
I show my dick and then I swipe, that's a punchline
They was hot and I wore ice, that's ironic huh?

[Kendrick Lamar & Gucci Mane:]
Word around town that I'm all about the bitches
Word around town that I love my 26s
Word around town that I gotta stay paid
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
It's the Gucci cock and shoot
Found my swag but lost my roof, (Burr! Burr!)
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave
See my Audemar tick, as my Audemar tock
Lord please forgive me I'm a vanity slave

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Aw man videos got me wanting hoes
Appetite for flashing lights, all I can do is pose
A black male... on Melrose. I should get blackmailed
By my people hell rose, niggas that ain't had shit
For 400 years overcompensate by over accessorizing with gear
Man y'all don't see my vision
I do it for the love of hip hop and the love of bitches
Am I a hypocrite 'cause everyday I'm contradicting
I think of how I'm living, then I watch "How I'm Living" I know this can't be right
My conscience tell me to stay righteous
It's unlikely to see what I like and say I don't like it
Biggest dilemma my priorities ignoring me, I wanna move accordingly
But baby steps are premature remember?
I'm flying to the south and I'll be gone 'til November
To see my family tree but this a shame I'm yelling, out, timber

[Kendrick Lamar & Gucci Mane:]

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Cold, oh so cold
How ironic he bought it then sold his soul
Is it masonic for your vice to take its toll?
The remote control is taking control
Lift up the doors
That Lamborghini I wanted come with a dumb ass model that in vogue
I like 'em both, I'll wife 'em both
Take these motherfucking Jordan's off, put on my loafs
'Cause nothing goes bad, every time I wear (Gucci)
I'm getting more ass, every time I wear (Gucci)
They told me it's a fad, every time I wear (Gucci)
But should I give a fuck when it bring me more coochie?
This a young nigga's pedigree, I pray the lord can better me
If not he 'bout to strike me down like this my third felony
The voices keep on telling me, Kendrick don't forget about us
I burned my wardrobe, hoping that I could live without it
