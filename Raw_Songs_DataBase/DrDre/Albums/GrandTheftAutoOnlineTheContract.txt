// Fallin Up //

[Intro:]
(Eyes, only, we gon' see)
(These, eyes, only, we gon' see)

[The Game:]
Yeah, what goes up originally comes down
Let the dollars levitate as the world goes round from the ground Keep fallin' up (Keep fallin' up)
Keep fallin' up (Keep fallin' up)
As I fall up on this sentence so hot (Envy)
Can't feel it unless I put my hand on it like the killer did my money
Keep fallin' up (Keep fallin' up)
Keep fallin' up (Keep fallin' up)

[Dr. Dre:]
Now that I got my shit together, better than ever
These motherfuckers habitualize like steppers
Make a nigga wanna write a Dear John letter
Hm, make her disappear, had to get the Penn and Teller
A best seller, interstellar, good fella
This a long kiss goodnight, ciao, bella
My Airforce Ones steppin' on that Air Force One
Leavin' fuckin' footprints on the sun
Thirty-six shots and I only just begun
One man band soundin' like a hundred drums
Make that ass clap back, rum-pum-pum-pum
Give it to me raw, that shimmy-shimmy, all that
Brand new Ford Mach, this is what you call that
You don't see that caution tape? Nigga better fall back (Heh)
I got Hov on the line, I gotta call back
Life's a bitch, and I'm takin' off the ball strap

[Cocoa Sarai:]
Well, they don't make real niggas like (These)
Gone with it, bitch, you could see it in my (Eyes)
Post somethin' for them real motherfuckers (Only)
Oh, you a boss in this motherfucker? (We gon' see)
No, they don't make 'em like (Me)
Envy is a motherfucker, see it in they (Eyes)
Private invitation, this is members (Only)
Fuck what you thought, niggas love to talk (We gon' see)

[The Game:]
Yeah, what goes up originally comes down
Let the dollars levitate as the world goes round from the ground Keep fallin' up (Keep fallin' up)
Keep fallin' up (Keep fallin' up)
As I fall up on this sentence so hot (Envy)
Can't feel it unless I put my hand on it like the killer did my money
Keep fallin' up (Keep fallin' up)
Keep fallin' up (Keep fallin' up)

[Dr. Dre:]
I hit you with no delayin', so what you sayin', yo?
Last nigga that tried to play me was on the radio
Hear we go, light up my career, built off dope
Got everybody rollin' The Chronic, tryin' to smoke
Okay, fuck it, get high
Trendset, deny
Niggas swear they could compete, shit, I just sit by
Put a bunch of motherfucking Crips on the red-eye
Pay to get that ass removed, now that's a goodbye
Allow me to reintroduce myself
It's that same nigga from the bomb city, who else?
Hah, live at the barbecue, genuine article
I'm fuckin' diabolical, you better call a audible
I swarm with the killer bees, yeah, it's time to bring that pain
Shame on the nigga playin' old dirty games
Shoutout to Long Beach, they goin' insane
Dollar signs is the set I claim

[Cocoa Sarai:]
Well, they don't make real niggas like (These)
Gone with it, bitch, you could see it in my (Eyes)
Post somethin' for them real motherfuckers (Only)
Oh, you a boss in this motherfucker? (We gon' see)
No, they don't make 'em like (Me)
Envy is a motherfucker, see it in they (Eyes)

Fuck what you thought, niggas love to talk (We gon' see)

[Outro:]
These, eyes, only, we gon' see

// Gospel //

Yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
What? (Uh) What? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dre, you ready? (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
C'mon (Yo, we gotta do whatever...)
Alright (Check, check, check, check, check)
Get 'em!

Cut 'em undercover, timeless, ready for 'em, progress
Feelin' like I'm just gettin' started
Two shots back for my dearly departed
Uh, you are now dealin' with a monster, boss shit, profits
Doc Dre, bitch, I'm a prophet
Black Wall Street, niggas know where the stock is
Heh, try me, niggas never see me, but it ain't hard to find me
Heh, unwinding, shit's blinding, still grinding, up rising
Agh, stop talking 'bout the past, I'm the future, nigga
Agh, nigga like me still here, motherfucker, go figure
Lookin' for my next gold digger
This summer here gon' be colder than winter
Already told you, I fold you like hundreds of billions
And you can go missing, put that on my children
Bet that, nigga, what? Regret that, run it up
Heh, and I'm about to sum it up
This shit here that problem, livin' at the bottom of a bottle
"Full throttle" my motto, ehh
Fuckin' with me like fuckin' with the lotto
That awful in your nostril, in a brothel, this is gospel
Yeah, I'ma need all that pronto

Yes I, yes I, yes I, ride 'til I die
Give a fuck if you bitches die
Put a motherfucking hole in your face
Back up, bitch, don't even try
I am that motherfucker, been the coldest
Why you on that, no one know us
Overdosed on what dope is (Yeah)
Hip-hop shit sell better than the coke did

Like a satanic cult
It's an old ritual slaughtering GOATS, bitch (GOATS, bitch, yeah)
You're fucking with the original, flow's sick
And anybody can get it: COVID (Fuck with that?)
I done wrote shit that was so sharp
I could slit my own fucking throat with it
So rich, I got more chips than my shoulders
And I'm about as approachable as a roach is (Roach is, yeah)
So better steer clear from him
Here comes a nuclear bomb for your eardrums
Lyricism at its most fearsome and fierce
We're on another tier like a tear duct's upper echelon (Yeah)
Your career sucks (Meaning what?), it was sheer luck (Like what?)
Like a fuckin' leprechaun with its beard cut
(Still a) Punisher, weapon drawn with a beer gut (Haha)
You're slower than a Decepticon with its gear stuck
(And I what?) I serial kill, and you're Kellogg's
I love checks and I hate tricks
And you're a fake bitch (Bitch)
I could spot you like you 'bout to weight lift (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm badder than cake mix
(But I) Can't be whipped with egg beaters (Nah)
You cunts must be out of your labias, and God is my alias
So if I don't have faith in me, then it basically makes me an atheist
(Woo) Nate Diaz got the world by the tracheas in a chokehold and a sleeper *snores*
Yeah, and me and Dre are like dog hair (Woof)
We're both in our lab coats like retrievers
But like a Doberman, I'm a whole different breed of (What?)
Animal mutt mixed with a overachiever (Yeah)
Oh, you're the king of rap? You 'bout to be overthrown
Like a pass over the head of an open receiver
This shit could end up comin' to blows like a wiener (Haha)
But I ain't finished puttin' these hoes through the ringer (Nah)
Like clothes in between the two roll is aâ€“ wait, no
What I'm in is flow's interwoven, I treat 'em like thread (Why?)
That's how I wound up sewin' machine up
So, fucks if you don't give up me the time to ride or die (Yeah)
'Cause you're either both or you're neither (Yeah)
Throw a middle finger up (Yeah) if you're rollin' (Yeah)
But, me, I'm gonna

Ride 'til I die
Give a fuck if you bitches die
Put a motherfucking hole in your face
Back up bitch, don't even try
I am that motherfucker, been the coldest
Why you on that, no one know us
Overdosed on what dope is
Hip-Hop shit sell better than the coke did

// Black Privilege //

I'm just standin' here, lookin' at the man in the mirror
You good? Ahah, nigga, I'm great
Ayy, nigga, talk your shit, Doc Dre

Yeah, I see the way the game played
Nigga like me put the hood on that walk of fame
Fingerprints of Eazy-E still stain the brain
Gang-bang relationships, no need to name names
Black Mamba mentality, shit, it's time to ball (Yeah)
All my niggas on the yacht with me amistad (Yeah)
Custom made hip-hop, nigga, watch the roof, cuh
It's a hard pill to swallow, baby, Juice WRLD (Big shot)
Big shot, big shot, now who the killer?
Sendin' pirates to your block, boy, Captain Phillips (Brrat)
Got L.A on my back, boy, it takes a village
We deserve to be on top, boy, black privilege (Uh)
Central Bay fuck up the whole day
Ice Cube sittin' by the Doc, O'Shea (Heheh)
C-notes under the couch with the old face
Shit, I'm headin' to Puffy's house, a million dollars a plate (Blah)
Comin' in, Airforce, Uncle Sam
Quit worryin' about the other man
Pay taxes in rubber bands
Last night, in a chess game
Nigga walked away with a hundred grand
Pussy poppin', billin' shit, killin' shit, Son of Sam
Multi-billion dollar check on you fuckboys
Livin' life, it's your price, I got enough toys
My legacy is undefeated, call that bitch Floyd
I gave my blood to this shit, you welcome, enjoy
Gang money, J money
Yeah, we got plate money
I don't know what's on the way for me
Give a fuck, I stay hungry
No better feelin' in the world than that-
Brinks truck when it's pullin' in
Hit the box like clockwork, y'all talk work, we put it in
What the fuck? (Woo)
I like it like that, baby workin' that back
(Woo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
She don't know how to act (Yeah)
Say somethin', say somethin'
Shake somethin', shake somethin'
Haha, excuse me while I kiss the sky
I just called a lick, watch me shake somethin' (Shake somethin')
You a thick bitch, better shake somethin' (Shake somethin')
Let's get rich, time to break somethin' (Shake somethin')
Shake somethin' (Shake somethin')
Shake somethin' (Woo)
I'm movin' like a big fish, watch me bake somethin'
Titanic drip, nigga, say somethin'
Fuck them politics and all that fake stuntin'
Shake somethin' (Shake somethin')
Shake somethin' (Shake somethin')
C'mon (Woo)
I like it like that, baby workin' that back
(Woo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
She don't know how to act (Yeah)
Back with that rat-tat-tat-tat
That dressed in all black
That stepped the fuck back shit (Move)
That grown man shit, it's workin'
That's a bad bitch, that's perfect
That shit right there is worth it
That's my sedative (Yeah)
That's my sedative (Yeah)

H-H-Hol' up, (Hahaha) fuckin' men you are to run this shit back right now, nigga
Right the fuck-, run it back DJ, that's selecta
Run the bloodclat chune

// Diamond Mind //

Yeah, turn all of our headphones up
Eh, turn that shit up a lil' bit more
Lil' bit more, lil' bit more, lil' bit more, lil' bit more
That's good right there

Uh, we live this Marathon life
'Cause one day we gon' all die
Not a stranger to them hard nights
But when we look up, we see our sky
We see potential in the moment
We used to have to rent, now we own it
No hesitation, we be on it
We get paid to spend these midnights in Paris like we Owen
Wilson, what a feelin', live in it 'cause you built it
Ballin', Spalding, shot it, killed it
This Rollie is the symbol that represent my resilience
The Marathon's my leverage, negotiations was brilliance
Put my feet up on the desk, never
We just re-up to the next level
VVS the nothin' less bezel
I got the ho you lost in four on the sex schedule
I'm busy grindin', baby, nine-to-nine
So she just happy when I find the time
She got a fetish for designer styles
I'm lookin' like I robbed a diamond mine

This crazy life of mine
No happy endings to this life of crime
So this little light of mine
Nigga, I'ma let it shine
Esta vida loca, mija
Esta vida loca, mija (Esta vida loca)
Esta vida loca, mija (Esta vida loca, mija)
Esta vida loca, mija

This crazy life of mine
Can make a grown man cry sometimes
Lookin' up at the sky at night
Prayin' for better days, better times
This crazy life of mine
I've been tryna keep my spirit alive
Smokin' 'za, I'm hopin' that it gets me high
Prayin' for better days, better days

Listen, Doc Dre, you know I don't show up often
Uh, but when I do, I put shit in motion
Motion picture shit, nigga, picture me rollin'
A composer with composure, bitch, I'm Compton's Beethoven
Silhouettes and naked bodies layin' in the sand
Now that's California love, you know who the fuck I am
Still hood, still good, Chucks on my butlers
Soundtrack in every neighborhood and causin' all this ruckus
Mm, Compton bully in this motherfucker (Heh)
Same nigga, same hoodie in this motherfucker
Back in business, oh yeah, this is mass production
So tired of niggas talkin' when they just ballin' on the budget
Still feel like a strugglin' artist and better believe I still love it
Look at my life, shit, I did something right, easy does it (Heh)
I'm just in here jugglin' time
But, for the moment, I'm on it, nigga, tryna get mine
You know the motherfuckin' mountains I climb

This crazy life of mine
No happy endings to this life of crime
So this little light of mine
Nigga, I'ma let it shine
Esta vida loca, mija
Esta vida loca, mija (Esta vida loca)
Esta vida loca, mija (Esta vida loca, mija)
Esta vida loca, mija

This crazy life of mine
Can make a grown man cry sometimes
Lookin' up at the sky at night
Prayin' for better days, better times
This crazy life of mine
I've been tryin' to keep my spirit alive
Smokin' 'za, I'm hopin' that it gets me high
Prayin' for better days, better times

I'm purifyin' my soul
I'm settin' my intentions and I conquer my goals
It's been a long journey, had to hop on the road
It's been a long journey, had to get up and go
It's been a few years since my nigga been gon'
Blew some in the air for my nigga to smoke
I was your dawg, you was my loc, then you turned to the G.O.A.T
"The Marathon Continues" written in bold

// ETA //

I think my shit kickin' in
Must be barbeque or somethin'
What's the ETA of the month? (Hahahaha)
On life, nigga, on life
Alright, c'mon, let's get serious

Yeah, been around, versatile, South of France, Rosecrans
Pin 'em up, knock 'em down, baby, I don't hold hands (Woah)
Big booty, little dog, joggin' by Kenneth Hahn
Tryna get her fitness on, bitch, just hop in the car
Uh, I been around, marathon, Compton to Avalon
Me and Anderson, this is like Royal Tenenbaums
No one goes to cinemas, so we on demand
They want a hologram, it's TikTok and dances
Big shot, been the bomb, make me reminisce upon
I remember me and Dogg, swap meet, Dickies on
When was that? In '93? You probably wasn't even born
Dre, I think you need to the trade Range for the 6-4
Shit, I've been going back and forth, Chevy or Aventador
Took a walk in the park, nigga, that's your backyard
Say, Dre, where you get them shrooms with the chocolate?
Shit, the same place that I saw them gods out in Panama

Weave through the weeds, smoke trees where my seeds grow
Let 'em try to press, get shot like a free throw
Aw, niggas want beef 'til they get they fucking teeth broke
I just want peace, they don't want me to be peaceful
You know I'm a king, look at how my Cuban link glow
Gold medallion flow, only second to the Nile
Girls gone wild like them broads up in college
Looking at my child do the same thing that I did

Nigga, where was you in the '80s?
Reaganomics, we sold crack to mothers and they babies
Fiends was running 'round with stolen shit to sell me crazy
But I took some shorts and a couple nicks of crack and gave 'em maybe
Gave this bitch a sample, that's my test tube baby
Tell them fiends we back in town, ice cream pastries
Five-star general bitch, I'm outrankin' 'em
Fiends gave me so much bread, I had to start thankin' 'em
Side hustlers stole some of my dope, I started spankin' 'em
Talked to coke connects in Jamaican accent, Shabba Rankin 'em
If you stole my shit with the nigga that helped you, walk the plank with him
Hmm, bruk him though like a bumbaclot acronym
Shh, look, don't tell your peeps but all of my niggas are after him
Hmm, you're just a bitch, tell me, why you actin' so masculine?
Hmm, who the fuck is he? Tell me, why the fuck is you asking him? (Why?)
And as I'm smoking this branch, watch me pass the limb
I'm only here to collect my blessings, where the pastor been?

Weave through the weeds, smoke trees where my seeds grow
Let 'em try to press, get shot like a free throw
Aw, niggas want beef 'til they get they fucking teeth broke
I just want peace, they don't want me to be peaceful
You know I'm a king, look at how my Cuban link glow
Gold medallion flow, only second to the Nile
Girls gone wild like them broads up in college
Looking at my child do the same thing that I did

// The Scenic Route //

Biggest, the untouchable (Huh)
D-R-E (What's up my nigga? Business is boomin')
Rozay! (Yeah, what?)
Welcome to the playground for the bosses
If you ever counted us out, bitch, you couldn't count
Motherfuckin' absurd amounts
The unthinkable (Go 'head, speak the truth)

I'm makin' pussy niggas push the panic button (Boss)
I'm watchin' all these niggas runnin' out of money
Waterfalls, foreign cars and Italian luggage
Just showing off my war scars and they all love it
I want it all, marble walls and my dogs runnin'
Southside of Compton and did it all from nothin' (Huh)
Above the law, I get a call and we all comin' (Trick)
Once they know I push the button, niggas start runnin' (Bang)
Fuck 'em all, livin' large and we all gunners
I'm still in charge, temper's short with the tall numbers
Expensive calls, still extortin' all the frauds comin'
I could buy the Dodgers with my credit card money

It's a fantasy for niggas on the other side (I say)
I'll be damned if I don't put my family first in line (Family)
Such a tragedy, what happened to them other guys (I pray)
Don't be mad at me, it's just the way the shit designed (Someway)
It's a fantasy for niggas on the other side (I say)
I'll be damned if I don't put my family first in line (Family)
Such a tragedy, what happened to them other guys (I pray)
Don't be mad at me, it's just the way the shit designed (Sing it)

Fantasies for niggas that done fantasized (Fuck 'em)
I got you niggas dancin' like it's Hammer Time (Yes)
In them funny pants, I had a gun in mine (Chea)
LeBron James numbers, go 'head, analyze 'em
Will Smith bitches in the summertime (Woop, woop)
It's still Cali love until they gun me down (Blaow)
I did a verse, he gave your boy a hundred pounds (Woo)
Rozay and Doc Dre, now how the fuck that sound?
They love the candy paint, they wanna see it bounce (Yes)
Ayy, my nigga, I might let down the top and take the scenic route (Yes)
I just wanna mob and maybe stain the house
Bitch, it's Doc Dre, Impalas, bring 'em out (Huh)

It's a fantasy for niggas on the other side (I say)
I'll be damned if I don't put my family first in line (Family)
Such a tragedy, what happened to them other guys (I pray)
Don't be mad at me, it's just the way the shit designed (Someway)
It's a fantasy for niggas on the other side (I say)
I'll be damned if I don't put my family first in line (Family)
Such a tragedy, what happened to them other guys (I pray)
Don't be mad at me, it's just the way the shit designed (Sing it)
