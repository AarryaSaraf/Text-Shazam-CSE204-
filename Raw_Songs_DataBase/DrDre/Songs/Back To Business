They've been wondering if I'm gon' show
Shit, you already know-ow-ow-ow
Where you been? Where you at? Where you headed?
This shit started to disappear, oh no-o-o-o
I'm right here, yeah
Shit, right back to the basics
Sound like I'm right back in the basement
Tryna put my neighborhood on
Six in the morning (Yeah, six in the morning)
Until six in the morning (Best believe I'm on it)
Man I'm working so hard
When the check hit the bank, shit, I ain't even notice
I live in the future
I'm blind to the moment
I, I, you ain't gotta say
Oh you ain't gotta lay around, we own it

And I remember when I was young, just a front runner
I was fucking with them drums like every summer
Homies couldn't make it out the hood, make a nigga wonder
But I couldn't let Compton take a nigga under
No way, no how, can't stop
Had, bigger dreams for this hip-hop
I'm happy, it was music and not Ziplocs
And now we, bringing crowds like it's Woodstock
I might as well wipe down the crown I done put up in the attic
I don't play around, lotta niggas coming through the door
Not too many stay around
Lot of artists made it, yeah, god damn man I made a sound
Oh you ain't never seen a legend do it? Hold up, homie wait around
I've been on the verge since a nigga put it down
And if we talking numbers, fuck Billboard charts
So they can start with the bank accounts

I've been away
But I see y'all still ain't catch us
Anything you do can't impress us
I won't let up on it
They gonna say
Anything because they hate us
And the fact that they can't break us
I will never let up
I'm going, yeah I'm going
(I'm going, better believe I'm going) Oh
(I'm going) Oh
It's time to get back to business

This shit realer than rap
Somewhere trapped where you can find me at
Got thirteen in my strap
And I keep this bitch with me whatever town we at
I'm killing these niggas, was never feeling these niggas
Went from a million to ten figures I gross
Getting back to the business and in the back of a Bentley
I'm thinking, "Damn how far can I go?"
Well, if my nigga Dre can get a bill
That let me know that it's hope for a nigga still
And many more showing love for my art form
When the ATL, the trap shit is on board, hold up (Bankhead!)
Think they gave the wrong nigga money when they let me in
If it wasn't meant for me, they shouldn't have let me sit
The explanation for all the devilish shit we did
I'm grinding, handling my business nigga

So many miles in the air
Pardon me, I'm standing on my paper
Up, up and away-er
One way ticket to the ozone layer
Don't you wanna roll where there ain't no mid around?
Take you to another atmosphere, smoke this
Smoke this (Roll it up, roll it up, get a lighter)
Smoke this (Roll it up, roll it up, get a lighter)
I can change your atmosphere
I can change your atmosphere
Get your girl to feel my Johnson (Roll it up)
Smoke this (Break it down, roll it up, get a lighter)
Smoke this (Roll it up, get a lighter)
I can change your atmosphere, atmosphere
Smoke this
