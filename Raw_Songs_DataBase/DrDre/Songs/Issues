From close range we official
Cocaine, money and pistols
Goddammit I got issues
Can't be serious
(Alright now here we go)
Where my city at?
Fuck with me, come on
I know you're feeling that
Fuck with me, come on
You know I'm really that
Fuck with me, come on
Come on, come on
Don't even act like I ain't 'bout my business
Motherfucker come on!
Come on, come on
Full clip, ammunition
You don't wanna deal with these fucking consequences

Fuck boys should tighten up a whole lot
I got some niggas with me down for running up in your spot
And these niggas got hatchets and ratchets
Some of them lethals up under the mattress
And matter of fact this is a chance to show my lifestyle out to the masses
But chances are I might get another negative reaction
Think I'm a fraction, but I fucks 'em up like battery acid
I gives a fuck what you think, nigga? This is my passion
Survive through the time, you know my name, you know my reputation
You know what it is, I don't need to give no explanation
When you say my fucking name, add exclamation
Los Angeles king now, make your bitch bring crowns
To me and Dre, you don't like it, you can lay
Think I'm quiet cause I'm acting, but my bank account gon' say "Fuck you!"
Respected from SoCal out to the Bay
Cashed a lot of checks this morning, guess today was a good day

Now I lay me down
And wake up to gunshots in this crazy town
Good morning
And the sleepers will join the fallen

But this is what the fuck is up, doing this for my city
Comp-town, Hub, this my fucking committee
Shout out to Dub C, real nigga be with me
C-Walking on these niggas with a crease in them Dickies
You know how many nights I heard them sparks echo in the park?
Around this time I was spinning records at Eve After Dark
My city crazy, school girls used to play with that chalk
Same chalk police used to outline niggas we lost
You understand what I'm saying? Shit is crazy, man
Fuck the money, yo this shit could never change me, man
These new niggas in this bitch could never phase me, man
I know it's strange but on some real shit it's plain as day
I'm just having some fucking fun with this rap shit
Nigga with an attitude, still getting active
Man this industry to me, it feels a little plastic
I ain't heard nothing that I can consider classic, ugh
But this is for my niggas who been running with me
And everybody in this bitch that's out there gunning for me
And I got love for my people that stay one hundred with me
I'ma keep it A1, been that way since day one

Now I lay me down
And wake up to gunshots in this crazy town
Good morning
And the sleepers'll join the fallen
(And the sleepers'll join the fallen)
So I lay me down
And wake up to gunshots in this crazy town
Good morning
(And the sleepers will join the fallen)

Drama make the city happy
All I think about is making classics
Tragic classics for the masses
This how you make a motherfucking classic (Classic)

This is where I leave you
Carry you
In the city of Compton
This is where I leave you
Carry you
Down the Pacific Coast
This is where I leave you
And all your issues
