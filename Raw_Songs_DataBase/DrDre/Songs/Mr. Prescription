Take a little bit of Hennessey, and mix it with some syrup
Put ya hands up if you crazy enough to get fucked up in church
(Doctor you got my prescription and it's keeping me alive)
(Doctor you got my prescription and it's keeping me alive)

Thank you for being patient, I got ya application
I know you been waiting to see the Doctor!
Here it is, here I am, here it is, here I am
Yes, yo push is right back up in the scene
Yes, my dope is so methamphetamine
Yes, it's coke I've laced inside every beat
Shit, I'm tryna get ya high
You been sitting in the waiting room far too long
Too late for AA, you're far too gone
I know you can't take these awful songs
Like a punk full of bullshit, nigga hell nah
They want some real shit (Right now!)
They want the real (Right now!) relax, I got you
Good thing I had a couple hundred tums laying around
Nigga dispensaries, serving by the pound
Back in business, bigger than we ever was
It's Aftermath nigga, you know you heard of us
We're leaving narcotics on every note
We just strutting the streets, like when the Levee broke
I got the antidote
I got ya hands going up and down, you done fucked up now
But it's hard to go back to that bullshit
And whatever's on the bar, D.R. is gonna push it

You can be my patient (I'm operating) all night
You can be my patient (Man I'm tryna fuck) all night

I beat that boom boom, down like your knees are
Legs spread out, like I'm mixed in a rebirth
Sex contest? There ain't no competitor
Looks like it's too late to get ya girl
Now, cause now what? Now she's my girl
Now you ain't gotta go round no more
For sure! The doctor's operating on the flow

Doctor you got my prescription and it's keeping me alive
Doctor you got my prescription and it's keeping me alive
