Yeah, turn all of our headphones up
Eh, turn that shit up a lil' bit more
Lil' bit more, lil' bit more, lil' bit more, lil' bit more
That's good right there

Uh, we live this Marathon life
'Cause one day we gon' all die
Not a stranger to them hard nights
But when we look up, we see our sky
We see potential in the moment
We used to have to rent, now we own it
No hesitation, we be on it
We get paid to spend these midnights in Paris like we Owen
Wilson, what a feelin', live in it 'cause you built it
Ballin', Spalding, shot it, killed it
This Rollie is the symbol that represent my resilience
The Marathon's my leverage, negotiations was brilliance
Put my feet up on the desk, never
We just re-up to the next level
VVS the nothin' less bezel
I got the ho you lost in four on the sex schedule
I'm busy grindin', baby, nine-to-nine
So she just happy when I find the time
She got a fetish for designer styles
I'm lookin' like I robbed a diamond mine

This crazy life of mine
No happy endings to this life of crime
So this little light of mine
Nigga, I'ma let it shine
Esta vida loca, mija
Esta vida loca, mija (Esta vida loca)
Esta vida loca, mija (Esta vida loca, mija)
Esta vida loca, mija

This crazy life of mine
Can make a grown man cry sometimes
Lookin' up at the sky at night
Prayin' for better days, better times
This crazy life of mine
I've been tryna keep my spirit alive
Smokin' 'za, I'm hopin' that it gets me high
Prayin' for better days, better days

Listen, Doc Dre, you know I don't show up often
Uh, but when I do, I put shit in motion
Motion picture shit, nigga, picture me rollin'
A composer with composure, bitch, I'm Compton's Beethoven
Silhouettes and naked bodies layin' in the sand
Now that's California love, you know who the fuck I am
Still hood, still good, Chucks on my butlers
Soundtrack in every neighborhood and causin' all this ruckus
Mm, Compton bully in this motherfucker (Heh)
Same nigga, same hoodie in this motherfucker
Back in business, oh yeah, this is mass production
So tired of niggas talkin' when they just ballin' on the budget
Still feel like a strugglin' artist and better believe I still love it
Look at my life, shit, I did something right, easy does it (Heh)
I'm just in here jugglin' time
But, for the moment, I'm on it, nigga, tryna get mine
You know the motherfuckin' mountains I climb

This crazy life of mine
No happy endings to this life of crime
So this little light of mine
Nigga, I'ma let it shine
Esta vida loca, mija
Esta vida loca, mija (Esta vida loca)
Esta vida loca, mija (Esta vida loca, mija)
Esta vida loca, mija

This crazy life of mine
Can make a grown man cry sometimes
Lookin' up at the sky at night
Prayin' for better days, better times
This crazy life of mine
I've been tryin' to keep my spirit alive
Smokin' 'za, I'm hopin' that it gets me high
Prayin' for better days, better times

I'm purifyin' my soul
I'm settin' my intentions and I conquer my goals
It's been a long journey, had to hop on the road
It's been a long journey, had to get up and go
It's been a few years since my nigga been gon'
Blew some in the air for my nigga to smoke
I was your dawg, you was my loc, then you turned to the G.O.A.T
