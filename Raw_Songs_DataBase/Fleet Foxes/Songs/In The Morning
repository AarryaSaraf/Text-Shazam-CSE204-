In the morning, when the moon is at its rest
You will find me at the time I love the best
Watching rainbows play on sunlight
Pools of water iced from cold night
In the morning, it's the morning of my life

And in the daytime, I will meet you as before
You will find me waiting by, waiting by the ocean floor
Painting castles in the shifting sands
Pools of water, nobody understands
In the morning, it's the morning of my life

It's the morning of my life
The minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day

In the evening I will fly you to the moon
To the top right-hand corner of the ceiling in my room
Where we'll wait until sunlight
Pools of water iced from cold night
For another day, it's the morning of my life

In the morning, when the moon is at its rest
You will find me at the time I love the best
Watching rainbows play on sunlight
Pools of water iced from cold night
For another day, it's the morning of my life
Yeah, it's the morning of my life
