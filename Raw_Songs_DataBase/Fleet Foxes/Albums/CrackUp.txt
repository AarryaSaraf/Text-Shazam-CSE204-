// I Am All That I Need / Arroyo Seco / Thumbprint Scar //

[Sixth floor, alone]

I am all that I need
And I'll be till I'm through
And I'm light on my feet
Good to be without you
(Distant light, distant dancer)
Mute at Midnight she might Look Like the answer
But I'm all that I nee-

[The band kicks the loner off the stage]

[Into the city]

So, it's true I've gone too far to find you
And the thumbprint scar I let define you
Was a myth I made you measure up to
It was all just water, winding by you
And the basking / gnashing, foaling / feeding
And the rising / falling, melting / freezing
And the raising for destroying feeling
(All we do, this repeats)
(You've got all you need on me)
And now I see that it's all corroding
Soonest seething, soonest folding
But the night won't last if you just hold fast, so calm down
(I am hardly made of steel)
Tell me, are you so concealed?
(Can't I just go to sleep?)
You're no more so blind to me

[Exit out of the city]

[Now memory]

"Are you alone?
I don't believe you
Are you at home? I'll come right now
I need to see you"
Thin as a shim and Scottish pale
Bright white light like a bridal veil
"I don't need you" [Cut to chewn through fingernails]

[Out of memory]

I was a child in the ivy then
I never knew you, you knew me
Not like you knew me
Off on the other ocean now
All is behind you, all is sea

[Back into the city]

[At the edge of the ocean]

[*White Winter Hymnal Sample*]
[*Sound of running up stairs*]

// Cassius, – //

[Under the water]
[Rain]

Past my window, out in the street
Life makes short work of all I see
Men take the change from beggars
Tight bound in sheets
Red and blue, the useless sirens scream

Song of masses, passing outside
All inciting the fifth of July
When guns for hire open fire
Blind against the dawn
When the knights in iron took the pawn
You and I, out into the night
Held within the line that they have drawn

[Above the surface]

As I went they're all beside us in silence
As if unaffected amid the violence
Ooh, are we also tamed?
I was in a river, as if in water
Wife, a son, a son, a son and a daughter
Ooh, are we also tamed?

[Under the water again]

I walked home, no words to say
Cassius, one month gone on his way
And who will lead us
And who remains to die?
By a thread, drop my head to cry

[Above the surface]

As I went they're all beside us in silence
As if unaffected amid the violence
Ooh, are we also tamed?
I was in a river, as if in water
Wife, a son, a son, a son and a daughter
Ooh, are we also tamed?

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

[At sea, in a storm]

// – Naiads, Cassadies //

[The storm suddenly breaks]
[In a car, on the coast]

Who stole the life from you?
Who turned you so against you?
Who was the thief, who shaved your teeth
Accepting just virtue?
Ooh

And did he act alone?
Were any more complicit?
When he would sing, and offer the ring
What older voice said, "kiss it"?

Who?

Who?
Who?
Who?

Fire can't doubt its heat
Water can't doubt its power
You're not adrift
You're not a gift
You know you're not a flower

// Kept Woman //

[At night]

Anna, you're lost in a shadow there
Cinder and smoke hanging in the air
Oh and I know you'll be
Bolder than me, I was high, I was unaware

God above saw, ever in my mind
Blue and white irises in a line
Under your nameless shame
I left you in frame, and you rose to be ossified
As a Rose of the Oceanside

[It bloomed]

Too long till the light of the morning
So unseen, as light in a dream
Too long now to the rising
Too long now to the rising

[It wilted]

Can you be slow for a little while?
Widow your soul for another mile?
I'm just the same as when
You saw me back then
And we're bound to be reconciled
We're bound to be reconciled

[It bloomed]

Too long swinging the knife
All will wash over you, in a night so unending
Not long now to the rising
Not long now to the rising

[It wilted]

Anna, you're lost in the shadow there
Cinder and smoke hanging in the air
Oh and I know you'll be
Bolder than me, I was high, I was unaware

[It rose]

// Third Of May / Ōdaigahara //

Light ended the night, but the song remained
And I was hiding by the stair, half here, half there, past the lashing rain
And as the sky(e) would petal white
Old innocent lies came to mind
As we stood, congregated, at the firing line

Night ended the fight, but the song remained
And so I headed to the wall, turned tail to call to the new domain
As if in the sight of sea, you're suddenly free, but it's all the same...
Oh, but I can hear you, loud in the center
Aren't we made to be crowded together, like leaves?

Was I too slow?
Did you change overnight?
Second son, on the other line...

Now, back in our town as a castaway
I'm reminded of the time it all fell in line, on the third of May
As if it were designed, painted in sand to be washed away
Oh, but I can hear you, loud in the center
Aren't we made to be crowded together, like leaves?

Was I too slow?
Did I change overnight?
Second son, for the second time...

Can I be light and free?
If I lead you through the fury will you call to me?
And is all that I might owe you carved on ivory?

But all will fade. All I say. All I needed
As a flash in the eye, I wouldn't deny, all receded

Life unfolds in pools of gold
I am only owed this shape if I make a line to hold
To be held within one's self is deathlike, oh I know

But all will be, for mine and me, as we make it
And the size of the fray, can't take it away, they won't make it

I was a fool
Crime after crime to confess to
But I hold the fleet angel, she'll bless you
Hold fast to the wing. Hold fast to the wing

// If You Need To, Keep Time On Me //

[January 20th, 2017]

How could it all fall in one day?
Were we too sure of the sun?

If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

Who knows what State is in store?
If they all turn, will you run?

If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

When I need to, I'll keep time on you

(Wide/white) oceans roar
A frightened fool stokes
(Heedless/heatless) fire

But if you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

How could it all fall in one day?
Were we too sure of the sun?

If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

// Mearcstapa //

Two lines in the air
Two eyes on the pair
Mearcstapa, on an open sea
But you turn away
No falling today
No wind in the night
You're putting slack in the lines

The eyes of the sea
So easy to meet
Mearcstapa, deaf and blind like me
But the foam doesn't sing
The phone doesn't ring
So what will you find
Mearcstapa of mine?

// On Another Ocean (January / June) //

[January]
[Dorian]

Biding your time
On the other ocean
Falling into line
In the cold and dim

Wherever you run
You see all you leave behind you
Lies inside anyone you open

On the other ocean
On the other ocean
On the other ocean

Was he not quite
As you had conceived him?
Did the color of the light
Hide the fight in the eyes?

Wherever you run
You see only eyes behind you
Lies inside anyone you open

On the other ocean
On the other ocean
On the other ocean
On the other ocean

[Alright, time to get over it, buddy]

[Cut to June]

So, do
You think the smoke it won't enfold you?
Or there'll be someone waiting for you
Off in the distance, then?

If only anything could change you
If only you knew what you claim to
If only every sign you cling to
If only they were so

Turn any eye into the ivy
And I won't bleed out if I know me
Allajjliiiineeed oh don't deny me
You ended up too strained
Oh I would lead it in the morning
Oh I won't even if I know it
Allliiiiaajjjllliineeed, oh don't deny me
We're in the (eye/I) sometimes...

Too young
Too
Too young
Too

[Major]

// Fool's Errand //

I knew you fine, sight dream of mine
But I know my eyes they've often lied
And I move like blood, like fire and flood
Despite you

Blind love couldn't win
As the facts all came in
But I know I'll again chase after wind
What have I got if not a thought?

I knew, oh I knew
I knew

It was a fool's errand
Waiting for a sign
I can't leave until the sight comes to mind
A fool's errand

Life will repeat
Vision I see
The mouth and the teeth
That's fine with me
What have I got if not a thought?

I knew, oh I knew
I knew

It was a fool's errand
Waiting for a sign
But I can't leave until the sign comes to mind
A fool's errand

But I can make it through
I was thin and I saw All Life in you
A fool's errand

// I Should See Memphis //

Endless vacation
Felt like perdition
Sybarite woman
Stood at attention
Pacing the basement
Like Cassius in Rome
Or in Kinshasa
Just let me at him
Like First Manassas
Like Appomattox
I've got my teeth in it
I won't let go

[A:] (But I gave you no option
Illusion of choosing.)

[B:] (And if you wouldn't stop them
Then you just hate losing.)

I miss the highway
I should see Memphis
She sees it my way
Her and Osiris

(...I don't think he got it)

// Crack-Up //

So the mind won't lie
And the arm won't set
And the bright red eye
Isn't off you yet

So the words won't come
And the hand won't touch
And a midnight sun
Doesn't look like much

As an iris contracts
Facing the day

(I can tell you've cracked
Like a china plate.)

[Iceberg]

When the world insists
That the false is so
With a philippic, as Cicero
"The tighter the fist
The looser the sand"

(If I don't resist
Will I understand?)

Ooh, ooh, ooh

[A bright clearing]

All things change
Dividing tides
Far as I can see
All fades through
But a (light/lie) of you
As Eellllyyaaalliiiiiyyy

All I see...
Dividing tides...
Rising over me...

[Exit]
