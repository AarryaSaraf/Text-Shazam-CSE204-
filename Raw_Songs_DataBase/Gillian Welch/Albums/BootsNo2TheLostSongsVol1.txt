// Johnny Dear //

Two whole years of a millworker's life
All worn out by noon
Johnny dear, don't take a wife
I'll be coming home soon

First hard snow killed the old sow
Farm and family's all fine
Jenny-o, no time now
But I'll write more next time

More hard times than I can endure
From a letter so cold and strange
Johnny mine, I'm not sure
I'm so scared you've changed

Stars above, know it's true
We can never be one
Johnny love, I'd die for you
Though our time is done

// First Place Ribbon //

Kathy never would wear britches
Kathy never would wear shoes
She's the kinda girl, likes some dust between her toes
Since she never gets the blues

Met her on a Sunday at the county fair
With a first place ribbon in her hair

Oh, Kathy never did like preachers
Didn't like to tell the truth
Caught my eye, no she was not shy
I was a'walking by the kissing booth

Met her on a Sunday at the county fair
With a first place ribbon in her hair

(What'd you get that ribbon for, Kathy?)

Oh Kathy never would be bridled
Wouldn't ever settle down
Broke my heart, and I bawl and cry
Every time the fair's in town

Met her on a Sunday at the county fair
With a first place ribbon in her hair

// Give That Man A Road //

Saw a man
Standing at the crossroads
With a tear on his face
There was a man
Waiting for an invention
And a moment of grace

You're gonna give that man a road
He can walk on
Give that man a road to Jesus
You're gonna give that man a road
He can walk on
Give that man a road to Jesus

There was a man
Down in the dark of the valley
With a chain on his hand
Yeah, there was a man
Meant to walk in the sunshine
Be the light of the land

You're gonna give that man a road
He can walk on
Give that man a road to Jesus
You're gonna give that man a road
He can walk on
Give that man a road to Jesus

I'm gonna push
Onward in my journey
To the promised land
I'm gonna shout
Glory to king Jesus
Upon rocks and sand

You're gonna give that man a road
He can walk on
Give that man a road to Jesus
You're gonna give that man a road
He can walk on
Give that man a road to Jesus

// Mighty Good Book //

There's a mighty good book and it tells a story
It's a bible on a shelf
Oh you know the names and you know the stories
Have you ever read it for yourself?

It's a mighty good book
It's a mighty good book
Of the man who died on the way
It's a mighty good book
It's a mighty good book
And it's just as true today

Oh it tells of the hill in land of Zion
Where they took a man who made no crime
While the wicked watched and the women were cryin'
And the sun refused to shine

It's a mighty good book
It's a mighty good book
Of the man who died on the way
It's a mighty good book
It's a mighty good book
And it's just as true today

Now there's gonna come a day when you go to glory
And you're gonna hear the master's call
Are you gonna wish you read the story
Of when Jesus paid it all?

It's a mighty good book
It's a mighty good book
Of the man who died on the way
It's a mighty good book
It's a mighty good book
And it's just as true today

It's a mighty good book
It's a mighty good book
And it's just as true today

// Chinatown //

Sundown and the bells are warning
Did I miss the mailman again?
No, he had nothing for me
And nobody called today
And no one knows what to say
Black sun is beating down
On Chinatown

All of the sweetest flowers
They grow up on the sunny side
But down here, it's the darkest hour
And we run the other way
Midnight to yesterday
And we're always upside down
In Chinatown

Oh, though I tried to manage
You don't understand my mind
Our love used to speak in Spanish
There's a poison in the air
The fever's everywhere
Bad haze that hangs around
In Chinatown

Bad haze that hangs around
In Chinatown

// Fly Down //

Fly down, fly down, my angel
And light on my right knee
I need a little comfort
Some gentle company

Fly down, fly down, my angel
And stay close by my side
Hard times have come a-callin'
They will not be denied

All at once I feel a bitter wail
There's darkness in my doorway
That's howling to get in

Fly down, fly down, my angel
I'm standing in the track
And I hear the beating thunder
Of that dark horse doubling back

Fly down, fly down, my angel
And take hold of my hand
I walk this world of sorrow
Alone upon the land

All at once the darkness comes again
If I were to meet an angel
If I could find a friend

Fly down, fly down, my angel
And light on my right knee
I need a little comfort
Some gentle company

// Shotgun Song //

Well I wish I had a shotgun
I'd tie it to my side
Never me without the power
To make a man do right
Steady on my shoulders
Standing in the wind
Well I've been down before
But I won't be down again

And if I had a pony
How fast I would ride
Yippie-tiy-iy-ay
With the shotgun at my side
An outlaw to my foes
A hero to my friends
I've been down before
But I won't be down again

Well the days would be so easy
The nights would be so slow
I'd turn my pony south, boys
And ride to Mexico
My pockets full of silver
To gamble or to lay
Cause I've been down before
But I won't be down again

But I ain't got no silver
No pony, no gun
All I got's this hammer
Like old John Henry swung
Been ten years on this chain gang
One more day, and then
I've been down before
But I won't be down again

Now standing on this rock pile
Of four and twenty men
Well I've been down before
But I won't be down again
I've been down before
But I won't be down again

// Apalachicola //

Apalachicola ain't my kind of town
Apalachicola ain't my kind of town
I was going back to Cali
Now I'm Apalachicola bound
And Apalachicola ain't my kind of town

They hauled me to the station
In a cuff and chains
Hauled me to the station
In a cuff in chains
I was bluer than a bottle
Of Apalachicola rain

I told them I was guilty
Thought I'd rest in jail
Told them I was guilty
Thought I'd rest in jail
But in Apalachicola
They make you fill an orchard pail

Apalachicola ain't my kind of town
Apalachicola ain't my kind of town
I was going back to Cali
Now I'm Apalachicola bound
And Apalachicola ain't my kind of town

Oranges in the summer
Oranges in the fall
Oranges in the wintertime
But they're tough and small
Then I wish I hadn't come
To Apalachicola town at all

// Strange Isabella //

Strange Isabella
Never had a coat to wear
Strange Isabella
Leaves her perfume in the air

Says, "What do I care about the cold?
It'll never freeze my tongue
What do I care about the rain?
It never rains where I come from"

Strange Isabella
Never learned to tie her shoes
Strange Isabella
She never had the walkin' blues

Says, "What do I care about the cold?
It'll never freeze my tongue
What do I care about the rain?
It never rains where I come from"

Strange Isabella
Never had to wash her hands
Strange Isabella
Have pity on the workin' man

And what do I care about the cold?
It'll never freeze my tongue
And what do I care about the rain?
It never rains where I come from

Strange Isabella
Strange Isabella
Strange Isabella

// Little Luli //

How many nickels does it take
To see Little Lulu's body shake?
It takes a nickel, it'll take a dime
To see Little Lulu's body shine

Dance Little Luli
Shine and sing
Dance Little Luli
Trying to get to heaven 'fore the church bells ring

All of the boys in Lulaville
Know where to spend a dollar bill
Feet a-poundin' like a .44
Dust comin' up through the cracks in the floor

Dance Little Luli
Shine and sing
Dance Little Luli
Trying to get to heaven 'fore the church bells ring

Where did you get your diamond ring?
All the other pretty things?
Got the diamond from candyman
I wanna hear from him again

Dance Little Luli
Shine and sing
Dance Little Luli
Trying to get to heaven 'fore the church bells ring

I've been down in Bowling Green
I've been far as Abilene
Anytime that I'm in town
I want to see miss Lulu Brown

Dance Little Luli
Shine and sing
Dance Little Luli
Trying to get to heaven 'fore the church bells ring

// Valley Of Tears //

I've been riding high
But I don't know why
Everybody wants to send me down
To the valley of tears

It's a sunny day
And I'm on my way
But everybody wants to send me down
To the valley of tears

People stand in a line
Just to hear me cry
And I wanna know
The other side

Everyone I choose
Only brings bad news
Cause everybody wants to send me down
To the valley of tears

People stand in a line
Just to hear me cry
I wanna know
The other side

It's a sunny day
And I'm on my way
But everybody wants to send me down
To the valley of tears
Well everybody wants to send me down
To the valley of tears
Well everybody wants to send me down
To the valley of tears

// Blind On The Inside //

I don't see a sign of sleep
I can't even rhyme tonight
Something here that runs too deep
But I tell you I'm alright

It's fear that holds my tongue
Fear that holds my hand
The race that I must run
'Til I can't stand

I haven't left a lie untold
Still I watch and wait
I will pray and I will hope
That I learn before too late

I will search my barren soul
To see what I can find
Look at me, the last to know
That I have been blind on the inside

// Back Turn And Swing //

Well the fiddler's up and bow is flyin'
Momma's in the kitchen and the bacon is fryin'
Boys can't dance, by God they're tryin'
Every time they hear that call, back turn and swing
Back turn and swing
Back turn and swing
Back turn and swing

All the girls jump up and the win is pourin'
Dust comin' up 'tween the cracks in the floor, an'
The old folks they don't dance anymore
Unless you play somethin' slow, back turn and swing
Back turn and swing
Back turn and swing
Back turn and swing

Well this corn come from Joe McMillan
It's better than all last year, my heavens
Not so sweet, it's fifty seven
That was a summer old, back turn and swing
Back turn and swing
Back turn and swing
Back turn and swing

Well the fiddler's up and bow is flyin'
Momma's in the kitchen and the bacon is fryin'
Boys can't dance, by God they're tryin'
Every time they hear that call back turn and swing
Back turn and swing
Back turn and swing
Back turn and swing

// Roll On //

People a'talking
Said 'everybody knows'
Why am I the last to hear
That you're a no-good so-and-so?

Roll on
Roll on
'Til you get good and gone

This tear I'm crying
Ain't account of you
Just a natural lover feeling
That's the Kansas City blues

So Roll on
Roll on
'Til you get good and gone
Roll on
Roll on
'Til you get good and gone

Now this old muddy river
Rolls to New Orleans
Gonna find a good man there
And several in between

So roll on
Roll on
'Til you get good and gone
Roll on
Roll on
'Til you get good and gone

// Honey Baby //

Our love was sweetest in the spring
And when you gave a wedding ring
I gave to you this golden vow

I got no sugar baby now
I got no honey baby now
I got no honey baby now

Before they caught us in a lie
We crossed our hearts, prepared to die
We crossed our hearts, prepared to die

Down where the cold waters flow
Down where the brushes overgrow
That's where my baby's sleeping, oh

I got no sugar baby now
I got no honey baby now
I got no honey baby now

We went to jail without a shout
The night they came to find us out
The night they came to find us out

But all your money set you free
And saved you from the gallows tree
And saved you from the hanging bough

I got no sugar baby now
I got no honey baby now
I got no honey baby now

// Here Come The News //

What can I do?
What can I do?
I have to prove myself to you

You treat me like a child
Just like a child
You want to feed me 'til I smile

Friends wanna know
They wanna know
Why they don't see me anymore

Here come the news
Here come the news
I've got the big old highway blues

I'm out in the rain
I'm in the rain
Oh, with a need I can't explain

Words that I've said
The words I've said
You'll use against me in the end
