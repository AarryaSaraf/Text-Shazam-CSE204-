// One Little Song //

There's gotta be a song left to sing
'Cause everybody can't have thought of everything
One little song that ain't been sung
One little rag that ain't been wrung out completely yet
Just gotta a little left

One little drop of fallin' rain, one little chance to try again
One little bird that makes it home now and then
One little piece of endless sky, one little taste of cherry pie
One little week in paradise and I start thinkin'

There's gotta be a song left to sing
'Cause everybody can't have thought of everything
One little note that ain't been used
One little word, ain't been abused a thousand times
In a thousand rhymes

One little drop of fallin' rain, one little chance to try again
One little bird that makes it every now and then
One little piece of endless sky, one little taste of cherry pie
One little week in paradise and I start thinkin'

Gotta be a song left to sing
'Cause everybody can't have thought of everything
One little song that ain't been sung
One little rag that ain't been wrung out completely yet
Till there's nothing left, yeah

// Sin City //

I walked from Dallas with a pistol in my hand
I walked from Dallas with a pistol in my hand
I walked from Dallas with a pistol in my hand
Now I feel like a natural man

Been good 'til now
But I'm going down to sin city

200 dollars and a pair of mohair slacks
200 dollars and a pair of mohair slacks
200 dollars and a pair of slacks
That's all I'm taking when I get the tracks

Been good 'til now
But I'm going down to sin city

So don't call my number, 'cause I hate to hear it ring
Don't call my number, 'cause I hate to hear it ring
Don't call my number, 'cause I hate the ring
I know it's trouble if it's anything

Been good 'till now
But I'm going down to sin city

Been good 'til now
But I'm going down to sin city

Been good 'til now
But I'm going down to sin city

Been good 'til now
But I'm going down
You're gonna miss me, darling
When I'm not around

Been good 'til now
But I'm going down to sin city
Sin City

// Turn It Up //

Rolling out of Raleigh, been trying to make a living
Listening to the station with a rockabilly rhythm
Down about Atlanta and I started slowing
Might need a little bit of something just to keep a-going

Mm, I got nothing
Nothing like enough
Nothing but a little cold coffee in a cup
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

Birmingham never been a long time coming
All the way to Jackson, got the radio a-humming
Trying to make Dallas, but my head kept chugging
Wish I had a little 'cause I gotta keep the motor working

Mm, I got nothing
Nothing like enough
Nothing but a little cold coffee in a cup
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

Last four miles, got my hand on the buckle
Gonna get some loving from a certain honeysuckle
He's my sugar and he's been there waiting
It's been a long time Betty, don't be hesitating

Mm, I got nothing
Nothing like enough
Nothing but a little cold coffee in a cup
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

Mm, I got nothing
Nothing like enough
Nothing but a little cold coffee in a cup
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up

// Strangers Again //

Hello, stranger, lover, friend
Hello, angel on the mend
There's a side of you
That I never knew
As you shed another skin
We're strangers again

Hello, trouble in my arms
There was another one with your charms
And he had your name
You are not the same
Boy, I knew back then
We're strangers again

Hello, rain man in the mirror
Now I see you've noticed all these tears
We can start anew
If you're willing
To smile and pretend
We're strangers again

If we met before
I am very sure
That I would remember when
We're strangers again

// What Can I Do //

A strange embrace
That stays in time
A poison halo
Pervades your mind
I feel it too
But what can I do?

You lost your sparkle
And your cigarettes
You found an angel
Who'll take your bets
She called back for you
But what can I do?

What can I do for you, darling?
I'd love to know
'Cause I love you so

It wouldn't matter
I you hit the heights
The cash in millions
Or your name in lights
You'd still be blue
But what can I do?

What can I do?

// Make Me Down A Pallet On Your Floor //

Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet soft and low
When I'm broke and I got nowhere to go

Been hanging 'round with a good-time friends of mine
Hanging around with a good-time friends of mine
Oh, they treat me very nice and kind
When I've got a dollar and a dime

Weary blues everywhere I see
Weary blues everywhere I see
Weary blues, honey, everywhere I see
No one ever had the blues like me

Way I'm sleeping, my back and shoulders tired
Way I'm sleeping, my back and shoulders tired
Come tomorrow, I'll be satisfied
If I can catch that fast train and ride

So, make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet soft and low
I'm broke and I got nowhere to go

// City Girl //

The good old boys, always messing me up
Their pickup lines in their pickup trucks
The city girl wouldn't fall so hard
For a redneck boy with a V8 Ford

I ain't no city girl, I ain't no fool
That's why I'm falling for you
Some girls want everything wrapped up in gold
Just something precious to hold
I don't want diamonds or pearls
I ain't no city girl

I've seen girls waiting much too long
While the real good things been here and gone
They don't seem hard to understand
If it makes you smile, you better take his hand

I ain't no city girl, I ain't no fool
That's why I'm falling for you
Some girls want everything wrapped up in gold
Just something precious to hold
I don't want diamonds or pearls
I ain't no city girl

// How's About You //

Mud on my shoes, shoes on my feet
I've been walking up and down the street
Buddy, I've seen a thing or two
How's about you?

Ain't got a nickel, I'm broken down flat
Wish I had one of those porkpie hats
'Cause this old rain's about soaked through
How's about you?

How's about you? Ain't you been walking too?
Seems a lotta good people are getting bad news
How's about you? Ain't you got nothing to sing?
Well, I used to have a dollar, I'm gonna have a dime someday

Man in the church, man on the hill
Says he won't hurt me, but I know he will
I've been worrying the whole night through
How's about you?

How's about you? Ain't you been walking too?
Seems a lotta good people are getting bad news
How's about you? Ain't you got nothing to sing?
Well, I used to have a dollar, I'm gonna have a dime someday

Criminal man, ain't behind bars
He's a-driving one of them Cadillac cars
I'm gonna switch sides real soon
How's about you?

How's about you? Ain't you been walking too?
Seems a lotta good people are getting bad news
How's about you? Ain't you got nothing to sing?
Well, I used to have a dollar, I'm gonna have a dime someday

// Changing Ground //

I have stood on the changing ground
I have walked like a man in chains
I tried hard to do my best
But I could not make my way

Oh, trouble was on my tail
And he dogged me like a hound
'Til I moved one step onto glory
And off of that changing ground

There was a rumbling out of my feet
There was a howling in the air
And when the tempest broke
I made a mighty prayer

But no one was at my side
And no hiding place I found
'Til I moved one step onto glory
And off of that changing ground

And when I took his hand, I was real arranged
I cried out, "My God, I'm changed!"
Tell me Lord, what can I do?
He said, "Tell your sister and your brother, too"
And I testified His truth:

I have stood on the changing ground
I have walked like a man in chains
I tried hard to do my best
But I could not make my way

Oh, trouble was on my tail
And he dogged me like a hound
'Til I moved one step onto glory
And off of that changing ground

Changing ground

// If I Ain't Going To Heaven //

If I ain't going to heaven, don't care where I go
If I ain't going to heaven, don't care where I go
Hold me out in the cold rain and snow
If I ain't going to heaven, don't care where I go

Gonna drink corn liquor 'til my blood runs clear
Gonna drink corn liquor 'til my blood runs clear
Call me drunk and so and so
If I ain't going to heaven, don't care where I go

If you ain't got religion, you are dead always
If you ain't got religion, you're dead always
I believe what the bible says
If you ain't got religion, you're dead always

Been walking this morning and my feet are tired
Been walking this morning, my feet are tired
Miles and miles on a desert low
If I ain't going to heaven, don't care where I go

// Peace In The Valley //

Pulling into Douglas on a hot October night
Dawn up above us, and there's a moon on the right
Just off the blacktop, there's a sign along the road
It's a marker for the place where they got Geronimo

For peace in the valley, lay down his shield
And surrendered to the white man hot on his heels
Peace in the valley but oh, Geronimo
You can't raise up your children, watch them grow
Without peace in the valley down below

He was a bonafide Indian chief
East Arizona was his pride and keep
Down through the Pecos, they tried to take him down
'Til an hour from the border, he stopped and turned around

He cried "Peace in the valley!", lay down his shield
And surrendered to the white man hot on his heels
Peace in the valley but oh, Geronimo
You can't raise up your children and watch them grow
Without peace in the valley down below

Peace in the valley but oh, Geronimo
You can't raise up your children and watch them grow
Without peace in the valley down below

// Cowboy Rides Away //

Last call was an hour ago
Some drinking up and going home
I'm counting you a no-show
So what can I say?

I ought to be leaving town
Start walking with my head turned down
I can't afford to hang around
For one more day

I'm waiting on a used-to-be
I should be flying free
Saint Chris is awaiting me
The rideaway

I ought to be leaving town
Start walking with my head turned down
I can't afford to hang around
For one more day

I don't even want to stay
And everybody knows that the cowboy rides away

// There's A First Time For Everything //

There's a first time for everything

Take the first time we met and said our brave hellos
I will never forget you were looking at your toes
When I finally caught your eye it was like a sudden spring
There's a first time for everything

Take the first time we kissed on that night full of love
Too perfect to resist, it was heaven above
And I thought we were there 'cause I heard angels sing
There's a first time for everything

There's a first time, it happens just a moment and yet
There's a feeling inside that you never forget

Take the first time you laughed and said you were true
That you never had tried the things cheaters do
And it's too bad I had to hear her whispering
There's a first time for everything

There's a first time, it happens just a moment and yet
There's a feeling inside that you never forget

Take the first time you cried when I gave back your ring
There's a first time for everything
There's a first time for everything

// Wanted Man //

I like the way you walk
I like the way you stand
I like the way you laugh
Across the back of your hand

'Cause your greasy smile
Never quite gives out
I'd like to know
What the joke's about

I know you talk too loud
I know you drink too much
You got a gambler's knack
Of never losing your luck

When the cards are bare
And you let 'em fall
But you take it hard
As your alcohol

Wanted man, wanted man
Wanted man, wanted man

Oh, when the lights came up
And I caught you into me
The flash of something white
The moment you came to me

You've got a wounded past
And a bloody hand
You're a wanted man
You're a wanted man

You're a wanted man
You're a wanted man

// Put Your Foot Upon The Path //

You've been living fancy fine
You've been doing as you please
This life of your design
Will bring you to your knees

'Cause there is no road so rough
Even angels feel the tread
But when you lose enough
No more circus and no more bread

Put your foot upon the path
Put your hands upon a plow
Never be afraid to laugh
Just be glad that you know how
You can turn your head away
You can drive against the wind
You may leave another day
You may never laugh again

You could read your heart
Like a book upon the shelf
Would you wrestle with the part
Be afraid to be yourself

'Cause the lines are very thin
Your bluff is already called
It's a long, hard road of sin
And that first step feels like a fall

Put your foot upon the path
Put your hands upon a plow
Never be afraid to laugh
Just be glad that you know how
You can turn your head away
You can drive against the wind
You may leave another day
You may never laugh again

You may never laugh again

// Garden Of Love //

If God made little roses
Of heartbroken blue
I'd wear one at my collar
To remind me of you

If God made little flowers
In the color of tears
They'd grow up 'round my doorway
And bloom through the years

Pretty roses, like the blue of the bud
Pretty flowers, my garden of love

You left my heart's tender garden
With the blues falling down
For when your love had faded
The briars twisted 'round

Pretty roses, like the blue of the bud
Pretty flowers, my garden of love

Now I see you in dreams, dear
Your memory stayed
I'll gather them together
In a lover's bouquet

Pretty roses, like the blue of the bud
Pretty flowers, my garden of love

Pretty roses, like the blue of the bud
Pretty flowers, my garden of love

// Streets Of St. Paul //

There's too much wrist at the end of his coat
Too much bitter at the back of his throat
Too much winter coming after the fall
To be walking the streets of St. Paul
To be walking the streets of St. Paul

There's too much makeup for the time of day
Too much of high heel and way too much leg
Too much of 14 underneath it all
To be walking the streets of St. Paul
To be walking the streets of St. Paul

Oh, see the little sparrow
Who's watching? Who's watching?
I see the little sparrow

Too much troubles for me to shake
All this weather and blinding ache
Makes my body feel sad and small
Walking the streets of St. Paul
Walking the streets of St. Paul
