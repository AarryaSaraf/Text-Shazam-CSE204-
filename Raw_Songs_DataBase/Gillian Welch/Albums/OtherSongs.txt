// I Just Came Home To Count The Memories //

I saw roses choking in the grass flaking paint in a broken window pane
A mailbox barely standin' by the driveway I can almost read the name
A swing set and forgotten toys where little girls and boys played happy games
Everything I ever care about is gone now but the mem'ries still remain

The old man from the house across the street asked how's it goin' and I said fine
But the expression on his face would make me think that he could almost read my mind
That Johnson boy from down the road was asking if the kids could come and play
Lord I wish I could have told them yes but I just said I guess son not today

I just came home to count the mem'ries that I've been carrying in my mind
Just came home to count the mem'ries of a better day and time

All the birds that sang a pretty song aren't singing like they did when we were here
Cause there's no happiness in music if somebody isn't close enough to care
I picked arranged daisy from its home out in the corner of the yard
He loves me he loves me not
Now I don't have to wonder anymore

I just came home to count the mem'ries that I've been carrying in my mind
I just came home to count the mem'ries of a better day and time
I just came home to count the mem'ries that I've been carrying in my mind
I just came home to count the mem'ries I guess it's time to say goodbye

// When A Cowboy Trades His Spurs For Wings //

Let me tell you, buddy
There's a faster gun
Coming over yonder
When tomorrow comes

Let me tell you, buddy
And it won't be long
Till you find yourself singing
Your last cowboy song

Yippee-ki-iy-ay
When the round-up ends
Yippee-ki-iy-ay
And the campfire dims

Yippee-ki-iy-ay
He shouts and he sings
When a cowboy trades his spurs for wings

When they wrap my body
In the thin linen sheet
And they take my six irons
Pull the boots from my feet

Unsaddle my pony
She'll be itching to roam
I'll be halfway to heaven
Under horsepower of my own

Yippee-ki-iy-ay
When the round-up ends
Yippee-ki-iy-ay
And the campfire dims

Yippee-ki-iy-ay
He shouts and he sings
When a cowboy trades his spurs for wings

Yippee-ki-iy-ay
I'm glory-bound
No more jingle jangle
I lay my guns down

Yippee-ki-iy-ay
He shouts and he sings
When a cowboy trades his spurs for wings
