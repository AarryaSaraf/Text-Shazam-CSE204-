// Oh Babe It Ain't No Lie //

One old woman, Lord, in this town
Keep telling those lies on me
I wish to my soul that old woman would die
Keep telling those lies on me

Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Know this life I live is mighty high

I've been all around this whole wide world
That I just got back today
Work like a dog, honey, all week through
Honey babe, what more can I say?

Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Know this life I live is mighty high

Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Oh babe, it ain't no lie
Know this life I live is mighty high

// Señor //

Señor, Señor, do you know where we're heading?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Seems like I been down this way before
Is there any truth in that, Señor?

Señor, Señor, do you know where she is hiding?
How long are we gonna be riding?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Will there be any comfort there, Señor?

There's a wicked wind still blowin' on that upper deck
There's an iron cross still hanging down from around her neck
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Where she held me in her arms one time and said, "Forget me not"

Señor, Señor, I can hear that painted wagon
I can smell the tail of the dragon
Can't stand the suspense anymore
Can you tell me who to contact here, Señor?

Well, the last thing that I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Was the trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring
She said, "Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing"

Señor, Señor, you know their hearts is as hard as leather
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor
I'm ready when you are, Señor

Señor, Señor, let's overturn these tables
And disconnect these cables
This place don't make sense to me no more
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Señor?

// Fly Around My Pretty Little Miss //

Fly around my pretty little miss
Fly around my honey
Fly around my pretty little miss
I'll see you next Sunday

Higher up the cherry tree
Sweeter grow the cherries
The more you hug and kiss a girl
The sooner she will marry

Fly around my pretty little miss
Fly around my honey
Fly around my pretty little miss
I'll see you next Sunday

If I had a snow white ship
I'd sail away tomorrow
If I had a silver sail
I'd fly away from sorrow

Fly around my pretty little miss
Fly around my honey
Fly around my pretty little miss
I'll see you next Sunday

Go and get your weevily wheat
Go and get your barley
Go and get your weevily wheat
Gonna bake a cake for Charlie

Fly around my pretty little miss
Fly around my honey
Fly around my pretty little miss
I'll see you next Sunday

Coffee grows on a white oak tree
And the river flows with brandy
If I had that little girl
I'd feed her sugar candy

Fly around my pretty little miss
Fly around my honey
Fly around my pretty little miss
I'll see you next Sunday

// Hello In There //

We had an apartment in the city
Me and Loretta liked living there
It'd been years since the kids had grown
A life of their own, left us alone

John and Linda live in Omaha
And Joe is somewhere on the road
And we lost Davy in the Korean War
And I still don't know what for, don't matter anymore

You know that old trees just grow stronger
Old rivers grow wider every day
Old people just grow lonesome
Waiting for someone to say, "Hello in there, hello"

Me and Loretta, we don't talk much more
She sits and stares through the backdoor screen
And all the news just repeats itself
Like some old forgotten dream, one that we've both seen

Someday I'll go call up Rudy
We worked together at the factory
But what could I say if he asks "What's new?"
"Nothing, what's with you? Nothing much to do"

You know that old trees just grow stronger
Old rivers grow wider every day
Old people just grow lonesome
Waiting for someone to say, "Hello in there, hello"

So if you're walking down the street sometime
And spot some hollow ancient eyes
Please don't just pass 'em by and stare
As if you didn't care, say, "Hello in there, hello"

// Poor Ellen Smith //

Poor Ellen Smith, how was she found?
Shot through the heart, lying cold on the ground
Her curves were all matted, her clothes scattered around
Blood marked the spot where old Ellen was found
They picked up her body and off they did go
To the lonesome graveyard, I'll see her no more

They picked up their rifles, running me down
They caught me loafing in my old town
They sent me to prison for twenty long years
At night, I see Ellen and cry bitter tears
The warden just told me that soon I'd be free
To visit her grave under that old willow tree

I'm going to Winston, I'll stay there a year
It's often I think of sweet Ellen so dear
Poor Ellen Smith, how was she found?
Shot through the heart, lying cold on the ground

// All The Good Times Are Past And Gone //

I wish to the Lord I'd never been born
Or died when I was young
I'd never have seen your sparkling blue eyes
Or heard your lying tongue

All the good times are past and gone
All the good times are o'er
All the good times are past and gone
Little darling, don't you weep no more

Come back, come back, my own true love
And stay awhile with me
If ever I had a friend in this world
You've been a friend to me

All the good times are past and gone
All the good times are o'er
All the good times are past and gone
Little darling, don't you weep no more

Now don't you see that [?] train
Coming around the bend
It'll take me away from this dirty old town
Never to return again

Now don't you see that lonesome dove
It flies from pine to pine
He's mourning for his only true love
Just like I mourn for mine

All the good times are past and gone
All the good times are o'er
All the good times are past and gone
Little darling, don't you weep no more

// Ginseng Sullivan //

Not too far from the battleyard
On a reverse curve on down
Not two miles of the town depot
Sullivan's shack was found
Back on the higher ground

You could see him every day
Walking on down the line
Old brown sack across his back
Long hair down behind
Speaking his worried mind

It's long way from the Delta
From the North Georgia Hills
And a tote sack full of ginseng
Don't pay no traveling bills
I'm too old to ride the rails
Or thumb the road alone
So I guess I'll never make it back to home
My muddy water Mississippi Delta home

Now the winters here, they get too cold
The damp, it makes me ill
Can't dig no roots on a mountainside
With the ground froze hard and still
Gotta stay at the foot of the hill

But next summer, when things turn right
The companies will pay high
I'll make enough money to pay my bills
And bid this mountain goodbye
Then he said with a smile

It's long way from the Delta
From the North Georgia Hills
And a tote sack full of ginseng
Don't pay no traveling bills
I'm too old to ride the rails
Or thumb the road alone
So I guess I'll never make it back to home
My muddy water Mississippi Delta home

// Abandoned Love //

I can see the turning of the key
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain

My patron saint is fighting with a ghost
He's always off somewhere when I need him most
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill
But my heart is tellin' me I love you still

Come back to the town from the flaming moon
I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon
I love to see you dress before the mirror
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?

Everybody's wearing a disguise
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes
But me, I can't cover what I am
Wherever children go, I'll follow them

I march in the parade of liberty
But as long as I love you, I'm not free
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?

I've given up the game, I've got to leave
The treasure can't be found, it's make-believe
The pot of gold is found by men who search
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church

Now we sat in an empty theater and we kissed
I asked you please to cross me off your list
My head tells me it's time to make a change
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange

So one more time at midnight near the wall
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl
Won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit?
Let me feel your love one more time before I...

// Jackson //

We got married in a fever
Hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin' about Jackson
Ever since the fire went out

I'm goin' to Jackson
Gonna mess around
Oh yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson
Look out Jackson town

Now honey, go on down to Jackson
Go ahead and wreck your health
Go and play your hand, you big-talkin' man
Make a big fool of yourself

Yeah, go on to Jackson
Go comb your hair
I'm gonna snowball in Jackson
See if I care

When I breeze into that city
The people gonna stoop and bow
All them ladies gonna make me
Show 'em what they don't know how

I'm goin' to Jackson
You turnin' loose in my coat
Oh yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson
Goodbye, that's all she wrote

Honey, go on down to Jackson
And I'll be dancin' on a Pony Keg
They'll lead you downtown like a scared hound
With your tail tucked between your legs

Yeah, go on to Jackson
You big-talkin' man
And I'll be waitin' there in Jackson
Behind a Japan fan

Well, we got married in a fever
Hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin' about Jackson
Ever since the fire went out

We're going to Jackson
We're gonna mess around
Oh yeah, we're going to Jackson
Look out Jackson town

// Y'all Come //

When you live in the country everybody is your neighbor
On this two things you can rely
They will all come see you and never never leave you
Sayin' "Y'all come see us by and by"

Y'all come (y'all come) y'all come
Oh, y'all come see us now and then
Y'all come (y'all come) y'all come
Oh, y'all come and see us when you can

Kin folks are comin', they're comin' by the dozen
They're bringing everything from soup to hay
And right after dinner, they ain't lookin' any thinner
And that's when you hear them say

Y'all come (y'all come) y'all come
Oh, y'all come see us now and then
Y'all come (y'all come) y'all come
Oh, y'all come and see us when you can

Now grandma's wishin' they'd come into the kitchen
And help do the dishes right away
And although they're leavin' and grandma is grievin'
You can still hear grandma say

Y'all come (y'all come) y'all come
Oh, y'all come see us now and then
Y'all come (y'all come) y'all come
Oh, y'all come and see us when you can

Y'all come (y'all come) y'all come
Oh, y'all come see us now and then
Y'all come (y'all come) y'all come
Oh, y'all come and see us when you can
