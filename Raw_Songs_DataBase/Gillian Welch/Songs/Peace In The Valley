Pulling into Douglas on a hot October night
Dawn up above us, and there's a moon on the right
Just off the blacktop, there's a sign along the road
It's a marker for the place where they got Geronimo

For peace in the valley, lay down his shield
And surrendered to the white man hot on his heels
Peace in the valley but oh, Geronimo
You can't raise up your children, watch them grow
Without peace in the valley down below

He was a bonafide Indian chief
East Arizona was his pride and keep
Down through the Pecos, they tried to take him down
'Til an hour from the border, he stopped and turned around

He cried "Peace in the valley!", lay down his shield
And surrendered to the white man hot on his heels
Peace in the valley but oh, Geronimo
You can't raise up your children and watch them grow
Without peace in the valley down below

Peace in the valley but oh, Geronimo
You can't raise up your children and watch them grow
Without peace in the valley down below
