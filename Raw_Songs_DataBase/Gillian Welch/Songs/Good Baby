Good baby, good baby, why do you cry?
Are you cold and tired or hungry and sad?
Good baby, good baby, tears upon your breast
Hush now, your mama is trying to rest

Good baby, good baby, don't be afraid
Daddy knows all the places where the lions have laid
Deep as a mountain, down in the pine
Good baby, good baby, always true and kind

Who will rock the cradle? Who will sing a song?
All the time she's walkin' with red shoes on
I'll rock the cradle, I'll sing a song
Good baby, good baby, when she's dead and gone

Good baby, good baby smiling at the mouth
Days will be warmer as we fly south
Down to the river, dark as a plow
Good baby, good baby, you're my baby now

Good baby, good baby, you're my baby now
