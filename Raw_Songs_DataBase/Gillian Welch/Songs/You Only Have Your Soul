Oh my darling, pal of mine
Be careful what you sign
Be careful what you sign on the line
Give them silver and your gold
If you only have your soul
You only have your soul for all time

Please don't play the devil's game
To trick him out of fame
To trick him out of fame if you lose
'Cause he's smarter than you
Unblinking and untrue
Unblinking and untrue all his days

Oh my darling, pal of mine
Be careful what you sign
Be careful what you sign on the line
Give them silver and your gold
If you only have your soul
You only have your soul for all time
