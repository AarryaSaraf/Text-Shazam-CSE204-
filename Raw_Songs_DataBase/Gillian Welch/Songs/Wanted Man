I like the way you walk
I like the way you stand
I like the way you laugh
Across the back of your hand

'Cause your greasy smile
Never quite gives out
I'd like to know
What the joke's about

I know you talk too loud
I know you drink too much
You got a gambler's knack
Of never losing your luck

When the cards are bare
And you let 'em fall
But you take it hard
As your alcohol

Wanted man, wanted man
Wanted man, wanted man

Oh, when the lights came up
And I caught you into me
The flash of something white
The moment you came to me

You've got a wounded past
And a bloody hand
You're a wanted man
You're a wanted man

You're a wanted man
You're a wanted man
