Fly down, fly down, my angel
And light on my right knee
I need a little comfort
Some gentle company

Fly down, fly down, my angel
And stay close by my side
Hard times have come a-callin'
They will not be denied

All at once I feel a bitter wail
There's darkness in my doorway
That's howling to get in

Fly down, fly down, my angel
I'm standing in the track
And I hear the beating thunder
Of that dark horse doubling back

Fly down, fly down, my angel
And take hold of my hand
I walk this world of sorrow
Alone upon the land

All at once the darkness comes again
If I were to meet an angel
If I could find a friend

Fly down, fly down, my angel
And light on my right knee
I need a little comfort
Some gentle company
