We got married in a fever
Hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin' about Jackson
Ever since the fire went out

I'm goin' to Jackson
Gonna mess around
Oh yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson
Look out Jackson town

Now honey, go on down to Jackson
Go ahead and wreck your health
Go and play your hand, you big-talkin' man
Make a big fool of yourself

Yeah, go on to Jackson
Go comb your hair
I'm gonna snowball in Jackson
See if I care

When I breeze into that city
The people gonna stoop and bow
All them ladies gonna make me
Show 'em what they don't know how

I'm goin' to Jackson
You turnin' loose in my coat
Oh yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson
Goodbye, that's all she wrote

Honey, go on down to Jackson
And I'll be dancin' on a Pony Keg
They'll lead you downtown like a scared hound
With your tail tucked between your legs

Yeah, go on to Jackson
You big-talkin' man
And I'll be waitin' there in Jackson
Behind a Japan fan

Well, we got married in a fever
Hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin' about Jackson
Ever since the fire went out

We're going to Jackson
We're gonna mess around
Oh yeah, we're going to Jackson
Look out Jackson town
