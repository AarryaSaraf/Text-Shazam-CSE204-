How many nickels does it take
To see Little Lulu's body shake?
It takes a nickel, it'll take a dime
To see Little Lulu's body shine

Dance Little Luli
Shine and sing
Dance Little Luli
Trying to get to heaven 'fore the church bells ring

All of the boys in Lulaville
Know where to spend a dollar bill
Feet a-poundin' like a .44
Dust comin' up through the cracks in the floor

Dance Little Luli
Shine and sing
Dance Little Luli
Trying to get to heaven 'fore the church bells ring

Where did you get your diamond ring?
All the other pretty things?
Got the diamond from candyman
I wanna hear from him again

Dance Little Luli
Shine and sing
Dance Little Luli
Trying to get to heaven 'fore the church bells ring

I've been down in Bowling Green
I've been far as Abilene
Anytime that I'm in town
I want to see miss Lulu Brown

Dance Little Luli
Shine and sing
Dance Little Luli
Trying to get to heaven 'fore the church bells ring
