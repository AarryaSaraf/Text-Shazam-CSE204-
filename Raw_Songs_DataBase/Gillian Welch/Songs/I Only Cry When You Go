Here you are, come to tell me you're leaving
Because I'm cold and I don't understand
But you're wrong if you think I'm unfeeling
And I'm tough like a man

'Cause when you go, then my tears'll start falling
You don't see, so, honey, how could you know?
Though you call me a hard-hearted woman
Well, it just isn't so
But I only cry when you go

When I tried not to show any weakness
I thought it best, now I guess I was wrong
'Cause you think that I won't need you to lean on
And you think that I'm strong

But when you go, then my tears'll start falling
You don't see, so, honey, how could you know?
And though you call me a hard-hearted woman
Well, it just isn't so
But I only cry when you go

Though you call me a hard-hearted woman
It just isn't so, oh
But I only cry when you go
