Way down in Dixie, oh do they miss me
Down along the Dixie Line
Banjos are strumming
Horseflies are humming
Ripe melons on the vine
The gold and the grey weeds
Saying look away
Way down along the Dixie Line

I spent my childhood walking the wildwood
Down along the Dixie Line
Freight trains are squalling
Eyeballs are bawling
Four engines at a time
I was so happy with Momma and Pappy
Down along the Dixie Line

Can't you hear those drivers wail?
Can't you see those bright rails shine?
Wanna catch that fireball man
Leave that North Land far behind

A river of whiskey flows down in Dixie
Down along the Dixie Line
They pulled up the tracks now
I can't go back now
Can't hardly keep from cryin'
Oh do they miss me way down in Dixie
Down along the Dixie Line

Can't you hear those drivers wail?
Can't you see those bright rails shine?
Wanna catch that fireball man
Leave that North Land far behind

Down along the Dixie Line
