The good old boys, always messing me up
Their pickup lines in their pickup trucks
The city girl wouldn't fall so hard
For a redneck boy with a V8 Ford

I ain't no city girl, I ain't no fool
That's why I'm falling for you
Some girls want everything wrapped up in gold
Just something precious to hold
I don't want diamonds or pearls
I ain't no city girl

I've seen girls waiting much too long
While the real good things been here and gone
They don't seem hard to understand
If it makes you smile, you better take his hand

I ain't no city girl, I ain't no fool
That's why I'm falling for you
Some girls want everything wrapped up in gold
Just something precious to hold
I don't want diamonds or pearls
I ain't no city girl
