Well I wish I had a shotgun
I'd tie it to my side
Never me without the power
To make a man do right
Steady on my shoulders
Standing in the wind
Well I've been down before
But I won't be down again

And if I had a pony
How fast I would ride
Yippie-tiy-iy-ay
With the shotgun at my side
An outlaw to my foes
A hero to my friends
I've been down before
But I won't be down again

Well the days would be so easy
The nights would be so slow
I'd turn my pony south, boys
And ride to Mexico
My pockets full of silver
To gamble or to lay
Cause I've been down before
But I won't be down again

But I ain't got no silver
No pony, no gun
All I got's this hammer
Like old John Henry swung
Been ten years on this chain gang
One more day, and then
I've been down before
But I won't be down again

Now standing on this rock pile
Of four and twenty men
Well I've been down before
But I won't be down again
I've been down before
But I won't be down again
