When you live in the country everybody is your neighbor
On this two things you can rely
They will all come see you and never never leave you
Sayin' "Y'all come see us by and by"

Y'all come (y'all come) y'all come
Oh, y'all come see us now and then
Y'all come (y'all come) y'all come
Oh, y'all come and see us when you can

Kin folks are comin', they're comin' by the dozen
They're bringing everything from soup to hay
And right after dinner, they ain't lookin' any thinner
And that's when you hear them say

Y'all come (y'all come) y'all come
Oh, y'all come see us now and then
Y'all come (y'all come) y'all come
Oh, y'all come and see us when you can

Now grandma's wishin' they'd come into the kitchen
And help do the dishes right away
And although they're leavin' and grandma is grievin'
You can still hear grandma say

Y'all come (y'all come) y'all come
Oh, y'all come see us now and then
Y'all come (y'all come) y'all come
Oh, y'all come and see us when you can

Y'all come (y'all come) y'all come
Oh, y'all come see us now and then
Y'all come (y'all come) y'all come
Oh, y'all come and see us when you can
