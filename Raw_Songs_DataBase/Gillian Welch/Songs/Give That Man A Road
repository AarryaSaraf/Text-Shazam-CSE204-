Saw a man
Standing at the crossroads
With a tear on his face
There was a man
Waiting for an invention
And a moment of grace

You're gonna give that man a road
He can walk on
Give that man a road to Jesus
You're gonna give that man a road
He can walk on
Give that man a road to Jesus

There was a man
Down in the dark of the valley
With a chain on his hand
Yeah, there was a man
Meant to walk in the sunshine
Be the light of the land

You're gonna give that man a road
He can walk on
Give that man a road to Jesus
You're gonna give that man a road
He can walk on
Give that man a road to Jesus

I'm gonna push
Onward in my journey
To the promised land
I'm gonna shout
Glory to king Jesus
Upon rocks and sand

You're gonna give that man a road
He can walk on
Give that man a road to Jesus
You're gonna give that man a road
He can walk on
Give that man a road to Jesus
