I had a real good mother and father
And they surely stood the test
And now are in bright glory
And are sleeping on the Savior's breast

They set a good example for me
And they taught me how to pray
Now I truly converted
And walking on the narrow way

I know that if I cannot meet them on high
Then how lonely I will be
For what good is my journey
If I miss out on eternity

I had a real good mother and father
And they surely stood the test
And now they're in bright glory
And are sleeping on the Savior's breast
