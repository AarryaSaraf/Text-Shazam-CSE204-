Fly around my pretty little miss
Fly around my honey
Fly around my pretty little miss
I'll see you next Sunday

Higher up the cherry tree
Sweeter grow the cherries
The more you hug and kiss a girl
The sooner she will marry

Fly around my pretty little miss
Fly around my honey
Fly around my pretty little miss
I'll see you next Sunday

If I had a snow white ship
I'd sail away tomorrow
If I had a silver sail
I'd fly away from sorrow

Fly around my pretty little miss
Fly around my honey
Fly around my pretty little miss
I'll see you next Sunday

Go and get your weevily wheat
Go and get your barley
Go and get your weevily wheat
Gonna bake a cake for Charlie

Fly around my pretty little miss
Fly around my honey
Fly around my pretty little miss
I'll see you next Sunday

Coffee grows on a white oak tree
And the river flows with brandy
If I had that little girl
I'd feed her sugar candy

Fly around my pretty little miss
Fly around my honey
Fly around my pretty little miss
I'll see you next Sunday
