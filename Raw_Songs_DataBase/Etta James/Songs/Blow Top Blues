I've got bad news, baby
And you're the first to know
I've got bad news, baby
And you're the first to know
I discovered this morning that my top is about to blow

I've been rocking on my feet
And been talking all out of my head
I've been rocking on my feet
And been talking all out of my head
When I get through talking, don't remember a thing I've said

I used to be a sharpie
Always dressed in the latest styles
But now I'm walking down Broadway
Wearing nothing but a smile
I see all kinds of little men
Although they're never there
I tried to push a subway train
Poured whiskey in my hair
I'm a gal you can't excuse, I've got those blowtop blues

Last night I was five feet tall, today I'm eight feet ten
And every time I fall downstairs, I float right up again
When somebody turned the lights on me it like to drove me blind
And I woke up in Bellevue but I've left my mind behind
I'm a gal who blew a fuse, I've got those blowtop blues
