You never close your eyes anymore
When I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before
In your fingertips

You're trying hard not to show it (Baby)
But baby, baby, I know it

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Now there's no welcome look in your eyes
When I reach for you
And now you're starting to criticize
Every little thing I do

It makes me just feel like crying (Baby)
'Cause, baby, something beautiful is dying

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Baby, baby, baby I'd get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me like you used to do
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find every day
So please don't, don't, don't, don't let it slip away

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa-oh-oh-oh

You let it slip away, you let it slip away
You let it get gone, baby

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Whoa, that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa-oh-oh-oh

You let it slip away in the midnight hour one night
I remember so clearly, it was gone
(It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone)
It wasn't there anymore, it had gone
Believe what I say baby
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
