My man, my man got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
My man, my man got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
My man, my man got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby he done left, he done left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I, like I feel today
Feelin' tomorrow like I, like I feel today
I'll gonna pack my rags, make my getaway

St. Louis woman in all her diamond ring
She pulls my man around, by her apron strings
If it wasn't for powder and that store-bought hair
You know that man I love, he wouldn't have gone nowhere

I got that St. Louis blues, blue as I can be
My man got a heart like a rock down in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far away from me

My man's, my man's gone
Ooh, he done left this town
He done gone gone gone gone
He done left me, yes he has
Oh daddy, I want my man
But he done gone, he done left
He done left this town
