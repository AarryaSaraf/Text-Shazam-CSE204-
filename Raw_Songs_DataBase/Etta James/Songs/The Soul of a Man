The soul of a man touches something inside of me
Something too deep for anyone else to see
And the whole world wants to know why I love him so
But I'm afraid they just wouldn't understand

My love for a man is something I can't explain
And every tear I shed, I know it's wasted in vain
But there's something I can't reveal that I so deeply feel
Oh it must be, it's gotta be the soul of the man

I cried and I cried 'till I just can't cry no more
I know the man really don't love me but he just won't let me go
He controls my heart, my mind and my soul
And he's got the power to make me stay when I really wanna go

The soul of a man, it turns my mind around
It takes my helpless heart and turns it upside down
And the whole world wants to know why I love him so
Oh it must be, just gotta be the soul of a man

Ow, got to be, got to be, got to be the soul of a man
