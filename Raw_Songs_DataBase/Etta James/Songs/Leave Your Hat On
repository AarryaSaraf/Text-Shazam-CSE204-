Baby, take off your coat...real slow
Baby, take off your shoes...here, I'll take your shoes
Baby, take off that mess...
Heh yes, yes, yes
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
You can leave your hat on
Ow...mmm'go on over there, turn on the light...no, all the lights
Come back here, stand on this chair...heh that's right
Raise your arms up, up in the air and uh...shake 'em
You give me reason to live
You give me reason to live
You give me reason to...oh-owww
You give me reason to live
Suspicious minds are talking
Trying to tear us apart
They say that my love is wrong
They don't know what love is...
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
But I-I-I-I-I-I...I know what love is
