Drained of emotion
Tears run dry
I would give anything just to feel alright
Down on my knees praying' for help
But sometimes you just gotta help yourself

I tried so hard to be someone you would love
Seems I would never try hard hard enough
Though I love you
Gotta give you up
I'm going back to who I was
And I do believe that a change is gonna do me good

Lets take this moment
To say goodbye
Look at each other
Right straight in the eye
Don't look back baby
Cause I'll be gone
I've got my own life to carry on

I tried so hard to be someone you'd love
Seems I would never try hard enough
Though I love you
Gotta give you up
I'm going back to who I was
And I do believe that
Change is gonna do me good

I tried so hard to be someone you'd love
Seems I would never try hard enough
Though I love you
Gotta to give you up
I'm going back to who I was ahhh
I do believe
Change is gonna do me good

I do believe
Change, change is gonna do me good
Change change change is gonna do me good
