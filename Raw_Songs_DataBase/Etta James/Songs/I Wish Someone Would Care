(Oh-oh)
Oh oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, ah
Oh oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, ah

The good, the bad, the hurt
All of this goes, too
And I wish, oh, I wish
How I wish someone would care

Sitting home alone, thinkin' about my past
Wondering how I made it, and how long it's gonna last
Success has come to lots of them, and failure's always there
Time, time waits for no one, and
I wish, how I wish someone would care

(Oh-oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ah ah
(Oh-oh-oh)
Oh oh oh ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Some folks think you're happy
When you wear your smile, but
What about your tribulations, and, uh
All of your trials?
Smiles, smiles hide lots of things...

The good, the bad, the hurt
All of this goes too
And I wish, oh I wish, how I wish
How I wish someone...
Someone would care

Oh oh oh, oh oh ah ah ah
Oh oh oh, oh oh ah ah
