I worry 'bout you
When you're gone, I get blue
So, darling, take care
Oh, I worry about you

I'm home every night
Wondering if you are alright
I knew when we met
Oh, I'd worry about you

You matter to me
You matter to me
So much, so much, so much, so much
I don't know
My soul, my soul's in your hands
Wherever you go, oh, oh, oh

Whatever, whatever you do
Come on home
Come on home when you're through
You're mine, don't forget
Oh, oh, oh, I don't worry about you

Oh, oh, oh, you matter, you matter to me
You matter to me
So much, so much, so much, so much
I don't know
My soul, my soul's in your hands
Wherever you go, oh

Whatever you do, whatever you do
Come on home
Come on home when you're through, yeah
You're mine, you're mine, don't forget
Oh, I don't worry about you

Oh, I worry about you
