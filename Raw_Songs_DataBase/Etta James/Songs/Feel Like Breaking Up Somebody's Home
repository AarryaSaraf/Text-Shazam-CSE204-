Lying 'round home alone
On a rainy night like this
Starving for your love
Hungry for just one kiss

Every raindrop I hear
Against my window pane
Speaks so loud and clear, oh Lord
Spelled out your name

Got nowhere to turn, tired of being alone
Feel like breaking up somebody's home

I know it's useless hanging on
When you belong to someone else
Can't control the feeling
'Cause after all I didn't make myself

Last night I cried so hard
I believe I caught a chill
Can't stand the vibration
Oh, my heart just won't stand still

Got nowhere to turn, tired of being alone
Feel like breaking up somebody's home
Got nowhere to turn, tired of being alone
Feel like breaking up somebody's home

I know it's useless hanging on
When you belong to someone else
Can't control my feeling
'Cause after all I didn't make myself

Got nowhere to turn, tired of being alone
Feel like breaking up somebody's home
Got nowhere to turn, tired of being alone
Feel like breaking up somebody's home

Got nowhere to turn, tired of being alone
Feel like smashing up somebody's home
Feel like breaking up somebody's home
