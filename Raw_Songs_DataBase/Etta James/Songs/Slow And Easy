Now you're always rushing baby
Always in a hurry
Making lots of tracks, gettin' nowhere
And that makes me worry
Cos when you start loving me honey
Please take your time
A sixty minute man just won't do
I'm putting my case on the line

When you start loving me babe
When you start loving me babe
When you start loving me
Ooh, take it slow and easy
Slow and easy

Now when love me baby
Don't act like you're going to put out no fire
When you start working on my case
Take as much time as you require
I don't want you, no no
To be in no rush
Honey, groove me, upset me
With your loving touch

When you start loving me babe
When you start loving me babe
When you start loving me
Ooh, take it slow and easy
Slow and easy

I know love makes the world go round
And that's a real true fact
And when you love me real good honey
Oh boy, you're on the right track
Now listen, just take your time now
And do the job right
Cos when you get your thing together, baby
You have better be a little tight

When you start loving me babe
When you start loving me babe
When you start loving me
Ooh, take it slow and easy
Slow and easy

Do the job slow and easy honey
Real slow and easy, baby
Work on my case right now honey
Go on and turn me on boy
Ooh, sock it to me honey
Slow and easy, baby
Lay it on me baby, right now
Not talking 'bout tomorrow but right now, honey
Ooh baby, throw it on me
Lay it on me, sock it to me, push it to me
