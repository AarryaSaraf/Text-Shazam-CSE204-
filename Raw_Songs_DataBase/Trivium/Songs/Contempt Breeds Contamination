Mistaken identity
You really got this one wrong
Racially singled out
He must have a gun
And yet you get off with no time
How can this be the answer?
No crime yet they shot away
He now lies dead, the blood is on your hands
Hands which were supposed to protect
People like the man you blew away
This isn't justice, this is corruption

The four protectors fired 41 shots
Hitting him 19 times
Searching the body there were no weapons found
He lies with all who died in vain

Murder must still be a crime
When our inherent freedom
It's hatefully gunned down by who we entrust
And yet you get off with no time
How can this be the answer?
No crime yet they shot away
He now lies dead, the blood is on your hands
Hands which were supposed to protect
People like the man you blew away
This isn't justice, this is corruption

The four protectors fired 41 shots
Hitting him 19 times
Searching the body there were no weapons found
He lies with all who died in vain

Contempt breeds contamination
Contempt breeds contamination
Contempt breeds contamination
Contempt breeds contamination
