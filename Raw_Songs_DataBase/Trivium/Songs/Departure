This weight is so unbearable caving my lungs
All my life seems to be flashing in front of my eyes (in front of my eyes)
Run away from all the pain, All The Pain In life

Run Away! (Run Away!) From The Pain! Of Life!

Ways of devotion turn to obsession open your eyes (open Your Eyes)
I want you to see what you've done to me
crying out those eyes (crying out those eyes)
Run away from all the pain, all the pain in life

Run Away! (Run Away!) From The Pain! Of Life!
Bring my end! (bring My End!) to an end!

Distance yourself from the pain that covers me
As I reach out for your hand to find there's nothing left for me
Razors kiss the vein overdose for pain
A 12 gauge cross kisses the forehead a savior in a shell
Sever me from the fall
Fuck the people, Fuck the world, Fuck it all
Open my arms
Bleed out the flood
In crimson I begin to drown

Sever me from the fall
Fuck the people, Fuck the world, Fuck it all
Open my arms
Bleed out the flood
In crimson I begin to drown

Run Away! (Run Away!) From The Pain! Of Life!
Bring my end! (bring My End!) to an end!
Distance yourself from the pain that covers me
As I reach out for your hand to find there's nothing left for me

Distance yourself from the pain that covers me
As I reach out for your hand to find there's nothing left for me
