Every time I'm left alone
My misery begins to drown me
Tied by a rope of anxiety
Thrown overboard

As I'm pulled under the tides of this fast paced world
I refuse to see


Time will always be the thing that kills me truly
Open these eyes waking from a dream feigning

My lungs fill up with letdown
Disappointment in self and everyone
Expectations died in failure
abandonment my unsavior

As I'm pulled under the tides of this fast paced world
I refuse to see



Absolution at the sight of your demise
I know what I must do
Choke
Die choking on your every word

Swallow every blasphemy

Absolution at the sight of your demise
I know what I must do

Swallow every blasphemy
Eat out your heart and make it bleed
Tie the noose around my neck
Make this life end
