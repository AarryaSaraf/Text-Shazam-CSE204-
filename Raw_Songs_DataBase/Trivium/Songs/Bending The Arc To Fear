A strain of vigilance
Deep roots that all connect
We wait so diligent
Watching you
Watching you

(Watching you)
(Watching you)

An engine of suspicion
A web you can't escape
Crossing all lines to listen
Breaking through
Breaking through

Prey upon you
The weak inherit all our scorn
Prey upon you
The fragile bones now ripped and torn

Prey upon you
The weak inherit all our scorn
Prey upon you
The fragile bones now ripped and torn

These eyes show you
Bending the arc to fear

This heart will prove
Bending the arc to fear

These eyes show you
Bending the arc to fear

Prey upon you
The weak inherit all our scorn
Prey upon you
The fragile bones now ripped and torn

(Bending the arc to fear)

Prey upon you
Prey upon you
Prey upon you
Prey upon you
The fragile bones now ripped and torn

These eyes show you
Bending the arc to fear

This heart will prove
Bending the arc to fear
Bending the arc to fear
