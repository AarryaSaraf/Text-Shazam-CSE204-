I was so empty
Self loathing
Before you awoke me
Lived in transgression
Feasted sin
Destroying all I stood for

A world of spreading disease
Legs up for infidelity
They force feed of their stiffened sickness
The promised hiding their rings
To suck down some of the things
That cheat this world into lovelessness

All the pain in this world won't stop us now
For we have each other
All the hate in this world can't tear us apart
This love is forever

In arms we'll turn (a)way
From their ways
We live like no other
Together we're hope
Absolute
The only thing that matters

A world of spreading disease
Legs up for infidelity
They force feed of their stiffened sickness
The promises hiding their rings
To suck down some of the things
That cheat this world into lovelessness

[Solo: Matt]

All the pain in this world won't stop us now
For we have each other
All the hate in this world can't tear us apart
This love is forever

All the pain in this world won't stop us now
All the hate in this world can't tear us apart

All the pain in this world won't stop us now
For we have each other
All the hate in this world can't tear us apart
This love is forever
