Force-feed them your ways
Dictate up a blinded swarm
Society's afraid

Declaration of rebellion
We will not stand defeat
Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be tenfold


Our enemy will be drowned
The opposing torn asunder

Take all your lives back
Arson all they create
The time is now to lead the battle

Declaration of rebellion
We will not stand defeat
Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be tenfold



Deconstructing their hold
Our vengeance will be tenfold
