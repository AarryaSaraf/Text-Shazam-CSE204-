Abandonment, you've taken all I've given
There's no heaven anymore
Prepare myself for falling
I'm drowning, there is no hand to reach for me
I'm drowning, there is no hand to reach for me

So starving
No noble mind
Will feed me
Will anoint
My aching wounds

Now I'm on my knees
Petitioning your deity
No more crying and begging
No answer will be given

Broken down before a false divinity
Then I saw the lies
I know the truth at last
The truth at last

I'll rise again
No more abandonment
Stronger than ever before
Stronger than you'll
You'll ever be

I won't implore this darken sky
Never await a cure
Never await a cure

Listen to your melodies
This lie will not be lived
Listen to your melodies
This lie will not be lived

So starving
No noble mind
Will feed me
Will anoint
My aching wounds
Wounds

It's all in me
All I'll ever need
It's all in me
All I'll ever need

I'll rise again
No more abandonment
Stronger than ever before
Stronger than you'll
You'll ever be

I won't implore this darken sky
Never await a cure
Never await a cure
Await a cure
Await a cure
Await a cure
Await a cure
