If you could breakdown and put yourself together
Then would all the pieces ever fit the same
If you could see all the ways we're tied together
Would you pull apart the ugliness and shame

Gods walk amongst all
Without fear
Without tears
On a higher plane than anyone of us

Gods walk amongst all
Without fear
Without tears
Tell me now, which side do you fall

Distraught faces
Vacant homes displace them
All the time
The ones we leave behind
(The ones we leave behind)

No hope, no help
Excuses replace guilt
Patronize
The ones we leave behind
The ones we leave behind

If we could break through the structures built between us
Then would all the fault lines simply disappear
If we could fight back (fight back!) and bring ourselves together
Then our sacrifices will not be in vain (will not be in vain!)

Gods walk amongst all
Without fear
Without tears
On a higher plane than anyone of us

Gods walk amongst all
Without fear
Without tears
Tell me now, which side do you fall

Distraught faces
Vacant homes displace them
All the time
The ones we leave behind
(The ones we leave behind)

No hope, no help
Excuses replace guilt
Patronize
The ones we leave behind
The ones we leave behind

If you could breakdown (down!) and put yourself together
Then would all the pieces ever fit the same

Distraught faces
Vacant homes displace them
All the time
The ones we leave behind
(Gods walk amongst all)
(The ones we leave behind)

No hope, no help
Excuses replace guilt
Patronize
The ones we leave behind
The ones we leave behind
