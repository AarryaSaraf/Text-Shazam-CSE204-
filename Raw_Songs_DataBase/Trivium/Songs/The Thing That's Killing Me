The Devil is in the details
This story is one of betrayal

Ungrateful, unworthy
You are the undeserving
No honor, no valor
No fucking gratitude
You are the wrong that I must right

You are the thing that's killing me
You're poisoning

You are the thing that's killing me
Now I'm here to bury thee

Set fire to the empire
While growing fat off this world

Ungrateful, unworthy
You are the undeserving
No honor, no valor
No fucking gratitude
You are the wrong that I must right

You are the thing that's killing me
You're poisoning

You are the thing that's killing me
Now I'm here to bury thee

[Guitar Solo]

You are the thing that's killing me
Now I can see

You are the thing that's killing me
You're poisoning

You are the thing that's killing me
Now I'm here to bury thee.
