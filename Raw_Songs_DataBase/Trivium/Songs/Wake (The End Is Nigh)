With my hands around your throat,
that's the way I like you most.
When you're choking on the feelings rushing out.

I just want to hate,
the same way that you hate,
So that I don't feel this love no more.

Choking on the feelings rushing out,
I'm choking feelings rushing out.

Time won't open up its wings,
Let me fall from grace
And lend into the flames.

I don' want to feel this love go cold,
I don't know how you opened this light before.

Choking on the feelings rushing out,
I'm choking on the feelings rushing out!

(Wake!)
It's only getting worse,
(Wake!)
Behold this bitter curse,
(Wake!)
It's only getting worse, the end is nigh.

(Wake!)
It's only getting worse,
(Wake!)
Behold this bitter curse,
(Wake!)
It's only getting worse, the end is nigh.

Take it away, every second of pain,
Like a stake through my brain.
Existence, inhumane.

Am I awake or dreaming?
Is this the life we're breaking?
Why stay alive when dying is much easier?

(Wake!)
It's only getting worse,

Behold this bitter curse,

It's only getting worse, the end is nigh.

It's not gonna end the way you want,
The end is nigh,
It's not gonna end the way you want,
The end is nigh.

Wasted away, every second and day,
Trying to ascertain our dominion in faith.

It's not gonna end the way you want,
The end is nigh, the end is nigh!

The end is nigh 
The end is nigh 
The end is nigh 
The end is nigh 
The end is nigh
