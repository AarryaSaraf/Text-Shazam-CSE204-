Who has the means to save us from ourselves
To pull us from the vicious cycles feeding back again
Consume and feed, degenerate
We damage just to liberate
Bought and sold before we could even breathe

I feel like we're falling
A lifeline just out of our reach
I feel our collapsing
The arrogant numb to our needs

You're a catastrophe
The one who's come to devastate
Catastrophist
You stole our innocence
You're a catastrophe
The one who's come to devastate
Catastrophist
We never had a chance

How far along before we fade away
So deeply out of focus but it seems we never cared
Deflect, deny what flows inside
The poison springs internalize
Bought and sold before we could even breathe

I feel like we're falling
A lifeline just out of our reach
I feel our collapsing
The arrogant numb to our needs

You're a catastrophe
The one who's come to devastate
Catastrophist
You stole our innocence
You're a catastrophe
The one who's come to devastate
Catastrophist
We never had a chance
Never had a chance

Never had a chance

Who has the means to save us from ourselves
To pull us from the vicious cycles feeding back again, feeding back again

The bringer of our devastation
You stole our innocence
Bringer of our devastation
It's you, catastrophist

Consume and feed, degenerate
We damage just to liberate
Deflect, deny, what flows inside
The poison springs internalize

I feel like we're falling
A lifeline just out of our reach
I feel our collapsing
The arrogant numb to our needs

You're a catastrophe
The one who's come to devastate
Catastrophist
You stole our innocence
We never had a chance
You're a catastrophe
The one who's come to devastate
Catastrophist
We never had a chance
Never had a chance

Catastrophist

The bringer of our devastation
You stole our innocence
Bringer of our devastation
It's you, catastrophist
