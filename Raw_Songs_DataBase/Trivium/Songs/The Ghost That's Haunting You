Ghosts surrounding me, they're taking shape
I wake and see them standing there

What the hell (what the hell are you supposed to do)
Are you supposed to do (when the whole world is after you)
When the world (what the hell are you supposed to do)
Is coming after you (when the whole world is after you)

What have I done, what have I become
Standing six feet deep, am I the only one

Save, save yourself
It's killing me to have to say
You know this is the only way

Save, save yourself
There's nothing left to say or do
You know I'll be the ghost that's haunting you

Apparition, read me my last rites
Carry me into the grave
Grave

What the hell (what the hell are you supposed to do)
Are you supposed to do (when the whole world is after you)
When the world (what the hell are you supposed to do)
Is coming after you (when the whole world is after you)

What have I done, what have I become
Standing six feet deep, am I the only one

Save, save yourself
It's killing me to have to say
You know this is the only way

Save, save yourself
There's nothing left to say or do
You know I'll be the ghost that's haunting you

(the ghost that's haunting you)

Save, save yourself
It's killing me to have to say
You know this is the only way

Save, save yourself
There's nothing left to say or do
You know I'll be the ghost that's haunting you
