That's the sound of humanity melting away
Say goodbye it's the end of days
Fire rains down on the American dream
Watch all you love see them scream

Each will dig their own graves
And bury themselves in life's failures

It's our bombs we've masterminded lighting the skies
Hideous misfires, many die
Those who survive soon will suffocate
By the poisons we create

Each will dig their own graves
And bury themselves in life's failures

De-to-na-tion, De-to-na-tion

When civilization crumbles, man will turn
On one another, killing true

[Solo: Matt, Corey]

The darkest of time will then come to be
Through our selfish killer instinct


And now the ground we called a home
Is but a barren wasteland
The only sound drowning your cries
Is the detonation

[Solo: Corey]


It seems I'm running out of time
All good as dead just stand in line 

[Solo: Matt]


And now the ground we called a home
Is but a barren wasteland
The only sound drowning your cries
Is the detonation

[Solo: Corey]
