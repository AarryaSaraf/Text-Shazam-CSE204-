Your kingdom built on lies
Revenge I fantasize
Take me all who oppose
You thought I was disposed

You've shown your true intentions
What kind of man you are

The knifes are sharpening
A co-conspiracy

Poison is treachery
My jude is past the flame
But now you say that I

Breathe in the flames

The walls that built you up
They burn you down the same

Breathe in the flames

The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same

Your throat an open grave
Your tongue used to deceive
With that I'm sinking in
Your kind will never win

You've shown your true intentions
What kind of man you are

The knifes are sharpening
A co-conspiracy

Poison is treachery
My jude is past the flame
But now you say that I

Breathe in the flames

The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same

Breathe in the flames

The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same

Burn you down the same

Breathe in the flames

The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same

Breathe in the flames

The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same

Burn you down the same
