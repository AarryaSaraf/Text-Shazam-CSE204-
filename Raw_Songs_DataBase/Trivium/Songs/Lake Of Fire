Take fallen lamb, chained by his hand
He hath come for your life
Inside your sleep, vile images creep
Hear the screams that haunt your soul

Follow the reaper
Searching for...
Stand at the gates
Hail to thee

Lake of fire
Tell me of the souls you have drowned
Demon priest
On their knees, they are praying to you

Purge innards, little child
Binge the vile, thrashing limbs for a while
Possessed, ripped and torn, your flesh is worn
Losing control of your own

Shackled down
Burning for...
Nailed down in blood
Hail to thee

Lake of fire
Tell me of the souls you have drowned
Demon priest
On their knees, they are praying to you

Staring in the eyes of hell
Blood and bone, my holding cell
I stand forth to the dark horde
I am food for the dark lord

Lake of fire
Tell me of my soul you have drowned
Demon priest
On my knees, I am praying to you
