Shepherd is chased by the wolves
Wolves who lived by intolerance and hate
For what they couldn't understand

Blinded and vicious are the beasts
Beating and ripping at a beautiful human
Who did nothing more than be himself

Tied to the fence as they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And sadness will sear

Scarecrow is left crucified, left freezing, bleeding
Tied, and wondering why. The wolves just couldn't understand
It's the preachers, and the teachers,
Governments closed-minded creatures
Try to teach us to hate that which is different

Tied to the fences as they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And sadness will sear

It's 12:53 AM
October 12th when the scarecrow died
A victim of society's cruelty
It's 12:53 AM
October 12th when the shepherd died
The candles light will alight your departure

[Solo: Matt]

Tied to the fences as they break you
And sadness will sear
Cold is the wind that will freeze you
And sadness will sear
