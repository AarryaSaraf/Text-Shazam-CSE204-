Explicit deviance
Don't have to hide
Display their wealth of sin
Right 'fore our eyes

Complicit in ruin
Protect with lies
Defenestrate, destroy
Mock and victimize

Nothing to gain
Playing their games
Always the same
Corruption betrays

I stand in defiance of your ways
(The defiant, the defiant)
Nothing can absolve you from this hate
(The defiant, the defiant in your way)
