Corpses all hang headless and limp
Bodies with no surprises
And the blood drains down like devil's rain
We'll bathe tonight

I want your skull
I need your skull
I want your skull
I need your skull

Demon I am and face I peel
To see your skin turned inside out, 'cause,
Gotta have you on my wall
Gotta have you on my wall,

'Cause I want your skull
I need your skull
I want your skull
I need your skull

Collect the heads of little girls and put 'em on my wall
Hack the heads off little girls and put 'em on my wall

I want your skull
I need your skull 
I need your skull 
I need your skull 
I need your skull 


We are 138, we are 138, we are 138
We are 138, we are 138, we are 138
We are 138, we are 138
In the eyes of tiger

Do you think we're robot clean
Does this face look almost mean
Is it time to be an android not a man

The pleasantries are gone
We're stripped of all we were
In the eyes of tiger

We are 138, we are 138, we are 138
We are 138, we are 138, we are 138
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8
