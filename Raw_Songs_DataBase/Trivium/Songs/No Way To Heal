I tear your heart out from behind
Remorse has passed us by
You're unaffected, still unaware
Of our damage done

The shame it takes me!
The pain it breaks me!
What have I done?!
Now do I have to!
For all of time now!

I feel the ice cold dagger
Make its way between by ribs again
I stand before disaster
Defiantly alive and suffocate

I''m running on empty
I''m chasing a dead dream
I''m all out of time
Clutching the will
Only to feel
No way to heal

I tried to mend it, to build it back
But the wounds become a scar
You''re lying face down in your burning wreck
The sight won't leave my head

The shame it takes me!
The pain it breaks me!
What have I done?!
Now do I have to!
For all of time now!

I feel the ice cold dagger
Make its way between by ribs again
I stand before disaster
Defiantly alive and suffocate

I''m running on empty
I''m chasing a dead dream
I''m all out of time
Clutching the will
Only to feel
No way to heal

No way to heal!

I stand before disaster
Defiantly alive and suffocate

I''m running on empty
I''m chasing a dead dream
I''m all out of time
Clutching the will
Only to feel
No way to heal

Running on empty
Chasing a dead dream
All out of time
Clutching the will
Only to feel
No way to heal
