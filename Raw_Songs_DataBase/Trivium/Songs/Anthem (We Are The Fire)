[Solo: Matt]

Just when they thought you were through
You've burned their lies, now you're strengthened it's true
Turn your backs on your enemies
And let those motherfuckers rot in their jealousy

They
Can't stand
That the worlds up for taking and we are adamant
Hell bent
Determined to dominate everything

We are the fire
Resound the anthem

The music connects, unites us more
Our masses strengthened, an unstoppable horde
We're all now a family
Together let's show the world what we say
