All this life shrouded in a veil
Of deception in association
But now I will witness thee
With unblinded open eyes

Judas I bury you in your own blood
You only held me down from what I was suppose to be

Ascend above the ashes of the world I once knew

All this life shrouded in a veil
Of deception in association
But now I will witness thee
With unblinded open eyes

Judas I bury you in your own blood
You only held me down from what I was suppose to be

Ascend above the ashes of the world I once knew
Ascendancy is the only thing this will prove

Go

I spread the fuel with ire
Desire
To incinerate all - Behold I rise - phoenix
Phoenix

Ascend above the ashes
Ascend above it all

Ascend above the ashes
Ascend above it all

Judas I bury you in your own blood
You only held me down from what I was suppose to be
Was supposed to be

Ascend above the ashes of the world I once knew
Ascendancy is the only thing this will prove

Ascend above the ashes of the world I once knew
Ascendancy is the only thing this will prove
