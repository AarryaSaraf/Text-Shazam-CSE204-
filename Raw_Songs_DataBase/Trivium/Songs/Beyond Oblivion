These graves are cold and empty
He knew it's where we'd soon reside
The waves recede so gently
They only left the sands of time

(What have we done)
To the future we run
(What have we done)
Headlong without question
(What have we done)
Creations devised
(What have we done)
To put an end to all life

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

These shadows sleep so soundly
Appalled, he now averts his eyes
Disgraced, he felt so empty
Entrusting us with our demise

(What have we done)
To the future we run
(What have we done)
Headlong without question
(What have we done)
Creations devised
(What have we done)
To put an end to all life

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

Beyond Oblivion
Beyond Oblivion
Beyond Oblivion
Beyond Oblivion

Beyond Oblivion
Beyond Oblivion
Beyond Oblivion
Beyond Oblivion

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion
