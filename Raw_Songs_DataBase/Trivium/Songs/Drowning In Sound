Second-guess every word before I even speak
Like a drug, it dilutes with every hit you seek

Assembly line
Authenticity
Ghostwritten complicity
Who are you to tell me what to do?

I'll hold back the past
I'll tear apart the future
Just to stay alive
Just to stay alive
'Cause I'm drowning in the sound
Drowning in the sound
In my mind

Running circles once again, what do you even mean?
Dead ideas want a rival, made up your mind it seems

Overboard
What was once profound
Drama plotting, I'm underground
Who are you to tell me what to do?

I'll hold back the past
I'll tear apart the future
Just to stay alive
Just to stay alive
'Cause I'm drowning in the sound
Drowning in the sound
In my mind

Second-guess every word
Before I even speak

I'll hold back the past
I'll tear apart the future
Just to stay alive
Just to stay alive
'Cause I'm drowning in the sound
Drowning in the sound

I'll hold back the past
I'll tear apart the future
Just to stay alive
Just to stay alive
'Cause I'm drowning in the sound
Drowning in the sound
In my mind
