A mind lost within its own self
Existing to feed its hunger
Your body hollowed empty shell
Awaiting feed of the ages

Darkness will cover the mind
Casting a shade on reasoning
Immolation of the human self
Conflagration of the ego

Burn in your own hell
Life grand holding cell

Two become as one
One become a slave

Burn the eye to blind
Keeping truth from mind
Breathe in the life
Breathe in the lie

No longer are you human
Just a leech of the addiction
Loathing 'till insanity
Mental deterioration

To destroy the faith
In humanity

Life shell - shocks your empty shell
Hatred for those privileged unlike you

You think you will win
But you can't face the
System of self destruction

Life skins mind bleeding dry
Hatred for the self and the life
