// Broken One //

Defeat grips you
Life deflates you
Killed your hopes too
You won't make it through

Pick up the pieces
There is a better way
Put yourself together
Try to make a change

This world's so twisted
You can still make a change
Protect and care for all around
Stop the spread of hate

You feel like the broken one
Over and over again
You taste blood, you're through, you're done
Only you can make it end

Can't let it stay
Kills more each day
Amputate pain
Tear it all away

Pick up the pieces
There is a better way
Put yourself together
Try to make a change

This world's so twisted
You can still make a change
Protect and care for all around
Stop the spread of hate

You feel like the broken one
Over and over again
You taste blood, you're through, you're done
Only you can make it end (Over and over again...)

Pick up the pieces
There is a better way
Put yourself together
Try to make a change

This world's so twisted
You can still make a change
Protect and care for all around
Stop the spread of hate

You feel like the broken one
Over and over again
You taste blood, you're through, you're done
Only you can make it end
You feel like the broken one
Over and over again (Over and over again...)
You taste blood, you're through, you're done
Only you can make it end (Over and over again, Over and over again...)

// Coração Não Tem Idade (Vou Beijar) //

Solta-te, liberta-Te
Abre as asas do sonho
Tens todo o futuro
Para saborear

Solta- te, liberta- te
Não há nada melhor
Depois de um pesadelo poder acordar

Vou beijar, vou dançar
Vou hum hum até me cansar
Toda a noite, toda a noite

Vou beijar, vou cantar
Vou hum hum até me cansar
Toda a noite, toda a noite

Quando te perguntam
Se estás cansada
Se ainda te sentes apaixonada
Toda a gente sabe
É uma verdade
Coração que ama não tem idade
Por isso vem, sabe bem
Formigueiro que a gente tem
A fluir faz sentir um calor no corpo a subir
E esta noiteeee

Vou beijar, vou cantar
Vou hum hum até me cansar
Toda a noite, toda a noite

Vou beijar, vou cantar
Vou hum hum até me cansar
Toda a noite, toda a noite

Não tenhas vergonha
E saí sozinha
Esta noite tu vais ser a rainha
Põe um salto alto e um sorriso
É desse teu jeito que eu preciso
Por isso vem, sabe bem
Formigueiro que a gente tem
A fluir faz sentir um calor no corpo a subir
E esta noiteeee

Vou beijar, vou dançar
Vou hum hum até me cansar
Toda a noite, toda a noite

Vou beijar, vou cantar
Vou hum hum até me cansar
Toda a noite, toda a noite

Ouh uouh
Ohohoh
Ohohoh
Ohohoh
Ohohohoo

Mas eu não sei se tu pões no face
Aquelas fotos que tu tiras
Em figuras muito giras
E partilhas as maravilhas
Porque afinal és como eu
E o limite é o mesmo céu
Fazer o quêeee

Vou beijar, vou dançar
Vou hum hum até me cansar
Toda a noite, toda a noite

Vou beijar, vou cantar
Vou hum hum até me cansar
Toda a noite, toda a noite

Ouh uouh
Ohohoh
Ohohoh
Ohohoh
Ohohoh
Ohohoh
Ohohoh
Ohohoh
Ohohoh

// Drowning In Sound //

Second-guess every word before I even speak
Like a drug, it dilutes with every hit you seek

Assembly line
Authenticity
Ghostwritten complicity
Who are you to tell me what to do?

I'll hold back the past
I'll tear apart the future
Just to stay alive
Just to stay alive
'Cause I'm drowning in the sound
Drowning in the sound
In my mind

Running circles once again, what do you even mean?
Dead ideas want a rival, made up your mind it seems

Overboard
What was once profound
Drama plotting, I'm underground
Who are you to tell me what to do?

I'll hold back the past
I'll tear apart the future
Just to stay alive
Just to stay alive
'Cause I'm drowning in the sound
Drowning in the sound
In my mind

Second-guess every word
Before I even speak

I'll hold back the past
I'll tear apart the future
Just to stay alive
Just to stay alive
'Cause I'm drowning in the sound
Drowning in the sound

I'll hold back the past
I'll tear apart the future
Just to stay alive
Just to stay alive
'Cause I'm drowning in the sound
Drowning in the sound
In my mind

// Fugue //

As I stand at the edge of existence
Nameless shores of infinity
Perpetual unbirth unraveling distance
Clandestine truths unveiled

Inborn imperfections preprogrammed shells
Spawning from the maelstrom 
Mechanical drones feeding from thy mother
God machine reproduce

Untruth is this my fate
Coerced my life laid to waste

Untruth is this my fate
Coerced my life laid to waste
All hail execution

As this dream comes to its grim end
Blind pray to God to make them men
As all hopes crumble truths unveiled
The world we know's an abysmal hell

Disturbed state of consciousness
Incessant black madness
Gyroscopic trance encompassing coma 
End me of this nightmare

// I Don't Wanna Be Me //

I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be
Me anymore

Ever throwing at his home
Two glass houses, twenty stones
Fourteen yellow, six are blue
Could it be worse? Quite doubtful

I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be
Me anymore

I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be
Me anymore

One, two
One, two, three, four

Two steps forward, three steps back
Without warning, heart attack
He fell asleep in the snow
Never woke up, died alone

I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be
Me anymore

I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be
Me anymore

One, two
One, two, three, four

Please don't dress in black
When you're at his wake
Don't go there to mourn
But to celebrate

Please don't dress in black
When you're at his wake
Don't go there to mourn
But to celebrate

I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be
Me anymore

I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be
Me anymore

One, two
One, two, three, four

I don't wanna be (I don't wanna be)
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be (I don't wanna be)
Me anymore

I don't wanna be (I don't wanna be)
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be (I don't wanna be)
Me anymore

// Implore The Darken Sky //

Abandonment, you've taken all I've given
There's no heaven anymore
Prepare myself for falling
I'm drowning, there is no hand to reach for me
I'm drowning, there is no hand to reach for me

So starving
No noble mind
Will feed me
Will anoint
My aching wounds

Now I'm on my knees
Petitioning your deity
No more crying and begging
No answer will be given

Broken down before a false divinity
Then I saw the lies
I know the truth at last
The truth at last

I'll rise again
No more abandonment
Stronger than ever before
Stronger than you'll
You'll ever be

I won't implore this darken sky
Never await a cure
Never await a cure

Listen to your melodies
This lie will not be lived
Listen to your melodies
This lie will not be lived

So starving
No noble mind
Will feed me
Will anoint
My aching wounds
Wounds

It's all in me
All I'll ever need
It's all in me
All I'll ever need

I'll rise again
No more abandonment
Stronger than ever before
Stronger than you'll
You'll ever be

I won't implore this darken sky
Never await a cure
Never await a cure
Await a cure
Await a cure
Await a cure
Await a cure

// Kill The Poor //

Efficiency and progress is ours once more
Now that we have the Neutron bomb
It's nice and quick and clean and gets things done
Away with excess enemy
But no less value to property
No sense in war but perfect sense at home

The sun beams down on a brand new day
No more welfare tax to pay
Unsightly slums gone up in a flashing light
Jobless millions whisked away
At last we'll have more room to play
All systems go to kill the poor tonight

Gonna kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Tonight

Behold the sparkle of champagne
The crime rate's gone, feel free again
Oh, life's a breeze with you, Miss Lily White
Jane Fonda on the screen today
Convinced the liberals it's okay
So let's get dressed and dance away the night

While they kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Tonight

Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Tonight

Behold the sparkle of champagne
The crime rate's gone, feel free again
Oh, life's a breeze with you, Miss Lily White
Jane Fonda on the screen today
Convinced the liberals it's okay
So let's get dressed and dance away the night

While they kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Tonight

Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Tonight

Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Tonight

// Losing My Religion //

Life is bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much
I said enough

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper
Of every waking hour I'm
Choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much
I said enough

Consider this
Consider this
The hint of the century
Consider this
The slip that brought me
To my knees failed
What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around
Now I've said too much
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try?
That was just a dream
Just a dream, just a dream
Dream

// Vengeance //

I will drown you in your legacy
Pulling you under, the black waves you've created
In the moonlight you're fighting for silver luster
Perhaps you could call this your baptism

Did you tell them it would bring them closer to God?
So that's how you can call this your baptism

I'll be the servant who drives purity through the heart
And there's a filter you need, so our sin is all we bring
I'll be the torch to burn it all right down into the ground
And there's a filter you need, so our sin is all we bring

Heaven will never be a sight for you
What goes on in your crazed mind? Mad man clairvoyant
You were supposed to provide guidance, protection
But it was violation you bestowed

Did you tell them it would bring them closer to God?
So that's how you can call this your baptism

I'll be the servant who drives purity through the heart
And there's a filter you need, so our sin is all we bring
I'll be the torch to burn it all right down into the ground
And there's a filter you need, so our sin is all we bring

Held down
Force-fucked
Raped of innocence
Shattering... the cradle
In the name of GOD

[Solo]

I'll be the servant who drives purity through the heart
And there's a filter you need, so our sin is all we bring
I'll be the torch to burn it all right down into the ground
And there's a filter you need, so our sin is all we bring

Pound the nails through with teeth and skin
I'll leave you to die choking on your blood
CHOKING ON YOUR BLOOD!
