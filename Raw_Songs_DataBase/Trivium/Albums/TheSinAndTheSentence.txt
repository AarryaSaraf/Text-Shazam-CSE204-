Album: TheSinAndTheSentence

// The Sin And The Sentence //

I heard the passing bells calling out my name
I knew I'd never see another day
I couldn't swim against the tides of blame
I knew there was no other way

You better practice your lines
You better practice your words
I know that real monsters lie
Between the light and the shade
It doesn't matter what you say or feel
When honest men become deranged
They'll genuflect to a lie

The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
(To a lie)
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
(They'll genuflect to a lie)
The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
(To a lie)
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
(They'll genuflect to a lie)

I saw the dagger eyes staring back at me
I knew I'd never have a chance to plead
Guilty, but in the sight of fallen men
They bury you before you speak
(The sin and the sentence)

You better practice your lines
You better practice your words
I know that real monsters lie
Between the light and the shade
It doesn't matter what you say or feel
When honest men become deranged
They'll genuflect to a lie

The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
(To a lie)
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
(They'll genuflect to a lie)
The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
(To a lie)
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
(They'll genuflect to a lie)

Beware those who speak in tongues
For they may call your name
You condemn me
'Cause you don't understand me
You condemn me
'Cause you don't understand me

They'll genuflect to a lie

The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
(To a lie)
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
(They'll genuflect to a lie)
The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
(To a lie)
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat
(They'll genuflect to a lie)

Beware those who speak in tongues
For they may call your name
You condemn me
'Cause you don't understand me
You condemn me
'Cause you don't understand me
You condemn me
'Cause you don't understand me
You condemn me
'Cause you don't understand me

Fuck!

The sin and the sentence
Penance in the fire
The sin and the sentence
The flames grip your throat

// Beyond Oblivion //

These graves are cold and empty
He knew it's where we'd soon reside
The waves recede so gently
They only left the sands of time

(What have we done)
To the future we run
(What have we done)
Headlong without question
(What have we done)
Creations devised
(What have we done)
To put an end to all life

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

These shadows sleep so soundly
Appalled, he now averts his eyes
Disgraced, he felt so empty
Entrusting us with our demise

(What have we done)
To the future we run
(What have we done)
Headlong without question
(What have we done)
Creations devised
(What have we done)
To put an end to all life

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

Beyond Oblivion
Beyond Oblivion
Beyond Oblivion
Beyond Oblivion

Beyond Oblivion
Beyond Oblivion
Beyond Oblivion
Beyond Oblivion

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

A dead road
A dark sun
Now waits
Beyond Oblivion

// Other Worlds //

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
No other

Is there hope
To break through
All the walls
Built around you

You're like a song within a nightmare
A thought within a scream

Dim the world
A glassy stare
Face to face now

Do you even care
To try to understand
Where we went wrong
Or how it seems

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

Broken mast
Shipwrecked mind
Future sinks
By design

You're like a song within a nightmare
A thought within a scream

Lost our minds
Lost our way
Face to face now

Do you even care
To try to understand
Where we went wrong
Or how it seems

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

Someone wake me from this nightmare
I can't even tell what's real

Someone wake me from this nightmare
I can't even tell what's real

We're dreaming in color
But we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

We're dreaming in color
But we're living in other worlds
We lost our way in the other worlds

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

// The Heart From Your Hate //

What will it take
What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate

It's easy to be right
When everything repeats
It's easier to cut us down and point at our defeat
It's easy to be right
When everything repeats
Dig below the surface, find your insecurities

Tell me
Maybe you were right
Maybe I was wrong
But I've been silent for far too long
Maybe you were right
Maybe I should go
But I've been silent for far too long

What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate
What will it take
What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate
(Hate)
To rip the heart from your hate
(Hate)
To rip the heart from your hate

You always walk away
Soon you'll have to face it
Your distance from reality won't bury or erase it
I tried to do the same
Living so complacent
But the problems wouldn't go away so I turned around to face them

Tell me
Maybe you were right
Maybe I was wrong
But I've been silent for far too long
Maybe you were right
Maybe I should go
But I've been silent for far too long

What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate
What will it take
What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate
(Hate)

Maybe you were right
Maybe I was wrong
But I've been silent for far too long

What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate
What will it take
What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate
What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate
What will it take
What will it take
To rip the heart from your hate
(Hate)
To rip the heart from your hate
(Hate)
To rip the heart from your hate

// Betrayer //

Betrayer
Betrayer

I say betrayer
I swear I've given you so much
Naysayer
I watched as you just lapped it up
Unwilling
Addicted to be without dignity
A cheater
You thrive on lechery

I don't know what I expected
Was our time even real
Your callous heart never seemed affected
Does a liar even know how to feel

Unto you I proclaim
Creonte shall be your name

I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim
Betrayer
(Betrayer)
Betrayer
(Betrayer)

Betrayer
Betrayer

You're calculating
I know you know exactly what you're doing
Your selfishness your only cause

A fake, a farce
You had us all convinced
No guilt, no heart
No love, no conscience held

What do you want from me
Creonte shall be your name

I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim
Betrayer
(Betrayer)
Betrayer
(Betrayer)

Time will not mend
All these mistakes have now brought forth the end
For you, my friend

Time will not mend
All these mistakes have now brought forth the end
For you, my friend
I say betrayer

A fake, a farce
You had us all convinced
No guilt, no heart
No love, no conscience held

What do you want from me
Creonte shall be your name

I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim
Betrayer

// The Wretchedness Inside //

Submerged in dirt but it was never enough
To quell the fire in the back of my lungs
My bones are aching and my head is a mess
They said to run but I'm obsessed with the madness

This blood I bleed, I bleed for you
I paint the walls with my misery
This blood I bleed, I bleed for me
I can not live if I can't breathe

The part I can't control, I can't destroy
The wretchedness inside

The wretchedness inside of you
(Inside)
The wretchedness inside of me

Consigned to hurt but it was never enough
To bury feelings that will surely return
My heart is aching, and my god I'm a mess
I'll never run cause I'm obsessed with the madness

This blood I bleed, I bleed for you
I paint the walls with my misery
This blood I bleed, I bleed for me
I can not live if I can't breathe

The part I can't control, I can't destroy
The wretchedness inside

The wretchedness inside of you
(Inside)
The wretchedness inside of me

I cannot control I cannot destroy
In hell, can I confide

The wretchedness inside of you
(In hell, can I confide)
The wretchedness inside of me

How did it come to this
How the fuck did it come to this
Our love and hate collide in all this dissonance

How did it come to this
How the fuck did it come to this
Our love and hate collide in all this dissonance

Fuck you

How did it come to this
How the fuck did it come to this
Our love and hate collide in all this dissonance

How did it come to this
How the fuck did it come to this
Our love and hate collide in all this dissonance

This blood I bleed, I bleed for you
I paint the walls with my misery
This blood I bleed, I bleed for me
I can not live if I can't breathe

The part I can't control, I can't destroy
The wretchedness inside

The wretchedness inside of you
(Inside)
The wretchedness inside of me

I cannot control I cannot destroy
In hell, can I confide

The wretchedness inside of you
(In hell, can I confide)
The wretchedness inside of me
