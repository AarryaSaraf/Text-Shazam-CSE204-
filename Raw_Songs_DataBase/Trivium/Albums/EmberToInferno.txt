// Pillars Of Serpents //

"I'm alive!"
"I'm alive!"
Final words of a god left drowning
Burned alive
Burned alive
Scorch the angels out from the skies

Building up the walls to surround us in
From a world built on sin
Building up the strength for the release
From a world corrupted

To be unseen
With the eyes
For it's the ground that we lie on
Open wide
Open mind
Nail your mouths shut, it's this world

Building up the walls to surround us in
From a world built on sin
Building up the strength for the release
From a world corrupted, corrupted

Wasting lives away
Consume to filling

Only waking
For the feeding

Give me spark to light the world
Up in flames reignite
A changing to better times
End this now

Pillars, serpents
Make it over

Give me spark to light the world
Up in flames reignite
A changing to better times
End this now

So no more are these dreams of angels
Washed away with the tears
So no more are these dreams of angels
Washed away with the tears

Pillars, serpents
Make it over

// If I Could Collapse The Masses //

In time you'll realize
That life is but a mold
To be one with the seas
Is to fly on broken wings
Craft it to how you see fit
Recognize powers you hold
To be one with the seas
Is to fly on broken wings
I swear by the blood I have shed

In this battle I still stand opposing
Burning away conformity's shackles
To rely on the hand that still feeds you
Suffocates all that you could have been
To achieve the victory
Is to set yourselves free
To be one with the seas
Is to fly on broken wings
I swear by the blood I have shed

Burning Burning
Faster Faster
Are your revolutionists
If I could collapse the masses
We'd be free to grow our wings
In time you'll realize
That life is but a mold
To be one with the seas
Is to fly on broken wings
I swear by the blood I have shed

To set yourself free

// Fugue (A Revelation) //

As I stand at the edge of existence
Nameless shores of infinity
Perpetual unbirth unraveling distance
Clandestine truths unveiled
Inborn imperfections preprogrammed shells
Spawning from the maelstrom
Mechanical drones feeding from thy mother
God machine reproduce
Untruth is this my fate
Coerced my life laid to waste
Untruth is this my fate
Coerced my life laid to waste
All hail execution

As this dream comes to its grim end
Blind pray to God to make them men
As all hopes crumble truths unveiled
The world we know's an abysmal hell
Disturbed state of consciousness
Incessant black madness
Perpetual un-birth unraveling distance
Clandestine truths unveiled
Untruth is this my fate
Coerced my life laid to waste
Untruth is this my fate
Coerced my life laid to waste
All hail execution

Untruth is this my fate
Coerced my life laid to waste
Untruth is this my fate
Coerced my life laid to waste
All hail execution

// Requiem //

How can you just stand there and stare?
The world burns alight the air
Fire of passion ignite
Open yourselves to fight

To reignite
The will
Deafening call
To kill

The structure of
Archetype
Abhorrence

To collapse all I've learned
To absorb with open eyes to see this

Revelation new serenity
Destruction disharmony

To see this
I'll wait for you
To rise from this dream
I will be waiting for you
To rise from this

Gazing at twilight's end
Arms raised chant extol

The structure of
Archetype
Abhorrence

To collapse all I've learned
To absorb with open eyes to see this

Revelation new serenity
Destruction disharmony

To see this
I'll wait for you
To rise from this dream
I will be waiting for you
To rise from this dream

If our world ended today would you suffer
Or just sit there awaiting damnation

How can you just stand there and stare?
The world burns alight the air

The structure of
Archetype
Abhorrence

To collapse all I've learned
To absorb with open eyes to see this

Revelation new serenity
Destruction disharmony

To see this
I'll wait for you
To rise from this dream
I will be waiting for you
To rise from this dream

// Ember To Inferno //

In birth just an ember a spark of creation
Towards genesis
With vision of dominion and godliness
With vision godliness
It will take all you have held
In evolutions design it will burn up
All obstacles
Changing opposition to a carnal ash
With vision godliness
It will take all you have held
Sacred
With vision godliness

Stay here till the windows stop burning for your dreams
Till the windows stop burning for your
From ember to inferno
From ember to inferno
In birth just an ember a spark of creation
Towards genesis
With vision of dominion and godliness
With vision godliness
It will take all you have held
Sacred
With vision godliness

Sacred
In evolutions design it will burn up
All obstacles
Changing opposition to a carnal ash
With vision godliness
It will take all you have held
Sacred
With vision godliness

// To Burn The Eye //

A mind lost within its own self
Existing to feed its hunger
Your body hollowed empty shell
Awaiting feed of the ages

Darkness will cover the mind
Casting a shade on reasoning
Immolation of the human self
Conflagration of the ego

Burn in your own hell
Life grand holding cell

Two become as one
One become a slave

Burn the eye to blind
Keeping truth from mind
Breathe in the life
Breathe in the lie

No longer are you human
Just a leech of the addiction
Loathing 'till insanity
Mental deterioration

To destroy the faith
In humanity

Life shell - shocks your empty shell
Hatred for those privileged unlike you

You think you will win
But you can't face the
System of self destruction

Life skins mind bleeding dry
Hatred for the self and the life

// Falling To Grey //

In this day aspirations star decayed
It was the light of our desires
A fire burns in the mind
Torching once fundamental truths
Downfall
Self loathing it's your state of mind
Drowning in dejection
Homicidal of your talents
It's mental suicide
Downfall
One by one they all drown
Down the path I can't hear

To feel this pain with you
To feel this pain with you
To feel this pain I'm falling to grey
To feel this pain with you
Buried dreams will withered dried
Sorrow is your guide
You haven't the will to carry on
You'll feel better when you're gone
Downfall
One by one they all drown
Down the path I can't hear

If I may realign the scriptures
For fallacy's decay
Reclamation of the spirit
First step in taking back your life
Downfall
One by one they all drown
Down the path I can't hear

// My Hatred //

So you think you've won
Come take a walk inside
This enraged pissed off mind
It's calling for you

Feel Feel My Hatred
It bleeds down
On your faith

Lusted for so long
For the moment
Lying broken in a corner
Here it comes

Feel Feel your ending
It's so grim and cold here

How can this be for real?
I thought I already killed you

Ancient and immortalized
Will be my hate forever
For your kind
Human kind

// When All Light Dies //

In this chasm lying broken
Is a child charred inside
No more is there any hope
Shattered bones bloodied scars
Deliver me towards the soil
Close up the sun grant me rest
In worms coil
It's so beautiful
World outside of this cell
With a somber gaze
I take in what will never be

Prayed to be free
Broken on my knees
God won't appear
When all light dies
It's my only wish to die
Free myself from your reign of terror
So many times swear I died
Why won't the blood loss kill me
Deliver me towards the soil
Close up the sun grant me rest
In worms coil
It's so beautiful
World outside of this cell
With a somber gaze
I take in what will never be

Make me swear if I see your face again
I'd make you pay for the years of abuse
Fuck you
Tie you up make you bleed tear you apart
Limb from limb so many years I've held this in
I want to take your life
Make me swear if I see your face again
Tie you up make you bleed
Just like me

// Demon //

Pull the blood upon your face
Grip dementia
I am now enslaved through hate
Suffer my fate decide

Decide

Shot in their blackened tombs
Death burning my eyes
Invert birth great fiery womb
Time to ever die

Die
Feeling death consuming
Deaths head all around me

Feel death round
Feel death bound

Demons scream and pull me in
Look behold the flesh
Kingdom built of rotting skin
Enter gates of hell

Feel life die
Feel you die

// The Storm //

Out from the darkness my future is here
A frigid cold grips my veins
Foretold through ages beckoning fear
My nightmares finally here

Time has now come look to the sun
A grand failure
The sky crumbles heaven follows
The end is here

Out from the endless hell frozen forest
I hear the ear piercing screams
Grey empty skies fill with black cancer
The beasts are coming for me

As I stand paralyzed consumed frozen by my fear
Sun falls reignite the end
The end

Now that it's over done with and gone
I reach cursing the sun
Blood thirsty warlords take to the sky
Icy plains graves here I die

As the pain rises up again
I question even being human
Absurd evil seared into mine eyes
Its here I forever die
Die

// Sworn //

Sworn to fight evils of night
Clad in black legions attack

Storming castle stealing life
Retribution fill my veins
Nothing left but fire

This is the end of life
So say your prayers
This is the end of life
So say your prayers

(Prayers) can't take the pain away
Dressed in night hope angels still prey
