// Kirisute Gomen //

He who walks the fire breathes!

He who walks the fire breathes
Unlike the rest
Living by the bloody creed
Kirisute gomen
Air of battle tasting stale
Reeks of deceit
Send the bitter straight to hell
Kirisute gomen

In their wretched guts all they want is to feed
Unending, covetous hunger known as greed
As the last legion makes it's way to the skies

I can see in their eyes
They've already died
Inside, but as for the outside
I'll take their fucking heads

Quake has bred with the storm
Conceiving war
Wicked stampeding hordes
Kirisute gomen

In their wretched guts all they want is to feed
Unending, covetous hunger known as greed
As the last legion makes it's way to the skies

I can see in their eyes
They've already died
Inside, but as for the outside
I'll take their fucking heads [x2]

[Chorus:]
I will never be what they
Want me to
I live by my own path in life
No turning
Back now, I won't be held down
Forced into a shallow grave built upon their empty ways
There's no turning back

There's hell to pay, such disarray
A bloodied mess, flesh masquerade
With all the blood making a flood
You made your path by crossing us

He who spits the fire seethes
All he detests
Decapitating, bloody creed
Kirisute gomen

In their wretched guts all they want is to feed
Unending, covetous hunger known as greed
As the last legion makes it's way to the skies

I can see in their eyes
They've already died
Inside, but as for the outside
I'll take their fucking heads [x2]

[Chorus]

I will never be what they
Want me to
I live by my own path in life
There's no turning back

// Torn Between Scylla And Charybdis //

Within struggle, amidst horror
Inside conflict, visceral war
Make a stand here, vanquish all fear
Don't hesitate, eradicate

Torn between Scylla and Charybdis
Feel the fear ripening, go taste it
Torn between Scylla and Charybdis
Feast fruits of valor, if you face it

Walls of carnage surround your weakness
Crash down like oceans, wait for the light
In total darkness, drowning in bleakness
Awaiting death's grip, cry out for life

Divided by destiny
Torn between death and doom
Destruction by decision
Fate shows me my open tomb

Apprehension runs down your chin
Masticate it, suck those tears in
Life's a battle, perpetual crusade
One against all, time to wield the blade

Torn between Scylla and Charybdis
Feel the fear ripening, go taste it
Torn between Scylla and Charybdis
Feast fruits of valor, if you face it

In total darkness, drowning in bleakness
Awaiting death's grip, cry out for life

Divided by destiny
Torn between death and doom
Destruction by decision
Fate shows me my open tomb
A fight that tests the substance
Of all that you call your life
Destruction by decision
Fate shows me my open tomb

[solo: CKB]

Face down that which makes you bleed
Turn it 'round and force your seed
Down

[solo: PFG]
[solo: MKH]

Face down that which makes you bleed
Turn it 'round and force your seed
Down

[solo: PFG]

Torn between Scylla and Charybdis
Feast fruits of valor, if you face it

Walls of carnage surround your weakness
Crash down like oceans, wait for the light
In total darkness, drowning in bleakness
Awaiting death's grip, cry out for life

Divided by destiny
Torn between death and doom
Destruction by decision
Fate shows me my open tomb
A fight that tests the substance
Of all that you call your life
Destruction by decision
Fate shows me my open tomb

// Down From The Sky //

A chasm grows
In the cavity of serpentine teeth
Hunger pains strike
For the sweet feast of innocent blood
Of innocent bloodshed
Now here we go

The vampires feed on the wars of mankind
The vampires feed on the wars of mankind

Growing fat on the throne of an empire
Tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire

I've opened up my eyes
Seen the world for what it's worth
Tears rain down from the sky
They'll blow it all to bits
To prove whose god wields all the power
Fire rains down from the sky

The gaping wounds
Hemorrhaging the blood from which they feast
Eat us alive
Consume to feed a hunger with no
A hunger with no end
Let's fucking go

The vampires feed on the wars of mankind
The vampires feed on the wars of mankind

Growing fat on the throne of an empire
Tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire

I've opened up my eyes
Seen the world for what it's worth
Tears rain down from the sky
They'll blow it all to bits
To prove whose god wields all the power
Fire rains down from the sky

This battle's not the same which they have led us to believe
A synthesis of propaganda, terror and deceit
We are the cattle; they the slaughter; our meat: gasoline

They pump us through the machine's valves to cleanse the world's "disease"
We are the ammunition that will cause all life to cease

Annihilate
All those who stand in their way
Obliterate
They'll rain their holocaust down from the sky

The vampires feed on the wars of mankind
The vampires feed on the wars of mankind

Growing fat on the throne of an empire
Tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire

I've opened up my eyes
Seen the world for what it's worth
Tears rain down from the sky
They'll blow it all to bits
To prove whose god wields all the power
Fire rains down from the sky

Annihilate

All those who stand in their way
Obliterate
They'll rain their holocaust down from the sky

// Into The Mouth Of Hell We March //

Can't you see, it's not only me
That feels we're linked to the seas
Make your way to a massive grave
If you can't fight for each day

Torrential rain at the helm of death
It drowns the weak, battering the rest
Black walls of waves pummel to capsize
The roaring thunder overshadows our cries
Spires of lightning thrown down from the gods
Melting skin even in the deluge
The mast is broken, hull is splitting
Dear god the fucking ship is sinking

I will try to pour all of myself into this life
Before I die

Such turmoil, let's make the blood boil
Make your time count or rot as the soil
Life is hard, a fucking battle
The time is now and here's your drum roll

Torrential rain at the helm of death
It drowns the weak, battering the rest
Black walls of waves pummel to capsize
The roaring thunder overshadows our cries
Spires of lightning thrown down from the gods
Melting skin even in the deluge
The mast is broken, hull is splitting
Dear god the fucking ship is sinking

I will try to pour all of myself into this life
Before I die
If I go before my time
Then take these words evermore into your life

We crawl out from the wreckage
Fingers dig into the sands
Of the shores
Everything we worked for
Is ripped apart and ruined, drowned
Deep beneath our dying world
The earth begins to open up

Into the mouth of hell we march
(Into the mouth of hell)
Into the mouth of hell we march
Into the mouth of hell we march
(Into the mouth of hell)
Into the mouth of hell we march

Now you see, for it is we
Who walk the fire and breathe
Make our way out of the grave
And lick the blood from our blades

Spires of lightning thrown down from the gods
Melting skin even in the deluge
The mast is broken, hull is splitting
Dear god the fucking ship is sinking

I will try to pour all of myself into this life
Before I die
If I go before my time
Then take these words evermore into your life [x2]

// Throes Of Perdition //

Blind-folded and gagged, stood waiting
With the whole world: my firing squad
At the edge of the world I'm faced out
Staring the sun right in the eye

Vultures circle above, hyenas mocking the kill
Excrement drooling down their chins
Atop the cliffs I look down, into the starving Hell-mouth
The rabid foam crashes hard on its teeth

Their mouth's salivate
Fantasizing my gruesome ending
This world looks down upon
A man who can stand on his own two feet

As they're feeding their guns: "Ready, aim"
They say I'll live, if I die for their cause
Living under the rule of fellow Cro-Magnon fool
They fear who leads and will kill to stay still

Their mouth's salivate
Fantasizing my gruesome ending
This world looks down upon
A man who can stand on his own two feet
Without eating from their claws

Life feels like Hell should
But this Hell's so cold
Pull another knife out
Stick it with the rest of them
When my back is full
Turn me around to face it

Life feels like Hell should
But this Hell's so cold
Pull another knife out
Stick it with the rest of them
When my back is full
Turn me around to face it

Such melancholy, burning the stars from skies
As we melt, drowning inside their bloodied eyes
Hope is ravaged, running from lacerations
Sob so heavily, we choke, then we die

[solo: CKB]
[solo: MKH]

Die

Life feels like Hell should
But this Hell's so cold
Pull another knife out
Stick it with the rest of them
When my back is full
Turn me around to face it [4x]

Go

Sob so heavily, we choke, then we die

// Insurrection //

Bow not before his creation
These mortals: "man"
This act of insult
Breeds our discontent
He turned his back
On our loyalty
I will bring my insurrection
And a war upon heaven

I will bring my insurrection
And a war upon heaven
Hell-fire be my destruction
For this war upon heaven

Forged from fire
I declare this war
A war against Heaven
I bring upon my scourge
Filled with hubris
A declaration of war

It is I who spawns this fury
Torches: ignite
Blaze is set to engulf all of which we hate
Storm in, eviscerate
Every motherfucker in our way
I will bring my insurrection
And a war upon heaven

I will bring my insurrection
And a war upon heaven
Hell-fire be my destruction
For this war upon heaven

Forged from fire
I declare this war
A war against Heaven
I bring upon my scourge
Filled with hubris
A declaration of war

Ascend to the heavens
To destroy them all

[solo: CKB]
[solo: MKH]

Forged from fire
I declare this war
A war against Heaven
I bring upon my scourge
Filled with hubris
A declaration of war

// The Calamity //

You cannot be, you're the mistake: calamity
Sent to destroy all of the good
on this Earth, killing me
You're killing me

The mother of ruination comes to fuck all
Mutilating everything, spread wide open, beckoning
Beckoning me

Spiral faster down
Ripping a hole through the air we breathe
An apocalypse
Encased in a shell, so beautiful

The calamity makes its way to the inside
I know we are feeling the same thing
The calamity makes its way to the inside
To eat away at our existence

Spewed from the wound of this life's worst cavity; the
Nightmare spreads it's cancerous lamentations, poisoning
Force-feed the plague

Drunk from the milk of death's overflowing sick tit
Nourishing the misery, gives birth to the ugliness
That grows inside

Spiral faster down
Ripping a hole through the air we breathe
An apocalypse
Encased in a shell, so beautiful

The calamity makes its way to the inside
I know we are feeling the same thing
The calamity makes its way to the inside
To eat away at our existence

Isolate
The heart from the brain
Permeate
Inject us with pain

Holding our breath now
We're screaming without sound
We're trembling as everything falls completely apart
Meteor crash down
Come crater our woe out
The banishment of everything once alive will start now

[solo: MKH]
[solo: CKB]

Holding our breath now
We're screaming without sound
The banishment of everything once alive will start now

You came to be, you're the mistake: calamity
Here to destroy all of the good on this Earth, killing all
Killing us all

Spiral faster down
Ripping a hole through the air we breathe
An apocalypse
Encased in a shell, so beautiful

The calamity makes its way to the inside
I know we are feeling the same thing
The calamity makes its way to the inside
To eat away at our existence

// He Who Spawned The Furies //

The afterbirth has barely dried
When the king of ruling time
Comes with a sickle in his hand
To devour

Devour
Descendant of chaos
Devour
Castrated the father
Devour
Fearing his overthrow
Devour
Swallowed his children whole

Take your teeth out of me
I have just begun to breathe on my own
I don't know what this is
These eyes can hardly see what is eating me

The prisoners rotting in their cells
Children of this godless hell
Digesting in acidic blood
The devoured

Devour
Descendant of chaos
Devour
Castrated the father
Devour
Fearing his overthrow
Devour
Swallowed his children whole

Take your teeth out of me
I have just begun to breathe on my own
I don't know what this is
These eyes can hardly see what is eating me

He who spawned the furies
Severed the genitals of his father
Creating such beauty: the goddess of love
But the blood that fell to the ground
Made the erinyes

[solo: MKH]

He who spawned the furies

[solo: CKB]

Wreathed with serpents
Eyes dripping blood
Winged tormentors of criminals

Take your teeth out of me
I have just begun to breathe on my own
I don't know what this is
These eyes can hardly see what is eating me

// Of Prometheus And The Crucifix //

I am the Promethean
Tragic figure in this dream
Dream known as life
I bring spark into the lives
Take the molded, show them fire
Fire's the spark in their eyes

My flesh is ripped at daily
It's the cross I bear

I feel it tear out my insides
A pain so heavy I could collapse
I feel it just may kill me
I must brave through this storm

I am made exemplary
Lashed up by the public scene
For bearing my heart, my soul's on fire
I pull my ribs open now
Bleed my heart upon the grounds
Drink of the blood, take me in

My flesh is ripped at daily
It's the cross I bear

I feel it tear out my insides
A pain so heavy I could collapse
I feel it just may kill me
I must brave through this storm

Chain me down, nail me up
It feels so cold on my skin
Flesh cut deep from their claws
Chew my organs out
Salivating with hate
Crown of thorns, deathly boards; won't
Make me cease to be
You've turned this scapegoat into
The lion that will devour you whole

[solo: CKB]
[solo: MKH]

My flesh is ripped at daily
It's the cross I bear

I feel it tear out my insides
A pain so hard I could collapse
I feel it just may kill me
I must brave through this storm

// Like Callisto To A Star In Heaven //

Taken forcefully
A thing which never can be
Erased by time
Since he made you bleed, so violently

Painful is the kick
Inside it makes you so sick
The blood that drips down your thigh
Tarnishes virtue; lies

Wearing a mask familiar
A god forced himself on you
Raping and impregnating
Causing the exile of your life

Wearing a mask familiar
A god forced himself on you
Raping and impregnating
Causing the exile of your life

Changed like Callisto to a star in heaven

Hate not the flesh that makes me
But seek what lies beneath
My flesh and blood will make the stars
That shake bones underneath

Now a forsaken
Ghost in the eyes of her world
Banished for all time
Since he made you bleed, so violently

Painful is the kick
Inside it makes you so sick
The blood that drips down your thigh
Tarnishes virtue; lies

Wearing a mask familiar
A god forced himself on you
Raping and impregnating
Causing the exile of your life

Changed like Callisto to a star in heaven

Hate not the flesh that makes me
But seek what lies beneath
My flesh and blood will make the stars
That shake bones underneath

Cast out from the righteous life you loved
Vengeance comes down from the skies above
To wreak havoc and torment the one
Who just gave birth to her true love's son

[solo: MKH]
[solo: CKB]

Cursed to roam the Earth alone, a beast
Witnesses as her son now fully grown
Readied arm to cast a spear, to kill
Can't recognize, all he sees is fear

Wearing a mask familiar
A god forced himself on you
Raping and impregnating
Causing the exile of your life

Hate not the flesh that makes me
But seek what lies beneath
My flesh and blood will make the stars
That shake bones underneath

// Shogun //

Won't walk the Earth a specter
Won't hold my tongue from lashing out
This is my writ of honor
Drawn by the blood that I have shed
The beasts will soon assemble
Conjoining in their putrid flesh
Their hearts don't beat desire
They pump violence and poison

Flesh opens up, blood's retreating
Flesh opens up, blood's retreating
Death's embracing, all is ending
Death's embracing, all is ending

Time will not heal all of your pain
I cannot wait for it all to come crashing
Down

The monsters walk among us
Leeching the blood out from what's good
Infecting at transmission
Swallowing innocence from life
Our time has come to stand forth
The wretched womb from which they feed
Behold the loathsome demons
Send them into the hell they made

Flesh opens up, blood's retreating
Flesh opens up, blood's retreating
Death's embracing, all is ending
Death's embracing, all is ending

Time will not heal all of your pain
I cannot wait for it all to come crashing
Down on your face, ripping your veins out
Your insides win and kill you from within

And the seas will rise as serpents
Spawned from the mouth of Earth's surface
Soon the skies will fall fast, burning
Open wide and eat the suffering

The pulse is now quickening
Softly, it's painstaking
Look within to calm the storm
Raging inside the form

There's no turning back

For I'm witness to the changing

Take all you have brought to sacrifice
For you will lose much more
If you succeed in this battle
You still will lose so much more

[solo: MKH]

Time has come to face all evil

Now the seas rise up as serpents
Spawned from the mouth of Earth's surface
As the skies now fall fast burning
Open wide and face the suffering

[solo: CKB]

The inferno spews out hell's horde
Casting the flames upon our world
As death eclipses all the light
We make our last stand, 'til death: fight

[solo: MKH]

Time will not heal all of your pain
I cannot wait for it all to come crashing

// Poison, The Knife Or The Noose //

Don't let this ruin all that I thought that I could be
A life amidst entropy is a fate I refuse to see

As the flames lick our feet
Coaxing us to make the leap
Cerberus drools at the knell
Come join the wicked inside Hell

Fall fast down from grace, the world tries to make me evil
Punished in this corrupt place, life's so fucking medieval

As the flames lick our feet
Coaxing us to make the leap
Cerberus drools at the knell
Come join the wicked inside Hell

They will try to pull us down
But we won't cave in
We have something that they can't take
We know the truth inside
'Cause I will fight this by all means
With poison, the knife or the noose at me

Our world
Is a minefield
With explosives ready to eviscerate the living
Sabotage
The devious blindfold
You're helping cut a hole from here to here below your mouth
A battlefield
This fucking battle's right here
With man killing man we're only fueling our own extinction

[solo: MKH]
[solo: CKB]

Our world
Is a minefield
With explosives ready to eviscerate the living
A battlefield
This fucking battle's right here
With man killing man we're only fueling our own extinction

Die if in apathy your submissiveness their weapon
Turn inertia into rage and ram it through like a spear

As the flames lick our feet
Coaxing us to make the leap
Cerberus drools at the knell
Come join the wicked inside Hell

They will try to pull us down
But we won't cave in
We have something they can't take
We know the truth inside
'Cause I will fight this by all means
With poison, the knife or the noose at me

// Upon The Shores //

Wandering endlessly upon the shores
For something that I will never attain
Banished here for a life of nothingness
My only comfort is the sand I bleed on

Hope is gone, it will never be the same
All I feel are the repeated stings of pain
Pungent stench of the sins of the worthless ones
Faithless cries of the sins of the godless ones

Marching on in deathly silence
Upon the shores we go
Crashing tides applaud the violence
Upon the shores we go

I'm dying endlessly upon the shores
For something that I will never attain
Tortured here for a life of nothingness
My only comfort is the sand I die on

Hope is gone, it will never be the same
All I feel are the repeated stings of pain
Pungent stench of the sins of the worthless ones
Faithless cries of the sins of the godless ones

Marching on in deathly silence
Upon the shores we go
Crashing tides applaud the violence
Upon the shores we go

Charon, is this the fate for me
Is the Obolus all I pay
Cursed to wander the shores of Acheron
My eyes must have been missing silver coins

[solo: MKH]

Maggots drinking the blood of me
Insects licking the tears I weep
Hornets piercing, while wasps are breaking
Every single fucking inch of skin on me

[solo: CKB]

Hope is gone, it will never be the same
All I feel are the repeated stings of pain
Pungent stench of the sins of the worthless ones
Faithless cries of the sins of the godless ones

Marching on in deathly silence
Upon the shores we go
Crashing tides applaud the violence
Upon the shores we go
