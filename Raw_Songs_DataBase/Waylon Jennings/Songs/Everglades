He was born and raised around Jacksonville
A nice young man 'bout the kind to kill
But the jealous fight and the flashing blades
Sent him on the run through the everglades.
Running like the dog through the everglades.

Where a man can hide and never be found
And never have fear of the baying hounds
Better keep movin' don't stand still
If the skeeters don't get him in Gatersville.
If the skeeters don't get him in the Gatersville.

[Instrumental]

Well, the posse went in and they came back out
And said he'll die and there ain't no doubt
It's an eye for an eye the debt is paid
It won't last long in the everglades
A man can't live in the everglades.

But a man can hide and never be found
And never have fear of the baying hounds
Better keep movin' don't stand still
If the skeeters don't get him in Gatersville.
If the skeeters don't get him in the Gatersville.

[Instrumental]

Now the years went by and his girl was wed
His family gave up they thought he was dead
Now and then the people would say
They had seen him runnin' through the everglades
Runnin' like the dog through the everglades.

Where a man can hide and never be found
And never have fear of the baying hounds
Better keep movin' don't stand still
If the skeeters don't get him in Gatersville.
If the skeeters don't get him in the Gatersville...
