What is it that brings you to this part of town
Curiosity, conscience or fate
I know it's not love for I once gave you love
And all you gave me was the gate.

I got a feeling you've come back to just rub it in
And it really put me in my place
You've already put big old tears in my eyes
Why must you throw dirt in my face?

Must you keep telling me you've got a new love
I don't need you to remind me
Must you keep telling me I look so lonesome
And that my better days are behind me.

Must you keep showing me pictures of him
And boasting of his warm embrace
You've already put big old tears in my eyes
Must you throw dirt in my face?

You've already left me and broken my heart
Told me how much you don't want me
Believe I'm happier when we're apart
Why must you come back now and haunt me?

Must you keep showing me pictures of him
And boasting of his warm embrace
You've already put big old tears in my eyes
Must you throw dirt in my face?

You've already put big old tears in my eyes
Must you throw dirt in my face?...
