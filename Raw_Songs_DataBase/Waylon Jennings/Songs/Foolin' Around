I know that you've been foolin' 'round on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring and I'll take back my heart
When you're tired of foolin' 'round with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me.

I wasn't foolin' round the day I said I'd do
Many a night I wished that I've been foolin' too
I know it's foolish taking all this misery
When it's you a fool I'll always be.

I know that you've been foolin' 'round on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring and I'll take back my heart
When you're tired of foolin' 'round with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me.

[Instrumental]

Honey, fool around you'll know right where I'm at
Don't worry if I'm lonesome 'cause I'm used to that
When you're tired of foolin' round with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me.

I know that you've been foolin' 'round on me right from the start
So I'll take back my ring and I'll take back my heart
When you're tired of foolin' 'round with two or three
Come on home and fool around with me...
