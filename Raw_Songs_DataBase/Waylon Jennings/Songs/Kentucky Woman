Kentucky woman she shines with her own kind of light
She'd look at you once and a day that's all wrong looks all right
And I love her God knows I love her Kentucky woman
If she gets to know you she gets to own you Kentucky woman
She's not the kind gets turn at the drop of her name
Cause somethin' iside that she's got turns you on just the same
And she loves me God knows she loves me Kentucky woman
If she gets to know you she gets to own you Kentucky woman
Don't want much good Lord's earth beneath my feet
A gentle touch from that one girl and life is
Sweet and good there ain't no doubt talkin' about Kentucky woman
If she gets to know you she gets to own you Kentucky woman
Don't want much...
Kentucky woman Kentucky woman
