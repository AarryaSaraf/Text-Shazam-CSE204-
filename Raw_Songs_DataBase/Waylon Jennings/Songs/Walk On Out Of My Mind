I hear the echo of your footsteps
They're right in step with marching time
Since you've walked out of my life and out of my world
Please walk on out of my mind.

[Instrumental]

I know you're hidin' there in the darkness
And it's got me running scared and blind
Since you've walked out of my life out of my world
Please walk on out of my mind.

[Instrumental]

You've got footprints all over my mem'ries
I must erase them if I can
You keep stumbling through my hopes and dreams
Kickin' around my future plans.

You've got me walking round in circles
Looking for something I'll never find
Since you've walked out of my life and out of my world
Please walk on out of my mind...
