I'm a long way from home and so all alone
Homesick like I never thought I'd be
I'm a long way from home, everything is wrong
Someone please watch over me.

I'm not acustomed to this feeling
Loneliness is burning in my soul
Sometimes the mind is so mistreating
I wish I'd stayed at home like I was told.

[Instrumental]

I wish I knew the force within me
That keeps my mind out of control
What makes me reach for things that I can't see
I wish I'd stayed at home like I was told.

I'm a long way from home and so all alone
Homesick like I never thought I'd be
I'm a long way from home, everything is wrong
Someone please watch over me...
