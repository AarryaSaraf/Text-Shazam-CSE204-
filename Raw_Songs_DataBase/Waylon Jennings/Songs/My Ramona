Everybody's talking bad about Ramona
They say she's changed a lot since I've been gone
They say she may not be too glad to see me
Cause Ramona doesn't know I'm coming home.

But everybody's wrong about Ramona
They're just going by the way she's actin' now
I just can't believe the things they say about her
'Cause Ramona knows the things I wanna allow.

Ramona's gonna be the way she used to be
And I'll be proud of her just like I was before
She never was the kind to like those crowded bars
And Ramona won't be seen there anymore.

They say I may not recognize Ramona
And going by the picture they describe
The life they say she's living sure don't fit her
But I know she's still the same sweet girl inside.

Ramona's gonna be the way she used to be
And I'll be proud of her just like I was before
She never was the kind to like those crowded bars
And Ramona won't be seen there anymore...
