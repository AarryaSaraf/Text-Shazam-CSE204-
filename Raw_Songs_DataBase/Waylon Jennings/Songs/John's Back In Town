John does some singin' they call him a star
He plays with a hillbilly band
He goes lots of places picks his guitar
Old John ain't a home lovin' man.

John's got a woman he calls her his queen
He buys her them city made clothes
And she's 'bout the sweetest that I've ever seen
There is someting that John never knows.

When John is out croonin' I'm out with his queen
Passin' his money around
But if you look for me and I can't be se
You'll know that John's back in town.

[Instrumental]

When John's out a tourin' I wear his best suits
Smoke up his old big cigars
I lie with his woman, wear out his boots
Shauffer his limousine cars.

When John's making money he keeps on the go
So if you should hear he's around
Buy one of his records or go see his show
Help me keep old John out of town.

When John is out croonin' I'm out with his queen
Passin' his money around
But if you look for me and I can't be seen
You can figure that John's back in town...
