Some quiet morning let me let me tell you my mind
Before the sun find you here beside me one more time
Let me tell you my mind
How I want you to stay and never think about goin' away
Oh oh, baby let me tell you my mind.
Oh oh, baby let me tell you my mind.

Crazy things keep a running through my head
Let me tell you my mind
When my shoes are under your bed one more time
Let me tell you my mind
Tell you of the thrills I find
They will keep running through my mind
Oh oh baby, let me tell you my mind.
Mhm oh oh baby, let me tell you my mind.

If my mind could write the words to say
Let me tell you my mind
I'd read them to you some better day one more time
Let me tell you my mind
If my story never ends and I never have you again
Oh oh baby, let me tell you my mind.
Oh oh baby, let me tell you my mind...
