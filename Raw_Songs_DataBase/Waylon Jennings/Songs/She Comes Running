When loneliness is knocking at my mind
Happiness is something I can't find
Pleasure seem forty miles behind
She comes running.

[Instrumental]

If I stand in someone else's rain
Feelin' forty million miles of pain
She know just what and who's to blame
She comes running.

[Instrumental]

If my dreams all turn to seas
If my flowers turn to breeze
She knows exactly what I need
She comes running.

[Instrumental]

On the day the world puts me down
In some empty space in the ground
I'll bet if I make a sound
She'll come running...
