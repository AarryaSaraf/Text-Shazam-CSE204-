Just a kid with a song when he wandered from home
In search of the phantom of fame
She promised she'd wait but he got back too late
Just a scene from the dark side of fame.

In the wrong frame of mind he took to the wine
Holding pieces of love's broken chain
It was colder than jade in this world that he'd made
All alone on the dark side of fame.

His songs were soon curled on the lips of the world
They earned him the highest of claim
And yet his greatest desire was the simple warmth of love's fire
'Cause it's cold on the dark side of fame.

The wine took its toll and soon he grew old
Much younger than most people do
But there's no trace of shame in the sound of his name
Though he lived on the dark side of fame.

He lived on the dark side of fame...
