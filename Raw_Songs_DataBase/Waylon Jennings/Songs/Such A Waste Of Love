Oh, such a waste of love
True love and devotion
Oh, such a waste of love
On a heart so cold with no emotion.

I might as well just wrap it up
And wash it down the drain
'Cause the little happiness I knew
Just wasn't worth the pain.

You build me up
And for a little while you let me live
But love is the only thing
I find you never learned to give.

Oh, such a waste of love
True love and devotion
Oh, such a waste of love
On a heart so cold with no emotion.

Oh, such a waste of love
True love and devotion
Oh, such a waste of love
On a heart so cold with no emotion...
