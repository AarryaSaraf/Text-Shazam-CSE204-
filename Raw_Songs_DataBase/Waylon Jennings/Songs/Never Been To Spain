Well, I've never been to Spain
But I kinda like the music
Say the ladies are insane there
And they sure know how to use it.
They don't abuse it, 
Can't refuse it, 
Never gonna lose it.

Well, I've never been to England
But I kinda like the Beatles
I was headed for Las Vegas
I only made it out to Needles.
But can't you feel it,
You must believe it
'Cause it feels so good.

Well, I've never been to heaven
But I've been to Oklahoma
People tell me I was born there
Lord, I really don't remember.
In Oklahoma or Arizona
What does it matter.

Well, I've never been to Spain
But I kinda like the music
Say the ladies are insane there
And they sure know how to use it.
They don't abuse it, 
Can't refuse it, 
Never gonna lose it...
