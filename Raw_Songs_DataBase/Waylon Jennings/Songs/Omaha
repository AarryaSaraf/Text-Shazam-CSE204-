Omaha you've been weighin' heavy on my mind
Guess I never really left it all
I'm turnin' all those roads I walked around the other way
Coming back to you Omaha.

Omaha, Nebraska was that good enough for me
Always thought I was the roamin' kind
With the pockets full of dreams in my worn shirt on my back
I left there looking for some things to find.

Rode my thumb to San Francisco I worked down by the bank
Got some schoolin' faithful by the law
The hardest thing I learned there was there ain't no easy way
To get ahead behind those county walls.

So it's so long California reckon I'll be a movin' on
I'm leavin' even if I had to crawl
I've got some losin's laying round
That I left them burn waitin' there for me in Omaha.

Omaha you've been weighin' heavy on my mind
Guess I never really left it all
I'm turnin' all those roads I walked around the other way
Coming back to you Omaha.
