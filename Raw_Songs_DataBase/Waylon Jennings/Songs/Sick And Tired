Oh baby, tell me what you gonna do
Oh baby, tell me what you gonna do
I'm sick and tired
From foolin' round with you.

Get up every morning pick up somethin' to eat
I'm gonna go to work and you brush your teeth
Come home in the evenin' and you're still in bed
Got a rag tied round your head.

Oh baby, tell me what you're gonna do
I'm sick and tired a foolin' round with you.

It's the last time I'm tellin' you
Better change your ways
Last time I'm tellin' you
I mean what to say.

Last time I'm tellin' you you better stop to try
You're gonna find yourself outside
Oh baby, tell me what you're gonna do
I'm sick and tired from fooin' round with you.
