I've been cheated, mistreated, broken man, defeated
No one wanted or needed any part of me
I've been bothered and shattered till my heart's torn and tattered
Baby, are you sure you want what's left of me?

I've been busted, disgusted, hurt by those I trusted
There's a big old hurt inside where my heart should be
I've been lied on and cried on, cheated on and spited on
Even dogs think that I'm a tree
Baby, are you sure you want what's left of me?

I've been rocked on and socked on, this heart of mine's been tread on
I been cryin' so long my eyes can hardly see
I've been bad lucked, half crocked till my mind is shell shocked
Baby, are you sure you want what's left of me?

I've been busted, disgusted, hurt by those I trusted
There's a big old hurt inside where my heart should be
I've been lied on and cried on, cheated on and spited on
Even dogs think that I'm a tree
Baby, are you sure you want what's left of me?...
