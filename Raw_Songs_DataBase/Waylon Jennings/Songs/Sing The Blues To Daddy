Come on home and sing the blues to daddy
Tell it all to one who understands.

I hear that your new romance has faded
Just the way ours did sometime ago
I've lost count of all the times I've waited
For you to tell me that you've missed me so.

Come on home and sing the blues to daddy
When things don't work out the way you planned
Come on home and sing the blues to daddy
Tell it all to one who understands.

Like a child that's found a brand new plaything
Each one is more fun than those before
But there's a faithful one who's always waiting
To be picked up and kicked around once more.

Come on home and sing the blues to daddy
Tell it all to one who understands.

Come on home and sing the blues to daddy
Tell it all to one who understands...
