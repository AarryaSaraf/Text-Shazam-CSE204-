Everybody's gone away
Said they're movin' to LA
There's not a soul I know around
Everybody's leavin' town.

Some caught a freight
Some caught a plane
Find the sunshine
Leave the rain.

They say this town'll waste your mind.
Must be right cause it's wastin' mine
Some got to win some got to lose
Good time Charlie's got the blues.

My heart keeps telling me
There ain't no kid at thirty-three
Play around you lose your wife
You play too long you lose your life.

I got my pills to ease the pain
Can't find a thing to ease the rain
Sometimes I'd like to try and settle down
But everybody's leavin' town.

Some got to win, some got to lose
Good time Charlie's got the blues.
