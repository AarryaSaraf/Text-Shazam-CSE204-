Born to love only you
Destined to die alone without you
Knowing my dreams can never come true
Yet knowing that I was born to love you.

Night after night wanting for you
Living a life built around you
Knowing my dreams can never come true
Yet knowing that I was born to love you.

[Instrumental]

Knowing my dreams can never come true
Yet knowing that I was born to love you...
