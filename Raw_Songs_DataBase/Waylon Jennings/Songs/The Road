Back home the family's eatin' dinner
There's a fire in the fireside warm and bright
But I won't be there today 'cause I've got a debt to pay
And they don't let black sheep stray from the road.
No they don't let black sheep stray from the road.

My throat is out crying for water
Lord, that wind is blowing cold
That guard is watching me like a hawk up in the tree
And I'm longing to be free from the road
Yes, I'm longing to be free from the road.

Every bone inside my body's aching
And that guard don't care if I live or die
He told me yesterday son don't try to get away
For I'll lay you down to stay by the road
Yes, I'll lay you down to stay by the road...
