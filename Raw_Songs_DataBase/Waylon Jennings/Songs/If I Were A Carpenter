If I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway would you have my baby
If a thinker were my trade would you still find me
Carrying the pots I made following behind me.

Save my love through sorrow
Save your love through lonely
You can have my tomorrow
Just love me only.

[Instrumental]

If I worked my hands in wood would you still love me
Answer me say yes I would I place you above me
If I were a miller with a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your pretty clothes and your soft shoes shining?

Save my love through sorrow
Save your love through lonely
You can have my tomorrow
Just love me only.

[Instrumental]

If I were a carpenter and you were a lady
Would you marry me anyway would you have my baby?...
