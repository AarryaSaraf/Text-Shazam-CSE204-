She's the womb that you left and she's the pride that you kept
She's the innocence that you left back in your youth
She's the poems that you read she's the mouth that you feed
And she's the holy and she's truth.

Sweet dream woman of the night
Come and love me in the night
Sweet dream woman come and be
A woman to me.

She's the mother of youth she is sweet baby blue
And she's a love that you once knew but you couldn't hold
She is bad luck and good and she's all that she should be
And I see her reasons all unfold.

Sweet dream woman of the night
Come and love me in the night
Sweet dream woman come and be
A woman to me.

[Instrumental]

Sweet dream woman
of the night
Come and love me in the night
Sweet dream woman come and be
A woman to me.

Sweet dream woman come and be
A woman to me...
