I'm just here to get my things and I'll be leaving
And I've got somebody waitin' just outside
So don't start to cry to me about your hurt and misery
Cause the only thing that's hurtin' is your pride.

Wave goodbye to me and I'll be leaving
Walk me to the door and say so long
No need talking anymore saying things I've heard before
Just wave goodbye to me and I'll be gone gone gone gone.

Wave goodbye to me and I'll be gone.

[Instrumental]

Go tell all our friends that I'm a cheater
Tell 'em how I caused you all this pain
But if they start asking you just why I proved untrue
That might not be so easy to explain.

Just wave goodbye to me and I'll be leaving
Walk me to the door and say so long
No need talking anymore saying things I've heard before
Just wave goodbye to me and I'll be gone gone gone gone.

Wave goodbye to me and I'll be gone.

Wave goodbye to me and I'll be leaving
Walk me to the door and say so long
No need talking anymore saying things I've heard before
Just wave goodbye to me and I'll be gone gone gone gone.

Wave goodbye to me and I'll be gone.

Gone, gone, gone,
Wave goodbye to me and I'll be gone...
