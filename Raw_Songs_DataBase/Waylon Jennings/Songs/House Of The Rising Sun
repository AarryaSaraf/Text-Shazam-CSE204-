There is a house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising sun
It's been the ruin of many poor boys and me
Oh God, I'm one.

My mother was a taylor
She sowed these old blue jeans
My father was a gambler
Lord, down in New Orleans.

Go tell my baby sister
Not to do the the things I've done
Outshine that house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising sun.

There is a house down in New Orleans
they call the Rising sun
It's been the ruin of many poor boys and me
Oh God, I'm one...
