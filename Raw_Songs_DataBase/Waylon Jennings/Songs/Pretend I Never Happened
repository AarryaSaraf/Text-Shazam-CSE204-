Pretend I never happened
Erase me from your mind
You will not want to remember
Any love as cold as mine.

I'll be leavin' in the mornin'
For a place I hope I find
All the place must be better
Than the ones I leave behind.

I don't suppose you'll be unhappy
You'll find ways to spend your time
But if you ever think about me
If I ever cross your mind.

Just pretend I never happened
Erase me from your mind, girl
You will not want to remember
Any love as cold as mine.

I don't suppose you'll be unhappy
You'll find ways to spend your time
But if you ever think about me
If I ever cross your mind.

Just pretend I never happened
Erase me from your mind, girl
You will not want to remember
Any love as cold as mine...
