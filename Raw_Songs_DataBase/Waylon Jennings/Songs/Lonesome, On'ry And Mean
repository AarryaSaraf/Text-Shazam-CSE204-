On a Greyhound bus Lord I'm travelin' this morning
I'm goin' to Shreveport and down to New Orleans
Been travlin' these highways and doin' things my way
It's been making me lonesome on'ry and mean.

God her hair was jet black and her name was Bodine
Thought she was the queen of the Basin Street Queens
She got tired of that smoky-wine dream
She began to feel lonesome on'ry and mean.

We got together and we cashed in our sweeps
Gave onto beggar who was mumblin' through the streets
There's no escaping from his snowy white dream
On'ry and lonesome on'ry and mean.

I'm down in this valley where the wheels turn so low
At dawn I pray to the Lord of my soul
I say do Lord do right by me you know
I'm tired of being lonesome on'ry and mean...
