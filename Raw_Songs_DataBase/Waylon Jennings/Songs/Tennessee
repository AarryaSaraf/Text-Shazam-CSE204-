Tennesee, oh what I'd give to be back there
Once again with all the old friends
Who were so kind to me oh Tennessee
I was happy as could be.

Never got too much done
But livin' sure was fun in Tennessee
This big city just depresses me
Though everybody's as kind as can be.

A homesick feeling possesses me
I won't be the same till I'm back there again
Tennessee guess the country boy in me
Won't ever be at ease till I feel that southern breeze in Tennessee.

I won't ever be at ease
Till I feel that southern breeze in Tennessee...
