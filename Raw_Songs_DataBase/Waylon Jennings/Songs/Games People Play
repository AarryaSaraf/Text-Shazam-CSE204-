Oh, the games people now
Every night and every day now
Never meanin' what they say now
Never sayin' what they mean, oh no.

Well, they wile away the hours
In their ivory towers
Till they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine, oh yeah.

Lotten da la da da da
Lotten da la a dee de dee
Talkin' bout you and me
And the games people play, oh now.

Well, we make one another cry
Break a heart then we say goodbye
Cross our hearts and we hope to die
That the other one's to blame.

But neither one will ever give in
So we gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' bout the things that might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame, yes it does.

People walkin' up to ya
Shouting glory hallelujah
Well, they wanna sock it to ya
In the name of the Lord.

Gonna teach you how to meditate
Read your horoscope and cheat your fate
Furthermore to hell with hate
Come on and get on board.

Lotten da la da da da
Lotten da la a dee de dee
Talkin' bout you and me
And the games people play, oh now.

Look around and tell me what you see
What's happened to you and me
God give me the serenity
To remember who I am.

'Cause you've given up your sanity
For your pride and your vanity
Turn your back on humanity
'Cause you don't give a do de dee.

Lotten da la da da da
Lotten da la a dee de dee
Talkin' bout you and me
And the games people play, oh now...
