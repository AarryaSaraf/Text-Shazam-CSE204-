Like a raging flood that ruins a poor man's land
You keep doing things to hurt me all you can
But the thickness that we knew is growing thin
How much rain can one man stand?

How much rain can one man stand
I gave you everything but my right hand
If you won't let me love you then don't let me be your friend
How much rain can one man stand?

I can see them big ol' storm clouds movin' in
There's a stranger in your big brown eyes again
And you've told him that I'm just an old time friend
How much rain can one man stand?

How much rain can one man stand
I gave you everything but my right hand
If you won't let me love you then don't let me be your friend
How much rain can one man stand?

How much rain can one man stand?...
