We'll build the world of our own that no one else can share
All our sorrows will leave far behind the stairs
And I know you will find there'll be peace of mind
And we'll live in a world of our own.

Close the door light the lights we'll stay at home tonight
Far away from the bustle and the bright city lights
Let the world fade away just leave us alone
And we'll live in a world of our own.

We'll build the world of our own that no one else can share
All our sorrows will leave far behind the stairs
And I know you will find there'll be peace of mind
And we'll live in a world of our own.

Oh, my love oh my love I've cried for you so much
Lonely nights without sleeping while I long for your touch
Now your lips can erase the heartache we've known
Come with me to the world of our own.

We'll build the world of our own that no one else can share
All our sorrows will leave far behind the stairs
And I know you will find there'll be peace of mind
And we'll live in a world of our own.

And I know you will find there'll be peace of mind
And we'll live in a world of our own...
