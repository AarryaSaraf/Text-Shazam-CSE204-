My long and lean and hungry looks
Really used to turn her on
Till she found two hundred pounds
Or true love muscle and bone.

I made up my mind to keep what was mine
He made up mind I was wrong
To take my Ann took a hell of a man
But it sure didn't take him too long.

It sure didn't take him long
Changing her mind
Sure didn't take her long
To leave me behind.

She had breakfast with me met him at three
By suppertime she was gone
To take my Ann took a hell of a man
But it sure didn't take him too long.

Now Ann never was a righteous girl
But you really couldn't call her bad
I'd have to say as long as she stayed
Lord, she gave it all that she had.

One look at them, two looks at him
I knew I'd be a living alone
To take my Ann took a hell of a man
But it sure didn't take him too long.

It sure didn't take him long
Changing her mind
Sure didn't take her long
To leave me behind...
