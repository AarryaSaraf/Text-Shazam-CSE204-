To Taos pueblo out in New Mexico.
One night my weary feet did go
So I stopped that night in Taos.

There's a story in Taos town
That if a stranger comes around.
When a fresh snow is on the ground
A new love will be born in Taos.

That night there came a snow
In the mountains and the valleys below
And I found a love that's true I know
In Taos, New Mexico.

[Instrumental]

That night in Taos town
It seemed love was all around
And the pretty little girl I found
A new love was born in Taos.

From the first time we met
I knew her love would always be true
And I know I'll always love her too
The love that I found in Taos.

Some night if it should snow
There's a place you really ought to go
There's a legend that it's true
I know in Taos, New Mexico...
