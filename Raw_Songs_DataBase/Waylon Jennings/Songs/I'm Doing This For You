I'm coming back to you one more time
To give you one more chance to clear your mind
I know how much you don't want to be free
So I'm doing this for you, not for me.

All you have to do is apologize
I'll be there soon as I dry my eyes
I know how much you don't want to be free
So I'm doing this for you, not for me.

[Instrumental]

All you have to do is apologize
I'll be there soon as I dry my eyes
I know how much you don't want to be free
So I'm doing this for you, not for me.

I'm doing this for you, not for me...
