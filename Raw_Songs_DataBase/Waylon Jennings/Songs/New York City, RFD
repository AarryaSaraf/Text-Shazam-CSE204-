From Herte, Mississippi to Tupelo
Then I caught an eastbound freight
With sky high hopes opened out scopes
And hurt all over my face.

New York City is a bad place to be
When you're out of your head
Country style, running wild country style.

The new wears off and time wears off
And my roots are showin' through
But nobody cares about from where you came
But what they can get out of you.

And New York City is a bad place to be
When you're out of your head
Country style, running wild country style.

What would mom and daddy say
If they saw me this a way
Would they pray for me? yes they would
But nobody's heard about rainy day women
In that Herte, Mississippi neighborhood.

And New York City is a bad place to be
When you're out of your head
Country style, running wild country style.

New York City is a bad place to be
When you're out of your head
Country style, running wild country style...
