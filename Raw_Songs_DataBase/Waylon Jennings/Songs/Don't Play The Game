The hardest thing you ever do
Is love yourself, that gal don't love you
She'll cause you sleepless nights and endless pain
But if you don't like the rules don't play the game.

Everytime that girl walks by
Your heart will ache your very soul will die
But love's one sided it's just yourself to blame
And if you don't like the rules don't play the game.

You think by now I see the fool I've been
Given my heart a chance to win
Well, I do but I don't, I will but I won't
Deep inside I know I'll do again.

The hardest thing you ever do
Is love yourself, that gal don't love you
With love one sided it's just yourself to blame
And if you don't like the rules don't play the game.

If you don't like the rules don't play the game...
