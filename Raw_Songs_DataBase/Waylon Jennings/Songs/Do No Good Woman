You're looking at the man who's living in the wrong time
My mind's lost in my lonesome past
I wrote myself a sad song about troubles and a worried mind
And a do no good woman my first one and my last.

Well, I wanted the world to know her like I do
Some I tried to paint her picture in a song
I sang the blues but the only words that I knew
Were do no good woman I love you right or wrong.

From the streets of New Orleans to a Panthouse in Chicago
I tried to play the love before a time
But I just can't hold a woman in the night with the light's low
With a do no good woman always on my mind.

Look at me and you can see I've seen my better days
Hoping for better times to come
Well, I never thought that love could drive a good man too insane
That do no good woman, Lord why you ever done girls...
