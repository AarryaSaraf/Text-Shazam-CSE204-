Somewhere in Vietnam a 19-year-old soldier
Walked out of a barroom
And he said, I must be seeing things
That bourbon hit me like a baseball bat
In Bellfast Ireland a little lady
Dropped her shovel in her garden
She raced across the yard
And ask her neighbor Mrs Clancy, what was that.

In Memphis Tennessee a teacher
Raised the window, closest the river
And the children in her classroom swore
They'd heard a choir singing down the street
In Washington DC
A private secretary's lips began to quiver
And the President just put aside his papers
And rose quickly to his feet.

I lay in a cheap motel in the arms
Of someone else's woman
When a loud explosion rocked the room
And turned the morning into night
I jumped out of bed and ran into the street
With hardly any clothes on
As the sky lit up my heart stood still
And I could feel my face was turnin' white.

All at once the clouds rolled back
And there stood Jesus Christ in all his glory
And I realized the saddest eyes
I'd ever seen were lookin' straight at me
I guess I was awakened by
The penetrating sounds of my own screamin'
And it didn't take me long to stumble
Out of bed and fall down on my knees.

As tears rolled down my face I cried
Dear God, I'm thankful I was only dreamin'
And if I never go to hell, Lord
It'll be because you scared it out of me...
