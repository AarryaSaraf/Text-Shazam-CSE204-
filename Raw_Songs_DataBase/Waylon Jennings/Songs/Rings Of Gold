I remember when you said
With this ring I Thee wed
Now you've gone betrayed my trust
Rings of gold have turned to rust.

Tears can't wash away the sin
Love that's dead can't live again
Knowing there's no hope for us
Turns these rings of gold to rust.

Love before was clean and pure
Never more can I be sure
You will not betray my trust
Rings of gold have turned to rust.

Plans we made just yesterday
Sands of time have chipped away
Now they've crumbled into dust
Rings of gold have turned to rust.

Rings of gold have turned to rust...
