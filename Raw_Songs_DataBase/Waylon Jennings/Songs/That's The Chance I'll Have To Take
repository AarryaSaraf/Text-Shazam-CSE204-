Troubles and a worried mind
It seems that's all I've ever known
But now I'll leave that all behind
If you'll just leave me alone.

And if I go on loving you
If to leave is a mistake
If I'm wrong in what I do
That's the chance I'll have to take.

[Instrumental]

Don't bother now to waste the time
Saying things you've said before
I've heard it all a hundred times
But I won't listen anymore.

And if I go on loving you
If to leave is a mistake
If I'm wrong in what I do
That's the chance I'll have to take...
