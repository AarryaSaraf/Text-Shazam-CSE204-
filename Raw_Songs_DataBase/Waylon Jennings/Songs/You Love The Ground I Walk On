I work so hard to win myself a place in life
And leave behind the slums and poverty
Now I have wealth, a fancy home, a pretty wife
She loves the ground I walk on but she don't love me.

You like the places that I take you, don't you girl
At last you were where you've always longed to be
You're very much at home here in this kind of world
You love the ground I walk on but you don't love me.

And I know just what would happen
If there came a dawn
That I was broken down and out
I'd reach and you'd be gone.

Don't worry girl that kind of dawn will never come
You'll always have the things you want from me
But it's so sad to know that when we're all alone
You love the ground I walk on but she don't love me.

You love the ground I walk on but she don't love me...
