I've thought I'd take a trip to Denver
And spend a little time
I thought maybe out in Denver
I might get you off my mind.

No want, no want go with me
Just want to be alone
I might find someone in Denver
That can help me carry on.

Gone to Denver, gone to Denver
Gone to mend a broken heart
Now I was goin' and if I'm goin'
I'd better be gone, gone to Denver.

Well, I've known a quiet wild
Now I've been losing you
And I'd rather might stay here
And find out who I lost into.

Maybe I won't even miss you
Like I always thought I would
I've heard Denver's quite a city
And a change may do me good.

Gone to Denver. gone to Denver
Gone to mend a broken heart
Now I was goin' and if I'm goin'
I'd better be gone, gone to Denver.

Gone to Denver, gone to Denver
Gone to mend a broken heart
Now I was goin' and if I'm goin'
I'd better be gone, gone to Denver.
