Tonight I'm burning old love letters
Photographs and memories of you
Hoping somehow I'll feel better
And that when the smoke is gone I won't want you.

Burning mem'ries
Teardrops fall while I am
Burning mem'ries
Burning all the memories of you that I can't lose.

My heart to you no longer matters
And I can't live alone with memories
Into the fire those dreams that you've shattered
And when the smoke is gone then I'll be free.

Burning mem'ries
Teardrops fall while I am
Burning mem'ries
Burning all the memories of you that I can't lose...
