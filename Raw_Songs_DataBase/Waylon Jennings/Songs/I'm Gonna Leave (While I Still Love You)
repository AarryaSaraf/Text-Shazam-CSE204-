You took the little gifts I gave as though
Afraid each one contained some sort of bribe
And so the joy you might have had from someone giving
'Cause they can has been denied

And now the frown of discontent upon your face
Grows deep and felt with time
And I'm gonna leave while I still love you

I know there's no way that I can
Make up to you for whatever wrong
Has caused you all the pain and sorrow
That your heart has lived on for so long

And the wall you've built between us
Higher now and harder now to climb
And I'm gonna leave while I still love you

I wish that I could be all the reasons
That you need to go on live'n'
I wish that I could give you what you want
So I can get what I'm not gett'n'

But happiness is not a gift
That I can bring you tied with pretty ribbons
And so before I'm left with only bitterness
And memories of bad times

Baby I'm gonna leave while I still love you
Baby I'm gonna leave while I still love you
