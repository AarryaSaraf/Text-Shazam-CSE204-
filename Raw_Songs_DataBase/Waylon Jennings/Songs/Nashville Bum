I've been chasin' the big wheels all over Nashville
Waitin' for my big break to come
Livin' on ketchup soup homemade crackers and coolaid
I'll be a star tomorrow but today I'm a Nashville bum.

I love good and cowboy clothes and I sing through my nose
Webb said that's the way that getter done
I smoke good old PA like the Opry stars they say
I'll be a star tomorrow but today I'm a Nashville bum.

[Instrumental]

Well, a friend of a friend of mine is a friend of art divider
And he finally got me on the Opry show
I'll walk up like a star tripped and busted my guitar
I'll be a star tomorrow but today I'm a Nashville bum.

Well now here's a song I wrote by myself note to note
With a lot of help it might make No 1
You can change a word or two and I'll give half of it to you
I'll be a star tomorrow but today I'm a Nashville bum.

Yes, I'll be a star tomorrow but today I'm a Nashville bum...
