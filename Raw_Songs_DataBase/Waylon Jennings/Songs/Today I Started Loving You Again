Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartaches mend
And today I started loving you again.

What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And that crying time for me had just begun.

Oh, today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartaches mend
And today I started loving you again.

I got over you just long enough to let my heartaches mend
And today I started loving you again...
