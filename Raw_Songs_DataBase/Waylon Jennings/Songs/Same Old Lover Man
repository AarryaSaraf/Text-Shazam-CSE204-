I'm not some long lost someone
Just dropped in to say hello
I'm the same old lover man
Baby, lost so long ago.
'Cause I was born to believe
I never could deceive, believe me.

I hear no children's voices
Have they gone back to school
It's the same old lover man
Baby, still actin' like some kinda fool.
Yes, I was born to believe
I never could deceive, believe me.

[Instrumental]

It's cold outside your window
Please let me in the night is wild
I'm the same old lover man
Baby, not some lonesome innocent child.

Yes, I was born to bring a grief
Though I never was a thief
I'm the same old lover man
Baby, just dropped in to say what's new.

Yes, I was born to bring a grief
I never could deceive, believe me...
