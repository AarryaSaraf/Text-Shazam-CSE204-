I can tell that somewhere
There's someone you loved more than me
Someone you loved more than me
And it hurts to say it
But you have the right to be free
I know that's the way it should be
But I'm too far gone, too far gone
I've loved you so much for so long
I'm too far gone.

If ever your new love should
Hurt you or make you feel blue
Hurt you or make you feel blue
Remember your old love will still be around loving you
I'll be around loving you
'Cause I'm too far gone, too far gone
I've loved you so much for so long
I'm too far gone...
