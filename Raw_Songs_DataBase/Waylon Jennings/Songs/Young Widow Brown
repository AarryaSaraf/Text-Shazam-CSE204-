That Jimmy Brown died at just 25
And they lowered him under the ground
Right at his head was a mark that had read
I leave the world young widow Brown.

He left her for me now it's plain to see
Just why old Jim ain't around
I know that I've tried but the man ain't alive
That can keep up with young widow Brown.

That woman she's crazy if she thinks
That I'll just keep on a hanging around
I'd leave in a minute 'cept for one thing
That one thing is young widow Brown.

[Instrumental]

In her high steppin' style she's a goin' hog wild
This night life is a whoopin' me down
But if I lose a place then I'm out of the race
For kisses from young widow Brown.

I must be gettin' old my walk's gettin' slow
Just barely can make it around
I work night and day spend all of my pay
On pretties for young widow Brown.

That woman she's crazy if she thinks
That I'll just keep on a hanging around
I'd leave in a minute 'cept for one thing
That one thing is young widow Brown...
