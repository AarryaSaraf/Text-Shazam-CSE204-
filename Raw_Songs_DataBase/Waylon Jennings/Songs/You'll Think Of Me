You have her now she's your life
You're saying how she'll be your wife
And I wish I could be happy for you
But you see my friend I've been there too.

That's one more thing
That'll bother you
When she treats you like she's treated me
You'll think of me.

When the new wears off
And the glamor's gone
But the ties that bind keep holding on
And they're strong.

You'll think of me being with her
Like I thought of her being with them
And you and God knows who
You're happy now but wait and see
When she treats you like she's treated me.

As you wake to see
Who the next will be, 
You'll think of me.
As you wake to see
Who the next will be,
You'll think of me...
