I'll send away all my false pride
And I'll forsake all my life
I'll do what I can so you'll feel free
If you'll come and stay with me.

Lovers of the past I'll leave behind
There'll never be another on my mind
Yes, I'll be as true as true as you can be
If you'll come and stay with me.

Promises I make so faithfully
I'll keep still should you decide to leave
I'll try and see if you'll have all you need
If you'll come and stay with me.

We live a life no one has ever known
God gave life to you on your own
Hoping God that I stand finally
I can see you're gonna stay with me.

Hoping God that I stand finally
I can see you're gonna stay with me...
