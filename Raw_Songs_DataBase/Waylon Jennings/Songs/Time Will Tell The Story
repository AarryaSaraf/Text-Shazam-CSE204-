It seems I see you everywhere
You and your new lover there
Time will tell the story of your new love
Do you think he'll ever be
The man you've tried to make of me
Time will tell the story of your new love.

The day when he's a used-to-be
He'll be just as blue as me
Losing all that he dreams of
Time is all it takes to tell
The story that I know so well
Time will tell the story of your new love.

[Instrumental]

The day when he's a used-to-be
He'll be just as blue as me
Losing all that he dreams of
Time is all it takes to tell
The story that I know so well
Time will tell the story of your new love.

Time will tell the story of your new love.
Time will tell the story of your new love...
