Flyin' cross the desert in a TWA
I saw a woman walkin' cross the sand
She'd been a walkin' thirty miles on route to LA
To get a brown eyed handsome man.
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man.

Milo Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestlin' match
To get a brown eyed handsome man.
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man.

Way back in hist'ry thee thousand years in fact
Ever since the world began
Been a whole lot of women who sheddin' tears
For a brown eyed handsome man.
It was the trouble was a brown eyed handsome man.

[Instrumental]

Beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mama told her darlin' go out and find
Yourself a brown eyed handsome man.
Just like your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man.

Arrested on charges of unemployment
Sittin' in the witness stand
The Judge's wife called up the district attorney
She said free that brown eyed handsome man.
If you want your job you better free that brown eyed man.

Way back in hist'ry thee thousand years in fact
Ever since the world began
Been a whole lot of women who sheddin' tears
For a brown eyed handsome man.
It was the trouble was a brown eyed handsome man...
