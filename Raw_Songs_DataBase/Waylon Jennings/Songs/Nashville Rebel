They call me the Nashville Rebel
They say leave that boy alone
Don't you give him advice or he'll turn to ice
And you might as well talk to stone.

But I've got things to do
And things to say in my own way
I don't have time for your parties
My love's little guessin' games.

I've got songs to write in the still of night
I was born to write and sing
And I've got things to do
And things to say in my own way.

[Instrumental]

They call me the Nashville Rebel
Little girl don't you waste your time
For I've given my heart to this old guitar
You deserve a better love than mine.

And I've got things to do
And things to say in my own way
I'm the Nashville Rebel
I'm alone and I like it fine.

I'd like to have a wife and live a normal life
But I just don't have the time
'Cause I've got things to do
And things to say in my own way.

I've got things to do and things to say
In my own way...
