This letter that I'm writing would probably be
The hardest thing I'll ever do
But you see there's something you should know
I guess I should be the one to tell you.

While you failthfuly waited for me
I met someone new and I fell
Though you may not wanna hear it
Sandy sends her best and she and I both wish you well.

Sure you know as well as I
Mem'ries have a way of hangin' in your mind
And there's a lot about you
I know I'll remember for a long, long time.

But she's the girl that I love now
I guess more than I love my life itself
I pray you hold your no hurt feelings
Sandy sends her best and she and I both wish you well.

Maybe someday you'll forgive me
Realize that some things happened for the best
If it's any consolation after all the others
Until her I loved you best.

By the time you read this letter we'll be gone
I guess that's all there is to tell
But before I say goodbye
Sandy sends her best and she and I both wish you well.

I pray you hold your no hurt feelings
Sandy sends her best and she and I both wish you well...
