Well, now I can see
You're dancin' every dance with her
And it seems to me
You're dancin' much too close to her.

When you sat at our table
You sat next to her
But I know that it's true
She loves me, she don't love you.

Well, let me tell you friend I'm wise to your lies
Even tellin' me that I'm the guy for her
And if a little thing you do and say
Has given you away you're in love with her.

Well, just one more dance with her
And friend you're gonna see
Oh, what it's like to hit the floor
And do a little dance with me.

Here's your coat there's the door
I think you better leave
'Cause I just know that it's true
She loves me, she don't love you.

[Instrumental]

Well let me tell you friend I'm wise to your lies
Even tellin' me that I'm the guy for her
And if a little thing you do and say
Has given you away you're in love with her...
