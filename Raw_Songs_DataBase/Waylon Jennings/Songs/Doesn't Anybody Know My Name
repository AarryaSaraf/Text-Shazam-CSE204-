I've been away for so long
Fought a war that's come and gone
Doesn't anybody know my name?
My sister upped and wed
Mom was sick and took to bed
And my old dog Red's gone lame.

Please tell me if you can
What time the trains roll in?
(Two-ten, six-eighteen) ten-forty-four.

This old house is falling down
There ain't no need in me for hanging round
Doesn't anybody know my name?
The girl I left behind
She's gone with this friend of mine
I don't have to see a sign
To know things ain't the same.

Please tell me if you can
What time the trains roll in?
(Two-ten, six-eighteen) ten-forty-four.

You can't get far away
On just a soldier's pay
Doesn't anybody know my name?
Used to be when I could see
Everybody wanted me
Guess nobody cares to see
A blind man catch a train.

Please tell me if you can
What time the trains roll in?
(Two-ten, six-eighteen) ten-forty-four...
