That's the very same door that I carried her through
On the night we were married last June
And right overthere is the very same chair
That she sat in when she said we're through.

Overhere you can see where I got on my knees
And I begged but her heart was a stone
Overhere's where I cried did you know I'd died
Right here in this very same room.

[Instrumental]

To your right there's a crib and it's never been used
Perhaps that's why we're apart
And there sits a phone that she used on alone
To make plans with her new sweetheart.

Then she walked overhere and she picked up her things
Then left me alone in the gloom
Overhere's where I cried did you know I'd died
Right here in this very same room.

Right here in this very same room...
