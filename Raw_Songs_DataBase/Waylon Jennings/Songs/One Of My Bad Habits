I gotta quit this smokin'
It's because of my chokin'
I gotta quit this drinkin'
It's been messin' up my thinkin'.
Baby, you're included in my plan
You're one of my bad habits
I'm gonna quit you if I can.

I gotta quit this cryin'
'Cause you won't quit your lyin'
You dig another guy
And I'm sick and tired of tryin'
I'm gonna have to face it like man.
You're one of my bad habits
I'm gonna quit you if I can.

I've gotta quit this hopin'
You'll change and stop this mockin'
All that you been sayin'
Was just the game you're playin'
Woman don't be reachin' out your hand.
You're one of my bad habits
I'm gonna quit you if I can.

[Instrumental]

I've gotta quit this hopin'
You'll change and stop this mockin'
All that you been sayin'
Was just the game you're playin'
Woman don't be reachin' out your hand.
You're one of my bad habits
I'm gonna quit you if I can.

You're one of my bad habits
I'm gonna quit you if I can...
