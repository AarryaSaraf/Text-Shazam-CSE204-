Woman you get meaner every day
And your naggin' is hard to stand
So I'll pack my things and I'll be on my way
'Cause it's time to bum again.

This house gets smaller with every day
And the walls are closin' in
I guess I've said all there is to say
And it's time to bum again.

The time has come to bum again
I'm gonna see all the places I ain't been
Woman you've stirred up the wild, wild wind
And it's time to bum again.

[Instrumental]

I'll visit my buddy out in Bakersfield
We soldiered together years back
We'll talk night and day till there's no more to say
Then I'll head on down the track.

I may come back in a year or two
And you may not desire me then
There are some things that a man must do
And it's time to bum again.

The time has come to bum again
I'm gonna see all the places I ain't been
Woman you've stirred up the wild, wild wind
And it's time to bum again.

Woman you've stirred up the wild, wild wind
And it's time to bum again...
