If heartaches brought fame in love's crazy game
I'd be a legend a living legend in my time
If they gave gold statues for tears and regrets
I'd be a legend a living legend in my time.

But they don't give awards and there's no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken over love that's in vain
If loneliness meant world acclaim everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend a living in my time.

[Instrumental]

But they don't give awards and there's no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken over love that's in vain
If loneliness meant world acclaim everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend a living in my time...
