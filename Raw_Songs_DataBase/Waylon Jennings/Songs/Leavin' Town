There she goes again see her smiling
So happy with the new love that she's found
See her whisper in my ear
All those things I used to hear.

Oh, how that hurts me so I'm leavin' town
She's the reason why I'm leavin' town
I'm going far away where no one knows me
When morning comes well, I won't be around.

To see her whisper in his ear
Kiss and call him dear
Oh, I can't stand that so I'm leavin' town
Bet she's even glad I'm leavin' town.

[Instrumental]

I'm going far away where no one knows me
When morning comes well, I won't be around
To see her whisper in his ear
Kiss and call him dear.

Oh, I can't stand that so I'm leavin' town
Packin' up my hurt and leavin' town
Mhm, leavin' town
Bet she's even glad I'm leavin' town...
