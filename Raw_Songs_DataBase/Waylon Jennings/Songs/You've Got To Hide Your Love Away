Here I stand hand in hand
Turning my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
With no love at all.

Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
I can hear them say.

You've got to hide your love away.
You've got to hide your love away.

How can I even try, I can never win
Hearin' them, seein' them in the state I'm in
How could she say to me love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns let me hear you say.

You've got to hide your love away.
You've got to hide your love away...
