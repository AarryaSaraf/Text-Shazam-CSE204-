You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair
Ruby, are you contemplating going out somewhere
The shadows on the wall tell me the sun is going down
Oh, Ruby don't take your love to town.

It wasn't me that started that old crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chores
I know Ruby, that I'm not the man I used to be
But Ruby, I still need your company.

[Instrumental]

It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralized
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age Ruby I realize
But I've heard them say it won't be long until I'm not around
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town.

She's leaving now for I just heard the slammin' of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam a hundred times before
If I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town...
