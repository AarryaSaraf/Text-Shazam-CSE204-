Now that I've made up my mind you're gone
It should be easier now
Perhaps now my heart will stop hanging on
It should be easier now.

The lesson I've learned from you gold can't buy
A heart can be broken and still survive
Thanks to you now a much wiser man am I
And it should be easier now.

[Instrumental]

The worst now is over I've stood the test
It should be easier now
They say everything happens for the best
It should be easier now.

The wounds in my heart you've carved deep and wide
Hollowed and washed by the tears I've cried
But now there'll be more room for love inside
And it should be easier now...
