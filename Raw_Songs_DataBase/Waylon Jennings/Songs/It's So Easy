It's so easy to fall in love.
It's so easy to fall in love.

People tell me love's for fools
So here I go breaking all of the rules
Well it's so easy, so dog-on easy
Well it's so easy
Where you're concerned my heart's concerned.

It's so easy to fall in love.
It's so easy to fall in love.

It's so easy to fall in love.
It's so easy to fall in love.

Look into your heart to see
What your love book has set apart for me
Well it's so easy, so dog-on easy
Well it's so easy
Where you're concerned my heart's concerned.

It's so easy to fall in love.
It's so easy to fall in love...
