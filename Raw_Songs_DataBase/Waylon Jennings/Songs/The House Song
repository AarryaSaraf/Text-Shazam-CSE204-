This House goes on sale every Wednesday morning
It's taken off the market in the afternoon
You can buy a part of it if you want to
It's been good for me; it'll be good for you

Take the grand look now; the fire is burning
Is that your reflection on the wall
I can show you this room and some others
If you care to see this house at all

Careful up the stairs a few are missing
I haven't had the time to make repairs
The first one is the hardest one to master
The last one I'm not really sure is there

This room once rang with childish laughter
I come back to hear it now and again
I don't know why you're here or what you're after
But in this room a part of you remains

Second floor ladies left in waiting
Pass the lantern tiptoe in its glass
In the room our soft brown arms cast shadows
This room is the hardest one to pass
