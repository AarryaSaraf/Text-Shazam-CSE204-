I'm just a stranger in this town
I'm just a drifter looking round
I might stay a lifetime or a week
It all depends if I'll find what I seek.

You're looking at a heart that needs a home
And a little girl to love me and me alone
One who wants a gentleman and accepts me like I am
You're looking at a heart that needs a home.

[Instrumental]

I thought I had found her many times
But love reserves the right to change it's mind
I guess perhaps my ways are strange
But without this cast I can't change.

You're looking at a heart that needs a home
And a little girl to love me and me alone
One who wants a gentleman and accepts me like I am
You're looking at a heart that needs a home.

You're looking at a heart that needs a home...
