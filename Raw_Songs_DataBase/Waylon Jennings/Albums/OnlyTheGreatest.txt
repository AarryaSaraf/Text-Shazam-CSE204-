// Walk On Out Of My Mind //

I hear the echo of your footsteps
They're right in step with marching time
Since you've walked out of my life and out of my world
Please walk on out of my mind.

[Instrumental]

I know you're hidin' there in the darkness
And it's got me running scared and blind
Since you've walked out of my life out of my world
Please walk on out of my mind.

[Instrumental]

You've got footprints all over my mem'ries
I must erase them if I can
You keep stumbling through my hopes and dreams
Kickin' around my future plans.

You've got me walking round in circles
Looking for something I'll never find
Since you've walked out of my life and out of my world
Please walk on out of my mind...

// Only Daddy That'll Walk The Line //

Everybody knows you've been steppin' on my toes
And I'm gettin' pretty tired of it
You keep a steppin' out of line 
You're messin' with my mind
If you had any sense you'd quit

[Bridge:]
'Cause ever since you were a little bitty teeny girl
You said I was the only man in this whole world
Now you better do some thinkin' then you'll find
You got the only daddy that'll walk the line

I keep a workin' every day all you want to is play
I'm tired of stayin' out all night
I'm comin' unglued 
From your funny little moods
Now Honey baby that ain't right

[Bridge]
[riff 2x]
[Solo]
[riff 2x]

You keep a packin' up my clothes nearly everybody knows
That you're still just a puttin' me on
But when I start a walkin' 
Gonna hear you start a squawkin'
And beggin' me to come back home

[Bridge]

You got the only daddy that'll walk the line

// California Sunshine //

Go West Young Man the signs all seem to say
There's San Diego, Frisco or LA
Leave that cold, cold woman far behind
Warm yourself in that California sunshine.

Go west young man become a movie star
Or anything except the fool you are
Expose the lonely corners of your mind
To a little fad of that California sunshine.

I need a change I've headed up to here
She's just playing game that's very clear
But her play mate will soon be hard to find
'Cause I'll be in that California sunshine.

[Instrumental]

They say those California girls are fine
They know how to really walk your mind
Well, one of you get ready 'cause you're mine
I'm headin' for that California sunshine.

I need a change I've headed up to here
She's just playing game that's very clear
But her play mate will soon be hard to find
'Cause I'll be in that California sunshine.

Baby, I'll be in that California sunshine...

// Weakness In A Man //

Honey, how you've changed
It makes me wonder have I ever really known you
How could you abuse and use
The kindeness and tenderness that I have shown you.

If I had known then, I have shown
The strenght on which my love could make a stand
But you've mistaken tenderness and kindness
For the weakness in your man.

I can give you almost anything
If I know what you're looking for
I can give you everything
Any other man can give and more.

He may promise you the world
But I can give you everything he can
So don't mistake my tenderness
For any sign of weakness in your man.

[Instrumental]

I may live my life alone
With walls of stone inside some lonely cell
But no man's gonna take the love I own
And never live to tell the tale.

So don't forsake the vows you made
And don't remove my little golden band
And don't mistake my tenderness
For any sign of weakness in your man.

Don't mistake my tenderness
For any sign of weakness in your man...

// Sorrow (Breaks A Good Man Down) //

Disappointments weigh so heavy
Leave it's wreckage all around
Once a good man, once respected
Sorrow breaks a good man down.

Had a good love, had a good life
Now the sadness all around
Dread the darkness, hate the daylight
Sorrow breaks a good man down.

I remember all the good times
When the world was ours to claim
Then she left me, took the sunshine
Every night wind speaks her name.

Can't stop loving, can't stop living
There's no answer to be found
No ambition, just existing
Sorrow breaks a good man down.

[Instrumental]

I remember all the good times
When the world was ours to claim
Then she left me, took the sunshine
Every night wind speaks her name.

Can't stop loving, can't stop living
There's no answer to be found
No ambition, just existing
Sorrow breaks a good man down.

Sorrow breaks a good man down...

// Christina //

Their eyes were upon me as they sat they're drinking
Their hands reach up for you with lust in their hearts
As you dance away I know just what they're thinking
As I watch them watch you it just tears me apart.

Dance while my heart breaks, Christina
Dance to the strings of your shame and my sorrow
I'll take you home when it's over
To dream all the dreams of a brighter tomorrow.

[Instrumental]

Your eyes fall out at them and the crowd all goes wild
To them you're just a woman to go with their wine
I look at you and all I can see is a child
Hating the world makes you old before your time.

Dance while my heart breaks, Christina
Dance to the strings of your shame and my sorrow
I'll take you home when it's over
To dream all the dreams of a brighter tomorrow.

Dance while my heart breaks, Christina
Dance to the strings of your shame and my sorrow
I'll take you home when it's over
To dream all the dreams of a brighter tomorrow.

// Such A Waste Of Love //

Oh, such a waste of love
True love and devotion
Oh, such a waste of love
On a heart so cold with no emotion.

I might as well just wrap it up
And wash it down the drain
'Cause the little happiness I knew
Just wasn't worth the pain.

You build me up
And for a little while you let me live
But love is the only thing
I find you never learned to give.

Oh, such a waste of love
True love and devotion
Oh, such a waste of love
On a heart so cold with no emotion.

Oh, such a waste of love
True love and devotion
Oh, such a waste of love
On a heart so cold with no emotion...

// Kentucky Woman //

Kentucky woman she shines with her own kind of light
She'd look at you once and a day that's all wrong looks all right
And I love her God knows I love her Kentucky woman
If she gets to know you she gets to own you Kentucky woman
She's not the kind gets turn at the drop of her name
Cause somethin' iside that she's got turns you on just the same
And she loves me God knows she loves me Kentucky woman
If she gets to know you she gets to own you Kentucky woman
Don't want much good Lord's earth beneath my feet
A gentle touch from that one girl and life is
Sweet and good there ain't no doubt talkin' about Kentucky woman
If she gets to know you she gets to own you Kentucky woman
Don't want much...
Kentucky woman Kentucky woman

// Long Gone //

Oh well, it's long gone, long gone
You got my baby and you're long gone
But I'll be a hangin' around
I know you're gonna put her down
She'll need someone that's true
When she wakes up one day
To find you're long gone, long gone.

You just wandered into town
Took her and you started messin' around, with my baby
You stole her heart 'cause she ain't used to your kind.
With your fancy clothes and your uptown style
It didn't take you but a little while to get your way
'Cause your pretty little lies she couldn't see behind.

And now it's long gone, long gone
You got my baby and you're long gone
But I'll be a hangin' around
I know you're gonna put her down
She'll need someone that's true
When she wakes up one day
To find you're long gone, long gone.

[Instrumental]

Well, a man in me would like to fight
To take you down by the river tonight
And rearrange your face
But that would make her hate the site of me.

So there's nothing left for me to do
Standin', watchin' that, the likes of me
Hurt the girl I love while she's too much
In love with you to see.

Oh well, it's long gone, long gone
You got my baby and you're long gone
But I'll be a hangin' around
I know you're gonna put her down
She'll need someone that's true
When she wakes up one day
To find you're long gone, long gone...

// You'll Think Of Me //

You have her now she's your life
You're saying how she'll be your wife
And I wish I could be happy for you
But you see my friend I've been there too.

That's one more thing
That'll bother you
When she treats you like she's treated me
You'll think of me.

When the new wears off
And the glamor's gone
But the ties that bind keep holding on
And they're strong.

You'll think of me being with her
Like I thought of her being with them
And you and God knows who
You're happy now but wait and see
When she treats you like she's treated me.

As you wake to see
Who the next will be, 
You'll think of me.
As you wake to see
Who the next will be,
You'll think of me...

// Wave Goodbye To Me //

I'm just here to get my things and I'll be leaving
And I've got somebody waitin' just outside
So don't start to cry to me about your hurt and misery
Cause the only thing that's hurtin' is your pride.

Wave goodbye to me and I'll be leaving
Walk me to the door and say so long
No need talking anymore saying things I've heard before
Just wave goodbye to me and I'll be gone gone gone gone.

Wave goodbye to me and I'll be gone.

[Instrumental]

Go tell all our friends that I'm a cheater
Tell 'em how I caused you all this pain
But if they start asking you just why I proved untrue
That might not be so easy to explain.

Just wave goodbye to me and I'll be leaving
Walk me to the door and say so long
No need talking anymore saying things I've heard before
Just wave goodbye to me and I'll be gone gone gone gone.

Wave goodbye to me and I'll be gone.

Wave goodbye to me and I'll be leaving
Walk me to the door and say so long
No need talking anymore saying things I've heard before
Just wave goodbye to me and I'll be gone gone gone gone.

Wave goodbye to me and I'll be gone.

Gone, gone, gone,
Wave goodbye to me and I'll be gone...

// Too Far Gone //

I can tell that somewhere
There's someone you loved more than me
Someone you loved more than me
And it hurts to say it
But you have the right to be free
I know that's the way it should be
But I'm too far gone, too far gone
I've loved you so much for so long
I'm too far gone.

If ever your new love should
Hurt you or make you feel blue
Hurt you or make you feel blue
Remember your old love will still be around loving you
I'll be around loving you
'Cause I'm too far gone, too far gone
I've loved you so much for so long
I'm too far gone...
