Album: LadiesLoveOutlaws

// Ladies Love Outlaws //

Bessie was a lovely child from west Tennessee
Leroy was an outlaw wild as a mink
One day she saw him starin' and it chilled her to the bone
And she knew she had to see that look on a child of her own.

'Cause ladies love outlaws like babies love stray dogs
Ladies touch babies like a banker touches gold
And outlaws touch the ladies
Somewhere deep down in their soul.

Linda was a lady blonde and built to last
Benny was a no good guitar picker runnin' from his past
She heard all of his songs tellin' nothin' but bad news
But she made her mind up to try to get him win or lose.

Ladies love outlaws like babies love stray dogs
Ladies touch babies like a banker touches gold
And outlaws touch the ladies
Somewhere deep down in their soul.

Jessi like the Cadillacs and diamonds on her hands
Waymore had a reputation as a ladie's man
Late one night a light of love finally gave a sign
Jessi parked her Cadillac and took her place in line.

'Cause ladies love outlaws like babies love stray dogs
Ladies touch babies like a banker touches gold
And outlaws touch the ladies
Somewhere deep down in their soul.

Ladies love outlaws like babies love stray dogs
Ladies touch babies like a banker touches gold
And outlaws touch the ladies
Somewhere deep down in their soul...

// Never Been To Spain //

Well, I've never been to Spain
But I kinda like the music
Say the ladies are insane there
And they sure know how to use it.
They don't abuse it, 
Can't refuse it, 
Never gonna lose it.

Well, I've never been to England
But I kinda like the Beatles
I was headed for Las Vegas
I only made it out to Needles.
But can't you feel it,
You must believe it
'Cause it feels so good.

Well, I've never been to heaven
But I've been to Oklahoma
People tell me I was born there
Lord, I really don't remember.
In Oklahoma or Arizona
What does it matter.

Well, I've never been to Spain
But I kinda like the music
Say the ladies are insane there
And they sure know how to use it.
They don't abuse it, 
Can't refuse it, 
Never gonna lose it...

// Sure Didn't Take Him Long //

My long and lean and hungry looks
Really used to turn her on
Till she found two hundred pounds
Or true love muscle and bone.

I made up my mind to keep what was mine
He made up mind I was wrong
To take my Ann took a hell of a man
But it sure didn't take him too long.

It sure didn't take him long
Changing her mind
Sure didn't take her long
To leave me behind.

She had breakfast with me met him at three
By suppertime she was gone
To take my Ann took a hell of a man
But it sure didn't take him too long.

Now Ann never was a righteous girl
But you really couldn't call her bad
I'd have to say as long as she stayed
Lord, she gave it all that she had.

One look at them, two looks at him
I knew I'd be a living alone
To take my Ann took a hell of a man
But it sure didn't take him too long.

It sure didn't take him long
Changing her mind
Sure didn't take her long
To leave me behind...

// Revelation //

Somewhere in Vietnam a 19-year-old soldier
Walked out of a barroom
And he said, I must be seeing things
That bourbon hit me like a baseball bat
In Bellfast Ireland a little lady
Dropped her shovel in her garden
She raced across the yard
And ask her neighbor Mrs Clancy, what was that.

In Memphis Tennessee a teacher
Raised the window, closest the river
And the children in her classroom swore
They'd heard a choir singing down the street
In Washington DC
A private secretary's lips began to quiver
And the President just put aside his papers
And rose quickly to his feet.

I lay in a cheap motel in the arms
Of someone else's woman
When a loud explosion rocked the room
And turned the morning into night
I jumped out of bed and ran into the street
With hardly any clothes on
As the sky lit up my heart stood still
And I could feel my face was turnin' white.

All at once the clouds rolled back
And there stood Jesus Christ in all his glory
And I realized the saddest eyes
I'd ever seen were lookin' straight at me
I guess I was awakened by
The penetrating sounds of my own screamin'
And it didn't take me long to stumble
Out of bed and fall down on my knees.

As tears rolled down my face I cried
Dear God, I'm thankful I was only dreamin'
And if I never go to hell, Lord
It'll be because you scared it out of me...

// Delta Dawn //

In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever had laid eyes on
But a man of low degree stood by her side
Promised her he'd take her for his bride but he lied.

Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose of days gone by
Did I hear you say he was meetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?

She's forty-one and her daddy still calls her baby
All the folks around Brownsville say she's crazy
Cause she walks downtown with a suitcase in her hand
Looking for a mysterious dark haired man.

Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose of days gone by
Did I hear you say he was meetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?

Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose of days gone by
Did I hear you say he was meetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?

Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose of days gone by
Did I hear you say he was meetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?

Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on
Could it be a faded rose of days gone by
Did I hear you say he was meetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?...

// Frisco Depot (San Francisco Depot) //

Frisco's a mile long away
You can afford to fly
But it might as well be the moon,
Lord, when you're as broke as I.
Here I sit with my head in my hands
Watching the trains roll by
Lord, the Helping Hand Mission man warned me
That the nights here got cold.
When you're cold there's nothing as welcome as sunshine
When you're dry there's nothing as welcome as rain
When you're alone there's nothing as slow as passin' time
When you're afoot Lord there's nothing as fast as a train.

Old Frisco's a mighty rich city
Now that ain't no lie
Well, they have some buildings
That reach nearly a mile in the sky.
Everyone's so busy they can't tell me the reason why
Here's a world full of people so damn many people alone
When you're alone life just don't seem worth living
While you're alive gotta learn to live with the pain.
You've been grown for so long
There's no one left who'll forgive
You find yourself searching your mind
For the links to the chain.
When you're cold there's nothing as welcome as sunshine
When you're dry there's nothing as welcome as rain
When you're alone there's nothing as slow as passin' time
When you're afoot Lord there's nothing as fast as a train...

// Thanks //

Sunday morning in the valley
We would gather for the service
Emmily Jane would run to meet me
She'd smile at papa kinda nervous.

All the people came from miles around
I can still hear the sound.

As they sang thanks to the Lord
For the sun up in the sky
For the corn that's growing high
And for the child that didn't die.

Thanks to the Lord
For the crops and for the farm
For the satrenght in my right arm
And for keepin' us from harm.

Thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks
Thanks to the Lord for a girl like Emmily Jane.

Came the day that we were married
All our folks from the congregation
Emmily Jane was like an angel
The sweetest thing in all creation.

Papa hugged me and my mama cried
everybody smiled with pride.

As they sang thanks to the Lord
For the sun up in the sky
For the corn that's growing high
And for the child that didn't die.

// I Think It's Time She Learned //

How many times must I tell her
How many times must I say
I won't be around to pick her up again
From now on she'll have to find her own way.

How many years have I loved her
While she stood by so unconcerned
But the things she don't know I'll teach her when I go
She's been wrong and I think it's time she learned.

I think it's time she learned
Love can't live when love is not returned
She thought that I would always stand by
But she's been wrong and I think it's time she learned.

I think it's time she learned
Love can't live when love is not returned
She thought that I would always stand by
But she's been wrong and I think it's time she learned.

She's been wrong and I think it's time she learned...

// Under Your Spell Again //

I swore the last time that you let me down
that I wouldn't see you if you came around
I can't tell my heart what's right or wrong
And I've been so lonely since you've been gone.

You've got me under your spell again
Saying those things again
Making me believe that you're just mine
Dreaming those dreams again
Scheming those schemes again
I've gotta take you back just one more time.

Everybody tells me that I'm a fool
That I never should have put my faith in you
Way down deep inside I guess I know it's true
No one else can make me feel the way you do.

You've got me under your spell again
Saying those things again
Making me believe that you're just mine
Dreaming those dreams again
Scheming those schemes again
I've gotta take you back just one more time.

I've gotta take you back just one more time.
I've gotta take you back just one more time.
I've gotta take you back just one more time...
