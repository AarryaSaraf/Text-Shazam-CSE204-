// Mental Revenge //

I hope that the friend
You've thrown yourself with
He gets drunk and loses his job
And every road that you travel on
Is dusty, rocky and hard
I couldn't make you love me
You only made me blue
So all in all, if the curtain should fall
Lord, I hope that it falls on you.

I will have sweet, sweet, sweet mental revenge.
I will have sweet, sweet, sweet mental revenge.

Well, I hope that the train
From Caribou Maine
Runs over your new love affair
You walk the floor
From door to door
And pull out your peroxide hair.

You never was my woman
'Cause you were never true
So all in all if the curtain should fall
Lord, I hope that it falls on you.

I will have sweet, sweet, sweet mental revenge.
I will have sweet, sweet, sweet mental revenge.

I will have sweetm sweet, sweet mental revenge...
