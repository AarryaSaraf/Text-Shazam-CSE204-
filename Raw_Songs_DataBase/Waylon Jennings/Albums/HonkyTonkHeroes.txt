Album: HonkyTonkHeroes

// Honky Tonk Heroes //

Low down leaving sun,
I've done did everything that needs done
Woe is me, why can't i see
I best be leaving well enough alone

Them neon light nights,couldn't stay out of fights
Them keep a-haunting me in memories
There's one in every crowd
for crying out loud
Why was it always turning out be me

Where does it go,the good Lord only knows
It seems like it was just the other day
I was down at Green Gables, hawking them tables
And generally blowing all my hard earned pay
Piano rolled blues,danced holes in my shoes
There weren't another other way to be
For loveable losers, no account boozers
And honky tonk heroes like me

Where does it go,the good Lord only knows
It seems like it was just the other day
I was down at Green Gables, hawking them tables
And generally blowing all my hard earned pay
Piano rolled blues,danced holes in my shoes
There weren't another other way to be
For loveable losers, no account boozers
And honky tonk heroes like me

Where does it go,the good Lord only knows
It seems like it was just the other day
I was down at Green Gables, hawking them tables
And generally blowing all my hard earned pay
Piano rolled blues,danced holes in my shoes
There weren't another other way to be
For loveable losers, no account boozers
And honky tonk heroes like me

// Old Five And Dimers Like Me //

I've spent the lifetime making up my mind to be
More than the measure of what I thought others could see
Good luck and fast bucks are too far and too few between
Catalog buyers and old five and dimers like me.

She stood beside me letting me know she would be
Something to lean on when everything ran out on me
Fenced yards ain't hole cards and like is not never will be
Reason for rhymers and old five and dimers like me.

It's taking me so long and now that I know I believe
All that I do or say is all I ever will be
Too far and too high and too deep ain't too much to be
Too much ain't enough for old five and dimers like me.

Mhm, mhm, an old five and dimer is all I intended to be...

// Willy The Wandering Gypsy And Me //

Three fingers whiskey pleasures the drinkers
And moving does more than the same thing for me
Willy he tells me that doers and thinkers say movin' is a closest thing to being free
Willy rosins his riggins laid back his wages he's dead cert on ridin' the big rodeo
My woman's tight with an overdue baby and Willy keeps yelling hey Gypsy let's go
Willy you're wild as a Texas Blue Norther ready rolled from the same makins as me
Well I reckon we're gonna ramble till hell freeze us over
Willy the wandering Gypsy and me

Now ladies we surely will take up your favors
And we'll surely worn you there never will be
A single soul living that could put brand or handle
On Willy the wandering Gypsy and me
Well dance on the mountains shout in the canyons
Swarm it ain't loose herd like a wild buffalo
Jammin' our heads full of figures and angles and tellin' us stuff that we already know
Willy you're wild...
Yeah Willy you're wild...

// Low Down Freedom //

Long haired young girl here beside me
Fit my body, warm my mind
Sleeping quiet never knowin'
By tomorrow she'll be one more thing
I'm gonna leave behind.

Like them big wheels I'll be rollin'
Like them rivers gonna flow to sea
'Cause I'd rather leave here knowin'
That I'd made the fool of love
Before it made the fool of me.

Low down freedom, you done cost me
Everything I'll ever lose Lord
You're as empty as my pockets
From the top of where you start
Down to the bottom of my shoes.

Open highway, lonesome wind blows
Tell me something I don't know
Wrapped in woman arms around me
Tell me why I'm gonna leave
And I don't really wanna go.

Low down freedom, you done cost me
Everything I'll ever lose Lord
You're as empty as my pockets
From the top of where you start
Down to the bottom of my shoes.

Low down freedom, you done cost me
Everything I'll ever lose Lord
You're as empty as my pockets
From the top of where you start
Down to the bottom of my shoes...

// Omaha //

Omaha you've been weighin' heavy on my mind
Guess I never really left it all
I'm turnin' all those roads I walked around the other way
Coming back to you Omaha.

Omaha, Nebraska was that good enough for me
Always thought I was the roamin' kind
With the pockets full of dreams in my worn shirt on my back
I left there looking for some things to find.

Rode my thumb to San Francisco I worked down by the bank
Got some schoolin' faithful by the law
The hardest thing I learned there was there ain't no easy way
To get ahead behind those county walls.

So it's so long California reckon I'll be a movin' on
I'm leavin' even if I had to crawl
I've got some losin's laying round
That I left them burn waitin' there for me in Omaha.

Omaha you've been weighin' heavy on my mind
Guess I never really left it all
I'm turnin' all those roads I walked around the other way
Coming back to you Omaha.
