A warrior, my story glory-bound and war-renowned
Amongst the poor, the sick, and shut-eye where my story found
I overcame every obstacle that's every placed
The gods have promised, victory will one day know my face
Won't be denied the pride, won't be denied my prize
RTJ all day, any day, everyday 'round here
Beat you and these other guys
Don't know, don't care, don't really give a fuck
So long as they know don't fuck with mine
And let it be known, and truth be shone
We kill shit dead, no compromise


El-Producto, now wild boy stuff, spittin' dust
Pain and rain, we know angels dump
El-Tornado on all y'all chumps

This that run and bump
That fee-fi-fo-fum, attack and smack a chump
This that killer spit
That villainous, vicious, venomous El-Tornado kick (kick, kick, kick)

Don't doubt we will mow down you dogs
No clout to spend here at all, we will now clown you all
Go shout it to the gods, "RTJ's arrived
To make your minion cry! ", burn our image in her eyes
Better get a little bit of that zen shit in ya
I'm a long hitter, but defile the fuck outta frog rap dinner
How the fuck El-Produc' get bigger, better, meaner?
Living like a sinner, mean demeanor
Eat a bleeding, screaming, mean leader
Back to the ether (ether, ether, ether)

 Bigger, better, meaner
 Ain't no days off 'til the very last breath
 Bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, better, better, meaner, meaner
 Ain't no days off 'til the very last breath, movin', movin' like a
 Bigger, better, meaner

Ain't no days off, move, move, move, move like a boss
Move, move, move, move, move like a boss
 'Til the, 'til the, 'til the very last breath
 Bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, better, meaner
'Til the, 'til the, 'til the, 'til the very last breath
 Bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger
Better, better, meaner, meaner, meaner
 'til the very last breath
 Bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger
 'til the very last breath
 Better, better, better, better
 'til the very last breath
 Meaner, meaner, meaner, meaner

'Til the very last breath
They, they, they, they, they know they soft
