Maybe if I had another chance, I would give another chance to you
Ooh, If I make another wish, I'll wish for another wish for you (For you)
One, two

Egads you heard of these lads
The myth how we made a grip never rode dick
Truly the Cadillac of how to contract L's on the quick
Stick 'em up slick talker no tricks
Its the funniest shit, finally the money up
And print on the kid and the planet hit skids
Livin' in a valley of flames like "I win"
Skyline ablaze in a Bob Ross pic
You don't have to acknowledge I'm raw give a shit
Never nah you can talk of me fond when I'm gone
Bad news bear on the lawn with big claws
Tryna hold our whole lives in its paws and applaud
Swear to god damn the whole city odd
Make a romance hard we got scars for hearts
Shit for odds baby living in a one chance LARP
So I stick to the art, Oh my god I'm
Ultra mag, put cash in bag
Running through dead zone hope I don't crash
Tenor saw motherfuck ring it up fast
Be alarmed ima harm what I can and then dash
Fuck y'all got another planet on stash?
Far from the fact of the flames of our trash?
That is not snow it is ash and you gotta know
The past got a wrath it's a lover gone mad
But I promise

Baby, if I had another chance, I would give another chance to you
If I make another wish, I would wish for a wish for you
But the brass on the magic lamp's damn near rubbed through
It's been wish after wish after wish after wish
And the chances are that none are comin' true

Amazing ain't it how we made it and didn't fake it
Life's a disguise, the truth is butt naked
Used to be a time I'd see it and not say it
Now I understand that woke folk be playin'
Ain't no revolution is televised and digitized
You've been hypnotized and twitter-ized by silly guys
Cues to the evenin' news, make sure you ill-advised
Got you celebratin' the generators of genocide
Any good deed is pummeled, punished and penalized
Rulers of the world will slice it up like a dinner pie
Race in a nation told you to identify
People take false pride and warfare incentivized
Fuck that, me and my tribe we on an iller vibe
We accept the role of the villains cause we been villainized
Stomped to the dirt of the Earth we still will arise
In the terror dome let me alone as I soliloqize
This is license to ill with a license to kill
This is nigga with a attitude in Beverly Hills
Heavy build with a pocket full of treasury bills
Got a fire high temper, find it hard to chill
I'm a lifetime member, fuck that fuck shit
Me and Jamie versus y'all with a knife and a musket
Now our tombstones read: "They were nothing to fuck with."
Please say that shit again Mike
"We're nothing to fuck with."
