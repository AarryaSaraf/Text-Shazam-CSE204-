The God

The God killer
This Tokyo and I'm Godzilla
Playing blackjack versus death
Gun on the card dealer
Just bought a Demon, I'm screaming up out the car dealer
The last temptation of Mike but I'm a god figure
Tell Beelzebub that God don't need a job
If I did the oligarchs would be missing, murdered and robbed
This is Bonaparte playing with Toussaint
And they went on a world conquest tearing your bone apart
Michael remained murderous
But still virtuous, wait to kill the petty and foul at the church services
Not a holy man but I'm moral in my perverseness
So I support the sex workers unionizing their services

You say that love me (Ayy)
I'm guessing I'ma be okay
You say that you don't feel me now
I feel like I'ma live somehow
Your love never meant much to me (Ayy)
Love never meant much to me (Ayy)
Love never meant much to me (Uhn uh)
Love never meant much

Born from the ether I just appeared out a cloud of reefer
Screamin' "Fuck the world" it can drink what's coming out my urethra
I'll slap a dying child he don't pronounce my name correct
Rules have gotta be rules any exceptions and I'm not a leader
Think in the box I'm not getting my fix then shit is iffy
Felate a donut hole wife don't get to the crib and quickly
I'll watch my mouth when I'm finished watching y'all suck clout
Don't doubt you put an ounce of that evil on me I'm flippin', Ricky
I give a inch to you simps, I'll never forgive me
Not saying it's a conspiracy but you're all against me
You see a future where Run the Jewels ain't the shit
Cancel my Hitler-killing trip
Turn the time machine back around a century

You say that love me (Ayy)
I'm guessing I'ma be okay
You say that you don't feel me now
I feel like I'ma live somehow
Your love never meant much to me (Ayy)
Love never meant much to me
Love never meant much to me (Uhn uh)
Love never meant much

Every child, woman and man
Opinion don't matter stick to your plan
If they judge, still don't budge
Don't give a inch don't give a nudge
Life a bitch, leave you battered and bent
Lose or win, gotta hold up your chin
And I put it on Jamie and me
We just gave you inspiration for free
The money never meant much
