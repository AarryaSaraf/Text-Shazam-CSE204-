Yeah
Yeah, that cash
Yeah, take it, here

From a long line of the rancidest swine came the violators
The cloven foot designers of high crime for the iron ages
Twisting down through time, see them tryna unwind creation
Don't be surprised, it's a mistake to think their influence had faded
Well, what a wretched state of danger we've made here
I thought to me, "Perhaps explaining years of self lobotomy, toxicly
Perhaps explaining tears and even tears in my cosmology"
You numb yourself for years and it can wear upon you, honestly
These old foxes got a lotta plots to out fox us (Ayy)
Tryna divvy up and dump in corresponding boxes, how obnoxious
Where the heart and mind connect, expect them targeting like archers
You will not travel towards the light if they're in charge of your departure
You'd think the universe forgot us the way the cursed pitch their product (Woo)
As though our spirits not a fire that can't be snuffed or turned to dollars
Or the expanse across all space, can't be contained in one small dollop
Now I see that its the same moment in history back to haunt us
And here we are again
Hello void, long time watcher, first time callin' in
Every cage built needs an occupant
Got a dead bolt, see 'em lock it in
Had a good run but they stoppin' it
Wanna Walkman in the coffin lid
Eat your heart out, fiction fan
Truly the truth's the stranger document

And at best I'm just getting it wrong
And at worst I've been right from the start
It hurts, I'm bein' torn apart
Theres a grenade in my heart
And the pin is in their palm
There's a grenade
There's a grenade
A grenade in my heart

At best I feel difficult, poor and you pitiful
Then everyday's like a satanic ritual
Beautiful soul with the rogue and the criminal
How long must the Holy hold onto they principles?
Kickin' and screamin' while watchin' the demons
Collecting the gold and the diamond residuals
My pastor say, "God has promised us paradise, live a good life it is pivotal"
I promised my mama that I would stay honest
But I want it all in the physical
And promise I'm honest, I'll probably be punished
'Cause keeping that promise too difficult
So picture me red as I sit on the bed
With my hands on my head and this pistol too
Why the fuck must I be miserable?
The devils, they do the despicable
And still, they move like they invincible
These filthy criminals, sit at the pinnacle
Doin' the typical, keepin' us miserable
Takin' the most and providin' the minimal
Hate to sound cynical but shit is pitiful, times is just critical
Like Jimmy Seville, they cheerfully kill kids in a ritual
I'll murder the miserables, I'll make it all biblical
I'll cut off their heads, they'll beg for their lives and I'll put it up, digital
Fuck the political, the mission is spiritual
Our murder is miracle, that was sent here to just punish through terror

Static in my mind
Like sanity on borrowed time
Like right and wrong can't be defined
There's a grenade in my heart
And the pin is in their palm
There's a grenade
There's a grenade
A grenade in my heart
