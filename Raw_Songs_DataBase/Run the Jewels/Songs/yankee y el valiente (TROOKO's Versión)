Esta semana Yankee y el valiente

Back at it like a crack addict, Mr. Black Magic, crack a bitch back
Chiropractic, Craftmatic big daddy smokin' big Cali
In the black alley, in a black Grand Natty
Rollin' down, ole natty hair
Nappy, matty as a black, grandaddy, all fact
No cappin', fat, black, bold cappin', stay floatin'
No flappin', where he runnin'? I'm a gunner
I'ma have your block hot as a sauna all summer
And I put that on Osama and my motherfuckin' momma
I'ma terrorize the actors playing like they want some drama
I'ma chop 'em with a chopper 'till I motherfuckin' drop 'em (Drop 'em, drop 'em, drop 'em, drop 'em)

Stack addict, I mack with the blackest fabric, I'm back
I'm magically rackin' it, that's what I'm thunkin', rat-a-tat-tats
I'm runnin' the trunk up for sucker shit
Matter of fact, kiss the ass and even the cra-a-ack
Automatic facts, it's like tha-a-at
Scandal bliss when you puttin' feelings in charge of shit
All of us targeted, all we doin' is arguin'
Part of them isn't workin' 'till every pockets been picked and sold and harvested
I'm ready to mob all these fuckin' Charlatans

Go-go-go-, go-go-go-go-
Go-go-go-go-, Go-go-go-go-
Go-go-go-go-, go-go-go-, go-go-
We up, now loot

Two time Don, I'm galactic and fly
The moon is movin', the maniac's in a shitty decline
Hearts fried, all this neon is grippin' in something's side
Immortality's out of bounds, this a one-round ride

I got one round left, a hunnid cops outside
I could shoot at them or put one between my eyes
Chose the latter, it don't matter, it ain't suicide
And if the news say it was that's a goddamn lie
I can't let the pigs kill me, I got too much pride
And I meant it when I said it, never take me alive

I got the Grand Nat runnin' in the alley outside
Yo Mike run like you hungry and get your ass in the ride
I'd rather have and not need you than watch your rotten demise
And you still owe for them Nikes, you do not get to just die
You try to fuck with my brother, you get the bastard surprise
And that's more honest than your whole life in a fraction of time
I didn't get my degree in how to smoke weed 'till I'm fly
So you could ruin my high, Jewel Runner, do and you're bye

My brother made a point so out the back door I'ma slide
I'm chubby, husky, die scrubbin', fuckin' up my Levi's
The crooked copper got the proper, I put lead in his eye
Plus we heard he murdered a black child so none of us cry

Yankee and the brave are here
Everybody hit the deck
We don't mean no harm
But we truly mean all the disrespect (watch them)

Go-go-go-, go-go-go-go-
Go-go-go-go-, Go-go-go-go-
Go-go-go-go-, go-go-go-, go-go-
We up, now loot
