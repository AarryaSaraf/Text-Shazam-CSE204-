The law defier, the non-complier
The death defier, the Mike Myers
Murder rapper for hire
Do-er of drive byers, the back back clack clack
Let it loose murder, all witnesses and survivors
That's a job completer, dependable contractor
The back hand wack rap slapper
Mr. leather bomber attacker
Catch ya getting off the escalator
Run the Jewels smooth and don't trigger the undertaker
As a teen lacking, I woulda ran me a supreme racket
I woulda took these lames' Supreme jackets
Until you rob a hype beast, you ain't seen sadness
"Clockwork Orange" madness, left the scene laughin'

Ayy, we forever-ever,
Jaimito y Michael the Render
The pyrotechnicrats the' ol razzle dazzlers
The magic bean imbibers (Yes)
The green giant of the rhyme contrivers (Yes)
Supreme violence of the time describers (Yes)
I'm the decider, you evil eyers
A pile driver provider for liars, the sleep depriver
The nick of time mercy kill denier in prime
I'll kill the mood of a Buddhist MacGyver
I'll slap a yapper from the acne to the tooth bone fiber, I'm liver
Thought crime designer criminal minder
And I'm a born and bred in USA who chop and screw truth up
Think I got a case of the Mondays, on fire

Ayo, one for mayhem, two for mischief
Now aim for the drones in your zoning district
Hindenburg 'em, get 'em, burn 'em
Can't give the ghost up, no resistance
Pass that shit, Mike, I have to insist it
Reality sucks dick, how's that for wisdom?
I'll lick a toad's back like, "Mmm, delicious"
Time elves wave to me off in the distance
Hey lil' guy I'm just walkin' through
From another timeline where monsters eat truth
Physicists say the dough I get's proof
The multiverse lives, I'm supposed to just lose
The glass bottom tank I drive is all fueled
Better try to stay cool honey bunny don't move
Fuck shit glows in the hearts of the brutes
You hate Run The Jewels, you don't love the troops
You miss the point tryna act like shit's cool
Don't fuckin' tell doom your number's not due
Every other goddamned year I'm brand new
It's been 20 plus years you think that's a clue?
Maybe this guy kinda kills what he do
He's prolly that dude he left enough proof
Plenty of these goofs just disappeared, poof
I'm still the next big thing, gotta hurt, oof, I got

Fire, fire, fire, hot fuego

This the pay back, allow me to state that
All that forth back, we don't play that
You want beef, bruh, you just state that
And we steak that, fry and bake that
One time in the big old south
Lived a lil chubby kid with a big ol' mouth
Lame writers gave him big ol' doubts
Now the same lil boy in a big ol' house
Look at him now in the big ol' cars
And the same folk hated pay big homage
One minute let me be candid
Used to stand by the garbage can hand to handin'
That dumb trap shit, no proper planning
Seen ignorant shit like geekers dancing
And rappers rap about it like it's so romantic
But I still can't seem to escape the panic
PTSD streets did the damage
Kept me in hammock, laid back with cannons
Get me fucked up, it be's calamity
I'ma come through and leave some damages
Goddamn somebody call 'ambulams', or ambulances out of chances
Fuck that weak shit, you be bantering
You're a common cold and my flows are cancerous

Fire, fire, fire, hot fuego

Take that, mother...
