Love, came quite by surprise
Hit me right between my eyes
And made me realize
You and I
We were born right from the streets
We both know how to stay alive
We both knew how to shuck and jive
Didn't we, baby?
Such a cold blow when you tried to tear my po' heart down
I was man enough to stand my ground
Even though you didn't want me around
I was a fool, baby

Now you come right back on the scene
Tryna run that same game on me
Stop playin' with my heart
Just leave before you start
Furthermore, my baby (Furthermore, baby)
I won't be fooled no more
(I won't be fooled)
Furthermore, my baby (Furthermore, baby)
I won't be fooled no more
(I won't be fooled)

I was a fool, baby
But I won't be fooled no more

Love, the day you walked on me I died
For days I sat around and cried
I even thought of taking my life
I was a fool, yeah
As time went on, I grew stronger within myself
I wrote a song and changed my name
From the street I went to wealth and fame, ah yeah
Now this fool on the street
That you knew and loved a long time ago
Has died and changed his name
Somebody else has taken his place, and he doesn't know your face

Now you come right back on the scene
Tryna run that same game on me
Stop playin' with my heart
Just leave before you start
Furthermore, my baby (Furthermore, baby)
I won't be fooled no more
(I won't be fooled)
Furthermore, my baby (Furthermore, baby)
I won't be fooled no more
(I won't be fooled)

Yeah, you fooled me but you'll never fool me anymore
I was a fool for you, baby
Yeah, you fooled me but you'll never fool me anymore
Yeah, I was a fool on the street
Yeah, you fooled me but you'll never fool me anymore
Yeah, you fooled me but you'll never fool me anymore

Had enough, had enough, had enough, had enough
Had enough, had enough, had enough, had enough

I was a fool for you, baby
I was a big fool, baby, but I won't be no more
Fool for you, baby
Fool for you, baby
Big fool, baby
I was a stupid bloomin' fool, yeah, yeah yeah

When you are on the street and someone you meet
Don't be foolin' me, don't be foolin' me
When you are on the street and someone you meet
Don't be foolin' me, don't be foolin' me
When you are on the street and someone you meet
Don't be foolin' me, don't be foolin' me
When you are on the street and someone you meet
Don't be foolin' me, don't be foolin' me
When you are on the street and someone you meet
Don't be foolin' me, don't be foolin' me
When you are on the street and someone you meet
Don't be foolin' me, don't be foolin' me
When you are on the street and someone you meet
Don't be foolin' me, don't be foolin' me
When you are on the street and someone you meet
Don't be foolin' me, don't be foolin' me
