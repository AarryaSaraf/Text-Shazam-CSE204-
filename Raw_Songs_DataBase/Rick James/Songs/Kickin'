In the shadow of the night
I hear your voice and I'm alright
It's in my ear, it sounds so clear
It makes me crazy

In the middle of a dream
I wake up to a silent scream
I can't escape your haunting sound
Please come to me, baby

And don't be trickin' (trickin', trickin', trickin')
Of my word stickin' (stickin', stickin', stickin')
When I'm with you, and you're with me
My love's alive and kickin'

Kickin', baby
My love is alive
Kickin', baby
My love is alive, yeah
Kickin', baby
My love is alive
Kickin', baby
My love is alive, yeah

In the middle of a day
I think of every word you say
When we lay down, I feel like we're
So close we are one

At the end of every night
I think of how I hold you tight
The words I said, we lay in bed
Lost in each other's eyes

Love, don't be trickin' (trickin', trickin', trickin')
Of my word stickin' (stickin', stickin', stickin')
When I'm with you, and you're with me
My love's alive and kickin'

Kickin', baby
My love is alive
Kickin', baby
My love is alive, yeah
Kickin', baby
My love is alive
Kickin', baby
My love is alive, yeah
Kickin', baby
My love is alive
Kickin', baby
My love is alive, yeah
Kickin', baby
My love is alive
Kickin', baby
My love is alive, yeah

Do it
Do it
Do it
Pump it up

My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah
My love is alive
My love is alive, yeah

Keep on kickin', baby
Do-do-do it, pump it up
Keep on kickin'
Do-do-do it, pump it up, pu-pu-pu-pu
Keep on kickin', baby
Do-do-do it, pump it up
Keep on kickin'
