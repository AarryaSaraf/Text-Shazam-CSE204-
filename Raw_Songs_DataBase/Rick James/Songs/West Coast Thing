Wow... L.A. City of the angels. Palm trees, sunshine, honies everywhere

- Ooh girl, look! Ain't that Rick?
- Mm-hm! 

Yo girl!

Girl if you stop on by (right), my house for just a minute
We can lay by the poolside, sipping gin and juice
Throw some Mary Jane, and talk about our future
Together forever, me and you

Girl this LA town, is freaky and it's crazy
And you got to get down in order to come up
So girl let's kick this game around for just a minute
Together, we're in it to win it

In the summertime, we touch to the music
In the Hollywood nights, down on Sunset Strip
In the summertime, everybody's grooving
Girl, ain't nothin' but a west coast thing, y'all!

Woo!
Keep me rockin', keep me rockin' baby
All night long
Keep me rockin', keep me rockin' baby
West coast thing, yo

Girl if you're by sometime (right), we're drive down to the ocean
Grab some beer and some wine, and kick back on my yacht
You'll call your finest friends, and tell them to bounce over
And we'll sail to a spot nice and hot

California groovin', ain't nothin' but a party
You should see the freaks movin', down on Malibu beach
San Francisco Bay, down to San Diego
It ain't nothin' but a west coast thing, y'all!

In the summertime, we touch to the music
In the Hollywood nights, down on Sunset Strip
In the summertime, everybody's grooving
Yeah, it ain't nothin' but a west coast thing, y'all!

In the summertime, we touch to the music
In the Hollywood nights, down on Sunset Strip, yeah
In the summertime, everybody's grooving
It ain't nothin' but a west coast thing, y'all!

Here we go
Keep me rockin', keep me rockin' baby
All night long
Keep me rockin', keep me rockin' baby
West coast thing

Here we go
Ain't nothin' but a west coast thing
Ain't nothin' but a west coast groove
In the pool, in the pool

Yo, what's up?
Hollywood, yeah
LBC, and the San Francisco Bay
Give it up, y'all
In Old Town
Here in west coast thing, yo

Ain't nothin' but a west coast thing, a west coast thing...
