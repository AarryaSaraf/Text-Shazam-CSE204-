You got it real good
Real good
You got it real good

Oh baby, baby, you really drive me crazy
With all of your stuff
You know I never doubt you, I can't live without you
I can't get enough

Oh baby, baby, please tell me maybe
You'll give me a try
I'm waiting and I'm ready, I bought you this new teddy
I'm ready to fly

Girl, you got it real good
(Girl, you got it real good)
Girl, you got it real, real good
(You know you got it good)
Girl, you got it real good
(You got it so good)
Girl, you got it real, real good
(Mm-mm-mmhm, good)

You got it real good
Real good
You got it real good

Girl I've been chillin', I'm waiting and I'm willing
To give you my all
I know you will remember that time when in September
We had us a ball

Remember, we were wasted, and oh, how sweet you tasted
With kiss after kiss
I know I won't forget it, but girl I just can't quit it
I just can't resist

Girl, you got it real good
(Girl, you got it good)
Girl, you got it real, real good
(You know you got it good)
Girl, you got it real good
(You got it so good)
Girl, you got it real, real good
(Good, good, good, good)

Girl, you got it real good
(Girl, you got it good)
Girl, you got it real, real good
(You know you got it good)
Girl, you got it real good
(You got it so good)
Girl, you got it real, real good
(Mm-mm-mmhm, good)

You got it real good
It's real good

Girl, you got it real good
Girl, you got it real, real good
Girl, you got it real good
Girl, you got it real, real good, real good, real good

You got it real good
You got it, you got it, you got it, you got it
You got it real good
You got it, you got it, you got it, you got it
You got it real good

You got it, you got it, you got it, you got it
You got it really, really good
You got it real good
It's real good
You got it really, really good
You got it real good
You got it real good
You got it real good
You got it really, really good
