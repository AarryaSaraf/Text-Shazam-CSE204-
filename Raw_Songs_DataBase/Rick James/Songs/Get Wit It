Girl, I could get you if I wanted to
Come girl and get it, come girl and get-get wit' it
Girl, I could get you if I wanted to
Come girl and get it, come girl and get-get wit' it

Can't nobody ever say, what they will not do
Give them just a minute, you will change a mind or two
Kissing on the right face, softly on the right place, now
Make you do some strange things, and until your face brings smile

Oo-oo-oo-ooh

Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
Come girl and get it, come girl and get-get wit' it
Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
Come girl and get it, come girl and get-get wit' it

I know it's just incredible, I gotta bust this
And run a rhyme about a feeling that I know you miss
It's self-explainable, it's so attainable
Just like a higher level, that you wanna reach
Or like a war of practice, but you never preach
Say he's so reliable, but so deniable
Or everytime you see him, you're so triable
Stop fakin', you know you want him!

You always tell your friends, that you never just get loose and play
Now I understand why they never hear a word you say
Everytime you see me, you always act so strange and shy
Stuck-up little cute girl, and now I know the reasons why

Oo-oo-oo-ooh

Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
Come girl and get it, come girl and get-get wit' it
Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
Come girl and get it, come girl and get-get wit' it

Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
Come girl and get it, come girl and get-get wit' it
Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
Come girl and get it, come girl and get-get wit' it

He reads you like it's history, you're not a mystery
You're like a light show, ready girl and good to go
He wanna try you, and he could buy you
And if your loving is that good he won't deny you
You wanna play it cool? Oh really, who's the fool?
You heard the rumour and it said that he was really cruel
You got your own mind, and give it in time
He is the champagne, and you're the cheap wine
You're gonna write your friends, and talk about him
What's in your dreams, and now you never doubt him
It's really plain to see, he is your fantasy
And in his life girl, is where you wanna be

Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
I could get it (like this y'all), I could get it
Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
Let me get it (like this y'all), come and get it

Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
I could get it (like this y'all), I could get it
Girl, I could get you if I wanted to (like this y'all)
Come girl and get it (like this y'all), come girl and get-get wit' it

Get it
Get it
Get wit' it

Show me what you really wanna do for me tonight girl, girl...
(Get it, get-get-get-get it)
Let me just go down on you, so I can finally feel it too, too...
(Get it, get-get-get-get it)
Give me so much joy, that I will always be your love toy, toy...
(Get it, get-get-get-get it)

Oh, do it just like that...
