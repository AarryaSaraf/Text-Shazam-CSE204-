Turn the lights off
Woman come to my bed
Lay beside me, rest your beautiful head
No need for you to feel alone
Now that you're in my home, my love

Don't be nervous
And girl don't be shy
I won't love you and then say goodbye
There's no need for you to resist
Now that we have kissed, my love

Feel the fire
Feel the flame as it grows
Where we will burn too
Only heaven knows
There's no need for you to be alone
Now that you are in my home, my love
My love
