It was a summer's day, when I first laid eyes on you
So small, pretty and petite, and oh, how you could sing
I remember the way you looked at me as you sat playing your piano
And the smiles of joy upon our faces, as we talked about our futures

Tears fill my heart everytime I hear you sing to me
And as time went on, you became such a star
The heavens were ignited and delighted by your brightness
And oh, how the people loved you and cheered your name

(Oh baby, oh baby...)

But all those times and all those lyrics between the lines
Became the very pain, that will someday separate us
I'll never forget, though the song lingers on
Of the love that's still strong, the memories of you
And I will always stay tuned in my heart tomorrow

So may your star continue to shine
And may you always remember that in my life
You are something called love
