Mama, sit down for me please
Daddy, comfort her in this time of need
Your one and only son has got to get away
Before this ghetto life becomes the death of me

Goodbye Mama, Goodbye Papa
I'm going to do good in Hollywood
Goodbye Mama, Goodbye Papa
I'm going to do good in Hollywood
Hollywood

You have always taught me right from wrong
You always told me I could sing myself a song
Mom, I got to go, it's a case of do or die, do or die
It's like you always told me, keep your head to the sky

Goodbye Mama, Goodbye Papa
I'm going to do good in Hollywood
Goodbye Mama, Goodbye Papa
I'm going to do good in Hollywood
Goodbye Mama, Goodbye Papa
I'm going to do good in Hollywood
Goodbye Mama, Goodbye Papa
I'm going to do good in Hollywood
Hollywood

You know, I've been dreaming
I've been looking to the stars for light
Mom, I've been thinking about it
You know, I've been thinking about it all my life, all my life
And I've been hoping, I've been hoping
One day I might go to Hollywood, to Hollywood
Where the singers, and the movie stars, and the people, living mountains
And the sun shines all the time
Ain't nothing much, and I got to keep on

Keep on, keep on, you're gonna make it good in Hollywood
Keep on, keep on, you're gonna make it good in Hollywood
Keep on, keep on, you're gonna make it good in Hollywood
Keep on, keep on, you're gonna make it good in Hollywood
Keep on, keep on, you're gonna make it good in Hollywood
Keep on, keep on, you're gonna make it good in Hollywood

People keeping on, keeping on, and keeping on
Keep on, uh
Won't be long
Till I get there
Till I get there
Won't be long
I'm gon' be there
Lord knows I got to be right there
Won't be long and
Won't be long and
Won't be long and
Won't be long and
Won't be long and
Won't be long and
Won't be long and
Won't be long and
Till I get there
