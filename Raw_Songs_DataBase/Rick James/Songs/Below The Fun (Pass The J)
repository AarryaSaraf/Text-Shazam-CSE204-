I was born in a city we call Buffalo
Zero degrees below is too damn cold and funky
Mama raised me on the numbers racket
With eight kids and no father
Said she couldn't hack it
On the eastside where I started
Singin' on the corners
Hangin' out with all the hoodlums
Pass the joint
Now the love I find in the city
Is such a cryin' pity
Ain't no love for brothers
Pass the joint
I think I want to talk
'Bout the place I was born, I was torn
Said pass the joint
Give me one mo' hit
I ain't finished with it
I got some more to say
Now the players hangin' 'round the main strip
Actin' like they're on a trip
If they had my cash they could be hip
But it's strange the gossip is so tragic
They call me a faggot
Me and all my women laugh at it
Love I got my good friends there
They really keep me dancin'
They really keep me laughin'
In the country me, my dog and horses
Hangin' out with my family talkin'
'Bout stone city
Pass the joint
I wanna talk 'bout the city I was born
I think I wanna talk 'bout the place where I was torn
Said pass the joint
I need one mo' hit
I ain't finished with it
I got some more to say
'Bout the city I was born
I got to talk
I wish they wouldn't be so torn
I wanna talk 'bout the city I was bred
I need to talk 'bout the city that has led me to my thang
I was born in a city we call buffalo
Zero degrees below is too damn cold and funky
I think I wanna talk about it
Ooh pass the. Joint
La la la la la la la la la
I think I wanna sing about it
Pass the joint
Thank you
