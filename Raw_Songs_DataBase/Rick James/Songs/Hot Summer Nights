Sometimes in winter, I'm coldest to you
Icy cold feelings are on my mind
Sometimes in winter, I sit by the fire
Frozen on snowflakes of my desire


Don't worry baby
I'll be there, beside you
To warm you like hot summer nights

Don't worry darling
Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm here, by your side


Summer nights, baby
It's gonna be... (alright)
Summer nights, baby

Sometimes in winter, I'm cold to your teach
And my feelings are empty, and I don't know
Sometimes in winter, I tremble in fear
Thoughts of you leaving knock me here


Don't worry baby
I'll be there beside you
To warm you like hot summer nights

Don't worry darling
Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm here, by your side


Don't worry baby
Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm here, by your side

Summer nights, baby
It's gonna be...
Summer nights, baby
It's gonna be...

Summer nights...
