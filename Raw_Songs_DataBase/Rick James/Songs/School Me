School ya, school ya, school ya
School ya, school ya, school ya

Hey baby, let me be your teacher
Your secret lover or your preacher
I'll teach you everything from A to Z to keep you loving me

Hey baby, my love - you should try it
Don't be afraid girl, don't deny it
I'll show you how it feels to have a special lover in your life

Baby let me
School ya, school ya, school you, yeah
Baby let me
School ya, school ya, school you, yeah
Baby, baby, baby

Hey baby, let me be your lover
And when I'm through you'll have no other
Bring out the best in you and girl bring out the best in me

I'm not into infatuation
Or just a flighty child relation
I'm talking you and me exploring realms of ecstasy, yeah

Baby let me
School ya, school ya, school you, yeah
Baby let me
School ya, school ya, school you, yeah
Baby, baby, baby

Baby let me
School ya, school ya, school you, yeah
Baby, baby, baby
Baby let me
School ya, school ya, school you, yeah

I know we met girl for a reason
I'll change your mind just like a season
Don't wanna fool you, just to school you
Thru the things you'd like to try, yeah

Baby let me
School ya, school ya, school you, yeah
Baby, baby, baby
Baby let me
School ya, school ya, school you, yeah

Baby let me school you, on what to do
School ya, school ya, school ya
School ya, school ya, school ya
School ya, school ya, school ya
