Darling, there are memories in my mind
I can remember so well
You were singing as I played my guitar
Love was in making in Portugal

There were feelings, I touched each part of you
And you surrendered all your charms
Love was blooming, and girl if you remember
I never felt that way before

Baby, you loved me in so many ways, baby
Slow and easy
You made love to me all night long
Slow and easy
Slow and easy

Darling, there are stories we could tell
About our feelings, and our love
And I realize, you know me oh, so well
Are you an angel from up above?

You were tender in our romance
And we sang it in a slow dance
And I knew you were mine
And the many tender pleasures
that no feelings could out-measure
Girl, so beautiful and fine

Yeah, you loved me in so many ways, baby
Slow and easy
I'll make love to you all night long
Slow and easy, oh yeah

Next time it'll be better, baby
Slow and easy
Slow and easy

I'll make love to you till it's almost dawn
Slow and easy
Slow and easy

Slow and easy
Nice and mellow
Slow and easy
Soft and gentle

Slow and easy
Soft and gentle
Baby you move me, yes you move me
Slow and easy...
