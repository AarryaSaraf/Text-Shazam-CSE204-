Come here, baby
I'm feelin' so good
I want to
Tell the world about it
I got to let you know

I'm feelin' so tough
Want to scream
And want to shout it
And let my feelings show

I'm feelin' so strong
Couldn't stay away
Too long
I just went out for a while

But now I'm back y'all
Did you think
That I would fall
And not get up in style?

I feel a fire in my feet
Feel my shoes about to heat
I got no (Rock and roll control)

I feel my body burnin' hot
I don't even want to stop (Rock and roll control)

Come here, baby
(Rock and roll control)
(Rock and roll control)

I was so shy
All I did was get high
And live my life in a dream

I was snowblind
That my two eyes couldn't find
A true reality

I was so low
That the only place I'd go
Was deep inside my mind

That's when I found out
What my heart was all about
And now I'm feelin' fine

I feel a fire in my feet
Feel my shoes about to heat
Got no (Rock and roll control)

There's a burnin' in my shoes
Wanna scream
And shout the news (Rock and roll control)

Feel the fire in my shoes
Want to scream
And shout the news (Rock and roll control)

Come here, baby
Feel a fire in my feet
Feel my shoes about to heat (Rock and roll control)

Gimme the rock
Gimme the roll
Wanna scream
Wanna loose control
(Rock and roll control)

Once upon a time
A friend of mine
In New York City said
"What's the matter with you, boy
And what's wrong with your head?"

(Ain't got no)
(Rock and roll control)

Feel the fire in my feet
Feel my shoes about to heat (Rock and roll control)

Gimme the rock
Gimme the roll
Wanna thrill and fill my soul
(Rock and roll control)

Wanna scream
And wanna shout
Wanna tell the world about
(Rock and roll control)
(Rock and roll control)
