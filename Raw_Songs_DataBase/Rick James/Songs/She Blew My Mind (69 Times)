Just like the fool I went and stayed too long
I never listen to your tender song
My only wish to was just to satisfy
And keep you happy till the day I die

You got hung up that night we made love
And when your cried what were you thinking of?
I kiss the tears and fears off your face
That's when you let another take my place, yeah!

You turn my head around
Turn me upside down
You turn my head around
Blew my mind... 69 times
Yeah...

Why you want to go and break my heart? Yeah!
Just like a child you had to have your cake
Playing with me that was your first mistake
There are too many cakes and pies to taste
You are the one I did not want to waste
Just like a baby acting insecure
When all the time I thought that you were sure
You are the twinkle turn into a star
Just this time little girl, you've gone to far, yeah!

You turn my head around
Turn me upside down
You turn my head around
Blew my mind... 69 times
Yeah...

You got me 69 times...
Why you want to go and break my heart? Yeah!
You blew my mind... 69 times
Boy and girls up on the floor just sing till you can't no more
You turn my head around you turn me upside down
Yeah! 69 times...
Yeah! Yeah!
You turn my head around you turn me upside down
Yeah! 69 times...
Sing!
La la la...
69 times...
Oh... she did not know
She broke my hear, she broke my heart, she broke my heart!
Did I hear ya say she broke your heart?
You heard me right Grace Slick, you heard me right
Oh yeah!
You got me falling...
