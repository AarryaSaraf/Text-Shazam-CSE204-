Today my love is like a raging storm
The emptiness surrounds me, and I am torn and lost
Within the realm that you are gone
Drowning am I in a pool of tears
To think that for years to come
I must live alone without you
The only one I've ever loved
And in the night my heart must reminisce
And I savor each memory of you
Like a fine wine
It is said that time will heal the wounds of all men
As for me there is no time and no cure
For the love you gave was pure
Until this day the gods have not forgiven me for betraying you
And you, do you lie awake at night with thoughts of me in your head?
Is there another lover, a stranger beside you in your bed?
To take the place of me
These words and thoughts from me to you
Will come and go in space and time
And I'll never forget that once you were mine
If saying come back will bring you here
I'd say come back my dear
As for now my love is like a storm today
