How could you leave me
Why did you have to say goodbye?
You should know better
Now all I do is sit and cry

How could you do it
After the changes we've been through
Look at me jonesin'
I'm still so much hung up on you

And everytime I see you
Undress me with your eyes
And everytime I touch you
I'm so hypnotized

Don't you understand I'm
Hypnotized by you
Hey baby, you got me hypnotized, yeah
And you put a spell on me
I'll never be free, no I'll never be free

What is this magic
What is this feeling you possess? (you possess)
Tell me your potion
A mixture of all your tenderness (tenderness, tenderness)

Was it your kisses
Or was it the way you held me tight? (so tight)
This strange obsession
Has you in my fantasy each night (oh baby)

And everytime I see you
Undress me with your eyes
And everytime I touch you
I'm so hypnotized

Don't you understand I'm
Hypnotized by you
Hey baby, you got me hypnotized, yeah

And everytime I see you
Undress me with your eyes
And everytime I touch you
I'm so hypnotized

Don't you understand I'm
Hypnotized by you
Hey baby, you're always on my mind

I think about you all the time, girl
Think about you all the time
I'll never be free, no I'll never be free

Hypnotized
Hypnotized by you, hypnotized
Hypnotized by you, I'm hypnotized, baby
Hypnotized by you, I'm hypnotized
Hypnotized by you
Hypnotized
Hypnotized
Hypnotized
Hypnotized
