Looking at the little piggies strutting in a row
Living in the shadows for a brother just to grow
Lying like a Devil, they stand waiting in a fire
Stuck inside a prison, walls of concrete and barbed wire
I never really ever thought I would make it out alive
They tried to keep me in a trick, so I would not survive
The Devil has a sneaky way of keeping a brother down
But now that I'm laughing in disgrace, I'm writing this one out

Somebody is watching
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching you, too
Somebody is watching
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching me, too
Yeah

To see there's really nothing, but a punk that's dressed in drag
(And you know that's right)
Their act is like a bunch of bitches, who are on the rag
(Yeah)
If anyone who's been there, can't relate to what I say
Now that I'm free, you see, I'm having it my way
(That's right)
So look at all the little piggies, standing in a row
Waiting in a shadows for a brother, just to glow
Lying like a Devil, they stand waiting in a fire
Stuck inside a prison, walls of concrete and barbed wire

Somebody is watching
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching me, too
Somebody is watching
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching me, too
Somebody is watching
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching me, too
Somebody is watching
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching you
Somebody is watching me, too

Horns, blow!
This summer's funky!
Stone City Band, dig it up! Uh!
We gotta keep it funky, yea!
Everybody sing!

Somebody's watching you (somebody is watching you)
Somebody's watching me, too (somebody is watching)
Somebody's watching you
Somebody's watching me, too (might be the police)
Somebody's watching you (just might be the government)
Somebody's watching me, too (just might be a sucker)
Somebody's watching you (or might be a buster)
Somebody's watching me, too (or it might be your parole)
Somebody's watching you (somebody is watching you)
Somebody's watching me, too (somebody)
Somebody's watching you (somebody is watching you)
Somebody's watching me, too
Somebody's watching you (somebody is watching you)
Somebody's watching me, too (somebody is watching you!)

Crack cell 7!

Alright Superfreak, grab your shit.
You're on parole... we'll be watching you, boy.
