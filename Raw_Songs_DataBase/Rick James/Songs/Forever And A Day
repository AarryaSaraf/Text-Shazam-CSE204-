Baby if you love me, come on girl and show me
Tell me what I must do
Got you where I want you, I love you girl it's only
Something I'm saying
Baby if you feel it, come on girl and meet
And give me what I desire
Lots of pretty presents I'll lay at your feet
Just let me turn on your fire, yeah

Baby, I think you and me could be together eternally
Forever and a night
Baby, I think you and me could be together eternally
Forever and a day
Baby, I think you and me could be together eternally
Forever and a night
Baby, I think you and me could be together eternally
Forever and a day

Baby if I give you, loving and a-kissing
Then maybe you'll understand
I've got all the treasures girl, that you've been missing
You need me to be your man
Baby, inspiration is something that you seek
In all that you say and do
The only limitation, is girl that I'm so weak
Whenever I look at you, yeah

Baby, I think you and me could be together eternally
Forever and a night
Baby, I think you and me could be together eternally
Forever and a day
Baby, I think you and me could be together eternally
Forever and a night
Baby, I think you and me could be together eternally
Forever and a day

Baby, forever!
Baby, forever!

Forever and a night
Forever and a day
Forever and a night
Forever and a day

Baby, I think you and me could be together eternally
And I mean that's forever and ever and ever
And I want you to know that I will be with you until the day I die
