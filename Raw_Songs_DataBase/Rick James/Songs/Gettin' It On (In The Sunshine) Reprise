Give me my guitar

Alright now, just gettin' it on, in the sunshine
Everybody sing it out
Just gettin' it on, just gettin' it on now
Shine, I wanna sing
Just gettin' it on, feeling good at night, in the sunshine
Everybody sing it out
Just gettin' it on, just gettin' it on now
Save me a glass of that, please
Just gettin' it on, in the sunshine
Fire up that thing over there
Just gettin' it on, just gettin' it on now
Okay, that's all, give me a hit, okay?
