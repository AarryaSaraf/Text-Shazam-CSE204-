So soft and gentle with her hazel eyes
So sentimental and she shows no despise
When I'm down and I'm troubled
She is always there in my times of despair
She's an angel in my life
And through all of these years
She'd never waste a tear
Wanna make the whole world pay attention
There is someone special in my life
Give the girl an honorable mention
When you talk of all the angels in the sky!
Heaven must have sent her, Hallelujah!
To be there even in my times of strife
She's really someone special in my life
She's my moon child!

Moon child 
She's my moon child!
Moon child 

Hey, Cancer lady, don't you know I understand?
There's no need to be lonely
I will always be your man
You cook and you labor with desires of your own
Just please remember
In my heart, in my life, you'll always have a home
Wanna make the whole world pay attention
Someone's very special in my life
Give this girl an honorable mention
When you talk of all the angels in the sky!
Heaven must have sent her, Hallelujah!
To be there even in my times of strife
She's really someone special in my life
She's my moon child!

Moon child 
She's my moon child!
Moon child 
Fancy dancer
Witty Cancer
Lovely lady
Never shady
She's mine!
