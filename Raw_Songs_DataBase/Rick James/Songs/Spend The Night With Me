She knew me
Such a long time ago
The only thing changed on me
Was my smile

She said
"How long before your show
And can I sit and talk to you for awhile?"
Oh yeah

She has fire in her eyes
She had moonlight lips and
Something strange and tantalizing

Told me
I could not resist her charms
Being locked up in her arms
Baby spend the night with me

Oh baby
Spend the night with me
Oh baby

She said
She came so far to see
If everything she heard
About me was true
Oh yeah

I said "A friend you'll always be"
Then she said
"I need something from you"
Oh baby

She had fire in here eyes
She had moonlight lips and
Something strange and tantalizing

Told me
I could not resist her charms
I'd be wrapped up in her arms
Baby spend the night with me

Tonight
It will be another night for love

Baby, tonight
It's alright
Let us share another night for love

Baby, tonight
It's so tight
It must be another night for love

Baby, tonight
It's so tight
Let us share another night of love
Baby spend the night with me

Oh baby, oh baby
Baby spend the night with me
Oh baby

Spend the night with me, baby
We'll make love for a million years

Spend the night with me, baby
You'll never cry another tear
For years and years and years
And years

Spend the night
Spend the night with me, baby
Spend the night
Spend the night with me, baby
