The time has come for me my darling, darling
To express the love for you I have inside my heart
And even as the sea makes its way to the shore
So will I make my way to you
Our love possesses not, nor would our love be possessed
And in the sweetness of loving you I have found joy
So 'till life's end you will always be my lover and my friend

I feel for you
As my lady and my lover
I really do, I really do
Feel this way for you

I want to say
You're my sole life's inspiration
Don't ever leave
Don't ever go baby
No never my love
Never my love

Oh, I believe in you, baby, baby
Oh, just believe in me too, girl
Oh, I believe in you, baby
Oh just believe in me too, girl
Believe in me

I feel for you
As my lady and my lover (and my friend)
I really do, I really do
Feel this way again

I want to say (I want to say)
You're my sole life's inspiration
Don't ever leave
Don't ever go baby
No never my love
Never my love

Oh, I believe in you, baby, baby
Oh, just believe in me too, girl
Oh, I believe in you, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
