Frankie was a brother
And his skin was just as dark as night
Suzy was a sister
And just coloured pretty Suzey, very white

They met in a nightclub
Somewhere in the year of '89
Suzy told her girl friends
"Well I think that colored boy is really fine"
Oh yeah

They look so wild and crazy, yeah
Check them out and see, yeah
I think I'll let the walls down to my prison
Let my heart go free, yeah

Now wanna get wild and crazy, yeah
Don't care what people say, naw
Step into the dark side of the rainbow

What I'll do is right
Just a silly game of Black and White
Be it together

Talkin' about Black and White
Black and White
Be it together

Talkin' about Black and White
What color you are

Oh say, can you see (can you see)
Just what color you are (just what color that you are)
Black, yellow or white (black or white)
Everybody is a star (everybody is a star)

Frankie looked at Suzy
And he caught her staring in his eyes
Suzy's girl friends told her
What was happening just wasn't very wise, now
Oh no

If it was another world
They'd met each other face to face
No one ever heard the conversation
That was taking place
Oh no

Do you wanna get wild and crazy, yeah
Maybe take a chance, yeah
If the talk that they may talk about us
May I have this dance, baby

Do you wanna get wild and crazy, yeah
Break the silly rules, yeah
Maybe if we get to know each other

Groove out all the fools 
Bring it to the light
Cause when you break it down
It's just silly games of Black and White

Be it together
Talkin' about Black and White
Black and White
Be it together
Talkin' about Black and White

So just stand and be proud (be proud)
Sing a song, sing it loud (sing it soft and sing it loud)
Bring the truth to the light (bring it to the light)
Come together black and white (come together, come together)

("Calling people of the world") come together
("Black boys, white girls") come together
("I have a dream") come together
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Come together ("black boys, white girls")
Come together ("calling people of the world")
Come together ("as sisters and brothers")
("I have a dream") Come together now!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Black and white
("I had a dream today")

Come together
