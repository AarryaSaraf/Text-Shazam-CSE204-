Girl when push comes to shove and it's me you want to love
Come
Don't be afraid to hesitate, I won't hurt you or make you wait
If you come
Do you wanna get off this good time feelin'
That I got and got alot
Something deep inside tells me you're reelin'
Burnin' hot, you're burnin' hot

Don't you know that I'm the one
Knockin' on your door
Beggin' you for more
Come on baby, say that
Come into my life
Come on baby
It could be so nice
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(C - O - M - E)

Tell me, how do you like my funk?

Girl when you're lonely in the night and you need a love that's right
Mama come
I will be there quick in a flash, even bring my private stash
If you come
Do you ever wonder why it's better comin' than to go?
Then tell me so
Don't you know I hate to see you runnin' 
Cause then you blow and that's a no no

Don't you know that I'm the one
Knockin' on your door
Beggin' you for more
Come on baby
Come into my life
Come on baby
That could be so nice
Come on baby, baby
Come into my life
Come on baby
That could be so nice
Come on baby
