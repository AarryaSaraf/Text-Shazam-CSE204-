I have known so many girls
In my time and space
Every color, every size
In the human race

When I first laid eyes on you
I was quite alone
Met you thru a friend of mine
Dinner at my home

Oh Judy, what am I to do
Judy, I'm still in love with you
Judy, you're so sweet and fine
Judy, always on my mind

Judy, you're a special girl
And this I understand
One day I will rock your world
Just let me be your man

If and when we meet again
I hope you're still the same
Until then girl, all I do
Is simply call your name

Oh Judy, what am I to do
Judy, I'm still in love with you
Judy, you're so sweet and fine, baby
Judy, always on my mind, baby
Judy, you're a part of me
Judy, girl you set me free, baby

Baby, baby, work
Judy, Judy
I still love you
Judy, Judy
