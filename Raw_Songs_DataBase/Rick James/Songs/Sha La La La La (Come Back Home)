Each man who sees you
Wants to share your love
I guess you're just
A fantasy of mine

And everytime I think
Of you and I
I feel a rush
All lover my body

I'm not the kind of man
Who acts so shy
When I want someone
My heart won't deny

It's more than you I want, girl
Don't you see?
More than your love, girl
More than your body

Sha la la la la
Baby, please come back home
Sha la la la la
'Cause I love you so
I love you so

Sha la la la la
Baby, please come back home
Sha la la la la
I love you so
Sha la la la la
Baby, please come back home
Sha la la la la
I love you so
Sha la la la la
Baby, please come back home
Sha la la la la
I love you so
Don't you know that?

Just yesterday i woke
And found you gone
Left with a memory
That's so divine

As if we didn't make love
All night long
So saying goodbye
Girl, only made me cry

I'm not the kind of man
Who wants to be alone
My heart was yours, girl
Yes , it was your home

And as I lay here, girl
I think of you
Hoping so you'll call
Give me your all and all
This time

Sha la la la la
Baby, please come back home
Sha la la la la
I love you so
I love you so
I love you so

Don't you know that?
Don't you know that?
You should know that

Sha la la la (Baby, please come home)
Sha la la la la la la la (Baby, please come home)

Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la
