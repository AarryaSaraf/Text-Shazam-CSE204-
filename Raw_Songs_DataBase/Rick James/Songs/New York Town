Wow, New York City
I need a cap
Yo - taxi!
Thanks a lot, man, for picking me up

Where are you going, buddy?

Ohhm, bring me up to 125th street, Lexington Avenue, man

Nah, no way, I am sorry, man, I ain't going up there

What do you mean, you sorry, you can't take me up there?

Ah no, get outta my cab, I am not going into Harlem

What do you mean?
You can't leave me in the middle of the street in Manhattan
Just like that
Wow, is this a trick?
Better call me another cab
Yo - taxi!
I hope it's a brother this time

When I want to get down, I go to New York town
There I can party all night
When I walk in the door that's where you've been before
The freaks are there to give me delight
The Ladies there are everywhere
And we party from night time 'till dawn
Then I get up at 10 and do it all again
I could never stop getting it on

People rushing
Uptown, under the ground
The subways, to Manhattan in old New York
(New York town)
People hurry
Why should they have to hurry?
There's always a party in old New York
(New York town)

When I want to get high, up on my jet I'll fly
To the city where you never come down
I walk in Central Park, but never after dark
'Cause you never know who's hanging around
The Puerto Rican girls, their hair is curled
And the sisters are as fine as can be
Even the girls are a trick, they say was half as slick
And it's the only place where you can be free

People rushing
Uptown, under the ground
The subways, to Manhattan in old New York
(New York town)
People hurry
Why should they have to hurry?
There's always a party in old New York
(New York town)
People rushing
Uptown, under the ground
The subways, to Manhattan in old New York
(New York town)
People hurry
Why should they have to hurry?
There's always a party in old New York
(New York town)

(Ohh, uhh)
New York
Wow: New York
New York
New York City, New York
New York
Well, New York
New York
New York
Yeah, New York
New York
New York City, New York
Yeah, yeah
