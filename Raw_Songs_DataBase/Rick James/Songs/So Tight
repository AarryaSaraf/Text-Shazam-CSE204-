You got no money in your pockets
No shoes on your feet
Every place that you go
You can't afford to eat

Get a job, get a job
Get fired on the spot
Cause you don't think you can make it
You don't think that you're hot

Girls don't play when
They don't think they have time
Just to loosen up their bodies
Just relax their minds

So they game and they hustle
And trick into a bag
Ain't it sad you got to do it
Baby ain't it just a drag

So tight
Trying to make it on the streets
So tight
Trying to make ends meet
So tight
For the little boys and girls
Loosen up, loosen up
Party 'round the world, oh

Tight
Party 'round the world
Party 'round the world
Tight

Everybody wants to rap
All the suckers wanna sing
Cause they think it's all so easy
To do most anything

So you get yourself an agent
Put some gold around your neck
Then you strut in your Adidas
And say boy what the heck

All the money becomes
Easy cause now you're on the top
And as soon as you start blowin'
That's when the money stops

All the girls in the world
Are there at your command
They'll do anything you want
As long as they can understand

So tight
Trying to make it on the streets
So tight
Trying to make ends meet
So tight
For the little boys and girls
Loosen up, loosen up
And party 'round the world

So tight
Trying to make it on the streets
So tight
Trying to make ends meet
So tight
For the little boys and girls
Loosen up, loosen up
And party 'round the world, oh

Tight
Party 'round the world
Tight

What if all the people (what if all the people)
All around the world (all around the world)
All got together as one
There would be a party to remember, oh yeah

What if all the music (what if all the music)
All around the world (all around the world)
We all got together and sang
There would be some harmony forever, oh yeah

So tight
Trying to make it on the streets
So tight
Trying to make ends meet
So tight
Even the little boys and girls
Loosen up, loosen up
And party 'round the world, oh

Tight
Party 'round the world
That makes you
Tight
Party 'round the world
Tight
Party 'round the world, oh
That makes you
Tight
Party 'round the world
