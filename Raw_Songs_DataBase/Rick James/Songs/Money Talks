When you're out walkin'
and money's talkin'
Just stop and listen
to what's it's sayin'

Don't need a dollar
to be a scholar
Drop all your money
and don't you holler

When you hold the cash
and the dough
and those greenback dollars go
Money's walkin', money's walkin'

People need to eat
To put shoes
on their little baby's feet
That's money talkin', yeah


yeay yeah yeah
Oh Yeah
Money Talkin
yeay yeah yeah
Oh Yeah

Ronnie ran for President
Because he wants to control
where the money's spent

What about the war and destitute
Well, they don't matter
They do not compute

What about the blacks
and the whites
and the reds are so uptight
Cause money's walkin', money's walkin'

Taxes rising high
Till my cup
Is so empty I could cry
Money's talkin', yeah

Money talkin' loud and clear
in my ear

She works the corner
of Twelfth and Vine
Making her tax free money
pinching every dime

She has to hustle
to make ends meet
Even a workin' lady
finds it hard to eat

What will be the deal
in the end
if to live we've got to steal
But the money's walkin', money's walkin'

Ronnie find the cure
this is just too much for us to endure
That's freakin' talkin', yeah
