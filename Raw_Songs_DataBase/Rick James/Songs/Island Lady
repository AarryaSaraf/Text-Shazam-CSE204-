My Lady of the Island
You kept me warm on tropic nights
Kept me smilin'
Your naked body lying on the sand
Lady of the Island
I'm your man
I love you and you know it
Like the waves that kiss the sand you somehow show it
Here on your island I would love to stay
Like a bird too soon I'll fly away
When I say I'm leaving you it breaks my heart
'Cause you know I wanna stay with you forever
Your love is fine, time after time
And I savor every sip and every swallow
Your brown-skinned body lying on the sand
Lady of the Islands I'm your man
Lady of the Islands understand
Leaving you breaks my heart
