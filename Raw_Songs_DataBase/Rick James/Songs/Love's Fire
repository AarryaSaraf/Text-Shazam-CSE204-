Love's fire
Love's fire

In the heat of passion baby
The middle of the night, yeah
Fingers start to movin', movin' mama
Something feels so right, yeah baby

And in the midst of pleasure
The sounds of silence die, yeah
Whisper that you love me
(Tell me baby, in a lover's cry)

I can feel your
Love's fire
Really burning me now, baby yeah
Love's fire

Got me burning up, got me burning up, girl
Got me burning up, got me burning up, girl
Got me burning
Got me burning up, got me burning up
Got me burning
Got me burning up, got me burning up
Got me burning

In the land of lovin' baby
You and I are there, yeah
Never push and shoving, never baby
That's how much we care, yeah baby

I really love your body, baby
I really love your mind, yeah
And everytime I love you down, baby
That's when I know you're mine

I can feel your
Love's fire
Really burning me up, baby burn me up
Love's fire

Got me burning up, got me burning up

Feel so good
Feels so nice to know, baby
Feel so good
Feels so nice to know
You're mine, all mine

Feel so good
Feels so nice to know
You're mine, all mine

Feels so good
Feels so nice, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're a classical case of burning love

Ooh baby
