She was lonely, looking for someone
I was all that she thought I'd be
She was wanting something special
I thought it might as well be me

Come to my house, come to my room
We'll have dinner and I'll serve thee
Something sensual, deep in her eyes
Somehow I knew she wanted me, yeah

Are you experienced?
Whoa...
Are you experienced, sexually?

Are you?
Are you experienced?
Are you?
Are you?

She was watching, I was waiting
And we both knew, what was to come
Stop this waiting, anticipating
Let's relax girl, and have some fun

Come to my arms, come to my lips
Let me teach you with every move
Bodies swaying, fingers playing
It's so easy, just relax and groove, yeah

Are you experienced?
Whoa...
Are you experienced, sexually?

Are you?
Are you experienced?
Are you?
Are you?
Are you?
Are you?

Girl there's no doubt inside my mind
That if we spend a minute's time
I'll bring more feelings out of you
Than you have ever known
I don't boast or brag and this you know
I don't claim to be no Romeo or a Casanova Brown
But girl, I can throw down

Are you experienced?
Whoa...
Are you experienced, sexually?

Are you?
Are you experienced?
Are you?
Are you, sexu-
Are you?
Are you?
Are you?
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Are you?
Are you?
Are you?

Are you experienced?
Have you ever been... experienced?
