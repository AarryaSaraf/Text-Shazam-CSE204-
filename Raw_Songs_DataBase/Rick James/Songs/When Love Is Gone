Girl you're old enough to know the way your life should be
Why then do you always ask your mother and me?
Chances are our future's are over said and done
The battle now is over and the war I have won
Think that over
While you're lying in your sleep at night
You and me we could have made it baby, baby
But you walked out of my life

Now my love is gone
Now my love is gone
Now my love is gone
Now my love is gone

Girl, I see no further reason for me to carry on
This will be the last time I write to you in song
My heart's an open secret your love has closed the door
It's over
Like the time that's passed away til' now
How much longer will I suffer baby, baby
Must I bear this pain and smile

Now my love is gone, gone, gone, gone
It's gonna be hard to carry on
Look at me baby
Haven't you ever seen a grown man cry
Don't it look funny, sugar
Watchin' tears fall from his eyes
Yes indeed I cry, cry


(When your love is gone)
(When your love is gone)
[It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone)
(it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone)
I When your love is gone)
(When your love is gone)
(It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone)'
(It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone)
(When your love is gone)
(When your love is gone)
(It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone)
(It's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone)
Girl, to see my life without you is more than I can stand
Picture me an empty hollow shell of a man
Caged within, a feelin' that one day you'll return
Knowing that can never be, my flesh starts to burn
Don't you care baby?
Don't you even feel the pain and hurt
I'm goin' through
If you really, really, really cared baby, baby
You'd know what I'm goin' through

Now my love is gone
Gonna be so hard to carry on
Look at me baby
Haven't you ever seen a grown man cry?
Don't it look funny sugarÂ ?

Watchin' tears fall from his eyes
Won't you tell me why
Oh why
Oh why
Oh why has it gone
