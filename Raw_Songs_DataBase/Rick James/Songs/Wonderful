Ow!
Ow!
Ow!

I've got a story
I think you outta know
I missed you baby
I thought I'd tell you so

I've been so lonely, girl
Since you've been away
Now that you're back
All that I can say is

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful

I missed the kisses
All over you would place
The gentle touches
You lay upon my face

The sweet romancing
We make into the night
All your good loving
Would surely make it all right

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful

Here I am baby (here I am baby)
Standing right in front of you (standing right in front of you)
Telling everyone I see (telling everyone I see)
Your love is wonderful to me (your love is wonderful to me, baby)

Wonderful

I've got a secret
I think I outta share
I've had some lovers
But never really cared

I've waited for you
To come back to my world
This time forever
You'll never leave me girl

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful

To be united
Is all I want to do
I'm so delighted
Cause now I'm back with you

I've really missed you
I thought I'd tell you so
Your love was freshest
Your love is wonderful

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful

Here I am baby (here I am baby)
Standing right in front of you (standing right in front of you)
Telling everyone I see (telling everyone I see)
Your love is wonderful to me (your love is wonderful to me)

Here I am baby (here I am baby)
Standing right in front of you (standing right in front of you)
Telling everyone I see (telling everyone I see)
Your love is wonderful to me (your love is wonderful to me)

Your love is wonderful
Your love is wonderful
Your love is wonderful

Here I am baby (here I am baby)
Standing right in front of you (standing right in front of you)
Telling everyone I see (telling everyone I see)
Your love is wonderful to me (your love is wonderful to me)
