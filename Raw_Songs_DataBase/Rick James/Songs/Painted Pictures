Love is not a color
You can paint black or white, no, no
Picture that in your mind

Love is not a feeling
That you let go to at night, no, no
Picture that in your mind

You can play the game, you're so strong
You can say you're right when you're wrong
Still your life is just painted pictures

You can laugh when you want to cry
Say hello when you mean goodbye
Still your life is just painted pictures

Painted pictures, painted pictures
Painted pictures, painted pictures

Love is not a candle
That you turn on like a light, no, no
Picture that in your mind

Love is not a collar
You can call wrong or right, no, no
Picture that in your mind

You can give the things you don't have
You can lose the things that you love
Still your life is just painted pictures

You can play you're straight when you're not
You can say you're cold when you're hot
Still your life is just painted pictures

You can play you're good when you're bad
You can say you're glad when you're sad
Still your life is just painted pictures

You can lose when you want to win
You can die and be born again
Still your life is just painted pictures

Painted pictures, painted pictures
Painted pictures, painted pictures

You can play the game, you're so strong
You can say you're right when you're wrong
Still your life is just painted pictures

You can laugh when you want to cry
Say hello when you mean goodbye
Still your life is just painted pictures
