Mary say she wanna just be happy
And she doesn't want to be let down
Make her smile and make her happy
And that's all you have to do to keep her 'round
I would take you Mary
Anywhere you want to go
On my private Lear jet
We could fly to Mexico
Lay 'round in the grass
Make love on the sand
You could be my lady
I could be your man
Mary get down, Mary-Go-Round, yeah
Mary-Go-Round and round and round and round
Mary-Go-Round, yeah
Mary say she doesn't wanna be lonely
I could never do that in a million years
I don't tease her, I just please her
And in that way I don't have to see her tears
Hey Mary, baby, let's go to Paris, France
And by the Champs Elysees we could make romance
Make love and dine and wine
We'd have a good time
Your wish is my command,
Girl, I'm your biggest fan
Mary get down
Mary-Go-Round, yeah
Mary-Go-Round and round and round and round
Mary-Go-Round, yeah
Mary wanna dance
And Mary wanna sing
Mary wanna love me and everything
Mary wanna dance and Mary wanna sing
Mary wanna make love and everything
Mary do you wanna roll around
Mary do you wanna roll around
Mary do you wanna roll around
Or do you just wanna get on down
She likes it up and down
She likes it in and out
Give it up for Funk
Just give it up for funk
