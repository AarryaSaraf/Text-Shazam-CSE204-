I know this chick, her name is Loosey
She's a freaky thang, yeah
He legs are long and her lips are juicy
You ought to hear what friends have to say about

Loosey's rap!
I said, Loosey's rap!
Loo-se-y's rap!

She don't scream and she don't holla
She don't make a sound, naw!
I have taught her like a scholar
She knows what to do
When my love comes down, I say

Loosey's rap!
I said, Loosey's rap!
Lotta, lotta, lotta, lotta
Loosey's rap!
Loo-se-y's rap!

They call me Loosey, 'cause I'm so loose
I make all the right moves, when I seduce
Your mind, your body, your soul, I will capture
Tell ya I'm so good that you will have to
Lose control, become infatuated
For something exotic, erotic and x-rated

Now the way I act and the words I speak
Make people think that I'm a super freak
Well I am what I am
And I does what I do
How would you like for me to freak you?!
