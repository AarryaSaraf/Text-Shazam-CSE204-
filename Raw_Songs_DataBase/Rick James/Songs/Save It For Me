Saving all your wealth and money
Waiting for a rainy day
In the Land of Milk and Honey
It never really goes that way
What about your inspiration
You do it on your own free time
You're under investigation
But it's only in your mind (in your mind)

Ooh, save it for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, save it for me, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, save it for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, save it for me, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah

Met a lot of girls in Paris
I took them all to London Town
Then took a plane to New York City
'Cause there I know I could get down
Your girl was busy making movies
Somewhere down in old L.A.
She told me she could really love you
And boy that's when you ran away

You said ooh, save it for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, save it for me, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I said girl, save it for me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You say ooh, save it for me, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

You said ooh, ooh, ooh...

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Save it for me, baby!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Save it for me please, girl
Save it all my love
Save it all my love, for you

Sing!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Sing!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah
