(We want Rick to funk us up.)
(We want Rick to funk us up.)

Hey
Yeah, yeah
Hey

(Hey everyone, tonight we're gonna have fun.)
What you want us to do with the funk?
(Fire it up.)
(Hey everyone, tonight we're gonna have fun.)
What do you want us to do with the funk?
(Fire it up.)

If funky music makes you groove
And you just can't wait to move
And getting off is what you've come here for
Then there's no need to hesitate
Cause you know I hate to wait
I'll funk you til' you roll on out the door.



(So wave the funk sign in the air.)
And show me that you care
You've been sitting on your booty much too long
(We'll funk you, but don't go nowhere.)
If you say it's fun
Then fire up cause the show has just begun

(Hey everyone tonight we're gonna have fun.)
What you want us to do with the funk?
(Fire it up.)
Hey everyone tonight we're gonna have fun.)
What you want us to do with the funk?
(Fire it up)
Blow
(Hey......)

Now don't just sit there in your chairs
Actin' like L-seven squares
Freak on out, that's what this song's about
(Funk is for the young and old)
I know you have been told

Don't ever get too hip to sing and shout now
I haven't come to bring you down
Or to turn your head around
Or to tell you what you should or should not do
(Funk was made to get you high.)

That's no alibi
Do what you want, it's all left up to you
Yeah
(Hey everyone tonight we're gonna have fun.)
What you want us to do with the funk?
(Fire it up.)

(Hey everyone tonight we're gonna have fun.)
What you want us to do with the funk?
(Fire it up.)
(People get up and dance to the music.)
(People get up.)
(People get up.)
(People get up.)
(People get up and dance to the music.)
(People get up.)
(People get up.)
(People get up.)
(Hey......)
Yeah
(Hey......)
What you want us to do with the funk?
(Fire it up.)
What you want us to do with the funk?
(Fire it up.)
Say fire it up
(Fire it up.)
Say fire it up
(Fire it up.)
Say fire it up
(Fire it up.)
Fire it up.
