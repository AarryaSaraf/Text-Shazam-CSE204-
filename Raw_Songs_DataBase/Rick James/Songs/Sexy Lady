Funk on!

Now, there's a girl on the street
And she walks by, tries to meet you
If you're by sometime, well
She's looking good! My, my, my
Lookin' fine, well

Now, there's a man on the block
And he's checking for some money
How his money's long, yeah
He's talking trash! Well
Talking cash, y'all (cash-money, that is)

She said "you've got the time"
He said "where is the money?"
She said "life was no good"
He said "stop talking funny"
She said "here is your breeze"
He said "baby don't you be so mean
I love you, sexy lady
I love you, sexy lady"

Now, there's a girl, that I know
How she loves to cop-and-blow whenever I'm around, well
She keeps me up, well
Never down, y'all

She loves the lamps and to dance
And she says I'm treating romance just to past the time, yeah
I love her body! No, no, no
Love her mind, y'all

She said "you've got the time"
He said "where is the money?"
She said "life was no good"
He said "stop talking funny"
She said "here is your breeze"
He said "baby don't you be so mean
I love you, sexy lady
I love you, sexy lady"

Horns!...
