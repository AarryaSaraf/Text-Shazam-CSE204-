Sexy, fine

Sexy, sexy, sexy...

You are my life, you are my love
You are my everything
You make me high when I am down
You make me laugh and sing
Come as you want, come as you are
Girl come into my life
You are my girl, my number one star
I might make you my wife

Sweet and sexy thing
Girl come into my life
Sweet and sexy thing
And I'll never leave you
Sweet and sexy thing
Say you will be my girl
Sweet and sexy thing
I won't decieve you
Sexy thing

Sexy, sexy, sexy

You are my card, you are my game
You are my ace in the hold
With you in my deck, I never can lose
If I might sound too bold
Do as you want, do as you will
I trust you with all my heart
And when you are through, I'll be there with you
And that's when the real love starts

Sweet and sexy thing
Girl come into my life
Sweet and sexy thing
I'll never leave you, leave you
Sweet and sexy thing
Say you will be my girl
Sweet and sexy thing
I won't decieve you

Sweet and sexy thing
Say you will be my girl
Sweet and sexy thing
And I'll never leave you, leave you
Sexy thing

Sexy thing, I love you 
I love you
