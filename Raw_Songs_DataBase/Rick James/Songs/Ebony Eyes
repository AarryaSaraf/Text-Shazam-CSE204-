Wind in your hair
Sun on your skin
You're looking good, girl
All over again

Hey there, Miss Brown
I want you to know I love you

You're brown as the sand
You're soft as the shore
You're leaving me hungry
I'm crying for more

Ooh, whee, baby, girl
You're such a score
And I want you to know that
You know what, girl

I love you
I bet you didn't know that, girl
You didn't know that
I need you
Right now, baby, right now, baby
And I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

Lips soft and tender
Ready to speak
Her voice says, I love you (I love you)
And it's making me weak

Hey there, little girl
May I just say I love you
Tell 'em how you feel, Rick

Love is the brown skin
Girl in my eyes
Think it's time that I told you
Don't you realize

You're such a queen, woman
Woman, you're such a prize
And I want you to know that
You know what, girl

I love you
And I bet you didn't know that, girl
You didn't know that
I need you
Right now, baby, right now, baby
And I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

I love you ebony eyes, oh, my
I need you, woman
I need you (ooh...)
Oh, and I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

I really love you (ooh...), woman, I love you (love you)
Ebony eyes (ooh...), oh, my
I wanna say that I need you (ooh...), honey, I need you
And I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

Ebony eyes (woo...)
Ebony eyes, oh, my (hoo...)
Ebony eyes (hoo...)
Girl, and I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

Love you (love you, love you)
Ebony eyes
