Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

I've been through a few ladies
In my life and times
But never met nobody
Sweet as you, oh no

I feel so good about you
Thought I'll throw my line
And wouldn't you know?
I caught you, baby

Now that it's over, all over
I wanna do it all again
Taught me so many sweet things
I pray this feeling won't end

Ooohh...
Show me the way you make love
Show me and teach me, teach me, teach me tonight

Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

I've been through a few changes
In my life and in my mind
I never thought I'd have
Someone like you baby

I searched so long to find love
Now my search is through
And well, well, well
I found you baby

Now that it's over, all over
I wanna do it all again
Taught me so many sweet things
I pray this feeling won't end

Ooohh...
Show me the way you make love
Show me and teach me tonight

Oh girl
Show me the way you make love
Darling show me and teach me, teach me, teach me tonight

Hold it right there
I like it, right there

Well...
Well, well, well,
Well, well, well...
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah

I love you so much
So much...
