Anything and, everything and
Anything and, everything and
Anything and, everything and

Everyone in the world thinks I'm crazy
Cause of all the things I'd do for you
But if the world thinks I'm crazy, I don't mind
I'll do what I got to do

Steal, break stuff, sting, I'll shoot someone to deliver
Anything your heart desires
Rob, play, cry, buy, take and pull the trigger
If it means I will keep you by my side

Girl, there's nothing I won't do for you
Anything and everything
Girl, there's nothing I won't do for you
I'll stand and deliver

Girl, there's nothing I won't do for you
Anything and everything
Girl, there's nothing I won't do for you
Stand and deliver

Anything and, everything and
Anything and, everything you want
Anything and, everything and
Anything and, everything you want

Everyone that I know, says "forget it"
And it's just a waste of time
But they just don't understand I can't quit it
Girl, I got to make you mine

Rob, steal, beg, deal, do everything that I gotta
Just to keep you close to me
Pay, bray, leave, stay, anything that you wanna
Just say you'll stay, and maybe be with me

Girl, there's nothing I won't do for you
Anything and everything
Girl, there's nothing I won't do for you
I'll stand and deliver

Girl, there's nothing I won't do for you
Anything and everything
Girl, there's nothing I won't do for you
I'll stand and deliver

Girl, there's nothing I won't do for you
Anything and everything
Girl, there's nothing I won't do for you
I'll stand and deliver

Anything and, everything and
Anything and, everything you want
Anything and, everything and
Anything and, everything you want

Anything and, everything and
Anything and, everything and
Anything and, everything and...
