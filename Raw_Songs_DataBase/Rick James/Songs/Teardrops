(Teardrops are falling from your eyes
Teardrops are falling, teardrops are falling
Teardrops are falling from your eyes
Teardrops are falling, teardrops are falling)

A teardrop fell from my eyes yesterday
Letting me know I was not to be to cry
Although I asked the girl "please go away"
Should I be a man and just apologize?

I was all so wrong (baby, you were so wrong)
Hiding my foolish pride (hiding behind your pride)
Over and over again

Now the teardrops are falling (falling, falling, falling)
They are falling
Now my girl is gone away
Teardrops are falling (falling, falling, falling)
They are falling
But my girl is gone to stay

A teardrop fell from my eyes yesterday
Suddenly there was an emptiness inside
To lose a precious love like yours that way
And feeling such pain that brought teardrops to my eyes

I was all so wrong (baby, you were so wrong)
Hiding behind my foolish pride (hiding behind your pride)
Over and over again

Now the teardrops are falling (falling, falling, falling)
They are falling
Cause my girl is gone away
Teardrops are falling (falling, falling, falling)
They are falling
Cause my girl is gone to stay

Blow baby
Blow Danny

You know it takes a very, very special kind of man
To admit to his woman that he's been wrong
I've lost many ladies in my life
And through losing I've learned one thing
That you must be honest with the one you love

When you lose the one you love
And the teardrops start to fall
Don't hesitate or even wait
Say you love her, thinking of her
Give the one you love, your all in all
All and in all, all in all
Give her all the love you've got

(Teardrops are falling from your eyes
Teardrops are falling, teardrops are falling
Falling...)
