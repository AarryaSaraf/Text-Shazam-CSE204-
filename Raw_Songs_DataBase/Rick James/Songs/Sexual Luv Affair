Oh baby, let your luv come out
I can see by the deep look in your eyes girl
You need more than just an invitation
So here's your chance girl
Come and get your ya-ya's

You need more than just a boyfriend baby
Or just some man who wants to
Sit and hold your hand

You need a sexual luv affair
That's what you need baby
You need a sexual luv affair

Give it to me baby, give it to me baby

Oh baby, stop your foolin' 'round
You know I've had my eyes on you, yeah
It won't take much to put you down
On what you know girl we really got to do, yeah

I'll be your boyfriend and your lover
You will meet no other
That will do the things I do

You need a sexual luv affair
That's what you need baby
You need a sexual luv affair
Give it to me baby
You need a sexual luv affair

Ooh baby
It's got to be a sexual love affair, baby
It's got to be, got to be, sexual baby

Oh baby, let your luv come out
I can see by the deep look in your eyes girl
You need more than just an invitation
So here's your chance girl
Come and get your ya-ya's

Come and get your ya-ya's
Come and get your ya-ya's
Come and get your ya-ya's
You need a sexual luv affair
Come and get your ya-ya's
You need a sexual luv affair, baby

Ooh, baby...

Come and get your ya-ya's
You need a sexual luv affair
Come and get your ya-ya's
You need a sexual luv affair, darling
That's what you need, girl
