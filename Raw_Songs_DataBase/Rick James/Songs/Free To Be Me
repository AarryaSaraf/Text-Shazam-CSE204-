I'm up, down, middle of my room
Someone got excited, someone dropped the spoon
A joke, a smoke, I'm crawling on my knees
I'm feeling paranoia, someone rock it, please

A place, a space, any box will do
Just don't let the sun in, please, until I'm through
A room, a tomb, with all those doctors there
Asking crazy questions, aren't they well aware?

I'm free to be me
I'm wild as a cat, busy as a bee
Free to be me
I do what I choose, I done paid my dues
I'm free to be me
Ask me why I dare, I'll say I don't care
I'm free to be me
Until the end of time, I'll say what's on my mind, baby

Day and night, there's always someone there
Watching like an angel, do angels really care?
I stand, I fall, just one day at a time
I keep my life together, but I can change my mind

I love, I lust, but even more I care
Sex is not a fashion, something that you wear
The truth, the lies, I hear them all the time
Coming from a stranger, a real good friend of mine

I'm free to be me
I'm wild as a cat, busy as a bee
Free to be me
I do what I choose, I done paid my dues

You can say what you feel
I paid dues to be for real
I can afford to wave my freak flag high

Free to be me
A funky millionaire, my God has placed me there
Free to be me
When I'm on the down, He brings me back around, baby

Free! Free! Free!
Sing it to me, baby-baby-baby-baby...
Free!

Free!...
