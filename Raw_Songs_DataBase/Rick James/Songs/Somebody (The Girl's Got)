The girl's really fine
And she likes me good and plenty
She gives me love
Behind my four walls
At night

She's really hot
She understands my problems
She never stops
Giving me her all and all
Oh yeah

She's really hot
She's got somebody
Oh yeah
Girl's got alot
Mind, body and all
Hear me talkin' to ya baby?

Girl's really hot
She's got somebody
Oh yeah
She's got alot
Mind, body and all

She was in love
And she was deserted
He was the fool
Leaving her all alone
Oh yeah

I came along
All her pain that hurted
I kissed away
And made
Her weak heart strong
Oh yeah

She's a mystery to me
And the man who set her free
Was a fool

But that's the way
The story goes
When you love
Nobody follows any rules
Yeah

She's as sweet as cherry pie
She's the apple of my eye
She's my lover

She's got somebody
Oh baby
Girl's got somebody
She's got somebody
Oh baby
Girl's got somebody
She's got somebody
Oh baby
Girl's got somebody

She's really hot
She's got somebody
Oh yeah
Girl's got alot
Mind, body and all
She's really hot
She's got somebody
Oh yeah
Girl's got alot
Mind, body and all
Somebody
Somebody
