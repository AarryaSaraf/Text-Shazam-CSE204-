Making love with you was just so easy, baby
Like counting from one to three
Choosing you to be with was so pleasing, sugar
Eternally, yeah

Giving up my body was a rustling, darling
The night I remember well
How I watched you tremble and your body quiver
Girl, now don't you tell

Just you wait and see what I have in store
(Just you wait and see, baby)
Talking sexually, I will give you more
(Talking sexually, darling)
Feel the nature rising this heart of mine
(Feel the nature rising)
I will do it better to you, girl next time

I wanna do it till I get it right
I wanna make love to you day and night
Oooh yeah yeah, baby
I wanna do it till I get it right
I wanna make love to you day and night
Yeah, yeah

Day and night
With you baby, you baby, you baby, you baby

I wanna give you something to remember, baby (remember, baby)
You know I really can (you know I really can)
Satisfy the need that you've been missing, honey (missing, honey)
Do you understand (do you understand)

Move a little closer, let's get deeper baby (deeper baby)
Into this love affair (into this love affair)
I wanna taste the passions of a million kisses (million kisses)
Everywhere!

And just you wait and see what I have in store
(Just you wait and see, baby)
Talking sexually, I will give you more
(Talking sexually, darling)
Feel the nature rising this heart of mine
(Feel my nature rising)
I will do it better to you, girl next time

I wanna do it till I get it right
I wanna make love to you day and night
Oooh
I wanna do it till I get it right
I wanna make love to you day and night

I wanna do it till I get it right
I wanna make love to you day and night
(I wanna make love to you day and night, baby)
I wanna do it till I get it right (baby)
I wanna make love to you day and night
(I wanna make it, make it, make it, make it, make it baby)

I wanna do it till I get it right
I wanna make love to you day and night
(I wanna make it, make it, make it, make it, make it baby)
I wanna do it till I get it right (baby)
I wanna make love to you day and night
Oooh yeah, baby

Day and night
Day and night
No, nobody have to show me how to do it, baby
Day and night
I'm a sucker for a pretty face, and girl you know that
Day and night
Girl you dropped a bomb on me, and baby it exploded
Day and night
(Baby, baby, baby)

Day and night
Girl I'll love you for yourself, without a rhyme or reason
Day and night
I will love-a quench you girl, at any time and season
Day and night
Come girl and let me be the one to jump and pump, yes darling
Day and night
