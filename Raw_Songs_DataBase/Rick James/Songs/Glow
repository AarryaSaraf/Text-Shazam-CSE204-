You look so good
You look so beautiful
Don't you feel nice
Sweet and sexy one
Your skin is soft
And your eyes are clear
Please tell me how
You like that my dear

You beautiful thing
You beautiful thing
You glow, glow
Let your feelings show
Don't you know that if
You glow, glow
Keep smiling
You beautiful thing
You beautiful thing
You glow, glow
Don't you know you are beautiful
You'll feel much better
Just open up your heart and glow
Oh baby

Well you're so sweet
Your vibration's right
If you'll agree
We'll make love tonight
You're such a jewel
You're a precious gem
Open your heart girl
Let me come on in

You beautiful thing
You beautiful thing
You glow, glow
Don't you know you are beautiful
Smile and glow, glow
Oh baby
You beautiful thing
You beautiful thing
You glow, glow
Don't you know you are beautiful
You'll feel much better
Just open up your heart and glow
Oh baby
