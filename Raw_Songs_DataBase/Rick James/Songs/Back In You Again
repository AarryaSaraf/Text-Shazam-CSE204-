Glad to say that I really missed your sexy way
Here I am girl, back in you again
Since I've been gone, I thought about you everyday
Here I am, back in you again




Back in you again
I'm back in you, baby...
Girl you never know how much I miss you, baby
...

Girl you don't know the trouble that I'm in
The stories long, so let me see where I'll begin
So baby please listen as I run this down
My life is on shaky ground, yeah
Something very funky happened just the other day
Busted by the man for just getting it my way
Girl don't you see, it's as strange as it can be
Now everybody's out to get me
I'm glad to say

Glad to say that I really missed your sexy way
Here I am girl, back in you again
Since I've been gone, I thought about you everyday
Here I am, back in you again

One minute I'm in jail, the next I'm on the run
Bullets are chasing me from gangstas and police guns
But all I do is think of you and our new child-to-be
And suddenly I'm free yeah
Funky situation but you must believe
I'm still the man that loves you, yeah
Girl you know me and you know I wouldn't hurt no one
So now you see I'm on the run, yeah
I'm glad to say...

Glad to say that I really missed your sexy way
Here I am girl, back in you again
Since I've been gone, I thought about you everyday
Here I am, back in you again

Back in you again
I'm back in you, baby
...
Girl it feels so good
To be back in you again
...
