Girl, when all the stars are upon us
And you and I are alone together watching the universe
I then become aware
That you are as much a part of me as the stars in the galaxy
Tell me what you want
And I am as much a part of you as the heavens in our view
You are my love, you are my soul
Tell me what you want
And there is nothing in this whole wide world I wouldn't do for you
So tell me, tell me, what will me to do for you
Tell me what you want me to do for you

Girl, you're mine
It's you that I choose, and you know that's how it must be
(That's how it must be)
To give you love, that's all that I'm here for

I give you what you want
(I'll give you what you want when you want)
Anytime you ask me
(Anytime you ask me, call my name)
I'll give you what you need when you need it
(I'll give you what you need when you need)
All you do is ask me, woman, ask me
(Anytime you ask me, anytime you ask me)
Just ask me

Tell me what you want me to do for you
(Please tell me, what would you like me to do for you?)
Tell me what you want me to do for you
(Woman, I would live for you, I'll die for you)

You belong to only me
Girl, you know that's how it must be
(That's how it must be)
To give you love, that's all that I'm here for

I'll give you what you want
(I'll give you what you want when you want)
Anytime you ask me
(Anytime you ask me, call my name)
I'll give you what you need when you need it
(I'll give you what you need when you need)
All you do is ask me, woman, ask me
(Anytime you ask me, anytime you ask me)
Just ask me

Tell me what you want me, woman, to do for you
(Just tell me)
Tell me what you want me, woman, to do for you
(I will do for you)
Tell me what you want me, woman, to do for you
(I find you in my mind, and I find you in my spirit, yeah yeah yeah)
Tell me what you want me to do for you
(Get down on my knees for you)
Tell me what you want me to do for you
(Anything that you want me to, woman)
Tell me what you want me to do for you
Tell me what you want me to do for you
