Woke up this morning, the sign of loneliness had left my face
In its place, peaceful contentment
Seemed to caress me, as I watched you sleep
So beautiful you made me weep
Just yesterday we were strangers babe
Meeting each other in nighttime charades
You with a glance, I with romance
And together, we took a chance baby, yeah
We made love in the night
We made love in the night
Love in the night
If you want me say yeah, yeah
If you want me say yeah, yeah
Anger and madness, that's how I felt before I met you, dear
In my heart there was fear, oh, don't get me wrong now

They're many, many girls I have let use my bed
Take my heart and my head

Oh what's the use girl you're fast asleep
You can't hear me or see me, so what does it mean?
Is there a trace of a tear on your face
Could it truly be
You've been listenin' to me, yeah, baby

Let's make love in the night
Love in the nighttime is the right time for you baby

Love in the night
If you want me say yeah yeah
If you want me say yeah yeah
yeah baby

Love in the night
Baby, baby let's make love in the night
If it's good to you mama keep on talkin', say
Love in the nighttime is the right time for makin'
Love in the night
Love in the night
Love in the night, if it's good to you baby

(Love), Hear me talkin' to you people
(Love), Makin' love is gonna be so fine
Sing
Everybody make love
Everybody every single body
Let's make love yeah, yeah
(Let's make love)

People sing it, yeah yeah
(Let's make love)
When it feels lonely baby
(Let's make love)
Makin' love is better than war
(Let's make love)
Let's make love

Make love
Then every single body in the whole wide world needs a little love

Good night people
