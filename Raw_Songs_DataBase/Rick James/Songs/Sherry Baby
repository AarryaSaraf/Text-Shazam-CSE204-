Sherry baby, I got lots of money
Sherry baby, you got lots of time
I'd take you to the land of milk and honey
But you never could make up your mind

Sherry baby
Sherry baby

Sherry baby, you're a disappointment
You're a woman with no point of view
Sherry, bless yourself with holy ointment
Cause the devil's chasing after you, yeah

He's after you, yeah he's after you
Sherry baby
Sherry baby

Oh, Sherry your girls best friend
Oh, is that the reason you won't let me in
Oh, Sherry you need a man
Oh, you're not doin' the best you can

Sherry baby, relax
Sherry baby

Sherry baby, you got lots of feelin'
Don't you think it's time for you to share
Sherry baby, on your knees start kneelin'
And you're bound to find the answer waiting there

The answer's there, yeah the answer's there
Sherry baby, relax, take your time
Sherry baby

Oh, Sherry your girls best friend
Oh, is that the reason you won't let me in
Oh, Sherry you need a man
Oh, you're not doin' the best you can

Relax, take your time, Sherry baby
Relax, take your time, Sherry baby
Relax, take your time, Sherry baby
Relax, take your time, Sherry baby
