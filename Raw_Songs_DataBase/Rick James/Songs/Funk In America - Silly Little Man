Four, three, two, one...

Today, We the People of the United States of America
Are engaged in the invisible Third World War
It's only invisible, because we don't see or really wanna hear what's going on
The fact of the matter is, there are over 10,000 armed and ready
Nuclear missiles in the United States alone
Not counting other sites spread strategically across the globe
Ant it only takes a few hundred to guarantee total destruction
Funk in America

Between MX's, ICBM's, MIRV's and SLBM's and other missiles, there'll be no day after
And "All My Children" will not be televised today
Why? Because silly little men with power have all gone M.A.D.
M.A.D. meaning Mutually Assured Destruction for all of this
Funk in America

There'll be no NFL, no CIA, no neckties, or apartheids
No rayguns, no machine guns, no Weinbergers, no hamburgers
No Rambos or Gorbachevs to cheer or fear in this
Funk in America

And this sporting event will not be televised
So there'll be no scores in this rivalry of Democracy and Freedom
Against Communism and Totalitarianism
This game will only last minutes, and the playing field - the globe
And in the end, there are no winners at all

Did you read the news, oh boy
They dropped a bomb on the city
Blew the smile right off the child
Ain't that a shame and a pity (yeah)
Did you read the magazines
The president's under pressure
Russia won't cooperate
It's time to take other measures
Ooh-wee baby, baby

Can you really understand (can you really understand)
Such a silly man
Playing with your lives like toys (playing with your lives like toys)
Silly little boys
Can you really understand (can you really understand)
Such a silly man
Playing with your lives like toys (playing with your lives like toys)
Silly little boys

"Today, a top Air Force official told Congress, that a controversial MX missile has proved to be more accurate than expected"
"The Soviet Union is describing the first US test-lauch of an MX missile from an underground site as another case of group madness"
"Today, Russia keeps urging White House to stop supplying medium-range missiles to break world peace"

Do you know the game, oh boy
Two countries fight for survival
Neither one will win or lose
So here's a toast to the rival
What will all our children say
If there's no next generation
There won't be a place to play
When they drop the bombs on our nation
Ooh-wee baby, baby

Can you really understand (can you really understand)
Such a silly man
Playing with your lives like toys (playing with your lives like toys)
Silly little boys
Do you really understand (do you really understand)
Silly little men
Playing with your lives like toys (playing with your lives like toys)
Silly little boys

In case of a nuclear explosion
Place your head between your legs
And kiss your ass goodbye

They'll drop the bomb on you...

They'll drop the bomb on you...


"President Reagan met face-to-face with Soviet leader Gorbachev in Geneva, both sides challenging each other to stop the arms race"
"The Soviet news agency TASS says, Russia will take counter-action, if the U.S. continues to build MX missiles"
"President Reagan is trying to persuade Congress, to allow the Defense Departament to spend 1.5 billion dollars to produce 21 MX missiles"
"In Moscow, Soviet leader Gorbachev has announced, that new plan for peace is disarmament"
"U.S. officials told Congressional leaders, that if the United States did not go forward with the MX, we'd look like a weak puppy with European allies"




London Bridge is falling down
Falling down, falling down
London Bridge is falling down
My fair lady...
