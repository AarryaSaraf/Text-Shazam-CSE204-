Got you
Music and melody
Going on in my head
Got me
Wantin' to dance
Even when I'm in bed

Music and melody
That's all I'm thinking of
Give me a melody
Even when I make love

I want a melody
It's gotta go on and on (On and on)
I want a melody
It's gotta go on and on (On and on)

Because it makes you dance
Makes you dance, makes you dance
Melody
Makes me dance
Makes me dance melody
Melody

Music and melody
You got to have in your life
Music is my mistress
Melody is my wife

Music and melody
That's all I'm thinking of
Give me a melody
Even when I make love

I want a melody
It's gotta go on and on
And it makes me dance
Makes me dance
Makes me dance
Makes me dance

Melody on and on
Melody on and on
Melody on and on

Got you
I want a melody
Gotta go on and on
Got you
I want a melody
Gotta go on and on
