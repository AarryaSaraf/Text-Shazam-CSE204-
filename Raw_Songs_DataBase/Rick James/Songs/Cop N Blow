(Do-do-do-do-do...)
Uh, say girl
You look fine, freaky thing, you
I've got some love rap to put on you

Love me tender, love me right
Treat me special, come here tonight
Give me pleasure, and I'll give you fun
I'm not that kind of guy who likes to hit-n-run

I bet no one has ever said such things to you
Well pay attention, cause I'm not through
I bet no one has shown you what true love could be
It's happened to you, since you met me

Oh, I've been hurt by love before
Girl I know in my heart

Aah... blow!
I don't ever wanna cop-n-blow
No no, no no, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Blow!
I don't wanna cop-n-blow
No no, I don't wanna cop-n-blow, baby

Instead...

(Do-do-do-do-do...)
Uh, say young girl
I know you're old enough to understand what I'm saying to you
Now get on this, baby

Come on sweet thing, girl don't be shy
I won't hurt you, or make you cry
That's not my way girl, that's not my style
You'll feel so good girl, I think I'll stay a while

I bet no one has ever said such things to you
Talkin' sweet talk, the way I do
I bet no one has shown you what true love could be
Just come on baby, and follow me

Oh, I've been hurt by love before
And I know in my heart

Aah... blow!
I never ever wanna cop-n-blow
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Blow! No, no
I never ever wanna cop-n-blow
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Blow! Oh, no
I never ever wanna cop-n-blow
Baby, baby
Blow! Oh, no
I never ever wanna cop-n-blow
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Baby baby, blow!
Blow
Blow
Blow
Blow

Blow
Cop-n-blow
Blow
Cop-n-blow
Blow
Cop-n-blow
Blow
Cop-n-blow
Blow
Cop-n-blow (baby, baby, baby, baby)
Blow
Cop-n-blow (baby, baby, baby, baby)
Blow...
