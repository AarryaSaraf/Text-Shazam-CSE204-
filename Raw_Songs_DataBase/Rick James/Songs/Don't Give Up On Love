When you turn your back on love
It's like turnin' off the light
You're in the dark and you're all alone
To deny yourself of feeling
It's like looking for a candle
In the dark of night when there's a storm
To enslave your inner feelings
Of your heart and soul and mind
Will cause you just pain
In a matter of time
And to lock in all emotion
'Cause your heart has just been broken
And expect your love to come
Then you're wasting your time
Give your love
Give me more than just a minute
Put your heart and body in it
And give me all your love
Give your love
Make it last forever
Tell me that you'll never leave me in a day
Don't give up on love
'Cause if you do, if you do,
Love might just give up on you and you'll find
That your life will be lonely, lonely
When you tell me love's a game
And you only play to win
And expect my heart to gamble
Then you're wrong again
When you love just to possess
Losing touch on tenderness
Then you call yourself a friend,
Then you just pretend
When you're makin' love to me at night
And something there just isn't right
When the lovemakin' is through,
I wanna talk to you
When we talk of love as the bottom line
Between two sheets when the love is fine
Then when out of bed
Can't relate from the head
Give your love
Give me more than just a minute
Put your heart and body in it
And give me all your love
Give your love
Make it last forever
Tell me that you'll never leave me in a day
Don't give up on love, no, no
If you do, if you do,
Love just might give up on you
Don't give up on love
