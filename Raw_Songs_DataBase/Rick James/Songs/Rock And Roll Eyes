Can you remember long ago
You were my first real love
Elvis was on the rise
Singing for both of us

Can you remember yesterday
It breaks my heart, when I
Think of how our love went astray
Hurts me like when Hendrix died

Gave me a reason for living
Gave me a reason to try
Gave me a love I could see through, yeah
Looking in your rock and roll eyes

All these memories (all those memories)
They are fading (fading, fading, fading)
And they just keep on fading fast
If you come back, oh, I'll be waiting (waiting, waiting)
Ooh yeah, yeah

I want to look in your rock and roll eyes again
I want to look in your rock and roll eyes again
Yeah, yeah, yeah

If we only knew love hurts so much,
Would we play that song again?
Could we make the same mistakes?
Would Jimmy Dean ride again?

Give me a reason for living
Give me a reason to try
Give me a love I could see through, yeah
Looking in your rock and roll eyes

All these memories (all those memories)
They are fading (fading, fading, fading)
And they just keep on fading fast
If you come back, I'll be waiting (waiting, waiting)
Ooh yeah, yeah

I want to look in your rock and roll eyes again
I want to look in your rock and roll eyes again
Yeah, yeah, yeeeah...

I want to look in your rock and roll eyes again...
