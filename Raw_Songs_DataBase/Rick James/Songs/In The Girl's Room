- Girl am I tired. That gym class is really trying to kill me
- I know how you feel, my back's aching
- U want me to rub it for you?
- Would you?
- How's that?
- Mhm, that feels good...

I testify he was just a bit high
When he peeped in the hole in the doorway
He was amused, and the girls felt abused
What he saw would make you shake, shake

I wanna say it was his lucky day
All those girls in his eyes, just a-playin'
So why the trip, has the schoolmaster flipped
To expel him that's all I'm sayin'

Na na na na na naughty boy
Breakin' the rules in the girls' school
Na na na na na naughty boy
Playing around as he watched
The girls go down

In the girls' room
In the girls' room

I wanna know why does he have to go
Wouldn't you do the same in a minute
Can't I request, you put me to the test
All that he didn't do, was just get in it

Boys will be boys, no need to get annoyed
He was just having fun and got busted
Peeping in holes you will never control
There are some Peeping Toms that can't be trusted

Na na na na na naughty boy
Breakin' the rules in the girls' school
Na na na na na naughty boy
Playing around as he watched
The girls go down

In the girls' room
In the girls' room

He said she said someone heard a voice
Somebody is watching you
He looked into a hole
That's when he lost control, yeah
Somebody is watching you

He said she said someone saw his face
Somebody was watching you
In front of his two eyes
He got a freaky surprise, yeah

Ooh yeah
In the girls' room
In the girls' room
Hit me
