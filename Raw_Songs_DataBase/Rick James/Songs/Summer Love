Winter's gone
And like the seasons
I'm changing for reasons
I can feel your summer love comin' on
So warm and hot girl
I beg you don't stop
Could this be love that I'm going through
I can feel it
I can feel it
Could this be love
Summer love and you
Sitting in the park
Playing you love songs on my guitar
While the sun shines on your face like an angel
And with your eyes touching mine say it's time
This must be love that I'm goin' through
I can feel it, I can feel it
This must be love
Summer love and you
Could this be love I'm goin' through
Warm as the sun soft as the mornin' dew
