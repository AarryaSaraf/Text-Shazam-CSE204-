Love me tender baby
I don't like no pain (I don't like no pain)
Make me surrender sugar
When you call my name (my name is Rick)
Rock me roll me
Baby don't you stop (Don't you ever stop)
Wake me shake me
When your love gets hot
I can feel your body burning to my flesh
Like fire, hot fire
Baby you can call me up (You know my number)
Hey baby you can call me up
Call me up
Touch me places baby
I've never been touched before (You can do it baby)
Kiss me in spaces make me holler out for more
Give more & more
Give me pleasure baby
Give me every bit you got (Give it to me baby)
Make me feel better by telling me
You'll never stop (Say you'll never stop)
I can feel your body burnin' to my flesh
Like fire hot fire

Baby when you want a hand to hold
When you don't want to be alone just gotta call me up
Baby when you do it all night
When you want to get it right
Just gotta call me up
Baby when you want my lovin' around
And when you want to get on down
Just gotta call me up
Baby when you want to do it all night
When you want to get it right
Just gotta call me up
