// Can't Stop //

Can't stop, can't stop, can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop, can't stop, can't stop, can't stop

There's something in the air
It's telling me I should beware
Can't stop, can't stop, can't stop, can't stop
These multi city streets
Make it so that you can't miss a beat
Can't stop, can't stop, can't stop, can't stop
I've got to keep my two eyes open today
Look out for someone that might have the urge to play
Maybe go to California with a suitcase in my hand
Get me a suite in Beverly Hills and have
The best of life and thrills

I can't stop
No I just can't stop it now
I can't stop
Got to keep on rocking and living it up
Ain't never gonna give up
I can't stop
No I just can't stop it now
I can't stop
Got to keep on rocking and living it up
Ain't never gonna give up

I can't stop babe

There's something in the air
It's telling me I should beware
Can't stop, can't stop, can't stop, can't stop
These multi city streets
Make it so that you can't miss a beat
Can't stop, can't stop, can't stop, can't stop
I've got to keep my two eyes open today
Look out for someone that might have the urge to play
Maybe go to California with a suitcase in my hand
Get me a suite in Beverly Hills and have
The best of life and thrills

I can't stop
No I just can't stop it now
I can't stop
Got to keep on rocking and living it up
Ain't never gonna give up
I can't stop
No I just can't stop it now
I can't stop
Got to keep on rocking and living it up
Ain't never gonna give up

I can't stop, I can't stop

// Spend The Night With Me //

She knew me
Such a long time ago
The only thing changed on me
Was my smile

She said
"How long before your show
And can I sit and talk to you for awhile?"
Oh yeah

She has fire in her eyes
She had moonlight lips and
Something strange and tantalizing

Told me
I could not resist her charms
Being locked up in her arms
Baby spend the night with me

Oh baby
Spend the night with me
Oh baby

She said
She came so far to see
If everything she heard
About me was true
Oh yeah

I said "A friend you'll always be"
Then she said
"I need something from you"
Oh baby

She had fire in here eyes
She had moonlight lips and
Something strange and tantalizing

Told me
I could not resist her charms
I'd be wrapped up in her arms
Baby spend the night with me

Tonight
It will be another night for love

Baby, tonight
It's alright
Let us share another night for love

Baby, tonight
It's so tight
It must be another night for love

Baby, tonight
It's so tight
Let us share another night of love
Baby spend the night with me

Oh baby, oh baby
Baby spend the night with me
Oh baby

Spend the night with me, baby
We'll make love for a million years

Spend the night with me, baby
You'll never cry another tear
For years and years and years
And years

Spend the night
Spend the night with me, baby
Spend the night
Spend the night with me, baby

// Melody Make Me Dance //

Going on in my head

Give me a melody

Music is my mistress
Melody is my wife

Music and melody

And it makes me dance
Makes me dance

Melody on and on
Melody on and on

Got you

Gotta go on and on
Got you

Gotta go on and on

// Somebody (The Girl's Got) //

The girl's really fine
And she likes me good and plenty
She gives me love
Behind my four walls
At night

She's really hot
She understands my problems
She never stops
Giving me her all and all
Oh yeah

She's really hot
She's got somebody
Oh yeah
Girl's got alot
Mind, body and all
Hear me talkin' to ya baby?

Girl's really hot
She's got somebody
Oh yeah
She's got alot
Mind, body and all

She was in love
And she was deserted
He was the fool
Leaving her all alone
Oh yeah

I came along
All her pain that hurted
I kissed away
And made
Her weak heart strong
Oh yeah

She's a mystery to me
And the man who set her free
Was a fool

But that's the way
The story goes
When you love
Nobody follows any rules
Yeah

She's as sweet as cherry pie
She's the apple of my eye
She's my lover

She's got somebody
Oh baby
Girl's got somebody
She's got somebody
Oh baby
Girl's got somebody
She's got somebody
Oh baby
Girl's got somebody

She's really hot
She's got somebody
Oh yeah
Girl's got alot
Mind, body and all
She's really hot
She's got somebody
Oh yeah
Girl's got alot
Mind, body and all
Somebody
Somebody

// Moonchild //

So soft and gentle with her hazel eyes
So sentimental and she shows no despise
When I'm down and I'm troubled
She is always there in my times of despair
She's an angel in my life
And through all of these years
She'd never waste a tear
Wanna make the whole world pay attention
There is someone special in my life
Give the girl an honorable mention
When you talk of all the angels in the sky!
Heaven must have sent her, Hallelujah!
To be there even in my times of strife
She's really someone special in my life
She's my moon child!

Moon child [3x]
She's my moon child!
Moon child [3x]

Hey, Cancer lady, don't you know I understand?
There's no need to be lonely
I will always be your man
You cook and you labor with desires of your own
Just please remember
In my heart, in my life, you'll always have a home
Wanna make the whole world pay attention
Someone's very special in my life
Give this girl an honorable mention
When you talk of all the angels in the sky!
Heaven must have sent her, Hallelujah!
To be there even in my times of strife
She's really someone special in my life
She's my moon child!

Moon child [3x]
She's my moon child!
Moon child [3x]
Fancy dancer
Witty Cancer
Lovely lady
Never shady
She's mine!

// Sha La La La La (Come Back Home) //

Each man who sees you
Wants to share your love
I guess you're just
A fantasy of mine

And everytime I think
Of you and I
I feel a rush
All lover my body

I'm not the kind of man
Who acts so shy
When I want someone
My heart won't deny

It's more than you I want, girl
Don't you see?
More than your love, girl
More than your body

Sha la la la la
Baby, please come back home
Sha la la la la
'Cause I love you so
I love you so

Sha la la la la
Baby, please come back home
Sha la la la la
I love you so
Sha la la la la
Baby, please come back home
Sha la la la la
I love you so
Sha la la la la
Baby, please come back home
Sha la la la la
I love you so
Don't you know that?

Just yesterday i woke
And found you gone
Left with a memory
That's so divine

As if we didn't make love
All night long
So saying goodbye
Girl, only made me cry

I'm not the kind of man
Who wants to be alone
My heart was yours, girl
Yes , it was your home

And as I lay here, girl
I think of you
Hoping so you'll call
Give me your all and all
This time

Sha la la la la
Baby, please come back home
Sha la la la la
I love you so
I love you so
I love you so

Don't you know that?
Don't you know that?
You should know that

Sha la la la (Baby, please come home)
Sha la la la la la la la (Baby, please come home)

Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la

// Rock And Roll Control //

Come here, baby
I'm feelin' so good
I want to
Tell the world about it
I got to let you know

I'm feelin' so tough
Want to scream
And want to shout it
And let my feelings show

I'm feelin' so strong
Couldn't stay away
Too long
I just went out for a while

But now I'm back y'all
Did you think
That I would fall
And not get up in style?

I feel a fire in my feet
Feel my shoes about to heat
I got no (Rock and roll control)

I feel my body burnin' hot
I don't even want to stop (Rock and roll control)

Come here, baby
(Rock and roll control)
(Rock and roll control)

I was so shy
All I did was get high
And live my life in a dream

I was snowblind
That my two eyes couldn't find
A true reality

I was so low
That the only place I'd go
Was deep inside my mind

That's when I found out
What my heart was all about
And now I'm feelin' fine

I feel a fire in my feet
Feel my shoes about to heat
Got no (Rock and roll control)

There's a burnin' in my shoes
Wanna scream
And shout the news (Rock and roll control)

Feel the fire in my shoes
Want to scream
And shout the news (Rock and roll control)

Come here, baby
Feel a fire in my feet
Feel my shoes about to heat (Rock and roll control)

Gimme the rock
Gimme the roll
Wanna scream
Wanna loose control
(Rock and roll control)

Once upon a time
A friend of mine
In New York City said
"What's the matter with you, boy
And what's wrong with your head?"

(Ain't got no)
(Rock and roll control)

Feel the fire in my feet
Feel my shoes about to heat (Rock and roll control)

Gimme the rock
Gimme the roll
Wanna thrill and fill my soul
(Rock and roll control)

Wanna scream
And wanna shout
Wanna tell the world about
(Rock and roll control)
(Rock and roll control)

// Glow (Reprise) //

Let love forever flow
From your heart
Leave your heart open
To each and everyone
Your love's like a rainbow
Shining
So let your love shine
Shine
You'll find
All your dreams
Will come true if only
You just
Let somebody know
Open your heart
You will glow
You will glow
You will glow
