// Only One //

Pain, made to order
Pain, made to order
Pain, made to order
Pain

I'm not the second coming, I'm the first wave
Better get an army 'cause the fire left me unscathed
You bet your bottom dollar I'm the top of the shit pile
So stick around 'cause I'll get to you in just a few
Step off the Achtung, get back or get stung
Idiotic sense of yourself, are you that dumb?
Entire legion of me, totalitarian
The one and only motherfucker, top of the world, man
'Cause I can't stand it, planned it, gonna crash, land it
In other words, consider me branded
Another version of me, another version of you
Both barrels, what you gonna do?

All I hear is human noise
You made your own fucking choice
I belong to only me
Silence for my revelry

I can only die over time
Filthy hands, stay away from mine
Every reason is a right to hate
Painful clutch, death is fine, give me mine

Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away

Somebody explain this
You don't care 'cause you don't exist
What the fuck is this another joke?
Reckoning

Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away
Only one of us walks away

Pain!

Here comes the pain

Enemy
Show me what you wanna be
I can handle anything
Even if I can't handle you

Readily
Either way it better be
Don't you fuckin' pity me
Get up, get off...

What the hell am I sayin'?
I don't know about malevolent
Sure as hell decadent
I want somebody to step up, step off

Walls!
Let me fall! Fuck you all!
Get a grip, don't let me slip
'Til I drop the ball

Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it
You're goin' down, this is a war!

Fuck it!

Who the fuck am I to criticize your twisted state of mind?
You're leavin' me suspect, I'm leavin' you grotesque
Feels like a burn from which you never learn
Cause and effect, you jealous ass
Press your face against the glass - suffer

Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it
You're goin' down, this is a war!

Go!

I've just begun
It's about that time
Gotta get mine
I've just begun
It's about that time
Gotta get mine
I've just begun
It's about that time
Gotta get mine
I've just begun
It's about that time
Gotta get mine

You can't kill me
'Cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me
'Cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me
'Cause I'm already inside you
You can't kill me
'Cause I'm already inside you

Sick

// Eyeless //

Insane - Am I the only motherfucker with a brain?
I'm hearing voices but all they do is complain
How many times have you wanted to kill
Everything and everyone - Say you'll do it but never will

You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
Can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes

I am my father's son
'Cause he's a phantom, a mystery and that leaves me nothing!
How many times have you wanted to die?
It's too late for me. All you have to do is get rid of me!

You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
Can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes

It's all in your head
It's all in my head
It's all in your head

I tried - You lied to me for so long
Everywhere I go, there's a sense of it
Freak on my antics and give me a choice
Doesn't matter if I give a shit
It's shit that you gave me

You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
Can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes

It's all in your head
It's all in my head
It's all in your head

Do you wanna feel pain?
Takin' my name in vain
Caring never felt so lame inside
Anybody else got pride?
Do you wanna take my life?
Maybe I'll reverse my ride
Who the fuck are you?
Fuck you!
Better suck it up 'cause you bled through
Better get away from me
Stay the fuck away from me!

I feel safe
Seems you're saved
I feel safe
Seems you're saved

Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye

Motherfucker!

Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye

Look me in my brand new

// Wait And Bleed //

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

Goodbye!

I wipe it off on a tile
The light is brighter this time
Everything is 3D blasphemy
My eyes are red and gold
The hair is standing straight up
This is not the way I pictured me
I can't control my shakes
How the hell did I get here?
Something about this, so very wrong
I have to laugh out loud
I wish I didn't like this
Is it a dream or a memory?

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

Get outta my head 'cause I don't need this
Why didn't I see this?
Well, I'm a victim - Manchurian candidate
I have sinned by just making my mind up
And taking your breath away

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

Goodbye!

You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
My flesh was in my bones
The pain was always free

You haven't learned a thing
I haven't changed a thing
My flesh was in my bones
The pain was always free

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

I've felt the hate rise up in me
Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
I wander out where you can't see
Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

And it waits for you!

// Surfacing //

Fuck you all! (All)

Running out of ways to run
I can't see, I can't be
Over and over and under my skin
All this attention is doing me in!

Fuck it all! Fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong! Don't exist!
Don't give a shit!
Don't ever judge me!

Picking through the parts exposed
Taking shape, taking shag
Over and over and under my skin
All this momentum is doing me in!

Fuck it all! Fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong! Don't exist!
Don't give a shit!
Don't ever judge me!

And don't you fucking judge me

Burn!

You got all my love, livin' in your own hate
Drippin' hole man, hard step, no fate
Show you nothing, but I ain't holdin' back
Every damn word I say is a sneak attack
When I get my hands on you
Ain't a fucking thing you can do
Get this 'cause you're never gonna get me
I am the very disease you pretend to be

I am the push that makes you move
I am the push that makes you move
I am the push that makes you move
I am the push that makes you move

Fuck it all! Fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong! Don't exist!
Don't give a shit!
Don't ever judge me!
Fuck it all! Fuck this world!
Fuck everything that you stand for!
Don't belong! Don't exist!
Don't give a shit!
Don't ever judge me!

Burn!

// Spit It Out //

Did you never give a damn in the first place?
Maybe it's time you had the tables turned
'Cause in the interest of all involved I got the problem solved
And the verdict is guilty...

...Man nearly killed me
Steppin' where you fear to tread
Stop, drop and roll - you were dead from the git-go!
Big mouth fucker, stupid cocksucker!
Are you scared of me now? Then you're dumber than I thought
Always is and never was
Foundation made of piss and vinegar
Step to me, I'll smear you - think I fear you? Bullshit!
Just another dumb punk chompin' at this tit
Is there any way to break through the noise?
Was it something that I said that got you bent?
Gotta be that way if you want it
Sanity, literal profanity hit me!

Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out

Maybe it's the way you gotta spread a lot of rumour fodder
Keepin' all your little spies and leavin' when you realize
Step up, fairy
I guess it's time to bury your ass with the chrome
Straight to the dome
You heard me right, bitch, I didn't stutter
and if you know what's good - just shut up and beg, brother
Back stab - don't you know who you're dissin'?
Side swipe - we know the ass that you're kissin'!
Biggidy - biggidy bitch boy, halfway houser
I don't hear shit 'cause it keeps gettin' louder
Come up and you get a face full o' tactic
Lippin' off hard, goin' home in a basket
You got no pull, no power, no nothin'
Now you start shit? Well, ain't that somethin'?
Payoffs don't protect, and you can hide if you want
But I'll find you - comin' up behind you!

Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out

'Bout time I set this record straight
All the needle-nose punchin' is makin' me irate
Sick o' my bitchin' fallin' on deaf ears
Where you gonna be in the next five years?
The crew and all the fools, and all the politics
Get your lips ready, gonna gag, gonna make you sick
You got dick when they passed out the good stuff
Bam
Are you sick of me? Good enough - had enough

Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!

Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!

Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out
Spit it out
All you wanna do is drag me down
All I wanna do is stamp you out

// Frail Limb Nursery //

Go on, what about the boy?
She lay as though she were in a trance
With her long eyelashes fluttering like she was dreaming
She said to him "I lie beyond the sea"
And then all of a sudden her head dipped back, and she vanished
Gone, gone without a trace
She's never coming back
Do you know what it's like to live with that?
No one knows what it's like
The only one who knew me, gone
I know what you want, and I can give it to you
I am hungry and tired
Have you ever seen God?

// Purity //

Maze
Psychopathic daze
I create this waste
Back away from tangents on the verge of drastic ways
Can't escape this place
I deny your face
Sweat gets in my eyes, I think I'm slowly dying

Put me in a homemade cellar
Put me in a hole for shelter
Someone hear me please
All I see is hate
I can hardly breathe
And I can hardly take it

Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't get out!
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't

Lost
Ran at my own cost
Hearing laughter, scoffed
Learning from the rush
Detached from such and such
Bleak
All around me, weak
Listening, incomplete
I am not a dog, but I'm the one you're dogging

I am in a buried kennel
I have never felt so final
Someone find me please, losing all reserve
I am fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying

Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't get out!
Hands on my face, overbearing, I can't

You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something in you I despise

Cut me
Show me
Enter
I am willing and able
And never any danger to myself
Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain
Or was my tolerance a phase?
Empathy, out of my way

I can't die
I can't die
I can't die
I can't die!

You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something in you I despise

Liberate my madness
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate my madness
I just want to
Liberate my madness
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate my madness

Section off myself
Put a wall up
What the hell have I done
Keep the dog at bay
Survive by saving me!
Values and the game
Not a fuck-up
Not a part of your lie
I am one, I am all, I'm above and beyond!

Stand off of the shit
Back off or I'll spit
So soft, you forget
Your garbage in is garbage out
You don't give a shit
I won't play the fit
Get off, get on this
Your garbage in is garbage out

I am not ashamed
What is vital isn't always humane
You can break in vain
But you can't break away
Even in my face
Lot of bullshit, not a lotta the truth
I can't see from here
But I can smell your fear

Back off of the shit
Stand off or I'll spit
So soft, you forget
Your garbage in is garbage out
You don't give a shit
I won't play the fit
Get off, get on this
Your garbage in is garbage out

Saved
You're such a slave
I don't expect a name
You don't care
I wasn't a witness
I can't be a part of a system such as this

Hard eyes
Glow right
In my darkness again
With the sickness, renegade sisters, blisters
Salivate, litigate, liberate, madness, sadness
Fuck this
How long have I had this?
I don't need this
Outta my business
Insert, engage, betrayed, my God
Fraud

Liberate my madness
(One of me, all of you)
Liberate my madness
I just want to
Liberate my madness
(One of me, all of you)

Even if you run, I will find you
I decided I want you, now I know I need
If you can't be bought, tougher than I thought
Keep in mind, I'm with you
Never left out fate, can't concentrate
Even if you run

You will be mine!
A fucking you will be mine!
A fucking you will be mine!
A fucking you will be mine!

I found you
Leanin' out of an open window
You laughed, your fingers clenched
Too perfect, far too careless
I couldn't help myself, I just took you

Damn it, man, I knew it was a mistake

Better make yourself at home, you're here to stay
You won't bother me if you let me bother you
All the doors are locked, all the windows shut

Never leave my side, never leave me, fucker

// No Life //

My freedom is best
Whole country's on house arrest
And everyone's a suspect
You can't feel the flow because you died
Face down on a "suicide"
The motherfucker's on self-destruct
Nobody guardin' your back, it's all a front
Save this! My rage is bliss!
I'm takin' names and gettin' pissed!

Where's Chuck D when ya need him?
You ain't shit, just a puddle on the bed spread
The maniac psycho
Cool J screamed the shit but I still can't believe it
Man, it's funny that you scare me so
Just enough to fuck me up again and again
Hard life is hard as hell
Better back the fuck on up
'Cause this is...

No kind of life! This is no kind of life!
(I've got to get out)
It's no kind of life! This is no kind of life!
(You can't blame me)

Can't be real no more, your mask is skin and bone
Savor every flavor you got 'cause it's not your own
Bad-ass at bat, man
Forget about the battle, it's the war we gotta win
Breathe, amer-cult, breathe! One more seethe!
Freak like you gotta pair, won't be my fault
When you're painted in the corner of a no-good life
This is...

No kind of life! This is no kind of life!
(I've got to get out)
It's no kind of life! This is no kind of life!
(You can't blame me)

I can't remember, I don't understand
Is it malice that makes you this way?
Carry it with you 'til someone forgives you
I laugh 'cause there's nothing to say
You can't begin to consider the palpable hate
In the air when you're here
None of us wonder what weather you're under
You're making it perfectly clear

Lights ain't on, shit ain't right
Never had peace but I gotta fight
Can you look in my eyes when my back's against the wall?
Slash at my eyes, surprise, you'll never get me
You're all reality and sound bites
And the freedom is never in plain sight
The feelings, the question
The price is too human for fucking sake
This is...

No kind of life! This is no kind of life!
(I've got to get out)
It's no kind of life! This is no kind of life!
(You can't blame me)

I can't be!
I can't be!
I can't be blamed!

// Diluted //

I'm cold, I'm ugly
I'm always confused by everything
I can stare into a thousand eyes
But every smile hides a bold-faced lie

It itches, it seethes, it festers and breathes
My heroes are dead, they died in my head
Thin out the herd, squeeze out the pain
Something inside me has opened up again
Thoughts of me exemplified, all the little flaws I have denied
Forget today, forget whatever happened
Every day I see a little more of overall deficiencies
I'm nothing short of being one complete catastrophe

What the hell (The hell)
Did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell (The hell)
Did I do to deserve all of this?

I save all the bullets from ignorant minds
Your insults get stuck in my teeth as they grind
Way past good taste, on our way to bad omens
I decrease, while my symptoms increase
God, what the fuck is wrong? You act like you knew it all along
Your timing sucks, your silence is a blessing
All I ever wanted out of you was something you could never be
Now take a real good look at what you've fucking done to me

What the hell (The hell)
Did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell (The hell)
Did I do to deserve all of this?

"I haven't got time for the living."
"I haven't got time for the living."

Give me any reason why I'd need you, boy
Give me any reason why I'd need you
Give me any reason why I'd need you, boy
Give me any reason not to fuck you up
Give me any reason why I'd need you, bitch
Give me any reason why I'd need you
Give me any reason why I'd need you, bitch
Give me any reason not to fuck you up
I see you in me
I see you in me
I see you in me
I see you in me
I see you in me
I see you in me
I see you in me
I see you in me

I keep my scars from prying eyes, incapable of ever knowing why
Somebody breathe, I've got to have an answer
Why am I so fascinated by bigger pictures, better things?
But I don't care what you think, you'll never understand me

What the hell (The hell)
Did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell (The hell)
Did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell (The hell)
Did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell (The hell)
Did I do to deserve all of this?

// Scissors //

I play doctor for five minutes flat
Before I cut my heart open and let the air out
Three bugs, a pound of dust, some wind spilled before me
In the strangest manner that had broke away my tear spout

As I lie there with my tongue spread wide open
A black widow had offered me a sweetheart tube
As I injected the candied heart that I selected
She said don't hesitate, just do what you have to do to me

It's hard to stay between the lines of skin
Just 'cause I have nerves, don't mean that I can feel
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway
Just let the blood run red 'cause I can't feel
It's hard to stay between the lines of skin
Just 'cause I have nerves, don't mean that I can feel
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway
Just let the blood run red 'cause I can't feel

Biding my time until the time is right

Scratching away the abscess
One more, two more
Everyone, once more

I want to see you splayed before me
You are the only one
That I would rather see before me
You want it, you need it

Don't lie; I die, you lie; I lie, oh, why?
I don't want you to pay anyone when I die

Severed me from all emotion
Life is just too fucking hard
Snap, your face was all it took
'Cause this need ain't doing me no good
Fall on my face, but can't you see?
This fucking life is killing me

Tearing me inside
Tearing me inside
Tearing me inside
Tearing me inside

Too far gone, I'm catatonic
Leaving you to criticize
Empty shell and running naked
All alone, lobotomized
Back and forth between my hang-ups
It isn't easy to be hated
Where do ya go? What do ya do?
Simpleton, impromptu
Crazy eight, I never cared
Not once, got to get away

Tearing me inside
Tearing me inside
Tearing me inside
Tearing me inside

I wasn't promised a thing
You keep mocking me
But you will never again
Before you know it, after you're gone

You're gone, you're gone
Somos feos y apestamos pero reinamos joto, motherfucker
You're gone, you're gone

I wasn't promised a thing
You keep mocking me
But you will never again
Before you know it, after you're gone

Gone, gone, gone
Pray

// Get This //

(Fuck!)
Give me a scream, Corey!
Yeah!

I don't like a fuckin' thing
Music sucks dick
Suck the snot end of the tip of my prick
You fucking cunts
Get off of my back
I don't wanna do a show with your shitty fuckin' band
You suck, they suck, guess what? Get fucked
I can't think of any other words to say but fuck
Don't drag our opinions, our opinions are great
It's new school face motherfuckers I hate

So, local bands (suck these nuts!)
U.S. bands (suck these nuts!)
Worldwide bands (suck these nuts!)
All you bands can suck these fuckin' nuts, go!

Don't berate me
'Cause you can't stop me
From breaking your face
It's you I'll erase
It's hate motherfucker!
Hate motherfucker!
Hate!

Local bands (suck these nuts!)
U.S. bands (suck these nuts!)
Worldwide bands (suck these nuts!)
All you bands can suck these fuckin' nuts, go!

Life's so shitty, but ain't it fucking great?
Life's so shitty, but ain't it fucking great?
Life's so shitty, but ain't it fucking great?
Life's so shitty, but ain't it fucking great?

Get this or die! Get this or die! Get this or die! Get this or die!

One, two, look out behind you
Bitch, gonna be on all you
Peace suffocates their freedom
This'll better me, a part of me
You were a par and a nag
Thinking that you lost, my friend
It doesn't matter what price, you win
Blood, sweat, and bastard-size
Stare into the killer in your eyes!

Besiege me! I kiss your cancer
Deceiving, this doesn't matter
Becoming degraded dated
Behind me, one more I swear I'm gonna

Fuck you!

Many have come and gone
Still left out of the guttural swansong
Takin' nothin' but the best in the area
Get me grief, but fucker I'll stare you down
Two, three you're out of there
Maybe it's me, but I'm frantic in a panic
Ain't never had a problem since you stopped coming here
Big man walkin' but bitch, I'm still talkin'
Can't you see it's gotta be this way?

Give me any reason why I'd need you, (boy)
Give me any reason why I'd need you, (boy)
Give me any reason why I'd need you, (boy)
Give me any reason not to fuck you up

Ain't gonna leave and you know I'm never gone fade
Here it comes again - gotta burn again
Time now, throw down, don't dirty me
Right on your ugly ass face because
I ain't not the one who let you in
And I ain't not the one who set you off
But I know damn well when someone's pushin' my buttons
Lemme tell you somethin' - I'll push you back!
"As soon as that camera is off, he gonna fuck that little dog."

Give me any reason why I'd need you, (boy)
Give me any reason why I'd need you, (boy)
Give me any reason why I'd need you, (boy)
Give me any reason not to fuck you up
Give me any reason why I'd need you, (bitch)
Give me any reason why I'd need you, (bitch)
Give me any reason why I'd need you, (bitch)
Give me any reason not to fuck you up

You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on
You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on
You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on
You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on
You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on
You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on
You're made of flesh - now what I'm focused on
You're made of flesh

// Despise //

Despise!

Maze, psychopathic daze, I create this waste
Back away from tangents, on the verge of drastic ways
Can't escape this place, I deny my face
Sweat gets in my eyes, I shout at all I despise

(Ooh)
Hands on my face overbearing I can't get out
(Ooh)
Hands on my face overbearing I can't get out

Lost, run at my own cost, hearing laughter, scoffed
Searching from the rush, detached from such and such
Bleak, standing on my feet, listening, incomplete
I am not a dog, but I'm the one you dog

(Ooh)
Hands on my face overbearing I can't get out
(Ooh)
Hands on my face overbearing I can't get out

Never - ever - surrender - I won't allow it
Never - ever - surrender - I won't allow it
Never - ever - surrender - I won't allow it
Never - ever - surrender - despise
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
Despise!
Despise!
Despise!
Despise!

Cut me - show me - enter - I am willing and able and never any danger to myself
Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain
Or was my tolerance a phase?
Empathy, out of my way
I can't die
I can't die
I can't die
I can't die

Never - ever - surrender - I won't allow it
Never - ever - surrender - I won't allow it
Never - ever - surrender - I won't allow it
Never - ever - surrender - despise
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
My state of mind gets so one-sided
Despise!
Despise!
Despise!
Despise!
