Album: LordGivethLordTakethAway

// Lord Giveth, Lord Taketh Away //

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Uh, we book niggers for shows
Take all they money and jewelry for good-dicking these hoes
Buck-naked, leave 'em exposed, my bitches, I line 'em up
Sex texts, naked pics, have 'em thinking she down to fuck
That's my MO, at the M-O-T-E-L
With a hot plate of some hard bitch, I bet these sells
Quicker than Jordans on a Saturday, psycho like Donny Hathaway
God as my witness
Going for bitches like I'm a Latter Day
Saint, but I ain't, I'm one of Satan's descendents
Fathering nigger's flows, I should claim 'em like they dependents
Taxin' niggers on wax cause they get it
Rap is the act, trappin' and packing gats
Arrest court date, hard times, heart break
Grind 'til the last crumb, selling dubs soft shake
An open shop and a close mouth'll keep your mouth fed

[Hook x2: Freddie Gibbs]
Lord giveth, Lord taketh away
Make a dollar for tomorrow, we gon' take it today
I guess I'm in to take your shit, that's what it take to get paid
You a gangster, do your thing and take your shit to the grave, nigger

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Uh, we book niggers for clubs
They say they don't need security, claiming they really thugs
I'm legit, so I could give two shits if you really was
Put some plug with some fools that'll put your dick in the mud
Have a rapper do a walk through, let the nigger walk out
Pistols on the promoter, throw chippers so we gonna chalk out
Niggers take off that shiny shit
Man these niggas dry, cutting they dope with vitamins
Acetone, hard to leave that crack alone
Government got heroin narcotics strung out on this methodone
New dope, new wave, four P's, oxycotin, no beef
Can't break it down or shoot it, think you gotta snort these
Plenty niggas OD, not just on drugs
But I'm chasing money fuck it, so the fo' wait for fo G's
And it was some bullshit, but I had to get it in
Took it back from his ass and re-up and sell that shit again

// Rap Money //

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Take a dance with the devil if you will
Hit the booth to lay my vocals with a seven of some kill
Still addicted to the reefer, been a chiefer since a teen though
Started serving sacks of stress, weed through my screen door
Went to banging them boulders through my burglar bars
Knowing every fiend that I serve, I could get served with a charge
People set me up, tried to rob me in my cousin garage
Even your family will fuck you, fuck love, its just a facade
I need some rap money, pimping my pen, getting paid, bitch
Paper in my pocket before I jump on the stage, bitch
Let them labels know that a piece of change ain't gonna change him
Cuz' way before I gave you this Gary thing I was slanging, banging
Eastside niggas gotta eat
Got caught up on 65, it's been dry for about a week
Pray to the heavenly father, now I lay me down to sleep
I promise I'ma take my hands up out the streets if I could only get some rap money

[Hook: Freddie Gibbs]
Ya rather do this shit than that shit
Don't get it fucked up that's just some rap shit
Ya rather do this than that shit
Don't get it fucked up that's just some rap shit

[Verse 2: Daz Dillinger]
Started smoking Chronic out with Doctor Dre
Youngest out the group, wishing and hoping to get paid
Starving on two bags of weed with seven niggas
Created Doggystyle, the youngest up out to live the Dogg Pound
Still hungry, poured us some dog food, alleged
Don't try to tell me dreams don't come true
Formatted the plan, the motherfucking man
Rap money in my hand, mo' G's and mo' gram
Hooked up with Pac, all eyes on me
Just call me that nigga Daz or the D-A-Z
Twenty years later I'm here just like I never left
Rock the motherfucking stage, every night I collect
Worldwide respect, keep it independent
Distribute and press my own CDs, ya little nigga
Sixty days later this how a nigga spend it
Rap money, hundred thousand sold, nigga meal ticket
Love rap money

[Hook]

// Wild Style //

Is the return of the wild style, just [?]
Wild style, wild style
Is the return of the wild style, just [?]
Is the return

I'm on a spiritual high smoke that lyrical lie,
My cutties keep that vanilla shit in the sky
Even if it's laced, I roll piff to get by,
The burner in your face means you got some shit in your eye
I fire shots put your ass in a quiet box
And when the riot stops I'm the one firing cops
I smoke Phillies I can kill an entire box
I'm the Gorilla killer you on ya mozilla firefox
Try and bark, I'll put you down on dead dogs, cause I'm a shark
Really to you I'm Reinhart,
I run over ya head, leaving your face with tire marks, put a grenade in your mouth
And blow your life apart,
And any mission I embark has a violent start,
Bloody ending is so depending if the knife is sharp,
This is psycho talk my blades lipo-sharp, I'm down to fight a whole block, fuck the cops!

[Chorus:]
Is the return of the wild style, wild style
Just [?]
Wild style, wild style
Is the return of the wild style, just [?]
Is the return

All I do is write verses and wrap up rubberbands
Roll a'84 and roll up a Wood with my other hand
And I fuck with felons don't fuck with the F.E.D.s
They know I'm selling something ain't nobody selling cd's
Another trick up my sleeve, but another bitch that I'm sticking
I introduce to the sniffing and dickin' different positions
Got introduced to some friends and sit back as if I was flipping
She sniffing that shit in daily, your daughter need interventions!
That's some cold shit! Fred, you musta be smoking water when you wrote this
Nah I'm in Brooklyn, back from Gary fresh off a dope flip
Do the speed limit pay attention and never smoke shit
Call up Dominican H and told him I was posted!
Baby face gangsta stay with 3 bangers
Heat the microwave and cut up them cookies like Famous Amos
Shit get rectified by sticking this dope in a bitch's anus
Hit the visible, shoot that to my brother let's get this paper bitch!

[Chorus]

Flow superior to others often than I'm fell
Freddie and fred feel like I'm talking to myself
Far as rhymes I'm awesome
The metaphors I own want they own line in a auction
Caution niggas I'm often, no discussion, your moms will take care of the coughin, robatussin
Selectah know 'matics will wet ya I ain't really got beef I'm just kind of collector
Is the return of the wild style ice in the quarter rock back to the vials now
They one dimensional I got styles now, tomorrow's best lyrics is my freestyles now
I respect you when you when you spit shit, you far from nice you need jet blue to get there
I might style Slick Rick mixed with Rick Flair, pardon my terminology but I get it in, Chyeah
