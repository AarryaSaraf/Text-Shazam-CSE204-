The pages of a psychopath
And nowadays I never write 'em, just recite 'em, yeah
I put the lighter to the fire, and ignite it, yeah

"15"
"How the fuck you able to keep the count right when you're not able to do the book problem man?"
"Count be wrong, they'll fuck you up."

Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, ay nigga

Top down on a bitch when I ride by, I feel like fuck the law
Got diamonds in my rollie face I'm bout to cop an Audemar
My celly steady ringin', Freddie where your bales at?

Used to keep that .45 on my front seat when I serve a nigga

// Extradite //

The devil is a motherfuckin' liar
Straight kill 'em
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Here we come though

Took his order, then I served his quarter like five nickels
Man, I'll stay on point like icicle
Niggas can't decode, or figure my rhyme riddles
Took my money to the source, and said "Fuck the man in the middle"
Talkin' hard, soft, heroin, green, that's what we had boy
Erica was the bag lady, I was the bag boy
Option was that minimum wage, live in a cage
Buildin' a prison everyday, man they cultivatin' these slaves
In this new age, dude's wage is fugaz'
I'm the whole gallon and half pint like School Daze
I been killin' 'em, since Kool Moe Dee, Ra', Kool, 'Face
Zero dollars, zero tolerance, lettin' that tool bang, nigga

Yeah, nigga
And if the devil die today, I'mma treat it like it's a holiday
Bout the Michael Jackson, beat it, I mean it, I got a powder day
And nothin' funny, but I play with the money like it's Monopoly
And if the devil die today, I'mma treat it like it's a holiday

[Black Thought:]
I used to lay in bed, starin' at the ceilin' fan
Feelin' cramps, wishin' I could get a killer gram
Tryna understand, why I wanna kill a man
With high hopes like rubber tree, plants, and ants
We cheat death, with each breath, the only one who make -
It last forever is Keith Sweat, you ever see a -
Body lyin' dead, in the streets yet, then eat breakfast?
Swallow forced beliefs like police justice
If my city is like yours, then cereal scratch
Fingerprints is wiped off, if people seem to -
Always have somethin' to fight for, but still end up -
In the state pen, or the psych ward - It's lights off
They catch so many casualties; it's like war
That's the reason, I don't believe in the hype, y'all
The devil talkin' bout, he wanna extradite y'all
Now I'm the nigga, He shinin' the search light for

Yeah, nigga
And if the devil die today, I'mma treat it like it's a holiday
Bout the Michael Jackson, beat it, I mean it, I got a powder day
And nothin' funny, but I play with the money like it's Monopoly
And if the devil die today, I'mma treat it like it's a holiday

Here we come now, here we come now
Yeah, freestyle nigga

Homie showed me a 9 milli, and 9 nickel
Man, I'll stay on point like icicle
Say you got that yola, your fishscale lookin' fickle
They like Jordans out of the gas station, they ain't official
I got thousand dollar jeans, on my ass cheek
Cousin got her lights, and her gas cut last week
How that make me look, if I don't help her get up on her feet?
She keep a different nigga, now she in there, pregnant every week
I pray you, take these devils out our life, lord - That's our vice, lord
Baby momma's come with the drama, made her my wife lord
Know I'm doing, no hope you see I'm trying to do right, lord
Shake 'em up and blowin' the dice, I pray the price, lord, lord

Yeah, nigga
And if the devil die today, I'mma treat it like it's a holiday
'Bout the Michael Jackson, beat it, I mean it, I got a powder day
And nothin' funny, but I play with the money like it's Monopoly
Yeah, yeah, and if the devil die today, I'mma treat it like it's a holiday

[Black Thought:]
Yo, my memoirs are like the Anarchist's Cookbook
Meets the Tom Ford spring/summer look book
Some people wanna see me hanging from a good hook
Instead I hang with a language and slang in -
The anguish, and pain fit as well, cause it came with us
After all these years, carrying this shame with us
Now the entire planet, is going insane with us
Seven year old kids, carrying flame spitters
Fortified fences, mortify senses
Crossfire, miss my little daughter, by inches
Chemical dependence, medical expenses
But no amount of money on earth, can buy vengeance
Writing a life sentence, sirens, fire engines
Tyrants, seen through the eyes, of the wide lenses
Senseless crimes, cause some of us want to drive Benzes
But are you tryna ride with us, or against us?

[Louis Farrakhan:]
As long as they kill us
And go to Wendy's and have a burger and go to sleep
They gon' keep killing us
But when we die and they die
Then soon we gon' sit at a table, and talk about it, retired
We want some of this earth
Or we'll this goddamn country apart!
Assalamualaikum!

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, birds chirping in the morning

The name had me like you know what I'm sayin' checkin' for this
Then I started hearing you bustin' , I'm hearing you on this song
I heard you on the shit with BJ the Chicago Kid, I heard you on this
Oh, this nigga got flavor!

Thirty rounds for me
See them niggas runnin' up
Now lay it down for me
Foreign cars for all solid broads that I know

I'm bustin down a pack of that boy-boy in Chicago
You make it to a brick in my hood and you hit the lotto

Finna make a money shower fall on a ho
Smokin at the Trump Tower, bout to call a ho
Nigga finna make a money shower fall on a ho

There's something about a broad that like to suck her thumb
She on my shoes like a piece of gum
She know I'm not the two, I'm the one

I done did a lot of bad things just to get change
I done took it to some levels that a lot of niggas won't go
Take a life just to get a name
Came up with the crackheads, thugs and the cut-throats
Bloodshot from the blunt smoke
Man I'm so high I can't even look my own momma in the eyes
Kicked out through the front door
She said the way a nigga livin', if I die, she won't be surprised
Tears on the Bible, she prayed for me
This can't be the life that she made for me
Gotta lie to police when they raid for me
If there's a heaven will they open up the gates for me?
I wanted money for the summer, make a nigga trunk knock
Gang signs out the window screamin' out fuck cops
Soft dope, hard dope, get it all one stop
Slung crack rock, never had a wicked jump shot, yeah
Middle school, it was no joke
Hats broke to the right in the hall it was all folks
Good Lord, had to lay low
Had a .38, I kept it in my locker, you ain't even know
I wasn't from their hood so the Westside niggas ain't really have no reason to respect a nigga
And since I went to school with them motherfuckers
Niggas from my hood actin' like they ain't accept a nigga
All that I could do was dash out
Get a couple down niggas, put the mask on, cash out
Broad day with the strap out
Can't forget it, don't regret it, gave a nigga somethin' to rap about
All that I could do was dash out

Dope game, rap game, got a nigga stressed
Heavy smokin', everything is running through a check
Got me trippin', got me trippin off a nigga debt
Runnin' through a hundred bitches, who I'm doin next?
And my girl at the crib, got her own
She don't need a dog nigga like that
It be a hole in my motherfuckin' soul if see another nigga wife that
I like that, but it's like that
Steady tryin to keep my cool in a game full of fake niggas
Backstabbin' and snake niggas
Do a song with you, talk about you, smile in your face niggas
Shouts out to the nigga Snow
We was tryin' to take the world just like Tony and Manolo
But he shot me at the front door
He ain't want to see another nigga happy that's a no-no
All that I could do was dash out
Get a couple down niggas, put the mask on, cash out
Broad day with the strap out
Can't forget it, don't regret it, gave a nigga somethin' to rap about
All that I could do was dash out

[Hook:]
Tell the streets I've been down for a minute
Chop it up and let my real niggas finish
Had the kitchen or the stove, pockets on swole
Choppin' up them O's, I was gettin' it on the road
I was ready for whatever man
I remember I was sellin' things
I let it go, I let it go
Said I was ready for whatever man
With some niggas, they don't ever change
I let it go, I let it go

Yeah, Cadillacs, Impalas, nigga we ride Vogues
This for you pussy ass niggas and you weak ass hoes
I candy coat it, triple dip it, nigga, three times gold
Dip through in traffic, smoking dope, like I don't see 5-0
License to spend it, I was livin' ignorant
Careful blocking, pop some shots just to impress my niggas
Insecure about my looks, wouldn't pop it with the bitches
Rob and stole for diamond jewels, I thought I needed attention
Why I was starvin' for attention? All she wanted is my attention
All I wanna do is smoke and fuck her
Thug it out and keep shit undercover
Told myself that I would never love her
But I cuss her out, blow up her phone
Get mad if another nigga touch her
Insecure and in my motherfuckin' feelin's
Thought that I was chasin' money, I was chasin' bitches
But when the Lord gave me my daughter
Helped me paint the picture
Man all the shit I did, I'm blessed the streets ain't take a nigga
Nigga I stay

[Hook:]
Ready for whatever man
And some niggas, they don't ever change
I let it go, I let it go
And I remember I was sellin' things
I was ready for whatever man
I let it go, I let it go

Bentleys and Beamers, Impalas, Caprices
I scope up Diego, my nigga, we beepin'
My day run, we gang bang, we run off, we throw weight
I murder for my dogs, we eat off the same plate
We masked up, all my niggas masked up
Did a show in Brooklyn, niggas tried to get me blast up
Thought you was my nigga, hate to see me get my cash up
Then some niggas hit me, hollows almost tore my ass up
Your shooters was some actors
Actin' ass niggas
Scared to squeeze the trigger, some amateur ass niggas
Used to hit the road and get stacks of them cash with them
Only time I let me know when you were stabbed in the back nigga

[Hook:]
I remember we was sellin' things
Came to you, I'd do whatever man
I let it go, I let it go
I was ready for whatever man
I remember I was sellin' things
I let it go, I let it go
And I was ready for whatever man
With some niggas, they don't ever change
I let it go, I let it go, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Cadillacs, Impalas, nigga, we ride Vogues
Fuck you pussy ass niggas and you weak ass hoes
I candy coat it, triple dip it, nigga, three times gold
Dip through in traffic, smoking dope, like I don't see 5-0
License to spend it, I was livin' ignorant
Careful blocking, pop some shots just to impress my niggas
Insecure about my looks, wouldn't pop it with the bitches
Rob and stole for diamond jewels, I thought I needed attention
Why I was starvin' for attention? All she wanted is my attention
Fuck you bitches
All my daughter want is my attention
All she want is my attention, yeah
So why am I starvin' for attention?

Starvin' for attention

// Freddie Gordy //

Yeah, for sure nigga
We came from nothing nigga, from shit nigga
For real

Dolo and the pour
Got me tore up from the floor up
Gang signs, gang handshakes every time a nigga show up
All the real niggas know us
Back in '09 me and Lam we was looking for a way out
But ain't nobody want to show us
Riding round' selling blow, shotgun doors out his Volvo
Must have sowed a whole O up
And you stuck it out with me, I love you like a brother
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't have a record deal or nothing
I know you hate the fact that I'm so loyal to my street affiliation,
 but my niggas need a pack? I'm out here thuggin'
Willie and Diego need a pack? I'm out here thuggin'
My nigga Butter hit me for a pack? I'm out here thuggin'
And now the DEA they checking on me when I'm getting on a plane, 
double life it got me ducking under covers
I just want to be legit man, shit man
And every time I touch the dope I say that "this gonna' be my last flip man"
I got a shorty that's willing to sell it for me
She my lover, my homie, the devil cursed me with a pimp hand
I hope my daughter never lives this type of lifestyle
Creeping under street lights as a night child
My uncle still can't put the liquor or the pipe down
Meanwhile I'm in this kitchen whipping up the while gal
Plus I got addictions of my own, boy
The pills into laced blunts got me gone, boy
The Oxycontin & heavy syrup got me looking in the mirror saying, "Is you a dope fiend or a dope boy?"
Smoking on some shit that I can't pass to a nigga
Eyes shiny than a bitch, glass to a nigga
Down to kick in the door, .44 Mags to a nigga
Got some habits I pray that I never pass to a nigga
All about the dollar signs, fuck the sympathy
And fuck police cause' they killing you and killing me
Slanging and banging, my paper stay getting fatter so do black lives matter when you're about to kill your enemy?
I need to know it, drop that paper boy don't be heroic
You'll get a trip to see your Jesus if you're reaching for it
A real solid street nigga, never been extorted
You pussy niggas shouldn't be living, should have been aborted

[x2]
It's Freddie Kane, Freddie Corleone, Freddie Gordy
Just left the studio and served a birdie for the 40
I bet my niggas kill the witness if I get reported
The shit I spit is so realistic shouldn't be recorded

Dolo and the pour
Got me tore up from the floor up
Gang signs, gang handshakes every time a nigga show up
All the real niggas know us
