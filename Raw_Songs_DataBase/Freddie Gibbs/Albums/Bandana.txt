Droppin' this blow on the basement floor, my Yeezy's squeakin'
Reppin the fam, I pledge allegiance, undefeated
Fuck the 40 acres and a mule, they gave us niggas the eagle
Popeye spoons and needles
Sold a piece of crack to police it's Mario Van Peebles
Servin' every prom queen and Pookie with that vanilla smoothie
Scary Gary, nigga, my neighborhood somethin' like Fallujah
Vladimir banana clip, move with Russian colluder shooters
Fuck a track hoe, sellin' that pussy on computers
Pimpin'll never die, Timberland, have a trunk of dueces
Trunk of deuce of hard white fish, then I made a wish
A smoker scrubbin' down my kitchen, I'm never gon' wash a dish
It's Mr. Clean, Glass All, Palmolive
These niggas don't know how hard you ridin' for they ass 'til you park it
In 1998 I sold a Glock-19 chopper
2018, I'm finna reclaim my fuckin' time to cop the Rollie flooded Maxine Waters
Fuck your poison, keep your vaccines off us
We got a reality star in the God damn office
Quite like the Regan Days
Fernado said he used to move chickens in the Noriega days
I disrespect his name and he signed my face with the razor blade

Look, real bars are the ill bars
These scars are the only real proof they couldn't kill Gods
My coke hand is still sketching out my memoirs
What I did to door panels on them Windstars
Gem stars left cuts in the dinner plates
There's new stash spots, the AC don't just ventilate
Take over your blocks, young niggas assimilate
We all break bread, like goin' dutch on a dinner date
The love of your life, rap nigga with fake watches
The serial number don't match the gift boxes
The bezel on her Ballon Bleu do the Tinashe
The bitch told me two-tone Rollies was too blahzay (Yugh!)
Way more chemical than political
PTSD from what I weighed on the digital
It was snowfall and Regan gave me the visual
Obama opened his doors, knowing I was a criminal
I took a risk, I took a brick
Took a road trip to a Motel 6
Get it wholesale and you know I won't tell shit
Ride coat tails, then he really want that lit

[Outro:]
I know a guy in my neighborhood
He came home from work one day and caught his best friend in the hall with his wife
They had all day to go to bed
Pulled out a.45, shot both of 'em
Next morning, his friend went down to the jail
He said, "Fred, don't take it so hard"
He said, "It could have been worse"
He said, "What you mean, it could have been worse?"
He said, "Man, two people dead. I might get the electric chair. You tell me it could have been worse?"
He said, "Yeah, baby. It could have been worse."
He said, "What you mean?"
He said, "Hell, if you'd have came Thursday instead of Friday, you'd have gotten me too"

Found out some niggas fucked your wife and we put them bitches to sleep

Seen them niggas frown when I started breaking that shit down
Said I need more time with them chickens, I'm out here making rounds
Jealous niggas want they twenty-eight up front now
I bought all the damn clientele, we could have ran the town
But fuck it, you cut the price, then I fly to Phoenix
Said if you ain't copping like twenty, then, cocksucker, beat it
They put Yella Boy on the evening news
Devil on my shoulder said, "Fuck friends 'cause cash rules"

Shit's so real, gotta use fake names
Every time I sleep, dead faces, they occupy my brain, uh
Christina said I never changed (Never changed)
Lifestyles of the insane

Crackers came to Africa, ravaged, raffled, and rummaged me
America was the name of they fuckin' company
Stackin' niggas like cargo over and under me
Pick cotton bails and the coca leaf off the money tree
Niggas won't let you live in peace but love to see you rest in peace
Broke and poppin' and drinkin' on the rest, they got the best of me
I'm choppin' it up on the table, 'cause there wasn't no label gon' invest in me
These niggas'll ride your wave and wouldn't go sit that time in the fed with me
Eventually, when I got indicted I took a minus
Niggas that I fucked with went on hiatus so I decided
I should make a couple decisions like Sean made
A couple Jhené Aiko-lookin' hoes in the Sprinter thing
(They fuckin' with the Kane)
Black nigga, jack tripper, pack flipper
Step out the kitchen and step in the booth and drop heat on these rap niggas

Addicted to medication, just poured another line up
Overdosed with a styrofoam cup, how they gon' find us?

Fuck You Friday was such a great holiday
That I thought I would extend the holiday season
And let's call it I Don't Give A Shit Saturday
I don't give a shit about what you think about me
I don't give a shit about who you think I ought to be
I don't give a shit about, you don't like me cussin'?
I don't give a shit what you like
I'm doing what is best for me
I'm doing those things that makes me happy
Those things that I think are positive with me
And that's what you need to say to anyone today who comes into your life
Tryna bring negative shit into your life
Tell 'em, "I don't give a shit"
In fact, tell them, "If you not feedin' me, financing me, or fuckin' me, I just don't give a shit"
In fact, go out on this holiday
Get you some ribs, put it the grill
And let's call it Fuck-A-Que
Let's have a Fuck-A-Que holiday
And not give a shit about what people have to say about you and your life
This is your morning message from the cussing pastor
Have a great day

You trip on your management and your legal team
Uhh, I done been dropped before
Talked about and wrote off before
Heart on my sleeve and the ATF at my mama door
Mr. Mongol told me, "Freddie, fix up your posture, bro
Walk tall and never show niggas more than they gotta know"
Real Gs move in silence like Giannis
My Greek freak, we did a ménage with a friend in St. Thomas
From 50 karats in my pendant to change up the climate
We paint all the whips to cocaine white, decorate the garages
Kane

Ha, started with a nickel in my Tommy socks
Smokin' Blacks and gettin' sips of papa's Remy Martin
Boosted Polo out of Macy's in the Jansport (Hey)
Mama would have got me anything I asked for
In the city where they iffy on supportin' niggas (Hey)
Moved to L.A., started selling pounds of cauliflower (Hey)
Same niggas that I grew up sharin' shoes with (Hey)
Turned a limit to a multi-million dollar movement, bitch

Ice will come with the fame (Fame)
Flowers cover the grave (Cover all)
Power, love, and loyalty (Aw, yeah)
Wash me clean (Wash me clean, yeah)

'Caine all in the blood (Uh-huh)
Shots to the brain, Snow on tha Bluff (Uh-huh)

Bodies hit the pavement, money came for months
'Caine paid the bills (Uh-huh)
Penthouse the suite, sugar on the hill (Uh-huh)
Some will get f- but most will get killed (Uh-huh)
I'm just doin' me, and me, I'm doin' still (I'm doin' still)

Apne pichhe

// Practice //

Yeah
I had it all
This one, that one
I thought it was tight, tight new situation
But you know what I mean, I'm fooling myself, you know what I'm saying?

Yeah, yeah, my nigga, I'm what she paid for
She 'bout to get off work at the club, I used to wait for her
Fucking up my whole family structure to clear the day for her
When I was going through problems at home, I should have prayed more
Dear Lord, but I didn't
So I'm tangled in this position
Made a commitment to both of these women and never considering both of they feelings
I got too deep so after I beat I should've just deaded it from the beginning
'Cause I admit that I got a bit jealous when she was at Floyd crib stripping
And that ain't like me, this ain't the right me, but that ain't her fault
She call my phone with all the tough talk, I went the fuck off
Wasn't seeking another relationship, I just needed to duck off
Got a cool new bitch in the boonies, that pussy, I knock the dust off
When all the trust lost
Sometimes the love is soon to follow
Wifey'll put me out the crib and tell me to come back home tomorrow
When I got caught the fuck up, she hit me with the ultimatum
You need to come home with your daughter, nothing more important than your baby
Drugs got me crazy

Uh, yeah
You know what I'm sayin', nigga?
Shit's crazy, man
Selling dope, smoking dope, you know what I'm saying, all that
All that shit, being around shit, yeah
Push you to the limit, you know what I mean?
Or you past the limit, you know what I mean?
These streets and these hoes don't love you
You don't feel no love out here, nigga

Get it, like Meech and Slick say, but she no comprende
When I'm chopping shit up like a sensei to get to rent day
My trunk got more blocks than Dikembe
The DEA, they snatched my black ass straight up out of first class flying from Midway (Damn)
One foot in rap, one foot in the trap
But I'm really trapping for my homies, they too incompetent for this balancing act
If they really love me, they'd be keeping me from it, to keep it a hundred
How you complain about the price when you getting everything fronted?
Weed, heroin and 'caine flips was my main bitch
She tried to make me go to counseling but that ain't change shit
Searching for licks up in the streets, they come and go like Pokémon
Don't get no R-E-S-P-E-C-T from my baby mama's mom
Put some respect up on my name like Beatrice, men in a mattress
Fake love, I really don't need it like Allen ain't need the practice
Hell yeah nigga, we talking about practice
How I'm gonna break up with the streets?
I got the questions but I can't find the answers
Delicate circumstances

Yeah
It's gon' be alright though
Have the bitches there, you know what I'm sayin'?
At the end of the day, yeah
Instagram, Snapchat get you locked up
Hard to sit in the city and shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
Niggas and these bitches
Ain't no love in this situation at all, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, uh

// Cataracts //

Yeah, check, check, yeah, uh
Chillin' in my, uh, uh
Chillin' in my, chillin' in my, uh
Chillin' in my, chillin' in my, uh
Chillin' in my, chillin' in my, uh

Old school
Chevy thang, Cadillac
Smokin' on that good, good
Good for my cataracts
Fuckin' up this bad food
Fast food, gettin' fat
Nine, extended clip attached
Swingin' it like a battle axe
Livin' la vida broke-a
Fuckin' these smokers up and baggin' crack
Antonio Montana dream
Mama wasn't havin' that
Niggas ain't know no better
We fuck 'em and pass 'em
We was passin' rats
Bitch, you wet my 'Wood up
Dry my shit off 'fore you pass it back

Bitch, pass it back, pass the Act'
Codeine got me passin' out
Crown mix it with cranberry
Tryna see what that about
'Member we hit that lick and tied up them Crips in that Atlanta house
Had to smoke that nigga that came along with us 'cause he was gon' rat us out
Seem like my actions was devil sin, I can't sympathize
Fuck generation next, this generation genocide
Your social stat make you fantasize about a homicide
To me, the guy that lie is the black man personified
Anticipatin' and killin' my own in search of wealth
Should he come knockin' at the door of your home, you know, for death
Knew the Lord was in the room when my daughter took her first breath
Cold turkey on the dope, had to gain the knowledge of self

In my old school
Chevy thang Cadillac
Good, good
Good for my cataracts
Bad food
Fast food, gettin' fat
Nine, extended clip attached
Swingin' it like a battle axe

I'm chillin' in my old school
Chevy thang, Cadillac
Smokin' on that good, good
Good for my cataracts
Fuckin' up this bad food
Fast food, gettin' fat
Nine, extended clip attached
Swingin' it like a battle axe
Livin' la vida broke-a
Fuckin' these smokers up and baggin' crack
Antonio Montana dream
Mama wasn't havin' that
Niggas ain't know no better
We fuck 'em and pass 'em
We was passin' rats
Bitch, you wet my 'Wood up
Dry my shit off 'fore you pass it back

Wish I could put that pussy off in my pockets, I would leave with that
Hit my after your cycle, I need that pussy with no string attached
Fiendin' to get it, won't hit it, against my religion, a nigga won't bleed for that
You lucky enough to get you a nigga with morals, you needed to heed to that
Turkey bacon, bitch, like my toast buttered on both sides
Chevy dipped in liquid cocaine, my Casper the Ghost ride
I let some people go from my company and they sold out
I know that they jumpin' straight into Hell, I pray that they nosedive
Mama said don't leave out the house if you ain't got Jesus with you
Last Supper, you might get fucked by niggas that's eatin' with you
Side bitch was trippin', I fucked but won't spend the evening with her
My baby mama switched up her diet, I'ma go vegan with her
Father, please deliver us niggas, carnivorous niggas
I walk amongst the dumb, deaf, and blind, and them frivolous niggas
And dope, rap, and basketball punchin' a ticket for niggas
You put it in the book then I guess you done hid it from niggas

I'm chillin' in my old school
Chevy thang, Cadillac
Smokin' on that good, good
Good for my cataracts
Fuckin' up this bad food
Fast food, gettin' fat (New shit)

Mashallah, rest in peace to Tha Jacka
Paradise, the next life, I'll see you in the hereafter
I'm in that ebony Instagram, my nigga was mad I ain't smashin'
Nigga, I don't need you for the feature, really don't fuck with no rapper
I don't got no problem with these niggas wearin' they dresses and skirts
When you pop up with an opinion and drag your name through the dirt
On the Day of Judgement, niggas gon' pay for they dirt
Including me
Couldn't push my boat through the lake of fire 'cause my paddles was burnt
Uncle was smokin' that work
Can't come in the crib, I serve you through the gate
Smell the dope off in the air
Jimmy Duggan, shake and bake
Used to walk a dog with H
In and out, Empire State
'68 Chevalle, don't need no Bentley truck or fuckin' Wraith
2014, addicted to lean, I was depressed as fuck
Duckin' shots and wonderin' if my own niggas set me up
And if they knock me down, I wonder would one of my niggas help me up?
Pockets, they finger-lickin', they honey kettle chicken, breaded up
Bitch, get your bread up, bitch
I say my pockets, they finger-lickin', honey kettle chicken, breaded up, bitch

This that new shit
Madlib, that new shit
Takin' over, new king, woo
Let that shit ride out
You better pray twice, nigga

// Gat Damn //

Yeah, pour some liquor, yeah, yeah, yeah
Free my niggas, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pour some liquor, yeah, yeah, yeah
(This shit, nigga, for real though), yeah

Man, I miss my nigga Greg, pour some liquor, yeah, yeah
I got homies in the feds, free my niggas, yeah, yeah
I just wrapped a hundred cash, zipped it in the air, yeah
I'ma go fuck up a bag, know that ho can't stand that
Yeah, I got shooters but I'm duckin' shooters
Pop 'em up, they hit the homie sister, guess we both the loser
Po-po pull me over with a half a kilo and a Ruger
I can't move the same, I gotta readjust how I maneuver

I reminisce that feeling when I think about it
A million in the bank, I used to dream about it
No heat up in the whip, I used to sleep up out it
Up in the morning whippin' cocaina 'bout it, yeah, yeah
I got bags, ho, is you fuckin' with me? Yeah, yeah
Time to blast, ho, is you fuckin' with me? Yeah, yeah
Let that yayo dry on the table, droppin' fat slabs
Porsche Spyder look like a spaceship, they like, "Goddamn"

Ah, goddamn, I'm callin' Lam'
MoneyGram, go send the bail, I'm in a jam
In the jail, I'm in the cell, can't see the fam
Say my prayers, alhamdulillah, no bacon ham
Bacon ham, and cold salami, that's all they serve us
Stomach hurtin', the devil working, but I ain't nervous
Beat the verdict, but lost a milli', guess life ain't perfect
Whippin' birdies, the devil working, but I ain't nervous

I reminisce that feeling when I think about it
A million in the bank, I used to dream about it
No heat up in the whip, I used to sleep up out it
I take the pot and whip a Cuban link up out it, yeah, yeah
I got bags, ho, is you fuckin' with me? Yeah, yeah
We can blast, ho, is you fuckin' with me? Yeah, yeah
Let that yayo dry on the table, droppin' fat slabs
Porsche Spyder look like a spaceship, they like, "Goddamn"

You know, pent down in that motherfucker, yeah
I remember I was on, on bail and shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
This, this, damn, the beat ran out
Fuck it, that's enough right there
Fuck it, I ain't even gotta talk no shit

// Education //

[Intro:]
Ooh Maisha T, aaj pehli baar tum ne kaam ki baat ki hai
Education

[Yasiin Bey:]
They go in one way, they come out crazy
Peace preparatory school, emperors and conquerors
Pharaohs and followers
Goblins and monsterers
Stone heart jewels and gold for the fools
The bones of the innocent is buckles on they boots
The jail overcrowded, they emptied out the school
See the devil twitchin', ears itchin' from the truth
Strange fruit, cyanide, soufflé, and soup
It's tasty for a few and murder for the group
A dead-end street with a lemonade stand
Where is the sky in upside down land?
That question is hard if you can't see the stars
I'm really not sure, ask me tomorrow
I may not be here
I'm feelin' like I might just leave before I start a fire or a fight
Or both, but nah, son, I couldn't just chill
Everybody gigglin', that kid was gettin' killed
And I knew when I stood they would turn on me
And I don't need no more trouble with my sleep
So I did what I did and that's what it is
Tell the sheriff and the deputy I don't give a fick
Tell my mama and my kin and all of y'all and them, it's like this
Get free and stay sick
And that's it
An education

[Black Thought:]
Peace parishioners, onlookers, and listeners
Visitors keepin' the consumption conspicuous
Kids graduatin' from public schools and prisoners
Underprivileged, aboriginal, indigenous
Sent images of that family that got adopted
The president of some nonprofits is out of pocket
I heard the world ending is trendin', I tried to watch it
I focused on sinnin' when winnin' was not an option
The system we compete against is farm to table hand
Pickin' them ingredients, civil disobedience
Encyclopedia, definition of greediness
Gluttony, please take heed of who you treaty with
Me, Freddie, Flaco, and Shot never forgot though
That Plymouth Rock landed on top of new Morocco
Couldn't see who was firin' shots, the shooter got low
And left a burnin' cross on the lawn just like a pothole
I may not be here
I'm feelin' like I might just leave before I start a fire or a fight
They sayin the six bands are higher for the flight
So I may be a hitman for hire for the night
If you're figurin' this man's maniacal, you're right
Bar codes on the wristband, it's not an oversight
They intentionally expand, probably to extradite
If you wanna play blind, just look straight into the light
The puppeteers playin' you for spite
And worldwide, what we're payin' is the price
And that's life
An education

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Wooden leather buck talk
China white with cut talk
Kane train, a ho could never put me in a Slut Walk
Education, trap-onomics, narcotic plug talk
My hands was right back in the birds soon as they took the 'cuffs off
Gotta feed your fuckin' wolves or they gon' feed on a nigga
It's quite ironic how all this ice'll keep the heat on a nigga
My cousin beat me for a pack and I put the beam on a nigga
And I don't gotta finesse the plug because I Deebo that nigga
Used to be peace and O's, drop am opp like pop's stinky load
Last Friday hit by the pos, too dope in the commode
Got off the stove and slowed my role, I'm in the mosque now
But I'll still serve you a baked potato Bobby Johnson style
You ain't lit, you litter like Trump Twitter feed
Black mobster shit, I'm more Melvin Willams than Genevieve's
Them fist fights had me swappin' blood with my enemies
You ain't from no set if you wasn't gangbangin' in Little League
I may not be here
I'm feelin' like I might just leave before I start a fire or a fight
A million fuckin' dollars a year just won't suffice
Got a factor in that more bad habits and the cost of life
Cost of life, uh
We stay so high, that's why we can't come up
My credit score is zero, I'm still pullin' Ranges up
Them cash counters is counteractive
The paper cuts gas by a pump like when Dominque used to lace some up
I changed it up, I pray the streets don't take what's left of me
Drugs for the free, soul sold separately
Education

// Soul Right //

Smooth, nigga, you know what I'm sayin'?
Too motherfuckin' smooth, bitch, yeah
Bald head, head like a baby, a baby ass, bitch, yeah
Yeah, Kane
Here to motherfuckin' remain, yeah
Uh, bitch nigga
It's still fuck police, too
Yeah, nigga, yeah

Rest in peace Terrence Crutcher, motherfuck Betty Shelby (Fuck that bitch)
I never wish death but bitch, find a hollow tip and inhale it
When Taz drove off with two kilos, I told him we should mail it
And now we gone up the river, they seen my nigga sellin'
Nigga killed the police in Dallas, that's probably fake news
While they knock 'em off with robotics, R2D2's
Everything on me icy, Snow White, it's just like I skiied through
I sit back in the trap with them rats and I watch the cheese move
Shakin all these nutso niggas off the roof, off the record
Ball without a motherfuckin' ball like I was Tommy Sheppard
Life a bachelor party, we with them strippers on O's and X's
I can't hold no grudges, my hands is too busy catching blessings, yeah

Yeah, and I been struggling my whole life, yeah
I pour it up and get my soul right

East side boy, my mama was the mail lady (Yeah)
Brother and my sister got degrees but I got the yayo, baby (Yeah)
Had to beat my case, I can't turn Irie to a jail baby
Bitch, I weigh that shit up in my crib, I think your scale shady
Pass it off and drop it like Stockton, bitch, I facilitate
Fucked some niggas off but I also done set some niggas straight
Way back when we had rows and Lincolns is all a nigga ate
And every day I fuck up a bulletproof glass chicken plate, uh
Empty stomach, broken heart, and empty pocket
Three things that occur to show you if you and your niggas solid
Know that they won't prosper but the devil still gon' form the weapon
I can't hold no grudges, my hands is too busy catching blessings, yeah (Blessings, blessings)

Yeah, and I been struggling my whole life, yeah
Yeah, I pour it up and get my soul right, yeah
'Cause I been struggling my whole life, yeah
So I broke it down and it was all white, yeah
Mama always told me it'd be alright, yeah
I still broke it down and it was all white, yeah
I pray the Lord'll get my soul right, yeah
I still pray to Lord'll get my soul right
