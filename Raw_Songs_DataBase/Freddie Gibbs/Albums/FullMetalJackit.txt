Album: FullMetalJackit

// Full Metal Jacket Jump Off //

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Yo, before my grandfather died he told me: "if you ain't gon' shit, get off the pipe"
And I ain't know what he meant right then and there but I guess he sayin': "you gon' do som', do it one hunnid percent or don't do nothin' at all"
When I was 19 I started doin' this rap shit and I be killin' it ever since
It's time to unload on y'all niggas
Yeah, uh
I know y'all used it already, uh
But y'all didn't rip it like Freddie, uh
Yeah, Freddie gangsta
Here we go, Full Metal Jackit, here we go

Ayo, dipset, dipset, nah Freddie rips sets
Snatch jewels off your neck, leave your clique wet
Y'all flow drive but my flow's is liquid
Let this fluid run in yo' veins and get addicted
I'm a crook nigga, I smack niggas with' scraps
And crack niggas with' gats and jack niggas for tracks
You dudes talk shit, tryna mentally haze me
But those cheap shots never could phase me, they could never amaze me
Your bullshit never could move me
You gassed off gangsta flicks, you live in the movies
This nigga was talkin' shit until I pulled my weapon
Shot him in the park, now he's a playground legend
Ugh, that nigga Freddie Gibbs doin' boys ugly
Illest in the cheese, other rappers can't touch me
You thinkin' otherwise, go against some other guys
They don't wanna battle me, they stomach filled with' butterflies
You can't label my music as just "urban"
I touch a lot of people like I'm preachin' a sermon
Spittin' sick is a gift, I've been blessed by the lord
Been the illest since they snipped my umbilical cord nigga

[Finger Roll (Freddie Gibbs):]
Yo, what the fuck is up man? (preach)
Gary, Indiana, Chi-Town man (tell 'em som')
Y'all know better represent my boy Freddie Gibbs spittin' that hot shit (let's go)
Come on

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Yo, I'm the deal so a lot of labels wanna recruit me
I got rank in the game nigga, you should salute me
Stand at ease when I rap, it's a breeze when I rap
You fat, you can barely fuckin' breathe when you rap
I ain't the biggest dude but my rhymes push a lot of weight
Go and do some exercise, lyrically you outta shape
But on the other hand, I'm nicely built
So on or off the mic you might get killed
I swear to God you don't want no part of me
I spit that sick shit that clog yo' arteries
I have yo' ass gaspin', holdin' yo' chest
And leave yo' body in a state of cardiac arrest woah
Rap for you is a waste of time
Ain't nobody gon' buy you like that P-Miller clothing line
Or an album from No Limit
This is no gimmick, when I spit it's so prolific
I ain't worried about these local cats
I only listen to a lil' bit of local rap
Cause these cats try to diss you behind ya back
But they really want you to rap one of they tracks ha
Nah, I listen to a couple of dudes but fuck rap man I'd rather bump rhythm and blues
Like some Isley Brothers, some Frankie Beverly and Maze, a little Stevie Wonder, or some Marvin Gaye
Ugh, you talkin' shit I ignore you chumps
No Tamin' and we ain't got no love for punks
And you know that we be makin' them hits
Finger Roll make the beat, I write the rhymes while I'm takin' a shit
Then I, hit the booth and I'm ready to spit
Freddie the shit, all the bitches on my dick
Cause I shine and they see me glow
Bitches wanna give me ass cause the see me on the T.V. show
Man just wait until my album drop
I'ma have this whole city on lock, cause my album's hot
And I know that y'all been waitin' a while
So I'mma hit you with this Full Metal Jackit like Private Pyle, ugh

[Finger Roll:]
Yo, what the fuck is up
If you don't know what the fuck is up then back the fuck up
Full Metal Jackit blastin' at y'all niggas for the 2004
Freddie Gibbs, Finger Roll lacin' this shit, holdin' it down
Puttin' ya voices on his that hot shit
Shit's hot man, but y'all go ahead and chillout man
I'mma go take a shit, holla at ya boy man
Freddie Gibbs, 2-double-O-4 ya lil bitch
Ugh, muthafucka

// Oh Freddie //

But, it's all good though you know
This dedicated to all the ladies, all the ladies that love Freddie
You know, I love y'all too, know what I'm sayin'?

Bitch freeze, hell nah you ain't my main chick
I keep you sprung off dick because my game's sick
And every time you approach me it's the same shit
I'm settin' my mind frame, I ain't gon' change it
You think that I'mma go out and have a meal witchu
Or drive downstate just to chill witchu
Nah, I ain't gon' waste my gas
I'll take you to a restaurant so you can waste my cash
You'll be tellin' all ya friends that you think you in love with me
Just because I hit it and you smoked some bud with me
Yo' nigga said he saw you up in the club with me
And when he see me he gon' bust some slugs at me
But I ain't worried 'bout a thing, just break me off a lil bit of change
I'll slide with' another dame
Cause Freddie don't go on dates with' sluts
But we can pick another date to fuck, know what I'm sayin'? come on

I got a lot of bitches on my jock
They be callin' me around the clock
Oh Freddie

But I love it when they say my name
Oh Freddie
Freddie, Freddie can I be yo' girl?
Freddie can I be a part of yo' world?
Oh Freddie

I'm 6 foot 2, I weight about two-hundred pounds
Dark-skinned, pretty eyes and a nice white smile
But, don't let the pretty face fool you bitch
If you ain't hip to the game I'll school you bitch
I'm a rich woman's lover and a poor woman's dream
Plus I got a couple bad bitches on my team
Like Sheila, Maya, Brandy, Tisha, Jennifer, Mia, Candy, and Alicia
I got this chick name Honey, she a dime
I treat her wrong cause I don't respect her mind
Lotta niggas wanna hit it cause they know she a dime piece
Man, you should see all the shit she be buyin' me
Cause to keep me around ya gotta spoil me
Treat me like a king, rub my feet like I'm royalty
Cause if you do I might treat you the same

// I Don't Know Your Name //

Ugh, damn
Yo, it's the top of the mornin'
And I'm just wakin' up, breath stinkin' and yawnin'
Ugh, last night I performed at a show
Now I'm laid up with this chick I don't know
All I know is I was drinkin' on Red Bull and Hennessy
Then you approached me and said you was feelin' me
Plus you said you had some weed to spark
So I took you to my room at the Adams Mark
Ugh, you was just another chick that I left with'
Had sex with' real quick and I slept with'
And I know that it's a God damn shame
But baby girl I don't remember yo' name
What's yo' name again?

I'm for real man I don't be rememberin' these girls' names dog
You don't know my name
For real, if I remember yo' name you special

I'm sorry, you know what I'm sayin'?
You don't know my name
Round and round and round we go, will you ever know?
This is Freddie Gibbs, this is how I am

Yo, I remember yo' name, is it Dana, Lisa, or Amanda?
Erica, Tiffany, Neisha, or Cassandra
She said: "no, my name is Tiana"
Go call them other bitches' names out to yo' mama
Woah, baby girl let's be friends not enemies
You can't get mad cause I got a bad memory
But now it's checkout time, so baby check this
Get dressed, I'mma take you to breakfast
And maybe we can come back to the tele
We can roll another blunt and listen to R. Kelly
Then we can do the same thang again
But baby girl what's yo' name again?
I forgot, ugh

It feels like ooh-ooh-ooh
You don't know my name
I'm sorry you know what I'm sayin'?
I was drunk, I was drinkin' that Henn-dog
And I swear it baby
It feel like ooooo
It was me, Ivoe, [?] you was talkin' to all of us
You don't know my name
Round and round and round we go, will you ever know
They don't, they don't know yo' name either
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm sayin', he don't even know what he's doin' to me
Yes I do
I be feelin' all crazy inside, I'm feelin' like
I do?, haha, yeah, come on

Doin' more than I've ever done for anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you
Cause did I mention you're 'bout to miss a good thing
And you'll never know how good it feels to have all of my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience my lovin'
Cause my lovin' feels like ooooo
You don't know my name

You tell me one more time I'm gon' remember it, I promise
Round and round and round we go, will he ever know?
And I swear it feel like ooooo
For real?
You don't know my name
I'm tellin' you, when I get-. when I'm off that green and that drink
Round and round and round we go, will he ever know?
You know, I be, I be forgettin' stuff

// Set It Off //

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Aight, aight, aight, aight that's enough of them songs for the bitches and shit
Let's jump into some heavyweight gangsta shit, yeah

[*adlibs*]

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Yo I'm a heavyweight soldier, Indiana Hoosier
You don't wanna throw them thangs cause I'll bruise ya
You don't wanna battle on wax, I'll misuse ya
You might as well take it to gats, get ya ruger
I walk like a pimp cause I got them hoes
I'm arrogant on the mic cause I got them flows
When I'm spittin' I set a track on fire
Now these major labels gotta show me the money like Jerry MaGuire (show me the money man)
And my team comin' hard, is these rap guys ready?
I'm the most valuable player, call me "Franchise Freddie"
Still broadcastin' live from gangsta Gary
Preachin' you the word like I'm in a sanctuary
I'm the illest nigga in the game, ain't no denyin' it
I'm sick enough to bring Jigga out of retirement
It's Freddie Gangsta Gibbs, the boss in this muthafucka
Me and Lil Rod set it off in this muthafucka

[Rod:]
You should call me clockwork cause I got perfect timing
Look under my fingernail, bitch my work is grindin'
Worth supplyin'. man I leave that to the others
I got the best of both worlds, nigga folks and brothers
Woah, I'm too hot, nigga cool me off
You might be hard but yo' muthafuckin' dudes is soft
Dude ya lost, ya muthafuckin' mind or som'
Don't make me go ahead and push that muthafuckin' panic button
Hoosier state, heavyweight, yeah ya heard it before
And through this whole mixtape you gon' hear some more
Because I'm here to change the game, change ya ways
I'm like Samuel L. Jackson changin' lanes
I'm sick of dudes thinkin' this is a game
I'mma treat 'em like a old pair of glasses and change they frame
Change your name, relocate and get the fuck outta ours country
Bitches couldn't see me like I'm wearin' camouflage

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Camouflaged up, full metal jackit
Rappers can't handle the pressure, they can't hack it

[Rod:]
And if you can then you killin' yo'self
I'm like tweak cause my rhymes got me feelin' myself

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Man Rod, these other rap cats don't measure up
They thinkin' they the stuff they ain't fuckin' with' us

[Rod:]
I'll tell you what, I bet you couldn't pay 'em to diss me
Because they sixteens suck like M. Lewinsky

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Heavyweights, we get that groupie love, that's how we live
We get these bitches they groove back like Taye Diggs

[Rod:]
And I don't play with' kids, shit you gotsta shag
I'll have yo' top lip lookin' like "got milk?" ad

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Two of Indiana's finest and we up in the buildin'
And ya town's shutdown, hide ya women and children

[Rod:]
Kill the civilians, if you in the way you can get it
I think you need to invest in a bulletproof fitted
Bitch set it off

[Smokey B:]
Yeah this ya boy Smokey B, the CEO of this shit muthafucka
You thought I wasn't gonna get on this muthafuckin' track?
Boy you done lost yo' muthafuckin' mind
I'm a muthafuckin' [?] boy
Hoosier state, heavyweights in this muthafucka for life bitch
And fuck all you niggas that don't give a fuck about No Tamin'
Ya muthafuckin' bitch, I'm out this muthafucka
Smokey B ya bitch

// Quick 2 Back Down Freestyle //

Ugh, yeah, ugh
Freddie gangsta Gibbs
Ugh, Gary, Indiana's finest
Man, lotta y'all rappers better be quick to back down ugh
Man, Finger Roll I'm 'bout to kill it man
I'm about to kill this beat man
Here we go, ugh, yeah
You want it come get it, ugh, yo

Anybody that wants some gets some
I am rap royalty and this is my kingdom
Indiana, man the whole Midwest is mine
I pack a vest and a nine so the rest is dyin'
The rest is lyin', talkin' 'bout they street credibility
I represent the hoods so the whole hood feelin' me
And if they don't they paralyzed till death
And it there's any left, I'mma terrorize the rest
You dudes get ludicrous, act a fool
Cross me and you get smoked like a pack of kools
I'm real and I ain't got no deal
But I'm the only all-star from Indiana like Jermaine O'Neal
Man don't cross my squad
You mess with' Finger Roll or Rod and you get found dead in your garage
It's Freddie Gibbs the God, the Indiana playmaker
Gettin' on with' lyrical left hooks and haymakers
I borrow yo' ear like [?]
But this year y'all cats gon' feel more Gibbs
Gettin' straight to the source, you know what I mean?
My guns double XL, I murder dog like the magazine
And you can take it how ya wanna take it
But I'm ready for hard labor like a chick when her water breakin'
I'm unemployed so I'm bumpin' them raps
I make my money on the block, buck punching a clock
I'd rather punch you for ya watch, ya chain, ya wallet
My flow is like Ashford and Simpson, rock solid
I sold dope outta my dorm room in college
I slung weight at Ball State, [?]
I'm comin' off the top of my dome, I drop knowledge
Plus I got them guns if you wanna get brolic
My dudes got them bullets that be rippin' up vests
Puttin' holes in yo' throwback Mitchell & Ness
Freddie Gibbs is the illest, I be spittin' the best
And I ain't got no competition cause I'm killin' the rest
And I'mma keep spittin' flows 'till they put me to death
Won't stop if the cops put me under arrest
I'm white t-shirt Nike'n it, got green, lightin' it
In the 'lac, bumpin' Jigga, hard knock life'n it
You got som' to say, shut ya trap
Homie wait until I finish my rap
Okay I'm done, go 'head nigga

Ugh, yeah, dude go 'head
Say whatchu gotta say now homie
Yeah, it's No Tamin'
Eh, ugh, Heavyweights
Yeah, ugh, ugh, yeah

// Indiana Flute Freestyle //

Man, these niggas don't think I got it dog
Only been spittin' three years, I got these niggas out here faded dog
You know what I'm sayin' man? smokey man
Yeah I'mma give 'em a little somethin' man, know what I'm sayin'?
Alright, heavyweight style is how we do it, one take
Yo, uh-uh, yo

All hail to black Caesar bitch
I'm known for bein' known to straight leave a bitch
Known for playin' ball, wasn't known for flowin'
I always had this talent, y'all niggas was never knowin'
I'm showin' you real life, spittin' the real lyrics
Black America hear it, white America fear it
But white kids, they love it, gotta run out and buy it
Yo whether I'm slangin' tapes or dope they gotta try it, niggas can't deny it
Comin' from Indiana, the rap Craig Williamson
I'm hittin' 'em with the hammer
My rhymes is organized, my state of mind triflin'
Call me Mr. Freeze, my flow is cold like Iceland
Yo' flows inadequate, real niggas ain't havin' it
I'll niggas like me is the wrong niggas to battle with'
Rhymin' above average, respect my skill
And gets your lights put out, like a unpaid electric bill, bitch

Yo, I wish a muthafucka would try to take my cash
I wish a muthfucka would come and whoop my ass
I wish a muthafucka would try to fuck my chick
Nah go ahead, I don't give a fuck about no bitch
I'm so gangsta, niggas ask me: "Freddie what set you claim?"
I got guerrillas on my team and I don't need no gang
Not a disciple or a lord, not a crip or a blood
I don't gotta throw gang signs to show you I'm a thug
Finger Roll sendin' me to bring home the bacon
Cause he know that Freddie Gibbs is a legend in the makin'
I'm takin', the midwest up to the top
If you don't ride with' me you get left on the block
Yo I ain't like these other cats, I'm doin' it real major
Y'all dudes old news like yesterday's paper
So whatchu wanna do? rap or fight
I challenge any muthafucker, whether ya black or white
Oh, and Spanish niggas, you can get it too
When you open la puerta Freddie Gibbs'll deck ya
Feelin' on ya girl's tetas, up in la chocha
Then I get her on the floor and make her open la boca and it's over bitch

// Dealing With My Addiction //

My flow so traumatic, I'm down to cause static
My producer got more tracks than a heroin addict
But he sorta like a dope man
Cause when he gimme my fix, I'm sinkin' in an abyss, that's what I need to exist
Cause I'm a junkie, a fiend for rap, a fiend for tracks
I'm hooked, like a fiend for crack
I want the world to get hooked on my spiritual rhymes
So go ahead, take a hit, snort these lyrical lines
Let 'em penetrate ya brain, without it I'd be insane
Rap made a nigga change, I ain't never been the same
Now my mama and my daddy think I'm crazy, loc'd out
The mic is like a pipe and the booth is a dope house
When I'm throwin' I'm satisfied
Give up rappin', kick the habit? no I'd rather die
Rap is like a controlled substance cause it really give me a buzz
So if you ain't got the love then you should say no to drugs, wut

I got this monkey on my back and I can't shake it
I need a daily dose or I don't think that I'mma make it
These beats and rhymes support my habit
Cause I need it, I gotta have it, gotta grab it, I'm a rap addict
I got this monkey on my back and I can't shake it
I need a daily dose or I don't think that I'mma make it
These beats and rhymes support my habit
Cause I need it, I gotta have it, gotta grab it, I'm a rap addict

And I ain't always rapped, I been rappin' since I was nineteen
Now I'm twenty-one, this is more than just a pipe dream
I think of rhymes while I'm rollin' down the street
I rap all day, I even rap in my sleep
I rap while I'm in the bed, rap when I wake up
I'm heavy in this rap shit, nigga get ya weight up
I'm addicted to spittin' flows, ain't no rehabilitation
And if you battle me, prepare for your elimination
Cause I don't really think you gifted like me
You ain't on my level, you ain't addicted like me
I eat, sleep, and breathe this rap shit
Cause I'm a professional, but you muthafuckas need some practice
Y'all niggas should appreciate this talent I'm givin' y'all
The game's in pain, I'm 'bout to kill it like demerol
I do it for the streets, keep it gully on a track
I'm addicted to rap, can't get this monkey off my back

I got this monkey on my back and I can't shake it
I need a daily dose or I don't think that I'mma make it
These beats and rhymes support my habit
Cause I need it, I gotta have it, gotta grab it, I'm a rap addict
I got this monkey on my back and I can't shake it
I need a daily dose or I don't think that I'mma make it
These beats and rhymes support my habit
Cause I need it, I gotta have it, gotta grab it, I'm a rap addict

Yeah, I need it, gotta have it, I'm a rap addict
Cause I need it, I gotta have it, I'm a rap addict
I know I need it, gotta have it, I'm a rap addict
I know I need it, gotta have it, I'm a rap addict
I know I need it, gotta have it, I'm a rap addict
I know I need it, gotta have it, I'm a rap addict
I know I need it, gotta have it, I'm a rap addict
I know I need it, gotta have it, I'm a rap addict

This is my mind, body, and soul, my pain, my love
This is my lyrical addiction, my brain on drugs
Hip hop came in my life and shook my world
My dedication to this music made me lose my girl
She sayin' I don't spend quality time
Cause I'm hooked on hooks, addicted to beats, and quality rhymes
And I'm never gonna stop, I'mma be the one to flow the most
Rap 'till I'm comatose, die from a overdose

I got this monkey on my back and I can't shake it
I need a daily dose or I don't think that I'mma make it
These beats and rhymes support my habit
Cause I need it, I gotta have it, gotta grab it, I'm a rap addict
I got this monkey on my back and I can't shake it
I need a daily dose or I don't think that I'mma make it
These beats and rhymes support my habit
Cause I need it, I gotta have it, gotta grab it, I'm a rap addict

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Yo, ugh, yo man, I lo-, I love writing raps man, spittin' over tracks man, this shit is just, it's too easy man
You know what I'm sayin'?
It's my bread and butter, you know what I'm sayin'?
My fish and bread, you know what I mean?
It's hot man I just, feel like this
Ugh, alright let 'em know

Yo, yo fish and bread keep the poor man fed
But that lobster and shrimp, that's the meal for a pimp
A sandwich ain't a sandwich without miracle whip
And the track ain't on fire 'til I spit my shit

Lay my verse, show my game
I don't gotta keep sayin' it, you already know my name
But, if you don't then hi my name is Fredrick
I spit rhymes and entertain just like Cedric
And I ain't talkin' 'about no comedy show
I'm for real, y'all fake like monopoly dough
Man I'm tryna have that lottery dough
But these haters outta Gary, Indiana they don't want me to blow
I'm bringin' pain to the game and I'm only bein' honest
Givin' rapper the big hurt like Frank Thomas
I hit home runs, you don't hit that many
Only grand slam you ever had was at Denny's
I spit so sick I can make you hurl
I'm so handsome that I can come and take your girl
Give her somethin' that she used ta
Cause she love the way my cock stay up all night, just like a rooster
I'm a winner, one in a million like Aaliyah
I'm not thugged out but I'm jiggin' in a beah
Who dat? who dat is? it's ya boy Freddie Gibbs
Spittin' game like a pimp, I'm so cold on a bitch

Fish and bread keep the poor man fed
But that lobster and shrimp, that's the meal for a pimp
A sandwich ain't a sandwich without miracle whip
And the track ain't on fire 'til I spit my shit

Well gon' spit yo' shit
Nigga you spit yo' shit
Gon' spit yo' shit
Nigga get off my dick
Gon' spit yo' shit
Nigga you spit yo' shit
Gon' spit that shit
Nigga get off my dick

[Ivoe:]
Now fish and bread keep the poor man fed
But I'mma lace the muthafuckin' track with' some lyrical lead (woah) You better off smokin' on PCP (why?)
Cause I got the recipe ain't no contestin' with' me
You want the drama I'mma bring it to you COD
But when it's over with', said and done, I'm chargin' a fee
You ain't, when you spit you like a hoe with' VD
And your purpose is worthless to the whole hip hop industry
Think ya tight on the mic with that? I disagree
You got ya hair pumped up watchin' AJ and Free
Like I can do dat, but ya ain't ready for BET
I'm aggravated, get assassinated like Kennedy
Now what is it
Henny done got me ready to grip the semi
Maybe the Remy gon' tempt me out those slugs like a frisbee
Look what you done did, you see the MD
You shoulda took ya mama's advice and stayed out the street
But take it from me, ye ain't got enough skills to compete
Anotha thing, don't touch the boy I-V-O-E
I'm through dealin' with' wack cats, lames collapse from my tool
See I'm a big boy in this game, I got more food than a mule
Dude I'm blazin' the booth (what?) I'm hotter than fire
And I'mma keep goin' 'til the world expire
Freddie Gibbs and Ivoe, ridin' on rivals
We got cash with' lyrics and you grippin' the bible (Jesus)
Kickin' shit like karate and you weaker than Taebo
Lobster and shrimp what a pimp got and that's how it goes

[Freddie Gibbs:]
Fish and bread keep the poor man fed
But that lobster and shrimp, that's the meal for a pimp
A sandwich ain't a sandwich without miracle whip
And the track ain't on fire 'til I spit my shit

Well gon' spit yo' shit
Nigga you spit yo' shit
Gon' spit yo' shit
Nigga get off my dick
Gon' spit yo' shit
Nigga you spit yo' shit
Gon' spit that shit
Nigga get off my dick

[Outro:]
You have just witnessed, lyrical detonation
By Freddie Gibbs and Ivoe
That's how it goes in the murder capitol nigga
Tell 'em som' Gibbs
Get off some dick, sons of bitches
Bitches, you heard what the fuck he said
That's how it goes down
Over another production
Get off some dick man
Resolve the issue my nizzle
That's how we goin' in the mad Midwest
My fish and bread right here man, you know what I'm sayin'?
This my shit, this shit is real, real easy
Y'all muthafuckas make this shit difficult, you know what I'm sayin'?
[?] what the fuck it is? get yo' shit up dude
Get off some dick
Fish and bread keep the poor man fed
Fish and bread keep the poor man fed
Lobster and shrimp, that's the meal for pimps
Fish and bread muthafucka
Lobster and shrimp for a pimp

// Living 2 Die //

[Freddie Gibbs:]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
(You don't know)
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[The Notorious BIG:] Check it

[Freddie Gibbs:]
I'm a rebel, I don't give a fuck about rules
Fuck college, I don't give a fuck about school
But you ass if you assume that I'm not smart
Because I made bad grades in the classroom
When I'm hustlin' I got a A average
Student of the game, I know how to make cabbage
I'm a street soldier that get no rest
Stickin' niggas for the cream is my M-O-S
And I'm always hungry, ready to eat
I got a appetite for war so I cook the beef
Ever since I was a shorty, niggas actin' ludicrous
So I rolled out with' my twin Glock 40's
You know that I'm the illest through word of mouth
And I don't toot my own horn cause you know what I'm 'bout
Man I ain't gotta caddy truck or Chevy on dubs
I got a mean mug and a 38 snub
Don't try to be like Freddie, you ain't him
Don't compare me to other rappers, I ain't them
You might've seen me in a magazine lookin' crucial
I ain't pose with' a gun cause you know I'd shoot you dog
I come in ya face with' two guns up
And leave a muthafucka slumped in his Yukon truck
They say the good die young but the bad guys die by the same fate
Get bullet holes put in the same place, we Heavyweights
And nah, I ain't finished
Don't include me in yo' petty beef, I ain't in it
Cause if I'm in it then it's on, fuck writin' another song
I'mma show up at yo' home, put the toast to yo' dome
Cause niggas get clapped and shit get deeper than rap
So I suggest you don't go deeper than that
So before you diss Fred, use yo' head
You don't wanna end up dead over somethin' you said
I ain't sayin' I'mma kill you if you diss me on the mic
I'm sayin' I'mma kill you if you threaten my life
A couple rappers they be sayin' they gon' kill me on sight
It's fucked up cause I see them niggas every night
And they don't jump it off cause they bitch made
If I ain't got a gun then I'mma slit yo' throat with' a switchblade
Take me out, I wish a nigga would try
I'm in the streets dyin' to live and livin' to die
And that's for real

Ugh, I'm livin' to die, come get me if you want bitch
Yeah, I done ducked down plenty of times man
A lot of cats is on these records talkin' this trash
How you gon' murk this, kill this, hurt this
A lot of y'all niggas still doin' nothin' man
Before you gon' say you gon' kill another nigga on a track man be able to back that up man
Cause a lot of y'all can not back that up man
Y'all just makin' these silly little threats out here man
Don't bring them my way
Serious, I'mma bring it back man
Rest in peace to everybody fallen
All the fallen soldiers, 2Pac, Biggie, Big L, Big Pun, Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah, Aaliyah, everybody man
Rest in peace to my grandfather, my uncle Wayne
Mike Langford, Quade Shepard, my homies I lost
Comin' up man we all dyin' to live, livin' to die
We make it through though
