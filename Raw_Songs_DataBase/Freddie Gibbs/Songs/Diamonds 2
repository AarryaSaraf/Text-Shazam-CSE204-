Yeah, yeah...
Fuck it..
Kane

Million dollar lick like can't nobody tell me shit, aye
Diamonds in my necklace, VVS' got me lit, aye
I just dropped a brick so big they got it off the lift, aye

I can't lie, still love my baby mama
When she piss me off, I'm on some pimp shit, bumpin daily dollar
Throw away that Tony, got me limit, I can't fight the demons
Found it, ride right solo in my beamer, tryna fight the demons, ay
Got that blow from my Dominicano
Got my whole garage on Forgiato
Wood and leather in my Eldorado
I just let them VVS' flood in my cubano

Diamonds in my necklace, VVS' got me lit, aye
Million dollar lick, like can't nobody tell me shit, aye
I just dropped a brick so big, they got it off the lift, aye
Million dollar lick, like can't nobody tell me shit, aye

I can't lie, still get high on prescriptions
Sometimes I go weeks without no sleep, I'm in the 5th dimension
I just caught a body, Luca Brasi, he sleep with the fishes
Fucked up part, is when I go to sleep - I see this nigga image
Bentley coupe, I guess you niggas out the loop, aye
Your hoe was a layup, threw myself a alley-oop, aye
Served that Tony Tony, when a nigga had no loot, aye
Your hoe was a layup, threw myself a alley-oop, aye
Got that blow from my Dominicano
Got my whole garage on Forgiato
Wood and leather in my Eldorado
I just let em VVS' flood in my cubano

Diamonds in my necklace, VVS' got me lit, aye
Million dollar lick, like can't nobody tell me shit, aye
I just dropped a brick so big, they got it off the lift, aye
Million dollar lick, like can't nobody tell me shit, aye
