Buried secrets, mythic meanings
In tender oceans spilling crimson
A leaking thimble flowing fragile
Oozing tension into blue

Hear these howls hurling our present
I know what this costs us
Hear these howls embrace the gnashing
I know what this costs us
I know it's exhausting you

(Without you, I am hushed) A hush
(Without you, I am hushed) A hush
(Without you, I am hushed) Like cloaking garment
(Without you, I am hushed) Over shivers
(Without you, I am hushed) In this honeyed season
(Without you, I am hushed) Why are the boys bleeding?
(Without you, I am hushed) Have your tears touched
(Without you, I am hushed) Someone's eyes tonight?

Hear these howls hurling our present
I know what this costs us
Hear these howls embrace the gnashing
I know what this costs us
I know it's exhausting you

Now I see, now I see
Now I see, now I see
You're weeping with reason
Now I see, now I see
You're weeping with reason
Now I see, now I see
You're weeping with reason
