Shadows extend east
And Cortazar stares at women shuffling by who blot their lips from violent men
And say "god bless you"
I sulk with pause and
Loving mariachi soars against the red and yellow tents of strangers
Gifting geese the ends of bread
8, 12, 13 hours and the people keep fighting for sleep, for rest...

I'm reluctant to stay sad life
Beyond is a field a flowers
My love is a nervous child lapping from the glowing lagoon of their presence
My love is a bulging, blue-faced fool hung from the throat by sunflower stems
