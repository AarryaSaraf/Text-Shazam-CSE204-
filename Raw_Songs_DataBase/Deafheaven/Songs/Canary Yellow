Staring out onto the earthly pottery of existence
Climbing light vines to heaven
Clay ribbons descend
Swirl downward against metallic swell
Go sail charmer, altruist
Who immersed in thickets
Hugged in cloth
Evolves into charcoal
Is worshipped by the drifting macaw
The lady finch
They swoop and croon through the air
Dip their feathers in the death paste of ash water

I have wondered about the language of flowers
And you, elaborate mosaic, greeting me
Gentle, the swamp takes my ankles
On and on we choke on an everlasting
Handsome night
My lover's blood rushes right through me
Wild, fantastic
