Stranded naked on the sandbar
Echoed from the stars
Neon
Sea snake cemetery roaming under dusk

Doberman visions
You're undressing
Mute and bleary

Hillside castles baking down to sand
Hillside castles baking down to sand

Shamed red Chopin
Plays awful sounds from the dresser
Nurse's hands carving in slate
Hummingbird gestures

Sleeping in nectar
Teething on freedom
Sleeping in nectar
Teething on freedom

The hospital bed filled with your apathy
In a haze of heat, a father hums his tragic song
Before the cold sees its ceremony
Oh, in your icy eyes
The daybreak glance given

Travel now
Where they can't let you down
Where you can't fail them now
Travel now
Where they can't let you down
Where you can't fail them now

Travel now
Where they can't let you down
Where you can't fail them now
Travel now
Where they can't let you down
Where you can't fail them now
