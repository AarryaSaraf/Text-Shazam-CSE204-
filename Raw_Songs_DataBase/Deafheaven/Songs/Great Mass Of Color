Quiet as a cradle
I laid in a middle night drift, spinning
Hissed at the moon
Conjured up the flowers
To fix my impression of the gloom

I feel them all
Great mass of color
Flooded in my bed
I feel them all
The great mass of color
Flooded in my bed
Dissolving into red

Half awake holding my ghost in the morning
Sunlight coming down the bend
Maroon sky on the send
My great former terror
When trees gave doves the leaves
And I was grim drunk death
A stranger to myself

I feel them all
Great mass of color
Flooding in my bed
I feel them all
Great mass of color
Flooding in my bed
Dissolving into red

Can I accept I'm real?

Do I need this affection?
Do you?
Do you need this confusion?
Do you?
Living trapped inside this body
Soft, haunted, waiting, wanting
Measured change evades real healing
Taking love with little reason

Seeing you as I was: behind a locked door
Nervous and a fool
Seeing you as I was: desperate for men to guide you

You are the sea and nobody owns you
Owns you
You are the sea and nobody owns you
Owns you
Owns you, owns you, owns you, owns you
