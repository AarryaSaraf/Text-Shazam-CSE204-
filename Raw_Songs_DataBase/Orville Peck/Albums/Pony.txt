// Dead Of Night //

The sun goes down, another dreamless night
You're right by my side
You wake me up, you say it's time to ride
In the dead of night
Strange canyon road, strange look in your eyes
You shut them as we fly
As we fly

Stark, hollow town, Carson City lights
Baby, let's get high
Spend a Johnny's cash, hitch another ride
We laugh until we cry
You say, "Go fast," I say, "Hold on tight"
In the dead of night
Dead of night

See
See the boys as they walk on by
See
See the boys as they walk on by
(By)
As they walk on by
(By)
As they walk on by
(By)
As they walk on by
It's enough to make a young man—

Six summers down, another dreamless night
You're not by my side
Scratch on the moon like a familiar smile
Stained on my mind
Some other town, someone else's life
Dead in the night
In the night

See
See the boys as they walk on by
See
See the boys as they walk on by
See
See the boys as they walk on by
(By)
As they walk on by
(By)
As they walk on by
(By)
As they walk on by
It's enough to make a young man—

// Winds Change //

Had a lover but I lost my patience
Gonna get a song on a radio station
Got a fire but you just can't use it
I don't mean no lies, baby, please don't lose it

Lost my way on the other side
I know why, I don't know when
From the way that we said goodbye
I knew I'd never see you again

Left my mind in the Salt Lake City
Met a lot of men who would call me pretty
Pack of reds, watch the dames get colder
Don't it make you cry, how we're getting older?

Lost my way on the other side
I know why, I don't know when
From the way that we said goodbye
I knew I'd never see you again

Ride, ride the wind
Ride, ride the wind
Ride, ride
Ride, ride
Ride, ride the wind
Ride, ride the wind
Ride, ride the wind
Ride, ride the wind

// Turn To Hate //

It's got an awful bite
It's gonna rise again
Keeping track of everything we lose
Another whole demand

Tell me you can stay

Don't leave, don't cry
You're just another boy caught in the rye
Don't say goodbye
Head full of nothing and I'm wondering why

It's alright
Yeah it's alright
It's alright

I'm coming down
I got your life laid on my floor
Yeah I'm something of a liar now
'Cause I've seen it all before

Tell me you can't wait

Don't leave, don't cry
You're just another boy caught in the rye
Don't say goodbye
Head full of nothing and I'm wondering why

It's alright
Yeah it's alright
It's alright
Yeehaw

Tell me you can stay

Don't leave, don't cry
You're just another boy caught in the rye
Don't say goodbye
Head full of nothing and I'm wondering why

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
Yeah, it's alright

Walking out towards the gate
You'll all be stars, now just you wait
Done enough to take the bait
Don't let my sorrow turn to hate
Turn to hate
Turn to hate
Turn to hate
Turn to hate
Turn to hate

// Buffalo Run //

Hitch a ride on my makeup
I consider it another man's problem
Yeah, head on, ride
Strike gold on my eyelids
Got a sister who knows nothing but violence
Yeah, head on, ride

Hitch a ride on my violence
Bring fear, got a fever in silence
Yeah, head on, ride

I caught you staring at the sun
Looking out for number one
Yeah, head on, ride
I saw the tail on your lips
Another truth for my fists
Yeah, head on, ride

Strike time on my target
Pull the leather, tug the rosary on it
Yeah, head on, ride
Rawhide on your polish
Strike a match, need a lick and a promise
Yeah, head on, ride

I caught you staring at the sun
Looking out for number one
Yeah, head on, ride
I saw the tail on your lips
Another truth for my fists
Yeah, head on, ride

Saw the buffalo run
Run (Run, run, run)
Run (Run, run, run)
Run (Run, run, run)

// Queen Of The Rodeo //

Sneak heroine, just a man
Slow on the draw
Velvet gloves, you still a stunner
Don't be down, girl, this world is a bummer

Queen of the rodeo
You rode on in with nowhere else to go
You know the tune so the words don't matter
Beyond this town lies a life much sadder
Babe, I know
Another evening to show
Queen of the rodeo

Sweet Marilyn, satin gown
Hard to ignore
Stary-eyed, a little younger
The night is long, your days are numbered

Queen of the rodeo
You're ridden out with nowhere else to go
You know the tune so the words don't matter
Beyond this town lies a life much sadder
Babe, I know
Another evening to show

I see you around
Still around
Still around
Steal the crown

Sneak heroine, just a man
Slow on the draw
They play your song, is it another?
Don't be down, girl, this world is a bummer

Queen of the rodeo
You rode on in with nowhere else to go
You know the tune so the words don't matter
Beyond this town lies a life much sadder
Babe, I know
Another evening to show
Queen of the rodeo

// Kansas (Remembers Me Now) //

Come and lay down your shoulder
Tomorrow isn't that far
And if we don't get older
Just know you were always my star

They said, "Why, oh, why did you do it?"
But if I die (But if I die), don't you cry
Because Kansas remembers me now
(Kansas remembers, Kansas remembers)
Kansas remembers me now

Come, last leg of sunset
Nothing left to hide (Nothing left to hide)
Brother's gone, do I regret it?
Not a thing, now that Dick's by my side

They said, "Why, oh, why did you do it?"
But if I die, don't you cry
Because Kansas remembers me now
(Kansas remembers, Kansas remembers)
Kansas remembers me now

Kansas remembers me now

// Old River //

Old river, tumble down
Poor Moore sister broke her crown
Still, there's snow left on the ground
Old river tumblin' down
Old river, tumble down
Big wind blowin' all around
Each small bullet makes a sound
Old river tumblin' down

Tumblin' down, tumblin' down
Tumblin' down, tumblin' down
Tumblin' down, tumblin' down

// Big Sky //

Fell in love with a rider
Dirt king, black crown
Six months on a knucklehead hog
I like him best when he's not around
He gets me high, ooh, big sky

Fell in love with a boxer
Stayed awake all year
Heartbreak is a warm sensation
When the only feeling that you know is fear
I don't know why, oh, big sky

Big sky, big sky
I don't know why
Oh, big sky

Fell in love with a jailer
Cabin at Fort Quay
Her and me and the baby made three
Visit once in a while when I'm not at sea
She keeps me dry, oh, big sky

Big sky, big sky
I don't know why
Oh, big sky

Big sky, big sky
Big sky, big sky

// Roses Are Falling //

Back on the run, back to the blue
Winning is fun, losing is, too
Roses are fallin', roses from fallin' for you, ooh

The ache inside the hate
I found a way to sit and wait
And now I can't, your voice, your face
Without a trace, I'll wait for you
Roses are fallin' for you, you

Under your skin, over the moon
Don't let me in, I don't know what I'd do
Roses are fallin', roses from fallin' for you, ooh

You know darling, you bring out the worst in me
Sometimes, when I'm around you, I feel like pure evil
I guess they say nobody's perfect
But they've never met a devil like you

Oh, roses are fallin' for you
Roses are fallin' for you
Roses are fallin' for you

// Take You Back (The Iron Hoof Cattle Call) //

Hear them riding, baby
Hear them coming around my door (Oh no)
Light's been out, though, baby
And I've been long, long gone (Yeehaw)
I'm keen to play with fire, but now I'm not so sure

Racing down the road that I've been before
I've seen rattlesnakes behind every door
I've been around this world and now everything's a bore
I don't know that much, but I know about keeping score
And if there's one thing I know for sure
It'd be a long cold day in Hell when I take you back

Can you hear the horses, baby?
Stronger than an iron hoof
But this town has always bored me
And baby, that's including you

Racing down the road that I've been before
I've seen rattlesnakes behind every door
I've been around this world and it's rotten to the core
Yeah, I don't know that much, but I know about keeping score
I got a face of gold, I got a heart of coal
But baby, that's my cross to bear
I won't take you back

I won't take you back
I won't take you back
I won't take you back
I won't take you back
I won't take you back
I won't take you back

// Hope To Die //

Gone was the way we were
Just like the days we'd burn
Everything 'round us would burn

Take me back to the time
I was yours and you were mine
Take me back, the words I'd say
I had to whisper
Because you liked it that way

I'm still undone, not quite young
But I, I still try
Cross my heart, now I hope to die

Was the way we were
Just like you'd say, we'd turn?
Everything 'round us, big burn

Take me back to the time
I was yours and you were mine
Take me back to the world I know
You were crying
They don't cry when we're gone

I'm still undone, not quite young
But I, I still try
Cross my heart, now I hope to

And I'm still undone, I'm not quite young
But I, I still try
Cross my heart, now I hope to die
Cross my heart, now I hope to die

// Nothing Fades Like The Light //

Some men only ride alone
I only ride in the night
Some drown in the warmth of home
But nothing fades like the light

Blackened houses, morning skies on my mind
April showers, June is the same in your eyes
Something tells me, you know why I lie
But nothing fades like the light

Time goes by I wanna rise up
And I know why things change
And I know why I stay the same

Some say I should learn to cry
But I only learned how to fight
And I know everything must die
But nothing fades like the light
No, nothing fades like the light
