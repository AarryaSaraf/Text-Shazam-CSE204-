Never really felt this world
Haystack boy and dust-cake girl
But I, I know we never tried
Passing the days away
Dare me on a dime to say
That we had everything we need

Running out into the night
Starry boots and open eyes, yeah
You told me to shut my mouth and to my surprise
Neither one of us has died

Washed up, nowhere to go
Hate to say, "I told you so", but I
I'm just a nervous guy
Target on our backs each day
Tables turn, or so they say
But we, we know that nothing's free

Running out into the night
Getting low on luck, it's time to fight, yeah
You call me up and tell me all your frights
'Cause neither one of us has died

Running out into the night
Watch the girls, they're outta sight, yeah
I keep thinking we'll disappear but years go by
Still neither one of us has died
