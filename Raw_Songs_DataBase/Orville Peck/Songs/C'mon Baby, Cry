I can see the sadness in your eyes
You've been tryna hide what you left behind
They say it's darkest before the dawn
But you've been smiling for so long
A thousand teardrops can't be wrong, no

I don't want you to be afraid
Let me see you cry, oh I
I got an hour or so, take my hand and let it go
Call me up anytime, c'mon baby, cry

I can tell you're sad, boy, just like me
Baby, don't deny what your poor heart needs
Been so long since he called your name
On the run from a losing game
Just bat your eyes, baby, let me feel the pain

I don't want you to be afraid
Let me see you cry, oh I
I got an hour or so, take my hand and let it go
Call me up anytime, c'mon baby, cry

Three words everybody knows
Must be nice where lovers go
Take my hand, don't let it go, just cry

I don't want you to be afraid
Let me see you cry, oh I
I got an hour or so, take my hand, darlin' let it go
Call me up anytime, c'mon baby

I don't want you to be afraid
Let me see you cry, oh I
I got an hour or so, take my hand and let it go
You can call me up anytime, c'mon baby, cry
C'mon baby, cry
C'mon baby
