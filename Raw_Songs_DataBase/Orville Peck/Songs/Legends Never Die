Been gone, back from my old ways
Too long, draggin' these doggone days
But each song keeps me rolling along my way
And I pray

I've seen people tuggin' on the reins
Full speed, baby, dust is in my veins
A stampede couldn't break me in my stride
You wanna know why?

It gets lonesome on the lonesome trail, so keep your head up high

Because, baby, we've been up all night
I built that road and walked it every mile
Takin' orders never been my style, yeah, it's been a while
I've been rode hard and put up wet
Ain't nothing in this world that I can't get
Don't worry 'bout making sure they won't forget
No, it's fine 'cause legends never die

Wild heart, got some hazy memories
Bad start, yeah, when you keep bad company
Won't stop 'cause I never lost a fight
Well once or twice

I said, let's go, baby, I got nerves of steel
It's my show, gonna feel the way I feel
Another blow ain't gonna stop me
Wait and see

You got nothing if you ain't got pride so honey take the wheel

I said, baby, we've been up all night
I built that road and walked it every mile
Yeah, takin' orders never been my style, yeah, it's been a while
Well I been rode hard and put up wet
Ain't nothing in this world that I can't get
Yeah, don't you worry 'bout making sure they won't forget
No, it's fine 'cause legends never die

Baby, baby, you got one chance
Legends never die

Because, baby, we've been up all night
I built that road and walked every mile
Yeah, well takin' orders never been my style, yeah, it's been a while
Baby, baby, you get one chance, when you strike the match
Ain't nothing in this life gonna hold me back
Sometimes you gotta break away from the pack but it's fine
'Cause legends never die

Legends never die
They won't die, they won't die
Never die

Yeah
Legends never die
Baby, baby
You tell 'em
Baby, never die
