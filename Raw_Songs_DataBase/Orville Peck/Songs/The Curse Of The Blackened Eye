I've been hiding out, running from the curse of the blackened eye
Uh-huh
Darlin' I can feel it coming every time
I sat around last year, wished so many times that I would die
Uh-huh
Left it all and now I can see the night

It's true, true it follows me around
Nothing to lose, wouldn't miss it anyhow

It ain't the letting go, it's more about the things that you take with
Uh-huh
And I can feel it getting closer with every kiss
You gotta beat or join 'em, try to act surprised
Just flip a coin 'cause I'm too bored to lie

It's true, true it follows me around
Nothing to lose, wouldn't miss it anyhow

Always said I should work on my escape
Have a heart too long, it's bound to break
Acting out the opus of your last eternal ache
Boy, just sing the song for heaven's sake

It's true, true it follows me around
Nothing to lose, wouldn't miss it anyhow
It's true, true it follows me around
Nothing to lose, lost it all anyhow

Northeast sun
Northeast sun
Northeast sun
Yeah, northeast sun
