They say Paris is dead
Lived through London and drank through Memphis
The things you live by were once just a guess
And there ain't no glory in the west
No there ain't no glory in the west
Hard to think on your feet
Tired of begging them just to compete
Shoot to win can feel so bittersweet
But you take what you can get
'Cause there ain't no glory in the west
Blazin' on ahead, burning through it
Coming down the bend, nowhere left to go, goin's all we know
Ridin' past the best, and there's still no rest
And there's still no rest
There ain't no glory in the west

What's a boy to do?
Hit the road with a dollar or two
Haunted by what he knows he can't do
Gets it off his chest
'Cause there ain't no glory in the west
Burnin' on ahead, blazing through it
Running blind again, nowhere left to go, goin's all we know
Ridin' past the best, and there's still no rest
And there's still no rest
And there's still no rest
There ain't no glory in the west

Count your blessings they'll say
And after each midnight begins a new day
But don't place your bets on a word that they say
They'll put your life to rest
'Cause there ain't no glory in the west
No there ain't no glory in the west
There ain't no glory in the west
