Yeah, I used to find hope in the wreckage
Dark news in from the past
And all I can feel is the feeling that we'll never say hi if ever we pass
So, send word to my last known existence
Lost at last in the wind
It's all come-ups and clover until it's all over
You know all good things come to an end

And if you're thinking about dropping a line
Tell 'em I'm back on Southern time
To the city of gold and, baby, I'm told that Jozi is doing just fine

I'm too easy on giving out chances
Too long alone on the range
You might think that I'm strange but I come with a pain
Of a man scorned again and again
Some folks think about their lovers
Some folks think about their goals
I've been thinking lately about the way you'd speak to me
I think it's time I disappear, I'm feeling old

So if you're thinking about dropping a line
Tell 'em I'm back on Southern time
To the city of gold and, baby, I'm told that Jozi is doing just fine

So, just sit with me morning and nighttime
Have me on your front porch
I'll be still, I'll be quiet
I never knew why it was so hard for me to be who you want
Yeah, I've thought about finding new lovers
Thought about burning the past
All that I want is a kind heart to haunt
My shrink says it ain't too much to ask

So if you're thinking about dropping a line
Tell 'em I'm back on Southern time
To the city of gold and, baby, I'm told that Jozi is doing just fine
Back to the city of gold and, baby, I'm told that Jozi is doing just fine
City of gold, I've been told you're fine
City of gold, I've been told you're fine
City of gold, I've been told you're fine
City of gold, I've been told you're mine
