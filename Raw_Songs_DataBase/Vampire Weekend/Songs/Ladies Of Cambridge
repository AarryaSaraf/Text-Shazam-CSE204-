Chestnut vibes on a Saturday night
Mystical boys feelin' alright
Raggedy wisdom falls from my hands
The ladies of Cambridge know who I am

I've had dreams of Boston all of my life
Chinatown between the sound of the night
But if you leave I just don't think I could take it
Take it, take it, take it

Graveyard bricks will fall into style
Lady as Pharaoh, Charles as the Nile
That's a museum, price you could pay
Stones of your fathers stand there today

I've had dreams of Boston all of my life
Chinatown between the sound of the night
But if you leave I just don't think I could take it
Take it, take it, take it

I've had dreams of Boston all of my life
Chinatown between the sound of the night

'Cause when you left my room to go to the kitchen
I imagined that you were dead
A morbid streak runs through the whole of my family
But for you, I could put it to rest

But if you leave I just don't think I could take it
Take it, take it, take
