As a young girl, Louis Vuitton
With your mother on a sandy lawn
As a sophomore with reggaeton
And the linens you're sittin' on

Is your bed made, is your sweater on?
Do you want to fuck like you know I do?
Like you know I do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
But it feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel

Can you stay up to see the dawn?
In the colors of Benetton

Is your bed made, is your sweater on?
Do you want to, like you know I do?
Like you know I do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Is your bed made, is your sweater on?
Do you wanna, like you know I do?
Like you know I do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
