// The Veldt (8 Minute Edit) //

Happy life, with the machines 
Scattered around the room 
Look what they made, they made it for me 
Happy technology 

Outside, the lions run
Feeding on remains 
We'll never leave, look at us now 
So in love with the way we are 

Here
The world that the children made [x2]
Here 
The world that the children made 
Here 
The world that the children made 

Every night, they rock us to sleep 
Digital family 
Is it real, or is it a dream? 
Can you believe in machines? 

Outside, the beating sun 
Can you hear the screams? 
We'll never leave, look at us now 
So in love with the way we are 

Here
The world that the children made [x2]
Here 
The world that the children made 
Here 
The world that the children made

Here
The world that the children made 
[x2]

Happy life, with the machines 
Scattered around the room 
Look what they made, they made it for me 
Happy technology 

Outside, the lions run 
Feeding on remains 
We'll never leave, look at us now 
So in love with the way we are 

Here
The world that the children made [x2]
Here 
The world that the children made 
Here 
The world that the children made 

Here
The world that the children made 
Here 
The world that the children made (made...)

// Professional Griefers //

I like the sound of the broken pieces
I like the lights and the siren she says
We got machines but the kids got Jesus
We like to move like we both don't need this

God can't hear you,
They won't fight you
Watch them build a friend just like you
Morning sickness, XYZ
Teenage girls with ESP

Give me the sound to see
Another world outside that's full of all the broken things that I made
Just give me a life to bleed
Another world outside that's full of all the awful things that I made

We like to dance but the dead go faster
Turn up the slam/hound/bar/code/blast/her
We want the cash or the junk you're after
Rez-up control for the mix tape master

Cell-correction
Mass dissection
Death-squad brats are in detention
Morning sickness, XYZ
Boys with bombs in NM

Carbon-lacing
Spent shell-casings
Photographs that I'm erasing
Bonus lives with pixel-screams
Girls with guns on LSD

Cell-infection,
Mass-destruction
Program for the final function
Lab-rat king, rescue team
Save me from the next life

Give me the sound, to see
Another world outside that's full of all the broken things that I made
Just give me a life to bleed
Another world outside that's full of all the awful things that I made

'Cause we are the last disease
Another broken life that's full of all the awful things that I made
And we got the eyes to see
Another broken life that's full of all the awful things that are made.

// Sleepless //

In the end, we are nowhere
Sleepless and still and tight
Maybe we shouldn't fall asleep
Saving what was left behind
Standing outside the chalk outline
Beside ourselves in time
The only thing I want, is the last thing I need
Awake and sleepless as stars shine

In the end, we are nowhere
Sleepless and still and tight
Maybe we shouldn't fall asleep
Saving what was left behind
Standing outside the chalk outline
Beside ourselves in time
The only thing I want, is the last thing I need
Awake and sleepless as stars shine

// Failbait //

Burn like a furnace keep it hot like a thermos
It's the realest at your service, now I'm on a higher purpose
And You haters don't deserve us but we give it to you like a virus
We are the highest motherfuckers ruling from the hills of Cypress
magnificent you are insignificant see what is in my weed sack bitch
Try sniffing it sending I'm hitting it smells so aromatic smoking out the room
Sorry homie it's a fucking habit
Mad dog off the leash I don't be fronting son
Run up on me and watch a nigga give you some
I am swinging for the fence blasting up home runs
Go with a knife cut your ass like a shogun
A Little something for the peasant yanking on my chain
You the reason a niggas sing about a membrane
Running round like a clown acting hella strange
On the real the world forgot about your punk name

[Chorus]
We are the hill we came to get you high
They're calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high
Shitting on you bitches like a bird when he's flying by
We are the hill we came to get you high
They're are calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high

See my mind's at the pinnacle stress levels are minimal
You see a criminal labeled defined unwinable
You are so cynical smoke like is fucking legal
Either way the people represent if nothing equal
Yes spark it up date time mark it up
You got a problem I'm a rolling stone start it up
And if you start me up I promise you will never stop
Last thing you hear is the blast when the hammer drops
When you with a sick click, we uncheckable Cypress Hill misfits
Bring it through the vegetables
Bring in cloud smoke representable the highest man to toke and his general
The nation stands with us ready for war
We done talking two digits and we still want more
I could call you up by name but what the fuck for
You're under my sneaker that I stomp on the floor

[Chorus]
We are the hill we came to get you high
They're calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high
Shitting on you bitches like a bird when he's flying by
We are the hill we came to get you high
They're are calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high
Shitting on you bitches like a bird when he's flying by

[Chorus]
We are the hill we came to get you high
They're calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high
Shitting on you bitches like a bird when he's flying by
We are the hill we came to get you high
They're are calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high

See my mind's at the pinnacle stress levels are minimal
You see a criminal labeled defined unwinable
You are so cynical smoke like is fucking legal
Either way the people represent if nothing equal
Yes spark it up date time mark it up
You got a problem I'm a rolling stone start it up
An if you start me up I promise you will never stop
Last thing you hear is the blast when the hammer drops
When you with a sick click, we uncheckable Cypress Hill misfits
Bring it through the vegetables
Bring in cloud smoke representable the highest man to toke and his general
The nation stands with us, ready for war
We done talking two digits and we still want more
I could call you up by name but what the fuck for
You're under my sneaker that I stomp on the floor

[Chorus]
We are the hill we came to get you high
They're calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high
Shitting on you bitches like a bird when he's flying by
We are the hill we came to get you high
They're are calling me insane why you must wanna die
So high so high so high
Shitting on you bitches like a bird when he's flying by

// Telemiscommunications //

Hey babe, how's your day been?
No, you first..
Oh.. what? The delay's quite bad
Yeah, sorry..
Where are you, I can't really hear you
A taxi distracted..
Anyway you.. You were saying?
Wait, uh..
Now they're waving me over
Can I call you back?
Yeah, everything's fine
Why am I.. I don't know why
I probably just need sleep
It's been a busy week
Sorry, I've got to go
So, ok.. bye

This is just so unlike us
Cut back to horizontalisms
If we could win just one small touch
Contact versus tele-miscommunications

Plan foiled
The sirens pass by
Kids screaming
The longest public announcement
Reach check-in, finally got through
Running for a flight, shoes off
You're calling voicemail
In joke, group laughter
Closing scenes in a meeting
Angel (angel) why didn't you tell me?
One second, someone needs directions
Can't you see I'm on the phone?

This is just so unlike us
Cut back to horizontalisms
If we could win just one small touch
Contact versus tele-miscommunications

So unlike us (unlike us)
Cut back to horizontalisms
If we could win just one small touch
Contact versus tele-miscommunications

Did I tell you I loved you today?
Did I tell you I loved you today?
(kiss kiss)
Did I tell you I loved you today?
Did I tell you I loved you today?
Did I tell you I loved you today?
Did I tell you I loved you today?
(kiss kiss)
Did I tell you I loved you today?
Did I tell you I loved you today?
