Please stop me now
I ain't over you
Filter to block it out
You're powder blue
Pulling the darkness down
I needed something new
A feeling to talk around
Comfortable familiar you

You're powder blue
You're powder blue

Tell me I was wrong
Tell me what to do
Maybe I cut you out
Maybe I see this through
No one to stop me now
I'm over you
Finally figured out
You're powder blue

Please stop me now
I'm over you
Finally figured out
You're powder blue
No one to stop me now
I'm over you
Finally figured out
You're powder blue

You're powder blue
You're powder blue
