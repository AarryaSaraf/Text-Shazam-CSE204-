Inside my head, there's a little place left for you
What do you know?
What do you know?
And all I want is to find out what you're going through
What do I know?
Maybe this silence is dangerous

I wanted to hide
Now, I just wanna find you
And feel what's inside you
I wanna come over
And see what you've found
See if you're hurting
After tearing me down
It's the rain of denial

Inside my head, there's a little place left for you
What do you know?
What do you know?
And all I want is to find out what you're going through
What do I know?
Maybe this silence is dangerous

I wanted to hide
Now, I just wanna find you
And feel what's inside you
I wanna come over
And see what you've found
See if you're hurting
After tearing me down
It's the rain of denial

Inside my head, there's a little place left for you
What do you know?
What do you know?
And all I want is to find out what you're going through
What do I know?
Maybe this silence is dangerous

I wanted to hide
Now, I just wanna find you
And feel what's inside you
I wanna come over
And see what you've found
See if you're hurting
After tearing me down
It's the rain of denial

Inside my head, there's a little place left for you
What do you know?
What do you know?
And all I want is to find out what you're going through
What do I know?
Maybe this silence is dangerous

I wanted to hide
Now, I just wanna find you
And feel what's inside you
I wanna come over
And see what you've found
See if you're hurting
After tearing me down
It's the rain of denial
