It hits me, an avalanche
A flash freeze, never stood a chance
On my own to learn the cold
So far gone when you're in control
Say what you want, I
Say what you want, I

Say what you want, I

It hits me, an avalanche
A flash freeze, never stood a chance
So bury me, under your snow
Under your (Ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)

No light
Both arms surrounded by old white
Wrapped round, you going snow-blind
Addicted to getting your first bite (Ooh)
On my own to learn the cold
So far gone when you're in control
Say what you want, I

It hits me, an avalanche
A flash freeze, never stood a chance
So bury me, under your snow
Under your (Ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
Say what you want, I
Say what you want, I

Say what you want, I
