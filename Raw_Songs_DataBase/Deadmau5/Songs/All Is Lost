I still see you when I'm sleeping
Every single evening
Underwater and I'm screaming
And nobody can hear me

You say you wanna see me
Like every other weekend
So when you say that you are leaving
You better fucking mean it

Funny how it changes
Memories and places
Time that I had wasted
Nights where you was faded

Always see your face and
I can't even take it
Someone sent to save me
I don't think I'll make it

Funny how it changes
Memories and places
Time that I had wasted
Nights where you was faded

Always see your face and
I can't even take it
Someone sent to save me
I don't think I'll make it

I don't think I'll make it, I don't think I'll make it
I, I don't think I'll make it, I don't think I'll make it
I, I don't think I'll make it, I don't think I'll make it
I, I don't think I'll make it, I don't think I'll make it
