She caught your eye like one of those pointy hook latches
That used to dangle from screen doors and would fly up
Whenever you bang the door open again

She spoke with the wisdom that can only come from experience
Like a woman who went blind
Because she looked at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes
With pinhole in it and now goes around the country speaking at high schools about
The dangers of looking at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes
With a pinhole in it

Her vocabulary was "as bad as, like, whatever"
Her eyes were like two brown circles with two black dots in the center

We had never met
We were like two hummingbirds who had also never met

And I miss her already
