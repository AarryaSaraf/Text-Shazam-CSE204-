Is it better when I go
And leave you on your own?
Is it really what you want?
Is it somethin' that I said
That makes you turn your head
And leave me in the cold?

Do you hear me when I talk?
Or recognize me from my fault?
Never see me through your wall
Oh

Do you hear me when I talk?
Do you hear me? (When I talk)
Do you hear me when I talk?
'Cause I feel that you don't
Do you hear me when I talk?
'Cause I want to know, to know

Do you hear me when I talk?
Or recognize me from my fault?
Never see me through your wall
Oh
Do you hear me when I talk?
Or recognize me from my fault?
Never see me through your wall
Oh

Oh

Do you hear me when I talk?
Do you hear me? (When I talk)
Do you hear me?
'Cause I feel that you don't
Do you hear me when I talk?
'Cause I want to know, to know

Do you hear me when I talk?
Or recognize me from my fault?
Never see me through your wall
Oh
