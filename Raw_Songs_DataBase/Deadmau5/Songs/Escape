I'm not invisible to you
Do my eyes, do my eyes speak true?
My soul so in touch with yours tonight
Won't let my head, let my head take flight

We could leave this place
Freedom ours to chase
What if I escape with you?

What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?
What if I escape?

Is it real? Is it just a fantasy?
'Cause the unknown, the unknown's pulling me

We could leave this place
Freedom ours to chase
What if I escape with you?

What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?

What if I escape with you?
What if I escape with you?
