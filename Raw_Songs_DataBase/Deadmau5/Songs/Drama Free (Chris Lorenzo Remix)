Think of a monster, you name it, I been it
It's been a hell of a ride, but I'm in it
Birth of a queen is the death of a cynic
I'ma be good, but just give me a minute
Nowhere to go and I'm back at the wheel
No one but me gives a fuck how I feel
So I'm gonna drive 'til I find a good meal
Maybe then we'll talk for real

I'm on the road to heaven knows where
And I'm feeling okay, yeah, I'm feeling okay
I'm up for air got the wind in my hair
Nothing is bringing me down
Nothing is bringing me down no more
More, more, more, more, more, more
More, more, more, more, more, more, more

I'm on the road to heaven knows where
And I'm feeling okay, yeah, I'm feeling okay
I'm up for air got the wind in my hair
Nothing is bringing me down
Nothing is bringing me down no more

Bridge, you and I wanna know
People, let me tell you 'bout this

Off, okay
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down (Ok)
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down (No more)

Tie your hair back, keep the car running
Pack the Hanzo, don't stop for nothing
Go ahead and get what you need
Gotta keep it drama free
Don't forget you ain't owned by nobody
Shut the door when you count your money
Gotta keep it drama free
Gotta keep it drama free

I'm on the road to heaven knows where
And I'm feeling okay, yeah, I'm feeling okay
I'm up for air got the wind in my hair
Nothing is bringing me down
Nothing is bringing me down no more

Bridge, you and I wanna know
People, let me tell you 'bout this

No, no, no, no, no, no, no (Nothing is off, okay)
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down, down (Off, okay)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no (Nothing is off, okay)

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
