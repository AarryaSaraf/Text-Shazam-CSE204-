All the things you did without me
Is it fair to say we're done?
Chop and change between your feelings
Are we too far gone?

Love, you
Haven't been off my mind
Don't know how to move on
Saw the signs in your eyes
Didn't know what I'd done
Don't know what I should say
Baby, all that I do
Is eat, sleep, think of you
Baby, all that I do

Eat, sleep, think of you

All the things you did without me
Is it fair to say we're done?
Chop and change between your feelings
Are we too far gone?

Love, you
Haven't been off my mind
Don't know how to move on
Saw the signs in your eyes
But didn't know what I'd done
Don't know what I should say
Baby, all that I do
Is eat, sleep, think of you
Baby, all that I do

Eat, sleep, think of you
