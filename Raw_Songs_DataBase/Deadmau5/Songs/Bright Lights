Disco lights in the sky
Shining down, open your diamond eyes
Feel that glow, then you'll know
That you can come alive (Can come alive)
Shards of glass miles above
Rivers forming in the shape of us
Feel that glow, then you'll know
That you can come alive (Come alive)

There's a place we can go for a feeling
Where the bright lights take you over
Bright lights take you over
There's a place we can go for a feeling
Where the bright lights take you over
Bright lights take you over

Bright lights take you over
Bright lights take you over

There's a place we can go for a feeling
Where the bright lights take you over
Bright lights take you over
There's a place we can go for a feeling
Where the bright lights take you over
Bright lights take you over

There's a place we can go for a feeling
Where the bright lights take you over
Bright lights take you over
There's a place we can go for a feeling
Where the bright lights take you over
Bright lights take you over
