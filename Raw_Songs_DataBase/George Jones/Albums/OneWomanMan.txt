Album: OneWomanMan

// I'm A One Woman Man //

If you told me that you love me
I would feel so proud
If you'd let me hold you honey
I'd holler out loud
I'll never love another
Even if I can
Come to me baby I'm a one woman man

Won't you let me baby just a kind of hang around
I'll always love you honey and I'll never let you down
I'll never love another even if I can
Well come to me baby I'm a one woman man

I'd climb the highest mountain
If it reached a bigger sky
To prove that I love you
I'd jump off and fly
I'd even swim the ocean
From shore to shore
To prove that I love you
Just a little bit more

Won't you let me baby just a kind of hang around
I'll always love you honey and I'll never let you down
I'll never love another even if I can
Well come to me baby I'm a one woman man

If you told me that you love me
I would feel so proud
If you'd let me hold you honey
I'd holler out loud
I'll never love another
Even if I can
Come to me baby I'm a one woman man

Won't you let me baby just a kind of hang around
I'll always love honey and I'll never let you down
I'll never love another even if I can
Well come to me baby I'm a one woman man
Come to me baby I'm a one woman man...
