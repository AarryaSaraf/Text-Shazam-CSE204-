// The Good Ole Bible //

I believe the Father Adam 
Was the first created man
That Eve was made his wife
According to the Master's plan

They lost their home in Eden
The Lord they did offend
I believe the good ole Bible
From beginning to the end

I believe that master Able 

Was slain by master Cain
That Noah did go in the Ark
To get out of the rain
I believe that little David

Slew Goliath and his men
I believe the good ole Bible
From beginning to the end
I believe the Hebrew children

Walked in the burning fire
That Ananias was struck dead
Because he was a lair 
I believe that father Daniel

Walked in the Lions den
I believe the good ole Bible
From beginning to the end
I believe that the blessed Master

Turned the water into wine
As pure and sweet and harmless
As the grapes upon the vine

All other wines are mockers
The scriptures do contend
I believe the good ole Bible
From beginning to the end

// That's The Way I Feel //

If you ever feel unwanted
Kicked around so much you're taunted
Hearts cry's out with so much pain
Well, that's the way I feel.

Love someone and love her dearly
Hope these words she didn't hear me
Left me here heartsick and lonely
That's the way I feel.

A cry would do no good
I used to think it would
But the more I thought
The more I believe is what I'll do.

Let your feeling have it's day
Maybe it will go away
Maybe I will find another
That's the way I feel.

Can't let heartbreak over come me
Just because that's the way she done me.
I'll forget she ever loved her
That's the way I feel

If you ever get the notion
That you're drowning in an ocean
Of the tears that you are crying
That's the way I feel.

Crying just because your lonely
Crying cause your one and only
'Cause she loves somebody better
That's the way I feel.

A cry would do no good
I used to think it would
But the more I thought
The more I believe is what I'll do.

Let this feeling have it's day
Maybe it will go away
Maybe I will find another
That's the way I feel.

Can't let heartbreak over come me
Just because that's the way she done me.
I'll forget she ever loved her
That's the way I feel

// Don't Do This To Me //

I've tried hard in pleasin', you tell me youre leavin'
I must know the reason, don't do this to me
My loves like a flower that grows every hour
It's my only power, don't do this to me.

Don't squeeze it, don't leave it, why don't you believe it
It's made you, it's pleased you, but say don't you see
You're free to abuse it, yes, you can accuse it
But please don't excuse it, don't do this to me.

Don't treat me so wrongly for I love you only
Don't leave me so lonely, don't do this to me
Cause I love you honey, much more than all money
Don't think that it's funny, don't do this to me.

Don't squeeze it, don't leave it, why don't you believe it
It's made you, it's pleased you, but say don't you see
You're free to abuse it, yes, you can accuse it
But please don't excuse it, don't do this to me.

Don't breathe it, don't leave it, why don't you believe it
It's made you, it's pleased you, but say don't you see
You're free to abuse it, yes, you can accuse it
But please don't excuse it, don't do this to me

// You're Back Again //

You're back again but are you here to stay
Or have you come again to lead my heart astray
You know I love you though you treat me like this
You're back again and I know I'll get burnt.

Every time I hold and kiss you
You cause me to love you even more
My crazy heart just can't realize
You're back again just telling me lies.

Every time I hold and kiss you
You cause me to love you even more.
My crazy heart just can't realize
You're back again just telling me lies

// Eskimo Pie //

You can talk about your Frauleins and your pretty Geisha girls
And about the one you got in the USA
But I found myself a sweetheart in Alaska way up high
She's my Eskimo baby she's my Eskimo pie
She's my Eskimo baby she's my Eskimo pie
She lives south of the North pole and I know the reason why
She's my Eskimo baby and I'll love her till I die
She's my Eskimo baby she's my Eskimo pie
Crossing o'er the frozen river to a valley filled with snow
I lost all my directions and I knew not where to go
When a warm hand fell upon me and a voice said with a sigh
I would take you to my igloo Mister I won't let you die
Well she's my Eskimo baby...
And there came the day of parting and we had to say goodbye
As I crossed back o'er the river I could think I hear her cry
I know that someday I'll return I must before I die
Cause she's my Eskimo baby she's my Eskimo pie
Well she's my Eskimo baby...
