// I'm With The Wrong One //

I'm with the wrong one, yes, I know it
I'm with the wrong one and I can show it
Because I love you but I know you don't seem to care how much I cry
If you just knew how much I love you now
Just stop your lyin', stop me from cryin'
But you don't wanna show your love for me is gone
I'm with the wrong one.

I'm with the wrong one but you don't care
You don't know the pain I bear
I'm just another what can I do
I'm someone new to you it's true
I love you dearly and so sincerely
But you don't wanna be the only one for me
Although it hurts me so I have to let you go
I'm with the wrong one.

I'm with the wrong one but you don't care
You don't know the pain I bear
I'm just another what can I do
I'm someone new to you it's true
I love you dearly and so sincerely
But you don't wanna be the only one for me
Although it hurts me so I have to let you go
I'm with the wrong one.

I'm with the wrong one

// Give Away Girl //

Not long ago while dancin'
Our eyes by chance did meet
Though you were with your boyfriend
You swept me off my feet.

So foolishly as I cut in
To hope for new romance
I hardly had you in my arms
When someone sought your glance.

Your just a giveaway, giveaway, giveaway girl
You're careless with your charms
Just like a giveaway, giveaway, giveaway girl
You'll never get in anyone's arms.

You're everybody's sweetheart
You never stick to one
You'll play the field forever
As long as you have fun.

You'll take almost and bandit
You love variety
Whoever might be handy
You'll fall for stupidly.

Your just a giveaway, giveaway, giveaway girl
You're careless with your charms
Just like a giveaway, giveaway, giveaway girl
You'll never get in anyone's arms.

You give your kisses freely
You throw your heart away
You never stopped to think
That someday you will have to pay.

But by the time you wake up
You're best days will be gone
The sweetest words that you will hear
Will be, please leave me along.

Your just a giveaway, giveaway, giveaway girl
You're careless with your charms
Just like a giveaway, giveaway, giveaway girl
You'll never get in anyone's arms.

Your just a giveaway, giveaway, giveaway girl
You're careless with your charms
Just like a giveaway, giveaway, giveaway girl
You'll never get in anyone's arms.

You're just a giveaway, giveaway, giveaway, giveaway
Giveaway, giveaway, giveaway, giveaway

// No Use To Cry //

No use to cry don't even try to stop yourself from being lonely
I'm leaving you so you'll be blue a long long time
You thought you were smart to break a heart that love no one but you dear only
I'm gonna do your heart the same way you did mine
I'll board the train I won't explain just why the reason is I'm lately
Cause you'll know why but not to cry just wait and see
I gave you a home you done me wrong I tried so very hard to please you
Well it's goodbye no use to cry it's gotta be
You'll never win so think again before you do the same thing over
There's not a man that ever can believe your lies
Go right ahead and wish you was dead keep all your love deep undercover
Then when he's gone and you're alone no use to cry

// Nothing Can Stop Me //

I gotta get up I gotta get goin' rain or shine sleetin' or snowin'
Nothing can stop me stop me stop my loving you
Run through woods climb a high mountain
Love's in my heart like waters in a fountain
Nothing can stop me stop me stop my loving you

Cross the fire walk through river you'll be the taker and I'll be the giver
I'll give you lovin' lovin' honey that's what I'll do
Build a big wall I'd tear into pieces I gotta get to your love and kisses
Nothing can stop me stop me stop my loving you

I can't stop praisin' the day I found you
I'd walk a hundred miles just to be around you
Nothing can stop me stop me stop my loving you
Nothing at all, nothing in the world, can make me stop wantin' you for my girlfriend
Nothing can stop me stop me stop my loving you

Cross the fire walk through river you'll be the taker and I'll be the giver
I'll give you lovin' lovin' honey that's what I'll do
I can't stop praisin' the day I found you
I'd walk a hundred miles just to be around you
Nothing can stop me stop me stop my loving you

I'll walk through woods climb a high mountain
Love's in my heart like waters in a fountain
Nothing can stop me stop me stop my loving you
Build a big wall I'd tear into pieces I gotta get to your love and kisses
Nothing can stop me stop me stop my loving you
