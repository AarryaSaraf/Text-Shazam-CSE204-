// I've Got Five Dollars And It's Saturday Night //

(Hey)
Well, I've been a-working hard the whole week long
And I'm a-gonna have some wine, women and song
I gotta work next week but that's alright
I've got five dollars and it's Saturday night.

A music and dancin', flirtin' and fun
It's gonna go on until way past one
I'm a-gonna go where the lights are bright
I've got five dollars and it's Saturday night.

I'm gonna have fun tonight
Gonna get right tonight
Everything will be alright
'Cause tonight is Saturday night. (hey.)

Well, other folks worry what the future may bring
I'm gonna have fun and not worry about a thing
My pants are ragged but that's alright
I've got five dollars and it's Saturday night.

A-music and dancin', flirtin' and fun
It's gonna go on until way past one
I'm a gonna go where the lights are bright
I've got five dollars and it's Saturday night.

Gonna have fun tonight
Gonna get right tonight
Everything will be alright
Tonight is Saturday night. (hey.)

Let other folks worry what the future may bring
I'm gonna have fun and not worry about a thing
My pants are ragged but that's alright
I've got five dollars and it's Saturday night...

// I've Got A New Heartache //

You're back in town again spreadin' talk around
That I'm still in love with you though you let me down
I hate to admit it but I guess the talk is true
Or else you couldn't make my heart ache the way you do.

I've got a new heartache about an old sweetheart
That left me for somebody new
I've got a new heartache about an old sweetheart
And that's why I'm feeling so blue.

I've got a new heartache about an old sweetheart
That left me for somebody new
I've got a new heartache about an old sweetheart
And that's why I'm feeling so blue...
