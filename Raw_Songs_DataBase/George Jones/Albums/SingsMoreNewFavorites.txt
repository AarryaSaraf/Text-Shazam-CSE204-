// Magic Valley //

I'm going home to magic valley where hay turns into rose
I'm going home to magic valley leaving for my home above
Now don't you cry because I'm leaving for you see I've had my day
I've led the life that's not for grieving so rejoice with me and pray
For I hear my Lord telling me put down that heavy load
You'll reach your gold now follow me come on up the golden road
For I hear my Lord telling me...

// Lonesome Life //

(Have pity on me, please old lonesome, lonesome life)

Let's end it now, oh, lonesome life these heartaches
I'm tired inside and this old heart could use a rest
It might as well stop beatin' as far as she's concerned
And God, I know there's not a chance that she'll return

If you tell from me I can't go on in life
I'm dreaming from all memories of her tonight
I've changed my heart and left the world turn out the light
Have pity on me please, oh, won't you lonesome life?
(Have pity on my please, oh, won't you lonesome life?)

Oh, lonesome life, I've been through many things with you
Like sleepless nights and broken dreams and love we once knew
You know I served my purpose, so let's do what's right
And let me go from you, I plead oh, lonesome life

If you tell from me I can't go on in life
I'm dreaming from all memories of her tonight
I've changed my heart and left the world turn out the light
Have pity on me please, oh, won't you lonesome life
(Have pity on me please, oh, won't you lonesome life)

// Wrong Number //

My fingers tremble as I slowly touch the phone
I dial your number not knowing if your own
It rings you answer with sweet hello
My heart beats loudly as the teardrops start to flow.

I bite my lip until the blood runs free
And keep the words I love you hidden deep deep inside of me
I hang up wrong number I hear you tell your friend
But I just had to hear you talkin' once again.

And divisible was the word for you and me
But just one word in a just one moment will change happiness into misery
You hang up again and I know what you will say
Wrong number, that's the second time today.

Wrong number, that's the second time today
