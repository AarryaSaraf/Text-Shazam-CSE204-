// Silver Dew On The Bluegrass Tonight //

The moon was softly shing on an old Kentucky home
The fragrance of magnolia's filled the air
A lonely girl was writing to her sweet heart all alone
To say how much she wished that she were there.

Silver dew on the blue grass tonight
How it shines in the moons silver light
And the day that used to be, ow I wish that you could be
Silver dew on the blue grass tonight.

Star of love, high above shining bright
Know the wish that I'm wishing tonight
And you'll bring him back, I know, to the one who loves him so
Star of love high above shining bright.

Silver dew on the blue grass tonight
How it shines in the moons silver light
And the day that used to be, how I wish that you could be
Silver dew on the blue grass tonight...

// Wings Of A Dove //

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends his pure sweet love
A sign from above (a sign from above)
On the wings of a dove (wings of a dove)

When trouble surrounds us
When evil's come
The body grows weak (body grows weak)
And the spirit grows numb (spirit grows numb)

When these things beset us
He doesn't forget us
He sends down his love (sends down his love)
On the wings of a dove (wings of a dove)

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends his pure sweet love
A sign from above (a sign from above)
On the wings of a dove (wings of a dove)

When noah had drifted
In the flood many days
He searched for land (He searched for land)
In various ways (In various ways)

Troubles he had some
But wasn't forgotten
He sent down his love (sent down his love)
On the wings of a dove (wings of a dove)

On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends his pure sweet love
A sign from abouve (a sign from above)
On the wings of a dove (wings of a dove)

On the wings of a dove (wings of a dove)
On the wings of a dove (wings of a dove)...

// I Could Never Be Ashamed Of You //

Everybody says you let me down
That I should be ashamed to take you 'round
Makes no difference what you used to do
Darling, I could never be ashamed of you

Maybe you were reckless yesterday
But together, we can find a brighter way
In my heart, I know that you'll come through
Darling, I could never be ashamed of you

All the happiness I've ever known
Came the day you said you'd be my own
And it matters not what we go through
Darlin' I could never be ashamed of you

Maybe you've been cheated in the past
And perhaps those memories will always last
Even though you proved to be untrue
Darlin' I could never be ashamed of you...
