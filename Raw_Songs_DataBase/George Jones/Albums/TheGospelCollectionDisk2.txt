// Peace In The Valley //

Oh well, I'm tired and so weary
But I must go alone
Till the lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes,
Well the morning's so bright
And the lamp is alight
And the night, is as bright as the day, oh yes.

There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace, peace in the valley for me, someday.

Well, that old bear is goin' to be gentle
And the wolf will be tame
And that old lion is gonna lay down by the little lamb, (oh yes)
And the beasts from the wild
Ohh it's gonna be led by a child

I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, 
(Oh yes.)

There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace, in that old valley for me, someday
There will be peace, in that old valley for me...
