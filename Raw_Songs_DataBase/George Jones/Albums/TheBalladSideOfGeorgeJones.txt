// One Is A Lonely Number //

One is a lonely number
One can never have fun
When I met you
I thought I lost the blues
But now I find that I'm back in
That same old boat again.
One is an unhappy number
Why do you always make me wait
One and one makes two
That's why I need you
One is a lonely, lonely number.
One is a lonely number
One is always on it's own
When I met you
I thought I lost the blues
Now I find that I'm back in
That same old boat again.
One is an unhappy number
So why do you always make me wait
One and one makes two
That's why I need you
One is a lonely, lonely number...

// Wasted Words //

The wasted words about an old love affair
You don't love me, you don't care.

I tried so hard to forget the thing that used to be
Bit it's so easy to remember a few old memories
Just when I think I'm doing fine someone speaks your name
And I have to talk about though I know it's all in vain.

The wasted words about an old love affair
You don't love me, you don't care.

An old friend tries to tell me that I shouldn't feel so blue
But that old friend he just don't know the love I have for you
Forget the past and have some fun go out with someone new
But it's so hard to turn the pages when I know no one but you.

The wasted words about an old love affair
You don't love me, you don't care

// Someone Sweet To Love //

Mama knows her child is ailing
What is wrong there ain't no telling
She don't know what's run my fever up
She wants to take me to the clinic
I don't need to see no dentist
All I need is someone sweet to love

Don't you bring me Doctor Jake
I'm strong enough to swim a lake
All I need is what I'm dreaming of
She lives just some corner
Help me out or I'm a goner
I've gotta find me someone sweet to love

Yes I work hard to make my money
Like the beehives love their honey
Everything but one fits like a glove
So don't send me a nice long letter
Asking me if I feel better
All I need is someone sweet to love

Don't you bring me Doctor Jake
I'm strong enough to swim a lake
All I need is what I'm dreaming of
She lives just some corner
Help me out or I'm a goner
I've gotta find me someone sweet to love

// Tarnished Angel //

Your halo is the neon
Your heart a jukebox song
Your heaven is a honky tonk
You love to live so wrong.

I know your not a changin'
As a saint you've gained no fame
My angels kinda tarnished
But I love, just the same.

Tarnished angel 
From a backstreet bar
Tarnished angel
I want you just as you are.

Our worlds are strange and different
But love they says is blind
I'll try to live in your world
If you won't live in mine.

Tarnished angel 
From a backstreet bar
Tarnished angel 
I want you just as you are.

Our worlds are strangely different
But love they say is blind
I'll try to live in your world
If you won't live in mine...

// The Last Town I Painted //

I came home the other night I've been out on a town
I searched talk through the house she was not around
I finally found her note it red this is goodbye to you
And that's the last town I painted and I painted it blue
Now that I have lost her I don't want to live
I done all the takin' I didn't want to give
Time has come it's plain to see the devil must pay his dues
And that's the last town I painted and I painted it blue
I still go to the tavern that I went to before
I search for the fun I had it's not there anymore
If I could have her back again I know I would be true
Cause the last town I painted I painted it blue
Now blue is not my favorite color cause it makes me sad
Why I asked for all these blues when I'm usin' too much red
I've got a lotta troubles no one to tell it to
Cause the last town I painted I painted it blue

// Relief Is Just A Swallow Away //

Well I was standin' in the tavern a-feelin' blue
My foot on the rail, just a-thinkin' 'bout you
But I won't be blue all day
Because relief - is just a swallow away

Well I've been blue before and I will again
I'll drown all my worries or I'll teach 'em how to swim
And I won't be the one to pay
Because relief - is just a swallow away

Yes, you thought when you left I wouldn't have any fun
I'll admit I worried but I won't be long
We're apart because you wouldn't swallow your foolish pride
So you hurt me deep inside

But you're not the first to hurt me and you won't be the last
Can't tell the future, but I've learned from the past
As long as there'd a cabaret
I know relief - is just a swallow away

Well, I looked down the bar and what did I see
Your sad-lookin' face a-lookin' back at me
Wishin' you could turn time a few hours back
Get off of that one-way track

Well you want me to come over, but I'll tell you true
You're as close to me as I am to you
And that may still be too far away
Because relief - is just a swallow away

I said relief - just a swallow away...

// The First One //

You're the first one that I've ever loved this way
And the only one to ever hear me say
Take my heart and all that's in it
It will beat for you each minute
You're the first, and I'll stick by you come what may

There are those I know who like to run around
But believe me I would never let you down
I could never get the notion 
To put ideas like that in motion
You're my heart's life and the only girl in town

I don't have a little book that's full of names
I don't live my life to play such foolish games
You're my pride and my possession
While all other loves keep guessing
You're the first one, and that's why I'll never change

You're the first that's ever made me feel like this
Yes the first to ever thrill me with a kiss
When those pretty eyes are gleaming
Makes me wonder if I'm dreaming
You're the first one, and the last one I'll forget

// Into My Arms Again //

The music from the honky tonk
The lonely songs they play
Comin' through my window
'Cause I live not far away

There tempting me to come back
To the things we used to do
But the honky tonks and lonely songs
I left behind when I left you

The nightlife with it's party's
That's you're style of being gay
Although it meant I lost your love
I couldn't live that way

I hope some day you'll think
Enough of me and try to change
And come away from the honky tonk
Back into my arms again

The nightlife with it's party's
That's you're style of being gay
Although it meant I lost your love
I couldn't live that way

I hope some day you'll think
Enough of me and try to change
And come away from the honky tonk
Back into my arms again

Oh, won't you come away from the honky tonk
Back into my arms again?

// Mr. Fool //

I've got a feeling you'll soon be leaving
But I won't beg you not to go
Because I've always been
A fool to cry for you

I know this time it's really over
For there's no happiness in store
And I will never be the fool I was before
No one can ever call me Mr. Fool no more

My tears were scattered with all was shattered
Dreams that faded in the past
Vows were spoken and vows were broken
But the last one was the last

So I'll keep smiling although you're leaving
For time will heal a heart that's sore
And I will never be the fool I was before
No one can ever call me Mr. Fool no more

So I'll keep smiling although you're leaving
For time will heal a heart that's sore
And I will never be the fool I was before
No one can ever call me Mr. Fool no more

// I Always Wind Up A Loser //

I've gambled in the game of love
The cards and dice have fallen
I've had my share of sweet romance
I've had fights and lots of quarrels
Well I've rode in cars with movie stars
My bank account's a doozer
But when I gamble with my heart
I always wind up a loser

I always wind up lookin' back
And I says, boys, what happened
The strings of love has just run out
And you heart screams it's madness
My sex appeals lies in the pill
And that's where I'm the chosen
But when I gamble with my heart
I always wind up a loser

At the game where money's to blame
With cards around the table
I'll make a bet and get a met
I haven't always been able
I guess the cards are all marred
And the woman's eyes are bluer
But when I gamble with my heart
I always wind up a loser

I've rode in cars with movie stars
My bank account's a doozer
But when I gamble with my heart
I always wind up a loser
Lord, Lord...

// Glad To Let Her Go //

You took her from my side
The day you took her from me
And you though that it would hurt my pride
But there were things you failed to see.

You thought you stole away her love
But I want the world to know
It's the truth she turned her back on me
But I was glad to let her go.

Yes, you thought that you were foolin' me
And even though it wasn't right
Let me thank you for you set me free
From a lot of sleepless nights.

My love for her had died
Yes, it was over long ago
And it's true she walked away with you
But I was glad to let her go.

Yes, you knew that you were cheating me
And even though it wasn't right
Let me thank you for you set me free
From a lot of sleepless nights.

My love for her had died
Yes, it was over long ago
And it's true she walked away with you
But I was glad to let her go...

// The Likes Of You //

The last time we parted
I was broken hearted
While the teardrops started
It's mighty close

And I set an' pondered
Oh, the dreams by thunder
And then I finally wondered
Why should it be so

A lot of fish in the ocean
A lot of star in the blue
And I've got a notion
That I can live without you

I goin' to stop my cryin'
When you start goodbyin'
I gonna quit relyin'
On the likes of you

You can go your way now
You don't have to stay now
Yes, you can go and play now
It won't make me blue.

You'll never change, dear
You'll stay the same, dear
But your little game, dear
Is my wrong gone years

There's other fish in the ocean
A lot of star in the blue
And I've got a notion
A lot of pretty girls too

I goin' to quit my cryin'
When you start goodbyin'
I gonna quit relyin'
On the likes of you

I goin' to quit my cryin'
When you start your goodbyin'
I gonna quit relyin'
On the likes of you...
