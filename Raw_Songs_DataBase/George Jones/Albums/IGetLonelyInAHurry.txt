// I Get Lonely In A Hurry //

Well, I get lonely in a hurry if you left for a minute
I go crazy inside while you were gone
Yes, I get lonely in a hurry if you left for another
I don't think I could take it very long.

There would be so many little teardrops fall
I don't think that I could count them all
And I know a heart could never ache like mine
If I couldn't love you all the time

'Cause I get lonely in a hurry if you left for a minute
I go crazy inside while you were gone
Yes, I get lonely in a hurry if you left for another
I don't think I could take it very long.

If you ever took your love away from me I'd die
I don't think that I might live in memories
And for sure I know that I would lose my mind
If I couldn't love you all the time.

'Cause I get lonely in a hurry if you left for a minute
I go crazy inside while you were gone
Yes, I get lonely in a hurry if you left for another
I don't think I could take it very long.
I don't think I could take it very long...
