Everybody's lonesome for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me
So everybody's thinkin' of somebody else
But nobody's thinkin' 'bout me

When the time rolls around for me to lay down and die
I bet, I'll have to go and hire me someone to cry
Everybody's lonesome for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me

Everybody's longin' for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me
Everybody's dreamin' 'bout somebody else
But nobody dreams about me

All I need is a bride who wants a big hearted groom
I wouldn't care if she came ridin' in on a broom
Everybody's lonesome for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me

Everybody's pinin' for somebody else
But nobody's pinin' for me
Everybody's crazy 'bout somebody else
But nobody's crazy bout me

Oh, I shine up my shoes and then, I slick down my hair
Put on my Sunday suit but I ain't goin' nowhere
Everybody's lonesome for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me

Everybody's yearnin' for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me
Everybody's fallin' for somebody else
But nobody's fallin' for me

Now, I ain't had a kiss since I fell out of my crib
It looks to me like, I've been cheated out of my rib
Everybody's lonesome for somebody else
But nobody's lonesome for me
