Well, you got my heart a-feelin' used and junky
The road of love is gettin' mighty, mighty bumpy
Tell me pretty mama have I filled your heart with hate?

Well, with someone new you're affiliated
And it's makin' me feel like I'm outdated
If I don't love you grits ain't groceries
And that's on every poor man's plate

Well, let me know honey, tell me what's a-matter
Let me know what's on your mind
If I don't love you ain't a cow in Texas
They're raisin' 'em there all the time

Well, I don't want to sound like I'm demandin'
I just wanna get a little understanding
If I don't love you grits ain't groceries
And that's on every poor man's plate

Well, won't you tell me something, baby
Tell me what's a-matter
Let me know what's on your mind
If I don't love you ain't a cow in Texas
They're raisin' 'em there all the time

Well, I don't want to sound like I'm demandin'
I just wanna get a little understanding
If I don't love you grits ain't groceries
And that's on every poor man's plate
