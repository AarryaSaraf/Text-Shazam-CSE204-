The mayor gave me the keys to the city
the welcome wagons already appear
but again I'll be packing and leaving
for it's plain now that she once lived here
it may be that I'll never forget her
cause she's love and love lives everywhere
could it be that I'll always be saying
I've got to go for she once lived here
I see her face in the cool of the evening
I hear her voice in each breeze loud and clear 
oh there must be a town without memories
but not this one for she once lived here
I've got to go now for she once lived here
