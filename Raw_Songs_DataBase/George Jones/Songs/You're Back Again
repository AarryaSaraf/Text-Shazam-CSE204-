You're back again but are you here to stay
Or have you come again to lead my heart astray
You know I love you though you treat me like this
You're back again and I know I'll get burnt.

Every time I hold and kiss you
You cause me to love you even more
My crazy heart just can't realize
You're back again just telling me lies.

Every time I hold and kiss you
You cause me to love you even more.
My crazy heart just can't realize
You're back again just telling me lies
