My years have been many,
My loved ones are gone,
And I miss them more every day. 
I'm ready to move to that heavenly home 
And I yearn for the day I can say.

Take this ring from my finger,
These shoes from my feet
Take all of my worldly possessions away.  
Just leave me my bible,
A date I must keep, 
It's homecoming in heaven for me.

I'll kiss my ol' mother,
Shake hands with my dad,
I know they'll remember their boy.
We'll all be so happy
And I'll be so glad, 
As our cup runneth over with joy!

Take this ring from my finger,
These shoes from my feet
Take all of my worldly possessions away. 
Just leave me my bible,
A date I must keep, 
It's homecoming in heaven for me..
