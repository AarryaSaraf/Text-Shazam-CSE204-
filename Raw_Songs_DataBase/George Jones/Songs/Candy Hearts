Once upon a time when we were in our teens
We shared our future hopes and plans and many lovely dreams
Do you recall that happy day about my love that true
And I gave a box of candy hearts with these new words to you
One little heart said I love you, one said please be mine
One said kisses to you dear and one said your divine
One little heart said dear you're the sweetest one said love me true
So with that box of candy hearts I gave my love to you

Now the lonely night are passin' while I'm far away
I wonder if you'll feel the same when I return someday
I can't forget I love you yet and I always will
So I'm sending candy hearts to say exactly how I feel
One little heart said I love you, one said please be mine
One said kisses to you dear and one said your divine
One little heart said dear you're the sweetest one said love me true
So with that box of candy hearts I gave my love to you
Yes, with that box of candy hearts I gave my love to you...
