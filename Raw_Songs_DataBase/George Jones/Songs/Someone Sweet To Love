Mama knows her child is ailing
What is wrong there ain't no telling
She don't know what's run my fever up
She wants to take me to the clinic
I don't need to see no dentist
All I need is someone sweet to love

Don't you bring me Doctor Jake
I'm strong enough to swim a lake
All I need is what I'm dreaming of
She lives just some corner
Help me out or I'm a goner
I've gotta find me someone sweet to love

Yes I work hard to make my money
Like the beehives love their honey
Everything but one fits like a glove
So don't send me a nice long letter
Asking me if I feel better
All I need is someone sweet to love

Don't you bring me Doctor Jake
I'm strong enough to swim a lake
All I need is what I'm dreaming of
She lives just some corner
Help me out or I'm a goner
I've gotta find me someone sweet to love
