No use to cry don't even try to stop yourself from being lonely
I'm leaving you so you'll be blue a long long time
You thought you were smart to break a heart that love no one but you dear only
I'm gonna do your heart the same way you did mine
I'll board the train I won't explain just why the reason is I'm lately
Cause you'll know why but not to cry just wait and see
I gave you a home you done me wrong I tried so very hard to please you
Well it's goodbye no use to cry it's gotta be
You'll never win so think again before you do the same thing over
There's not a man that ever can believe your lies
Go right ahead and wish you was dead keep all your love deep undercover
Then when he's gone and you're alone no use to cry
