If you ever feel unwanted
Kicked around so much you're taunted
Hearts cry's out with so much pain
Well, that's the way I feel.

Love someone and love her dearly
Hope these words she didn't hear me
Left me here heartsick and lonely
That's the way I feel.

A cry would do no good
I used to think it would
But the more I thought
The more I believe is what I'll do.

Let your feeling have it's day
Maybe it will go away
Maybe I will find another
That's the way I feel.

Can't let heartbreak over come me
Just because that's the way she done me.
I'll forget she ever loved her
That's the way I feel

If you ever get the notion
That you're drowning in an ocean
Of the tears that you are crying
That's the way I feel.

Crying just because your lonely
Crying cause your one and only
'Cause she loves somebody better
That's the way I feel.

A cry would do no good
I used to think it would
But the more I thought
The more I believe is what I'll do.

Let this feeling have it's day
Maybe it will go away
Maybe I will find another
That's the way I feel.

Can't let heartbreak over come me
Just because that's the way she done me.
I'll forget she ever loved her
That's the way I feel
