I went to sleep last night lonely and blue
Tears were falling like the morning dew
But when I closed my eyes my loneliness was gone
Cause I dreamed my baby came home
And you were holding me kissing me like you used to do
My heart went crazy when you whispered I love you
Yes you were standing there sweet as you could be
Like you had never said goodbye to me
For just a little while my loneliness was gone
Cause I dreamed my baby came home
I went to sleep last night lonely and blue...
And you were holding me...
Yes you were standing there...
