I believe the Father Adam 
Was the first created man
That Eve was made his wife
According to the Master's plan

They lost their home in Eden
The Lord they did offend
I believe the good ole Bible
From beginning to the end

I believe that master Able 

Was slain by master Cain
That Noah did go in the Ark
To get out of the rain
I believe that little David

Slew Goliath and his men
I believe the good ole Bible
From beginning to the end
I believe the Hebrew children

Walked in the burning fire
That Ananias was struck dead
Because he was a lair 
I believe that father Daniel

Walked in the Lions den
I believe the good ole Bible
From beginning to the end
I believe that the blessed Master

Turned the water into wine
As pure and sweet and harmless
As the grapes upon the vine

All other wines are mockers
The scriptures do contend
I believe the good ole Bible
From beginning to the end
