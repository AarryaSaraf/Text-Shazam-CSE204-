George Jones & Melba Montgomery
It's okay that you are leaving, it's okay if you don't care
It's okay that you are happy long as I don't interfere
It's okay with me sweet baby, I've been fed up from the start
It so fine to find another sucker, it's okay to break his heart
If you leave, I won't grieve
Leave today, it's okay
That's what you want, honky tonk
It's okay , it's okay, it's okay

It's okay you found another, it's okay if he wants you
It's okay to leave tomorrow that just what I hope you do
It's okay if your a cheater, it's okay if cheaters win
Cause it's best to be a loser when your in the shape I'm in
If you leave, I won't grieve
Leave today, it's okay
That's what you want, honky tonk
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

If you leave, I won't grieve
Leave today, it's okay
That's what you want, honky tonk
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay...
