Any old time you want to come back home
Drop me a line I'm lonesome since you're gone
I had my chance I played the game unfair
But when you left me sweetheart
I never thought I'd really care
Now that you're gone I don't know what to do
Won't you please come back I'm still in love with you
You'll find me here like the day you left me alone
Any old time you want to come back home

You'll find me here like the day you left me alone
Any old time you want to come back home
