Well in North Carolina way back in the hills me and my old pappy and he had him a still
He brewed white lightnin till the sun went down
Then he'd fill up a jug and he'd pass it around
Mighty mighty pleasin my pappy's corn squeezin (whew white lightnin)
Well the G men T men revenoers too searchin for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin tryin' to book him but my pappy kept on cookin
(Whew white lightnin)

Well I asked my old pappy why he called his brew
White lightnin stead of mountain dew
I took a little sip and right away I knew
And my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue
Light has started flashin thunder started krashin (whew white lightnin)
Well the G men T men...

Well a city slicker came and he said I'm tough
I think I want to taste that powerful stuff
He took one slug and he drank it right down I heard him moanin' as he hit the ground
Mighty mighty pleasin you'r pappy's corn squeezin (whew white lightnin)
Well the G men T men.
