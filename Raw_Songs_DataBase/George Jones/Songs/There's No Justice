Oh, I told you if you walked out on me we were through
And you told me that it couldn't matter less to you
You turned me down for someone who wouldn't turn a hand for you
There no justice in this world anymore.

There no justice in this world anymore
Sometimes I ask myself what am I livin' for
If wrong can triumph over right
If we are licked before a fight
There no justice in this world anymore.

Oh, you turn me down because you knew I loved you so
And you tried to see exactly how far you could go
Well, I thought that you would change your mind
But there's no hope for now I find
There no justice in this world anymore.

There no justice in this world anymore
Sometimes I ask myself what am I livin' for
If wrong can triumph over right
If we are licked before the fight
There no justice in this world anymore
