I wanna be with you I can give you love that's true
Just believe the way I feel I love you and I always will
No one could take you place with me don't ever think of setting me free
Just believe the way I feel I love you and I always will
Please be my love
No one can thrill me like you do I've spent the lifetime loving you
Just believe the way I feel I love you and I always will
I think of you each day and night I just wanna hold you tight
Just believe the way I feel I love you and I always will
Please be my love
No one could take you place with me don't ever think of setting me free
Just believe the way I feel I love you and I always will
Please be my love please be my love
