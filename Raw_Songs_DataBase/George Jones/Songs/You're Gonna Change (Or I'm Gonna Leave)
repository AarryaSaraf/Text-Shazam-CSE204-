Well, you wore out a brand new trunk
Packin' and unpackin' your junk
Your daddy's mad he's done got peeved
You're gonna change or I'm a gonna leave.

You're gonna change your way of livin'
Change the things you do
Stop doin' all the things that you oughtn't to
Your daddy's mad he's done got peeved
You're gonna change or I'm a gonna leave.

Well, now this ain't right and that ain't wrong
You just keep a-naggin' all the day long
It's gotta stop I don't mean please
You're gonna change or I'm a gonna leave.

The way they keep a lover happy
Make her do what's right
It's love her every morning love her out at night
Your daddy's mad he's done got peeved
You're gonna change or I'm a gonna leave.

Well, now every time you get mad
You pack your rags and you go back to dad
You tell him lies he don't believe
You're gonna change or I'm a gonna leave.

You're gonna change your way of livin'
Change the things you do
Stop doin' all the things that you oughtn't to
Your daddy's mad he's done got peeved
You're gonna change or I'm a gonna leave...
