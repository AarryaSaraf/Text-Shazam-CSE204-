Suppose tonight would be our last night together
And the love we have known came to an end
Would we laugh and tell ourselves think nothing of it
Or would we cry together for what might have been
I know I'd die in just a little while without you
Another dawn I wouldn't want to see
If you're supposed tonight would be our last together
Oh what a long and lonely night it would be
I couldn't live long without your arms around me
Too soon the blues would come moving in on me
If you suppose tonight would be our last together
With you tonight would be the last night for me
I know I'd die in just a little while...
