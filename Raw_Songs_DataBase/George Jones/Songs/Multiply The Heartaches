Once I thought two happy hearts would someday be as one
But then a third heart came along and now our love is gone
I count the many times I said I love no one but you
But don't be fooled by counting dreams that never will come true
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches
Divide the tears by everytime a heart breaks
The answer only tells that it's too late
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches...
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches
