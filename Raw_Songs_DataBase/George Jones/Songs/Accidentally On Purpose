In the papers I saw you this morning
You were lovely, dressed in your wedding gown
And it said you would marry a stranger to me
That had drifted into our old home town

Accident'ly, you met him one ev'ning
And you say it was love at first sight
Accident'ly on purpose you're marryin'
Accident'ly on purpose, for spite

For you say that you saw me out painting the town
That I was just a fool with the heart of a clown
Accident'ly, you were mistaken that night
Accident'ly on purpose, for spite

Yes, you say that you saw me out painting the town
That I was just a fool with the heart of a clown
Accident'ly, you were mistaken that night
Accident'ly on purpose, for spite
