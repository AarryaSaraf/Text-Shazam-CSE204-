People steal, they cheat and lie
For wealth and what it will buy
But don't they know on the Judgement Day
That gold and silver will melt away

I'd rather be in a deep, dark grave
And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul

What good is gold and silver too
If your heart's not pure and true?
Sinner, hear me when I say
Fall down on your knees and pray

I'd rather be in a deep, dark grave
And know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this world in a house of gold
And deny my God and doom my soul
