Yearning to be with the one I can't agree with
Yearning to hear you call my name
Like a fool I left you and now I can't forget you
Please forgive me take me back again.

I'll never be the same without you, darling
You'll always be my everything
My love for you's still burning and my poor heart is yearning
While you wear another's name.

Yearning to hold you, to let my arms enfold you
Yearning to hear you call my name
Yearning to kiss you, oh darling, How I'll miss you
Oh, how I wish you felt the same.

I never knew how much you cared about me
I thought that you were fooling me

Now I'm yearning to kiss you, oh how I'll miss you
I wish that we could make our romance restart
