I know you tried your best to love me,
You smiled when your heart told you to weep;
You tried to pretend that you were happy,
Last night I heard you crying in your sleep.

You gave the best years of your life, Dear,
And each precious vow you tried to keep;
I love you so much I want you happy,
Last night I heard you crying in your sleep.

Your heart is yearning for an old love,
With new love it's useless to compete;
It hurts me to know you are unhappy,
'Cause, last night I heard you crying in your sleep.

You know that you are free to go, Dear,
And don't mind if I start to weep;
I know I can never make you happy,
'Cause last night I heard you crying in your sleep...
