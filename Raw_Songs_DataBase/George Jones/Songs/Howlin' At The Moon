I know there's never been a man in the awful shape I'm in
I can't even spell my name, my heads in such a spin
Today I tried to eat a steak with a big old tablespoon
You got me chasin' rabbits, walkin' on my hands
And a-howlin' at the moon.

Well look, I took one look at you 
And it almost drove me mad
And then I even went and lost what little sense I had
Now I can't tell the day from night, I'm crazy as a loon
You got me chasin' Rabbits, pullin' out my hair 
And a-howlin' at the moon.

Some friends of mine asked me to go out on a huntin' spree
'Cause there ain't a hound dog in this state 
That can hold a light to me
I eat three bones for dinner today, then I tried to tree a 'Coon
You got me chasin' Rabbits, scratchin' fleas 
And a-howlin' at the moon.

I rode my horse to town today and a gas pump we did pass
I pulled 'im up and I hollered whoa!, said fill 'em up with gas
The man picked up a monkey wrench and wham!, 
He changed my tune
You got me chasin' rabbits, spittin' out teeth 
And a-howlin' at the moon.

I never thought in this old world a fool could fall so hard
But honey, baby, when I fell the whole world 
Must have jarred
I think I'd quit my doggish ways 
If you'd take me for your groom
You got me chasin' rabbits, pickin' out rings 
And a-howlin' at the moon...
