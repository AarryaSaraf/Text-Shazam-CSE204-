Everybody is going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how she set set me free
Oh, lonesome me.

A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool that's blind and just can't see
Oh, lonesome me.

Well, I'll bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy free
A flirtin' with the boys with all of her charms
Yeah, but I still love her so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms.

Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find me somebody new.
I've thought of everything from A to Z
Oh, lonesome me.

Well, I'll bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy free

Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find me somebody new.
I've thought of everything from A to Z
Oh, lonesome me.

Oh, lonesome me.
Oh, lonesome me.
Oh, lonesome me...
