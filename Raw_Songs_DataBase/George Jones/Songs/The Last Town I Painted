I came home the other night I've been out on a town
I searched talk through the house she was not around
I finally found her note it red this is goodbye to you
And that's the last town I painted and I painted it blue
Now that I have lost her I don't want to live
I done all the takin' I didn't want to give
Time has come it's plain to see the devil must pay his dues
And that's the last town I painted and I painted it blue
I still go to the tavern that I went to before
I search for the fun I had it's not there anymore
If I could have her back again I know I would be true
Cause the last town I painted I painted it blue
Now blue is not my favorite color cause it makes me sad
Why I asked for all these blues when I'm usin' too much red
I've got a lotta troubles no one to tell it to
Cause the last town I painted I painted it blue
