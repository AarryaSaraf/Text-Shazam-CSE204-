When you said you were leaving tomorrow
That today was our last day
I said there would be no sorrow, 
That I'd laugh when you walked away.

But A little bitty tear let me down, 
Spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not to make a frown, 
Oh, but a little bitty tear let me down.

I said that I would laugh when you left me
Pull a funny as you went out the door
That I'd have me another one a-waiting
Yes, to wave goodbye as you go.

But a little bitty tear let me down, 
Spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, 
But a little bitty tear let me down.

Everything went like a planned it
And I really put on quite a show
In my heart I felt I could stand it
Till you walked with your grip through the door.

Then a little bitty tear let me down, 
Spoiled my act as a clown
I had it made up not make a frown, 
But a little bitty tear let me down.

A little bitty tear let me down.
A little bitty tear let me down.
A little bitty tear let me down...
