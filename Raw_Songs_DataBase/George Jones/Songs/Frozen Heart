Frozen heart that's standin' all alone
It's because your love is forever gone
Needin' you like a cold hand needs a glove
Take my heart and warm it with your love
I can't count the times I've hide my face
Tryin' just to be in your warm embrace
The winter of life has fallen at my door
If you said I don't love you any more

Frozen heart that's standin' all alone
It's because your love is forever gone
I'm needin' you like a cold hand needs a glove
Take my heart and won't you warm it with your love...
