(Have pity on me, please old lonesome, lonesome life)

Let's end it now, oh, lonesome life these heartaches
I'm tired inside and this old heart could use a rest
It might as well stop beatin' as far as she's concerned
And God, I know there's not a chance that she'll return

If you tell from me I can't go on in life
I'm dreaming from all memories of her tonight
I've changed my heart and left the world turn out the light
Have pity on me please, oh, won't you lonesome life?
(Have pity on my please, oh, won't you lonesome life?)

Oh, lonesome life, I've been through many things with you
Like sleepless nights and broken dreams and love we once knew
You know I served my purpose, so let's do what's right
And let me go from you, I plead oh, lonesome life

If you tell from me I can't go on in life
I'm dreaming from all memories of her tonight
I've changed my heart and left the world turn out the light
Have pity on me please, oh, won't you lonesome life
(Have pity on me please, oh, won't you lonesome life)
