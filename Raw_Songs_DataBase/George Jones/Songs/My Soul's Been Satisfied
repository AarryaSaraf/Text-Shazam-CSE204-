I'm satisfied, I'm satisfied
Said He would be my comfort
Said He would be my guide
Well, I looked at my hands, my hands looked new
I looked at my feet and they did too
Ever since that wonderful day
My soul's been satisfied

Satisfied, I'm satisfied
Said He would be my comfort
Said He would be my guide
Well, I looked at my hands, my hands looked new
I looked at my feet and they did too
Ever since that wonderful day
My soul's been satisfied

Well the Lord moves in mysterious ways
His wonders to perform
You know He plants His feet on ev'ry step
And then He rides on ev'ry storm
Well He fixed my feet for runnin', friends
Then my eyes were opened up wide
He fixed my tongue so I could say
"Praise God, I'm satisfied."

I'm satisfied, I'm satisfied
Said He would be my comfort
Said He would be my guide
Well, I looked at my hands, my hands looked new
I looked at my feet and they did too
Ever since that wonderful day
My soul's been satisfied

Well it was way down yonder in the valley, friends
I was wanderin' all alone
And it was there I met my Jesus, well
You know He claimed me for His own
And then He put His arms all around me there
And then He drew me up to His side
He placed my feet on solid ground
And now I'm satisfied

I'm satisfied, I'm satisfied
Said He would be my comfort
Said He would be my guide
Well, I looked at my hands, my hands looked new
I looked at my feet and they did too
Ever since that wonderful day
My soul's been satisfied

Oh yes I'm satisfied with Jesus, satisfied with Jesus, 
Satisfied with Jesus, satisfied with Jesus
Ever since that wonderful day
My soul's been satisfied
