I've been looking through the window of the past
And I've seen the reasons why our love can't last
You've been seeing him and this I won't allow
Don't you know that two's a marriage three's a crowd
You're still keeping little things he gave to you
There are pictures and some letters tied in blue
And that night I've heard you called his name aloud
It's not right for two's a marriage three's a crowd
If you love him you don't need my company
Either close the door to him or set me free
You're the reason I'm alone with my head bowed
Don't you know that two's a marriage three's a crowd
One is lonely two's a marriage three's a crowd
