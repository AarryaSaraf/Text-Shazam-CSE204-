Where's that gal with the red dress on,
Some folks call her Dinah
Stole my heart away from me
Way down in Louisiana

Take me back to Tulsa, 
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, 
I'm too young to marry.

Little bee sucks the blossom
The big bee gives the honey
Dark man picks the cotton
The white man gets the money.

Take me back to Tulsa, 
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, 
I'm too young to marry.

Walk 'n talk with Susie
Walk 'n talk with Susie
Walk 'n talk with Susie
Walk 'n talk with Susie.

We'll I've always got a great big smile
Never do look sour,
Travelin' all over this country
Playin' by the hour.

Take me back to Tulsa, 
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa, 
I'm too young to marry...
