Put the bottle on the table
Let it stay by till I'm not able
To see your face in everyplace that I go
I've been sitting here so long
Just remembering that you are gone
Well, one more drink of wine
Then if you're still on my mind
One drink, just one more and then another

I'll keep drinking it won't matter
I'll just remember that I once had her
I don't know why I sit and cry everyday
I've been trying to forget
But I haven't stopped as yet
Well, one more drink of wine
Then if you're still on my mind
One drink, just one more and then another

Put the bottle on the table
Let it stay by till I'm not able
To see your face in everyplace that I go
I've been sitting here so long
Just remembering that you are gone
Well, one more drink of wine
Then if you're still on my mind
One drink, just one more and then another
