Well, I just get in my slippers and I light up my pipe
Sit down in my easy chair and fill the thing up right
I hear somebody holler and I jump to my feet
Go take out the garbage or you're gonna hear from me
Slave lover, umm umm, slave lover
She'd tell me not to wait, don't you hesitate
Slave lover, that's what I am.

She sent me upstairs, downstair looking for her brother
Uptown, downtown looking for her mother
People think I'm buggy 'cause I'm lost like a lamb
Won't you tell me baby, who do you think I am
Slave lover, umm umm, slave lover.
She treats me so unfair, she says that I'm a square
Slave lover, that's what I am.

Well, I go turn out the light and then I jump in bed
I got to get up early 'cause that's what she said
I go to church on Sunday and I hurry home fast
I just get through the door and she says take out the trash
Slave lover, umm umm, slave lover
She tells me not to wait, don't you hesitate
Slave lover, that's what I am.

She sent me upstairs, downstair looking for her brother
Uptown, downtown looking for her mother
People think I'm buggy 'cause I'm lost like a lamb
Won't you tell me baby, who do you think I am
Slave lover, umm umm, slave lover
She treats me so unfair, she says that I'm a square
Slave lover, that's what I am.

Slave lover that's what I am
Slave lover that's what I am
Slave lover that's what I am
Slave lover that's what I am...
