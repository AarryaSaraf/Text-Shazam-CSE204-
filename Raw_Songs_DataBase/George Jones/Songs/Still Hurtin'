I'll tell you the reason I sit here a-greivin'
I want you to know one by one
I've been defeated by someone who cheated
My heart out of all of it's fun
Happy we could be if you had stayed with me
But you wouldn't see it my way
But I'm still a-hurtin' and I know for certain
I'll even with you day by day

There's no use denying, you know you were lying
You wouldn't admit it was true
But soon you'll be paying for things you've been saying
That made me defeated by you
Happy we could be if you had stayed with me
But you wouldn't see it my way
I'm still a-hurtin' and I know for certain
I'll even with you day by day...
