Heartbroken me, lonesome as can be
Heartbroken, sad and so blue
Lonesome for your charms and your lovin' arms
Heartbroken 'cause I'm losin' you.

Most every night I lie awake
Just cryin' 'cause we're through
I'd give the world if I could hear
That she's been cryin' too.

Heartbroken me, lonesome as can be
Heartbroken 'cause I'm losin' you.

Heartbroken me, lonesome as can be
Heartbroken, sad and so blue
Lonesome for your charms and your lovin' arms
Heartbroken 'cause I'm losin' you.

Most every night I lie awake
Just cryin' 'cause we're through
I'd give the world if I could hear
That she's been cryin' too.

Heartbroken me, lonesome as can be
Heartbroken 'cause I'm losin' you
