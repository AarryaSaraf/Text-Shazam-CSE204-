I gotta get up I gotta get goin' rain or shine sleetin' or snowin'
Nothing can stop me stop me stop my loving you
Run through woods climb a high mountain
Love's in my heart like waters in a fountain
Nothing can stop me stop me stop my loving you

Cross the fire walk through river you'll be the taker and I'll be the giver
I'll give you lovin' lovin' honey that's what I'll do
Build a big wall I'd tear into pieces I gotta get to your love and kisses
Nothing can stop me stop me stop my loving you

I can't stop praisin' the day I found you
I'd walk a hundred miles just to be around you
Nothing can stop me stop me stop my loving you
Nothing at all, nothing in the world, can make me stop wantin' you for my girlfriend
Nothing can stop me stop me stop my loving you

Cross the fire walk through river you'll be the taker and I'll be the giver
I'll give you lovin' lovin' honey that's what I'll do
I can't stop praisin' the day I found you
I'd walk a hundred miles just to be around you
Nothing can stop me stop me stop my loving you

I'll walk through woods climb a high mountain
Love's in my heart like waters in a fountain
Nothing can stop me stop me stop my loving you
Build a big wall I'd tear into pieces I gotta get to your love and kisses
Nothing can stop me stop me stop my loving you
