I've traveled to the ends of the rainbow
And I've looked for that old pot of gold
But I didn't realize until I looked into your eyes
That I had a greater wealth than ever told

Into each life there's many kinds of riches
There's diamonds, there's pearls and there's gold
But I'd be the richest man in this wonderful land
If I had you to have and to hold

A true love is the greatest of all riches
A true love will never grow cold
A real love is all that really matters
For it's worth more than diamonds, pearls and gold

Into each life there's many kinds of riches
There's diamonds, there's pearls and there's gold
But I'd be the richest man in this wonderful land
If I had you to have and to hold

I'd be the richest man in this wonderful land
If I had you to have and to hold...
