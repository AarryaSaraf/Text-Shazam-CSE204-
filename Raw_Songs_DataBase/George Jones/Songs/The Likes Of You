The last time we parted
I was broken hearted
While the teardrops started
It's mighty close

And I set an' pondered
Oh, the dreams by thunder
And then I finally wondered
Why should it be so

A lot of fish in the ocean
A lot of star in the blue
And I've got a notion
That I can live without you

I goin' to stop my cryin'
When you start goodbyin'
I gonna quit relyin'
On the likes of you

You can go your way now
You don't have to stay now
Yes, you can go and play now
It won't make me blue.

You'll never change, dear
You'll stay the same, dear
But your little game, dear
Is my wrong gone years

There's other fish in the ocean
A lot of star in the blue
And I've got a notion
A lot of pretty girls too

I goin' to quit my cryin'
When you start goodbyin'
I gonna quit relyin'
On the likes of you

I goin' to quit my cryin'
When you start your goodbyin'
I gonna quit relyin'
On the likes of you...
