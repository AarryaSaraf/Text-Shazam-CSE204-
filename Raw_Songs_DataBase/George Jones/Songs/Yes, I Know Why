Yes, I know why I want to cry, it's over you
But I'm painting the town feelin' blue
If you've ever loved one that's untrue
Then you'll know why I want to cry, it's over you.

Well, I've tried you all over again
And you just lied all over again
Guess I'm asking for heartaches of you
Yes, I know why I want to cry, it's over you.

Well, I've tried you all over again
And you just lied all over again
If you've ever love one that's untrue
Yes, I know why I want to cry, it's over you.

Yes, I know why I want to cry, it's over you...
