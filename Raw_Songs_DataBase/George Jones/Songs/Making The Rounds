I'm making the rounds with someone new
Now that you've gone away
But making the rounds
It's not the fun if it was with you

The glamor has gone from all the spots
That seem so bright and gay
But making the rounds
Is all that's left for me to do

I never go home till the last
Hideaway place has closed its door
There's too much at home
To remind me that we're through

I laugh and pretend
That I'm not wishing for a bygone day
When we were in love
And I was making the rounds with you

I never go home till the
Last hideaway place has closed its door
There's too much at home
To remind me that we're through

I laugh and pretend
That I'm not wishing for a bygone day
When we were in love
And I was making the rounds with you
