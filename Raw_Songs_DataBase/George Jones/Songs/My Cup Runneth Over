Dark days ago (dark days ago)
I walked all alone (walked all alone)
I thought for my sins I could never atone
But then I was loved when I heard a voice say
Look and I'll turn all your darkness to day
Then I knelt down to pray (knelt down to pray.)

Now my cup runneth over (cup runneth over)
Life is so sweet (life is so sweet)
All I could hope for to make it complete
Down lifes silvery pathway He's walkin' with me
My cup runneth over, no sorrow I'll see

My future looks bright (future looks bright)
My heart is at ease (heart is at ease)
And every night while down on my knees
I thank the good Lord who smiles from above
And the happiess wraps me around like a glove
For I have His love (I have his love.)

My cup runneth over (cup runneth over)
Life is so sweet (life is so sweet)
All I could hope for to make it complete
Down lifes silvery pathway He's walkin' with me
My cup runneth over, from sin I am free
My Jesus saved me (Jesus saved me)
