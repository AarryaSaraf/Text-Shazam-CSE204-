(Someone who's watching over you tonight)
If you do your best to do what's right
And you don't have trouble sleeping at night
And the devil don't fill your soul with cry
And there's someone who's watching over you tonight
If you lend the hand to every man
And you treat him like he's your friend
And your conscience tells you you've done what's right
Then there's someone who's watching over you tonight
Yes friends you know he'll watch over you
As you rest your very weary head
And the angels will always be standing there
Yes right there when you'll be dead
So if you do your best to do what's right
And you don't have trouble sleeping at night
And the devil don't fill your soul with cry
And there's someone who's watching someone who's watching
Someone who's watching over you tonight
