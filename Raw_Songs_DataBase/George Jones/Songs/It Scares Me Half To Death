It scares me half to death to think I almost lost you
It breaks my heart to know how much I made you cry
And if you'll let me show you darling I'll right the wrongs I've done
And ease the heartaches I have caused in the days gone by
You told me that our love was cold and then you said goodbye
But I can't love another I'd be living a lie
It scares me half to death to think I had forgotten
The vows we made to stay together come what may
And while I'm holding you my darling I'm holding my breath
Cause just the thought of losing you scares me half to death
It scares me half to death to think I had forgotten...
