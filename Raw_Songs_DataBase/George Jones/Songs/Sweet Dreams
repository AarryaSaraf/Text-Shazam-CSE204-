Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why cant I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you.

You don't love me its plain
I should know you'll never wear my ring
I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you.

Sweet dreams of you
Things I know can't come true 
Why cant I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you...
