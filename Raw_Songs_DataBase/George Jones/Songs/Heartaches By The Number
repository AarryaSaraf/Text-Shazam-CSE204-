Heartache number one was when you left me
I never knew that I could hurt this way
Heartache number two was when you come back again
You came back and never meant to stay

Now I've got heartaches by the numbers
Troubles by the score
Everyday you love me less
Each day I love you more

Now I've got heartaches by the numbers
A love that I can't win
But the day that I stop countin'
That's the day my world will end

Heartache number three was when you called me
And told me you were coming home to stay
With hoping heart I waited for your knock on the door
I waited but you must have lost your way

Now I've got heartaches by the numbers
Troubles by the score
Everyday you love me less
Each day I love you more

Now I've got heartaches by the numbers
A love that I can't win
But the day that I stop countin'
That's the day my world will end

Oh, the day that I stop counting
That's the day my world will end

One line in reservation, is this
