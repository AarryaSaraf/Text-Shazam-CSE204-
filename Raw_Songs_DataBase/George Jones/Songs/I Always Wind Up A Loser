I've gambled in the game of love
The cards and dice have fallen
I've had my share of sweet romance
I've had fights and lots of quarrels
Well I've rode in cars with movie stars
My bank account's a doozer
But when I gamble with my heart
I always wind up a loser

I always wind up lookin' back
And I says, boys, what happened
The strings of love has just run out
And you heart screams it's madness
My sex appeals lies in the pill
And that's where I'm the chosen
But when I gamble with my heart
I always wind up a loser

At the game where money's to blame
With cards around the table
I'll make a bet and get a met
I haven't always been able
I guess the cards are all marred
And the woman's eyes are bluer
But when I gamble with my heart
I always wind up a loser

I've rode in cars with movie stars
My bank account's a doozer
But when I gamble with my heart
I always wind up a loser
Lord, Lord...
