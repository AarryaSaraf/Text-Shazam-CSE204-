Well, you and your true love have parted
And you left her all alone
Don't tell the kids until it's to late
Just say that the fault was your own.

Run boy as fast as you can
Back to the one who loves only you
Tell her you're sorry that you had to part
And don't break her heart in two.

She needs your love now more than ever
For she's all alone and blue
Don't fill her life with sorry and strife
Go Back and start over anew.

Run boy as fast as you can
Back to the one who loves only you
Tell her you're sorry you had to part
And don't break her heart in two.

Go back in that church, she'll forgive you
For doubting her love was true
Don't be ashamed to say your to blame
Her arms are still yearning for you.

Run boy as fast as you can
Back to the one who loves only you
Tell her you're sorry you had to part
And don't break her heart in two
