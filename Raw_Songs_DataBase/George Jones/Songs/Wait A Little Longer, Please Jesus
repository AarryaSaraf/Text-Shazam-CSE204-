Wait a little longer, please Jesus
There are so many still wandering out in sin
Just a little longer, please Jesus
A few more days to get our loved ones in

Here the labor is so hard and the workers are so tired
And their weary hearts are yearning for a rest
And they find they're getting anxious to be in that happy land
Where they'll receive such peace and happiness

Wait a little longer, please Jesus
There are so many still wandering out in sin
Just a little longer, please Jesus
A few more days to get our loved ones in

We look into the skies and tears will fill our eyes
And our weary hearts grow heavier with each day
We cry, oh Lord, please come
Come and take your children home
But then we look around us and we say
