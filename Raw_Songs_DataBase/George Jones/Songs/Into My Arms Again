The music from the honky tonk
The lonely songs they play
Comin' through my window
'Cause I live not far away

There tempting me to come back
To the things we used to do
But the honky tonks and lonely songs
I left behind when I left you

The nightlife with it's party's
That's you're style of being gay
Although it meant I lost your love
I couldn't live that way

I hope some day you'll think
Enough of me and try to change
And come away from the honky tonk
Back into my arms again

The nightlife with it's party's
That's you're style of being gay
Although it meant I lost your love
I couldn't live that way

I hope some day you'll think
Enough of me and try to change
And come away from the honky tonk
Back into my arms again

Oh, won't you come away from the honky tonk
Back into my arms again?
