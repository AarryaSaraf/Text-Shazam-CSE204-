I've got a sad, sad story friends, that I I don't like to tell
I had a home and family, when they locked me in this cell
I've been in here eighteen years that's a long time I know
But time don't mean a thing to me 'cause I've got life to go.

I went one night where the lights were bright to see what I could see
I met up with an old friend there, who's thought the world of me
He brought me drinks and he took me to every honky tonk in town
But words were said and now he's dead, I just had to bring him down.

It has been a long time now since I've heard from my wife
I guess I'd be there with her yet if I hadn't used the knife
I'll bet that little girl of mine don't realize or know
Her daddy's been here eighteen years and still got life to go.

I'll bet there's not one man outside that's spent this long in jail
I'll be here in this prison till my body's just a shell
I can't be free to go and see the ones that I love so
Yes, I've been in here eighteen years I've still got life to go.

Yes, I've still got life to go.
Yes, I've still got life to go...
