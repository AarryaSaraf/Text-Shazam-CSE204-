I keep a close watch on this heart of mine I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the ties that bind because you're mine I walk the line

I find it very very easy to be true I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes I'll admit that I'm a fool for you because you're mine I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side you give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide because you're mine I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right because you're mine I walk the line
