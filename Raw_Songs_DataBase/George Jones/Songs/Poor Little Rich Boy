(Poor little rich boy, poor little rich boy)
Poor little rich boy ain't got nothin' but lots and lots of money
Poor little rich boy don't take nothin' but some sad poor boys honey
Got to run all day with his fancy clothes and a big long limosine
Poor little rich boy ain't got nothin' but everything
(Poor little rich boy, poor little rich boy)
Now theres an old saying I used to hear keeps a-running through my mind
How a baby boy born with a silver spoon was in for a mighty bad time
Pity the rich kid I've always heard, I can't for the life of me
While he's a-wading in a pool of riches I'm sinking in poverty
(Poor little rich boy, poor little rich boy)
Poor little rich boy ain't got nothin' but lots and lots of money
Poor little rich boy don't take nothin' but some sad poor boys honey
Got to run all day with his fancy clothes and a big long limosine
Poor little rich boy ain't got nothin' but everything
(Poor little rich boy, poor little rich boy)
I work and sweat and played all day but what good did it do
 that I wasn't thinking of you
Cause a poor boys chances are mighty slim cause when I got into town
I walked by your house and saw your porch light burnin' and I knew who'd been around
(Poor little rich boy, poor little rich boy.)
Poor little rich boy ain't got nothin' but lots and lots of money
Poor little rich boy don't take nothin' but some sad poor boys honey
Got to run all day with his fancy clothes and a big long limosine
Poor little rich boy ain't got nothin' but everything
(Poor little rich boy, poor little rich boy.)
(Poor little rich boy, poor little rich boy.)
(Poor little rich boy, poor little rich boy...)
