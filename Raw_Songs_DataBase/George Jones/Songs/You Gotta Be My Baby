Oh, you said you wes my baby 
Now I know that you're my baby
But it seems to me you got rovin' eye
If you wanna be my baby 
Then you gotta be my baby
You can't keep your finger in two different fire.

I remember how you pleaded 
When you told me that you needed
My lovin' I believe it without a doubt
So if you wanna be my baby 
Then you gotta be my baby
And you gotta leave 'em kissin' cousins out.

Oh, when you're high steppin' I'm a crawlin' low
I get suspicious and I'm a gonna tell you so
If you wanna be my baby 
Then you gotta be my baby
And be nobody's baby but mine.

Now I heard there was another 
So I went and asked your mother
If anybody hung around 'sides me
She gave me no satisfaction 
So now I can't take no action
But I think that I'll just hang around and see.

If you wanna be my baby 
Then you gotta be my baby
And you gotta come to me and tell me so
If you're gonna be my baby 
Then you gotta be my baby
I'm tired of waitin' round so let me know.

Oh, when you're high steppin' I'm a crawlin' low
I get suspicious and I'm a gonna tell you so
If you wanna be my baby 
Then you gotta be my baby
And be nobody's baby but mine.

You've gotta be nobody's baby but mine...
