Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and proved untrue
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
It was on the moonlight night the stars were shining bright
It whispered from on high your love has said goodbye
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and said goodbye
I said the blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining...
Well it was on the moonlight night...
Well it was on the moonlight night...
