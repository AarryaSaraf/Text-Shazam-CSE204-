Lost his love and started drinkin'
Trying Hard to stop from thinkin'
He found out it was not the thing to do
There no reason to be sobbin'
It won't stop your heart from throbbin'
Stop and think just why he left you there so blue.

If you see you were mistaken
Never a'gain you'll be forsaken
Can't you see he wants to do the thing that right
Let him know if your still greivin'
If you are he'll soon be leavin'
Let him know then he'll be right there tonight.

If you think he's gone forever
That's no reason while he'll never
Change his mind when your memeory starts to burn
Why don't you try to be stronger
Be with the one you love a little longer
Give him plenty of time to think it's now his turn.

If you see you were mistaken
Never again you'll be forsaken
Can't you see he wants to do the thing that right
There no reason to be sobbin'
It won't stop your heart from throbbin'
Let him know then he'll be right there tonight...
