I know I was a fool to let you go
I know it's true because my heart tells me it's so
My only chance at happiness is someday when
I'll win you back but I'll be blue until then
You mean the world to me my life my destiny
Your true love means everything to me
I try to lose the thought of loving you again
But memories are just a story with an end
For you the flame of love will burn till someday when
I'll win you back but I'll be blue until then
I try to lose the thought of loving you again...
