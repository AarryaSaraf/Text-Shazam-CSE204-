Have you ever come home tired and all worn out
Life is gay and you're wonderin' what it's about
Still you find out what is it mothers comin' for a visit
Have you ever, I have, haven't you now tell me?

Have you ever asked you hubby for some dough
With a dirty look he'll tell you where to go
Oh, you thought you had a thinker, but it turns out he's a stinker
Have you ever, I have, haven't you now tell me?

We're not sorry we got married
Even though sometimes we fuss and fight
We're so happy we're together
Hope you know that everything will turn out right.

Have you ever called your wife and made a date
Just to have your honey show up three hours late
While across the floor you pace she's a-fixing up her face
Have you ever, I have, haven't you now tell me?

Have you ever spent the day a-scrubbin' floors. oh me
You've washed and ironed and done up all the chores
Well, your so tired your life is ruined then hubby asked what you've been doin'
Have you ever, I have, haven't you now tell me?

Have you ever set and worried about your debt
You wonder how you'll ever get 'em met
Then wife says she needs some cloths she's just got to have some dough
Have you ever, I have, haven't you now tell me?

We're not sorry we got married
Even though sometimes we fuss and fight
We're so happy we're together
Hope you know that everything will turn out right.

Have you ever called up your honey for a date
Just to have your honey show up three hours late
While across the floor you pace she's fixing up her face
Have you ever, I have, haven't you now tell me?

Have you ever, I have, haven't you now tell me?...
