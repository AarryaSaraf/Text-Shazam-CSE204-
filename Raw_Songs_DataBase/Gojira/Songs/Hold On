I've been grinding and grinding
O! Ocean have mercy

I've been grinding and grinding
O! Ocean have mercy
I give you my life
O! Son of the Sun

I've been rowing and rowing
No sign of land so far in the flood
I've been through fire and wind I'm hanging, feet in the depth

Drowning all day long, in an ocean of stress
Gotta find a safety raAAAAAAft, another wave is striking down

Hold on! Fight!
We are are merely grabbing on to...
Hold on! Fight!
Unconscious ride around the core

In a matter of time, you're out in the open
You shall prove yourself in the bitter end
But for now, brace yourself!

Hold on! Fight!
We are merely grabbing on to...
Hold on! Fight!
Unconscious ride around the core

When you witness death you understand your demise
And you may embrace your destiny the fate of all
And maybe when we die we rise, high, find a ground
And we return where we belong

Elders, deep under
Shelter, land!

Fight!
We are merely grabbing on to life
Fight!
One last attempt to break the code...

Hold on! Fight!
We are are merely grabbing on to...
Hold on! Fight!
Unconscious ride around the core

Hold on! Fight!
Hold on tight!
Hold on! Fight!
Hold on tight!
