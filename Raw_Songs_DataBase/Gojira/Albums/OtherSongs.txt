// Inferno //

I am the womb and the grave
You must bow to the stone you were made of
For you have offended your God
Your end is the only cure

Enough with the fume
May the winds wash it all
My tears made a flood
And it's rising at your door

I provided you with the gold
And you smashed it all to the ground
I can hear the screams while you drown
Under this bed of rock you belong

Rot in your filth
Underground you shall dwell
Who needs a life when this life is a plague?
Welcome the mighty blow
Behold the miracle cleanse

A king will return
And that king is a stone

// Of Blood And Salt //

I take what life's been given
With my bloody hands
Discovery of the world
As my head decides
Swallow the lies
From sick ideals

So my head is on fire
Can't stand the pressure
I've got to run away
My head is exploding
Come back to the reason
I fade away
All hail the new blood
Flowing from lies again

Let's go

Swallowing the dust from sick ideas from the past
This is this our refugees never gonna die
All hail the new blood flowing from life again
You take with all our breed and no respect to life

The operator, pass down to us control
The walk and wicked of all going to the wall

This life is so dead, consuming to the bone
Expand the pieces crushing to the face of all
From equal slayers ff the earth, I hear the moan
A wretch destroys to wipe us from this race.

I Puncture inflame, what do and destroy
Filth soured from this world
Depends on our souls

From all blood and salt

// Our Time Is Now //

Thunder!
You made us!
Your mental state afraid of mystic ways
No matter how hard you try, you're bitter all the time
The light we follow, our time is on!
We must let go of the weight pulling us down

Realize you're not alone
They'll love you like a god
Get out there, you belong
Now!

Our time is now!
To conquer!
Our time is now!
Or never!

Thunder!
You raised us!
We've been deceived, today the world is blind
We've lost our sight to the bottom of the sea
No way! Our back to the wall
We'll change the rules, disobey the mentor

Realize you're not alone
They'll love you like a god
Get out there, you belong
Now!

Our time is now!
To conquer!
Our time is now!
For ever!

Realize you're not alone
They love you like a god
Get out and seize the day
Wow!
