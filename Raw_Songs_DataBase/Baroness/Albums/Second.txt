Album: Second

// Red Sky //

All fall, as one, as none
Tooth and skin collide
Tide will bury
Buried, buried

Build broken into new

All fall, we've been here for days stuck on shipless sea,
We've got nothing left we raise our eyes to see end of endless fleet,
Tide will bury, we sleep for now

Build broken into new

Blood will turn slave sin to stone,
And stone will carry us back to solid shore

// Son Of Sun //

Soul swallowed without heat absolved,
I am spirit never born but dreamed,

Heart heats head
Head speaks truth

Legs unchained
Limbs enslaved

Now, as the son
Return to flame

// Vision //

Now never has begun
Now traitor has been shown

Now monarch rests unthroned
Now vision rides alone

Free from vision
