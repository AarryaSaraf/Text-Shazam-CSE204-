Knives fall
Pale sun
Night's fall
Pale sun sinking

Knives fall
Pale sun
Night's fall
Pale sun sinking

Night fall
Panic setting in again around me
Night fall
You've hidden your black eyes away again
Knives fall
I don't want to hear
The sound of breaking skin
Knives fall
Of fear and darkness
Coming down around me

Knives fall
Pale sun
Night's fall
Pale sun sinking

Knives fall
Pale sun
Night's fall
Pale sun sinking
