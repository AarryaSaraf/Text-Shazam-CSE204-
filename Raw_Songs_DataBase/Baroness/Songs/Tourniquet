Bought an artificial heart and it's broken
It never started
Please operator, take it out of here
Don't let it be the death of me
Filled my bloodstream up with poison and ashes
Now I'm starving
Don't ever let me go, my sweet amphetamine
Holding on, all alone

Somebody throw me a tourniquet
I'm open-hearted
I took a shot in the dark and I'm wasted
Start it all again
I tried to save myself from a heart attack
But I had it coming
Another shot to my cardiac
Did not start it up

Wake me up on the ocean floor
A storm's passing overhead
Warning me to come ashore
In the blink of an eye
My heart still breaks
My blood still waits
I'll never sleep alone

I've got an artificial heart
It beats but I can't feel a thing
It's an unofficial part
It bleeds but I'm already gone

Better hurry up with the tourniquet
'Cause I'm open-hearted
Please operator, take it out of here
And start it up

I've got an artificial heart
It beats but I can't feel a thing
It's an unofficial part
It bleeds but I'm already gone
