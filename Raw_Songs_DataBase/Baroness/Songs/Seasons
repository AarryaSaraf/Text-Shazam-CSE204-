Where are the seasons that have passed?
Wouldn't they wait?
Staring outside the window, trashed
Swimming inside me

Where are the shadows I have cast?
Wouldn't they wait?
Didn't they find the way out
Living inside me?

We fall
We rise
We bend
We break
We burn but we survive

Forget me when I'm gone
Settle in and don't forget to go to bed
You tucked your fingers away
All of the seasons that I have lost
Where did they run and hide?
Where do we go when the well runs dry?
Seasons all we know

We fall
We rise
We bend
We break
We burn, but we survive

We fall
We rise
We bend
We break
We burn, but we survive

We fall
We rise
We bend
We break
We burn, but we survive
