Four seed forest, laurels fade.
Thrice fed famine, balance made.
The cycle has begun.
Closure of an age 
Becomes the season of the spirit 
When the air is rent in two, 
And bone and blood have forgotten. 
C'est le temps de la 
Saison rouge de la terre. 
The fire of night blinds the seed unchained. 
The will to rise is out of turn.
Electric storm will strip it clean. 
It is a boiling and dripping burn
To taste the solar flare and see.
You will never see this season burn.
Then. now. ever. again.
