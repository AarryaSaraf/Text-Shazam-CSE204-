// Knockin' Boots //

This truck needs a half tank
These wheels need a two lane
This radio needs three songs to play
To get me 'cross town to you

That dress needs a slip-off
That hair needs to come down
Friday nights need to do
What Friday nights need to do
That's the truth

Yeah birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
Fishin' in the dark needs nitty gritty
Under that pale moon

Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots

Knockin' boots, me and you, oh

Long weeks need a weekend
Cheap drinks need a slingin'
That dance floor needs some me on you
And you on me tonight

Sing-alongs need to be sung
Tip bells need to be rung
Last calls need to call that cab
And back seats need "I want you so bad"

Yeah birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
Fishin' in the dark needs nitty gritty
Under that pale moon

Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots

Knockin boots, girl, me and you

Doors need shuttin'
Lights need cuttin'
Lips need lockin'
Boots need knockin'

And birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
Fishin' in the dark needs nitty gritty
Under that pale moon

Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots

Knockin' boots, me and you
Oh, knockin' boots

// What She Wants Tonight //

She walks up, velvet rope unhooks
She snaps her fingers and a drink comes
She locks you down with just one look
She's got this whole club undone

If she's on the rebound, you ain't gonna know it
Coming off a heartbreak, she ain't gonna show it
She's eyes caught, red dot, locked on me, yeah

She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said, she ain't going home till we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye
She don't take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
And I get to be what she wants tonight

I get to catch all her secrets
Sequins bouncing off flashing lights
If she wants it then we're leaving
Get me home, park the truck, cut the tires

I get to be where she goes when she's lonely
The last door of the night she's closing
Oh, I know she could have anything but

She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said she ain't going home till we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye
She don't take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
And I get to be what she wants tonight

And I don't know how I got to be the only thing she needs right now

She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said she ain't going home till we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye
She don't take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
And I get to be what she wants tonight

And I get to be what she wants tonight, tonight

// Born Here Live Here Die Here //

Bunch of buddies in John Deere hats
A little crazy but they got my back
Know every roll-through stop sign like the back of my hand
And every bank where the fish will bite
Still like putting a smile on the face
Of a girl I've known since the second grade
Got a kiss that's sweet like lemonade
She's everything I'll ever need
Another reason I'll never leave

Born here, live here, die here
From the roots, to the boots, to the lay me down suit
Yeah, I'm gonna be proud to be right here
Just like my daddy, and his daddy did too
Ride the same roads, work the same dirt
Go to the same church and drink the same beer
Born here, live here, die here
Yeah

Everybody's gotta find their place
Some dreams you catch, some dreams you chase
Some people run and some people stay
Me, I'll always be a

Born here, live here, die here
From the roots, to the boots, to the lay me down suit
Yeah, I'm gonna be proud to be right here
Just like my daddy, and his daddy did too
Ride the same roads, work the same dirt
Go to the same church and drink the same beer
Born here, live here, die here
Yeah

I'm gonna raise one up in the air tonight
For all the folks like me, here's to the

Born here, live here, die here
From the roots, to the boots, to the lay me down suit
Yeah, I'm gonna be proud to be right here
Just like my daddy and his daddy did too
We ride the same roads, work the same dirt
Go to the same church and drink the same beer

Born here, live here, die here
Born here, live here, die here
Born here, live here, die here
Yeah

Born here, live here, die here
I'll be right here

// One Margarita //

Everybody here ain't from here
But we're here doin' our thing
Lettin' go a little, little by little
Sippin' on a frozen drink

Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces a-shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, it goes like

One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
Hey Señorita, don't you think we need
A salt and a Buffett song
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita
We'll be gone

Ice blue skies, shades on the eyes
To tuck the bloodshot away
Hair of the dog, shouldn't take long
But who cares, we got all day
Palm trees a-leanin', sunburn a-screamin'
But we'll all be alright, after

One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
Hey Señorita, don't you think we need
A salt and a Marley song
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita
We'll be gone
We'll be gone

Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces a-shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, feelin' no pain
It goes like

One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
Hey Señorita, don't you think we need
A salt and a Chesney song
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita
We'll be gone
We'll be gone
We'll be gone

// Too Drunk To Drive //

There ain't a liquor store, dive bar, or corner booth for twenty miles around
We ain't on a boat, on a lake, in the sun with the cooler loaded down
But suddenly, I'm feeling all impaired from the way you looked at me from over there
Rolling like I'm stoned past gone, looking in your eyes

Girl, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too drunk to drive
What do I do with you? Let's lay it low tonight
Got me high, got me right, got me flyin' 'cause you're looking so fine
I ain't had no shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive

You can hide my keys, lock the door, maybe we can find something here to do
Maybe wreck some sheets, crash your lips into mine and not even make the news
These four walls are safer than them two lanes
You pour 'em tall when you start whispering my name
Ain't no blue light, line walkin', happening tonight

Girl, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too drunk to drive
What do I do with you? Let's lay it low tonight
Got me high, got me right, got me flyin' 'cause you're looking so fine
I ain't had no shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive
Yeah, I'm too drunk to drive

Yeah girl, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too drunk to drive
What do I do with you? Let's lay it low tonight
Got me high, got me right, got me flyin' 'cause you're looking so fine
I ain't had no shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive
No, I ain't had a shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive
I'm just too drunk to drive
I'm too drunk to drive
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm too drunk to drive

// Build Me A Daddy //

A boy walks past a window of a glowing, open sign
Full of wooden toys and trucks and painted trains
Rings a bell up on the counter, hands a picture to the man
Of a kid beside a soldier smiling away
Said, "Sir, I've heard you can build anything"

Could you build me a daddy?
Strong as Superman
Make him 10 feet tall with a southern drawl and a crooked smile if you can
'Cause I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back?
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make Momma happy, if you could build me a daddy

There's an old Winchester rifle, back home hanging on the wall
He promised me, he'd teach me how to aim
And he said, when I got older, we could work on that curveball
I know he'd never wanna miss a game
So, here's a little money that I've saved

Could you build me a daddy?
Strong as Superman
Make him 10 feet tall with a southern drawl and a crooked smile if you can
I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make Momma happy, if you could build me a daddy

Give him a big heart, make his arms wide open
I know he misses me, so Mister, I was hoping

You could build me a daddy
Strong as Superman
Make him 10 feet tall with a southern drawl and a fishing pole in his hand
'Cause I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make my momma happy, if you could you build me a daddy

Could you build me a daddy?

// Little Less Broken //

Of all the bars you could've walked your boots into
Why'd it have to be the one that I picked too?
I just wanted a place to sip my way through, missin' you
You didn't see me when you walked past me
I wasn't ready to see you this happy

Looks like I'm movin' just a little less on with this
Looks like your world has got a little less wrong with it
Looks like it took you just a little less time
Looks like your heart's just a little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine

To hell with killin' what's left of this Walker Black
'Cause I ain't lettin' you know that I hurt this bad
I'll just hang my head underneath this hat, and slip out the back
I'm dealin' with not being together
So are you but you're doin' it better

It looks like I'm movin' just a little less on with this
Looks like your world has got a little less wrong with it
Looks like it took you just a little less time
Looks like your heart's just a little less broken than mine
Maybe goodbye didn't hit you the way that it hit me
Guess hearts don't ever break 50/50
Oh, 'cause it

Looks like I'm movin' just a little less on with this
Looks like your world has got a little less wrong with it
Looks like it's takin' me a little more time
'Cause baby your heart's just a little less broken, a little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine

A little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine...

// For A Boat //

Everything I learned about life
I learned out on that bank
From gettin' up early, comin' up empty
And good things come to those that wait

Money doesn't grow on trees
The difference in talking, and shootin' the breeze

I remember thinkin', wouldn't it be cool
To have an old flat bottom and an Evinrude
And Daddy saying, "Son, don't they bite just fine right here"
He'd say, "Love what you got, buddy, not what you ain't
And just about then that bobber would sink
And that outboard dream of mine would disappear
I grew up pretty lucky as far as lucky goes
Too broke for a boat

He coulda picked up an extra shift
Or a weekend at the factory
But every Sunday was saved for Jesus
And Saturdays, he spent with me

'Til that summer would fall
I didn't know we had it all

I remember thinkin', wouldn't it be cool
To have an old flat bottom and an Evinrude
And Daddy saying, "Son, don't they bite just fine right here"
He'd say, "Love what you got, buddy, not what you ain't
And just about then that bobber would sink
And that outboard dream of mine would disappear
I grew up pretty lucky as far as lucky goes
Too broke for a boat
Too broke for a boat

I remember thinkin', wouldn't it be cool
To have an old flat bottom and an Evinrude
And Daddy saying, "Son, don't they bite just fine right here"
He'd say, "Love what you got, buddy, not what you ain't
And just about then that bobber would sink
And that outboard dream of mine would disappear
I grew up pretty lucky as far as lucky goes
Too broke for a boat
Too broke for a boat

// Where Are We Goin' //

Ooh

Where are we goin', when we leave here?
When the music's over and the bar runs out of beer
If we stay too late, they're gonna kick us out
Is it cool if I come crash at your house?

Where are we going? The night is young
And we're both half sober, hell-bent on having fun
You say if we hook up, there'll be no-strings attached
Save my number, you don't have to call me back

Let's have some cigarettes and find a spot that ain't closed yet
And if it is, we'll buy a box of wine
I just had to talk to you, forgive me if this comes out rude
You got to know it's true, but girl you look so fine

Where are we going? If nowhere else
There's an old field road out past the shutdown Shell
We could shine those eyes, we could count them stars
Borrow some signs, go fishing in the dark

We'll sing some old Hank Jr. songs, "Outlaw Women" all night long
Make some good 'ol down home memories
There's something 'bout the sky tonight, something 'bout your blue eyes
Baby, you remind me of my sweetest dream
My sweetest dream
My sweetest dream
Yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah

Where are we going? If this is love
There's no way to know but just between the two of us
It all feels so right with you in my arms
Where it's going, I don't know, but let's keep following our hearts

Ooh-ooh
Yeah
Mm-mmm

// Down To One //

We were counting one star at a time
One fell out of the sky
You had your eyes closed, you were wishing on 'em
I was thinking 'bout your lips, girl and kissin' on 'em
We were sitting in the light of the moon
I was watching it shine on you
Funny how time flies with a good girl
On a good night

We were down to 1AM
Listening to one more song
Thinking I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light in the back of that two-tone, half-ton
My heart was telling me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight falling in love
Right there that night
Down to one

Said, we leave in one more minute
One passed by but we didn't
'Cause you were looking like a dream I'd been dreaming
I was thinking about anything but leaving
Still feel that touch
You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love
Never been that far

Down to 1 AM
Listening to one more song
Thinking I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light in the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was telling me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight falling in love
Right there that night
Down to one

I was saying, stay with me
I'll be everything you need

We were way past 1 AM
Listening to one more song
Thinking I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light in the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was telling me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight falling in love
Right there that night
Down to one

Down to one
I was saying, stay with me
I'll be everything you need
Down to one, down to one

// Country Does //

Old boat, new boat
Red boat, blue boat
Only thing better than one is two boats
Big church, small church
Come one, come all church

New sound, old sound
Small town, old town
If you're drinking, better have enough for the whole town
Red dirt, clay dirt
Trying to get to paydirt

Country did as country does
Long as the salt gets licked, and the corn grows thick and the sun comes up
Country is as country was
And 'round here, the good old days ain't far away, 'cause they can't change us
Proud of your family, proud of your name
Proud of the mud running through your veins
They say nothing don't ever stay the way it was
But country does
Country does

Old folks, kinfolks
Those folks, them folks
Talk about us, gonna take it on the chin folks
Farm work, hard work
Kids do the yardwork

Slow song, sad song
Growing up on dad's songs
Long as there's fiddle, hell, there really ain't a bad song
Cold beer, cheap beer
Plant our roots and our boots and our feet here

Country did as country does
Long as the salt gets licked, and the corn grows thick and the sun comes up
Country is as country was
And 'round here, the good old days ain't far away, 'cause you can't change us
Proud of your family, proud of your name
Proud of the mud running through your veins
They say nothing don't ever stay the way it was
But country does
Country does

Country did as country does
Long as the salt gets licked, and the corn grows thick and the sun comes up
Country is as country was
And 'round here, the good old days ain't far away, 'cause they can't change us
Proud of your family, proud of your name
Proud of the mud running through your veins
They say nothing don't ever stay the way it was
But country does
Country does, yeah

Country does

Proud of your family
Proud of your name
Proud of the mud running through your veins
Proud of your family
Proud of your name
Proud of the mud running through your veins...

// Drink A Little Whiskey Down //

I'm back takin' the long way when I go home at night
And your memory don't dance down the hallway when I flip on the light
I'm back spendin' time with my buddies
A little rowdy ain't hurtin' nobody
Yeah, I've come a long way gettin' over us
But now and then when your name comes up

I drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down
When the wonderin' if you miss me missin' you comes around
Yeah, it don't happen like it used to happen
But when it does, I twist off a cap and
Drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down

No more 2 a.m. phone calls to act like I'm checkin' in
No more runnin' the other way when I run into your friends
I don't need your touch, need your smile
Except for every little once in a while then

I drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down
When the wonderin' if you miss me missin' you comes around
Yeah, it don't happen like it used to happen
But when it does, I twist off a cap and
Drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down
Drink a little whiskey down

Yeah just enough to get you gone
Grab a glass and pour one strong

I drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down
When the wonderin' if you miss me missin' you comes around
Yeah, it don't happen like it used to happen
But when it does, I twist off a cap and
Drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down
Drink a little whiskey down
Drink a little whiskey down
Drink a little whiskey down
Drink a little whiskey down

// Waves //

It's like the sun went down just to frame your face
Like they played that song just to see you sway
Like that old surf shop had you in mind
With what you got on, making those tan lines

It's like the ocean knows we're laying
On this beach tonight
It's like the sand's been waiting
For you to come alive 'cause

You were made for summer
Just like these stars we're under
We're made for lighting this July sky up
Blanket down made for me and you tied up
All night long, over and over
Crash into me and pull me closer
Kiss by kiss, one after another
Don't let go, baby, let this summer
Just keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves
Keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves

Wish I could bottle up the taste on your lips
That margarita saltwater sunburned sip
It's like I feel that sun right next to me
Yeah, girl, your touch is a hundred degrees

Boardwalks were made for dancing
And flip flops were made to lose like
This night was meant to happen
And, girl, I was made for you like

You were made for summer
Just like these stars we're under
We're made for lighting this July sky up
Blanket down made for me and you tied up
All night long, over and over
Crash into me and pull me closer
Kiss by kiss, one after another
Don't let go, baby, let this summer
Just keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves
Keep on coming in waves

Keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves
Keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves

Baby, you were made for summer
Just like these stars we're under
We're made for lighting this July sky up
Blanket down made for me and you tied up
All night long, over and over
Crash into me and pull me closer
Kiss by kiss, one after another
Don't let go, baby, let this summer
Just keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves
Keep on coming in waves
Keep coming in waves

// Bill Dance //

This ain't no lie

Saved all my birthday money up
Put it down on a rod and reel
I got my green and tan Plano loaded up
Permission to fish behind that old sawmill
Momma said, "Watch for snakes"
Daddy said, "Shut the gate"
Brother said, "They're biting on the zoom black and red flake"
Laying in the bed that night
I swear I could barely sleep

'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance
Fishing for a living
Saturday morning on television
A Georgia boy learning how to hook big bass
From a large mouth legend in a Tennessee hat
Taught me how to tie 'em on
Taught me how to take 'em off
Taught me how to catch 'em when they said they couldn't be caught
Nobody ever had to worry about me
'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance

While other boys were playing ball and knocking heads
I was floating on the Muckalee
While rebel kids were smoking, stealing cigarettes
I was fishing in them cypress trees
Paddle and a Jon Boat, nine pound, no joke
Got him in the net cause I didn't get my line broke
Using every trick in the book Daddy ever taught me

'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance
Fishing for a living
Saturday morning on television
A Georgia boy learning how to hook big bass
From a large mouth legend in a Tennessee hat
Taught me how to tie 'em on
Taught me how to take 'em off
Taught me how to catch 'em when they said they couldn't be caught
Nobody ever had to worry about me
'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance

There's a lot of heroes out there these days
But if you ask me mine, there's only one name I'll say

Bill Dance, fishing for a living
Saturday morning on television
A Georgia boy learning how to hook big bass
From the best damn fisherman the world's ever had
Taught me how to tie 'em on
Taught me how to take 'em off
Taught me how to catch 'em when they said they couldn't be caught
Nobody ever had to worry about me
'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance
Bill Dance

Yeah, the sun is just starting to shine up over the treetops
It's gonna be a beautiful day, it's plain to see

// Up //

Up
Early in the morning wakin' that sun
Up
Fillin' that coffee, crankin' that tractor
Up
Prayin' it rains down on the devil's dust
Them rows come poppin'

Up
In the sky, there's a guy
Lookin' down on us
Lookin' up
Our whole life, raised up right
In a town nobody knows
What a way to grow

Up
Rollin' 'round town in a hand me down old pickup
Pullin' in the driveway pickin' that pretty thang
Up
Just layin' low where heaven and a dirt road touch
Holdin' a cold one

Up
In the sky, there's a guy
Lookin' down on us
Lookin' up
Our whole life, raised up right
In a town nobody knows
What a way to grow
Up

Up
On a Sunday pond bank tearin' that crank bait
Up
Livin' for a Friday, runnin' that scoreboard
Up
Keepin' that faith, waitin' on the day He calls us

Up
In the sky, there's a guy
Lookin' down on us
Lookin' up
Our whole life, raised up right
In a town nobody knows
What a way to grow
Up

// Floatin' This Creek //

Put in this morning at first light
Had a biscuit on my way down
I was sittin' there waitin' on the first bite
From a rainbow or a brown

Anchor down at the bridge, gonna try a new midge
There was traffic flyin' by
Taillights glowin' red, thirty feet overhead
But it felt like a thousand miles

I'm just floatin' this creek and takin' it slow
Tryin' to catch somethin' big, sip somethin' cold
I'd be a liar if I said I had a plan today

'Cept watch these banks roll by, take it on in
Don't get too deep, don't forget where I been
Nothin' but time to see where it takes me
Floatin' this creek

That rush hour traffic kinda slowed down
'Bout the time that the fish did too
Just me and this ol' green boat now
Nothin' but nothin' to do

So I broke out a cold one, called my buddies, told 'em
Slipped up and caught a state record
That's a little white lie, he was good eatin' size
But I like my story better

I'm just floatin' this creek and takin' it slow
Tryin' to catch somethin' big and sip somethin' cold
I'd be a liar if I said I had a plan today

'Cept watch these banks roll by, take it all in
Don't get too deep, don't forget where I been
Nothin' but time to see where it takes me
Yeah, I'm just floatin' this creek

Put my boat back on the trailer, eased out on the blacktop
Kinda sucks but I gotta make a dollar
I'm feeling pretty good, so I won't bitch
'Cause in the morning when I'm diggin' that ditch

I'll be floatin' this creek and taking it slow
Tryin' to catch somethin' big and sip somethin' cold
I'd be a liar if I said I had a plan today

'Cept watch these banks roll by, take it all in
Don't get too deep, don't forget where I been
Nothin' but time to see where it takes me
Floatin' this creek

Floatin' this creek
