// I Do All My Dreamin' There //

You know I got me a spot somewhere
Come on

There's a little place down an overgrown road
Nobody but me in the whole world knows
Been going there ever since I was a kid
On my red dirt bike with my blue tick Sid

Spend a lot of long summer nights
With the hoot owls and the satellites
Ain't the kind of place that I ever shared
But come on with me, and let me take you where

I do my bobber-sinking
Peanut-butter-sandwich-eatin'
Watching the world go by
Where I've done some beer-crackin'
Crying, praying, laughin'
Just talking to the man in the sky

Baby, jump on in
There's a huckleberry limb
We can leave our cut-offs and our cares
Who knows what can happen
With the summer sweet jasmine in the air?
I do all my dreamin' there!

There's a big oak on the other side
Where I took my grandpa's pocket knife
And I carved their names with tears in my eyes
When he joined grandma in the by and by

Got it right here in the dashboard box
Tip broke off and the blade don't lock
But I bet it'd carve our names just fine
If you wanna come along with me next time

I do my bobber-sinking
Peanut-butter-sandwich-eatin'
Watching the world go by
Where I've done some beer-crackin'
Crying, praying, laughin'
Just talking to the man in the sky

Baby, jump on in
There's a huckleberry limb
We can leave our cut-offs and our cares
Who knows what can happen
With the summer sweet jasmine in the air?
I do all my dreamin' there!

Yeah, I've done some bobber-sinking
Peanut-butter-sandwich-eatin'
Watching the world go by
Where I've done some beer-crackin'
Crying, praying, laughin'
Just talking to the big man in the sky

Baby, jump on in,
There's a huckleberry limb
We can leave our cut-offs and our cares
Who knows what can happen
With the summer sweet jasmine in the air?
I do all my dreamin' there!

Right there, ha ha ha!

// Here's To The Farmer //

Talk about an uphill battle
2000 acres of beans and cattle
But he don't ever get rattled
He just goes 'til the sun goes down
Hydraulic fluid on his jeans
Red dye diesel and ten rows between
A cold one on the porch and a good nights of sleep
Y'all hold 'em up with me now

Here's to the farmer that plants the fields in the spring
That turn from green to that harvest honey
Hold one up for the banker downtown
That got him on his feet with handshake money
Here's to the farmer's wife
That loves him every night
Raising a son, raising a daughter
They gather 'round the table, send it up to the Father
Somehow they get closer when times get harder
Here's to the farmer

Subdivision's creeping on in
Neighborhood kids keep jumping his fence
He could double his money
But that'd be the end of a promise he'll never break
Cause he looked his daddy in the eye
And he's got that stubborn pride
He'll be here 'til the day he dies
No, he wouldn't have it any other way

Here's to the farmer that plants the fields in the spring
That turn from green to that harvest honey
Hold one up for the banker downtown
That got him on his feet with handshake money
Here's to the farmer's wife
That loves him every night
Raising a son, raising a daughter
They gather 'round the table, send it up to the Father
Somehow they get closer when times get harder
Here's to the farmer

Yeah, here's to the farmer that loves his day in the sun
Won't sell that old half-ton
Nobody knows better 'bout a hard-earned dollar
Just tell him how far he's gotta go and he'll go further
Here's to the farmer
Here's to the farmer
Thank you, boys

// Love Me In A Field //

Don't need a hotel or a high rise
A big old bunk bed a fancy name
I don't need a backseat, don't need no rusty truck
We could leave that dust on that old porch swing

Let's get tangled in the tassels of some ten foot corn
Tear our t-shirts in the cotton patch behind the barn
Get lost out on the grass bring your blanket in the beach
Tear up some turnip rings or find some up on a hill
Baby love me in a field

Now we got that California king
In the back of that Georgia double wire
And I'm about to bust out the seams
When I get you to the country side
What's that sound like to you?
Cuz it sounds dang good to me
Just hit me with a smile when you're ready to leave

Let's get tangled in the tassels of some ten foot corn
Tear our t-shirts in the cotton patch behind the barn
Get lost out on the grass bring your blanket in the beach
Tear up some turnip rings or find some up on a hill
Baby love me in a field

Find an old pasture
Where the cows ain't
Been for a while
Wanna see your blue eyes
Where the flowers go wild
Little after midnight
Morning dew
On our skin

I'm sure that nobody, nobody know where we've been.

Let's get tangled in the tassels of some ten foot corn
Tear our t-shirts in the cotton patch behind the barn
Get lost out on the grass bring your blanket in the beach
Tear up some turnip rings or find some up on a hill
Baby love me in a field

// You Look Like Rain //

You and your sunday mornings
Me and my saturday nights
You and all your colors
Me and my black and whites
You and your lace and cotton
Up against my whiskey skin
Saving me the way you always do again

Cause I'm hell up here on the high wire
You're the hallelujah kind
I'm the dust that spins
In a gust of wind that's blowing by
I'm a desert dry
And in my thirsty eyes
You look like rain

You and your stained glass windows
Me and my cracked windshield
You and your quiet beauty
Me and my can't sit still

Cause I'm hell up here on the high wire
You're the hallelujah kind
I'm the dust that spins
In a gust of wind that's blowing by
I'm a desert dry
And in my thirsty eyes
You look like rain

Girl I'm hell up here on the high wire
You're the hallelujah kind
I'm the dust that spins
In a gust of wind that's blowing by
I'm a desert dry
And in my thirsty eyes
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You're my sweet rain

// Southern Gentleman //

You looked at me like I was crazy,
When I said mam'm to that little old lady
You ain't heard talk like that lately,
But I can see, it's got you smilin'

And you say you still remember,
our first date me cookin' you dinner
And how I didn't even try to
kiss you at the end of the date
Cause I was raised to

Stand up when you walk in the door,
Spin you around an old heart pine floor
Rock you baby on a wraparound porch,
Underneath a magnolia blossom

Walk you down old live oak road,
Barefoot bridge see a sunset show
Say I love you when I pull you close,
and you know it's true, as the gospel
Ain't nobody gonna love you better than,
this southern gentleman

I'm gonna, open up these plantation blinds,
to the sun coming up in your pretty blue eyes
Tell you you're beautiful a thousand times a day
'Til your in love with the way that I

Stand up when you walk in the door,
Spin you around an old heart pine floor
Rock you baby on a wraparound porch,
Underneath a magnolia blossom

Walk you down old live oak road,
Barefoot bridge see a sunset show
Say I love you when I pull you close,
and you know it's true, as the gospel
Ain't nobody gonna love you better than,
this southern gentleman

Girl I'm gonna take you on a trip like back in time
Just put your hand in mine, and won't you

Stand up when you walk in the door,
Spin you around an old heart pine floor
Rock you baby on a wraparound porch,
Underneath a magnolia blossom

Walk you down old live oak road,
Barefoot bridge see a sunset show
Say I love you when I pull you close,
and you know it's true, as the gospel
Ain't nobody gonna love you better than,
this southern gentleman
