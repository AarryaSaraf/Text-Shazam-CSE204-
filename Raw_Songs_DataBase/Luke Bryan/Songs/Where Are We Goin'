Ooh

Where are we goin', when we leave here?
When the music's over and the bar runs out of beer
If we stay too late, they're gonna kick us out
Is it cool if I come crash at your house?

Where are we going? The night is young
And we're both half sober, hell-bent on having fun
You say if we hook up, there'll be no-strings attached
Save my number, you don't have to call me back

Let's have some cigarettes and find a spot that ain't closed yet
And if it is, we'll buy a box of wine
I just had to talk to you, forgive me if this comes out rude
You got to know it's true, but girl you look so fine

Where are we going? If nowhere else
There's an old field road out past the shutdown Shell
We could shine those eyes, we could count them stars
Borrow some signs, go fishing in the dark

We'll sing some old Hank Jr. songs, "Outlaw Women" all night long
Make some good 'ol down home memories
There's something 'bout the sky tonight, something 'bout your blue eyes
Baby, you remind me of my sweetest dream
My sweetest dream
My sweetest dream
Yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah

Where are we going? If this is love
There's no way to know but just between the two of us
It all feels so right with you in my arms
Where it's going, I don't know, but let's keep following our hearts

Ooh-ooh
Yeah
Mm-mmm
