I heard "Run" on the radio, yesterday
Got me thinking 'bout, how much you love George Strait
But by the time the airwaves ever played that song
You were already gone, you were already home

And there ain't no one that sounds like Whitley
But I'd bet you find something you'd sing with me
We weren't just

Killing time singing "Killin' Time"
It was the soundtrack of our lives
Chasing girls and growing up
A lot about living, a little 'bout love
Time marches on, there's a lot of new
Music and memories we'd be drinking to
I think about it and I laugh until it hurts
'Cause I can hear you singing along
To songs you never heard

Everything sounded better with the windows down
In your Silverado, rolling 'round that two lane town
Now there's a few more ball caps, a few less cowboy hats
But we're still singing 'bout dirt roads
I think you'd be okay with that

And I'm thinking about the way you would've acted
The first time you ever heard "In Color"
Man, it makes me wanna go back
When we were just

Killing time singing "Killin' Time"
It was the soundtrack of our lives
Chasing girls and growing up
A lot about living, a little 'bout love
Time marches on, there's a lot of new
Music and memories we'd be drinking to
I think about it and I laugh until it hurts
'Cause I can hear you singing along
To songs you never heard

You'd be a little off key
Out on the road with me
High fiving my whole band
Mama claims it but we all know
You'd be my number one fan
And we'd be

Killing time singing "Killin' Time"
It was the soundtrack of our lives
Chasing girls and growing up
A lot about living, a little 'bout love
Time marches on, there's a lot of new
Music and memories we'd be drinking to
I think about it and I laugh until it hurts
'Cause I can hear you singing along
To songs you never heard

To songs you never heard
