There ain't a liquor store, dive bar, or corner booth for twenty miles around
We ain't on a boat, on a lake, in the sun with the cooler loaded down
But suddenly, I'm feeling all impaired from the way you looked at me from over there
Rolling like I'm stoned past gone, looking in your eyes

Girl, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too drunk to drive
What do I do with you? Let's lay it low tonight
Got me high, got me right, got me flyin' 'cause you're looking so fine
I ain't had no shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive

You can hide my keys, lock the door, maybe we can find something here to do
Maybe wreck some sheets, crash your lips into mine and not even make the news
These four walls are safer than them two lanes
You pour 'em tall when you start whispering my name
Ain't no blue light, line walkin', happening tonight

Girl, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too drunk to drive
What do I do with you? Let's lay it low tonight
Got me high, got me right, got me flyin' 'cause you're looking so fine
I ain't had no shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive
Yeah, I'm too drunk to drive

Yeah girl, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too drunk to drive
What do I do with you? Let's lay it low tonight
Got me high, got me right, got me flyin' 'cause you're looking so fine
I ain't had no shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive
No, I ain't had a shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive
I'm just too drunk to drive
I'm too drunk to drive
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm too drunk to drive
