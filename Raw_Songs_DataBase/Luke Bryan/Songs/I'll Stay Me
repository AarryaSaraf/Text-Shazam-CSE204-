T-shirt, blue jeans
Don't like much on TV
Caviar and a Triscut
Aren't non Redeye gravy on a biscuit
My deep Southern drawl
Makes the conversation crawl
You're going to have to hang around
Long enough to hear me out
Some folks aren't happy like they are
Some want to take things just a little too far

Singers want to be Hollywood actors
And millionaires want to ride
Old farm tractors
I am just what I am
I'm just what you see
So I'll make it easy
I'll stay me

My granny and pawpaw
Still missing Hee Haw
And I love my little town
Where the people don't let you down
There's a girl down the street
Got a kiss just waiting on me
Hot dog sweet potato fries
When I go over tonight
She knows exactly who I am
A soft touching her love loving
Hardworking man

Quarterbacks want to play lead guitar
And supermodels want smaller body parts
Change is good sometimes
But I still believe
I'm going to make it easy
I'll stay me

Yeah singers want to be
Hollywood actors
And millionaires want to ride
Old farm tractors
I am just what I am
I'm just what you see
So I'll make it easy
I'll stay me

I'll stay me, I'm going to make it easy
I'll stay me
