My shoulders still burn, my head still hurts
There's sand from your shoes in my floorboard, and lipstick on a straw,
Your crying eyes are painted in my rear view
My speakers still blast that song that you turned me on to

It's like that blue water ran up the highway
That salt air is pulling on my tail gate
And that sunset is still hanging on
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up-all-nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah, I was a fool to think I could just move on
'Cause you and the beach followed me home

Still hear your words saying we can't do this
'Cause you're up there and I'm down here
Baby let's go on and face it

It's like that blue water ran up the highway
That salt air is pulling on my tail gate
And that sunset is still hanging on
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up-all-nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah, I was a fool to think I could just move on
'Cause you and the beach followed me home

I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up-all-nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah, I was a fool to think I could just move on
'Cause there you are everytime I close my eyes
It's like we never even said goodbye
It don't feel like you're really gone
You and the beach followed me home
