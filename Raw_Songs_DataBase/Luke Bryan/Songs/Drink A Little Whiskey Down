I'm back takin' the long way when I go home at night
And your memory don't dance down the hallway when I flip on the light
I'm back spendin' time with my buddies
A little rowdy ain't hurtin' nobody
Yeah, I've come a long way gettin' over us
But now and then when your name comes up

I drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down
When the wonderin' if you miss me missin' you comes around
Yeah, it don't happen like it used to happen
But when it does, I twist off a cap and
Drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down

No more 2 a.m. phone calls to act like I'm checkin' in
No more runnin' the other way when I run into your friends
I don't need your touch, need your smile
Except for every little once in a while then

I drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down
When the wonderin' if you miss me missin' you comes around
Yeah, it don't happen like it used to happen
But when it does, I twist off a cap and
Drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down
Drink a little whiskey down

Yeah just enough to get you gone
Grab a glass and pour one strong

I drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down
When the wonderin' if you miss me missin' you comes around
Yeah, it don't happen like it used to happen
But when it does, I twist off a cap and
Drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down
Drink a little whiskey down
Drink a little whiskey down
Drink a little whiskey down
Drink a little whiskey down
