I guess we don't quite understand down here
What makes Him do the things He does
Why some people go so soon
While some grow old
I've learned we're just a step away
And tomorrow might be kind of tough
Nothings promised in this life
All you can do is believe


So it must have been the way the sunlight hit you
And shined upon your face
Or how the rain would find you 
On the driest of days
Your smile in the morning 
The way you'd reach for the sky
How you danced in the breeze
As people walked by
So it must be true
What I once heard
God picks His favorite flowers first

I bet He put you in his window sill
Looking out over this big old world
And I know Heaven sure does love
Having you around
In His eyes we're all the same
But I just gotta think when He saw you
And how perfect and pretty you were
He just couldn't wait



Yeah it must have been the way the sunlight hit you
And shined upon your face
Or how the rain would find you 
On the driest of days
Your smile in the morning
The way you'd reach for the sky
How you danced in the breeze
As people walked by
So it must be true
What I once heard
God picks His favorite flowers first

Yeah it must be true
What I once heard

God picks His favorite
God picks His favorite
Flowers first
