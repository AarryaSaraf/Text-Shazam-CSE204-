Grabbed my phone, rolled outta bed
Went back through all the texts I sent
Half-drunk beer on my nightstand
and a red club stamp on my right hand
Tripped on my boots walking down the hall
Chuggin' sink water, staring at the wall
Trying to put the pieces back together again
Who did how, what, where and when?

Oh hell yeah my head hurts
I got whiskey and lip gloss on my new shirt
All I know is we went out and done it up right
I rode a bull, did a keg stand, shot gunned a beer can, jumped in and broke up a fight
Now it's Saturday morning, I'm hungover, but damn what a Friday night 

I think I left my debit card at the bar
Think I took a kiss a little too far
Who's that sleeping on my couch?
I gotta whole lotta drunk drama left to sort out

Oh hell yeah my head hurts
I got whiskey and lip gloss on my new shirt
All I know is we went out and done it up right
I was on stage with the band, holding up a beer can, everyone was losing their minds
Now it's Saturday morning, I'm hungover, but damn what a Friday night 

Oh hell yeah my head hurts
Now that I come to think about it this ain't my shirt
All I know is I went out and done it up right
Got in a fight with my girlfriend, threw down my beer can, and still had the time of my life
Now it's Saturday morning, I'm hungover, but damn what a Friday night 

Yeah, yeah now it's Saturday morning, I'm hungover, but damn what a Friday night 
Man what a Friday night
