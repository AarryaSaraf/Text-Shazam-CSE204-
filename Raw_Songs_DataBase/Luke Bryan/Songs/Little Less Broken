Of all the bars you could've walked your boots into
Why'd it have to be the one that I picked too?
I just wanted a place to sip my way through, missin' you
You didn't see me when you walked past me
I wasn't ready to see you this happy

Looks like I'm movin' just a little less on with this
Looks like your world has got a little less wrong with it
Looks like it took you just a little less time
Looks like your heart's just a little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine

To hell with killin' what's left of this Walker Black
'Cause I ain't lettin' you know that I hurt this bad
I'll just hang my head underneath this hat, and slip out the back
I'm dealin' with not being together
So are you but you're doin' it better

It looks like I'm movin' just a little less on with this
Looks like your world has got a little less wrong with it
Looks like it took you just a little less time
Looks like your heart's just a little less broken than mine
Maybe goodbye didn't hit you the way that it hit me
Guess hearts don't ever break 50/50
Oh, 'cause it

Looks like I'm movin' just a little less on with this
Looks like your world has got a little less wrong with it
Looks like it's takin' me a little more time
'Cause baby your heart's just a little less broken, a little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine

A little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine...
