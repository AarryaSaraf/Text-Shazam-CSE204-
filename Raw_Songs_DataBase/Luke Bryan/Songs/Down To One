We were counting one star at a time
One fell out of the sky
You had your eyes closed, you were wishing on 'em
I was thinking 'bout your lips, girl and kissin' on 'em
We were sitting in the light of the moon
I was watching it shine on you
Funny how time flies with a good girl
On a good night

We were down to 1AM
Listening to one more song
Thinking I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light in the back of that two-tone, half-ton
My heart was telling me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight falling in love
Right there that night
Down to one

Said, we leave in one more minute
One passed by but we didn't
'Cause you were looking like a dream I'd been dreaming
I was thinking about anything but leaving
Still feel that touch
You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love
Never been that far

Down to 1 AM
Listening to one more song
Thinking I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light in the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was telling me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight falling in love
Right there that night
Down to one

I was saying, stay with me
I'll be everything you need

We were way past 1 AM
Listening to one more song
Thinking I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light in the back of that two-tone half-ton
My heart was telling me that one more kiss and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight falling in love
Right there that night
Down to one

Down to one
I was saying, stay with me
I'll be everything you need
Down to one, down to one
