Put in this morning at first light
Had a biscuit on my way down
I was sittin' there waitin' on the first bite
From a rainbow or a brown

Anchor down at the bridge, gonna try a new midge
There was traffic flyin' by
Taillights glowin' red, thirty feet overhead
But it felt like a thousand miles

I'm just floatin' this creek and takin' it slow
Tryin' to catch somethin' big, sip somethin' cold
I'd be a liar if I said I had a plan today

'Cept watch these banks roll by, take it on in
Don't get too deep, don't forget where I been
Nothin' but time to see where it takes me
Floatin' this creek

That rush hour traffic kinda slowed down
'Bout the time that the fish did too
Just me and this ol' green boat now
Nothin' but nothin' to do

So I broke out a cold one, called my buddies, told 'em
Slipped up and caught a state record
That's a little white lie, he was good eatin' size
But I like my story better

I'm just floatin' this creek and takin' it slow
Tryin' to catch somethin' big and sip somethin' cold
I'd be a liar if I said I had a plan today

'Cept watch these banks roll by, take it all in
Don't get too deep, don't forget where I been
Nothin' but time to see where it takes me
Yeah, I'm just floatin' this creek

Put my boat back on the trailer, eased out on the blacktop
Kinda sucks but I gotta make a dollar
I'm feeling pretty good, so I won't bitch
'Cause in the morning when I'm diggin' that ditch

I'll be floatin' this creek and taking it slow
Tryin' to catch somethin' big and sip somethin' cold
I'd be a liar if I said I had a plan today

'Cept watch these banks roll by, take it all in
Don't get too deep, don't forget where I been
Nothin' but time to see where it takes me
Floatin' this creek

Floatin' this creek
