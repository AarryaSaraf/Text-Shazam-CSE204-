I'm walkin' down the street, shufflin' my feet
Whistling a feel good song
Got the sun on my face, nothin' in my way
So I keep rockin' along


I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floating on a breeze
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me

The people downtown are hustlin' around
The weight of the world on their mind
Me I'm sittin' in the shade soakin' up the day
Watchin' 'em all roll by


I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floating on a breeze
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me

I like it laid back like a baby blue Cadillac
Easing on down the road
I like it nice and slow layin' low
Rolling anywhere the wind may blow


I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floating on a breeze
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me

I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floating on a breeze
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me
Don't you worry

I'm just doin' my thing
