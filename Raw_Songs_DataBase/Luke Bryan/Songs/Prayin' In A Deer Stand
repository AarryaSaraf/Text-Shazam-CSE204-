I think I read somewhere in the Good Book, says He's everywhere
Up in this tree with the wind and the leaves, yeah, it all seems so clear
When your phones in the truck, and you're camo'd up, and your mind's just running free
It might look like hunting, but it's way more than that to me

I do my prayin' in a deer stand
On my back forty church
Thinkin' about life on a cold sunrise
Yeah, that's my heaven on earth
Me and God in a cornfield
Gotta think He understands
I might miss a Sunday from time to time
But I get there when I can
We're all good in these woods
'Cause here I am, prayin' in a deer stand

Some find it on a pier where they used to fish with their old man
Some feel it when the choir sings and that light hits that stained glass
We're all down here searching for an answer or a sign
The way those clouds are moving in, I think He's hearing me just fine

I do my prayin' in a deer stand
On my back forty church
Thinkin' about life on a cold sunrise
Yeah, that's my heaven on earth
Me and God in a cornfield
Gotta think He understands
I might miss a Sunday from time to time
But I get there when I can
We're all good in these woods
'Cause here I am, prayin' in a deer stand
Prayin' in a deer stand

My boots back on the ground, my head back right
You got your ways of getting through, I got mine

I do my prayin' in a deer stand
Out on my back forty church
Thinkin' about life on a cold sunrise
Yeah, that's my heaven on earth
Me and God in a cornfield
Gotta think He understands
I might miss a Sunday from time to time
But I get there when I can
We're all good in these woods
'Cause here I am, prayin' in a deer stand
Prayin' in a deer stand
