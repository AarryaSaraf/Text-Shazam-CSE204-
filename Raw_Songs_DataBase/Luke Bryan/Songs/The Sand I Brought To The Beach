Real sad story here y'all
Come on

I poured her into my ride
And we rode down here
Maybe some sun, maybe some quality time
We've had a rocky year
She wasn't ready for me jumping on the bar
And buying everybody them shots
While I was burning up my credit card
She was burning tires out in the parking lot

I think I just lost the sand I brought to the beach
I guess she didn't like the Spring Break side of me
Now I'm rolling with my boys for the rest of the week
Somebody drink one with me
Ohh, 'cause I just lost the sand I brought to the beach

Oh well looks like I've done it again
I ran another one off
Maybe I'm better off a single man
At least down here Panama City

Now that I'm free for the rest of the week
Feel free to tag alone
Whatever y'all need, yeah
It's on me
So, here's to me doing whatever the hell I want

'Cause I just lost the sand I brought to the beach
I guess she didn't like the Spring Break side of me
Now I'm rolling with my boys for the rest of the week
Y'all drink one with me
Oh, 'cause I just lost the sand I brought to the beach

I just lost the sand I brought to the beach
I guess I can't control the Spring Break side of me
A ride home from my boys now is all I need

'Cause I just lost the sand I brought to the
Yeah I lost the sand I brought to the
Yes I've lost the sand I brought to the beach
