Old boat, new boat
Red boat, blue boat
Only thing better than one is two boats
Big church, small church
Come one, come all church

New sound, old sound
Small town, old town
If you're drinking, better have enough for the whole town
Red dirt, clay dirt
Trying to get to paydirt

Country did as country does
Long as the salt gets licked, and the corn grows thick and the sun comes up
Country is as country was
And 'round here, the good old days ain't far away, 'cause they can't change us
Proud of your family, proud of your name
Proud of the mud running through your veins
They say nothing don't ever stay the way it was
But country does
Country does

Old folks, kinfolks
Those folks, them folks
Talk about us, gonna take it on the chin folks
Farm work, hard work
Kids do the yardwork

Slow song, sad song
Growing up on dad's songs
Long as there's fiddle, hell, there really ain't a bad song
Cold beer, cheap beer
Plant our roots and our boots and our feet here

Country did as country does
Long as the salt gets licked, and the corn grows thick and the sun comes up
Country is as country was
And 'round here, the good old days ain't far away, 'cause you can't change us
Proud of your family, proud of your name
Proud of the mud running through your veins
They say nothing don't ever stay the way it was
But country does
Country does

Country did as country does
Long as the salt gets licked, and the corn grows thick and the sun comes up
Country is as country was
And 'round here, the good old days ain't far away, 'cause they can't change us
Proud of your family, proud of your name
Proud of the mud running through your veins
They say nothing don't ever stay the way it was
But country does
Country does, yeah

Country does

Proud of your family
Proud of your name
Proud of the mud running through your veins
Proud of your family
Proud of your name
Proud of the mud running through your veins...
