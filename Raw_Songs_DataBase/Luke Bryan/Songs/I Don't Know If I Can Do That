I'm not supposed to wanna love you no more
No more cards and flowers, no more knocks on your door
Just forget the perfect love that we had, but I don't know if I can do that
I was so certain baby you were the one, that this was it and all my searchin' was done
I should admit you're gone, get used to the facts
but I don't know if I can do that, I don't know if I can do that

I don't know how I'll ever let you go
Since you walked out, there's so much I don't know

The things I'm feelin' they just won't go away
I see you out and I don't know what to say
My friends all tell me that I oughta be glad
but I don't know if I can do that, I don't know if I can do that

I don't know how I'll ever let you go
Since you walked out, there's so much I don't
So much I don't know

Someday, somebody will really love me
And she'll be everything I thought you would be
And all I wanna do is love her back
But I don't know if I can do that, I don't know if I can do that
