Hey farm-boy, keep dropping that plow
Bailing that hay, feeding them cows
From the rooster crow till another long day is gone
Country on
Hey big rig, keep clocking them miles
Pulling that horn, making us smile
Rolling that load down the road all night long
Country on

Hey cowboy, keep slinging that rope
Eating that dirt, wearing that gold
Break a leg rodeo, but just don't break no bones
Country on
Hey barkeep, how 'bout another round?
Keep the neon lit in this crazy town
Just pour a little more
Country on

Country on
Yeah
Country on

Hey fireman, boys and girls in blue
We could sure use a lot more like you
You come running in anytime anything goes wrong
Country on
Hey soldier, wherever you might be
Hats off to keeping us free
All our thoughts and prayers till you get back home
Country on

Hey hometown, keep throwing that ball
Raise 'em outside, hang a fish on the wall
They only stay little so long, so love 'em up strong
Country on
I say hey, hey USA
We ain't seen our better days
Hell naw, hey y'all
Country on
Country on

Hey Nashville, keep bending them strings
Digging for gold, chasing them dreams
Keep on with your songs till the whole world's singing along
Country on
I say hey, hey USA
We ain't seen our better days
Hell naw, hey y'all
Country on

Country on and on and on and on and on
Country on and on and on
Country on (Oh, country on)
Keep keeping on and on and on and on and on
Country on and on and on
Country on

Yeah, country on
Woo
Yeah, country on and on and on
On and on
Keep putting that country on
Country on
Country on and on and on and on and on
Country on and on and on
Country on
