Lost in the sauce and that sauce is yours
I double dipped
I got no facade, I can't change the course
A titanic lost, if we lose this vibe
I'm no Randy Moss, but I'll catch ya feels one day
Smoking trees I planted
Smoke in peace, she painted
Lost in the sauce

I find myself in all your crevices
Heaven sent, don't gotta wonder why you levitate
It's evident your pull is actually gravitational
When I switch up, pray you pick up on this gravitas
My tongue will twist my heart a kamikaze
I make these statements 'cause they bona fide
Won't blow my high, but damn consistently I'm blown away
Flow shit your way, whole time I'm tryna have you flewed out
Bump Ella Mai, I see us boo'd up
She stole my soul must be in blue suede shoes
I'm in her Kool-Aid, she got the juice, I call her Kool G
Don't leave the crib we catching blu-rays
Blend it well we sipped a smoothie
King, it's just a Tuesday
Won't hesitate I'm sure as Al B
By her side or in her shadows, that's where I'll be

Lost in the sauce, and that sauce is yours
I double dipped
You know consistently I'm blown away (away away away)
You got me good
You got me gone
Wasn't even smoking stoned
Wasn't even smoking strong

Lost in the sauce, and that sauce is yours
I double dipped
You know consistently I'm blown away (away away away)
I got no facade, can't change the course
A titanic lost, if we lose this vibe
I'm no Randy Moss, but I'll catch ya feels one day
Flag on the play I'm moving on?

Lost in the sauce
