I just wanna smoke my weed
I just wanna love my girl
I just wanna smoke my weed
I just wanna love my girl
I just wanna praise my God
I just wanna sell my loose cigarettes
Nigga I just wanna do my job
Might wanna go for a jog
Might wanna sleep in my car
Might wanna sleep in my bed
Make me wanna bear my arms
Make me want the police dead
I really just want respect
I just wanna drink my drank
I just wanna fuck with my friends
Might wanna stack my ends
I wanna cross the street
I just wanna speed one time
I wanna do VIP one time
I just wanna speak my mind
I just wanna post my bail
I ain't even do the crime
I just wanna make mistakes
Might wanna ask a question
Might call the police for protection
Might wanna protect myself
I just wanna help myself
I might need meds myself
Just one caretaker to tell you I'm sick if I can't take care of myself

I just wanna live my life
Let me stay black and die
I just wanna live my life
I just wanna live my life
I just wanna smoke my weed
I just wanna love my girl
I just wanna praise my God
I just wanna sell my loose cigarettes
Nigga I just wanna do my job
I just wanna live my life

Just wanna smoke my weed and love my girl
Just wanna  and mind my business
Just wanna link up with the fam
Wanna live my life
Wanna live my life
Wanna hit the pool (yea)
Wanna hit the ice (yea)
Wanna jump the broom (yea)
Wanna throw a lil rice (yea)
Wouldn't that be nice (yea)
Just wanna smoke my weed and love my girl
