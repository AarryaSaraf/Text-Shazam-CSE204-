Niggas wanna see me stunt
Niggas wanna see me talk my shit
Niggas wanna see me front
Niggs wanna see me flaunt my bitch

Ohh niggas wanna see me stunt
Niggas wanna see my talk my shit
Niggas wanna see my Front, on em

Spent 20 mins on the face lips mac'd up oh these bitches better know I'm dicking that down on the regular
Move the fuck around you a regular to me don't act up niggas talk loud out the jugular
Keep my head down out in public and I'm aced in the club
