They say money can't make you happy
Well I beg to differ, I beg to differ

Straight from the mud
But the aim is to sleep like presidents
Come count my momma bills
And you gon' get relevance
Double the hussle, fuck a puzzle
Fuck the starve, this shit is muscles
Need a shovel
Let me show what a blessing is
This shit won't fall from the tress
Hold the torch, got the keys
I need my paper in peace
I like my Mac with the cheese
I need my mans to be free
Life tastes better with some ice to the tea
Fuck a slice, add a cherry, if you bake it for me
Thirsty for water, surrounded by desert eagles
Need to eat, pull the root out, fuck you talking bout evil?
The new pursuit of happiness
Nigga this the sequel
Changed the floor with a kingsizebed
Come let me teach you
Days without a heater
I was bleeding through these speakers
Plus I gotta feed a baby luck ain't never really reached us
Know these gone bill really keep us
Safe from the coldest nights, the older life
Nigga I ain't going back, fuck you talking wrong or right?

They say money can't make you happy
Well I beg to differ, I beg to differ
Started getting some change my perspective has changed
Nigga I beg to differ

Tell 'em put that shit where they mouth is
Order your house, fore you start talkin' that fresh shit
We ain't spittin' up mouthwash, we don't need too much vouchin'
Dragons hittin' on my tigers crouch and niggas is low key
That don't mean we ain't pouncin'
Break a pound to the ounces, niggas off of the gram

Get the game of the blouses
Lay in den linens in a Spanish brand I keep mispronouncin'
Think it's Loewe or Loewe, got a show in nueve
And they gon' cash me out as soon as we are exit stage left
This the life that I live, don't miss the one that I left
Don't miss the things that I stressed over what's really distressed
Right up until we finessed, a humble bag, you might hear a brag or two
On point like a dagger - bee, see
How could you quantify advice for my quality of life when
You don't know my pain and dichotomy is strife like
Bill foods wouldn't make the bigger loads 'light' like
Green bags wouldn't have me lean back
Could've had that good food
Could've look like Fat Joe
Couldn't even dream back then
I say broke and think 'bout how I was extrem back then

They say money can't make you happy
Well I beg to differ, I beg to differ
Started getting some change my perspective has changed
Nigga I beg to differ
