It is No More Magical
It is No More Magical

Ever gripped the chalice
Wasn't gifted balance
Held shit steady wit my hands you can see it in the callous
See em speaking fallacy
I seen em bury talents
Behind the curtains fatasty too
They call it magic I don't
A beauty pageant of sorts
I could imagine of course
I took the road less traveled
Won't even track it for sport
This Coaching jacket legit
Me and my niggas a force
Most couldn't match our flame
A matchbook to a torch
A flap jack ina pan
We backflipped off the porch
The backdrops is the same
But each pictures distorted
I paint them shits while they snoring
I'm tryna shake em awake
But it look like they enjoy it

It is No More Magical
It is No More Magical

Third eye closed
Birds eye view
Hear what he say
Watch what he do

Third eye closed
Birds eye view
Hear what he say
Watch what he do
Can't trust a soul what I'm posed to do
Threw his ass 11 catch 22
I just wanna know who I'm gone run into
Can't tell who been woke and who is just now coming too
Bank tell me I'm broke I know which one running through
We gone get that government funding too
What the summer do
Blacken us
Short and long list of how they tracking us
Flipping ips like a spatulas
Catchin me I'm cooked
We be all outta bounds you can color me shook
Still shoot my shot shout a young devin book

It is No More Magical
It is No More Magical
