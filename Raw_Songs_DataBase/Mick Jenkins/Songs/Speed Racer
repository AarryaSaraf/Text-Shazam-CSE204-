We haven't kicked it in a while, I've been so low-key
We ain't got lifted in a while chasing after deep paper
Things got different after a while, tryna match your speed
We playing catch-up, I'm tryna catch-up
We haven't kicked it in a while, I've been so low-key
We ain't got lifted in a while chasing after deep paper
Things got different after a while, tryna match your speed
We playing catch-up, I'm tryna catch-up

I'm tryna take off, me and my migos
La familia, my flows they on Danny Trejo
Better get familiar, my mind state on kill these niggas
Tryna kill these niggas, know the grind, paper, feel me
Nigga you don't feel me nigga, I need stages and megaphones
I need money, no advance, fuck a mega loan
I'm skipping rocks that I swear used to be my stepping stones
I'm stepping light like I'm on ice so none of my lessons clone
Please do not hate me 'cause you less informed
Thought it was one of those no-weapons-formed situations
Caught implications of other, that's why I'm on your line
It's not as simple as you make time for what you make time
You know me well if we FaceTime

We haven't kicked it in a while, I've been so low-key
We ain't got lifted in a while chasing after deep paper
Things got different after a while, tryna match your speed
We playing catch-up, I'm tryna catch-up
We haven't kicked it in a while, I've been so low-key
We ain't got lifted in a while chasing after deep paper
Things got different after a while, tryna match your speed
We playing catch-up, I'm tryna catch-up
