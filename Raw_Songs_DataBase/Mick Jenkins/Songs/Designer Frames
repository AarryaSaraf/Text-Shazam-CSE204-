Thousand dollars Cazals, Fear of God on my feet
How I walk in his footsteps, ain't walk to the beat?
How I tell 'em I'm flat-footed but stay on my toes?
Peep the shit with my left eye and stay on my creep, they can't stand on my flows
Lotta heads in the clouds
We was bobbin' our heads to your style 'fore you was born
Niggas want us like, "Wow, I can't go for the fade"
'Less you talking 'bout the olive green tint on my shades
These thousand dollars Cazals, frame of mind is the same
I was blessed to know on some niggas who would study the game
Who would give me some game
And they swear a nigga changed 'cause he spendin' some change
But the closest to me know we ain't just 'posed to stay the same
I can give a fuck bein' frank, I be laughin' like I'm off the Novacane
Hold the weight of the team
I might have to do like Kap or grab a cane
All the pain we ascertain from chocolate rain and acid rain, I need the sunshine
I bought these glasses, tryna rock 'em for the one time
The climate changed in December, feel like the summertime
The silence hangs in the air, the truth is underlined
Ain't no different through these thousand dollars Cazals
 in the clutch, another rack on my back
It's not to say you ain't up, but dawg I know you ain't up
These niggas off the caffeine, I only read in between
I mean I seen what I seen, these thousand dollars Cazals
Barely noticed the shade, I'm only playin' my hand
I mean a spade is a space, I flopped the nuts and I'm paid
Tell these neutered niggas, I ain't hearin' nothin' they say
Shit is deeper than rap, shit is deeper than skin
You'd see it if I was 
You get too deep with the pen and start sayin', "Behave"
I'm in too deep, no Cool J
Don't want 'em callin' me God, I can't keep up with the 
Nigga I'm just a man, Louis pouch in my hand
 there's parmesan in my pockets
I know the jacket was lamb and I got the top from Japan
Harmonizing with wifey, yeah, that was always the plan
And I see it happening through thousand dollars Cazals
