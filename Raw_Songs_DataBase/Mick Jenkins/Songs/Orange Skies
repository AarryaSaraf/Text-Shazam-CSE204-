Politicians got me moving cutthroat
Scapegoating migrants into sunk boats
While they spend our taxes on
Some top coke
Chopping down our forests till we cough smoke
Add it up
Add it up
Cose their sum gross
They say African nations got corrupt laws
While they giving contracts to their uncles
Do they think we're stupid, yea they must do?
They won't change their ways until we bust through
I'm with my people and the bus full
Calling climate justice it's about time
Cose our black people on the front line
Ain't you seeing what I'm seeing
Hurricanes and fires blazing, flooding in Savannah basins
We were all indigenous until they slaved us
Time to break this shit up
Time to break this shit up

Yea yeaaa yeaaah
Look like either way it go I'm on
These greenhouse gases
Ain't no love below all reason seems outcasted
Couldn't clean house faster, couldn't reroute plastic
Now the sun coming for our caps
Less ice more water
None for our taps
Shooting craps with our crops now we losing seeds
Losing bees nigga
We gon' lose some recipes
Let earth rest in peace
Or watch her blow from the mezzanine
No magazines we don't see the issue
It might be too much shit to
Losing trees we won't notice until there ain't no tissue
This shit can't continue
But it just keep right on rolling keep them lights on I can't find one moment
Know the darkness right up on us I'ma need Patronus
Stick with my brothas like we Jonas told em they can't own us
They can't beat us
They can't join us
We can't lose our focus
Niggas look at science like this shit is hocus pocus

Orange skies all on my feed

Yea yea
Yea yea
Aye aye

If I let my mind have money rule
I woulda quit stedda rhyming truths
They got our people by the wombs
They got our people by the balls
Left stroke coming, it's
Time to move
(If the) left stroke come it's time to
Move on the world entitled
My bredda it true we're lied to
Better move your health to ital
Belief in science is vital
Educate yourself from an expert
Who do you see when your leg hurt?
Better yet your kid
Or a relative
Is not getting better sick
You take em to an expert doctor not a YouTube clip
So come on
(Aye)
Yes you should Question shit
But that's science
But when you tell people not to question, thats signs...
(Yea that's signs)
Not saying that's
Lies but read between lines
(Tween lines)
They would love keep you ignorant fine
Calling Toussaint
Revolution
A mec! Nous retournons
I'm calling beacoup on their bullshit for too long
Ain't no planet B
For us to move on
