What they make us have face
Riskin' myself, my life, my woman, my sister, my children
On some idealism that you assure me is in America
That I have never seen
Oh, it got 'em feelin' a way

Chain smokin', rollin' back to back
Train ago, no holdin' back the pack
Them gangster quotes you spoke, can't take them back
They ain't supposed to know shit, that's a fact
Divided by the quotation, that's the truth
Lost patience and some more shit, what it do
Wasted time, I'm focused on the future
Planted seeds, I'm tryna grow some 
Manatees around you, I go deeper
Fantasies around you, I'm a truther
Luther, never too much, it's a booster
Rap cap calm, niggas froze, no Medusa
We ain't here to marvel at the hoes and
We ain't finna gravel at the motherfuckin' toes 'cause he super
Only given code to 'em, fuck if they use to
Nigga be denyin' the abuse they allude
I refuse to believe in the booth
I'm like Eminem, a nigga needed a proof
I didn't need a ceilin', but I needed a roof
Need some penicillin, niggas sick with the lies
Shit thick in disguise, know I needed the truth

Know it got 'em feelin' a way
Know it got 'em feelin' a way, way
I don't never speak too lose
Heard they like to keep two truths and a lie
I don't think I can trust in the troops
Know it got 'em feelin' a way

Look
I know you can't heal in a day
Know it's too much real in the way
Soon as we touch down, cotton field's in the way
Know it got 'em feelin' a way, way
I know this shit still here today
Stay on point, that's a spearheaded way
Flow like water, we'll never liquidate
Metal Gear Solid, they appear with the snakes
No way (No way)
No way (No way)
No way (No way)
No way, no way, no way
Know it got 'em feelin' a way
No way (No way)

Divided by the quotation, that's the truth
