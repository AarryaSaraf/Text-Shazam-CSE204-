Yeah, uh

Moving with emotion, no force
Wavy like the ocean, of course
Who gave you the notion, I couldn't roll on my own
Had to hop off the wave, learning to float on my own
Copped the boat on my own, verse that I wrote on my own

Just know a nigga place is low-key
No cash or bank statements on me
Good dank, I got it from the homies
No ring get pulled, I call 'em OG's
Know that they cold, live by a code
I feel it different when, living a different way
That's how it goes, that's how it goes
But I know my shit is gold, yeah
I know my shit is gold

I was locked up, ate all my feelings like cheese
I was blocked up, had to start opening things
I would not touch, had to acknowledge some dreams
I could not sleep, had to be seen on , I could not creep
Had to be Aries, Elise, I am not sheep
Shit that I carried for years finally got me
Shit that I carried for years finally got me

That's why I'm moving with emotion, no force
Wavy like the ocean, of course
Who gave you the notion, I couldn't roll on my own
Had to hop off the wave, learning to float on my own
Copped the boat on my own, verse that I wrote on my own
