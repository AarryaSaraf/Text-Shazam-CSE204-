I played the fool, removed the wool
Over my eyes, I wiped the drool
I was sleep... I was sleep

I like my coffee black as all her favorite movies
Never going back to jail, I say that loosely
Before the handcuffs, they'll probably shoot me
I'm taking it back to '67 sped off in a two door
My notebook got me extra loose leaf
I'm in a function, fifteen minutes, then I chuck the deuces
Keep it raw, I'm on a roll, no sushi
Had to wrap my green and black, that avocado maki
The Parmesan will have you thinking that it's time to Bruce Lee
But I am no Goofy, hell my horses niggas love to jockey
Flows too cold, needs no Zamboni, we already polished
We know the phonies using makeup and they switching stylists
Held up attacking, these niggas childish
We need them truly, call the academy, he acting all of that emotion
I call my shorty, she the only one who knew me

I played the fool, removed the wool
Over my eyes, I wiped the drool
I was sleep... I was sleep
I was sleeping

Deep in REM, I swear this shit the matrix
Like he fresh up outta coma, or relearning basics
I used to think my shit didn't stink because it smelled so different
I guess it's kinda like when racists swear that they're not racist
I'm owning up, I'm doing work, I'm not gon' play it down
These days can't knock me off my square, I'm not gon' play around
Felon locked two damn niggas hate the sound
Grinding up the jack hammer, niggas breaking ground
When I see flows, heard a joint from muscle memory, need a icy hot
6 a.m., I'm on Twitter with a spicy taste
This shit take time, you couldn't change that with an icy watch
For a fashionable nigga, I was high key late
Ricki Lake, I had to lose some fucking weight, I did
Once I woke up, all my dreams became some great ideas
Then ideas just as quickly became some shit I did
You talking jokes, you think I did this shit to say I did
Say I did, never see 'em walking what they talk
Thousand words later, no Gordon Parks
In the deeper parts of water where it's more dark

I played the fool, removed the wool
Over my eyes, I wiped the drool
I was sleep... I was sleep
I was sleeping
I played the fool, removed the wool
Over my eyes
I was...
