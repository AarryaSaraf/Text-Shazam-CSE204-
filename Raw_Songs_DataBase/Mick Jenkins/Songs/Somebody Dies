There's no way to take me alive
See it from the front and I fuck from the side
Sick of the lust and tired of the lies
But fuck with my girl and then somebody dies
There's no way to take me alive
Tired of the tears so dry off your eyes
Sick of the lust and tired of the lies
But fuck with my blood and then somebody dies

Aye
Aye, she gon' ride
Gon' have to catch us if you can
Gon' have to match me if you smoke
Gon' step out like I'm Dapper Dan
I mean, thousand thread count shawty
Prolly why these niggas sleeping on the floor
I mean, I don't need to sneak about it
I don't even think about it, I just go
I mean, fuck I need to call the bros for?
Need to call to get a pedicure the way a nigga stand ten toes though
I could make it all ever clear
I ain't got to bring a hundred proofs to you
I just try to bring the truth to you
Real ones ain't no use to you
Y'all ain't ever got to news for me
Fuck
Ugh

Trippin' bout how you gripping Smith &'s and this and that, that's a lie
Kickin' back eating chicken backs with some fries
I deny any claims that my city bangs
But if I had to claim in these sides,
I'd make my name the gang so when you say my name you'd bang mine
Infrared on your head I aim wise
When my lead it spread I take lives
All because you tried to take mine
Fuck with mine and then somebody dies
Flatline

There's no way to take me alive
See it from the front and I fuck from the side
Sick of the lust and tired of the lies
But fuck with my girl and then somebody dies
There's no way to take me alive
Tired of the tears so dry off your eyes
Sick of the lust and tired of the lies
But fuck with my blood and then somebody dies

I want to fix all the things that I've broken
I want the merciful touch of the omen
Sick of the mundane flow of the motions
I don't cover no more bitches in lotions
Nah
Keep one of them chicks and I love her to death
With every new day, death creeps in my breath
I'm running my clock and there ain't much left
High stress my heart might beat out my chest
Done with the poison I weed out the rest
Love was appointed it beat out the sex
Trust is avoided I prenup the rest
Man, fuck with the opiates, flush out my flesh
I'ma breath in slow then I feel that I'm blessed
I'ma bleed out more in the dead of the den
Thrown to the wolves and I'm back with a vengeance

There's no way to take me alive
See it from the front and I fuck from the side
Sick of the lust and tired of the lies
But fuck with my girl and then somebody dies
There's no way to take me alive
Tired of the tears so dry off your eyes
Sick of the lust and tired of the lies
But fuck with my blood and then somebody dies
