I was trippin'
I was definitely trippin' now that I think back
I was bitter
No matter how I shoot, I'll never win it all
On my own, yeah, without you (Without you)
It's the same thing for me
I was trippin'

I was just used to that shit
It's like suicides at the practice, I was conditioned this way
You a brand new conditioner
Didn't realize that I was auditionin' though
Bring all of your big ambitions this way
Don't tell me no lies, I'm learnin' I'm missin' it, huh
You should recognize a nigga is different this way
Let's randomize, and way more intentional now
Goes all the way down to your hips and the distance they sway
I got the mirage and kissin' the lip-gloss you use
I count up the freckles and all of the dips in your face
Nothing can touch that joy
Bit of better of your feet
I always sleep at your place

I been trippin'
I was definitely trippin' now that I think back
I was blue, I was crippin'
I was trippin'
No matter how I shoot, I'll never win it all
On my own, yeah, without you (Without you)
It's the same thing for me

You wouldn't entice the young man
Your voice was nearly enough to suffice at that time
That isn't likely these days
You know what I mean, we sacrifice for this love
I know for sure it's not overprized over her
And that's not to say it wasn't expensive as fuck
That's not to say we didn't roll a dice over here
Scratchin' our head, it wasn't no lice
Just real life committed to her, all of her vices would clear
She committed to me despite the advices we heard
We thought it was sweet, it's not over wives over here
Feel like a mail bird, a pepper dice for a year
Still we throwin' rights over here
We both have walls up so high
Reachin' new heights over here

I been tripping
I was definitely tripping now that I think about it
With the crew, I was different
Eyes were red
I was bitching
Bullshittin
No matter how hard I shoot
I will never win it all, on my own, without you
