I keep dripping over these flows
I keep the stiff arm, you too close
Swiss army knife I keep like seven different type of bros
At least two keep a pole
At least 3 from the streets
I know Five live by the code
Savages in the fold
Halogens on bright, y'all know slime heavy with the smoke
Grind heavy tony hawk
Hands on, do it manual more  in my walk
Kick push all the hoes, no Fiascos I'm Spock
No tobacco just weed
Too much Tabasco, I'm hot
This shit is Hasbro, all games
I cannot dap up no opps
I keep a stiff arm, don't tweak
I hit the heisman on beat

I keep rolling up I just smoked
Fact is some niggas just weeds
Fact is some niggas gon' grow
Fact is some you don't need
I keep the stiff arm, you too close
Too many hands on this blunt, too many
Too many words left unsaid
Too many times left on read
Too many times watched you front, too many
Too many hands on this blunt

It's too many people I don't know
Too many hands in my face, in my pocket
Shit gets out of pocket
You gotta watch it
You gon' learn this shit
If I only had my left eye I might burn this shit
I digress, it's only sage and this is burning shit

And it's too many heads in this bitch, boy
It's too many heads on this blunt, too many
Too many heads on this blunt, too many
I keep a stiff arm, you too close
I keep a swiss army knife too
(I keep a stiff arm, you too close)
(I keep a swiss army knife too)
(I keep a swiss army knife)


A few thousand pounds of what the fuck now
Y'all scared we gonna pick up the pace and trample our way out
Y'all gonna make us pop the trunk and trample the whole town
Unstoppable together so we plucked from the crowd
The hot topic tossed around that no one talks about
A 10 feet tall issue in plain view
Our existence is the elephant in every board room
How we larger than life and lurking in the shadow?
How the lion the king when I can slap him with my nose?
Take our plant base for weakness
Stay preying on our soul
Bring up what y'all did to us and now the schools uncomfortable
Y'all can ban critical race theory but it's the bedrock of your homes
We easier to muzzle when we made to feel alone
A huge burden when you way too much
Thick skin with a sensitive touch
Can't shrink, don't mean it don't hurt
Enormity, it's a gift and curse
We gon' wait for recognition or flip the conference table first
Their fear or ours, ain't no telling what's worse
