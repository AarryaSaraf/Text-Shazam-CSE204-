Need no convincing niggas know the feelings
Stand on my own ten need no co-defendants
Don't Need no inconsistencies if we gon roll together
Need no convincing niggas know the feelings
Not too much patience for the violations
From the same cloth It cut much deeper when it's my persuasion
Depend on when and where you asking me my occupation
Acknowledge haters always working how you knock a nigga
Betty crocker in the oven I can't wait that long
I'm gon wait that long I know somebody know the feeling
We did the floors we did the walls I do not want a ceiling
I want what's come to me and they gon try to cap the building
We got some spillage they won't pillage
I play Cappadonna
Big Daddy Kane ain't no half steppin with this black Madonna
Extract the charmer made some commas off my pain and suffering
The same ones round me been the bros since no was on the bluff
They know what's up
Need no convincing niggas know the feelings
Stand on my own ten need no co-defendants
Don't Need no inconsistencies if we gon roll together
Need no convincing niggas know the feelings
Need no convincing niggas know
