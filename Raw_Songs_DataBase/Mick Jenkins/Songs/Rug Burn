Uh!
Niggas sleep on the flow
Niggas sleep on the flow
Like their cousins stayed over the weekend
Real niggas know
Real bitches quote

Got no time to complain
I'm just tryna maintain
Ain't really tryna explain, why my streaming ain't main my nigga
Little did you know
But all my real niggas know
Yea my real niggas know
When they see me they live
They be like Mick you top five
I be like nigga, I know
I like to keep it a buck
I used to keep it like eighty
I hope you feeling my growth
Still niggas sleep on the flow
Niggas sleep on the flow and don't smell the feet in their face
One by the head and the toe
Sweat for the bread with no yeast
I had the croissants and sweets
Seen niggas beg for the dough
Seen mamas knead the whole week
Seen butter melt on the biscuit as father's head for the door
I got the bread when he loaf
Had run ins with some prosciutto I gave em mirrors and smoke
And now I'm here with my toast
Finna bust at the sky and make shit they hear if they woke
I know the real ones a quote
I know my real niggas know

Niggas sleep on the flow
Niggas sleep on the flow like can I just crash at your crib for a few, got nowhere to go

Real niggas know 
Real niggas know 


I ain't gotta say shit
I ain't gotta make a list
I ain't even gotta trip when they skip acknowledgment
Kept a chip on a nigga shoulder and his pockets thick

Real niggas know 
Real niggas know
