Ey, pardon my intrusion
Been hardened by illusion
They've been lying to us
Please, pardon my confusion
I was blind to it
Seems my strings still needed fine tuning
Soiled and now I'm blooming
Let you see that I'm human
Riddled with flaws
But never bear false witness at all
They showed the climb and never mentioned the fall
When deposits start to slow
And you still too quick with withdraws
Sometimes the vision get too long to get solved
With my resolve
Probably spin the block until I evolve
It's time, entry all the doors are revolving
All this noise is revealing
All my choices appealing
I like the ones with no sentence
Didn't have no phone, knew my calling
Most niggas won't know the feeling
Some niggas don't know they hurting
How they know
How they gon' know they need healing
He only know what he heard
He only know what he seen
He try to speak on the both
He end up somewhere between
Nobody else coming close

Nah, nobody else finna ride
But what you fighting inside
Do the best they can by your side
That's just not where shit resides
Nobody else coming close

You say you know what you want
But is what you want what you need
Feels like you missing a piece
Maybe what's missing is me

You say you know what you want
But is what you want what you need
Feels like you missing a piece
Maybe what's missing is me

Your body get comatose
Shit hit like Albert Pujols
Until you lose his new growth
You felt that shit now you know
Tender headed for sure
I used to pull at my curls
It kept my head to the floor
I used to chase after girls
It kept my hands on the door
I used to change for the world
I ain't do that shit no more
Really be on my me shit
Ain't bending over backwards no more
I got the secret all these actors don't know
I just ain't acting more more
I just retracted all the factors
If there ain't no magic, let go
If that ain't felt nobody else coming close
