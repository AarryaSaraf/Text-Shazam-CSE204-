Pulled up in the vintage thang
Checked the rearview through the vintage frames
That's just gang behind me
Dirty niggas no stains behind me
Freenation no ball and chain
A few niggas that came with slime are what niggas might call insane
They like callin bluffs
I won't call it game if a nigga can't play when we call the refs
Can't state the stats debating facts without the effort
Blatant act like Golden State without the Steph
The glue ain't right the ankle shake the shoe ain't right
I do it well I manifest the blue and white
I'm too legit I'm doing it right
Still they hate so
That don't mean I make it through the night

We been building Isosceles
Conduct like apostrophes
And you know we need the acknowledgement
You can't talk shit with apologies at the end of your sentences
Concentrate, the truth can't kinda be
I'm looking for kindred folk
I'm finding my folk all like anaconda be

Snakes in the grass
Snakes on the plane
Snakes for your master
Just one in the same
Snakes in the grass
Snakes on the plane
Snakes for your master

Snakes only wanna tip the scales when your pockets heavy
I remember days piece of mind coming secondary to this peace of mine
Gotta hold it steady gotta concentrate
I been planting seeds water working 'til the levee break
I know seasons change and the tall grass make the serpents deadly til they penetrarte
If I tell it I can pen a book
You can come to London baby take a look
I know real drillers I know real niggas
We don't feel niggas know we got em shook
Same bruddas that will smile with you
Quick to put the pistol to your pearly whites
Keep my circle tight like numb pussy
Just a couple brothers ain't none pussy

Maybe it's sorcery
Conduct like apostrophe
I need me some accolades
If I'm speaking honestly
I need me a couple plugs
Just check my discography
They don't want no parts of me
I'm shedding my skin just like anacondas be

Snakes in the grass
Snakes on the plane
Snakes for your master
Just one in the same
Snakes in the grass
Snakes on the plane
Snakes for your master
