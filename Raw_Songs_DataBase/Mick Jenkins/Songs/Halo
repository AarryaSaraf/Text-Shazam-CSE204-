Come from a higher place
Come from a higher place

Don't worry 'bout nothing, I'll place a halo
Don't get caught in the shower, you gon' come out alive
Don't worry 'bout nothing, I'll place a halo
Don't get caught in the shower, you gon' come out alive

Thought I had it all in a bag, thought I had it all in a plan
More like twist and turn when the flow would bend
I feel like I'm 'bout to flip in that whip switch hands
And I can only help myself, hope you understand

It's that light shit, it's that overnight
It's that light shit, spark or lose your mind

I treat Brooklyn like Bethlehem
Bridgetown is Nazareth
They wanna send me Jerusalem
But I'm on some other shit
Cash on that Methuselah
Shawty she servin' Medusa looks
You claim that you damaged, there's two of us
So hope I can bandage your wound
Man, they can't handle the truth
Life is attached to the tomb
Tapped in but I'm trapped in the coupe
Strapped in but the ride was nice
Hit the club on a Friday night
Yeah the vibe was ight but I'd rather shoot
Kick a vibe in my avenue
I like the view from this altitude

It's that light shit, it's that overnight
It's that light shit, spark or lose your mind

I put the Gucci with the Fubu did the 
Out in paris stuck in traffic
Had to string the DJ  was clownin'
Then I put the crumble in the paper with the flower
We was smokin', we was breathing under water
We was drownin'
Started being honest with myself, the Henny nasty
Switched it for the dulce
Chase it with the agua
That's two cups, keep it classy
I only do the truth say
Put that on my momma, trust me I can feel the hate
I feel that fake ass energy these niggas seal they fate
They switch the style to match the scene on some chameleon shit
You catching me with silicon it's more Chamillionaire
We buildin' up, it's no more ceilings here

Don't worry 'bout nothing, I'll place a halo
Don't get caught in the shower, you gon' come out alive
Don't worry 'bout nothing, I'll place a halo
I'll place a halo, I'll place

It's that light shit, it's that overnight
It's that light shit, spark or lose your mind
