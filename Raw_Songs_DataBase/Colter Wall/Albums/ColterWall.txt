// Thirteen Silver Dollars //

It was a cold and cruel evening
Sneaking up on Speedy Creek
Found myself asleep and in the snow
One or two odd reasons
I ain't too proud to repeat
For now we'll say I had no place to go
There was a rustle and a humming
Just hauling down the street
I drew myself up from my icy bed
Painted on that shiny car the letters 'RCM and P'
I can feel a little aching in my head

And then out jumps this old boy
About twice the size of me
He asked me for my name and where I dwell
I just looked him in the eye
And sang 'Blue Yodel Number 9'
He didn't catch the reference, I could tell

Then the old, familiar click
In the handcuffs bind and grip
Should have left me in the snow, where I laid

He just laughed and touched his gun
And turned to me and he said
Son, I bet you don't own a damn thing
To your name

Well, I got my health
My John B Stetson
Got a bottle full of baby's bluebird wine
And I left my stash
Somewhere down in Preston
Along with thirteen silver dollars and my mind

Well, I got my health
My John B Stetson
Got me a bottle full of baby's bluebird wine
And I left my stash
Somewhere down in Preston
Along with thirteen silver dollars and my mind

// Codeine Dream //

Prayin' on the north wind
Lead me to my door
Thumbing through my green backs
Swearin' I made more
Some cruel nightly cycle
Leaves me cryin' on a motel floor
I don't cry for you
Anymore

Many a dark hour
I look up to the sky
Many unkind thoughts are laid
On my hazy eyes
Sometimes I get to thinkin'
Why wait around to die
I don't think of you
So I get by

Every day it seems
My whole damn life's just a codeine dream
I don't dream of you
Anymore

The sun is gone away now
Green grass turns to brown
Every December it gets a little bit harder
To lay that bottle down
It's more than just the weather
That plagues this prairie town
I won't be seeing you
When I come 'round

Every day it seems
My whole damn life's just a codeine dream
I don't dream of you
Anymore

// Me And Big Dave //

Me and a big Dave were just trying to stay upright
We were chasing white lines and warping our minds last night
We were killing the time though we sure didn't know it
Hunting down rhymes with a Kentucky poet
Me and big Dave were just trying to stay alive

There's some folks around town
That might cuss our names down to the floor
They might claim that were loners
No account stoners and more
It's the same kind of people claim to be chosen
Their ears made of stone and their tongues made of poison
The doctrine they preach has got nothing that they can teach me

Well I don't know if Dave hates the same kind of hate that I do
He knows that I know that he's been cut down by it too
Well people get talking 'bout things that we uses
I ain't in the business of making excuses
Me and big Dave were just trying to stay alive
This whole world's full of ghosts
That I believe that most folks can't see
The particular demons that reason with big Dave and me

// Motorcycle //

Well, I figure I'll buy me a motorcycle
Wrap her pretty little frame around a telephone pole
Ride her off a mountain like old Arlo
Figure I'll buy me a motorcycle

Well, I figure I'll walk to the liquor store
Thunderbird, two bottles
Maybe three, maybe four
Follow my feet down the Music Row

Pour it on the pavement like you would a tombstone
Like you would a tombstone
Like you would a tombstone
Pour it on the pavement like you would a tombstone

Well, I figure I'm weary of feeling this way
Pop another pill, hop another train
Tell my brothers and my sisters that it's keeping me sane
Figure I'm weary of feeling this way

Well, I figure I'll buy me a motorcycle
Wrap her pretty little frame around a telephone pole
Ride her off a mountain like old Arlo
Figure I'll buy me a motorcycle
Figure I'll buy me a motorcycle
Figure I'll buy me a motorcycle

// Kate McCannon //

Well the raven is a wicked bird
His wings are black as sin
And he floats outside my prison window
Mocking those within
And he sings to me real low
It's hell to where you go
For you did murder Kate McCannon

When I first met Tom McCannon
I was working in the mines
Said he had himself a dark haired daughter
With long, green eyes
When she and I did meet
She was bathing in the creek
Prettiest girl in the whole damn holler
That ain't no lie

So I went a courtin' Kate McCannon
Got me a job and I quit my ramblin'
And every day I'd save
A quarter of my pay
I could buy a diamond ring
Lord and one day I come home to find
My darlin' angel's not inside
So I made for the creek
Where she and I did meet
And found her with some other lover
And I put three rounds into Kate McCannon

// Snake Mountain Blues //

Mr. Ten Dollar Man
Let me tell where you're bound
Drink your green liquor
Lord, you roll to the ground
Well you come around here
With your money in your hand
Tasting my woman
Well you die where you stand

Well the Snake Mountain blues
Got me down low
I could die in the morning
Ain't no one would know
Well my woman she come around
My body she'd find
Go down in 'Dee
And have her a time

Well my daddy Lord he rides
On a long holy train
The first winds of winter
I see him again
And it's fare well
And it's yellow-headed misery I've known
Snake Mountain's calling, calling me home

Well the Snake Mountain blues
Got me down low
And I could die in the morning
Ain't no one would know
Well my woman she come around
My body she'd find
Go down in Dundee
And have her a time
Have her a time

// You Look To Yours //

I met a little girl in Saskatoon
She was beaming, bold and beautiful
And higher than the moon
Before I could profess she left too soon
The words she spoke were enough to make me blue
She said, I know just what you're wishing
Two folks in our condition
We'll never leave this bar room with our pride
So go about your earthly mission
Don't trust no politicians
You look to yours and I will look to mine

I met a Nashville honkytonkin' queen
And the caress of her amber lips
Was reserved for Jim Beam
Took her by the arm, she made a scene
Whiskey was yet to dull her tongue it seemed
She said, I know just what you're wishing
Two folks in our condition
We'll never leave this bar room with our pride
So go about your earthly mission
Don't trust no politicians
You look to yours and I will look to mine

Out west, by God, Virginia's where I'm bound
She's as wild, she's as wonderful
As any girl I've found
So keep me just as long as I'm around
I never have to hear that awful sound
Well I know just what you're wishing
Two folks in our condition
We never leave this bar room with our pride
So go about your earthly mission
Don't trust no politicians
You look to yours and I will look to mine
You look to yours and I will look to mine

// Transcendental Ramblin' Railroad Blues //

Lay me down easy
Lay me down hard
Light my cigarette and make my bed
Somewhere beneath the stars

I was born a blue child
Of the wild western sky
But I left my prairie home
Found a boxcar for to ride
Now I'm way down in Okema
Earning blisters on my feet
With my guitar and my buck knife
Thumbing down Woody Guthrie Street

So lay me down easy
Lay me down hard
Light my cigarette and make my bed
Somewhere beneath the stars
Don't look for me in glory
Don't look for me below
'Cause I'll be riding on that freight
Where the souls of ramblers go

And there's a sadness that follows
Most everywhere I roam
You can see it on my smile
You can smell it on my clothes
Sometimes I'll outrun it
It never lasts too long
So keep me good and loaded
And I'll keep singing songs

Lay me down easy
Lay me down hard
Light my cigarette and make my bed
Somewhere beneath the stars
Don't look for me in glory
Don't look for me below
'Cause I'll be riding on that freight
Where the souls of ramblers go

If I don't leave here tomorrow
I believe I'll blow out my brains
But either way there'll be sorrow
And you won't be seeing me again

Lay me down easy
Lay me down hard
Light my cigarette and make my bed
Somewhere beneath the stars
Don't look for me in glory
Don't look for me below
'Cause I'll be riding on that freight
Where the souls of ramblers go

// Fraulein //

Far across the deep blue water
Lives an old German's daughter
On the banks of the old river Rhine
There I loved her and left her
Now I can't forget her
She was my pretty fraulein

Fraulein, fraulein look up toward the heavens
Each night when them stars start to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty fraulein

When my memories wander away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
Her face comes before me
The face of my pretty fraulein

Fraulein, fraulein look up towards the heavens
Each night as the stars start to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty fraulein
You are my pretty fraulein

// Bald Butte //

Bald Butte, Bald Butte so lofty and so high
Carry me to Bald Butte
Where the plains wrap round the sky
You can dig a hole on Bald Butte when I die

Henry was born on Bald Butte
A paint horse he did ride
Well he roped him in Alberta
Broke him on the Montana line
Tore him a trail through the northwest countryside

Henry took to stealing
Robbing on the CP Rail
He got the devil on his shoulders
And the law man on his tail
You better ride, Henry ride
You ain't got no friends to go your bail

Well he rode across the Grey Back camp
Up in Cypress Hills
They said they left the US nation
On the day that Richmond fell
They whistled Dixie and set him up a still

Henry woke the next morn
Like a corpse from the grave
Half blind and twice as haggard
He took a cast iron to the brain
They stole his horse and the rifle that shared his name

And he tracked them former Johnny Rebs
Through the prairie and the trees
Up old Castle Mountain
Cross the river Wapiti
Low and behold, what do you think he sees
I see my paint
I see my rifle that shares my name
I see them men that done me wrong
Lord, I'm gonna do them just the same

Henry grabbed his rifle
Up off of the ground
He kissed the ever-loving barrel
And he shot them old boys down
They hit the dirt, he revelled in the sound

Now he's back up in the saddle
Back up on the top
When he felt that southern slug
Chew a hole right through his gut
He thought he killed them all
But he had not

That paint took off a running
Through the water and the mud
No earthly force in this whole world
Could stop that 'Berta stud
Henry sat there laughing up his blood

And he was singing
Bald Butte, Bald Butte so lofty and so high
Carry me to Bald Butte
Where the plains wrap round the the sky
You can dig a hole on Bald Butte when I die
