"Oh bury me not on the lone prairie"
These words came slow and mournfully
From the pallid lip of a youth who lay
In his dying bed at the close of day

"Oh bury me not...," and his voice failed there
But they took no heed to his dying prayer
In a narrow grave, just six-by-three
They buried him there on the lone prairie

"Oh bury me not on the lone prairie"
Where the owl of night hoots mournfully
And the blizzard beats and the winds blow free
O'er his lonely grave on the lone prairie

And the cowboys now as they roam the plain
For to marked the spot where his bones were lain
Fling a handful of roses o'er his grave
With a prayer to God for his soul to save
