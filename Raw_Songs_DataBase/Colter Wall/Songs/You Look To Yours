I met a little girl in Saskatoon
She was beaming, bold and beautiful
And higher than the moon
Before I could profess she left too soon
The words she spoke were enough to make me blue
She said, I know just what you're wishing
Two folks in our condition
We'll never leave this bar room with our pride
So go about your earthly mission
Don't trust no politicians
You look to yours and I will look to mine

I met a Nashville honkytonkin' queen
And the caress of her amber lips
Was reserved for Jim Beam
Took her by the arm, she made a scene
Whiskey was yet to dull her tongue it seemed
She said, I know just what you're wishing
Two folks in our condition
We'll never leave this bar room with our pride
So go about your earthly mission
Don't trust no politicians
You look to yours and I will look to mine

Out west, by God, Virginia's where I'm bound
She's as wild, she's as wonderful
As any girl I've found
So keep me just as long as I'm around
I never have to hear that awful sound
Well I know just what you're wishing
Two folks in our condition
We never leave this bar room with our pride
So go about your earthly mission
Don't trust no politicians
You look to yours and I will look to mine
You look to yours and I will look to mine
