I ride my horse cross the pasture
I jerk my catch twine down
I seen a cow and a sticker in her eye
And I bedded that old hide down
I bedded that old hide down

My horse he knew his business
And he held the rope just right
My dog he's circling round and round
As I pulled that sticker from her eye
Boy get back, I'm pulling a sticker from her eye, you booger

I noticed that she had a tight bag
Her calf nowhere to be found
I told my dog if you want something to do
Go find her calf, bring him back round
Go find her calf boy and bring him back round

He darted over the hillside and he went plum out of sight
When I looked up he was bringing back a calf
Put that calf by his momma's side
Go put that calf right by his momma's side

Well he'd been gone all night
Maybe for more than a day
So he got himself a belly full of milk
Put that calf and his momma on their way
Oh put that calf and his momma on their way

This day in the life of a cowboy
That old darn worlds out spinning round
Me and my dog made a happy reunion when we bedded that old hide down
When we bedded that old hide down
