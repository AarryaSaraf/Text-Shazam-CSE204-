Oh say, little dogies, why don't you lay down?
You've wandered and trampled all over the ground
Lay down, little dogies, lay down

I've cross-herded, circle-herded, trail-herded too
But to keep you together, that's what I can't do
Bunch up, little dogies, bunch up

My horse is leg-weary and I'm awful tired
But if I let you get away I'm sure to get fired
Bunch up, little dogies, bunch up
