Cows are in the corn
The feeds all rotten
A new day is born
An ol' one forgotten
The Lord and his plans
Many times I fought 'em
Raisin' cotton, cotton, cotton

For forty long years, I sweat
And I toiled
In the sun I've been seared
Like to wither or boil
I may well have faired better
Drillin' for oil
Raisin cotton, cotton, cotton

Boll weevils in the field
Got me down trodden
Raised hell on my yields
Nearin' rock bottom
Neighbors helpin' hand
Lord knows I wished I'd sought 'em
Raisin' cotton, cotton, cotton
Oh raisin' cotton, cotton, cotton
