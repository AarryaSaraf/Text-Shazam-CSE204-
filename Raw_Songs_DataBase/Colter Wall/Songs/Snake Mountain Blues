Mr. Ten Dollar Man
Let me tell where you're bound
Drink your green liquor
Lord, you roll to the ground
Well you come around here
With your money in your hand
Tasting my woman
Well you die where you stand

Well the Snake Mountain blues
Got me down low
I could die in the morning
Ain't no one would know
Well my woman she come around
My body she'd find
Go down in 'Dee
And have her a time

Well my daddy Lord he rides
On a long holy train
The first winds of winter
I see him again
And it's fare well
And it's yellow-headed misery I've known
Snake Mountain's calling, calling me home

Well the Snake Mountain blues
Got me down low
And I could die in the morning
Ain't no one would know
Well my woman she come around
My body she'd find
Go down in Dundee
And have her a time
Have her a time
