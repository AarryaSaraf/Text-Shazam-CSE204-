My name is Bob Fudge I was born in Texas
Lampasas county back during the war
Small pox and Comanches took most of my family
Left my poor mother, my brothers and me

So I headed North to ride for the blockers
They were contracting herds on the Montana range
In the Spring of the year 82 we left old Lampasas
With 2,000 steers for the Little Bighorn

Crossing our trails there were many great rivers
All to be crossed not a bridge would we find
In the cold rolling waters and the wild punching cattle
There was many a young man took leave of his life

Well we crossed at Doan's store into the Indian nation
Saw the blood on the rocks where those cowboys had died
Then it's on Fort Dodge on the Arkansas River
Where gamblers and whores all welcomed us there

And the great snowcapped peaks are on our left side now
For many miles in the great silent land
When I first saw Montana, I knew I would love her
I would ride her great plains til the end of my days

But she's all cut and dry now and the trails are all gone
I've been in Yellowstone Park in an automobile
But I can still see em swimming, boys I can still hear em running
I came off of the trails when cowboys was king

My name is Bob Fudge I died in Montana
