You're lucky she's lonely. You're lucky she's blue
I'd place your bet on the heart broke brunette
With the Waylon tattoo
She's a maiden of misery
You don't need a white horse or chivalry
So, just make your move
You've got nothing to prove
You're lucky she's blue

You're lucky she's lovesick and nipping along
There's no cure but time for a past love unkind
And a busted up home
She can see through your charm
As you reach for her arm
And lead her up to your room
But keep in mind if you do
You're lucky she's blue

You're lucky she's lonely
And she don't give a damn
You ought to walk over
And just hold out your hand
You can see her left hand
Where there once was a band
You're lucky she's lonely
And she don't give a damn
You're lucky she's lonely
You're lucky she's blue
