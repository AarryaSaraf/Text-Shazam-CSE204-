Me and a big Dave were just trying to stay upright
We were chasing white lines and warping our minds last night
We were killing the time though we sure didn't know it
Hunting down rhymes with a Kentucky poet
Me and big Dave were just trying to stay alive

There's some folks around town
That might cuss our names down to the floor
They might claim that were loners
No account stoners and more
It's the same kind of people claim to be chosen
Their ears made of stone and their tongues made of poison
The doctrine they preach has got nothing that they can teach me

Well I don't know if Dave hates the same kind of hate that I do
He knows that I know that he's been cut down by it too
Well people get talking 'bout things that we uses
I ain't in the business of making excuses
Me and big Dave were just trying to stay alive
This whole world's full of ghosts
That I believe that most folks can't see
The particular demons that reason with big Dave and me
