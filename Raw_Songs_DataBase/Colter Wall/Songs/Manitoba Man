I'm ridin' my thumb uptown for to find me a score
There's a Manitoba man behind the fillin' station store
Man, he's got stuff that leaves every limb singin' for more
So I'm ridin' my thumb uptown for to find me a score

My good gal stood by me and I know she's the light of my life
But if I am to be truthful, I don't feel alive 'til it's night
When the hours I'm alone in the dark are the only in sight
But my good gal stood by me and I know she's the light of my life

But my time is past due and I ought to be movin' along
I've been kickin' my feet, wanderin' these streets for too long
My good gal, she tells me she's dreamin' of raisin' a son
But my time is past due, I ought to be movin' along

I reckon I'll make one last stop before I go
He's waitin' for me at the pumps, surely he knows
That twenty-four hours have passed since I last powdered my nose
So I reckon I'll make one last stop before I go
