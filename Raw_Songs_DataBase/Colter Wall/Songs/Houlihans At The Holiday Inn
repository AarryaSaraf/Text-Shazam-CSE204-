One month on the road will leave you wondering
How any man could ever want for more

But three months on the road will leave you stumbling
Falling through another hotel door

Throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn
Haven't put boot heel to belly since can't remember when
And I'll sing you all the songs of my working cowboy kin
Then it's back to throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn

Highwayside grazing herd of cattle
Folks 'round here pulled in a decent yield

A view best taken in from the saddle
I'm staring through this dirty, cracked windshield

Throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn
Haven't put boot heel to belly since can't remember when
And I'll sing you all the songs of my working cowboy kin
Then it's back to throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn

If I'm paid well, a tale I'll tell and sing
And I seldom pay a cent for my drinks
Folks in here tonight they think I'm a king
I'd trade it all for a double rigged saddle and good pair of chinks

Throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn
Haven't put boot heel to belly since can't remember when
And I'll sing you all the songs of my working cowboy kin
Then it's back to throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn
Then it's back to throwing houlihans at the Holiday Inn
