Prayin' on the north wind
Lead me to my door
Thumbing through my green backs
Swearin' I made more
Some cruel nightly cycle
Leaves me cryin' on a motel floor
I don't cry for you
Anymore

Many a dark hour
I look up to the sky
Many unkind thoughts are laid
On my hazy eyes
Sometimes I get to thinkin'
Why wait around to die
I don't think of you
So I get by

Every day it seems
My whole damn life's just a codeine dream
I don't dream of you
Anymore

The sun is gone away now
Green grass turns to brown
Every December it gets a little bit harder
To lay that bottle down
It's more than just the weather
That plagues this prairie town
I won't be seeing you
When I come 'round

Every day it seems
My whole damn life's just a codeine dream
I don't dream of you
Anymore
