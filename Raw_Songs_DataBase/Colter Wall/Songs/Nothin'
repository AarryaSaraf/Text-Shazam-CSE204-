Hey mama, when you leave
Don't leave a thing behind
I don't want nothing
I can't use nothing
Take care into the hall
And if you see my friends
Tell em I'm fine
Not using nothing

Almost burned out my eyes
And threw my ears down to the floor
I didn't see nothing
I didn't hear nothing
I stood there like a block of stone
Knowing all I had to know
And nothing more
Man, that's nothing

Brothers our troubles are
Locked in each others arms
And you better pray
That they never find you
Cause your back ain't strong enough
Burdens doublefold
They'd crush you down
Down into nothing

Being born is going blind
And bowing down a thousand times
To echoes strung
On pure temptation
Sorrow and solitude
These are the precious things
And the only words
That are worth remembering
