// That Lady, Pt. 1 & 2 //

Who's that lady
Beautiful lady
Who's that lady
The real, real, real fine lady
I wish somebody would introduce her to me

I didn't get a chance
To ask her to dance
It was love at first sight
I just saw her tonight
And I wish somebody would introduce her to me

I like the way she danced in the dark
And disappeared in the night
And oh she stole my heart
It was love at first sight

Who's that lady
Beautiful lady
Who's that lady
I gotta meet that lady
And I wish somebody would introduce her to me

Who's that lady
That real fine lady
Who's that lady
That beautiful lady
I wish somebody would introduce her to me

Say hey lady
I'm in love with you

// Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight //

Do me wrong, do me right, do me right, baby
Tell me lies but hold, hold me tight
And save your goodbyes till the mornin' light
But don't let me be lonely tonight

Say goodbye, woman, say hello, hello, hello
Sure enough good to see you, oh, but it's time to go
Don't say, yes, but please, don't say no
I don't wanna be lonely tonight

Go away then damn you
Go and do as you please, go and do as you please, girl
You ain't gonna see me gettin' down on my knees
'Cause I'm undecided and your heart's been divided
You've been turnin' my world upside down, oh babe

Do me wrong, do me right, right now baby
Go on and tell me lies but hold me tight
Save your goodbyes for the mornin' light
But don't let me be lonely tonight

Save your goodbyes for the mornin' light
Lord, I don't wanna be lonely tonight, no, no, no, no
I don't wanna be lonely tonight, no
I don't wanna be lonely tonight, no, no, no, no

Don't let me be lonely tonight
Don't do it, baby
I don't wanna be lonely tonight, no, no, no, no

// If You Were There //

You're the one that makes my day a dream come true,
Yet and still you wander if I think of you,
You ought to see how the other girls behave when you're not around,
And only then you would know that it's on your finger I'm wound

If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
That I care

There's no need for you not to have faith in me,
'cause it's by your side girl that I long to be,
Yes there are times with my friends when I don't have much to say,
What you don't know is with you I could never act that way

If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
That I care

I care for you baby
I swear I care for you
I care for you baby

There's no need for you not to have faith in me,
'cause it's by your side girl that I long to be,
Yes there are times with my friends when I don't have much to say,
What you don't know is with you I could never act that way

If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
If you were there you'd know
That I care

I care for you baby
I swear I care for you
I care for you baby
You know I care for you...

// You Walk Your Way //

You'd been dreaming away
But it's time to leave love
And finally gone
Oh but don't get me wrong

And I'm drifting away
In the years we thought would never end
Let's pray they'll come again

Well, after all this time it took for us to grow
There's no sign of love right now you know
So you walk your way
Let me walk mine
You walk your way
Let me walk mine

Cuz I'm used to planning my days
But it's time I stopped including you
Oh won't you be blue

Cuz although I'm walking away
There's just one wish in mind to meet again
And we will my friend

Said after all this time it took for us to grow
There's no love between us, girl, you know
So you walk your way
Let me walk mine
You walk your way
And I'll walk mine

After all this time it took for us to grow
There's no love between us, girl, you know
So you walk your way
Let me walk mine
You walk your way
And I'll walk mine

And we'll meet again
We will my friend
And things will be much better then

You walk your way
Let me walk mine

You walk your way
Let me walk mine

You walk your way
Let me walk mine

// Listen To The Music //

Don't you feel it growin', day by day
People gettin' ready for the news
Some are happy, some are sad
Oh, we got to let the music play
What the people need
Is a way to make 'em smile
It ain't so hard to do if you know how
Gotta get a message
Get it on through
Oh, now mama's go'n' to after 'while
Oh, oh, listen to the music
Oh, oh, listen to the music
Oh, oh, listen to the music
All the time
Well I know, you know better
Everything I say
Meet me in the country for a day
We'll be happy
And we'll dance
Oh, we're gonna dance our blues away
And if I'm feelin' good to you
And you're feelin' good to me
There ain't nothin' we can't do or say
Feelin' good, feeling fine
Oh, baby, let the music play
Oh, oh, listen to the music
Oh, oh, listen to the music
Oh, oh, listen to the music
All the time
Like a lazy flowing river
Surrounding castles in the sky
And the crowd is growing bigger
List'nin' for the happy sounds
And I got to let them fly
Oh, oh, listen to the music
Oh, oh, listen to the music
Oh, oh, listen to the music
All the time

// What It Comes Down To //

Here I am lovin' you
You're like a dream come true
For so long I've waited for this time
Girl what you mean to me
In reality, you what I ever hoped for
You will always be
More than right for me
Each day I love you more
Well, what it comes down to
This is all I want from you
Yeah, same you want from me that can only be
Love and understanding
For what we have at stake, a little give and take
It's better than demanding
Why do we stay together
Talkin' about you and me'
You got your reasons
I got mine
Oh, if it had to be, one and only me
Sure would be a drag now
Need somebody who, needs somebody to
Keep from bein' sad now
Well, what it comes down to
This is all I want from you
Same you want from me that can only be
Love and understanding
For what we have at stake, a little give and take
It's better than demanding
Ah, what it comes down to
This is all I want from you
Same you want from me that can only be
Love and understanding
For what we have at stake, a little give and take
It's better than demanding
Well, what it comes down to
That's all I want baby
What it comes down to
That's all I want from you
What it comes down to
That's all I want baby
What it comes down to
That's all I want baby
What it comes down to
That's all I want from you
What it comes down to
That's all I want baby
What it comes down to
That's all I want from you
What it comes down to
That's all I want from you

// Sunshine (Go Away Today) //

Sunshine go away today
I don't feel much like dancing
Some man's gone, he's tried to run my life
He don't know what he's asking

He tells me I'd better get in line
Can't hear what he's saying
When I grow up I'm going to make it mine
But these aren't dues I been paying

How much does it cost?
I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost
I'll try it
He can't even run his own life
He can't even run his own life
I'll be damned if he'll run mine, sunshine

Sunshine go away today
I don't feel much like dancing
Some man's gone, he's tried to run my life
He don't know what he's asking

Working starts to make me wonder where
The fruits of what I do are going
He says in love and war all is fair
But he's got cards he ain't showing

How much does it cost?
I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost
I'll try it
He can't even run his own life
He can't even run his own life
I'll be damned if he'll run mine

Sunshine go away

Sunshine, come on back another day
I promise you I'll be singing
This old world, she's gonna turn around
Brand new bells'll be ringing

// Summer Breeze //

[Chorus:]
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind

See the curtains hanging in the window
In the evening on a Friday night
A little light shining through the window
Lets me know everything's alright

[Repeat chorus]

Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom
July is dressed up and playing her tune
When I come home from a hard days work
And you're waiting there, not a care in the world

See the smile waiting in the kitchen
Food cooking and the plates for two
Feel the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through

[Repeat chorus]

// The Highways Of My Life //

Moving down the highways of my life
Makin' sure I stay to the right
Moving down the highways of my life
So I shan't be concerned with the other side of the road
Reading all the signs along the way
Knowing where I am not what they say
My destination's closer day by day
So I can't concern with the other side of the road

Da da dop da da ah
Down the highway da de ah
Da da dop da da ah
Down the highway da de ah
Da da dop da da ah
Down the highway da de ah
Da da dop da de ah
Down the highway da de ah

Leaving all the sorrows and the pain
There's no love between us that remains
Although you are the one you're not the same
So the other side of the road can only take me back home

Da da dop da da ah
Down the highway da de da
Da da dop da da ah
Down the highway da de da
Da da dop da da ah
Down the highway da de da
Da da dop da de ah
Down the highway da de ah
Da da dop da da ah
Down the highway da de da
Da da dop da de ah
Down the highway da de ah
Da da dop da da ah
Down the highway da de da
Da da dop da de ah
Down the highway da de ah
