// Floatin' On Your Love //

Do you want to float on, yeah
Do you want to float, yeah

Float on, float on, float all your love
Float on, float on, float all your love

I call my baby's name
She gives me everything
She takes me higher and higher
She plays with my desire
She knows my pleasures on
And works it all night long
Her love is slow and slick
Told me don't come too quick

Every day I pray our love
Floats on and on and on
Hear me calling out to you, girl
It's all that I can do, girl

Float on, float on, float all your love
Float on, float on, float all your love

I know what's on his mind
He wants it all the time
He's always at my door
Keeps asking me for more
Says he can't get enough
Sometimes he likes a rub
Ya know I'm gonna treat him right
Gonna do it day and night

Every day I pray our love
Floats on and on and on
Hear me calling out to you, boy
That's all that I can do, boy

Float on, float on, float all your love
Float on, float on, float all your love

Float on, float on, float all your love
Float on, float on, float all your love

Do you want to float on
Do you want to float on

Float on, float on, float all your love
Float on, float on, float all your love

// Tears //

Thank you, baby
For the years you've given me
For each beat of my heart
For every breath I breathe
Thank you, sweetie
For the best times of my life
Through the good, through the bad
You were always by my side
I never thought I meet someone
Who loves unselfishly
But I appreciate the way you loved
And sacrificed for me

I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
(although a man's not suppose to cry)
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die
(you've given so much to my life)

Thank you, lady
For the joy you bring to life
When I thought all was lost and gone
You brought hope back in sight
Thank you, honey
For being my best friend
When I thought no one understood
You would always understand
I used to think that I knew love
And what true love should mean
Now I know that I did not know much
'cause you taught me everything

I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
(although a man's not suppose to cry)
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die
(you've given so much to my life)

God so loved the world
That he blessed us all with you
And then he gave me a heart
Now I'm giving it to you
And these tears I cry are tears of joy
My happiness, I do rejoice
In the love you give unselfishly
Your constant sacrifice for me

I can't hold back these tears
Let me cry
(although a man's not suppose to cry)
If I hold back my tears
I'll just die
(you've given so much to my life)

// Can I Have A Kiss (For Old Time's Sake)? //

Start off with a hug, lead into embrace
Oh girl, I'm glad to see you, oh face-to-face
Not a day of age, oh and by the way

// Holding Back The Years //

Holding back the years,
Thinking of the fear Ive had for so long.
When somebody hears,
Listen to the fear thats gone.
Strangled by the wishes of father,
Hoping for the arm of mother,
Get to me sooner or later,

Nothing ever could, yeah.
I'll keep holding on,

Holding back the years,
Chance for me to escape from all I know.
Holding back the tears.
Theres nothing here has grown.
Ive wasted all my tears,
Wasted all those years.
Nothing had the chance to be good,
Nothing ever could, yeah.

I'll keep holding on,
I'll keep holding on,
I'll keep holding on,
I'll keep holding on
So tight.

I've wasted all my tears,
Wasted all those years.

Nothing ever could, yeah.

I'll keep holding on,

I'll keep holding on,
I'll keep holding on
So tight.
