// Smooth Sailin' Tonight //

Nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
There'll be nothin' but, nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
Every single heartache will be kissed and loved away
And at my desires height the body will obey
Lay your hands on me, girl, touch my burnin' sand
Let your waters calm me, your wish is my command
You can count on me, yeah
(Count on me)
I'll set you free and easy
Any fantasy, yeah
Will be acted out completely
Nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
(Oh, baby)
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
(You know, you know)
There'll be nothin' but, nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
(Oh)
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
(I know, I know)
Lay down here beside me and we'll cruise the caravan
Let your fingers guide me to the pleasures you demand
Let my lips caress the deepest portals of your soul
Feel the fire I possess, I got to let you know, girl
You can count on me, girl
(Count on me)
I'll set you free and easy
(Every)
Any fantasy
Will be acted out completely
Nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
(Oh)
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
(Oh, yeah)
There'll be nothin' but, nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
(Nothin?)
(Oh, baby)
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
(Oh)
Every single heartache will be kissed and loved away
And at my desires height the body will obey
Lay your hands on me, girl, touch my burnin' sand
Let your waters calm me, your wish is my command
(Count on me)
Oh, I'll set you free and easy
Any fantasy
(Any fantasy)
Will be acted out completely
Nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
(You know, you know)
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
There'll be nothin' but, nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
(Oh, yeah)
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
(Are you ready, girl)
Let's go sailin', sailin', girl
Don't you wanna go, wanna go, wanna go sailin'?
(Count on me)
I'll set you free and easy
(Every fantasy)
Will be acted out completely, oh
Nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
(Oh baby, baby)
There'll be nothin' but, nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
(Nothin? but smooth, smooth)
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
(Nothin? but smooth)
There'll be nothin' but, nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
(Smooth)
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
(Smooth)

// I Wish //

Ohhh, ooooh, ooooh, baby, ooooh
When you're far away, my body longs for you
When you shed a tear, my heart bleeds for you, girl
When you're feeling down, the sun just doesn't shine
When you're not around, oh, I'm sad, baby
Oh, baby, I sure do miss your love
I want you here, here with me, yeah

I wish that I could hold you
Oh, I wish, baby, I wish
I wish that I could touch you, oh you know, you know that I wish, baby
I wish that I could make you feel alright, alright, alright

When I'm all alone, I think only of you, baby
I lay awake at night burning with desire
When I close my eyes, I always see your face
When I'm wide-awake, I fantasize
And, ooh, baby, I'm longing for your touch
I really miss your kisses, I need you, ooh, so much

I wish that I, I wish, I wish, I wish, baby
Wish that I could 
I wish that I, ah, hey, hey, hey, hey, could touch you
I wish that I, ah, you know, I wish, I could make you feel make you feel, 
Alright, alright
I wish that I, I wish baby, could hold you, ah you know, you know,
you know I wish baby, could touch you

Oh, I wish, baby, could make you feel, make you feel alright,
oh, alright, alright

I miss your warm embrace, I miss your smiling face
I miss your tender kiss, there's nothing I miss more than this
I miss those nights together
Oh, they were so right whenever
I miss the way you squeeze me
You bring me to my knees, baby

I wish that I
I'd do anything
Could hold you
To hold you in my arms once again, I wish that I
And ooh, ooooh, ooooh, could touch you
And I, I, I, I wish that I could make you feel, make you feel, you feel, alright, alright
I wish that I
And I wish, I wish, baby, baby
I wish that I 
I pray and wish that I could touch you, ooooh
I wish that I could make you feel, I want to make you feel, alright, alright
I wish that I
