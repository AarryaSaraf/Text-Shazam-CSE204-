// The Pride //

Politician come to power take it slow
People need what you know
You're a leader so you have to play along
Show the hand right or wrong
When you're feelin' that you know the way to turn
Either way still get burned
It's the pride that makes you feel that you belong
It's the pride that keeps you strong

Don't you think it's fascinating?
Don't you think it's fascinating?
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride
(when you finally break it all down it's the pride)
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride
(when you finally break it all down it's the pride)

What makes you want to do the best you can?
What makes you a better man?
What makes you try again before too long?
What keeps you standing strong?
What makes you say the things you want to say.
To make it a better day?
It's the pride that makes you feel that you belong
It's the pride that keeps you strong

Don't you think it's fascinating?
Don't you think it's fascinating?
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride
(when you finally break it all down it's the pride)
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride
(when you finally break it all down it s the pride)

// Footsteps In The Dark //

Are we really sure
Can a love that lasted for so long still endure?
Do I, really care? Hey, hey
Let's talk about the distractions goin' on elsewhere

I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, in the dark
Why? I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, in the dark

My mind drifts now and then
Lookin' down dark corridors and wonders what might have been
Something's up ahead,
Hey, should I keep this same direction or go back instead?

I, I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, in the dark
Why? I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, in the dark

Honey, now lets stop walkin' around
When there's love lost to be found
And you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense in goin' elsewhere?

Who feels really sure?
Can that feelin' guarantee your happiness shall endure?
And do we, really care? Hey, hey
Let's look at what's been happenin' and try to be more aware

I, I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, in the dark
Why? I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, in the dark

Yeah, lets stop walkin' around
Well when there's love lost, lost to be found
Honey, you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense in goin', goin' elsewhere?

Honey, lets stop walkin' around and around and around
When there's  no love to be found
Baby, you know, I still care, I still care
What's the sense of goin', goin' elsewhere?

// Tell Me When You Need It Again //

Tell me when you need it again
Tell me when you need it again
What s comin' over your mind?
You wanted my sugar this time
We're good together i know
Why would you go lookin' for new love tomorrow?

(why won't you) tell me when you need it again
(come on and) tell me when you need it again
(why don't you) tell me when you need it again
(why don't you) tell me when you need it again
Tell me when you need it baby
I can keep you satisfied
Tell me when you need it baby
So I can keep you satisfied

You say we're needin' a change
We should be doin' other things
But when you're feelin' my touch
You don't be complaining as much

(why won't you) tell me when you need it again
(come on and) tell me when you need it again
(why don't you) tell me when you need it again
(why don't you) tell me when you need it again
Tell me when you need it baby
I can keep you satisfied
Tell me when you need it baby
So I can keep you satisfied

You say you needed my sugar
And now you're changin' your mind
Why don't you get it together?
And stop wasting my time
Tell me when you need me baby
I can keep you satisfied
Tell me when you need me baby
So I can keep you satisfied

// Climbing Up The Ladder //

Climbin' up the ladder
I keep pushin' and I'm bound to know
Climbin' climbin' the ladder
Though it be shakin'
Ain't it up that I gotta go?

Keep me in the backroads
Why should I stay down?
I keep tryin', tryin' my best now baby
To reach that solid ground

Ain't nothin' wrong baby, ain't nothin' wrong in believin' in a dream
Ain't nothin' wrong baby, ain't nothin' wrong though the evidence unseen

Climbin' up the ladder
I keep pushin' and I'm bound to know
Climbin' climbin' up the ladder
Though it be shakin'
Ain't it up that I gotta go?

Reach out for the wisdom
Touchin' it every day
I keep reachin' for my next step baby
I keep hopin' that I find a way

Ain't nothin' wrong baby, ain't nothin' wrong in believin' in a dream
Ain't nothin' wrong baby, ain't nothin' wrong though the evidence unseen

Climbin' up the ladder
I keep pushin' and I'm bound to know
Climbin' climbin' up the ladder
Though it be shakin'
Ain't it up that I gotta go?

Seekin' satisfaction
Doubt that I believe?
But don't try me try my faith now baby
I said daniel's stopped the mouths of beasts!

Ain't nothin' wrong baby, ain't nothin' wrong in believin' in a dream
Ain't nothin' wrong baby, ain't nothin' wrong though the evidence unseen

// Voyage To Atlantis //

Can I go on my way without you
Whoa...how can I know
If I go on my way without you
Whoa...where would I go

Set sail with me
Misty lady, set my spirit free
New love to find
And though I leave another behind

I'll always (Come back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)

She's my lady, now and ever
Whoa...how can I know
Can we go all the way together
Whoa...let it be so

So we'll say our last goodbye
And we'll make it this time
Hey...ho...set sail with me
To a paradise out beyond the sea

Atlantis (Is back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)
Atlantis (Is back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)

Atlantis (Is back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)
Atlantis (Is back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)

Atlantis (Is back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)
I'll always (Come back to you)

// Livin' In The Life //

Somebody said, I was living in the life
Somebody told me, I was living in the life
Think that you might know, you find that you're really wrong
My pictures come and go but my living has got to go on

And if you think it's easy it's only 'cause
You ain't me and I ain't you
Check out the difference between the two

Somebody said, it was easy in my life
Somebody told me, I had made it in my life
Try to understand my determination win
You can't only stand on the outside looking in

And if you think it's easy it's only 'cause
You ain't me and I ain't you
Check out the difference between the two

Somebody said, I was living in the life
Somebody told me, I was living in the life
Try to understand my determination win
You can't only stand on the outside looking in

You ain't me and I ain't you
That's the horrible difference between the two

// Go For Your Guns //

Y'all shoot your best shot and keep on livin ...yeah!
