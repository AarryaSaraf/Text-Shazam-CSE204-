// May I? //

May I beg you
Out of some lovin'?
One more time
Please, baby

Oh, and may I beg you
Out of some lovin'?
One more time
Oh, may I?

It's not enough
Don't walk away
Girl, please, you be mine
Stay, lady, stay

I wanna touch you
If I may
You are the sunshine
My beautiful, beautiful girl

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh

May I just beg you
(May I?)
Out of some lovin'?

One more time
(May I?)
Please, baby

One more time
(May I?)
Oh, may I?

The touch of you
Sets me on fire
Can't get enough
You're my desire

My melody
Sweet rhapsody
Girl, let me live in
This fantasy, baby

Satisfy me, ooh
I will satisfy you too
You need a man who'll be slow and
That understands you too, oh

Oh, may I beg you
(May I?)
Out of some lovin'
(May I?)

One more time
(May I?)
Pretty please, baby

Fantasy

Let me live my fantasy, please, baby

Gotta have you, gotta have you, girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You know what
You tantalize me
You hypnotize me
With your beautiful eyes, baby

You mesmerize me
You satisfy me
You drivin' me wild, oh, baby

May I, must I?
Sugar, may I, must I?
I never know
May I, must I?
Honey, may I, can I?

// My Best Was Good Enough //

Sittin' by the windows all alone
Tryin' to understand just what went wrong
The girl I love has gone away
But the reason why she left, she didn't say

Perhaps she just got tired of makin' plans
And promises of things we never had
Well, I done my best, yet things got kind of worse
But for me, my best was good enough
Good enough

I tried to keep an open mind
That she would come to realize, in time
But as I go from day to day
I tell myself that there's no other way

Perhaps she never, never understood
That this man was doin' the best he could
I wish the girl all the very, very best of luck
But for me, my best was good enough

Oh, my best, my best, baby

Oh, perhaps she never, never understood
That this man was doin' the best, the best he could
I wish the girl all the very best of luck
But for me, my best was good enough

My best, my best was good enough

But for me my best was good enough

I know, I know my best was good
Oh, my best was good enough
I wanna wish this girl
All the best of luck, I do
Oh, but for me, my best was good enough
Yes, it was

Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know my best is good enough, yeah
I wish you, baby
I wish you, baby
All the best of luck
Ah, yes, I do

// If Leaving Me Is Easy //

If leaving me is easy
Then you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
Then you know coming back is harder

If leaving me is easy
Then you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
Then you know coming back is harder

I read all your letters
I read each word that you've sent to me though it's past now
And your words start to fade
All the memories I have still remain

I've kept all the pictures
I hide my feelings so no one knows, no one
Oh, sure, my friends all come round
But I'm in a crowd, I'm on my own
'Cause you're gone though your heart, heart still remains
And it'll be here if you come again

You see I'd heard the rumors
I knew before you let me know, you let me know
But I didn't believe it
You would not let me go
Seems I was wrong and I love you, love you the same
And that's the one thing that you can't take away

So just remember
(I love you)
(Remember I love you)

If leaving me is easy
Then you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
Then you know coming back is harder

// You Never Know When You're Gonna Fall In Love //

I had it all worked out
I thought I knew just what I want
But, girl, as it turned out
I guess I really didn't know at all

I've been playin' life by the ear
Now the words of love I hear
Is so very clear

Whenever you are near
It's like a spell that's taken over me
What's happenin', my dear?
It wasn't in my plans to fall in love

But, girl, what can I do?
You see, I'm so in love with you
I'm so in love, baby

You never know when
(You're gonna fall in love)
Oh, it just seems to happen

You never know when
(You're gonna fall in love)
You see, love has no sense of time

You never know when
You're gonna fall in love
Love

Since you came around
There's been a certain change in me
And in your love I felt
I slowly found myself turnin' around

How could I let myself go?
I guess you'll never really know
Ah, ah, you never, never, never, ever, ever know

You never know when
(You're gonna fall in love)
Oh, boy, it just seems to happen

You never know when
(You're gonna fall in love)
You see, love has no sense of time

You never know when
You're gonna fall

Love has no sense of time
Love has no sense of time

Ooh, hoo, you never know when
You're gonna fall in love

// Stay Cold //

Think
Upon that moment long ago
One breath away and there you will be
So young and carefree
Again you will see
That place in time, so gold

Steal
Away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather
Nothing can ever
And be in time, stay gold

But can it be
When we can see
So vividly
A memory?

And, yes, you will say
So must the day
Too, fade away
And leave a ray
Of sun so gold

Life
Is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined
All things that happen
Will age too old, though gold

Though
Though gold

Life
Is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined
All things, all things that happen
Will age too old, though gold

Though
Though gold

Stay gold
Stay gold

// Colder Are My Nights //

It's looking better
More and more every day
Anything's better
Than the reason I've moved away

If those days can look brighter
Means everything is possible
For so long on my own
Had some time on my hands

The colder are my nights
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
Means I need you more and more

The colder are my nights
Means I can't do without you too long
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Uh, uh, uh
Uh

You made the difference
And what a difference it is
You made me realize
What is life without you

Since those days when nothing goes right
Things get almost but not quiet
They get so sore, they come close
They get so sore, uh, uh

Colder are my nights
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
Means I need you more and more

Colder are my nights
Means I can't do without you too long
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Colder are my nights
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
Means I need you more and more

The colder are my nights
Means I can't do without you too long
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, ha
Well
Ooh
Mmm, mmm

The colder are my nights, ooh
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
Means I need you more and more

The colder are my nights
Means I can't do without you too long
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Colder are my nights
Means I need you more and more
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Colder are my nights
Means I can't do without you too long
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Hoo
Hoo
Yeah, yeah

(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
It's so cold, yeah
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Colder are my nights, ooh
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
So cold

Colder are my nights
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
It's so cold, well

Colder are my nights, yeah
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
So cold
(So cold, my nights)

Colder are my nights
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
Yeah, they're so cold
(So cold, my nights)

Colder are my nights
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
So cold
(So cold, my nights)

Colder are my nights
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
I know it's cold, yeah, yeah
(So cold, my nights)

Colder are my nights
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
So cold
(So cold, my nights)
Really so cold

// Come To Me //

Standing in the rain
Teardrops begin to fall
I could feel your pain
Raindrops just hide it all

He said I didn't need you, made you cry
You turned and walked away
I was there again with my arms open wide
Didn't you hear me say?

(Come to me)
I'll show you better ways
(Come to me)
I love you, girl

(Come to me)
Oh, babe
(Come to me)

Wanting you to hold
I chased your love through the storm
Out of self control
The thought was enough to keep me warm

Girl, I really need you
I'm yours forever and a day
It's clear for you to see
So don't ignore your heart when I say

(Come to me)
I'll show you better ways
(Come to me)
Oh, I love you, girl

(Come to me)
Please, babe
(Come to me)
Come to me

Take a chance, don't you be afraid
Let tonight persuade you to come to me
Let it go, what's over now
I'll never let you down, come to me

(Come to me)
(Come to me)
Oh, my arms are open wide
Please stand by my side

(Come to me)
Please come to me, baby
(Come to me)
I need to really love you, girl

(Come to me)
(Come to me)
Oh, I'll chase your love through the storm
Please, girl, won't you keep me warm?

(Come to me)
Please come to me, baby
(Come to me)
I need to really love you, girl

(Come to me)
Please come to me, baby
(Come to me)
I need to really love you, girl

Come to me
Come to me

// Release Your Love //

// The Most Beautiful Girl //

Oh yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm oh, I'm so, so sorry baby
Oh, yes sorry

Well hey, and if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world
And if you did was she crying, crying?

Hey, if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Won't you, won't you please tell her that I love
I still love her? Oh, yes I do

Look in here, I woke up this morning
And I realized what I had done
And I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
Knew I lost my morning sun

Oh yeah, I lost my head and said something
Now in this morning all of the heartache brings
I was lying and I, I couldn't see her
And I let this little fine thing walk away, walk away on me, yeah

And hey, if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world
And if you did
Just tell her I'm sorry, sorry I'm oh so sorry

And hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl
Oh, walked out on me, on me
Tell her I missed her, do it for me
Tell her I need, oh I need my baby

Won't, won't somebody, somebody tell I'm sorry? Sorry, yes I'm
Oh, I know I was wrong
Took me a long, long, long, long time
To see what I was doing here
Oh and she didn't say nothing

One of these days I gonna find my baby
So if you see me lookin'
Look, look, look, look, look, look, lookin'
Somebody help me, help me somebody

If you see this little fine thing
About that tall
Long, long, long black wavy hair y'all
That's my baby, yeah that's my baby
