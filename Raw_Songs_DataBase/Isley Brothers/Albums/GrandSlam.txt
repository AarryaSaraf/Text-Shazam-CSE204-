// Tonight Is The Night (If I Had You) //

(Talking)
Tonight is the night baby
You know for the first time in my life
I think I found what I want

Tonight is the night, I wanna be with you
You're the kind of woman, I wanna hold on to
Come a little closer, let me show you how much I care
Tonight is the night, please stay right here

Oh, life would be so sweet if I had you
Don't you know that life would be so sweet if I had you

Let me show you a love you never felt before
I'm gonna give you all that I have, and then some more
Come on baby I know you want me to
Kiss me this way and that way and this way baby
Til I'm all over you

Life could be so sweet if I had you
Life could be so sweet if I had you

Oh, tonight is the night
(You know girl, I thought I seen it all)
But you're something special, very special

And I've been all over the world, trying to find someone like you
But for the first time in my life, I realize it wasn't so easy to do
But now that I found your love, I want let you get away no
Cause you're the sunshine that brightens up my day

Life would be so sweet if I had you
Life would be so sweet if I had you

(Tonight is the night) 
I wanna be with you
(Oh oh, tonight is the night)
You got the kind of loving, I wanna hold on to
(Oh oh, tonight is the night)
Come a little closer and let me show you how much I care
(Oh oh, tonight is the night)
Tonight is the night, please stay right here

Oh Life would be so sweet if I had you
Life would be so sweet if I had you
If I had you girl, I'd know that
Life would be so sweet if I had you
Life would be so sweet if I had you

// I Once Had Your Love (And I Can't Let Go) //

Every day I think of you
Can't believe it's true that I'm so into you
That I don't know where I'm goin'
I never felt this way before
All I wanna do is to love you, baby
Behind closed doors
Ooh, I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
Don't let go
All of the good times that we shared
Every day's a holiday
We could celebrate makin' love together
Ooh, let's keep this fire burnin'
Every day is new, girl

Can't let you go
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
Girl, I can't let you go
Sure as Heaven above
We found love
You and I can fly away
Maybe to L.A. or some lovely island
Take a stroll along the ocean
Building castles in the sand
Doin' all the things we planned together
Ooh, I love you so much, baby
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go

I once had your lovin', baby
And I can't let go
Can't let it go, no, no
Ooh, I once had your lovin', baby
