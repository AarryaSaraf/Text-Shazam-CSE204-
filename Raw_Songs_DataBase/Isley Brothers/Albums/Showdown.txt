// Showdown, Pts. 1 & 2 //

Besides who is he to lay in the covers of my home

I was the one that belived in all of her dreams and she did me wrong
So prepare yourself..

Somebodys been foolin around in my home, wearin my clothes, drivin my car
God help me

Somebodys been foolin around in my home, wearin my clothes, drivin my car

Now first things first
Where's this cat from

// Groove With You //

Oh, I've been thinking of you
and you've been thinking of me.
Oh, I'll give all that I have
If you'll give all that I need.
And oh, oh, oh, lets be fair.
And I think its time we cleared the air.
I've been watching you, you've been watching me.
You know I've been wanting to groove with you.
Girl, speak your mind.
Groove with you.
You been thinking all of this time.
Groove with you.
Aw baby what I wouldn't do.
Groove with you.
Just spending my days with you.

Oh, love is all in your eyes,
love fire is burning for me.
You stay all in my mind.
Oh woman, its easy to see.
Oh, lets be fair
You know its time we cleared the air

You've been watching me, I've been watching you.
You know, you know,
Groove with you.
Oh I want a groove, I want a groove
Groove with you.
I've been thinking, you've been thinking, thinking of me.
Groove with you.
Oh what I wouldn't do to groove with you.

Groove with you.
You've been watching, I been watching watching you
Groove with you
And every chance I get, from the first time we meet
I want a groove with you.

// Ain't Givin' Up No Love //

I ain't givin' up no love this mornin'
I ain't givin' up love, no, I won't
She said, "I ain't givin' up no love this mornin'"
I ain't givin' up love at all

Covered up emotions
But I can't hide, oh, what it shows
Inside love double feelings
Runnin' hot and, oh, runnin' cold

No reason to make believe
You know how it's gonna be
Oh, this time around
Say just what you wanna say

But the feeling is gone away
'Cause you know what I'm feeling inside
I ain't givin' up no love this mornin'
I ain't givin' up love, no

She ain't givin' up no love this mornin'
She ain't givin' up love at all
Play the song
No reason to make believe

You know how it's gonna be
Oh, this time around
Say just what you wanna say
But the feeling is gone away

'Cause you know what I'm feelin' inside
I ain't givin' up no love this mornin'
I ain't givin' up love, no

She ain't givin' up no love this mornin'
She ain't givin' up no love at all
