// Ohio //

Tin Soldiers and Nixon Coming
We're Finnaly on our own
This summer I hear the drumming
Four Dead in Ohio

Gotta Get Down to, Soldier are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her and found her dead on the ground
How can you run when you know?
Laa Laa Laa
Laa Laa Laa
Laa Laa Laa
Laa Laa Laa

Gotta Get Down to, Soldier are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her and found her dead on the ground
How can you run when you know?

Tin Soldiers and Nixon Coming
We're Finnaly on our own
This summer I hear the drumming
Four Dead in Ohio

// Fire And Rain //

(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)

I always thought
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
I will see you again
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)

I always thought
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
I will see you again
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)

Now I see fire
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
I've seen rain
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)

Seen sunny days
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
I thought would never end
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)

I always thought
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
When will I see you again
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
I always thought

Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this mornin' and I wrote down this song
Now I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Girl I thought that I'd see you
Girl I thought that I'd see you
Girl I thought that I'd see you

So won't you like down on me Jesus
You gotta help me make a stand
You just got to see me through another day
My body's achin' and my time is at hand
And I just can't make it any other way

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you

Girl I thought that I'd see you
I thought that I'd see you
I thought I'd see you babe

Walkin' my mind back to easy times my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
There's hours of time on the telephone line talking about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

Oh I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
Oh but I always thought that I'd see you again

Girl I thought I'd see you, babe
Thought that I'd see you
Thought I'd see you

I always thought
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
When I see you again
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)

I've seen fire
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
I've seen rain
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)

Seen sunny days
(Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you again)
I thought would never end
(Thought I'd see you)

// Lay Lady Lay //

Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed

Whatever colors
You have in your mind
I'll show them to you
And you'll see them shine

Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed

Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile
Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile

Until the break of day
Let me see you make him smile
Stay, lady, stay
Stay, lady, stay
Stay, lady, stay, lady
Stay, lady, stay, lady

His clothes are dirty
But his, his hands are clean
And you're the best thing
That he's ever seen

Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile
Stay, lady, stay
Stay, lady, stay
Stay, lady, stay, lady
Stay, lady, stay, lady

Why wait any longer
For the world to begin
You can have your cake
And eat it too

Why wait any longer
For the one you love
When he's standing, standing
Standing in front of you

Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed

Stay, lady, stay
Stay while the
Night is still ahead
Stay, lady, stay
Stay, lady, stay
Stay, lady, stay, lady
Stay, lady, stay, lady

I long to see you
In the morning light
I wanna reach for you
In the night

Please, lady
Please, lady
Stay while the
Night is still ahead

Stay, lady, stay
Lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lady
Keep your shoes off, lady
Relax yourself awhile

Stay, lady, stay
Lay, lady, lay
Stay, lady, stay
Relax yourself awhile
Lay, lady, lay

Stay, lady, stay
Relax yourself awhile
Lay, lady, lay

Lay, lady, lay
Lay, lady, lay...

// Spill The Wine //

I was once out strolling,
One hot summer day.
When I thought I'd lay,
Myself down to rest.

In a big field,
Of tall grass,
I lay there in the sun and I,
Felt it caressin' my face.

As I fell asleep,
I dreamed that I was in a Hollywood movie,
And that I was the star,
Of the movie.

This really blew my mind,
But there I was,
Oh yeah I was.
I was taken to the place,
The hall of the mountain king.

I stood high upon the mountaintop,
Naked to the world.
In front of me,
Was every kind of girl.

There was long ones, tall ones,
Short ones, brown ones,
Black ones, round ones,
Big crazy ones.

Out of the middle,
Came a lady.
She whispered in my ear,
Somethin' crazy...

[Chorus:]
Spill the wine; take that pearl.
Spill the wine; take that pearl.
Spill the wine; take that pearl.
Spill the wine; take that pearl.
[End Chorus]

I thought to myself,
What could this mean?
Am I going crazy,
Or is it just a dream?

Now wait a minute...

I know I'm lying,
In a field of grass somewhere.
It was all in my head.
But then I heard,
Somebody say...

[Repeat chorus]

I could feel hot flames,
Of fire roaring at my back,
As she disappeared.
But soon she returned.

In her hand was a bottle of wine,
And in the other, a glass,
Good god.

She poured some of that wine,
From the bottle into the glass.
And she raised it to her lip,
And before she drank it, she said...

[Repeat chorus]

Spill, spill, spill that wine.
Come on, take that pearl.
Come on and spill that wine.
Come on and take that pearl.

Spill that wine!

[Repeat chorus]

Spill, spill, spill...
Spill, spill, spill that wine.
Come on and spill that wine.
Come on, take that pearl.
Come on and spill that wine.

[Repeat chorus]

Come on and spill that wine.
Take that pearl.
Come on spill that wine.
Take that pearl.

[Repeat chorus]

Come on and spill it...
Come on and spill it...

// Nothing To Do But Today //

Been on the road too long
Most of these changes should be past and gone
Clarify my position
Must be some kind of fool, I'm a musician

I got nothin' to do but today

Already on my way
Goodbye, I can't stop to say
Just quietly slipped away
Lose myself, it's the only way 

I got nothin' to do but today

You think I'm not myself
You're confusing me with somebody else
I'm not so easily deceived
I am a blues man, I know when to leave

I got nothin' to do but today
Oh, like today
Oh, but today

// Love The One You're With //

If you're down and confused
And you don't remember who you're talking to
Concentration slips away
Because you're baby is so far away

Well, there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with

Don't be angry, don't be sad
Don't sit crying talking 'bout the good times you've had
Well, there's a girl sitting right next to you
And she's just waiting for something to do

Well, there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
And if you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo

Lord, love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
Why don't you love

Turn your heartaches right into joy, now
She's a girl, yeah, and you're a boy
I want you to get it together and make it nice
Well, you ain't gonna need anymore advice

Hey, there's a rose in a fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
Sometimes you can't be with the one you love, honey
Love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with
You got to love the one you're with

You gotta love (love the one you're with)
You gotta love (love the one you're with)
Oh, love (love the one you're with)
You gotta love (love the one you're with)
Woah yeah (love the one you're with)
You gotta love, love the one you're with
(love the one you're with)
You gotta love (love the one you're with)

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
