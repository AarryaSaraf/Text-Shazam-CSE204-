pretty little baby
Won't you listen to my heart?
My needs are simple
And you're what i've been needing from the start

Like honey
To a honeybee
You got me buzzing
I see what i need

I ain't lying
Gonna lay it on the line
This is the moment tonight
I got to make you mine

Like candy
To a wild-eyed child
I see what i want
And it's driving me wild

Release your love
Girl you got to give it up to me oh baby
Very good so good
Release your love to me
Only you can set me free

Wanna get closer
Ooh let's go somewhere hey baby
Where we can get closer yeah

You've been distant
You've been playin' hot and sweet
I've been burning
All fired up by your heat i'm hot baby

Just look at me
I'm on my knees
My sincere intention
Is only to please

Release your love

Girl you got to give it up to me oh baby
Very good so good
Release your love to me
Only you can set me

Oh set me free
Come on baby closer
Let's go somewhere tonight
Where we can get closer

Oh just look at me
I'm on my knees
My sincere intention
Is only to please

Release your love
Yeah give it up to me
I know it's good for me
Very good so good
Release your love to me
Only you can set me

Oh come on baby
Release your love come on
Very good so good
Release your love

Give it up turn it loose
Where you goin'?
Come on baby
Need it right now

Baby be good so good
Release your love to me
Release your love love
So good so good
Oh it's so good

Release your love baby
It's so good
