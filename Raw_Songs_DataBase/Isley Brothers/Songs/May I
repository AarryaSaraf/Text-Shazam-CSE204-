May I beg you
Out of some lovin'?
One more time
Please, baby

Oh, and may I beg you
Out of some lovin'?
One more time
Oh, may I?

It's not enough
Don't walk away
Girl, please, you be mine
Stay, lady, stay

I wanna touch you
If I may
You are the sunshine
My beautiful, beautiful girl

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh

May I just beg you
(May I?)
Out of some lovin'?
(May I?)

One more time
(May I?)
Please, baby
(May I?)

Oh, may I beg you
(May I?)
Out of some lovin'?
(May I?)

One more time
(May I?)
Oh, may I?
(May I?)

The touch of you
Sets me on fire
Can't get enough
You're my desire

My melody
Sweet rhapsody
Girl, let me live in
This fantasy, baby

Satisfy me, ooh
I will satisfy you too
You need a man who'll be slow and
That understands you too, oh

Oh, may I beg you
(May I?)
Out of some lovin'
(May I?)

One more time
(May I?)
Pretty please, baby
(May I?)

Must I beg
(May I?)
You out of some lovin'?
(May I?)

One more, one more, one more, one more
(May I?)
One more time
(May I?)

It's not enough
Don't walk away
Girl, please be mine
Stay, lady, stay

My melody
My rhapsody
Girl, let me live in my
Fantasy

I wanna live it
Let me live my fantasy, please, baby
I need you
Gotta have you, gotta have you, girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You know what
You tantalize me
You hypnotize me
With your beautiful eyes, baby

You mesmerize me
You satisfy me
You drivin' me wild, oh, baby

May I, must I?
Sugar, may I, must I?
I never know
May I, must I?
Honey, may I, can I?
