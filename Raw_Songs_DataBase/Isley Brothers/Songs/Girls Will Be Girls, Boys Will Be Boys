Girls will be girls, boys will be boys
One day they're lovers
And you know the next day
They're fighting one another

They'll work it out between them two
They'll kiss and make up
Oh, you know lovers always do now

They're in a problem they can't solve now
Oh, don't you get yourself involved, baby
They may argue with each other now
Oh, but 

You know they'll work it out now
Between them two
They'll kiss and make up
I know 'cos lovers all always do

Girls will be girls, boys will be boys
One day they're lovers
And you know the next day
They're fighting one another

They'll work it out between them two
They'll kiss and make up
Lovers always do

Girls will be girls, boys will be boys
One day they're lovers
