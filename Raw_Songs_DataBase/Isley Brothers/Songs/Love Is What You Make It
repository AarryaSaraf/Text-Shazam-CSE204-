Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it

Give love a chance girl
You're still young
You still got time
Handle it with kid gloves girl
You gotta treat love kind

Love is what you make it baby
It's what you make it
Love is what you make it baby
It's what you make it

Always trust each other
Be true to one another
It's a great, great pleasure
When you're doing things together

All though thick and thin
Stay together till the end
Take it for what it's worth
It's the greatest thing on earth

Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
Love is what you make it
