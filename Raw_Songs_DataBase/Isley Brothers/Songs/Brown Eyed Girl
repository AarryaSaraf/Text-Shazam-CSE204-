Wished I could sing you
Sing you the song I sang once
Brown eyed girl, if you could deal with it, baby
I would girl, sing it all night
You want a lover
You need not look no further than my shadow
Time passes slowly here without you, baby
Nothing's new
Here in the darkness all is still
Needing you near me, if you will
Brown eyed girl
Brown eyed girl
Brown eyed girl
Know I just don't have
Just don't have the (Incomprehensible)
Wish that I
Well, well, sometimes I wish that I
Wished I could tell you, tell you the thoughts
Tell you the thoughts that I'm thinking
Brown eyed girl, if I could deal with it
Baby, I would tell it all now
Been writing you letter that unfolds
Telling you secrets of my soul
Brown eyed girl
Brown eyed girl
Brown eyed girl
