Oh yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm oh, I'm so, so sorry baby
Oh, yes sorry

Well hey, and if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world
And if you did was she crying, crying?

Hey, if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry, tell her I need my baby
Won't you, won't you please tell her that I love
I still love her? Oh, yes I do

Look in here, I woke up this morning
And I realized what I had done
And I stood alone in the cold gray dawn
Knew I lost my morning sun

Oh yeah, I lost my head and said something
Now in this morning all of the heartache brings
I was lying and I, I couldn't see her
And I let this little fine thing walk away, walk away on me, yeah

And hey, if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world
And if you did
Just tell her I'm sorry, sorry I'm oh so sorry

And hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful girl
Oh, walked out on me, on me
Tell her I missed her, do it for me
Tell her I need, oh I need my baby

Won't, won't somebody, somebody tell I'm sorry? Sorry, yes I'm
Oh, I know I was wrong
Took me a long, long, long, long time
To see what I was doing here
Oh and she didn't say nothing

One of these days I gonna find my baby
So if you see me lookin'
Look, look, look, look, look, look, lookin'
Somebody help me, help me somebody

If you see this little fine thing
About that tall
Long, long, long black wavy hair y'all
That's my baby, yeah that's my baby
