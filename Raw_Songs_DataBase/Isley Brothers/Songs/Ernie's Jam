Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Listen, listen

I was born to sing this music yeah
My brother was born to play his guitar, yeah
The sweet melody sent straight down from heaven
And oh, now you know, now you know who we are

Lord, go out and find your star
Whatever it is, listen
Try and find, find your star
Find out who you are
