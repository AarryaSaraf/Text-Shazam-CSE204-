Woah, baby
You got me holding on
Oh, baby
You got me holding on
Sometimes I can't move without you (You got me holding on)
Yeah (You got me holding on)
I wanna tell you it ain't no groove without you (You got me holding on)
You keep me holding on (You got me holding on)

Listen, baby
Your love is really strong
Oh, listen, baby
It lasts, it lasts so long
I can't move
I said, I can't move
Baby, baby, it ain't no groove
Oh, ain't no groove
Hit me!

Baby
I don't know what I'm gonna do
How will I get along
If it wasn't for you?
Baby (You got me holding on)
Girl, you got me holding on (You got me holding on)
Oh, baby (You got me holding on)
You keep me holding on (You got me holding on)
Yeah, baby
Ooh ooh

Yeah, baby
Mmm, yeah, baby
Wanna say it one more time, now, now, baby
Oh, hit me bad, now
No, oh, baby
So right
