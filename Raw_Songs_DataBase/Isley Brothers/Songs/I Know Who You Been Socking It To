I know who
Who you been socking it to
If you don't tell on me
I won't tell on you

I know who
Who you been socking it to
If you don't tell on me
Girl I won't tell on you

Don't worry bout me talking
Girl I'm cool 
I'm quiet
And come to think about it
I got a-something on the side

It's nobody's business
Girl what you do
Remember what I'm saying
Is between me and you

Girl I know who
Who you been socking it to
If you don't tell on me
I won't tell on you

I know who
Who you been socking it to
No doubt about it
Girl you better believe that I do

Hey
Alright
Better watch it baby

I know who
Who you been socking it to
If you don't tell on me
I won't tell on you

I know who
Who you been socking it to
No doubt about it
Girl you better believe that I do

I saw you last night
OverÂ ????
You saw your old man coming
And you ducked back in the alley

When you stayed in the alley
I stayed behind a tree
Oh I saw you baby
But you didn't see me

That's why I know who
Oh who you been socking it to
No doubt about it
Girl you better believe that I do

I know who
Who you been giving it to
No doubt about it
Girl you better believe that I do
