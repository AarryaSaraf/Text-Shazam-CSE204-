Tell me it is just a rumor, baby
Ooh baby

Another day is passing by
And here I sit in sorrow (Sorrow)
Tears streamin' from my eyes
I'm afraid to face tomorrow ('Morrow)
The things I hear from my friends
Tryin' to make me see (See)
Your love is gone
You're movin' on
Soon be leaving me

So, tell me it's just a rumor, baby
(Tell me it is just a rumor, love)
Ooh babe

They say you've found another love
You don't need me any longer (Longer)
It may be pride I feel inside
'Cause my love is growing stronger (Stronger)
I pay the cost of the love I lost
If I can't turn to you (You)
And here what seems to be the thing
That the people say is true

Come on and tell me, just a rumor, baby
(Tell me it is just a rumor, baby)
Tell me (Tell me it is just a rumor, love)
Oh oh

Listen to me, baby
I just need to conceal
The way I truly feel
I love you too much to hide it
There's no need to deny
I love you so (Even though)

I'm going insane from loving in vain
And you'll soon make a fool of me (Me)
But I can't accept a word I hear
Unless you say the same to me

Come on and tell me, it's just a rumor, baby
(Tell me it is just a rumor, baby)
Come on and tell me, yeah (Tell me it is just a rumor, love)

Ooh, ooh
Tell me it is just a rumor, baby
Come on and tell me it's just a rumor, baby
Oh no, tell me
(Tell me it is just a rumor, baby)
