Sunshine go away today
I don't feel much like dancing
Some man's gone, he's tried to run my life
He don't know what he's asking

He tells me I'd better get in line
Can't hear what he's saying
When I grow up I'm going to make it mine
But these aren't dues I been paying

How much does it cost?
I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost
I'll try it
He can't even run his own life
He can't even run his own life
I'll be damned if he'll run mine, sunshine

Sunshine go away today
I don't feel much like dancing
Some man's gone, he's tried to run my life
He don't know what he's asking

Working starts to make me wonder where
The fruits of what I do are going
He says in love and war all is fair
But he's got cards he ain't showing

How much does it cost?
I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost
I'll try it
He can't even run his own life
He can't even run his own life
I'll be damned if he'll run mine

Sunshine go away

Sunshine, come on back another day
I promise you I'll be singing
This old world, she's gonna turn around
Brand new bells'll be ringing
