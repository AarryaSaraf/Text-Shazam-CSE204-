Today is the day to say I do
Yes, I promise to be true

I pledge all my love to you always
Don't you know this ring
This ring is a symbol of my love
Grant us blessings from above oh, oh
Who cherish all the magic of our days

Oh Lord, oh Lord, here I stand
Golden chains around our hearts
Vow to death we'll never part
From this day as one we'll start our lives

Oh Lord, here I stand
With my heart out in my hand
Rich or poor, I am your man
I'm your lover and friend for life
Ooh

So much love, so much love, girl
So much love, girl, la, la, la, la
Today, today, today is the day to say I do
Yes, I promise to be true

I pledge all my love to you always
Don't you know this ring
This ring is a symbol of my love
Grant us blessings from above oh, oh
Who cherish all the magic of our days

And I can hear them when they play
Our Brazilian wedding song
