You'd been dreaming away
But it's time to leave love
And finally gone
Oh but don't get me wrong

And I'm drifting away
In the years we thought would never end
Let's pray they'll come again

Well, after all this time it took for us to grow
There's no sign of love right now you know
So you walk your way
Let me walk mine
You walk your way
Let me walk mine

Cuz I'm used to planning my days
But it's time I stopped including you
Oh won't you be blue

Cuz although I'm walking away
There's just one wish in mind to meet again
And we will my friend

Said after all this time it took for us to grow
There's no love between us, girl, you know
So you walk your way
Let me walk mine
You walk your way
And I'll walk mine

After all this time it took for us to grow
There's no love between us, girl, you know
So you walk your way
Let me walk mine
You walk your way
And I'll walk mine

And we'll meet again
We will my friend
And things will be much better then

You walk your way
Let me walk mine

You walk your way
Let me walk mine

You walk your way
Let me walk mine
