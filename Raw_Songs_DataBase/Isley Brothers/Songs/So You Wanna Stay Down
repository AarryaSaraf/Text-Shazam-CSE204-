So you wanna stay down you refuse to be happy, yeah
You wanna go back on your word 'cause it just got turned around
Oh keep on dreamin' hey baby
Nevertheless you can still be safe and sound

You wanna stay down you refuse to be happy
Oh, you wanna go back to yourfriends on the other side
But keep on dreamin' hey baby

Just remember that I love you
And I wouldn't have it any other way
Get a little stronger in your spirit
And all of your fears will go away

So you wanna stay down you refuse to be happy, yeah
To them you look roped and tied but you're still runnin' fast and free
Oh keep on dreamin' hey baby
Your motivation in somethin' hard to see

You wanna stay down you refuse to be happy
Well, whatever happens to you I know that you're one of a kind
Just keep on dreamin' hey baby

Sometimes you find disappointment, but never forget what you truly believe
People see you crawlin' but you're gettin' closer
Now ask yourself can you get off your knees
