I'm catching up on time I've lost
I'm making up all the time I've wasted
I'm catching up on time I've lost
Since your sweet, sweet love I've tasted

I was dancin' free and having fun
And I really didn't give a care
And you must agree that you might see me
Most any and everywhere

Once I saw you
(Saw you)
And I met you
(Met you)
Tried to call you
(Call you)
Had to get you
(Get you)

I'm catching up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
Catching up, baby
(I'm making up all the time I've wasted)
I'm catching up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
Oh, baby
(Since your sweet, sweet love I've tasted)

I was breaking hearts and taking names
And I wouldn't had stopped at that
But you made me see in spite of me
That that ain't where it's at

Yes, you saw me
(Saw me)
And you caught me
(Caught me)
Then you fought me
(Fought me)
But you taught me
(Taught me)

I'm catching up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
Catching up, baby
(I'm making up all the time I've wasted)
I'm catching on up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
(Since your sweet, sweet love I've tasted)
Oh, I'm catching up, I'm catching up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
(Since your sweet, sweet love I've tasted)

I bet your wondering why I'm hard to find
But  still exists
To procrastinate is an awful fate
'Cause you never head the list

What I'm sayin'
(Sayin')
So true
(So true)
I'm not playin'
(Playin')
Girl, I want you
(Want you)

I'm catching up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
Catching up, baby
(I'm making up all the time I've wasted)
I'm catching up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
Yeah, baby
(Since your sweet, sweet love I've tasted)
I'm catching on up
(I'm catching up on time I've lost)
Catching on up, baby
(Since your sweet, sweet love I've tasted)
I'm catchin up
