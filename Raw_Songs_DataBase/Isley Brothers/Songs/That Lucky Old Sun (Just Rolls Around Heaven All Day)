Dear Lord up above, can't you see I'm crying
Tears all in my eyes

Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun
Yeah

Up in the mornin' out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do now
But roll around heaven all day
Well fuss with my woman toil for my kids
Sweat 'til I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do now
But roll around heaven all day

Dear Lord up above, can't you see I'm crying
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver linin'
Lift me to paradise
Show me that river, take me across
Wash all my troubles away
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do now
But roll around heaven all day

Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun

Dear Lord up above, can't you see I'm crying
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver linin'
Take me to paradise
Show me that river, take me across
Wash all my troubles away
While that lucky old sun has nothin' to do now
But roll around heaven all day

Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun

Just roll around heaven all day

Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun
Lucky old sun
