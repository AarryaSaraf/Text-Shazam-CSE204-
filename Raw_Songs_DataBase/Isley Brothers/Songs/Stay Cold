Think
Upon that moment long ago
One breath away and there you will be
So young and carefree
Again you will see
That place in time, so gold

Steal
Away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather
Nothing can ever
And be in time, stay gold

But can it be
When we can see
So vividly
A memory?

And, yes, you will say
So must the day
Too, fade away
And leave a ray
Of sun so gold

Life
Is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined
All things that happen
Will age too old, though gold

Though
Though gold

Life
Is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined
All things, all things that happen
Will age too old, though gold

Though
Though gold

Stay gold
Stay gold
