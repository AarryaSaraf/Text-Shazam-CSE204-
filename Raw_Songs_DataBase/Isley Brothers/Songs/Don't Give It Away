Don't give it away
Don't give it away

Don't give it away
Don't give it away
Don't give it away
Don't give it away

Don't give it away
Don't give it away

Don't you let that boy
Tell you what to do
Girl you know he's only jiving
Trying to get next to you
Girl I said
Don't give it away

Don't give it away
Don't give it away

Girl you better save your lovin'
Save it for a rainy day
Girl you better listen to me
Listen to what I say
Girl I tell you now
Don't give it away
Don't give it away

Don't give it away
Don't give it away
Don't give your lovin'
Don't give it away
Good good lovin'
Don't give it away
Don't give your love
Don't give it away
Don't give you lovin'
Don't give it away
