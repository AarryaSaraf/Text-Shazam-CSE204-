I'm gonna call in a day, the company's gone and I'm all alone
All by myself and I'm meeting you, baby, yeah
Inside my mind now I realized shadows will fall
Oh, I wish you would call, call on me baby, yeah

I know I've found my dream
You're the key to my heart, my heart
You're the only one for me
I knew it right from the start, the start

Girl, you hold the key
The key to my heart, oh, my heart
You hold the key
The key to my heart, oh, my heart

There's love in your mind and love in your heart
You show it to me so naturally
And you know we're gonna be forever, baby, yeah

Sharin' our lives and sharin' our love, it's never too late
When you make a mistake
'Cause you know I'm lookin' out for you, baby, yeah

You know you are my dream
You're the key to my heart, my heart
You're the only one for me
You're the key to my heart, my heart

You hold the key
The key to my heart, my heart
You hold the key
The key to my heart, my heart
