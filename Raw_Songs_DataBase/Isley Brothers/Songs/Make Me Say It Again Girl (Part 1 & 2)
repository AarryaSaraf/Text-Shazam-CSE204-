Oh, I believe you are a rainbow
All the heaven I need to see
You're the promise everlasting
And where you are I hope to be

Make me say it again girl
Make me say it again girl
Make me say it again girl
You're all I need, oh yes you are, you're all...
You're all I need, oh yes you are, all I need

Whatever pain's inside, you make it better
You seem to realize when I'm concerned
You are the only one who goes through the changes
Givin' my life directions if I am turned

Make me say it again girl
Make me say it again girl
Make me say it again girl
You're all I need, oh yes you are, you're all...
You're all I need, oh yes you are, all I need

How am I worthy of love from an angel
Princess imperial of my soul
Don't really matter if you choose not to answer
Hopin' that what I've revealed you already know

Make me say it again girl
Make me say it again girl
Make me say it again girl
You're all I need, oh yes you are, you're all...
You're all I need, oh yes you are, all I need

Make me say it again girl
Make me say it again girl
Make me say it again girl
You're all I need, oh yes you are, you're all...
You're all I need, oh yes you are, all I need
