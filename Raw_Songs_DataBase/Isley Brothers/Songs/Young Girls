Young girls (Young girls), sophisticated
Young girls (Oh, young girls), you know what I need, yeah
They go where they wanna go
Boy, there ain't nothin' that they don't know
Laughing and feeling free
And they're fine as they wanna be

Talkin' 'bout those young girls (Young girls)
All over the world, yeah
Talkin' 'bout those young girls (Young girls)
Beautiful young girls

Oh, young girls (Young girls), lovely as a rose
Young girls (Oh, young girls) in their fashion clothes
They're fly as they wanna be
Walking around in designer jeans
They stay in the mirror all day
And at night they go out to play

Ooh (Young girls), beautiful young girls
Talkin' 'bout those young girls (Young girls)
Beautiful young girls
Oh, young girls (Young girls), so sophisticated
Oh, young girls (Oh, young girls), you know what I need, yeah

They stay on the telephone
Tryna find out what's going on
They stay in the mirror all day
And at night they go out to play

Talkin' 'bout those, ooh (Young girls), fine little
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know (Oh, young girls)
They're so fly, y'all, oh, oh, oh, young girls (Oh, young girls)
No, no, no, no, can't stop singin' 'bout those young girls (Oh, young girls)
Oh, oh, young girls
