There's so many things I want to say baby
So many words, oh (well well well)
Oh, you know what I mean?
(oh I know, I know)

Loving you is easy
Loving you is like breathing
Winter winter spring natural food
Ever loose ya
Loving you is righteous
Ever green light just
Shines bright (oh yeah)
When I'm with you
Ooh there's so much I want to say
Baby

 Said enough
 I just want you to know
 Said enough
 So much I want to say
 Said enough
 I love
 Said enough


Loving you, loving you is like
Sweeter than candy
Feels like I'm in heaven
Sweet like a morning kiss, oh
Loving you is so beautiful, baby
Loving you is food for my soul
Baby you know, you know, you know
Oh what I'm trying to say girl
I gotta let you know just what I feel

 Said enough

 Gotta let you know what I feel
 Gotta let you know my heart, baby
 Gotta let you know what's in my heart
 I want you to know just what I'm thinking
 Oh, you know what I'm thinking
 I want you to know
 Oh, I think I said
 I got to let you know
 Gotta let you know, you know babe
 Your love, your love
 My baby, my baby
 So so in love
 So good, you're so good baby
 Baby what I'm thinking, there's nothing
 Nothing in this world
 In this world that could take what we have away
 That would take what we have away
 Oh no no
 Nothing
 Nothing
 Nothing
 Nothing
 Nothing left to say
 Nothing left to say
 I said
 You said
 Nothing left to say
 No no no no no, nothing baby
Said enough
You said and I said and we said
Oh you said
All I need to know girl
That's all I need to know baby
No no no no no no no no


You know what I'm talking about
I might just shut my mouth
