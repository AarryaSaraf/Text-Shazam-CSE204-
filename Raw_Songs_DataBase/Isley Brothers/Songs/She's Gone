When she loved me, I was untrue to her
I did her wrong, I told her lies
I broke her heart, tore it apart
And I know, I know I hurt her deep down inside
But now, now I'm sorry
So very sorry
Oh Lord up above me, make happy leave me
I said I'm sorry
What else could I tell you? I'm sorry
I know, I know I hurt her deep down side
And I can hear all the people saying

(She's gone) Oh, oh, oh, oh
(She's gone) My best friend's telling me
(She's gone) Baby, baby, my baby, my baby
(She's gone)

I'm gonna find her, and knock on her door
Tell her that I'd never hurt her anymore
And if I can have her all for myself
Oh, do you believe that I don't want, just don't want nobody else
And I can hear all the people saying

(She's gone) Yes, she is, oh oh
(She's gone) My friends keep telling me
(She's gone)
