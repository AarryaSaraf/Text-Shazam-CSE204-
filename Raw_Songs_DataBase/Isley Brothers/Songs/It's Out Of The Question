It's out of the question
It's out of the question

Could not be another love as sweet as you
With lips that could kiss mine the way yours do
With a twinkle in her eyes for me alone
Now could I want another for my own?

It's out of the question
It's out of the question
I couldn't stop loving you, can't be done
The chance of that happening is a million to one

Could not be a song with a melody
That's beautiful as your voice sounds to me
Your total quality it can't be beat
Now could a melody be that sweet?

It's out of the question
It's out of the question
I couldn't stop loving you, can't be done
The chance of that happening is a million to one

I couldn't do it and I ain't gonna try
That would be a hard task for any guy
(What could I do? All he could do)
Is try to be grateful and always be faithful
(I couldn't stop loving you, can't be done
The chance of that happening is a million to one)

Oh, now could there be a vague possibility
That there's greater joy than what you bring to me?
Perhaps there is, but I don't think so
Could I ever, ever let you go?

It's out of the question
(You better believe it, baby)
It's out of the question
(Don't you know now)
I couldn't stop loving you, can't be done
The chance of that happening is a million to one
(Oh, don't you know now)
It's out of the question
(You better believe it, baby)
It's out of the question
It's out of the question
(No doubt about it)
It's out of the question
(Oh, don't you know now)
It's out of the question
