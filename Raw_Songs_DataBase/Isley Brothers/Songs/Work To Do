I'm taking care of business, baby can't you see
I gotta make it for you, and I gotta make it for me
Sometimes it may seem girl I'm neglecting you
I'd love to spend more time
But I got so many things to do

Ooh, I got work to do, I got work baby
I got a job yeah I got work to do,
Said I got work to do 

Oh I'm out here trying to make it, baby can't you see
It takes a lot of money to make, it let's talk truthfully
So keep your love light burning
And a little food hot in my plate
You might as well get used to me coming home a little late, oh 

Ooh, I got work to do, I got work baby
I got a job, yeah I got work to do
I got work to do, everybody's got work to do 

I'm taking care of business baby can't you see
I gotta make it for you,  I gotta make it for me
Don't wanna make you feel I'm neglecting you
I'd love to spend more time, oh
But I got so many things to do
