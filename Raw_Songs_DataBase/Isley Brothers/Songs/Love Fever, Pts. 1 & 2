Shaking in my dreams
Take me to another scene
Midnight lovin' is what I plan
You've got the powers, baby, in your hand
You win, again, so keep dealin'
My turn, to burn, with the feelin'

Come on baby, talk about the reasons why
Tell me what you do to make me feel so high

(Love fever)
I got the
(Love fever)
I got the
(Love fever)
I got the
(Love fever)

Makin' hot love on the place
Real good feeling all over the place
C'mon, baby, we can make lovin' sweeter
I feel, you feel, love fever

Come on baby, talk about the reasons why
Tell me what you do to make me feel so high

Oh, I got the love fever
I got the, I got the, I got the

Love fever, love fever
Love fever, love fever
Love fever, love fever
Love fever, love fever
Love fever, love fever
Love fever, love fever
Love fever, love fever
Love fever, love fever
Love fever, love fever
Love fever, love fever
Love fever, love fever
Love fever, love fever
Love fever, love fever
Love fever, love fever
Love fever, love fever
Love fever, love fever
