"Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
"Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")

These are the words my baby spoke
As she bid her last goodbye
With tears in my eyes as she walked from my side
I sadly asked her why

She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
"Ooh, ooh, ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")

Now I was too busy, but that girl of mine
I'd buy her gifts from time to time
So sure this would satisfy, 'til she up and left me
With this reply

She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
Because, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")

I said, sweet thing, sweet thing, please don't leave
I'm so sorry I made you grieve
So confident pretty words would make her stay
But I heard her say as she walked away

She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
She said, "Ooh, ooh, just ain't enough love"
("Just ain't enough love")
