The night was clear
And the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down

I was standing on the corner
When I heard my bulldog bark
He was barking up at the two men
Who were gambling in the dark
It was Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw a seven
Billy swore that he threw eight, oh

Stagger Lee told Billy
I said don't you go with that
You done won all my money
And my brand new Stetson hat, oh
Stagger Lee went home
And he got his forty-four
He said "Don't nobody move
Just to I'm gonna pay that debt I owe"
Go on, Stagger Lee, get down now

Ah, Stagger Lee went to the barroom
And he stood by the barroom door
He said "Don't nobody move"
And he pulled his forty-four, oh oh
"Stagger Lee" cried Billy
"I said please don't take my life
I got me three little children
And a very sickly wife." Oh oh

Stagger Lee shot Billy
Oh, he shot that poor boy so bad
'Til the bullet went through Billy
And it broke the bartender's glass
Yeah, ah, Stagger Lee, go on now

Go Stagger Lee
Go Stagger Lee (Woo)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo) (Go on Stagger Lee)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo) (Go on Stagger Lee, yeah)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo)
Go Stagger Lee (Woo)
