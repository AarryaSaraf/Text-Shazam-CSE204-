Now I'm a guy who's fond of sweet things
Sweet things I adore
In coffee most take one or two lumps
But I use three or four

But since I kissed your sweet, sweet lips
Sugar ain't sweet no more
Your kiss was sweeter than any cup of coffee
I ever made before

You're little Miss Sweetness, you're little Miss Sweetness
The sweetest girl in the world

If ever a man had a sweet tooth
I have one indeed
I order cookies and cakes and malts and shakes
From the menus that I read

But all the cakes and shakes and malts I've bought
Put together don't exceed
The sweetness in just one of your kisses
Baby, you're the one I need

You're little Miss Sweetness, you're little Miss Sweetness
The sweetest girl in the world

Ooh yeah, now listen to me you sweet thing
Hear what I have to say
If ever you need somebody
Send for me without delay

But do one thing for me
Don't ever go out on a rainy day
'Cause if it's true that rain melts sugar
You will surely melt away

You're little Miss Sweetness, you're little Miss Sweetness
The sweetest girl in the world, oh yeah
The sweetest girl in the world, oh sweetest girl
