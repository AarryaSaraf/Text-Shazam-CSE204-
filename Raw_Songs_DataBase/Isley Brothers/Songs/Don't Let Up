Time will tell if you break it down, you'll understand
I can't change my yesterday, it's out of my hands
But there's always tomorrow coming down the bend
Don't let up, I got a feeling, I better try again

(Don't you let up) Don't let up, baby
Ah yeah, I'd like to see
(Don't you let up) Love taking over everywhere
That's how it's gonna be

Well, I look inside my crystal, I don't see a thing
You can't say what tomorrow is gonna bring
But I still see the sunlight shining through the rain
Don't let up, I got a feeling, I'm still in the game

(Don't you let up) Don't let up, baby
Ah yeah, I wanna see
(Don't you let up) Love taking over everywhere
That's how it's gonna be

Time will tell if you break it down, you'll understand
I can't change my yesterdays, it's out of my hands
Sing
Don't you let up, baby, 'cause we've got the groove
I said don't you let up, baby, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Don't you let up, baby, 'cause we've got the groove
I said (Can you feel it?) don't you let up, baby
Ooh

(Don't you let up) Don't let up, baby
Ah yeah, I wanna see
(Don't you let up) Love taking over everywhere
That's how it's gonna be
(Don't you let up) Don't let up, baby
Ah yeah, I wanna to see
(Don't you let up) Love taking over everywhere
That's how it's gonna be

Don't you let up, baby, 'cause we've got the groove
I said don't you let up, baby, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Don't you let up, baby, 'cause we've got the groove
