Tin Soldiers and Nixon Coming
We're Finnaly on our own
This summer I hear the drumming
Four Dead in Ohio

Gotta Get Down to, Soldier are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her and found her dead on the ground
How can you run when you know?
Laa Laa Laa
Laa Laa Laa
Laa Laa Laa
Laa Laa Laa

Gotta Get Down to, Soldier are cutting us down
Should have been done long ago
What if you knew her and found her dead on the ground
How can you run when you know?
