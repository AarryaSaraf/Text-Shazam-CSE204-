I ain't givin' up no love this mornin'
I ain't givin' up love, no, I won't
She said, "I ain't givin' up no love this mornin'"
I ain't givin' up love at all

Covered up emotions
But I can't hide, oh, what it shows
Inside love double feelings
Runnin' hot and, oh, runnin' cold

No reason to make believe
You know how it's gonna be
Oh, this time around
Say just what you wanna say

But the feeling is gone away
'Cause you know what I'm feeling inside
I ain't givin' up no love this mornin'
I ain't givin' up love, no

She ain't givin' up no love this mornin'
She ain't givin' up love at all
Play the song
No reason to make believe

You know how it's gonna be
Oh, this time around
Say just what you wanna say
But the feeling is gone away

'Cause you know what I'm feelin' inside
I ain't givin' up no love this mornin'
I ain't givin' up love, no

She ain't givin' up no love this mornin'
She ain't givin' up no love at all
