A love gone bad is a heartbreaking pain
Like a chilling cold in the midst of spring
That last goodbye brings a flow of tears
Oh, it hurts to lose someone you held dear

Might as well kiss love goodbye, dry my eyes
She don't love me no more
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)
She don't need me no more
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)

I kissed her cheek, and sadly walked away
The words haunted me every step of the way
Wondering "Can I go on?" without her affections
As I slowly walk in some strange direction

Wondering "What am I gonna do? Where can I go?"
She don't love me no more
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)
She don't need me no more
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)

Simply I ask, give our love another chance
But she said our love is in the past
The words kept ringing in my ear
I cannot believe it, you told me, my dear

But she turned and slowly walked away, and I could hear her say
There's no love left, now I'm all by myself
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)
There's no love left, now I'm all by myself
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)

'Cause she don't love me no more
She don't need me no more
Oh, I'm all by myself now
(Bye-bye, baby, baby bye-bye)
She don't love me no more
(Bye-bye, baby, baby, bye-bye)

I might as well kiss love goodbye, dry my eyes
'Cause she don't love me no more
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)
She don't need me no more
(There's no love left, I'm all upset)

There's no love left, now I'm all by myself
'Cause she don't need me no more
She don't love me no more
(Bye-bye, baby, baby, bye-bye)
She don't need me no more
(Bye-bye, baby, baby, bye-bye)
All by myself now
(Bye-bye, baby, baby, bye-bye)
