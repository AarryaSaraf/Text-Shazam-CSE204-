Holding back the years,
Thinking of the fear Ive had for so long.
When somebody hears,
Listen to the fear thats gone.
Strangled by the wishes of father,
Hoping for the arm of mother,
Get to me sooner or later,

Nothing ever could, yeah.
I'll keep holding on,

Holding back the years,
Chance for me to escape from all I know.
Holding back the tears.
Theres nothing here has grown.
Ive wasted all my tears,
Wasted all those years.
Nothing had the chance to be good,
Nothing ever could, yeah.

I'll keep holding on,
I'll keep holding on,
I'll keep holding on,
I'll keep holding on
So tight.

I've wasted all my tears,
Wasted all those years.
Nothing had the chance to be good,
Nothing ever could, yeah.

I'll keep holding on,
I'll keep holding on,
I'll keep holding on,
I'll keep holding on
So tight.
