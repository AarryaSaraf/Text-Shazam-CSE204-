Climbin' up the ladder
I keep pushin' and I'm bound to know
Climbin' climbin' the ladder
Though it be shakin'
Ain't it up that I gotta go?

Keep me in the backroads
Why should I stay down?
I keep tryin', tryin' my best now baby
To reach that solid ground

Ain't nothin' wrong baby, ain't nothin' wrong in believin' in a dream
Ain't nothin' wrong baby, ain't nothin' wrong though the evidence unseen

Climbin' up the ladder
I keep pushin' and I'm bound to know
Climbin' climbin' up the ladder
Though it be shakin'
Ain't it up that I gotta go?

Reach out for the wisdom
Touchin' it every day
I keep reachin' for my next step baby
I keep hopin' that I find a way

Ain't nothin' wrong baby, ain't nothin' wrong in believin' in a dream
Ain't nothin' wrong baby, ain't nothin' wrong though the evidence unseen

Climbin' up the ladder
I keep pushin' and I'm bound to know
Climbin' climbin' up the ladder
Though it be shakin'
Ain't it up that I gotta go?

Seekin' satisfaction
Doubt that I believe?
But don't try me try my faith now baby
I said daniel's stopped the mouths of beasts!

Ain't nothin' wrong baby, ain't nothin' wrong in believin' in a dream
Ain't nothin' wrong baby, ain't nothin' wrong though the evidence unseen
