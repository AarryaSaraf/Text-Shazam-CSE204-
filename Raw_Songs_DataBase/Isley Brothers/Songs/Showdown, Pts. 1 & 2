Who's to blame
Whats his name?
Where's he from?
Is that my range hes drivin...
Tell me whats he got that I ain't got alot of
Besides who is he to lay in the covers of my home
Oooooo! my home

Shes nothing like my mother
God rest her soul ooooooo
Took her of these streets gave her everything
I was the one that belived in all of her dreams and she did me wrong
So prepare yourself..

Somebodys been foolin around in my home, wearin my clothes, drivin my car
God help me

Somebodys been foolin around in my home, wearin my clothes, drivin my car
Its on
Now first things first
Where's this cat from
