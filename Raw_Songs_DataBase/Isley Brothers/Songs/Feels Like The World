Feels like the world yeah
Is closing in on me
Feels like the world
Closing in on me

Helplessly I stand (I stand)
Watching love walk away (away)
Nothing I can do (do)
Nothing I can say (say)

Feels feels feels like the world
Closing in on me
Oh it feels like the world 
Closing in on
Closing on me now

I'm in bad shape (bad shape)
Since you been gone girl (gone)
I stare (I stare)
I stare out the window
Cry all night long (long)

Oh it feels like the world
Closing
Closing in on
Closing in on me

Feels
It feels like the world
Is closing
Closing in on me
