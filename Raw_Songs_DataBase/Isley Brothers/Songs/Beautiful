Whoa-ho, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh, ooh
Oh, listen, baby, ooh

There's not a day that goes by
I don't remind myself I'm the luckiest man alive
And it's because of what I found the day I met you, girl
The day I saw you smile, the day you turned my world upside down

You're my prize, you make my life, ooh
You're the truth (And I wanna tell you something else)
Just in case (You forget) how I feel (I can't fake it)
'Cause it's real
(Ooh, I had the finest cars, the biggest star but I tell you)

It's nothing like a beautiful woman (There's one thing that I know)
Who's always there to hold you down (You're so beautiful, baby, yeah)
It's nothing like a beautiful woman (I don't ever want you to go, yeah)
Someone to build your world around (Ooh-hoo)

Oh, don't think that I don't miss you when I leave to do a show
You may not be right there with me, but I keep you where it counts the most
(In my heart, in my soul) Yeah
(In my whole damn body from my head down to my toes)
Oh, ho, oh, you're the greatest, I wanna say this

You're my prize, you make my life, ooh
You're the truth (And I wanna tell you something)
Just in case (You forget) how I feel (I can't fake it)
'Cause it's real
(Oh, I've seen the most beautiful island, the most beautiful diamond, but I tell you)

It's nothing like a beautiful woman (There's one thing that I know)
Who's always there to hold you down (Ooh, you're so beautiful)
It's nothing like a beautiful woman (Oh, oh, you know)
Someone to build your world around (You know, you know, oh)
It's nothing like a beautiful woman (There is nothing, nothing, yeah)
Who's always there to hold you down (I know it's nothing)
It's nothing like a beautiful woman (Hey)
Someone to build your world around

Ooh, I wanna build my world around you
Oh, I'm so glad I found you, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, there's nothing, nothing
