Like a ship
Lost on a stormy sea
I need your lovin', your lovin' arms
To rescue me

The sound of your sweet, sweet voice
Telling me that you're near
So desperately I'm wating
Don't let me drown dear

I got a lonely, lonely feeling
That you'll never come
Oh I guess I can't blame you
For I know the wrong I done

Save me
Give love another try
Save me
Don't, don't let true love die

My selfish pride
Made a fool of me
For years you gave your love
So tenderly

I call your name
Just to ease the pain
I push my pride aside
'Cause I want you back again

I got a lonely, lonely feeling
That you'll never come
Oh I guess I can't blame you
For I know the wrong I done

Save me
Give love another chance baby
Save me
Oh Save me

Why don't you
Why don't you
Why don't you
Save me

I'd feel better
I'd feel better
If you save me

Why don't you
Why don't you
Why don't you
Save me
Save me
Yeah
Save me
