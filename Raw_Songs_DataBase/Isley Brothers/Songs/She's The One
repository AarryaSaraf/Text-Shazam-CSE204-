She's the one (She's the one)
Yeah, yeah, she's the one (She's the one)

Oh, oh, and I know, I know she's the one
The woman made me, made me what I am today, yes, she did
And I know, I know she's the one
She helped me when I couldn't find my way
Ah, oh, oh, oh, she's the one
She picked me up when I was falling down
That's why I wanna tell y'all now that's why I love her so
And I'll never let, let her go
And ah, yeah

(She's the one, woo, she's the one)
She picked me up when I was falling down
(She's the one, woo, she's the one)
Yeah, yeah
(She's the one)
Make me feel so glad she's mine, she's mine, all mine
(Woo, she's the one)

Oh, oh, oh, and I know she's the one, she's the one, yeah
The woman put food, yes, she did
She put food in my mouth when I was hungry, yes, she did
And I'm not ashamed to say she's the one now, yeah, yeah, yeah
She put clothes, clothes on my back when I was raggedy
And it makes me wanna stand right up here and say it
And I know, and I know...
