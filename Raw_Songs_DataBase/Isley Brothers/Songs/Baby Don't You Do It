Well, baby don't you do it, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, don't do it babe
Don't break my heart, please don't do it babe
Don't break my heart

Well, I sacrifice to make you happy
Kept nothing for myself
Now you wanna leave me
For the love of someone else
My pride is all gone, whether right or wrong
I need you, baby, you'd better keep on keeping on

But I tried to do my best
Tried and tried to do my best
Baby don't you do it, don't break my heart
Please don't do it baby

Well, my biggest mistake was loving you too much
And letting you know
'Cause now you've got me where you want me
And you won't let me go
If my heart was made of glass, then you would surely see
Heartaches and misery you've been causing me
But I tried to do my best
Tried and tried to do my best

But I tried to do my best
Tried and tried to do my best
Baby don't you do it, don't break my heart
Please don't do it baby

Go down to the river and there I'll be
I'm gonna jump in, baby, if you don't see about me
Open up your eyes; can't you see I love you?
Open up your heart baby; can't you see I need you?
Can't go on without you; I'm no good without you
Life's no good without you, what I'm gonna do without you?
Hey, baby don't do it, oh, don't break my heart
Oh, don't you do it, don't break my heart
Life's no good without you
What I'm gonna do without you?
Can't go on without you
Life's no good without you
Oh, don't do it baby, yeah
Hey, don't you do it
