Dancin' on the sands of time
Up and down your mind you climb
Frustration is the way you feel
And wondering if it's all for real

My people of today (yeah, yeah)
People of today (yeah, yeah)
Devotion is the way (yeah, yeah)
People of today (yeah, yeah)

My world is fine, it's so good for me
My world is fine, it's where I want to be
My world is fine, are you down with me
My world is fine, lay it on the line

Spinnin' round and feelin' free
Livin' in a fantasy
Are you seein' all there is to see
Are you able to relate to me

My people of today (yeah, yeah)
People of today (yeah, yeah)
Devotion is the way (yeah, yeah)
People of today (yeah, yeah)

My world is fine, it's so good for me
My world is fine, it's where I want to be
My world is fine, are you down with me
My world is fine, lay it on the line

Break down that horizon line
Discovering your piece of mind
The children plant a brand new seed
To touch the things we fail to reach

My people of today (yeah, yeah)
People of today (yeah, yeah)
Devotion is the way (yeah, yeah)
People of today (yeah, yeah)

My world is fine, it's so good for me
My world is fine, it's where I want to be
My world is fine, are you down with me
My world is fine, lay it on the line

Talkin' about the people of today
Talkin' about the people games people play
