Standing in the rain
Teardrops begin to fall
I could feel your pain
Raindrops just hide it all

He said I didn't need you, made you cry
You turned and walked away
I was there again with my arms open wide
Didn't you hear me say?

(Come to me)
I'll show you better ways
(Come to me)
I love you, girl

(Come to me)
Oh, babe
(Come to me)

Wanting you to hold
I chased your love through the storm
Out of self control
The thought was enough to keep me warm

Girl, I really need you
I'm yours forever and a day
It's clear for you to see
So don't ignore your heart when I say

(Come to me)
I'll show you better ways
(Come to me)
Oh, I love you, girl

(Come to me)
Please, babe
(Come to me)
Come to me

Take a chance, don't you be afraid
Let tonight persuade you to come to me
Let it go, what's over now
I'll never let you down, come to me

(Come to me)
(Come to me)
Oh, my arms are open wide
Please stand by my side

(Come to me)
Please come to me, baby
(Come to me)
I need to really love you, girl

(Come to me)
(Come to me)
Oh, I'll chase your love through the storm
Please, girl, won't you keep me warm?

(Come to me)
Please come to me, baby
(Come to me)
I need to really love you, girl

(Come to me)
Please come to me, baby
(Come to me)
I need to really love you, girl

Come to me
Come to me
