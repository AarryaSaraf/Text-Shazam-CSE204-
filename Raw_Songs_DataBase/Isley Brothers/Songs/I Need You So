I wandered around in a daze
Not knowing just what to do
When all at once, the moon came out
And there in the light stood you

I need you so
I'll never let you go
So please say you need me, too
Girl, I'm so hung up on you
I need, I love you so

Well, love
Love is strange and it's simple
It's easy to fall into
So, if I should fall, no one would blame me
For falling in love with you

I need you so
I'll never let you go
So please say you need me, too
Girl, I'm so hung up on you
I need you so

And now, darling
More than ever before
I find myself completely lost in you

Ooh, I love you
I want you
I need you

I love you (I love you)
Girl, I want you (I want you)
I need you

I love you (I love you)
Girl, I want you (I want you)
I need you
Oh
