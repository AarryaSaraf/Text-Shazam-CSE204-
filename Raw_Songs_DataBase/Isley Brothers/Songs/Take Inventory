Ooh, I want all you fellas to take good inventory
Listen to my story:

"If you give true love
And I know you do
Soon your woman
Will believe in you
So you can't be too sweet
I know you can't be too kind
She'll break your heart, boys
And control your minds"
(Listen to my story)
One thing I know now
And this is a fact (Take an inventory)
She'll be cryin'
And tryin' to take you back

No, good man
Don't go for it
Don't be a fool
Well, well, won't you tell her (Listen to my story)

To dry her eyes
And go away (Take an inventory)
But not too far, baby
You may want her back someday (Listen to my story)
And if this happens
She'll go by your rules (Take an inventory)
She'll do what you tell her
And you'll do what you wanna do

Alright, just sit back and be cool
(Listen to my story)
Alright
And she'll do what you tell her to do

Ooh
Well, well, well, well

Be sure to lie (Listen, listen, listen, listen)
And be sure to cheat (Listen, listen, listen, listen)
(Listen to my story)
Always keep that woman beggin'
At your feet
Don't be so loyal (Take it, take it, take it, take it)
And don't be so true (Take it, take it, take it, take it)
(Take an inventory)
'Cause if you are, boy
They'll run over you

Show who's the boss, now (Listen, listen, listen, listen)
And show who's the king (Listen, listen, listen, listen)
(Listen to my story)
Show you can be cold, now
And you can be mean
Alright (Take it, take it, take it, take it)
Tell me how you like my story (Take it, take it, take it, take it)
(Take an inventory)

Ah, did you take good inventory? (Take an inventory)
If you have, then it's good, now (Take an inventory)
Oh, but if you haven't, you should (Take an inventory)
Ha, tell me how you like my story (Take an inventory)
Did you take good inventory? (Take an inventory)
Ow, if you haven't, you should, babe (Take an inventory)
Well, if you have, then it's good (Take an inventory)
