What's as big as a mountain and grows bigger everyday
Until it's taller than the sky
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie

What can change happy lovers into hurt and lonely souls
Just as we are, you and I
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie

Gossip can be an ugly thing, tearing love like I was apart
How could you believe I was untrue, when I love you with all my heart

Darling, one silly rumor coming from two liar lips
Made you wanna say goodbye
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie

What's as big as a mountain and grows bigger everyday
Until its taller than the sky
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie

What can change happy lovers into hurt and lonely souls
Just as we are, you and I
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie

Gossip can be an ugly thing, tearing love like I was apart
How could you believe I was untrue, when I love you with all my heart

Darling, one silly rumor coming from two liar lips
Made you wanna say goodbye
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie
It's a monster, a monster
A monster lie
