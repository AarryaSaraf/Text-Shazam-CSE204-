This next song is a combination of
Two songs and they are both children's songs
And they are all about
The beauty of children and it can't be said too much in words
Our children are so very beautiful
They lack all our sophistication and all
Of our fear until they just plain beautiful

Murphy limo
Sweet-est little fellow
Everybody knows
Don't know what to call him
But he is mighty like a rose
Looking at his Mammy
Rise so shiny blue
Til it seems like heaven
Is climbing close to you
