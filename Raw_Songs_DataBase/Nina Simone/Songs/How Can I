How can I help but love you
Help but want you
Help but need you
How can I hide this feeling
Feeling as I do

How can I make you see me
Make you to me
Take you to me
And I
How can I pic the secret
It's so plan to see

Be mine, please be mine, my darling
I can't ask nothing more
Be mine, please be mine, my darling
You're the one I adore

How can I help but love you
Help but want you
Help but need you
I have one wish
I'm wishing only love me too

How can I make you see me
Wake you to me
Take you to me and I
How can I keep the secret
It's so plan to see

So how can I help but love you
Help but want you
Help but need you
I have one wish
I'm wishing only love me too

How can I help but love you
How can I help but want you
How can I help but need you
