I can't explain the fallin' rain
Say when the sun will shine again
I only know I want your kiss
Of this I'm sure

I never miss the moon's bright light
The magic of a starry night
It's just your lovin' arms I miss
Of this I'm sure

(Come back, come back,
Come back to my heart)
Oh oh, what good am I without you?
(I cry, and cry
'Cause we are apart)
I need you so,
Darling I do

Uncertain as some things can be
I know that you belong to me
I also know that we'll endure
Of this I'm sure
