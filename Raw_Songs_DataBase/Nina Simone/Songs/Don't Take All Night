Don't take all night
To tell me that you love me
Don't take all night
To tell me you care

Don't you know I have the right
To know if you want me
Tell me now
Take my love
Forever to share

Don't take all night
Now don't keep me waiting
Well I like to know
The way that you feel

Oh don't take all night
I'm anxious to know dear
Let your love
With a kiss
Let it be sealed

Everyday
I love you more and more
This is the moment
That I've been waiting for

Daddy please, don't take all night
To tell me that you love me
Oh don't take all night
To tell me you care

Daddy please, don't take all night
I want you to hold me
Tell me now
Take my love
Forever to share

Daddy take my love
Take it now
Forever to share
