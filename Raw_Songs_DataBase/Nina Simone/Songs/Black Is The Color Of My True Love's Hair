Black is the color of my true love's hair
Black is the color of my love, so fair
Black is her body, so firm, so bold
Black is her beauty, her soul of gold

I carry my love in my heart
Every... everywhere
And no matter where I go
She is always there

I remember how she came to me
In a vision of my mind
I remember how she said to me:
"Don't ever look behind"
She said: "Look ahead", and I would see
Someone always loving me...

Her picture is painted in my memory
Without a color of despair
And no matter where I go
She is always there
