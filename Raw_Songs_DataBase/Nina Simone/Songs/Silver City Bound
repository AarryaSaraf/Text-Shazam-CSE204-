Yeah...
This is a song... was sung by leadbelly and it was written for...his friend...
He had a friend named blind lemon...
And they used to ride back and forth on a train from somewhere to texas...
And I learned this tune from a record
I heard by him

Silver city bound I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna meet blind lemon gonna ride on down
Silver city bound I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna meet blind lemon gonna ride on down

Take me by the hand oh babe
And lead me to the promises land
Take me by the hand oh babe

And lead me to the promised land

Silver city bound I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna meet blind lemon gonna ride on down

Take me by the hand oh babe
And lead me to the promises land
Take me by the hand oh babe
And lead me to the promised land

I'm silver city bound I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna meet blind lemon gonna ride on down

Silver city bound I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm silver city bound
I'm gonna meet blind lemon gonna ride on down
