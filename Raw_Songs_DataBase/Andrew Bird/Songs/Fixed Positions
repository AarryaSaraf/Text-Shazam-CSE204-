When your position remains fixed, my dear
Results can be mixed, I fear
There's a stasis
No new ideas and no new faces
Misadventures and far-flung places
Don't get me wrong, it's not dull

But if you stay here long enough, I fear we'll always be this way
And if you're screwing up your face, oh, won't it always stay that way?
Always be this way
Will we always stay this way?

You know there really isn't much preventing
The way you see the world cementing
There's a stony creep in
Cradle to grave or forever weeping
Rounded on our sides, you're forever sleeping
Promise to resist until you die (Resist until you die)
Promise to resist until you die

An object set in motion (An object set in motion)
The arbiter of time (Arbiter of time)
The unexpressed emotion (Unexpressed emotion)
Capital crime (Capital crime)
So pick a random number (Pick a random number)
Making sure it's prime (Making sure it's prime)
Pick a random number between one and one-hundred-and-nine

Stay here long enough and you will always be this way
And when you're screwing up your face, oh, won't it always stay that way?
And when we're sheltering in place, oh, won't we always be this way?
Always be this way
Will we always stay this way? (Will we always stay this way? Will we always stay this way?)
Will we always stay this way? (Will we always stay this way? Will we always stay this way?)
Will we always be this way? (Will we always stay this way?)

When your position remains fixed
Results can be mixed
I fear there's a stasis
