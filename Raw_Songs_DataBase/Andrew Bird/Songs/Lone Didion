She's alone, she's alone, lone, lone Didion
She's alone, she's alone, lone, lone Didion
Get along, get along without her
Get along, get along without him
Lone Didion

Every Saturday night, she came in with him
Table six in the back, tall beer and a gin
Now she comes in alone, lone Didion
If he lies, says he'll keep you safer than him
And he leaves and he makes you pay for your gin
Now she comes in alone, lone Didion

Put the top down, skip town, yellow Corvette
Up to the East Bay, trees sway, never get wet
Gonna head for the hills of Montana
Gotta get away from these mad Santa Anas
Lone Didion

Every Saturday night, she came in with him
Table six in the back, tall beer and a gin
Now she comes in alone, lone Didion
And he lies, says he'll keep you safer
And he leaves and he makes you pay for
Now she comes in alone, lone Didion
