One just reached for her gun
Two's slumped in the corner
Three is making a plea for someone to adore her
Five is buried alive
Six is out on the street throwing bricks now
Seven, let's just skip over seven, shall we and get to eight

Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, no
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

Since my days are numbered, I am unencumbered by fate
Don't you look so certain until you lay your burden down

Nine is waiting to shine, ten is stuck at the border
Eleven's my two-legged brethren, twelve is a hoarder
Now, thirteen just might be the worst
Fourteen has a secret and it's ready to burst
Now fifteen goes with the ice queen into the foyer

Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh, oh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

I sense my days are numbered, I am unencumbered by fate, fate
Don't you look so certain until you lay your burden down
Since my days are numbered, I feel unencumbered by fate
Don't you look so certain 'til you lay your burden down
