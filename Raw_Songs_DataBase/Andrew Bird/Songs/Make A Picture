Oh, I don't wanna ride on your shoulders
And put you in the hospital
I just wanna roll away boulders
That they said was impossible
'Cause don't you know that I'm
An irrepressible optimist working with a fatal flaw
Running in the streets like feral cats
Will be hard to mistake any and raise a paw

Tell us what you think you saw
What you think you saw
Tell us what you think you saw

Make a picture
Make it snappy
Make a picture
Don't look so happy

All those scowling faces
All those furrowed brows
All those burned-out cases
Make 'em take a bow (make 'em take a bow)
About some smiling faces
Come on and show us how
Never mind the braces
Love you anyhow
We love you anyhow

I don't wanna hear what's impossible
Falling with the Shepard's tone
And if we're ever gonna get out of this hospital
You will never sleep alone
Listen to the cries of the wounded metropolis
Denizens on tender hooks
Listen to the cries of the pliable populace
Giving us the dirty looks

They're giving us the dirty looks
Dirty looks now
They're giving us the dirty looks

Make a picture
Make it snappy
Make a picture
Don't look so happy

All those scowling faces
All those furrowed brows
All those burned-out cases
Make 'em take a bow (make 'em take a bow)
About some smiling faces
Come on and show us how
Never mind the braces
Love you anyhow
We love you anyhow

Love you anyhow
Love you anyhow
You will never sleep alone
Love you anyhow
You will never sleep alone
