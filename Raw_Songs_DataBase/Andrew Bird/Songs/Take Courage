Night's falling, so take courage
that you're not alone, no you're not alone.
Night's falling, so take courage
that you're not alone, no you're not alone
Then these words become to crumble like the sidewalks
all around this crumby neighborhood.
And from the chalky Cliffs of Dover, I'd come over,
I'd start over if I could.

From the tropic of Cancer, to Capricorn, 
you so far from your sofa along.
Now you spin dirty laundry
You dream of the kind of love you knew the day you're born

Night's falling, so take courage
that you're not alone, no you're not alone.
Night's falling, so take courage
that you're not alone, no you're not alone.

Night's falling, night's falling, 
but you're not alone, no you're not alone.

You swallow far from home
It's how you find your room

Though my words begin to crumble like the sidewalks
all around this crumby neighborhood.

And from these chalky Cliffs of Dover, I'd come over
I'd start over if I could.

Night's falling, night's falling, 
but you're not alone, no you're not alone.
Night's falling, night's falling,
but you're not alone, no you're not alone. 
Take courage, take courage, 
that you're not along, no you're not alone.

Night's falling, night's falling, 
but you're not alone, no you're not alone.
Take courage, take courage, 
that you're not along, no you're not alone.
