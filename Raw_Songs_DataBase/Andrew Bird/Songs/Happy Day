Some day
Some happy day
Some day I'll find
I live before I die some day
Oh Lord, some day

Some day
Some happy day
Some day I'll find
The one with eyes that say those words I cannot find

I hope I live before I die some day
Oh, some day
I hope there's tears of joy I cry
Some day
Lord, some day

Some day
Some happy day
Some day I'll find
The one with eyes that say those words I cannot find
