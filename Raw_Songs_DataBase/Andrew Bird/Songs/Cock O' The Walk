C'mon baby move over, I'm sittin' here tonight
C'mon baby move over, do the thing that's right
I can puff up my feathers, look real mean, be the old man that this here's scene.
I'm a struttin'-preenin'-bantam rooster looking for a fight,
Hold on there partner, my hat just ain't on right
Just a minute there govn'r while I set it right
It's a half turn left a half turn right, this old thing used to be bright white
I'm a struttin'-preenin'-bantam rooster looking for a fight.
I went on down to sports bar town to put mother hen in a fright
Took the 450 Addison to see pulaski at night
it's one for the money, two for the jack, three for the joe you've got to pay back
I'm a struttin'-preenin'-bantam rooster looking for a fight.
I think that might makes right.
