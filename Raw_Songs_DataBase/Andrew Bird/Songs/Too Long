Too long you waited too long to come home
Now your daddy don't want you no more
Too long you don't belong here anymore
So quit your knock-knocking at my door

You left me sweet mamma for no good reason at all
And now there's another mule kicking in the same old stall
Too long you waited too long to come home
Now your daddy don't want you no more
