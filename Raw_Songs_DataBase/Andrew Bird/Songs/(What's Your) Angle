I've got a new-found fangled fandango tango angle
and it keeps things curious yes, and it makes folks furious

it takes two part tango and a little tingle tangle
and two orangutans like me and you

I used to think that you were a tomboy
hair like a bird's nest, clothes so shoddy
then I found that you were arhomboid
not an oblesque bone in your body

So don't mess around with my extemporangle fangle
everybody's entitled to a little existenstialrangle fangle bang
