Just think of the lives you could swap with your own
While you're selling you're coats, you're sewing your own
And though it's not the easy way, 
sometimes we've got to pay to play
with finger paints and macromay
It's time we asked a see and say

Could you bring a different nomenclature?
Now the colors have bled to gray.
To ones that don't take distant nature.

Our nomenclature's washin away.
Washin Away.
Our nomenclature's washin away.
Washin away.

But did it carry you away?
Carry you all away?

Did it carry you away?
Carie you all away
Nomenclature's washin away
It's washing us all away
Nomenclature's washin away
It's washing us all away
