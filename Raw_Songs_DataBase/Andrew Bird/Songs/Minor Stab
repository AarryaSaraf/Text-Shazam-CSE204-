Somepeople was an angry thin-skinned man
Couldn't get along with his one man band
Quarter stick rocket and nails in his pocket
And a crying shame Somepeople is his name
Poor Old Pierrot Somepeople
What an unfortunate name
Some people have the low down notion that he is the one to blame
He used to take the train from old Montparnasse to Madrid
Hustles up a little under fifty quid
Underneath the shell is an angry fire
But who's the first to jump on the pyre
Poor Old Pierrot Somepeople
What an unfortunate name
Some people have the low down notion he is the one to blame.
Some people like to bake a honey coiled ham
Some people like to roast a leg of lamb
Some people have a complicated coat to mend
We'll all be milking goats in the end
