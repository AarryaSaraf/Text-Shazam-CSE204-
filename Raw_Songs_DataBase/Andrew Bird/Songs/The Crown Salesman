Bring me your trembling masses
Sunday best
Tiptoe around the elephant
She needs her rest

I am your crown salesman
I'm the one who's running this job
Call me your crown salesman
I've got your list

A little bit Illuminati
A little Land of the Lost
Why do you wanna complicate it?
Why do you wanna complicate it?

I am your crown salesman
I'm the one who's running this job
Call me your crown salesman
I got your list
