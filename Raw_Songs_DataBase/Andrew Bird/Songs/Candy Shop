Well piece by piece, and nail by nail
It'll all come down some day before the fires of hell

You let me in your house
You let me in your house
You let me in your house with a hammer
Set to tile or set to stone
Tit for tat and bone for bone
I'm going to set fire to your glamor

Well listen now, rock that candy shop
Rock that candy shop
Rock that candy shop, set it on fire
Run away and watch it burn
I've got to set fire to your glamor

Rock that candy shop, rock that candy shop
Rock that candy shop, set it on fire
Run away, watch it burn
Smell the ashes in the air
Of this silly game we're sure to tire

Well, you let me in your house
You let me in your house (With your mama)
You let me in your house with a hammer
Set to tile or set to stone
Tit for tat and bone for bone
I'm going to set fire to your glamor
Yes, to your glamor
Yes, little mama, to your glamor
To your glamor
Let it rock
Listen to me now, let it rock, let it rock, now
Rock that candy shop
