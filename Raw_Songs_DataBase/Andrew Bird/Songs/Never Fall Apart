Oh, dear friend, won't you speak to me?
I'm down here, down on bended knee
Speak on telephone
Soft, dulcet tone
And I will listen

Am I or am I not your love?
When push comes to shove

"La-la-la," go the singing bones
From the shaky thrones

And never fall apart again
And never fall, fall apart

Never fall apart again
And never fall, fall apart

Oh, on the boulevard
Twisting broken burning shards
Walk softly with empty hand
Strike up the band

And never fall apart again
And never fall, fall apart
And never fall apart (Again)
And never fall, fall apart
And never fall apart again
And never fall, fall apart
