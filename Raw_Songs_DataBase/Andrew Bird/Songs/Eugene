Studies have shown that we, like sheep, are prone
To sure fatal doses of malcontent through osmosis
But don't be sympathetic, just pass the anaesthetic
'Cuz sheep are benign and on the young we will dine

Burn her pale blue shroud, and tread on her bones
The din of the boys club crowd, reveals we've always been clones
Oh this being true you know there's more than just two
In the cards are four aces so turn and shoot at twelve paces

Studies have shown that we like sheep are prone
To sure fatal doses of malcontent through osmosis
But don't be sympathetic, just pass the antisthetic
'Cuz sheep are benign and on the young we will dine

Burn her pale blue shroud, and tread on her bones
The din of the boys club crowd, reveals we've always been clones
Oh this being true you know there's more than just two
So tie up your laces for the gene pool race of races
