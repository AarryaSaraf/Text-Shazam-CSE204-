Now don't you mind people grinnin' in your face.
Now don't you mind people grinnin' in your face.
Just bear this in mind
A true friend is hard to find.
Don't you mind people grinnin' in your face.

You know your mother's gonna talk about you.
Your sisters and your brothers too
No matter how you try to live
You know they'll talk about you still.

So bear this in mind
A true friend is hard to find.
Don't you mind people grinnin' in your face.
