Though I've never been to Venezuela, 
But everything's fine south of the Rust Belt line
I think I like it, yes those southern cats are really unique,
Tell me why does the grass always seem greener
I'm going to take a trip to New Orleans
Where nobody cares how you shop your wares, long as it sounds good
Yes, it's all about that spicy cuisine
Tell me, why does the grass always seem greener
Gonna skip this town and head on down to Louisiana
I'm gonna skip this town and head on down, take my advice
Folks up there will start a fight with a cold chunk of ice
Let's drink some mash and talk some trash till morning
Let's drink some mash and talk some trash till morning
This song's like a lost ship at sea that's the same as wandering
