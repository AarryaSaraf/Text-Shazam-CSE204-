All the snow has turned to water
Christmas days have come and gone
Broken toys and faded colors
All that's left to linger on

I hate graveyards and old pawn shops
For they always bring me tears
I can't forgive the way they rob me
Of my childhood souvenirs

Memories, they can't be boughten
Can't be won at carnivals for free
Well it took me years to get these souvenirs
And I don't know how they slipped away from me

Broken hearts and dirty windows
Make life difficult to see
That's why last night and this mornin'
Always look the same to me

I hate reading old love letters
For they always bring me tears
I can't forgive the way they rob me
Of my childhood souvenirs

Memories, they can't be boughten
Can't be won at carnivals for free
Well it took me years to get these souvenirs
And I don't know how they slipped away from me
