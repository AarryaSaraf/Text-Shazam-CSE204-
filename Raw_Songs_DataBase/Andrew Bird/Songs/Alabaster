Keep your lamp on
Keep your lamp on
Keep your lamp on

Night and the stars that hung all around us
Light the way to your door
Won't you pour me a glass of pure alabaster
Come, sit down by the fire

Days are growing short
Nights are growing longer
Gotta get much stronger
To make it through

True are these hearts that burn luminescent
Begging to invite you inside
Wide are the arms that long to hold you tight
In this sleepy embrace

Days are growing short
Nights are growing longer
You gotta get much stronger
To make it through

Night and the stars that hung all around us
Light the way to your door

Keep your lamp on
Keep your lamp on
Keep your lamp on
