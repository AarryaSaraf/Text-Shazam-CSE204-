I saw you last night
My, my, how indiscreet
Your self-destruction is so complete
And I know
Yeah I know
That she's goin' down slow

It was this morning that you phoned
You sound strung out, babe, but so high toned
And I know
Yeah I know
That she's goin' down slow

You're the article babe
The genuine thing
And when that guy comes by
With his diamond ring
It doesn't feel right
And you tell him so
So you buy your ticket home
And you're going down slow

Wait a minute
What's this?
We're losing altitude
Hand over fist
And she's goin' down fast
