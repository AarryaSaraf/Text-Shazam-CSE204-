In the salsify mains of what was thought but unsaid
all the calcified arithmatists were doing the math
And it would take a calculated blow to the head 
to light the eyes of all the harmless sociopaths

oh arm in arm we are the harmless sociopaths 
oh, arm in arm with all the harmless sociopaths
calcium mines are buried deep in your chest 
oh the calcium mines you buried deep in your chest.

Ooh,
you're deep in a mine
Ooh,
a calcium mine
o-o-oh

let's get out of here
past the atmosphere
squint your eyes and no one dies or goes to jail
past the silver bridge
oh the silver bridge wearing nothing but a one-sie and a veil.      

Ooh,
you're deep in a mine, o-o-oh
Ooh,
a calcium mine
oh-no-no

arm in arm we are the harmless sociopaths
oh arm in arm with all the harmless sociopaths
in the calcium mines buried deep in your chest
oh the calcium mines buried deep in your chest.

Ooh,
deep in a mine, oh-no
Ooh,
a calcium mine
oh-no

so let's get out of here 
past the atmosphere
squint your eyes and no one dies or goes to jail
past the silver bridge
oh the silver bridge wearing nothing but a one-sie and a veil.

oh-no
oh-no
oh-no
oh-no
