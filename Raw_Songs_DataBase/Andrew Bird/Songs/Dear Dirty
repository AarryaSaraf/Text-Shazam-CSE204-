Dear Dirty, I'm a man strong and 
And I live in a cave, using my blood to draw,blood to draw
And I live in a cave, 
Something I come up to, something I come up to
Something I come up to, using my blood to draw
the blood to draw animal,like the bull
Dear Dirty,
Then I go to find more things,
Go for walks to find things I, 
I can use to make the tools to kill
all these animals, or all these things
Dear Dirty
