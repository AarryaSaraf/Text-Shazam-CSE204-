Beekeeper sing of your frustration
In this litigious breeze
Of accidental pollination
In this era without bees

We keep breeding desperation
In this era of thieves
Who keep stealing respiration
From the tenderest of trees

This peculiar incantation
Sure you heard it before
Instead of breeding desperation
Make me a pallet on your floor
