Give her a red lipstick and a bright pair of shoes
A new bob haircut and a shot of good booze
her/(hurry?) down-sweet daddy, I'm blowing your horn
oh if you come too late
no no, your mama' will be gone

come along young man, everything's sitting right here
my husband's gone away till next Saturday night
her/(hurry?) down-sweet daddy, I'm blowing your horn
oh if you come too late
no no, your mama' will be gone

I'm round-a-go, red shoes on my feet
got my mind set right for ten years at sea
her/(hurry?) down-sweet daddy, I'm blowing your horn
if you come too late
no no, your mama' will be gone

yeah cause the red rooster says "cock-a-doodle do do"
the wishing woman says "and a doodle do"
her/(hurry?) down-sweet daddy, I'm blowing your horn
if you come too late
no no, your mama' will be gone
one more time

red rooster says "cock-a-doodle do do"
the wishing woman says "and a doodle do"
her/(hurry?) down-sweet daddy, I'm blowing your horn
if you come too late
no no, your mama' will be gone

if you come too late
your mama' will be gone
