When, whenever Paul thinks of rain, 
swallows fall in a wave and tap on his window with their beaks

And when Paul thinks of snow, 
soft winds blow round his head and his phone rings just once
late at night-like a bird calling out, 
"Won't you wake up, Paul. Don't be scared. 
Don't believe you're all alone."

"Wake, wake up, Paul," whisper clouds rolling by 
and the seeds falling from the branches of the trees...
