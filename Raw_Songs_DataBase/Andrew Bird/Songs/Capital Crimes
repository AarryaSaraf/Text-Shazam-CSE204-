We're a fine institution
We're using a test to decide
Like some kind of sick solution
Who should live and who should die

If I let go of your hand
It would be murder
Standing backwards, blindfold
At the top of the stairs
And you may wonder if I
I had assured her
As the birds were
Makin' figure eights
All around the square

If I let go of your hand
If I strayed from the laws of the land

Where's the shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the sense of shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the sense of shame?
For desert oceans keep on widening
It's been this way since the Pleistocene
Where's the shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the sense of shame?

Where's the shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the sense of shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the sense of shame?
Desert oceans keep on widening
It's been this way since the Pleistocene, yeah

Capital crimes
Nickels and dimes all across the floor
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh
No vital signs, ooh
You scored too high
Now you walk the floor
We will meet on that fatal shore

Where's the shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the sense of shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the shame?
Where's the sense of shame?
