You've been away for such a long, long time
Gone from the brickyard, gone from the mine
All these unfamiliar places used to find your measured paces
Now it's all arriving, now it's all just fine
I thought perhaps we could sit down for tea
Nein, was the cold reply of Frau ecstasy
Sitting on a mossy stump, among all the bottles drunk, breathe cold against the air
Oh I smell your ragweed hair, smoked to the bone, soaked to the bone I'm all alone, poor me
I thought perhaps we could sit down for tea
Nein, was the cold reply of Frau ecstasy
Hey, who's that old man in the overalls,
His cows lick the ice from off the stable walls
Hey, who's that old man in the overalls,
His cows licked the ice from off the stable walls
