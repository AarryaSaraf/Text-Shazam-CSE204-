I had nothing to say on Christmas Day
When you threw all your clothes on the floor
When you burned your hair and you knocked over the chair
I just tried to stay out of your way

When you fell asleep with blood on your teeth
I just got into my car and drove away
Listen to me butterfly
There's only so much wine
That you can drink in one life
But it will never be enough
To save you from the bottom of your glass

Where the state highway starts, I stopped my car
I got out and stared up at the stars
And as meteors died and shot across the sky
I just thought about your sad shining eyes

When I went back for my clothes when the sun finally rose
Oh and you were still passed out on the floor
Listen to me butterfly
There's only so much wine
That you can drink in one life
But it will never be enough
To save you from the bottom of your glass
