Wishing for contentment, hoping for relentment
venting my resentment on the happy few

Awaiting resolution, and dreams of restitution
finding retribution's just another thing to do

You've got to keep yourself busy, visit Aunt Lizzy
just see how she's been
But when you're making a late run
two judgmental matrons retort, see what I mean?

A seeming reprobation, perhaps it's my vocation
a nauseous elation comes to mind but it fades so soon
