She's got a ham in her handbag, a pig in her purse
She's got two-ply no-fly baby buggers
She's got a burlap sack, she's on a voter parade
She's gonna get some carob cigars and some lemonade
No need to put your ear to the ground
Dora Munch is coming to town

She puts eggs in her orange juice, coffee in her tea
Puts olives in her jelly, says that's the way it's gonna be
Ashes and mashes and dust and mustard
Creamed spinach sandwich and she cuts the crusts off
Don't let it show that you wanted some
Dora Munch is coming to town

Dora Munch is coming to town, you heard me the first time
Dora Munch is coming to town
