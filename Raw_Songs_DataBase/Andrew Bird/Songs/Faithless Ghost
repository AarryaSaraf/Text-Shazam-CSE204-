I seen your face before
When I was waxin' the kitchen floor
Your features carved in the faux marble linoleum
Cicadas dronin' in the midsummer's lonely hum, ba-ba-ba-ba

On this day, twenty years before
I heard the slammin' of the back screen door
I thought I was accustomed to big surprises
Until I met your faithless ghost

She takes a silver comb from her hair
Falls over her shoulders bare
Floatin' from room to room
And I was to be her groom
Oh, it ain't fair

Oh, my sweet entity
Why don't you come to visit me?
Instead, you taunt me
Listen, I want you to haunt me (Ba-ba-ba-ba)

In this, our shared history
Who gets to use the apostrophe?
Back door, kitchen floor, vapor rises
Yeah, she's a faithless ghost
Lord, she's my faithless ghost

Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

She takes a silver comb from her hair
Falls over her shoulders bare
She's floatin' from room to room
And I was to be her groom
Oh, it ain't fair

Your worldly possessions don't mean a thing to me
Only thing left within is sanctity

Back door, kitchen floor, vapor rises
I thought I was accustomed to big surprises
Back door, kitchen floor, vapor rises
Yeah, she's a faithless ghost
Mm, she's my faithless ghost
Yeah, she is my faithless

I seen your face before
