// Sisyphus //

Sisyphus peered into the mist
A stone's throw from the precipice, paused
Did he jump or did he fall as he gazed into the maw of the morning mist?
Did he raise both fists and say, "To hell with this" and just let the rock roll?

Let it roll, let it crash down low
There's a house down there but I lost it long ago
Let it roll, let it crash down low
See my house down there but I lost it long ago

Well, I let the rock roll on down to the town below
We had a house down there but I lost it long ago
Lost it long ago
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
I'm letting it roll away
It's got nothing to do with fate
And everything to do with you

I'd rather fail like a mortal than flail like a god, I'm a lightning rod
History forgets the moderates
For those who sit recalcitrant and taciturn
You know I'd rather turn and burn than scale this edifice, yeah
Where's my accomplice?
So take my hand, we'll do more than stand
Take my hand, we'll claim this land
Take my hand, and we'll let the rock roll

Let it roll, let it crash down low
There's a house down there but I lost it long ago
Let it roll, let it crash down low
See my house down there but I lost it long ago
Lost it long ago

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
I'm letting it roll away
It's got nothing to do with fate
And everything to do withâ€“

// Bloodless //

They're profiting from your worry
They're selling blanks down at the DMZ
They're banking on the sound and fury
Makes you wonder what it all's got to do with me

Bloodless for now

I'm keeping mine with the altruists
I'm putting my weight behind the dancer
I know it's hard to be an optimist
When you trust least the ones who claim to have the answers

And it's an uncivil war
It's an uncivil war
It's an uncivil war

Bloodless for now

And the poets, they explode like bombs
(Bloodless for now)
While the gentry is drinking Moet Chandon
(Bloodless for now)

Turn around and quote a well known psalm
Don't you worry 'bout the wicked
Don't you envy those who do wrong
And your innocence will be like the dawn
While the justice of your cause will shine like the noonday sun

Well, the best lack all conviction
And the worst keep sharpening their claws
They're peddling in their dark fictions
While what's left of us, well, we just hem and we haw

And it feels like 1936
In Catalonia
In Catalonia

Bloodless for now
Bloodless for now

And the poets, they explode like bombs
(Bloodless for now)
Drinking Moet Chandon
(Bloodless for now)

Turn around and quote a well known psalm
Don't you worry 'bout the wicked
Don't you envy those who do wrong
And your innocence will be like the dawn
While the justice of your cause will shine like the noonday sun

// Olympians //

You were inhabited
Speaking in tongues in the night
I wasn't having it
I could tell that something wasn't right
Why don't come to bed
Instead of stumbling into the light
Of medicine cabinets?
Shaking out pills left and right
Right

Who's giving up the most?
No one's gonna give you a medal
Who's giving up the ghost?
Oh, wouldn't you like to know

The competition rages
This nocturnal dance
The misery's contagious
We are Olympians

Oh, we're gonna turn it around
We're gonna turn it around
We're gonna turn it around
We're gonna turn it around
We're gonna turn it around, yeah
We're gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn

You start spitting out anathemas
You start spitting out anathemas
It was anathema
Spent half of my life on the exchange
Oh, it was anathema
'Bout half a mile between addled and deranged
Oh, it was anathema
La-da-da-da-da-da
It was anathema
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Who's giving up the most?
Who's giving up the most?
Who's giving up the most?
You were speaking in tongues in the night
Who's giving up the most?
I could tell that something wasn't right
Who's giving up the most?
Shaking out pills left and right
Who's giving up the most?
Stumbling into the light
Light

The competition rages
This nocturnal dance
Misery's contagious
We are Olympians
Ho, we're gonna turn it around
We're gonna turn it around
We're gonna turn it around
We're gonna turn it around
We're gonna turn it around, yeah
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around
Gonna turn it around

// Cracking Codes //

You just have to look into my eyes
You don't need a secret code
No need to play at being spies
And though I may speak to you in tongues
We don't need Rosetta Stone
To know how this song is sung
And that what I say is true
Yeah, it's true
True, oh, yeah

And I know that what I say just sounds absurd
But you can read between the lines
And you can savor every word
There'll be times when you are stammering through tears
So long they're not from crocodiles
It will be music to my ears
To your ears, to my ears
Because what you say is true
Yeah, it's true

'Cause what I say is

// Fallorun //

We could have been together
But you couldn't stand the weather here
You know I was your rain and thunder
Upon your hills and valleys
We could have been together
But you couldn't stand the weather here

You know that light is passing through it
It's 'cause there's nothing really here
You know he's just a mere conduit
For all of your fears
You think you're making choices
But there's no one really here
Just tone-deaf angry voices
That are breathing in your ear

[Chorus 1]
Fallorun, fallorun
Fallorun, fallorun
It's taking us back to a one-horse town
Building us up just to tear us down
So you can fall or run

You know we could have been together
But you traded hell for leather
A closer walk with thee
And we locked our horns forever
We could've been together
But you couldn't stand the weather here

He's nothing without you
He's nothing without you

You think it's just an aberration
That it could not happen here
Such an abomination
Could be the man of the year
You think you're making choices
But there's nothing really here
Just tone-deaf angry voices
That are breathing in your ear

[Chorus 2]
Fallorun, fallorun
Fallorun, fallorun
They say Rome wasn't built in a day
But it all came down in the month of May
Oh, fall or run

You know we could have been together
But you couldn't stand the weather here
You know I was your rain and thunder
Upon your hills and valleys, dear
We could have been together
But you couldn't stand the weather here

You think you're making choices
But there's nothing really here
Just tone-deaf angry voices
That are breathing in your ear

Fallorun, fallorun
Fallorun, fallorun
Fallorun, fallorun
Fallorun

He's taking us back to a one-horse town
Building us up just to tear us down
Well, we sure hope you can stick around
And you don't fallorun
Oh

// Archipelago //

What if one day we just refused to play
With no one to hate, they'd be out of a job
You've gone off script, you just can't walk away
Leave us naked, fleeced and racked with sobs

Whoa
We're locked in a death grip and it's taking its toll
When our enemies are what make us whole
Listen to me
No more excuses, no more apathy
This ain't no archipelago, no remote atoll

All my enemies, they just fall in love with me
Keeping us distracted while the till gets robbed
All our cries were cried
Now there are no sides
Try selling that one to an angry mob

Whoa
J. Edgar Hoover wore a white mink stole
His enemies are what made him whole
Oh, what made him whole
(His enemies are what made him whole)
Whoa
A three-headed monster swallows Tokyo
Her enemies are what make her whole
(Her enemies are what make her whole)
Whoa
(Our enemies are what make us whole)
We're locked in a death grip and it's taking its toll
When our enemies are what make us whole
(Our enemies are what make us whole)
Whoa
(Our enemies are what make us whole)
No more excuses, no more apathy
This ain't no archipelago, no remote atoll
(Our enemies are what make us whole)
(Our enemies are what make us whole)

// Proxy War //

He don't have to get over her
She don't to have get over him
With all their words preserved for evermore
You don't have to get over her
She don't have to get over you
It's true these two have never met before

At least not in real life
Where your words cut like a knife
Conjuring blood
Biblical floods
Looks that stop time

You don't have to remember
We forget what memories are for
Now we store them in the atmosphere
If you don't want to get too close
You don't have to get too close
It's what we're calling peer to peer
You don't want to get over
You don't have to get over
We store them in the atmosphere
If you don't want to get over her
She don't have to get over you
It's true these two have never met before

At least not in real life
Where your words cut like a knife
Conjuring blood
Biblical floods
Looks that stop time

If you don't want to get over her
You don't have to get over her
If you don't want to get too close
You don't have to get too close
If you want to remember
If you don't want to get over her
If you don't want to get over her
If you don't want to get over her

// Manifest //

I'm coming to the edge of the widest canyon
My companion's dear
I'm starting to question my manifest destiny
My claim to this frontier

I'm coming to the brink of a great disaster
End just has to be near
The earth spins faster, whistles right past you
Whispers death in your ear
Don't pretend you can't hear
Don't pretend you can't

I can hear your tendrils still digging
For everything that's walked this earth once living
Then to be exhumed and burned to vapor
Can you save her?
Now she's in the air
Radical and free
Neither here nor there
She's obliged to no one
She's obliged to no one
Yeah, yeah

I'm coming to the edge of a rising ocean
Such commotion and fear
Keeping all our eyes on what's on the horizon
And all that we hold dear

I'm coming to the brink of a great disaster
End just has to be near
The earth spins faster, whistles right past you
Whispers death in your ear
Don't pretend you can't hear
Don't pretend you can't

I can hear your tendrils still digging
For everything that's walked this earth once living
Then to be exhumed and burned to vapor
Can you save her?
She's in the air
Radical and free
Not a goddamn care
She's obliged to no one
She's obliged to no one
Oh, no

Don't pretend you can't hear
Don't pretend you can't hear

// Don The Struggle //

Come on everybody, let's settle down
We're all just stumbling down
In an unnamed struggling town
We're all just stumbling down
In an unnamed struggling town

I saw you stumble through the theater
Spilling drinks on everyone
And it's the young ones that I fear for
Forgive us, we know not what we've done

Come on everybody, let's settle down
We're all just stumbling down
In an unnamed struggling town
We're all just stumbling down
In an unnamed struggling town

Clinging to the thread of the notion 
That your fight is a righteous one
The more you have to try to convince yourself
The more you're gonna hear a dissonant sound
But dissonance is energy 
While the consonance remind you of your poverty
Do you follow me?

Oh, come on everybody, let's settle down
We're all just stumbling down
In an unnamed struggling town
We're all just stumbling down
In an unnamed struggling town

I saw you limping through the exit row
Boasting of the wars you've won
You know they say that what you reap you sow
You're welcome, enjoy the mess but now I'm done
Yeah, you can thank me later but now my race is run

// Bellevue Bridge Club //

And I will hold you hostage
Make you part of my conspiracy
You will be witness to carnage
You know there's no you without me

I'm gonna shake you
Till it wakes you, yeah
From your waking dream
Show you affecting scenes
Of life beyond your front door
I will exploit you
Then conscript you
For my narrative schemes
Show you distressing scenes
I'm gonna drag you from your bed onto the floor
By any means necessary
By any means necessary
By any means necessary

I'm gonna dig up what you buried, yeah
By any means necessary

There you go again
Finding brilliant ways to make things harder
Are we smarter alone or in this endless Stockholm syndrome?
Here's what is known
We're gonna break this two-way mirror

I'm gonna shake you, break you
By any means necessary
By any means necessary
By any means necessary
By any means necessary (Til some)
By any means necessary (Some day)
By any means necessary (Whoa, some sweet day)

We will be playing bridge on the psych ward
With Arthur, Jane and Lou
We will be playing bridge on the psych ward
With Barbara, Gene and Sue
Whoa, and if you ever start to get bored
You know there's no one to blame but you

And I will hold you hostage
Make you part of my conspiracy
You will be witness to carnage
You know there's no you without me
