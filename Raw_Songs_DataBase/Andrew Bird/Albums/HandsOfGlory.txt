// Three White Horses //

There'll be three white horses, all in a line
There'll be three white horses in a line

Three white horses, when you go that way
You will need somebody when you come to die

Don't dismiss it like it's easy
Tell me what's so easy
'Bout coming to say goodbye

You're gonna miss her in the evening
You know I won't be needing
Somebody when you come to die

There'll be three white horses in a line
There'll be three white horses in a line
There'll be three white horses when you go that way
You will need somebody when you come to die

It's not desperation that we're breeding
It's just a need we're feeding
Before we say goodbye

You're gonna miss me in the evenings
You know I won't be needing
Somebody when you come to die
Yeah, I won't be needing
Somebody when you come to die

// When That Helicopter Comes //

It's gonna rain champagne
And the hills are gonna dance
There'll be power in the blood
When the helicopters come

Sky will swim in lightning fire
And the trees will shake and scream
There'll be power in the blood
When the helicopters come

When the helicopters come
There'll be power in the blood
When the helicopters come

Rocks are gonna roll uphill
And the sun will dive in the sea
There'll be power in the blood
When the helicopters come

The dead are gonna wake and sing
And roll their bones in the grass
There'll be power in the blood
When the helicopters come

When the helicopters come
There'll be power in the blood
When the helicopters come
