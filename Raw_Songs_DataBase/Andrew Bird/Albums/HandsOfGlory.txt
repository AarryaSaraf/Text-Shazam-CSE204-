// Three White Horses //

There'll be three white horses, all in a line
There'll be three white horses in a line

Three white horses, when you go that way
You will need somebody when you come to die

Don't dismiss it like it's easy
Tell me what's so easy
'Bout coming to say goodbye

You're gonna miss her in the evening
You know I won't be needing
Somebody when you come to die

There'll be three white horses in a line
There'll be three white horses in a line
There'll be three white horses when you go that way
You will need somebody when you come to die

It's not desperation that we're breeding
It's just a need we're feeding
Before we say goodbye

You're gonna miss me in the evenings
You know I won't be needing
Somebody when you come to die
Yeah, I won't be needing
Somebody when you come to die

// When That Helicopter Comes //

It's gonna rain champagne
And the hills are gonna dance
There'll be power in the blood
When the helicopters come

Sky will swim in lightning fire
And the trees will shake and scream
There'll be power in the blood
When the helicopters come

When the helicopters come
There'll be power in the blood
When the helicopters come

Rocks are gonna roll uphill
And the sun will dive in the sea
There'll be power in the blood
When the helicopters come

The dead are gonna wake and sing
And roll their bones in the grass
There'll be power in the blood
When the helicopters come

When the helicopters come
There'll be power in the blood
When the helicopters come

// Spirograph //

Echoes down water wells
Picked up in sacred spirograph
Weekend and winter's unendable bendable baby

They buried him next to his first wife
His widow watched from under a visor
Daughter tried to keep her out of the sun that was blazing
Oh, oh

Then the sun went down
And she went to sleep
She lays her burden down
She don't need to sleep

When they were done they went back home
To a house he built with opposable thumbs
When they were so much younger
Oh, oh

Five years later she died in her house
All the breath that blows all the dust around
It just keeps on sifting
Oh, oh

Then the sun went down
And she went to sleep
She lays her burden down
She don't need to sleep, oh no

Echoes down water wells
Picked up in sacred spirograph
Weekend and winter's unendable bendable baby

// Railroad Bill //

Railroad Bill, Railroad Bill
Never worked and he never will
I'm gonna ride Railroad Bill

Well, Railroad Bill was a mighty mean man
Shot the light out of the brakeman's hand
I'm gonna ride that bad Railroad Bill

Well Miss McMillan, she whooped and she squawked
That's my husband for I heard him fall
I'm gonna ride that bad Railroad Bill

Well I went down on Number One
Railroad Bill had just begun
I'm gonna ride Railroad Bill

Well I came back on Number Two
Railroad Bill had just got through
I'm gonna ride Railroad Bill

Well I went down on Number Four
Someone let fly with a forty-four
I'm gonna ride Railroad Bill

Got a thirty-eight special in a forty-five frame
I ain't gonna miss 'cause I've got dead aim
I'm gonna ride that bad Railroad Bill

Well Railroad Bill, rolling down a hill
Lighting cigars with a ten-dollar bill
I'm gonna ride that bad Railroad Bill

Well, Railroad Bill says, Before I die
I'm gonna build a railroad for the bums to ride
I'm gonna ride that bad Railroad Bill

// Something Biblical //

Take your apples from the earth
And your fingerlings from the air
If you cried when you were born
'Cause it ain't fair
You got nothing, nothing to wear

And there's a drink that we're all needing
A need to weep but we have tried
And though the clouds we keep on seeding
Still the county remains dry, the county remains dry
The county remains dry

I see your coat, that it needs sewing
And these seeds will sow the corn silk bride
But in your absence nothing's growing
And still the county remains dry, the county remains dry
The county remains dry

Well still we keep on dreaming
Of that fifty-year flood
Of oceans of plasma
And rivers of blood

Take your apples from the earth
And your fingerlings from the air
If you cried when you were born
'Cause it ain't fair
You got nothing, nothing to wear

// If I Needed You //

If I needed you would you come to me
Would you come to me, for ease my pain?
If you needed me
I would come to you
I'd swim the seas for to ease your pain

In the night forlorn when the morning's born
And the morning shines with the lights of love
You will miss sunrise if you close your eyes
And that would break my heart in two

The lady's with me now since I showed her how
To lay her lily hand in mine
Loop and Lil agree she's a sight to see
And a treasure for the poor to find

If I needed you would you come to me
Would you come to me, for ease my pain?

// Orpheo //

There are places we must go to
To bring these hollow words on back from
You must cross the muddy river
Where love turns to, love turns to fear

They say you don't look
There's only one way
On back from, on back from here
They say you don't look
'Cause it'll disappear

And our eyes they keep on straining
As if to see what lies behind 'em
Through the shells of empty buildings
And great columns of glass

They say you don't look
They say you don't look
'Cause it'll drive you mad
And if it drives you mad
Drives you mad
It'll probably pass

And if it drives you mad
And if it drives you mad
It'll probably pass

And if it drives you mad
If it drives you mad
It'll probably pass
