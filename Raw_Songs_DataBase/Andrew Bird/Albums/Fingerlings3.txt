// A Nervous Tic Motion Of The Head To The Left //

Overprescribed
Under the mister
We had survived to
Turn on the History Channel
And ask our esteemed panel
Why are we alive?
And here's how they replied
You're what happens when two substances collide
And by all accounts you really should have died

Stretched out on a tarmac
Six miles south of North Platte
He can't stand to look back
At sixteen tons of HAZMAT
It's what goes undelivered
Undelivered
Boom boom boom boom boom

It's a nervous tic motion of the head to the left
It's a nervous tic motion of the head to the left
Of the what, of the head to the left
So exercise yourselves to your bereft
'Cause it's a nervous tic motion of the head to the left of the, of the, to the

Splayed out on a bath mat
Six miles north of South Platte
He just wants his life back
What's in that paper knapsack
It's what goes undelivered
Undelivered

It's a nervous tic motion of the head to the left
A nervous tic motion of the head
Head to the left
It's a nervous tic motion of the, of the, to the
Left

It's a nervous tic motion of the head to the, of the, of the head of the head to the

Over imbibed
Under the mister
Barely alive we cover the blisters in flannel
Though the words we speak are banal
Now one of them's a lie
Now one of them's a lie
You're what happens when two substances collide
And by all accounts you really should have died

// Measuring Cups //

Get out your measuring cups and we'll play a new game
Come to the front of the class and we'll measure your brain
We'll give you a complex and we'll give it a name

Get out your measuring cups and we'll play a new game
Can't have the cream when the crop and the cream are the same
Liquid or gas no more than the glass will contain

When you talk about the hand of glory
A tale that's rather grim and gory
Is it just another children's story that's been de-clawed?
When the tales of brothers Grimm and Gorey have been outlawed

I think they're gonna make you start over
You don't want to start over
Put your backpack on your shoulder
Be the good little soldier
Take your places now
'Cause we're all predisposed

Measuring cups, play a new game
Front of the class, measure your brain
Give you a complex and we'll give it a name

When you talk about the hand of glory
A tale that's rather grim and gory
Is it just another children's story that's been de-clawed?
When the tales of brothers Grimm and Gorey have been outlawed

Put your backpack on your shoulder
Be the good little soldier
It's no different when you're older
You're predisposed
That's all for questions now
The case is closed!

// The Happy Birthday Song //

When I wake up
In the morning
I pour the coffee
Read the paper
Then I slowly
And so softly
Do the dishes
Feed the fishes
Sing me Happy Birthday
Sing it like it's going to be your last day
Like it's halleujah
Don't just let it pass on through ya
It's a giant among cliches
And that's why I want you to sing it anyway
Sing me Happy Birthday
Cause hell what's it all about
Anyway
Sing me Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday
Like it's gonna be your last day
Here on earth

// Grinnin' //

Now don't you mind people grinnin' in your face.
Now don't you mind people grinnin' in your face.
Just bear this in mind
A true friend is hard to find.
Don't you mind people grinnin' in your face.

You know your mother's gonna talk about you.
Your sisters and your brothers too
No matter how you try to live
You know they'll talk about you still.

So bear this in mind
A true friend is hard to find.
Don't you mind people grinnin' in your face.

// Dear Dirty //

Dear Dirty, I'm a man strong and [?]
And I live in a cave, using my blood to draw,blood to draw
And I live in a cave, [?]
Something I come up to, something I come up to
Something I come up to, using my blood to draw
the blood to draw animal,like the bull
Dear Dirty,
Then I go to find more things,
Go for walks to find things I, 
I can use to make the tools to kill
all these animals, or all these things
Dear Dirty

// Tin Foil //

Late New Years Eve paper hat on your head
It was hard to believe that you'd ever be dead
And that dream that you're falling you've had since you're five
Is a bird on your shoulder that whispers goodbye

What is moving will be still
What has gathered will disperse
What has been built up will collapse
All of your dreams are fulfilled

Evil Knievel shot up from dead grass
And I loved him better each time that he crashed
And Liza Minnelli spent a month in her bed
She was certain that Skylab would fall on her head

What is moving will be still
What has gathered will disperse
What's been built up will collapse
All of your dreams are fulfilled

Last night I dreamed that I dug my own grave
And I climbed down inside there to patiently wait
And down in the ground while I breathed the cold air
The blackbirds came down there to nest in my hair

What's moving will be still
What has gathered will disperse
What has been built up will collapse
All of your dreams
All of your dreams are fulfilled
Are fulfilled
Are fulfilled
Are fulfilled
Are
