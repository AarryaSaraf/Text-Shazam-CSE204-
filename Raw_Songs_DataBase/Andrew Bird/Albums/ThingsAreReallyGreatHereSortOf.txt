// Don't Be Scared //

When, whenever Paul thinks of rain, 
swallows fall in a wave and tap on his window with their beaks

And when Paul thinks of snow, 
soft winds blow round his head and his phone rings just once
late at night-like a bird calling out, 
"Won't you wake up, Paul. Don't be scared. 
Don't believe you're all alone."

"Wake, wake up, Paul," whisper clouds rolling by 
and the seeds falling from the branches of the trees...

// Cathedral In The Dell //

The cathedral in Cologne looks like a spaceship
Like the hand of God falling from the sky
A thousand stone carved saints hang like icicles
But icicles don't take a thousand years to die

And all of us who worked on this cathedral
Or even spent a moment passing by
All of us are swept away like breadcrumbs
What comfort does it bring, soaring towers left behind
Towers left behind

Well there's a fiberglass castle in Wisconsin
Where kids race go-karts around a moat
Once we went up there in December
When all the water slides and fudge shops were closed

Looking to find love under the ice machine
But all we did was drink in empty bars
Stumbling drunk, we crawled back to our hotel room
I fell against you, felt your beating heart
I felt your beating heart

Well the snow was slowly falling on the ice machine
And the moon shone hazy through the pines
Lawn chairs are thrown into an empty pool
A dog chained to a tree, barking at the sky
Towers left behind

// Tin Foiled //

What is moving will be still
What has gathered will disperse
What's been built up will collapse
All of your dreams are fulfilled

Late New Years Eve paper hat on your head
It was hard to believe that you'd ever be dead
And that dream that you're falling you've had since you're five
Is a bird on your shoulder that whispers goodbye, goodbye

What is moving will be still
What has gathered will disperse
What has been built up will collapse
All of your dreams are fulfilled

And Liza Minnelli spent a month in her bed
She was certain that Skylab would fall on her head
Evil Knievel shot up from dead grass
And I loved him better each time that he crashed, that he crashed

What is moving will be still
What has gathered will disperse
What's been built up will collapse
All of your dreams are fulfilled

Last night I dreamed that I dug my own grave
And I climbed down inside there to patiently wait
And down in the ground while I breathed the cold air
The blackbirds came down there to nest in my hair

What's moving will be still
What has gathered will disperse
What has been built up will collapse
All of your dreams
All of your dreams are fulfilled
Are fulfilled
Are fulfilled
Are fulfilled
Are

// Giant Of Illinois //

The Giant of Illinois
Died of a blister on his toe

After walking all day
Through the first winters' snow

Throwing bits of stale bread
to the last speckled doves

He never even felt,
his shoes fill with blood

Delirious with pain,
his bedroom walls began to glow

And he felt himself floating
up through falling snow

And the sky was a woman's arms
And the sky was a woman's arms

A boy with a clubbed foot
sat next to him at school

Once upon a summer's day
they went walking through the woods

They spotted a sleeping swan
On the banks of a muddy stream

They stoned it with rocks
till it collapsed in the reeds

They laid out on the grass
full of chocolate and lemonade

And underneath it all
the Giant was afraid

And the sky was a woman's arms
Oh, the sky was a woman's arms

And the sky was a woman's arms.

// So Much Wine, Merry Christmas //

I had nothing to say on Christmas day
When you threw all your clothes in the snow
When you burnt your hair, and you knocked over chairs
I just tried to stay out of your way
But when you fell asleep
With blood on your teeth, I just got in my car and drove away

Listen to me, butterfly
There's only so much wine
That you can drink one life,
but it will never be enough,
To save you from the bottom of your glass

Where the state highway starts, I stop my car
I get out, to stare up at the stars
And as meteors die
And shout across the sky
I just stop about your setting shining eyes
And I went back for my clothes, when the sun finally rose
Oh,You were still passed out on the floor

Listen to me, butterfly
There's only so much wine
That you can drink one life,
but it will never be enough,
To save you from the bottom of your glass

// My Sister's Tiny Hands //

We came in this world together
Legs wrapped around each other
My cheek against my sister's
We were born like tangled vine

We lived along the river
Where the black clouds never lingered
The sunlight spread like honey
Through my sister's tiny hands

But while picking sour apples
In the wild waving grasses
Sister stumbled in the briar
And was bitten by a snake

Every creature casts a shadow
Under the sun's golden fingers
And as the sun sinks past the waving grass
Some shadows are dragged along

Alone, I took to drinking
Bottles of cheap whiskey
And staggering through the back woods
Killing snakes with a sharpened stick

But still I heard her laughing
In those wild waving grasses
Still her tiny hands went splashing
At the river's sparkling shore

So I took my rusty gas can
And an old iron shovel
I set the woods to blaze
And choked the river up with stones

Every creature casts a shadow
Under the sun's golden fingers
And as the sun sinks past the waving grass
Some shadows are dragged along

// The Sad Milkman //

Above the dark highways on a black tar roof
Stood the Sad Milkman in love with the moon
She filled up his window with soft milky light
'Til he crawled up the chimney and into the night

But the moon she rises and the moon she falls
And her slow white eye sees nothing at all

Down on the sidewalks a crowd gathered 'round
Flinging up bricks and bottles to knock the boy down
He stood up above them with his hands in the air
Calling up to the moonbeams, "Come let down your hair!"

But the moon she rises and the moon she falls
And her slow white eye sees nothing at all

He wanted to feel like a bucket of milk
Or sweet summer wind on rolling green hills
He wanted to fly up from the roof
Sailing up from the night wind to the arms of the moon

But the moon she rises and the moon she falls
And her slow white eye sees nothing at all
But the moon she rises and the moon she falls
And her slow white eye sees nothing at all

// Frogs Singing //

Have you ever seen a fish don't be enough from a quiet stream
Shine a moment in the light then fall away again?
Have you seen it, brother? Won't you come outside and see?
Have you ever seen the rain turn the earth to mud
And watched the mud turn gold in the rising sun?

Have you seen it, brother? Won't you come outside and see?
Won't you come with me tonight down to the lowland fields
To hear the frogs singing, the air so hot and still?
Won't you come with me, sister? Won't you come with me tonight?

Down in the flooded fields the earth is wet and dark
Down in the flooded fields beneath the falling stars
Won't you down in the dirt, brother, be a mirror to the night
Won't you down in the dirt, sister, I'll your mirror to the night
Won't you down in the dirt, brother, be a mirror to the night
Won't you down in the dirt, sister, I'll your mirror to the night

// Drunk By Noon //

There once was a poodle who thought he was a cowboy, 
He lived in a cage the size of his thumb
And, though his white horse was a box of toothpicks, 
he galloped around until hit by a car

Sometimes I flap my arms like a hummingbird 
just to remind myself I'll never fly
Sometimes I burn my arms with cigarettes 
just to pretend I won't scream when I die

If my life was as long as the moon's, 
I'd still be jealous of the sun
If my life lasted only one day, 
I'd still be drunk by noon,
Yes, I'd still be drunk by noon.

Sometimes I hope to come down with cancer
At least then I'll get to watch TV all day
And on my deathbed I'll get all the answers 
even if all my questions are taken away.

If my life was as long as the moon's, 
I'd still be jealous of the sun
If my life lasted only one day, 
I'd still be drunk by noon,
I'd still be drunk by noon.

// Far From Any Road (Be My Hand) //

From the dusty mesa
Her looming shadow grows
Hidden in the poison creosote
In the hushing dusk
Under a swollen silver moon
I came walking with the wind
To watch the cactus bloom

She twines her spines up slowly
Towards the boiling sun
And when I touched her skin
My fingers ran with blood
Then rise with me forever
Across the silent sands
And the stars will be your eyes
And the wind will be my hand, will be my hand

A strange hunger haunted me
The looming shadows danced
I fell down to the thorny brush
And felt a trembling hand
And when the last light warms the rocks
And the rattlesnakes unfold
Cats will come to drag away your bones

She twines her spines up slowly
Towards the boiling sun
And when I touched her skin
My fingers ran with blood
Oh, rise with me forever
Across the silent sands
And the stars will be your eyes
And the wind will be my hand, will be my hand
