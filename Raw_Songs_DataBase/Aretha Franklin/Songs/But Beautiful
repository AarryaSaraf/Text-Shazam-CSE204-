Love is funny or it's sad
It's quiet or it's mad
It's a good thing or it's bad
So beautiful

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall
And I'm thinking that I wouldn't mind at all

Love is tearful or it's gay
It's a problem or it's play
It's a heartache anyway
But it's still so beautiful

And I'm thinking, ooh, ooh, if you were mine
Why I'd never let you go
And this would be so beautiful, I know
This would be beautiful, I know
