Take it, take it just like you give it, oh oh oh oh, oh
Take it like you give it

Baby, can I say that I'm sorry
For the things I said last night
But I'm human too, just like you
When I don't always do things right
And sometimes you aren't so very nice
But I smile and still pay the price
Now, if you love me let me see your limit

And just take it like you give it, yeah (take it, take it just like you give it)
Take it like you give it, yeah (take it, take it just like you give it)
Baby, there's a whole lot of people (oh oh oh oh, oh)
Who just can't see the forest for the trees (oh oh oh oh, oh)
And you just don't know, oh, how sad I am (oh oh oh oh, oh)
The thing you might be one of these, hey yeah

I wanna make up for this reason (oh oh oh oh, oh)
Whether if you're wrong or right (oh oh oh oh, oh)
I'm in misery, and I know you're must be (oh oh oh oh, oh)
I pull the switch I've ever fired
So don't make it hard for me to comeback
And if you love me let me see your limit

And just take it like you give it, yeah (take it, take it just like you give it) (oh oh oh oh, oh)
Take it like you give it, yeah (take it like you give it)
Take it like you give it, yeah (take it, take it just like you give it) (oh oh oh oh, oh)
Take it like you give it, yeah (take it like you give it)
