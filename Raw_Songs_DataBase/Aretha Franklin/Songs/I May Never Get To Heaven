I walked with you and talked with you
And held your lovin' hand
We loved a while, I lived a while
And thought fate had a plan

Oh, but someone stole my angel
And I lost what I loved most
I may never ever get to heaven
But I once came mighty close

Never play a golden harp or spread celestial wings
Or walk up a golden staircase
While the distant chorus sings

I once held your sweet love
And I felt your tender touch
I may never ever get to heaven
But I didn't miss it much

I may never ever ever get to heaven
But I did, I really didn't miss it much
(Miss it much)
