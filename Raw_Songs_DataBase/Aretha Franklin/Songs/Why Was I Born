Why was I born, why am I livin'?
What do I get, what am I givin'?
Why do I want a thing I daren't hope for?
What can I hope for? I wish I knew

Why do I try to draw you near me?
Why do I do I cry? You never hear me
I'm a poor fool, but what can I do?
Why was I born to love you?

Why do I try to draw you near me?
Why do I do I cry? You never hear me

I'm a poor fool, but what can I do?
Why was I born to love you?

Some other versions may include an
Spending these lonesome evenings with nothing to do
But to live in dreams that I make up all by myself
Dreaming that you're beside me, I picture the prettiest stories
Only to wake up all by myself What is the good of me by myself?
