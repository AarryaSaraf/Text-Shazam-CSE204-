I, I wish I didn't love you so
My love for you should have ended long ago
Ooh and I, I wish I didn't need your kiss
Why should your kiss torture me as long as this?

I should be smiling by now with some new tender friend
Smiling by now with my heart on the mend

But when I try, something in my heart says no
You're still there and I wish I didn't love you so
Ooh I, I wish I didn't love you so
