In my solitude
You haunt me
With memories
Of days gone by
In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair
No one could be so sad
I sit and I stare
There's gloom everywhere
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I pray
Dear Lord above
Please send back my love

I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair
No one, no one could be so sad
I sit and I stare
Oh, there's gloom everywhere
I know that I'll soon, I'll soon go mad

Oh, in my solitude
I pray
Oh, dear Lord, dear Lord above
Send back my love
