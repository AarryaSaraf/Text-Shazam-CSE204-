If they had ever
Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever told me
If they had ever, ever told me how sweet a kiss could be
I would have said impossible, impossible for me
And if they said that I'd find you beyond the rainbow's end
I would have said it's impossible, impossible, my friend

To dream about what might have been is strange enough for me
But now it seems that I'm living in a dream too beautiful to be

And if they'd said that I'd find you beside a stormy sea
I would have said it's impossible for now I, I see
That nothing is impossible if you are here with me
