I wanna be around to pick up the pieces
When somebody breaks your heart
Somebody twice as smart as I

A somebody who will swear to be true
Like you used to do with me
Oh, but who'll leave you to learn
That misery loves company, oh, wait and see

And I do mean, I wanna be around to see how she does it
When she breaks your heart to bits
Now let's see how the puzzle fits so fine

And that's when I'll discover that revenge is so sweet
As I sit there applaudin' from a front-row seat
When somebody breaks your heart like you broke mine
Oh, yeah, like you, oh, like you broke mine, yeah
