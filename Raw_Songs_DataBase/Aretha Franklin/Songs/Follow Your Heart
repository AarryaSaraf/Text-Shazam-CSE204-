Follow your heart where it leads you (where it leads you)
Give your love to the one
The one who needs you (the one who needs you)
Darling, I'll understand and I'll step aside
I won't stand in your way if you're not satisfied (satisfied)
Follow, follow your heart

You know what's best for you (you know what's best for you)
And I love you much, too much
To try and stop you (too much to stop you)
But if you ever, ever, ever find that you are unhappy, yeah
Follow your heart back to me, yeah
Follow your heart back to me, yeah (follow your heart)
