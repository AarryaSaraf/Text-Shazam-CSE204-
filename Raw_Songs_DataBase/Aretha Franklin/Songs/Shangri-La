Shangri-La, Shangri-La

Your kisses take me to Shangri-La
Each kiss is magic
That makes my little world a Shangri-La

A land of bluebirds, fountains
And nothing to do
But cling to a lover just like you

And when you hold me, how warm you are
Be mine, my darling
And spend your life with me in Shangri-La
For anywhere you are is Shangri-La
(Shangri-La, Shangri-La)
