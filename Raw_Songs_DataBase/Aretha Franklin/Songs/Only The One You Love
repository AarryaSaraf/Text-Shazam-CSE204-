Only the one you love can hurt you (can hurt you)
Only the one you trust in most of all (most of all)
Nobody else you know (you know)
Could ever hurt you so (you so)
Or tear you all apart

Only the one you love can fool you (can fool you)
Only the one who's closest to your heart (to your heart)
And that's cause you can't believe
He ever would deceive
Or leave you or let you fall or let you die (uh uh, uh uh)

Strangers can't harm you
It's been proved many times before
Only the one you love can hurt you
But each hurt makes you love him more and more (more and more, more and more)
But each hurt, it makes you love him more and more (more and more, more and more)
Every little hurt makes you love him...
