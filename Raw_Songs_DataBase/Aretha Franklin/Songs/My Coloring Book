In case you fancy coloring books, and lots of people do
I've a new one for you
A most unusual coloring book, the kind you'd never see
Crayons ready, very well, begin to color me

These are the eyes that watched him as he walked away
Color them gray
This is the heart that thought he would always be true
Color it blue
These are the arms that held him, and touched him, then lost him somehow
Color them empty now
These are the beads I wore until she came between
If you like, color them green

This is the room I sleep in and walk in and weep in and hide in
That nobody ever sees, color it lonely, please
This is the man, the one, the one I depended upon
You must color him gone
He's gone, color him gone
