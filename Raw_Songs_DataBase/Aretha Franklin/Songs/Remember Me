Remember me
I'm the girl you said hello to
And gave a special glow to
One sweet yesterday

Remember me
And the times we had together
We swore they'd last forever
Darling come what may

How could two people so much in love drift so far apart?
Oh my darling, could it be possible I was never, never in your heart?

Remember me
I'm the girl you said you'd always love
You swore by stars above
Oh, don't you recall ever having love me, love me at all?
