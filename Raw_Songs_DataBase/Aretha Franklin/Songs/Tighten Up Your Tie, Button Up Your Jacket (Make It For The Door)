Don't get too comfortable, my boy
I'm expecting company
Don't you have somewhere else to go?
Or do you just like to visit me?
You can't come around any time you please (uh, uh)
Just like you did before (uh, uh)

So tighten up your tie (tighten up)
Button up that jacket (button up)
And make it for the door (make it for the door)

Don't get too close to me, my boy
I'm not playing around with you
Can't you leave well enough alone?
Why can't you just realize we're through?
I couldn't start again, oh no, sir-ee (uh, uh)
I couldn't take it any more (uh, uh)

So tighten up your tie (tighten up)
Button up that jacket (button up)
And make it for the door (make it for the door)

Oh, the bell might ring any minute
And he just wouldn't understand
You had romance but you blew your chance
Trying to play a double hand
You know that I'm weak for you, my boy (auh bop, auh bop)
Ah, did you just come around to see (auh bop, auh bop)
If your sweet and tender charms (auh bop, auh bop)
Would still work out on me? (auh bop, auh bop)

Well, even if you did (if you did)
You can still grab your hat (your hat)
'Cause now I know the score (uh, uh, uh)
Tighten up your tie (tighten up)
Button up your jacket (button up)
And make it for the door (make it for the door)

Let it hit you in the back, make it for the door (tighten up your tie, uh, ah ah ah)
You oughta choke yourself with that jacket (button up your jacket, uh, ah ah ah)
Oh, then button up that shark skin (make it for the door, uh, ah ah ah)
Baby, and make it for the door (tighten up your tie)
