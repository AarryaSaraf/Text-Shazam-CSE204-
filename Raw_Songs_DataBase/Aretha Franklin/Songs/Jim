Jim doesn't ever bring me pretty flowers
Jim never tries to cheer my lonely hours
I don't know why I'm so crazy for Jim

Jim never tells me I'm his heart's desire
I never seem to set his love afire
Gone are the years that I've wasted on him
Sometimes when I get to feeling low
And I say "Let's call it quits"
Then I hang on and let him go
Breaking my heart into bits

Someday, someday I know Jim will up and leave me
But if he does, you can believe me
I'll go on carrying the torch for Jim (Jim)
