Sitting here thinking
I'm trying to write a song
If I don't get me a hit soon
I won't be here long

I got a lyric writer
Got me a piano man
And we're making these words
Just as tight as we can

Now we want these words
Tender and bold
They don't have to be strong
Just give us a whole lot of soul

Now, hey little boy
Come over here with me
And you show me how
To do that dance called the plip

Can you show me how to wobble?
Can we do it together?
Come on and let's bend over
Come on and let's shake a tail feather

We want these words
Tender and bold
They don't have to be strong
Just give me a whole lot of soul

Soul (soul), soul (soul)
Soul (soul), soul (soul)
A little soul (soul), soul (soul)
A little soul (soul), soul (soul)

Now, how am I doing? (Doing alright now)
Am I doing alright? (Doing alright now)
I got this song (doing alright now)
And I got this boy (doing alright now)

I got a piano man (ah, ah, ah)
And a great big band (ah, ah, ah)
Now, I wanna hear the trumpets (ah, ah, ah)
Blowing out loud

Let me see the action
Coming in from the crowd
And take me, rock by my hand (doing alright now)

A little bit of soul, and
A little soul (soul), soul (soul)
A little soul (soul), soul (soul)
A little soul (soul), soul (soul)
A little soul (soul), soul (soul)

Tell me how am I doing?
(Doing alright now)
Am I doing alright?
(You're doing alright now)
Tell me how am I doing?
(You're doing alright now)
Am I doing alright?
