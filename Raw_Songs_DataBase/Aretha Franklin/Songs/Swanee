Swanee
How I love ya, how I love ya
My dear old Swanee
I'd give the world to be
Among my folks in
D-I-X-I-Even though my (Swanee)
People are
Waitin' for me, prayin' for me
Down by the Swanee
The folks up north (north)
Will see me no more
When I get to that Swanee shore

Oh, Swanee
How I love ya, how I love ya
My dear old Swanee
I'd give the world if I could only be
Among my folks in
D-I-X-I-Even though my (Swanee)
People are
Waitin' for me, prayin' for me
Down by the Swanee
The folks up north (north)
Will never (will)
Just see me no more
When I get to that Swanee (Swanee)
Well, let me get through that Swanee (Swanee)
When I cross that Swanee shore
