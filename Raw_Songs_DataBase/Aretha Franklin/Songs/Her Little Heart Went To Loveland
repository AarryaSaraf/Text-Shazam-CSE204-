Her little heart went to Loveland
His little heart stayed at home
Her little heart gave all the love it could impart
His little heart gave none

She took the road to forever
Would she leaving? Never
Maybe she wasn't too clever
But when love finds one it blinds one

He made her journey so exciting
Oh, how the world spun around
Locked in his embrace, lost in time and space
But his never left the ground

This little girl is a sad little girl
Who must endlessly roam
Her little heart went to Loveland
But his fickle heart stayed home
