// Don't Play That Song //

Don't play that song for me
'Cause it brings back memories
Of days that I once knew
The days that I spent with you

Oh no! Don't let them play it (oh no!)
It fills my heart with pain (it hurts!)
Please stop it right away
'Cause I remember just a' what he said

He said, darling (darling I, I love you)
And I know that he lied (darling I, I love you)
You know that you lied (darling I, I love you)
You know that you lied (you lied)
Lied (you lied)
You lied (to me)

Hey mister, don't play it no more
Don't play it no more
I can't stand it
Don't play it no more (no more)
No more (no more)
No more (can't stand it)

I remember on our first date
He kissed me and he walked away
I was only seventeen
I never dreamed he'd be so mean

He told me darling (darling, I love you)
Baby, baby, you lied (darling, I need you)
You, you lied (darling, I love you)
You know that you lied (you lied)
Lied (you lied)
Lied, lied (to me)

O-o-oh darling (darling, I love you)
You know that you lied, yeah (darling, I need you)
You know I know you lied (darling, I love you)
Darling, you lied (you lied)
You lied (you lied)
You lied. You're all that I need. You lied  (to me)
O-u-o-o-o-oh, you lied (don't play it no more)
Hey baby don't play it no more (wo-o-oh, don't play it no more)
Don't do it. Don't play it no more (wo-o-oh, for me)
No more (for me)
I can't stand it no more (don't play it no more)
Ouh! Hey! Don't play it no more (wo-o-oh, don't play it no more)

// The Thrill Is Gone (From Yesterday's Kiss) //

The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
Thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
You done me wrong
Baby, you'll be sorry someday

The thrill is gone
The thrill has gone away from me
The thrill is gone
Oh yeah, the thrill has gone all the way away from me
Although I'm gonna still live on
Gonna be lonely, lonely, lonely as can be

The thrill is gone
Yeah-yeah, the thrill has gone away for good
Oh, the thrill is gone, baby
Yeah-yeah, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone away for good
Somebody told me, although I didn't know it then, that they knew that it would
They knew it would
And I'm free (free)
Free (free) free, free, free, free from all the pain
(Free at last)
Oh, yes I'm free (free) yeah, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free, I'm free (free)
Hey, yeah I'm free from this pain (Thank god almighty, I'm free at last)

And as I leave you, baby
All I wanna do is just wish you well
Gone, gone and gone and gone and gone and, the thrill is gone
The thrill is gone, yeah, baby
Yes, I'm free (free) yeah, I'm free (free)
I'm free (Thank god almighty, I'm free at last)
There's a new world and I'm free from your spell
Free from your spell (free at last)

// Pullin' //

Everyone knew but me, that soon you would be callin' it off and gone;

(I'm... pullin'!) Pullin' on! (Movin'!) Pullin' on in...

And the Lord knows we're gonna be together 'til the end of time, hey, hey...

I know people are gonna try to knock us down,
But we're gonna be strong, ain't gon' let nobody turn us around, oh!

(You and me) will always be joined together for eternity;

// That's All I Want From You //

That's all, that's all I want from you...
That's all, that's all I want from you...
That's all, that's all I want from you...
That's all, that's all I want from you...

All I want is a little bit of love that slowly grows and grows, (Slowly, slowly...)
Not one that comes and goes - That's all I want from you... (Still!)
A sunny day with hopes up to the sky,
A kiss, and no goodbyes - That's all I want from you...

Don't let me down, oh, show me that you care;
Remember when you give, you always get your share...
Don't let me down, I have no time to waste;
Tomorrow may not come (may not come!), when dreamers dream (may not come!) too late...

A little love that slowly grows and grows, (Slowly, slowly...)
Not one that comes and goes - That's all I want from you...

Don't let me down! Show me that you care!
Remember when you give, you always get your share...
Don't let me down, I have no time to waste;
Tomorrow may not come... (may not come!) Dreamers dream... (may not come!) Late...

A little love that slowly grows and grows, (Slowly, slowly...)
Not one that comes and goes - That's all I want from you... (Still!)

Baby, that's all! (That's all, that's all I want from you...)
Baby! (That's all, that's all I want from you...)
(That's all, that's all I want from you...)
Ooh, baby! (That's all, that's all I want from you... slowly, slowly...)

// Oh No Not My Baby //

When my friends told me you had someone new
I didn't believe a single word was true
I showed them all I had a faith in you
I just kept on saying

Oh, no, not my baby
Oh, no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies

My mama told me when rumors spread
There's truth somewhere and I should use my head
But I didn't listen to what she said
I kept right on saying 

Oh, no, not my baby
Oh, no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other boys
Who play with hearts like they were toys

Well, you might have had a last minute fling
But I am sure it didn't mean a thing
'Cause yesterday you gave me your ring
And I'm so glad that I kept on saying

Oh, no, not my baby
Oh, no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other guys 
Who lead you on and tell you lies

Oh, no, not my baby
Oh, no, not my sweet baby
Oh, no, not my baby
Oh, no, not my sweet baby

// Why I Sing The Blues //

Everybody wants to know, they ask me why I sing the blues
Everybody wants to know now, why I keep crying the blues
Well, I've been around little while
And I've paid some dues, yes, I have
People laying in ghetto flats, cold and numb
Looking at roaches, telling bedbugs to move over and give 'em some
Oh, it's hot in here, that's one reason I'm singing the blues, yeah
Been around a long time
God knows I've paid a few dues, yes, I have

Stood in line at the County Hall
Heard a man say: "We're gonna build some high rises for y'all
Up in renewal, work on a removal, talk to me, yeah"
Don't feel bad about it, just trying to be free

I don't want my kids growing up to be no fools
You keep rapping to me y'all ain't got no room in school, yeah
And you want to know why I'm singing the blues, yeah
Been around a little while
And I've seen some people paying dues, yes, I have

Some of my friends told me I was born to lose
But when I looked around they were singing the same old kind of blues, now
And you want to know why I'm singing 'em this evening, yeah
Don't be saying those, everybody pays some dues sometimes
Yeah, sing the blues now
