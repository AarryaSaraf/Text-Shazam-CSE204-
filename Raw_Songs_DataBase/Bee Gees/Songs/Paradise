Lonely people gathering there to be one
Gonna be the last time wasted
Gonna be seen to be gone
Run a mile for the minute
Gonna mind another day without you in it and you

You promised me paradise
Don't go back on your word
No, you
You promised me paradise

All my days of loving you under my skin
Gonna be a wild, wild world
When nobody wants to give in
Gonna call me on the hour
Gonna mind if I don't hear it
I would hate to be you

You promised me paradise
Don't go back on your word
No, you
You promised me paradise

Can you tell me if there's gonna be another reason to cry
Will I be the last to know
Unless we make another way of doing what we do we won't believe it anymore
Will I be the one to cry

Problems, problems haunting me, circle my head
Gonna be a wild world, let me hide away under your bed
Run a mile for the minute
Gonna mind another day without you in it and you

You promised me paradise
Don't go back on your word
No, you
You promised me paradise
You promised me paradise

Ah
Ah
You promised me paradise
You promised me paradise
You promised me paradise
You promised me paradise
