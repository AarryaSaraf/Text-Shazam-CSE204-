Every time I need reality, yeah
In jeopardy of losing all of me

I just am not stronger
Life don't last so long so baby

If you turned out the lights
If you turned out the lights
Please don't turn out the lights
Please don't turn out the lights
Turn out the lights

Baby, I don't feel too reliable
I can only do what I'm liable

But if you want to leave me
Love me and just leave me baby

Turn out the lights
