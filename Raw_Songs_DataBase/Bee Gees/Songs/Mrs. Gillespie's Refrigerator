Talks about the cold on television
Appetizing in the intermission
Let's go look, glued to the screen
There she is, so terribly clean
I love her

Mrs. Gillespie, you know how to sell me
You made me blow my mind with things you tell me
Let's go look, glued to the screen
There she is, so terribly clean
I love her

Now she disappears back to the program
I return to bed, feeling so low down
Someone else is stealing my scene
Fading away into a dream
About her
