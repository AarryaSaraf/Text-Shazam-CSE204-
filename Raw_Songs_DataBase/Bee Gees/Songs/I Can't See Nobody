I walk the lonely streets
I watch the people passing by
I used to smile and say hello
Guess I was just a happy guy
Then you happened, girl
This feeling that possesses me
I just can't move myself
I guess it all just had to be

I can't see nobody...no
I can't see nobody
My eyes can only look at you...you

I used to have a brain
I used to think of many things
I watched the falling rain and listened to the sweet birds sing
Don't ask me why, little girl
I love you and that's all I can say
You're every, every breath I take
You are my nights; my night and day

I can't see nobody...no
I can't see nobody
My eyes can only look at you...you

Every single word you hear
Is coming from this heart of mine
I never felt like this before
A love like yours so young and fine
And now as I try to forget you
It doesn't work out any way
I loved you such a long time ago
But in my eyes you'll always be
Every single word you hear
Is coming from this heart of mine
I loved you such a long time ago
Don't know why
And I don't know why
Baby

I can't see nobody...no
I can't see nobody
My eyes can only look at you...you

I can't see nobody...no
I can't see nobody
My eyes can only look at you...you
