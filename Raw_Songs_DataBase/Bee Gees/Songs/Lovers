Got to make you understand
We'll be lovers, lovers, lovers
I wanna hold you in my hand
We'll be lovers, lovers, lovers

Wanna be a part of you
And I wanna make you part of me (Sweet inspiration)
Oh, we can make it (Make it), make it for the world to see
Don't be blind, time is one our side
And together, we can touch the sky
We can make it if we really try
Ah, together you and I
