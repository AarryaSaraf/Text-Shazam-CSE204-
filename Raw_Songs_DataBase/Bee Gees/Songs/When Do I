Tell me if dreams do come true
If so, then I know that I'm losing you
And you know the address where we live
But I swear there'll be no turning back to you
I won't forgive

When do I and when do I
Know if there's an answer why?
I wonder if I know where I fit in
How do I and how do I
Stop myself from gonna cry?
I wonder if I know where I fit in

Tell me if dreams do come true
If so then I know that I'm losing you
And you know the address where we live
But I swear there'll be no turning back to you
I won't forgive

When do I and when do I
Know if there's an answer why?
I wonder if I know where I fit in
How do I and how do I
Stop myself from gonna cry?
I wonder if I know where I fit in
And when do I and when do I
When do I
When do I know if I fit in?
