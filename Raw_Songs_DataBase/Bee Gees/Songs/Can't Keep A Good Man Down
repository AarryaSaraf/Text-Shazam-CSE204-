No, you can't keep a good man down
When you got a good woman to keep it up
No, you can't stand on firmer ground
When love is the question, I got enough

Ooh, with lips so sweet
Our love just can't be beat, my darling (Oh yeah)
A love like yours and mine can stand the test of time, my darling (Oh yeah)

But for tomorrow
Tomorrow never comes
Love is the secret
Goes living on

No, you can't keep a good man down
When you got a good woman to keep it up
No, you can't stand on firmer ground
When love is the question, I got enough

Just when I need you, show me the way
You came into my world, turned my night to day
What good is a man without a woman?

But for the trouble
Trouble always comes
Love is the secret
Goes living on

No, you can't keep a good man down
When you got a good woman to keep it up
No, you can't stand on firmer ground
When love is the question, I got enough

Ooh, your love is strong
Keep me forever, you're my darling (Oh yeah)
A love like yours and mine can stand the test of time, my darling (Oh yeah)

But for tomorrow
Tomorrow never comes
Love is the secret
Goes living on

No, you can't keep a good man down
When you got a good woman to keep it up
No, you can't stand on firmer ground
When love is the question, I got enough
