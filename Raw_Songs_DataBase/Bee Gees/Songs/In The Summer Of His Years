In the summer of his years
He would always smile
He would laugh every day
If he was here to stay
For the summer of his years

In the daylight of his dreams
He would save his tears
He would always hear
When there was no one near
For the summer of his years

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
For the summer of his years
For the summer of his years
