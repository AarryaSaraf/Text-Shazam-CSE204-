I wasn't born to be alone
That was a lesson I was shown
To know that love was just a lie
I ran away to think it over
But it's over and I try to take a stand on what is real
Someone has shown me how to feel
I'm like a shadow in the night
I'm like a river in an ocean
I'm a flame without a light

And now I'm cryin' every day
And I've been cryin' every day
And I've been thinking of your love
I keep turnin', I keep turnin'
I keep turnin' I keep turnin'
Well your love was a cathedral and I came down here to pray
And now I'm cryin' every day

Can there be any wonder why to be living under
Love is a revelation only few can share
I could be a mountain strong but the pain about you
Long as I live without you
I would still be there
I wanna die, die away, never love, never cry

And I been walkin' in the rain
And I been hangin' on a dream
All the faces and the places that our love has ever been

And now I'm cryin' every day
And I've been cryin' every day
And I've been thinking of your love
I keep turnin', I keep turnin'
I keep turnin' I keep turnin'
Well your love was a cathedral and I came down here to pray
And now I'm cryin' every day

Can there be any wonder why to be living under
Love is a revelation only few can share
I could be a mountain strong but the pain about you
Long as I live without you
I would still be there
I wanna die, die away, never love, never cry

I wasn't born to be a fool but I'm a fool to be around
I'm a man without a country, I'm a King without a crown
And then you're throwin' me away
Another world, another time
But if anyone belongs to anybody - you were mine

I'm cryin' every day
And I've been cryin' every day
And I've been thinking of your love
I keep turnin', I keep turnin'
I keep turnin' I keep turnin'
Well your love was a cathedral and I came down here to pray
And now I'm cryin' every day

I'm cryin', cryin'
I'm cryin' every day, I've been thinking of you love
