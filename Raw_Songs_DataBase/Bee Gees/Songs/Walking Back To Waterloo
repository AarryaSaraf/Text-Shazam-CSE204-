I wish there was another year, another time
When people sang and poems rhymed
Mm, my name could be Napoleon

A thousand ships, a windy sail
So huge and high, it's tall enough to touch the sky
It's beautiful, but hard to find
But I just wasn't born in time

Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin?
If you play indiscreet
You can get a good seat
At the end

I can dream of growing trees
And things that live and grass that's green
In meadows that have never been
But I still place my trust in the Queen

(Oh, tell me)
What is life when a man is pressured
Based on wrong or right?
And I don't know what it means
There must be more we haven't seen

Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin?
If you play indiscreet
You can get a good seat
At the end

Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin?
If you play indiscreet
You can get a good seat
At the end

Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin?
If you play indiscreet
You can get a good seat
At the end
