There's gonna be a party goin' on
We'll meet you at the station
You know the race has just begun

If you don't think that I was born to hold you
Then I'm gonna tell ya loud and clear, 'Baby, I love ya.'
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day of every year. Now

We're gonna climb a mountain
No one is gonna stop me now
My love is like a fountain
I'll take your hand and show you how

If you don't think that I was born to hold you
Then I'm gonna shout it loud and clear ' Baby I love ya'
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day of every year
