I'm on the road to Alaska
Nowhere near Nebraska
But I'm sure if I asked her she'll know

I ain't got no Honey
I'm so short of money
I really really wanna go home

I dialed Oklahoma
Made attempts to phone her
Gave up when I got no reply

I'm on the road to Alaska
Nowhere near Nebraska
But I'm sure if I don't ask her I'll die

I found Cincinnati, out there I was happy
Every single day of my life
I had me a woman, she started to running
I couldn't really make her my wife
She started to show which way she was going
Every single road she could go

I'm on the road to Alaska
Nowhere near Nebraska
But I'm sure if I asked her she'll know

I made Cincinnati
Out there I was happy
Every single day of my life
I had me a woman, she started to running
I couldn't really make her my wife
She started to show which way she was going
Every single road she could go
I'm on the road to Alaska
Nowhere near Nebraska
But I'm sure if I asked her she'll know
I'm sure if I ask her she'll know
I'm sure if I ask her she'll know
