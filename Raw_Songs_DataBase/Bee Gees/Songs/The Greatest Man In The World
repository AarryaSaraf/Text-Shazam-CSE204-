Before I heard your voice
I never heard a sound like that before
I wanna hear it more and more

Take me to heaven
My love is stronger than the wall
I'll climb it 'til I fall
So I can hear you call, your love

I'd be the greatest man in the world
'Cause I can say I got the greatest girl
I'd be the greatest man in the world
'Cause I can say I got the greatest girl

Before I saw your face
I never saw a dream like that before
I wanna see it more and more

Take me to heaven
My love is stronger than the wall
I'll climb it 'til I fall
So I can hear you call, your love

Be the greatest man in the world
'Cause I can say I've got the greatest girl
Be the greatest man in the world
'Cause I can say I got the greatest girl
The greatest girl

Be the greatest man in the world
Oh, be the greatest man in the world
Be the greatest man, the greatest man in the world
The greatest man, be the greatest man in the world
