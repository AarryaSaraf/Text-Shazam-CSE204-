I've never been alone
And I've only seen the sky
Still I know the reason why
I've been thinking it over

I've never climbed a tree
But that's natural for me
And you don't know my name
So I'm thinking it over

And every day I'm learning
The things that are concerning you and I
And if you were beside me
You'd know what's inside me so tell me why
Give me inspiration to clear the situation we've known too long
And if we end up crying then one of us is lying so tell me

Never rode a plane
And I never will again
So 'til then I'll drink the rain
While I'm thinking it over

And every day I'm learning
The things that are concerning you and I
And if you were beside me
You'd know what's inside me so tell me why
Give me inspiration to clear the situation we've known too long
And if we end up crying then one of us is lying so tell me

Never rode a plane
And I never will again
So 'til then I'll drink the rain
While I'm thinking it over
