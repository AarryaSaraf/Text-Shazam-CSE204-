Let there be love
So I can be loved by you
In Paradise Avenue
Let there be life
So everyone lives to love
Let it happen to me and you

I am a man
So take me for what I am
I'll never have everything
But let there be love
Let there be love
Let there be love

I can be nothing
Or I can be something
I've got to give you my life
I'm tired of living
Without your giving
I've got to get you for my wife
Can't hold on much longer
The feeling's getting stronger
I never begged, but I'm begging now

Let there be love
So I can be loved by you
In Paradise Avenue, oh yeah
Let there be life
So we can all live to love
And let it be both of us

I am a man
So take me for what I am
I'll never have everything
But let there be love
Let there be love
Let there be love
