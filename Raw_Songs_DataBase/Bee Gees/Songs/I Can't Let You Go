Do you love me, woman? Truly, do ya?
Can you feel this feeling going through ya?
Are you of the mind that we should live together through this night?
Or tell me you're my virgin queen and it may not be right

But don't make me say
I can't let you go and it's breaking me down
Just thinking of your face
And it won't be around
Just look at me now
I feel a stranger inside
Stealing my pride
I can't let you go
And it's breaking me down
'Cause you won't be around

When all this world of ours is falling apart
I'll keep on hanging on and fixing my heart
'Cause everyone is just like me
They're praying in the sun
And I may be that lucky man surviving when they're gone

But don't make me say
I can't let you go and it's breaking me down
Just thinking of your face
And it won't be around
Just look at me now
I feel a stranger inside
Stealing my pride
I can't let you go
And it's breaking me down
'Cause you won't be around

Just look at me now
I feel a stranger inside
Stealing my pride
I can't let you
Can't let you go
And it's breaking my down
'Cause you won't be around

But don't make me say
I can't let you go and it's breaking me down
Just thinking of your face
And it won't be around
Just look at me now
I feel a stranger inside
Stealing my pride
I can't let you go
And it's breaking me down
'Cause you won't be around

Just look at me now, I can't let you go
Just look at me now, I can't let you go
Just look at me now, I can't let you go
Just look at me now, I can't let you go
