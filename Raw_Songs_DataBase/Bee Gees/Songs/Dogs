I was hungry and I was cold
Had a father far too old
Couldn't make it to the place he'd like to be
In a tree trunk in the park
He was living in the dark
Keeping other dogs like him for company
And in the evening I'd go down
To a nightclub in the town
Try to get some bread to make another way
And back to the park I'd go
Dig him out of the snow
You know he's lived a thousand years
From day to day

Well, the days get shorter
And the nights get longer
And you never learn to know
If you love one another
Could you look at each other
Could it ever really show?
If at this moment in time
You couldn't make up your mind
Now could you ever understand?

Are you following me
Just like Moses to the sea?
Do you think I'll give you freedom in the end?
When I'm long dead and gone
Will your love for me go on?
Will I be the one you run to in the end?
And all my dogs need a friend

It was a quarter to three
In the summer of '73
When I heard somebody call outside my door
Said, "Are you friend or are you foe?"
He looked up and he said, "No
But I'd like to come inside and know you more."

Well, the days get shorter
And the nights get longer
And you never learn to know
If you love one another
Could you look at each other
Could it ever really show?
If at this moment in time
You couldn't make up your mind
Now could you ever understand?

Are you following me
Just like Moses to the sea?
Do you think I'll give you freedom in the end?
When I'm long dead and gone
Will your love for me go on?
Will I be the one you run to in the end?
And all my dogs need a friend
