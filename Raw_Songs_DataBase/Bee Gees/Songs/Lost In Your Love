I was lost in your love
I was held by your heart
And no secrets
Stood between us anymore
I'm like a child, learning pain
I was held by your chains
And my darling
I was lost in your love

There's been a difference of opinion
To the way I've been treating you
But you know that I've tried to apologize
For all the bad times I've put you through
On the chance that I could make you mine
There's not a thing I would not do
And wrong or right I'll be with you
And lost in your love

I was lost in your love
I was held by your heart
And no secrets
Stood between us anymore
I'm like a child, learning pain
I was held by your chains
And my darling
I was lost in your love

Now I will follow you where the wild bird flies
Through endless skies I will go
So I can be so near you girl
And all of this you gotta know
That when I get you
Here inside my arms
I never ever ever will let you go
And wrong or right I'll be with you
And lost in your love

I was lost in your love
I was held by your heart
And no secrets
Stood between us anymore
I'm like a child, learning pain
I was held by your chains
And my darling
I was lost in your love

Lost in your love yes
And you made love feels so
I was lost in your love babe
But you made love feel sacred
You made me feel sacred
Oh you made me feel sacred
You make love sacred
You make me feel so
And I and I gotta tell you
And I gotta tell you
You are making me yourself oh yeah
Oh yeah, you make me feel so good
Ah you make you make me feel so good
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Give me some
Give me some more
Oh you make me feel so good
