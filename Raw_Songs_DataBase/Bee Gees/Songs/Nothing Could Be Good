Baby, when there's only one embrace
One is just enough for two
When do I learn, young fingers get burned
Never, my love (ha ha)

And when everyone has been a friend
Windy day we never knew
Now nothing can stand the way it was planned
No, baby, nothing could be good as
Nothing could be good as loving you

Even though you're far away
Your movie plays in my mind
Your world is what you see
Let it be me
And I can make you warm at night
But I need to be sure you got love enough to know
Ha ha (never)
No (never)

And when every cloud has lost its glow
Raining on my avenue
When do I hide that nothing inside?
When, baby, nothing could be good as
Nothing could be good as loving you

Even though you're far away
Your movie plays in my mind
Your world is what you see
Let it be me
And I can make you warm at night
But I need to be sure you got love enough to know
Ha oh, never (never)
Oh (never)

And when everyone has gone away
Sing to the Almighty if it's what you need to feel (do)
The world is real (true)
And, baby, nothing could be good as
Nothing could be good as loving you

Ha
Loving you
Loving you
Love
I'll be loving you, love
