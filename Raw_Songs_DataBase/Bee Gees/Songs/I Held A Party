I held a party and nobody came
Strangely I was upset
Poured out a drink and then Birkworth approached
Saying, "Have no regrets

Maybe your gentle friends had some delay
Don't try and take on the world."

True

Made up my bed and decided to sleep
Dreaming I was awake
Maybe I drank in excess of my drink
Nice clan cordial crowd

Birkworth suggested we speak through the night
I never knew him so well

Ah ah ah
