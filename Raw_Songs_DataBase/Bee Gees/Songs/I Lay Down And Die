Only last night when your arms held me tight
You told me you thought our love could last forever, forever
I was the one that gave you all my love when I thought
That our love could last forever, forever

I lay down and die
The whole world joins in
And everyone cries
As teardrops begin

I lay down and die

And when darkness falls
Can't see nothing at all

I lay down and die
The whole world joins in
I lay down and die
The teardrops begin

I lay down and die
And die
And die

I lay down and die
The whole world joins in
I lay down and die
And the teardrops begin

I lay down and die
And I lay down and die
