I played the game, still it's not worth it
Like a woman in the rain
I close my eyes
I'm on the shelf
I know myself

I've seen the lights of every city
Tried to work out where I am
I close my mind for the day
I know the way

I played the game, still it's not worth it
Like a woman in the rain
So I close my eyes I'm on the shelf
I know myself

There's never ever anybody to rely on
There isn't time to count the shoulders I have cried on
That's just circumstances, I must take my chances
But, baby you don't know what I'm saying
But I guess that's not true, and you know that's true
But there's a method to my madness

I played the game, still it's not worth it
Like a woman in the rain
So I close my eyes for the day
And all the way
