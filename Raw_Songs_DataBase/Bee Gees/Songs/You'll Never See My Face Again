Every single word has been spoken
It's much too late to change the ways
Far too many vows have been broken
You can't expect a soul to stay

You think that you can stand and lie?
It makes me laugh, you've got no friends
It took a thousand years to find out why
You'll never see my face again

You know that you've been left before this night
It's come my turn to make it over
I wish that every thing was colored white
I wish that I could be a rover

You think that you can stand and lie?
It makes me laugh, you've got no friends
It took a thousand years to find out why
You'll never see my face again

Every single word has been spoken
It's much too late to change the ways
Far too many vows have been broken
You can't expect a soul to stay

You think that you can tell me lies?
It makes me laugh, you've got no friends
It took a thousand years to find out why
You'll never see my face again

You'll never see my face again
You'll never see my face again
You'll never see my face again
You'll never see my face again
