You stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped into my life
And I'm oh so

Before you came my way
I always stepped aside
So afraid of love
And so alone inside
I never thought that I'd
Believe in love so much
But darling, when you came close to me
Suddenly, suddenly

You stepped, you stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped, you stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
I'm crazy 'bout you, girl

You stepped, you stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped, you stepped into my life
And I'm oh so

You will never know
What you have done, my love
You gave me so much more
Than my love is worthy of
Deep in my very soul
I'm living for your touch
Your touch is ecstasy
Close to me
Suddenly, suddenly

You stepped, you stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped, you stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
Stepped into my life (You stepped)
(You stepped)

I feel your arms around me, girl (You stepped)
(You stepped) Aside
(You stepped)
(You stepped)
Know what you've done to me
(You stepped)
(You stepped)
(You stepped)
(You stepped)
