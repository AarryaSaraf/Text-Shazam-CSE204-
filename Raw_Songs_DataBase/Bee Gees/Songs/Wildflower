Wildflower
Sacrifice everything in a wonderland that you know
It's crazy that I'm clear out of my mind
A wonderful place to be

Wildflower
Sweet as the morning light, if I blink an eye, will you go
I'm starting to care much more than I dare
A wonderful thing to see
And what do we know

First say you love me and then say you leave me
But we never say good-bye
God, you're an angel
But even an angel must choose
Someone will hurt you and when you stop running
There's only this love of mine

Wildflower
Sacrifice everything in a wonderland that you know
If older is wise, one look in your eyes
I'm younger than I should be and only time
Waiting for you to grow

First say you love me and then say you'll leave me
But we never say goodbye
God, you're an angel
But only an angel must choose
Someone will hurt you and when you stop running
There's only this love of mine

Wildflower
Sacrifice everything in a wonderland that you know
If older is wise, one look in your eyes
I'm younger than I should be and only time
Waiting for you to grow
