Play you a song

What do you get for trying?
Minute you're born, you're dying
Body is six feet down
The Lord said the soul sticks around

You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord
You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord

You think you live on laughter
But you don't know what's after
Singing hallelujah
I can know the master

You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord
You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord, yeah

When my life is over
Lie in fields of clover
Waiting for my own girl
Living in a new world, yeah

Well, you can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord
You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord

What do you get for trying?
Minute you're born, you're dying
The body is six feet down
The Lord said the soul sticks around

Well, you can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord
You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord

You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord
I'm gonna believe in the Lord
