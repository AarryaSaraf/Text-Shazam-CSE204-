One day, when you're out of line
You'll say, can you spare the time?
Oh, I know you're out of line
Yes, I know you're out of line
And you will say every day
And you will play

Some say there's another day
I'm sure that my thing's OK
Though I know you're out of line
Yes, I know you're out of line
And you will say every day
And you will play

I am your friend

Though I know you're out of line
Yes, I know you're out of line
And you will say every day
And you will say

One day, when you're out of line
You'll say, can you spare the time?
Though I know you're out of line
Yes, I know you're out of line
And you will say every day
And you will play

We say, "Yes." We say, "Yes." We say, "Yes." We say, "Yes." 
We say, "Yes." We say, "Yes." We say, "Yes." We say, "Yes."
