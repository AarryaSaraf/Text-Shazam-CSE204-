// Living Eyes //

Would you believe me if I told you your tomorrow is my yesterday
But be alive
I know that we will
The world keeps on moving but I'm holdin' still

In the beginning, I was far away and praying for my destiny
That would arrive
The moment you're born
For we will be here when the miracle comes

Living eyes, when under the sun don't cry
No war in my mind
The state of my heart
Living eyes, when out in the rain will fall
The day I deny the face of my love

We are of age, we are in time, we are forever
Right now when the power is mine
I leave you heaven and the earth, I leave you never
And living to love is the reason we shine

I been over I been under
I don't own a dream to analyze
But living eyes you know that I do
Believe in the soul and the magic of you

Living eyes, when under the sun don't cry
No war in my mind
The state of my heart
Living eyes, when out in the rain will fall
The day I deny the face of my love

We are of age, we are in time, we are forever
Right now when the power is mine
I leave you heaven and the earth, I leave you never
And living to love is the reason we shine

Living eyes
When under the sun don't cry
No war in my mind
The state of my heart
Living eyes
When out in the rain will fall
The day I deny
The face of my love

Living eyes
When under the sun don't cry
No war in my mind
The state of my heart
Living eyes
When out in the rain will fall
The day I deny
The face of my love

// He's A Liar //

I was stood by the light as I looked through your window
With the greatest intention not meaning to see
I was there in the dark and I saw you together
You were up in his arms, I was down on my knees
Get the cards on the table
No need to pretend
You've got to be cruel to be kind
He can sell you his love and you know, you will pay but

He's a liar
He's a liar, and I should know!
Liar
He's a liar, and I should know, ah!

Well, they told me I fell but I just don't remember
I was standing face down, they were there at my feet
There was smoke in the air and the sweet smell of leather
I was through the window and down in the street
Well, I'm cold and I'm hungry but I'm still alive
And it's not how I want it to be
There's a hand on my shoulder
He said I'll survive but

He's a liar
He's a liar, and I should know!
He's a liar
He's a liar, and I should know, ah!

Was it not for the man that was blocking the drive
Was it not for the red limousine
I'd be millions of miles from the scene of the crime
And somehow in this madness believe she was mine but

I'm a liar
He's a liar, and I should know!
Liar
He's a liar, and I should know!

He's a liar
He's a liar, and I should know!
He's a liar
He's a liar, and I should know!
He's a liar
He's a liar, and I should know!
He's a liar
He's a liar, and I should know!
He's a liar

// Paradise //

Lonely people gathering there to be one
Gonna be the last time wasted
Gonna be seen to be gone
Run a mile for the minute
Gonna mind another day without you in it and you

You promised me paradise
Don't go back on your word
No, you
You promised me paradise

All my days of loving you under my skin
Gonna be a wild, wild world
When nobody wants to give in
Gonna call me on the hour
Gonna mind if I don't hear it
I would hate to be you

You promised me paradise
Don't go back on your word
No, you
You promised me paradise

Can you tell me if there's gonna be another reason to cry
Will I be the last to know
Unless we make another way of doing what we do we won't believe it anymore
Will I be the one to cry

Problems, problems haunting me, circle my head
Gonna be a wild world, let me hide away under your bed
Run a mile for the minute
Gonna mind another day without you in it and you

You promised me paradise
Don't go back on your word
No, you
You promised me paradise
You promised me paradise

Ah
Ah
You promised me paradise
You promised me paradise
You promised me paradise
You promised me paradise

// Don't Fall In Love With Me //

Don't fall in love with me, baby
It's a love that just won't last
Your eyes are lookin' out at the future
But you see the past
You know love was made for a dreamer
But when the dream is out of sight
Well, all you're gonna get in the morning is a lonely night
Gonna be a lonely night, nothing but a lonely night

Saving it all for something wild and wonderful
Holding it down
There's gotta be another horizon
Keep it inside
Don't throw away your precious love
'Cause if you need to be free, you can take it
Not a prison of love that you make it

Don't fall in love with me, baby
It's a love that just can't last
Your eyes are looking out at the future
But you see the past
You know hearts were made to be broken
And your love has broken mine
Now all your gonna get in the morning is a lonely night
Gonna be a lonely night, nothing but a lonely night
Gonna be a lonely night
You gonna be blue (Don't fall, don't fall)
Gonna be a lonely night, nothing but a lonely night
Gonna be a lonely night

Saving it all for something wild and wonderful
Holding it down
There's gotta be another horizon
Keep it inside
Don't throw away your precious love
'Cause if you need to be free, you can take it
Not a prison of love that you make it

Don't fall in love with me, baby
It's a love that just can't last
Your eyes are looking out at the future
But you see the past
You know love was made for a dreamer
And your love has broken mine
Now all your gonna get in the morning is a lonely night
Gonna be a lonely night, nothing but a lonely night
Gonna be a lonely night
You gonna be blue (Fall in love, baby, it's just a love that just can't last)
Gonna be a lonely night, nothing but a lonely night (Lonely, lonely)
Gonna be a lonely night (Alright, all)
You gonna be blue
Gonna be a lonely night, nothing but a lonely night (Lonely, lonely)
Gonna be a lonely night (Alright, all)
You gonna be blue

// Soldiers //

I memorize, I walk in line
I carry my sacrifice for the sake of the millions
All night you be the light on the water
You be the pride and the sorrow
Shower your love to me there

Summer dies before the rain
Unify every soul, together be lonely
Ride on, follow me to the sunrise
Save me the world that is broken
Nothing but love to be there

Soldiers, father and son
We're soldiers, nowhere to run
We fight or we die
For what are we living for
Boys never cry
Soldiers, mother and child
We're soldiers, the meek and the mild
We stand or we fall

Never mind, dry your eyes
You'll never be far away
Forever beside me
Hold out, I will be your tomorrow
I will walk through the fire
Nothing but love to be there

Soldiers, father and son
We're soldiers, nowhere to run
We fight or we die
For what are we living' for
Boys never cry
Soldiers, mother and child
We're soldiers, the meek and the mild
We stand or we fall

I'm a little misunderstood
Living all the daydreams and nightmares
Don't do me no good
I'm a little bit on the moon
But when the word is - you love me
No moment is too soon

All night give me the light on the water
Give me the pride and the sorrow
Showing your love to me there

Soldiers, father and son
We're soldiers, nowhere to run
We fight or we die
For what are we living for
Boys never cry
Soldiers, mother and child
We're soldiers, the meek and the mild
We stand or we fall

Soldiers, father and son
We're soldiers, nowhere to run
We fight or we die
For what are we living for
Boys never cry

Soldiers, mother and child
We're soldiers, the meek and the mild
We stand or we fall
For what are we living for
Boys never cry

// I Still Love You //

Close your eyes do what you wanna
Baby, how can I wait much longer
Make it hard to believe it happened to me
Morning comes too late tomorrow
All you lose is the dream you borrow
All you got is a soul that's born to be free

And cries to the wind, waiting for you
My dream will find you someday
I stand beside my vision of you
And have you loving me

I still love you
(Ah)
I still love you
(Ah)

Though you're my imagination
You'll be there when we find salvation
Only then will there be no reason to hide
Stormy nights, out in the heaven
I believe in the true forever
There's a bright new star when somebody dies

I cry to the wind, waiting for you
Sweet love returning someday
The day you learn love happened to you
You will be here with me

I still love you (I still love you, I still love you)
(Ah) (Ah girl)
I still love you (I love you, I love you)
(Ah)

I'll be waiting for you
Sweet love returning someday
The day you learn love happened to you
You will be here with me

I still love you (I still you, I still you)
(Ah) (Oh)
I still love you (I still you, I still you)
(Ah) (Oh girl)
I still love you (I still need you girl)
(Ah) (Oh girl)
I still love you (Love you, love you, love you)
(Ah)
I still love you
(Ah)

// Wildflower //

Wildflower
Sacrifice everything in a wonderland that you know
It's crazy that I'm clear out of my mind
A wonderful place to be

Wildflower
Sweet as the morning light, if I blink an eye, will you go
I'm starting to care much more than I dare
A wonderful thing to see
And what do we know

First say you love me and then say you leave me
But we never say good-bye
God, you're an angel
But even an angel must choose
Someone will hurt you and when you stop running
There's only this love of mine

Wildflower
Sacrifice everything in a wonderland that you know
If older is wise, one look in your eyes
I'm younger than I should be and only time
Waiting for you to grow

First say you love me and then say you'll leave me
But we never say goodbye
God, you're an angel
But only an angel must choose
Someone will hurt you and when you stop running
There's only this love of mine

Wildflower
Sacrifice everything in a wonderland that you know
If older is wise, one look in your eyes
I'm younger than I should be and only time
Waiting for you to grow

// Nothing Could Be Good //

Baby, when there's only one embrace
One is just enough for two
When do I learn, young fingers get burned
Never, my love (ha ha)

And when everyone has been a friend
Windy day we never knew
Now nothing can stand the way it was planned
No, baby, nothing could be good as
Nothing could be good as loving you

Even though you're far away
Your movie plays in my mind
Your world is what you see
Let it be me
And I can make you warm at night
But I need to be sure you got love enough to know
Ha ha (never)
No (never)

And when every cloud has lost its glow
Raining on my avenue
When do I hide that nothing inside?
When, baby, nothing could be good as
Nothing could be good as loving you

Even though you're far away
Your movie plays in my mind
Your world is what you see
Let it be me
And I can make you warm at night
But I need to be sure you got love enough to know
Ha oh, never (never)
Oh (never)

And when everyone has gone away
Sing to the Almighty if it's what you need to feel (do)
The world is real (true)
And, baby, nothing could be good as
Nothing could be good as loving you

Ha
Loving you
Loving you
Love
I'll be loving you, love

// Cryin' Every Day //

I wasn't born to be alone
That was a lesson I was shown
To know that love was just a lie
I ran away to think it over
But it's over and I try to take a stand on what is real
Someone has shown me how to feel
I'm like a shadow in the night
I'm like a river in an ocean
I'm a flame without a light

And now I'm cryin' every day
And I've been cryin' every day
And I've been thinking of your love
I keep turnin', I keep turnin'
I keep turnin' I keep turnin'
Well your love was a cathedral and I came down here to pray
And now I'm cryin' every day

Can there be any wonder why to be living under
Love is a revelation only few can share
I could be a mountain strong but the pain about you
Long as I live without you
I would still be there
I wanna die, die away, never love, never cry

And I been walkin' in the rain
And I been hangin' on a dream
All the faces and the places that our love has ever been

And now I'm cryin' every day
And I've been cryin' every day
And I've been thinking of your love
I keep turnin', I keep turnin'
I keep turnin' I keep turnin'
Well your love was a cathedral and I came down here to pray
And now I'm cryin' every day

Can there be any wonder why to be living under
Love is a revelation only few can share
I could be a mountain strong but the pain about you
Long as I live without you
I would still be there
I wanna die, die away, never love, never cry

I wasn't born to be a fool but I'm a fool to be around
I'm a man without a country, I'm a King without a crown
And then you're throwin' me away
Another world, another time
But if anyone belongs to anybody - you were mine

I'm cryin' every day
And I've been cryin' every day
And I've been thinking of your love
I keep turnin', I keep turnin'
I keep turnin' I keep turnin'
Well your love was a cathedral and I came down here to pray
And now I'm cryin' every day

I'm cryin', cryin'
I'm cryin' every day, I've been thinking of you love

// Be Who You Are //

Be who you are
Don't ever change
The world was made to measure for your smile
So smile

Those crazy dreams
We threw, we threw away
I've never been alone with you
I never could
They say

That love will find a way
And love will never be set free
And I won't ever let you be
You could not understand
You never will

Be who you are
I bless, I bless your name
And all that summer madness caused the rain
And we, we

The glory that we made
My love will grace the halls of time
For love that never can be mine
You could not love me then
I love you still

Be who you are
Seize life and find a way
And I will be that shadow loving who you are
Be who you are
We were
