// Turn Of The Century //

Everything's happening
At the turn of the century
I'm gonna buy myself a time machine
Go to the turn of the century

And all those people passing by
And the town crier makes his cry
At the turn of the century
Turn of the century

Big wide hats and men is spats
At the turn of the century
With those horseless carriages
At the turn of the century

And there are lots of things to do
On a bicycle built for two
At the turn of the century
Turn of the century

Everything's happening
At the turn of the century
I'm gonna buy myself a time machine
Go to the turn of the century

And all those people passing by
And the town crier makes his cry
At the turn of the century
Turn of the century, turn of the century

// Holiday //

Ooh you're a holiday, such a holiday
Ooh you're a holiday, such a holiday

It's something I think's worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Throwing stones, throwing stones

Ooh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
Can't think what I've just said
Put the soft pillow on my head

Millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
It's unkind, it's unkind

De, de de de de de
De de de de de de, de de
De, de de de de de
De de de de de de, de de

Yet millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
It's unkind, it's unkind

Ooh you're a holiday
Every day, such a holiday
Now it's my turn to say
And I say you're a holiday

It's something I think's worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Throwing stones, throwing stones

De, de de de de de
De de de de de de, de de
De, de de de de de
De de de de de de

// Red Chair Fade Away //

Red chair fade away
Bring back memories
Think of something nice
Fragrant lemon trees

I can feel the speaking sky
I don't want to know
It's filling up the air

Grandpa's fairy tale
Red chair round the fire
Rainbows all the time

We're all going higher
I can feel the speaking sky
I don't want to know
It's filling up the air

Red chair fade away
Red chair fade away
Red chair fade away
Red chair fade away
Red chair fade away

Bring back memories
Think of something nice
Fragrant lemon trees

I can feel the speaking sky
I don't want to know
It's filling up the air
Red chair fade away
Red chair fade away

// One Minute Woman //

One minute, women, please
I'd go down on my knees
To say to you with a word so true
"I love you"

I fail to understand
Why you don't want my hand
I try to find what's on your mind
I wonder

Why don't you stop and see
Why you're not loving me:
Would it hurt to say "Hello"
Or don't you know?

One minute, women, please
I'd go down on my knees
To say to you with a word so true
"I love you"

Why don't you stop and see
Why you're not loving me:
Would it hurt to say "Hello"
Or don't you know?

One minute, women,please
I'd go down on my knees
To say to you with a word so true
"I love you, I love you. I love you."

// In My Own Time //

I received an invitation
'Come to the United Nations'
That was when I was somebody
In my own time

Sitting selling hot cross buns
Thousand suckers everyone
Sounds just like a nursery rhyme
In my own time

Even when the lights go out
Still got things to think about
Memories I can't call mine
In my own time

My own time
My own time

// Every Christian Lion Hearted Man Will Show You //

Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique

Take this in hand
Said he who stands
Behind the chair
A broken table there

Every Christian lion hearted man will show you
Every Christian lion hearted man will show you

Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique

Don't walk so tall
Before you crawl
For every child
Is thinking of something wild

Every Christian lion hearted man will show you
Every Christian lion hearted man will show you

Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique

Every Christian lion hearted man will show you
Every Christian lion hearted man will show you (will show you)

Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique

// Craise Finton Kirk Royal Academy Of Arts //

He smiled and rubbed the stubble on his chin
He sure shall find the weariness and dreariness of life that's growing thin
Yet, he didn't have so very far to go
With a pencil in his hand he will travel on as planned
With a mere step in the mountain to a light

Craise Finton Kirk, see him go, on his way
Oh, they don't know where he is
Very very nice, very very nice

Even in the morning when he slept
Something odd is missing
There's nothing very much to talk about
And nothing very much to see

Craise Finton Kirk, see him go, on his way
Oh, they don't know where he is
Very very nice, very very nice

Talks about the place he'd like to go
And you never see the worrying and hurrying that makes a person slow
Yet, you wouldn't think he'd be so hard to find
Yet, he looks so very busy but there's nothing on his mind
And his wavy hair continues not to grow

Craise Finton Kirk, see him go, on his way
Oh, they don't know where he is
Very very nice, very very nice

Craise Finton Kirk, see him go, on his way
Oh, they don't know where he is
Very very nice, very very nice

// New York Mining Disaster 1941 //

In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew

Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones

I keep straining my ears to hear a sound
Maybe someone is digging underground
Or have they given up and all gone home to bed
Thinking those who once existed must be dead

Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones

In the event of something happening to me
There is something I would like you all to see
It's just a photograph of someone that I knew

Have you seen my wife, Mr. Jones?
Do you know what it's like on the outside?
Don't go talking too loud, you'll cause a landslide, Mr. Jones

// Cucumber Castle //

There were the trees, see the grass, a Pinkerton spy
Said, "This is the place I will try," and he did
Stood in the dark, sat a man who beckoned him in
But leaving his grass was a sin, but he did

Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home
He saw the light in the cellar reflect in his eyes
Yet early that morning was he to receive a surprise

Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home

Said, "Are you leaving or are you receiving my friend
Doest need any money 'til then," and he did
He said, "I'm the owner, not you, and this is my stead
So give it to me now I'm dead, and he did, said:

Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home

// To Love Somebody //

There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be lived with you
Lived with you
There's a way everybody say
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, ain't got? Hey babe

You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

In my brain
I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
And I'm blind, so so sorrily blind
I'm a man, can't you see
What I am
I live and I breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you, ain't got? Hey babe

You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

Ooh

You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

No no no-no no no

You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

// I Close My Eyes //

Look at me I'm riding high
Don't know what's wrong with me
Can't you see I'm not the guy
That I pretend to be

Though I know I will be lonely
But our love will never die
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes
Ah

The more I try the more I fail
I'd like to run away
But if I try you pass me by
I know that I can't stay

Though I know I will be lonely
But our love will never die
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes
Ah

Ah
Though I know I will be lonely
But our love will never die
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes
I close my eyes. I close my eyes. I close my eyes

// I Can't See Nobody //

I walk the lonely streets
I watch the people passing by
I used to smile and say hello
Guess I was just a happy guy
Then you happened, girl
This feeling that possesses me
I just can't move myself
I guess it all just had to be

I can't see nobody...no
I can't see nobody
My eyes can only look at you...you

I used to have a brain
I used to think of many things
I watched the falling rain and listened to the sweet birds sing
Don't ask me why, little girl
I love you and that's all I can say
You're every, every breath I take
You are my nights; my night and day

I can't see nobody...no
I can't see nobody
My eyes can only look at you...you

Every single word you hear
Is coming from this heart of mine
I never felt like this before
A love like yours so young and fine
And now as I try to forget you
It doesn't work out any way
I loved you such a long time ago
But in my eyes you'll always be
Every single word you hear
Is coming from this heart of mine
I loved you such a long time ago
Don't know why
And I don't know why
Baby

I can't see nobody...no
I can't see nobody
My eyes can only look at you...you

I can't see nobody...no
I can't see nobody
My eyes can only look at you...you

// Please Read Me //

Many years ago I was a simple man
A simple man, no worries me
I never lied
Please read me

Not much conversation ever came from me
I never saw reality
I never tried
Please read me

Ah

Maybe I've been lying on your couch too long
I'll stay if you can see me through, explain why
Please read me. Please read me. Please read me

// Close Another Door //

Many years have passed, it seems
And now I am all alone
I've sent the children far away
To some obscure unknown

It's so sad, so sad

Close another door
Listen to my eyes
Close another door
You're much too old to work
So won't you run away?

When I was young, I used to say
That age won't bother me
The life I had was very sad
It all went out to sea

So so sad, so sad

Close another door
Listen to my eyes
Close another door
You're much too old to work
So won't you run away?

And though the sun is in outside
The rain is in my hair
Now all my life is lived inside
My home is there in my chair

So so sad, so sad

Close another door
Listen to my eyes
Close another door
You're much too old to work
So won't you run away?

Let me go, send me flowers
And put me on a plane
I've paid before
So I've been told at least I'm still alive
Fly me young, fly [?]
And get me up
I been working so, so very hard
At being young but now I'm out of time
I'm out, take me home mama
Said I'm worth it, worth it, worth it
I survive

// Gilbert Green //

On a hill, inside a house in covewell reach
Stands a man who's feeling very tired
Looking at a song he wrote some time ago
Could have made it big inside a Broadway show
Every day I go away and find ideas
Think, I'll climb on top of somewhere high
Couldn't I write a song about a man who's dead
Didn't really know if he was off his head

Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes
Too bad for Gilbert Green
We can tell the world that he was right

Sitting in his attic on a sunny day
Mending 50 goblets that are worn

Humming to himself a song of yesteryear
His hearing wasn't good but his eyes were clear

Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes
Too bad for Gilbert Green
We can tell the world that he was right

Now the house is burnt along with Gilbert Green
Sad to see his sisters stand and cry
And in the basement lies a song that wasn't seen
Tells the tale of laughing men and yellow beans

Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes
Too bad for Gilbert Green
Now we can tell the world that he was right

// House Of Lords //

The butler Henry Baker extinguishes the fires
Whilst sir Frederick Harold Robinson casually retires
Another day tomorrow cries Alan crayon steel
All must be up early to have the morning meal
The maid comes with decanter and to the butler there
Said, 'Sir, here's what you ordered.'
He said, 'No one seems to care.'

It must be good to live in the house of lords
It must be good to live in the house of lords

The house is now in darkness before the coming day
But at five o'clock that morning, the master passed away

The housemaid drew the curtains and the doctors watched the dawn
And the brother Bendix sadly watched the gardener mow the lawn

It must be sad to live in the house of lords
It must be sad to live in the house of lords

Grandma Mildred Marshall was pouring out the tea
When she heard about the news of sir Frederick's tragedy
The hall is now in sadness and everybody cried
On the banks of Burntley river is where sir Frederick lies

It must be sad to live in the house of lords
It must be sad to live in the house of lords

// All Around My Clock //

Watching all the hours
Counting all the flowers that I grow
Think I'm slow

Sitting on the inside
Watching all the outside people go
Think I'm slow

Dreaming all around my clock
Dreaming all around my clock... in the night time

Mr. Weeping Willow lazing on my pillow knows my mind deep inside
Tells me all the stories listens to the worries that I tried to keep inside

Dreaming all around my clock
Dreaming all around my clock... in the night time

Da na na na na na-na
Na-na na na na da-da-da

Dreaming all around my clock
Dreaming all around my clock... in the night time

Think about the sunshine
Thinking of the night I'm on my own
Private phone

Watering the garden
Trying not to harden things that grow
Think I'm slow

Dreaming all around my clock
Dreaming all around my clock... in the night time

Dreaming all around my clock
Dreaming all around my clock... in the night time
