// Charade //

Summer nights
We made our love in the sand
And at the dawn
We held our love hand in hand
And we listened
To music the ocean was playing
The words that our two hearts were saying
That only two lovers can hear

Let us ride on the wind
While this moment is real
You're the light of my life
You are welcome to my charade

And this feeling
Knowing you blessed me forever
And believing
I have been touched by your love

And the pleasure of knowing
That evening won't tear us apart

We can follow the sun
Till the daylight is gone
We can gaze at the sky
Till the night is over
Light of my life
You are welcome to my charade

And this feeling
Of knowing you've blessed me forever

We can follow the sun
Till the daylight is gone
We can gaze at the sky
Till the night is over
Light of my life
You are welcome to my charade

And this feeling
Knowing you've blessed me forever

We can follow the sun
Till the daylight is gone
We can gaze at the sky
Till the night is over
Light of my life
You are welcome to my charade

// Throw A Penny //

Little child, I have found
If I stood up and looked around
I'd see a brand-new face staring right back at me
I believe, I am sure
That I'm taller than I was before
Building a brand-new bridge into sincerity
But it's the times like this, we must learn to grow

Throw a penny for my children, they are going down
When the light shines down much brighter, many souls are found
And I can't believe what they're saying in the overground
Throw a penny for my children going down

Listen to the wise man as he breathes
He's really loving me (loving me)
He must be loving me (loving me)
At night, I turn my face into the wind
And I whisper secretly, what means the most to me
And bring him close

Make it bad, make it good
Make it easy to be understood
I see a velvet day breaking across the sky
I believe, I am sure
I am taller than I was before
Building a brand-new bridge
I know I'm gonna try
But it's the times like this, we must find out why

Throw a penny for my children they are going down
When the light shines down much brighter, many souls are found
And I can't believe what they're saying in the overground
Throw a penny for my children going down

Throw a penny for my children, for my children going down
Throw a penny for my children, for my children going down
Throw a penny for my children, for my children going down
Throw a penny for my children, for my children going down

// Down The Road //

I don't need anybody. I don't need anyone
Take it nice and easy mama, chicken on the run and I don't care
I'd show my body anywhere
Ain't no big city winner's gonna pass my buck anywhere
Ain't no four leaf clover's gonna settle my luck and I don't care

Go down to the courthouse and I've been on display
Don't you think that I don't know
It ain't been a perfect day, but I don't care
I'd sell my body anywhere
In the name of creation, I can't find an explanation anywhere
Ain't no easy rider gonna settle my luck and I don't care

Down, down the road, up the road
Down, down the road, up the road

Been rejuvenated to the highest degree
Ain't no words describing what this feeling's done to me and I don't care
I'd show my feelings anywhere
Ain't no heavy Mister Leather's gonna paddle my butt anywhere
Ain't no four leaf clover's gonna settle my luck and I don't care

Down, down the road, up the road
Down, down the road, up the road

Down, down the road, up the road
Down, down the road, up the road
Down, down the road, up the road
Down, down the road, up the road
Down, down the road, up the road

// Voices //

Sweet voices calling wild, echoing around this child
Sweet Faith I'll be joining you, when my story's over
Dee doo doo doo dah dee doo doo
Doo doo doo dee doo doo doo dee doo dah day

Small secrets in the wind, blowing 'til the end begins
Oh my children stand by me 'til my story's over
Dee doo doo doo dah dee doo doo
Doo doo doo dee doo doo doo dee doo dah day

If I were you and you were me those voices they would cease to be
They won't be free to torment me again
But in my bed again last night, those voices spoke of wrong and right
They spoke of darkness and of light
They spoke of weakness and of might
They spoke of people in the snow
And distant places long ago
They spoke of fire and falling rain
Of health and wealth and death and pain

Nah

Sweet voices calling wild, echoing around this child
Sweet Faith I'll be joining you, when my story's over

If I were you and you were me those voices they would cease to be
They won't be free to torment me again
But in my bed again last night those voices spoke of wrong and right
They spoke of darkness and of light
They spoke of weakness and of might
They spoke of people in the snow
And distant places long ago
They spoke of fire and falling rain
Of health and wealth and death and pain

They spoke of people in the snow
And distant places long ago
They spoke of fire and falling rain
Of health and wealth and death and pain

// Give A Hand, Take A Hand //

I wish the world was run by all the little children
We could be happy once again
We won't hurt when we're like little children
And we won't ever feel the pain

Now when my fight for life on earth is over
And I leave 'cause I can't stay
All my love belongs to you hereafter
And we'll all join hands another day

Everybody's got to give a hand
Everybody's got to take a hand
Everybody's got to fall in love, yeah
To make everybody understand
Everybody's got to give, take a hand

I love you, yes, I do, I told you a million times now
Now, do you believe the words I say?
All my life belongs to you hereafter
And we'll all join hands another day

Everybody's got to give a hand
Everybody's got to take a hand
Everybody's got to fall in love, yeah
To make everybody understand
Everybody's got to give, take a hand

Everybody's got to give a hand
Everybody's got to take a hand
Everybody's got to fall in love, yeah
To make everybody understand
Everybody's got to give, take a hand

// Dogs //

I was hungry and I was cold
Had a father far too old
Couldn't make it to the place he'd like to be
In a tree trunk in the park
He was living in the dark
Keeping other dogs like him for company
And in the evening I'd go down
To a nightclub in the town
Try to get some bread to make another way
And back to the park I'd go
Dig him out of the snow
You know he's lived a thousand years
From day to day

Well, the days get shorter
And the nights get longer
And you never learn to know
If you love one another
Could you look at each other
Could it ever really show?
If at this moment in time
You couldn't make up your mind
Now could you ever understand?

Are you following me
Just like Moses to the sea?
Do you think I'll give you freedom in the end?
When I'm long dead and gone
Will your love for me go on?
Will I be the one you run to in the end?
And all my dogs need a friend

It was a quarter to three
In the summer of '73
When I heard somebody call outside my door
Said, "Are you friend or are you foe?"
He looked up and he said, "No
But I'd like to come inside and know you more."

Well, the days get shorter
And the nights get longer
And you never learn to know
If you love one another
Could you look at each other
Could it ever really show?
If at this moment in time
You couldn't make up your mind
Now could you ever understand?

Are you following me
Just like Moses to the sea?
Do you think I'll give you freedom in the end?
When I'm long dead and gone
Will your love for me go on?
Will I be the one you run to in the end?
And all my dogs need a friend

// Mr. Natural //

Burning embers, I still remember
All of those little things
But I don't feel it so much
'Cause I am so out of touch
With my heart and it won't sing
Rusty rainbows
That's how the pain goes
Turning me inside out
Well, I come home at night
And you are out of my sight
Yes, I'm dying and there ain't no doubt
Well, I'm dying and there's no way out

Well, I try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby
When I walk in the rain you won't know that I'm crying
A smile on my face and I'm trying

I'm trying to understand
That a love that is lost can never be found again
And you see me dance, I look like a happy man

Just when I think I'm getting it over
An old friend I should see
He said he knew you well
And baby I could tell
You know, he knew you even more than me
I went home laughing
And inside I'm crying
We had a special thing
You know I loved you so much
But girl I'm so out of touch
With my heart and it won't sing
You know my heart just won't sing

Well, I try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby
When I walk in the rain you won't know that I'm crying
A smile on my face and I'm trying

I'm trying to understand
That a love that is lost can never be found again
And you see me dance, I look like a happy man

Still I try, try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby
Well, I try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby
Well, I try, try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby
Well, I try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby
Well, I try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby

// Lost In Your Love //

I was lost in your love
I was held by your heart
And no secrets
Stood between us anymore
I'm like a child, learning pain
I was held by your chains
And my darling
I was lost in your love

There's been a difference of opinion
To the way I've been treating you
But you know that I've tried to apologize
For all the bad times I've put you through
On the chance that I could make you mine
There's not a thing I would not do
And wrong or right I'll be with you
And lost in your love

I was lost in your love
I was held by your heart
And no secrets
Stood between us anymore
I'm like a child, learning pain
I was held by your chains
And my darling
I was lost in your love

Now I will follow you where the wild bird flies
Through endless skies I will go
So I can be so near you girl
And all of this you gotta know
That when I get you
Here inside my arms
I never ever ever will let you go
And wrong or right I'll be with you
And lost in your love

I was lost in your love
I was held by your heart
And no secrets
Stood between us anymore
I'm like a child, learning pain
I was held by your chains
And my darling
I was lost in your love

Lost in your love yes
And you made love feels so
I was lost in your love babe
But you made love feel sacred
You made me feel sacred
Oh you made me feel sacred
You make love sacred
You make me feel so
And I and I gotta tell you
And I gotta tell you
You are making me yourself oh yeah
Oh yeah, you make me feel so good
Ah you make you make me feel so good
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Give me some
Give me some more
Oh you make me feel so good

// I Can't Let You Go //

Do you love me, woman? Truly, do ya?
Can you feel this feeling going through ya?
Are you of the mind that we should live together through this night?
Or tell me you're my virgin queen and it may not be right

But don't make me say
I can't let you go and it's breaking me down
Just thinking of your face
And it won't be around
Just look at me now
I feel a stranger inside
Stealing my pride
I can't let you go
And it's breaking me down
'Cause you won't be around

When all this world of ours is falling apart
I'll keep on hanging on and fixing my heart
'Cause everyone is just like me
They're praying in the sun
And I may be that lucky man surviving when they're gone

But don't make me say
I can't let you go and it's breaking me down
Just thinking of your face
And it won't be around
Just look at me now
I feel a stranger inside
Stealing my pride
I can't let you go
And it's breaking me down
'Cause you won't be around

Just look at me now
I feel a stranger inside
Stealing my pride
I can't let you
Can't let you go
And it's breaking my down
'Cause you won't be around

But don't make me say
I can't let you go and it's breaking me down
Just thinking of your face
And it won't be around
Just look at me now
I feel a stranger inside
Stealing my pride
I can't let you go
And it's breaking me down
'Cause you won't be around

Just look at me now, I can't let you go
Just look at me now, I can't let you go
Just look at me now, I can't let you go
Just look at me now, I can't let you go

// Heavy Breathing //

Well, this is my last connection. I been slowing up the line
Ain't no satisfaction in this troubled head of mine
Gotta get back to the highway, gonna get back to where I know
'Cause sooner or later there's gonna be a showdown
Gotta go, man, gotta go

Hell, I'm so so tired, so so tired
And I don't know where I'm gonna start
It's only heavy breathing in the dark

Ain't nobody's sweetheart, ain't nobody's fool
And if the sun don't set on my house, babe
I'd be the last man to blow my cool
I feel my body shake
Well, there's so much left to say
Spend my life anticipating
Gonna find a way

Hey, I'm so so tired, so so tired
And I don't know where I'm gonna start
It's only heavy breathing in the dark

So so tired
So so tired
And I don't know where I'm gonna start
Only heavy breathing in the dark
Only heavy breathing in the dark
It's only heavy breathing in the dark

Well, I don't believe in everything you say just to save my soul
You know there's got to be a way better than a big black hole
Gotta take me from my suicide
Now you know it's love I crave
You know we got to live like this from the cradle to the grave

So so so so tired
So so so so tired
I'm so so so so tired

So so so so tired
So so so so tired
I'm so so so so tired

// Had A Lot Of Love Last Night //

Ah, I had a lot of love last night
Ah
Ah, I had a lot of love last night
Ah
Ah

I've given all my love away and I've been left with none
But can you say that I'm to blame for loving anyone
I used to think that I was always older than my time
We're all breaking promises, who will cry this time
We're all breaking promises, who will cry this time

Ah, I had a lot of love last night
(Had a lot a lot of love)
Ah
Ah, I had a lot of love last night
(Had a lot a lot of love)
Ah

I'm casting all my dreams hereto, my fish have gone to sea
And fate no longer has the faith to walk ahead of me
I always used to think that I was better than my kind
We're all breaking promises, who will cry this time
We're all breaking promises, who will cry this time

Ah, I had a lot of love last night (had a lot a lot of love)
Ah, I had a lot of love last night
