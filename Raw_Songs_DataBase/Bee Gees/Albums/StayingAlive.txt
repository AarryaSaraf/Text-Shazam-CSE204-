// The Woman In You //

The woman in you brings out
The man in me
It's the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy

But baby sharper than a knife
Help me to know you
Show me the night to satisfy
A sinner with the flash of an eye
There'll never be enough to me

I never knew love could wind me up
I can't do my stuff
'Til you go walkin' by
And maybe old enough to try

I never knew anyone in between
The devil and the angel
All in one and maybe old
Enough that I can ride
Your love let me burn
Let me slide down to your soul
You can pull me in
You can push me out

But your baby needs love
Somebody to hold
Show me what to do
The woman in you brings out
The man in me
It's the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy

But baby, stronger than the wind born
In the fire out of the night
I'll teach you how to tremble
If you give me the right
There'll never be enough to me

I never knew I could find the best
But searchin' out the rest there
Is no doubt and maybe we can
Sweat it out

I never knew we could find
A way this crazy situation
Over me and we forget about
The world outside
My love in your eyes
There's no world
There is no time
You can hold me in
You can throw me down

But your baby needs love
Somebody to love
Show me what to do
The woman in you brings out
The man in me
It's the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy

But baby, stronger than the wind born
In the fire out of the night
I'll teach you how to tremble
If you give me the right
There'll never be enough to me

The woman in you brings out
The man in me
It's the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy

The woman in you brings out
The man in me
It's the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy

The woman in you brings out
The man in me
It's the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy

// I Love You Too Much //

You say you don't need me
I know where your love goes
You go missing after midnight
I should know better and the bed is cold
And if you think I'm not the real thing
I don't wanna die of hunger
I got my world created for you
But you don't stay
Not my imagination no more
I can't be dealing with the bad girl
Lives in your head
You got your someone I, don't cry
You go and take a strangers love instead

Over you is where I should be
I could be loving you too much
Under me is where you should be
I could be loving you too much

You know I love the way you do it
When you do it right
You ain't no one man woman
Were you ever
If you don't come back running
When you've had enough
And baby, you got it, I want it
Show me what's left of your love

Over you is where I should be
I could be loving you too much
Under me is where you should be
I could be loving you too much

I won't be no dirty weekend
I stay with you for good
He can be your outside lover
I've got eyes
I know he's in your blood
Just let me hold you for the hour
I go where you lead me
I need some inspiration from you
I'm ready for the mystery, take me
Don't let me fall
Don't let me drown down here in the rain
There is no alibi, don't lie
You love a stranger and the world is pain

Over you is where I should be
I could be loving you too much
Under me is where you should be
I could be loving you too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)

// Breakout //

It don't matter who you are
Anyone can be a star
Brighter than the lightning
You go as far as you go
You got to be what you know

There may be somebody out to get the better of you
You need the one good woman to keep you alive
Don't let the pressure beat a hole in your head
Remember nobody left you on the railway line
And if the one shoe fits you've got a chance this time

Breakout
Ain't no one gonna break your heart
You'll never do it if you never start
You be there
Breakout now
You gotta be a story told
And baby, no one gonna steal your soul
You be there
If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night
You've got it all and then you're lost in flight

There are diamonds in the street
But you don't get enough to eat
Walking on a wire
There is a future unknown
Nobody does it alone

And maybe you can be the thunder
If you follow your dream
There must be one good woman to show you the way
Don't let them make you feel you're less than you are
Remember, somebody calls you on the telephone line
And all the world gets crazy and you win this time

Breakout
Ain't no one gonna break your heart
You'll never do it if you never start
You be there
Breakout now
You gotta be the story told
And baby, no one's gonna steal your soul
You be there
If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night
You've got it all and then you're lost in flight

Breakout now
Ain't no one gonna break your heart
You'll never do it if you never start
You be there
Breakout now
You gotta be the story told
And baby, no one's gonna steal your soul
You be there
If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night

Breakout now
You gotta be the story told
And baby, no one's gonna steal your soul
You be there
If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night

// Someone Belonging To Someone //

I know how I feel
Lonely in the black of night
There can be no love for me now
Nobody listens when the words ain't right
And you get into someone else
It's hard for me to know
Who's lovin' who
And where do I stand
What did I do it all for
There's no one I could love more
I did it for your heart alone
All that I try to be growin' inside to me
I can be strong if you're there

And there is someone belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to me
I live in a world where the face of an angel is all that a fool can see
You got the power to find me whenever I'm lost
Where are you? Who are we?

I believe in time
Can eat away a heart of stone
And baby if I leave you too late
It's just a feather and the bird has flown
It's colder when the fire dies
With all the trouble I'm in if I lose you too
Then what is my life
If I don't wanna go through
Anything without you
Couldn't be life at all
I could be lyin' on
You are the only one
We didn't make it by chance

And there is someone belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to me
I'm caught in a world on the edge of tomorrow
It's all that a fool can find
I don't belong in the arms of a love that is lost
Nowhere to cry
There must be something we can say my love
Something except goodbye

Then what is my life
If I don't wanna go through
Anything without you
Couldn't be life at all
I could be lyin' on
You are the only one
We didn't make it by chance

And there is someone belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to me
And there is someone belonging to someone
And I got no one belonging to me

// Life Goes On //

Pardon me, if I use you in my dreams
You throw those angel eyes at me
Or could the beautiful woman be more than she seems
But she is not in love with me
All of my life I been looking for someone to carry my love away
A chip on my shoulder, a misery, suddenly there you are
Nobody knows, but she knows that I love her
It's got to be growing
I can't wait no longer

Life goes on for the lonely man
When love goes wrong only love knows why
Life goes on for the lonely man
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons
You and I, I

Suddenly, all the world gets in the way
You disappear into the crowd
Maybe the beautiful woman never really came
But I still call your name out loud
I wanna know you, but I never met you
Reality can be cruel
If a wandering soul meets another
They shouldn't be separated
Better in love with your head on my shoulder
But I'll never be satisfied
And if I can't see you

Life goes on for the lonely man
When love goes wrong, only love knows why
Life goes on for the lonely man
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons
You and I, I

Living your life in someone else's heart
A lover's dream that has no end
There may be somebody you can base your world upon
I'll never be the same again
And there's a part of me here
And there's a part of me with you
But all of me loves you
Nobody gave me the feeling you gave me
I'm so proud of
All of my days I will be here for you
And the love keeps running
And if I can't hold you

Life goes on for the lonely man
And there's a million words for the one goodbye
Life goes on for the lonely man
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons
You and I, I
Life goes on for the lonely man
And there's a million words for the one goodbye
Life goes on for the lonely man
We'll be the dreams, we'll be the seasons
You and I, I
