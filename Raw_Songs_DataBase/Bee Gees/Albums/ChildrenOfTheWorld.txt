// You Stepped Into My Life //

You stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped into my life
And I'm oh so

Before you came my way
I always stepped aside
So afraid of love
And so alone inside
I never thought that I'd
Believe in love so much
But darling, when you came close to me
Suddenly, suddenly

You stepped, you stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped, you stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
I'm crazy 'bout you, girl

You stepped, you stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped, you stepped into my life
And I'm oh so

You will never know
What you have done, my love
You gave me so much more
Than my love is worthy of
Deep in my very soul
I'm living for your touch
Your touch is ecstasy
Close to me
Suddenly, suddenly

You stepped, you stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped, you stepped into my life
And I'm oh so happy
You stepped into my life
Stepped into my life
Stepped into my life (You stepped)
(You stepped)

I feel your arms around me, girl (You stepped)
(You stepped) Aside
(You stepped)
(You stepped)
Know what you've done to me
(You stepped)
(You stepped)
(You stepped)
(You stepped)

// Love So Right //

She came on like the night
And she held on tight
And the world was right when she made love to me
We were free
She moved in like a friend
Started loving me
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up
I was here and she was gone
Now I'm hanging on
Maybe you can tell me

How a love so right
Can turn out to be so wrong
Oh, my darling (Oh, my darling)
How a love so right
Can turn out to be so wrong

Where did she go
When I need her close to me?
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever
And you came to break my heart
Now I'm hanging on
On the chance that you'll come back to me, oh, my love

How a love so right
Can turn out to be so wrong (So wrong)
Oh, my darling (Oh, my darling)
How a love so right (A love so)
Can turn out to be so wrong (So wrong)
Oh, my darling

I could take it in my stride
Start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes
And break it down to size
It isn't really fair

How a love so right
Can turn out to be so wrong (So wrong)
Oh, my darling
How a love so right (Love so right)
Can turn out to be so wrong (So wrong)
Oh, my darling
How a love so right (How a love, a love so right)
Can turn out to be so wrong
Oh, my darling
How a love so right (How a love so right)
Can turn out to be so wrong (Can turn out, turn out to be so wrong, so wrong)
Oh, my darling (So wrong)
How a love so right (How a love so right)
Can turn out to be so wrong (Can turn out, to be so, be so wrong, turn out to be so wrong)
Oh, my darling
How a love so right
Can turn out to be so

// Can't Keep A Good Man Down //

No, you can't keep a good man down
When you got a good woman to keep it up
No, you can't stand on firmer ground
When love is the question, I got enough

Ooh, with lips so sweet
Our love just can't be beat, my darling (Oh yeah)
A love like yours and mine can stand the test of time, my darling (Oh yeah)

But for tomorrow
Tomorrow never comes
Love is the secret
Goes living on

No, you can't keep a good man down
When you got a good woman to keep it up
No, you can't stand on firmer ground
When love is the question, I got enough

Just when I need you, show me the way
You came into my world, turned my night to day
What good is a man without a woman?

But for the trouble
Trouble always comes
Love is the secret
Goes living on

No, you can't keep a good man down
When you got a good woman to keep it up
No, you can't stand on firmer ground
When love is the question, I got enough

Ooh, your love is strong
Keep me forever, you're my darling (Oh yeah)
A love like yours and mine can stand the test of time, my darling (Oh yeah)

But for tomorrow
Tomorrow never comes
Love is the secret
Goes living on

No, you can't keep a good man down
When you got a good woman to keep it up
No, you can't stand on firmer ground
When love is the question, I got enough

// Love Me //

I remember times, my love, when we really had it all
You were always there to make me smile, help me when I fall
Ooh, I can't believe you're leaving me
When there's so much more to say

I can't let you go
Ooh, every time I look at you, I still can feel the glow
Let it be, let it grow

Ooh, love me please, just a little bit longer
Together, we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me please, just a little bit harder

All I ever wanted was to have you to myself
Then I see you standing there in the arms of someone else
You know a man can stand so much
And it's more than I can bear

I can't let you go
Ooh, every time I look at you, I still can feel the glow
Let it be, let it grow

Ooh, love me please, just a little bit longer
Together, we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me please, just a little bit harder

Never even try to see things her way
It's hard on a woman when love ain't no love at all
And when she walks away (No, no)
And she probably will
You're gonna be sorry, begging her, "Please"

Love me please, just a little bit longer
Together, we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me please, just a little bit harder

I think I can work it out
I can't get enough, I want you tomorrow

Love me please, just a little bit longer
Together, we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me please, just a little bit longer
Together, we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me please, just a little bit longer
Together, we can make it
Our love is much too young to break it
Love me please, just a little bit longer
Together, we can make it

// Subway //

Take me to the subway
Ooh, take me to the subway

It ain't far away, but the night is mine
Like it fine, gonna stay
See you in the morning
Gotta rush, get a bus, make a fuss
Gimme some loving in the morning

Ooh, she makes me feel so good
Instant reaction and ready for love
I got no work, no sweat, no strain
I got to make it to the midnight train

So, take me to the subway, ah
Ooh, take me to the subway

Ooh, city-life is bittersweet
I don't care, take me there on the street
Freedom in the city
Gotta ride, going down underground
Watch me slide, loving in the city

Ooh, she makes me so complete
Heavy in love and light on my feet
I got no work, no sweat, no strain
I got to make it to the midnight train

Take me to the subway, ah-ah
Ooh, take me to the subway
Ah-ah-ah

Ooh, it ain't far away, but the night is mine
Like it fine, gonna stay
See you in the morning
Gotta rush, get a bus, make a fuss
Gimme some loving in the morning

Ooh, she makes me feel so good
Instant reaction and ready for love
I got no work, no sweat, no strain
I got to make it to the midnight train

So, take me to the subway, ah-ah
Ooh, take me to the subway, ah-ah

Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh)
Hey, hey, hey, hey (Hey)
Hey

// The Way It Was //

I don't know how, but nights get lonely now
They keep appearing in my eyes
Such a warm and tender glow
For just one moment, I remember all
The love we had was never all that bad
There were smiles and there were tears
On that special, starry night, with your arms around me
Held on tight

Wasn't that the way it was?
Two strangers reaching for a worthless cause
Wasn't that the love we shared
Or just the restless years when no one cared?

I don't know why it's hard to say goodbye
Or even justify the end
You meant so very much to me
Then to let you go, start my life again
The love we had was never all that bad
There were smiles and there were tears
'Til that special summer day
When I reached out for you, you just walked away

Wasn't that the way it was?
Two strangers reaching for a worthless cause
Wasn't that the love we shared
Or just the restless years when no one cared?

// Children Of The World //

Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life
Keeps us all anticipating
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are searchers of the truth
Every man's a boy deep down
Gotta say it how you mean it
There ain't no easy way

Like a bird in the wind, like a tree in the storm
Like the breath of a child from the moment he's born
'Til the very last day when the curtains are drawn

Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Asking every question why
From arrival to survival
Just to make it worth the waiting
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are faces in the night
Watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life
There ain't no easy way

In the back of your mind, there is always a mark
There's a wandering soul all alone in the dark
You can keep it forever or tear it apart

Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by
Changing my life, changing your life
Keeps us all anticipating
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by

Like a bird in the wind, like a tree in the storm
Like the breath of a child from the moment he's born
'Til the very last day when the curtains are drawn

Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life
Keeps us all anticipating
Ah, ah-ah-ah
We are children of the world
Watching every day go by
Changes my life, changes your life
Keeps us all anticipating
