// Saw A New Morning //

All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I'm locked-up. I wanna be free
Out in the courtyard and over the wall then
My friends are waiting for me

Sixteen people are waiting to get me
Hoping to take me outside
I hear the sound of the snub nose behind me
I went along for the ride

Wind in my face and my bones. They are aching
My soul must weather the storm
I must run 'til my back. It is breaking
Desperately I must keep on

Sixteen people are waiting to get me
Hoping to take me outside
I hear the sound of the snub nose behind me
I went along for the ride

All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I went along for the ride

All of a sudden I saw a new morning
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
All of a sudden I saw a new morning
I saw a new morning
I saw a new morning
I saw a new morning

// I Don't Wanna Be The One //

It's too late to turn back now
There ain't no space back there
And how did I begin to lose my self control
How did I begin to lose my self control

There ain't a thing that you could give me
With the love forever with me
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul

I don't wanna be the one
Remember it was only fun
Two strangers touching in the sun, it had to end
I don't wanna be the guy to tell you things that make you cry
You know as well as I know, you're my only friend

There ain't a thing that you could give me
With the love forever with me
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul

I don't wanna be the one
Remember it was only fun
Two strangers touching in the sun, it had to end
I don't wanna be the guy to tell you things that make you cry
You know as well as I know, you're my only friend

I don't wanna be the guy to tell you things that make you cry
You know as well as I know you're my only friend
You know as well as I know you're my only friend
You're my only friend
My only friend
My only friend

// South Dakota Morning //

The sun shines down on a South Dakota morning
And I can see their faces in my eyes
I wish they were behind me
My enemy can find me
If only to remind me
That I'm really not alone
All the South Dakota mornings I have known

The eagle flies on a South Dakota morning
And I don't see my eagle anymore
Now stranger I must kill you
You must survive but will you
I may just beat you down
But will it even up the score
I think I saw the eagle just once more

The rain comes down on a South Dakota morning
And I can't see the sadness in my town
So let it be my pillow
For underneath your willow
Wanna go back to you though
You're nothing but a town
On the South Dakota grass I lay me down
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah

// Living In Chicago //

If you're happy and marching forward in your band
Holding hands together, I will understand
In my life I'm together on my own
With my own private eggshell and my phone

If your mind is in the darkness, could you know
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow?
Will you show me someone who may treat me kind
Or is this world I live in just a frame of mind?

If you're living in Chicago, it's your home
If you're living in Chicago, you're alone

If you're happy living down on the ground
Where the crippled and the blind alone can see
I got a feeling God is still around
And if I'm right, there must be more than this to see

If your mind is in the darkness, could you know
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow?
Will you show me someone who may treat me kind
Or is this world I live in just a frame of mind?

And as soon as you discover where you're going
Can I walk along the way, along the way?
I'm lonesome and I need somebody knowing
Just a few nice words to get me through the day

If your mind is in the darkness, could you know
If it suits you to be fast or far too slow?
Will you show me someone who may treat me kind
Or is this world I live in just a frame of mind?

If you're living in Chicago, it's your home
If you're living in Chicago, you're alone

If you're living in Chicago, you're alone
If you're living in Chicago, it's your home
If you're living in Chicago, it's your home
If you're living in Chicago, it's your home
If you're living in Chicago, it's your home
If you're living in Chicago, it's your home

// While I Play //

I cry tears of emotion
To spread across the U.S.A.
Ain't no sunshine cowboy
In your pockets
I'll make my own way while I play

Baby you forgot you're living
Someone covered up your eyes
In my way at least I'm giving
What I love, am I wise?

There's gonna be some confusion
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes
And you'll look to the skies
And you'll pray, while I play

I am my father's son
Or that is what I heard
Maybe I got it wrong
I didn't mean a word
You got my face and I'll play your ace
Pretend I haven't heard

There's gonna be some confusion
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes
And look to the skies
And you'll pray, oh while I play

I am a minstrel
That is all I want to be
I'll play inside your soul
I'll show you to yourself
I'll fill your head with wild emotions
A symphony in wealth

There's gonna be some confusion
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes
And look to the skies
And you'll pray, while I play

I will take my leave
I gotta move on time
I played inside your soul
I made you sing along
I will return to find out if the melody was wrong

There's gonna be some confusion
And there's gonna be a day
You'll raise your eyes
And look to the skies
And you'll pray, while I play, while I play

// My Life Has Been A Song //

Sweet simple song
Of different lights and different shades
The sound of life erupts and fades
And all the world must play along
My life has been a song

Here as I sleep
The love I dream will gently creep
Inside my heart I softly keep
The tune that plays too long
My life has been a song

Every sound in my head
Every word that I said
Is like a melody, melody
That no little person like me
Could ever change
Every sound in the street
All the cold and the heat
Is like a symphony, symphony
Which has never before been rearranged

Sweet simple song
Of different lights and different shades
The sound of life erupts and fades
And all the world must play along
My life has been a song

Every sound in my head
Every word that I said
Is like a melody, melody
That no little person like me
Could ever change
Every sound in the street
All the cold and the heat
Is like a symphony, symphony
Which has never before been rearranged

Sweet simple song
Of different lights and different shades
The sound of life erupts and fades
And all the world must play along
My life has been a song

Every sound in my head
Every word that I said
Is like a melody, melody
That no little person like me
Could ever change
Every sound in the street
All the cold and the heat
Is like a symphony, symphony
Which has never before been rearranged

// Come Home Johnny Bridie //

I'm full of pride and my heart feels good
Got news from my family up in the woods
At last I can go back where I belong
Sweated it all out for nine long years
Couldn't believe the voice in my ears
When the man saying, "No hiding, son."

So I left the only folks I had known
I was fifteen then, hardly grown
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud
Couldn't get back and I couldn't go far
Said to myself, "Stay right where you are."
Done found yourself a Ma and Pa
Everybody said the kid's no good

Come home Johnny Bridie come home
Johnny Bridie come home
We're all wrong without you
How did we ever doubt you?
He confessed to the killing
It's his role we had you filling
We didn't really mean to make you sad
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad

I left the only folks I had known
I was fifteen then, hardly grown
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud
Couldn't get back and I couldn't go far
Said to myself, "Stay right where you are."
Done found yourself a Ma and Pa
Everybody said the kid's no good

Come Home Johnny Bridie come home
Johnny Bridie come home
We're all wrong without you
How did we ever doubt you?
He confessed to the killing
It's his role we had you filling
We didn't really mean to make you sad
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad

// Method To My Madness //

I played the game, still it's not worth it
Like a woman in the rain
I close my eyes
I'm on the shelf
I know myself

I've seen the lights of every city
Tried to work out where I am
I close my mind for the day
I know the way

I played the game, still it's not worth it
Like a woman in the rain
So I close my eyes I'm on the shelf
I know myself

There's never ever anybody to rely on
There isn't time to count the shoulders I have cried on
That's just circumstances, I must take my chances
But, baby you don't know what I'm saying
But I guess that's not true, and you know that's true
But there's a method to my madness

I played the game, still it's not worth it
Like a woman in the rain
So I close my eyes for the day
And all the way
