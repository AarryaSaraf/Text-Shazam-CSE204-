Walking up to me expecting walking up to me
Expecting words it happens all the time
Present company excepted present company
Except the worst it happens every night

Ah aaaaah present company
Excluded every time
Ah aaaaaah present company
The best that you can find

Talking like a jerk
Except you are an actual jerk
And living proof that sometimes friends are mean

Present company expect it present company
Just laugh it off it's better than it seems

Ah aaaaaah present company
Excluded in every way
Ah aaaaaah present company
Makes me wanna stay

Killing it with close inspection
Killing it can only make it worse
It sort of makes it breed
Present company accepting
Presently we all expect the worst
Works just like a need

Ah aaaaah present company
Excluded in the night
Ah aaaaah present company
Included in the fight

Ah aaaaaaaah, ah aaaaaaaah, aaaaaah
Ah aaaaaaah

Don't you want me to wake up?
Then give me just a bit of your time
Arguments are made for make-ups
So give it just a little more time

We've got to bring our resources
I wanna play it 'til the time comes
Forget your string of divorces
Just go and throw your little hands up

I miss the way the night comes
With friends who always make it feel good
This basement has a cold glow
Though it's better than a bunch of others

So go and dance yourself clean... ooow
Go and dance yourself clean yeah
You're blowing Marxism to pieces
Their little arguments to pieces

It's your show 
It's your show 
It's your show 
It's your show 


Put your little feet doooooooooooown and haaaaaaaang out

Every night's a different story
It's a thirty car pile-up with you
Everybody's getting younger
It's the end of an era, it's true

And you go
(Stop, stop, stop, stop)

Break me into bigger pieces
So some of me is home with you
Wait until the weekend
And we can make our bad dreams come true

And it's ago yeah, it's ago
And if we wait until the weekend
We can miss the best things to do, oh

Go and dance yourself clean
Go and dance yourself clean
You're throwing marks into pieces
Maybe they're arguments the pieces

Oh

We should try a little harder
In the tedious march of the few
Every day's a different warning
There's a part of me hoping it's true
