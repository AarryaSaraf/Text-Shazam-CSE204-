I don't hold you responsible,
all the time i'm alone,
i don't think, its unreasonable,
so i'll cling all night long

The way you make me feel, you got me so tied up 
The way you make me feel, you got me so tied up 
The way you make me feel, you got me so tied up 
The way you make me feel, you got me so tied up 


Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

Here comes the big ideas again, just like they did before and then,
the morning comes again and its on and on and on and on and ooh 
the morning comes again and its on and on and on and on and ooh 
the morning comes again and its on and on and on and on and ooh 
the morning comes again and its on and on and on and on and ooh
