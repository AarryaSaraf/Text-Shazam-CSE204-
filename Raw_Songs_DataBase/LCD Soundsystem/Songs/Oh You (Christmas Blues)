Oh you
How can I regret?
How can I regret what you do?
You know the blame is on you

You won't leave me alone
Though it's the right thing
How can I forget what you put me through?
Sometimes I can't believe it's true

And now we're through
But you think we're cool
And this is my big difference with you

I think I'm ashamed
The way I feel
I know I'm ashamed
I feel like a shock

I want to forget
I want to forget
I get what I get
These Christmas blues
And that's the truth
But they come in, they come in
