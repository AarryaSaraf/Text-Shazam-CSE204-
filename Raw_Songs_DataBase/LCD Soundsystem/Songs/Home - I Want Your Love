Take me home

Just do it right
Make it perfect and real
Because it's everything
No everything was never the deal

So grab your things and stumble into the night
So we can shut the door on terrible times
No

Yeah, do it right
And head again into space
So you can carry on
And carry on, and fall all over the place

This is the trick, forget a terrible year
And we can shut the door until it gets weird

And this is what you waited for
But under lights, we're all unsure
So tell me
What would make you feel better?

As night has such a local ring
And love and rock are fickle things
And you know it
Yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know

Take

Forget your past
This is your last chance now
And we can break the rules
Like fuck all will last

You might forget
Forget the sound of a voice
Though you should not forget
Yeah, don't forget
All the shit that we laughed about

And after rolling on the floor
And thankfully, a few make sure that you get home
And you stay home
'Cause you better

'Cause you're afraid of what you need
Yeah, you're afraid of what you need
If you weren't
I don't know what we'd talk about

Yeah, no one ever knows what you're talking about
So I guess you're already there
And no one opens up when you scream and shout
So it's time to make a couple things clear

If you're afraid of what you need
If you're afraid of what you need
Look around you, you're surrounded
It won't get any better

And so say goodnight



What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
What am I gonna do, gonna do, gonna do, gonna?
I can't kick this feeling when it hits

Do you feel like you ever want
To try my love and see how well it fits?
Baby, can't you see what you do to me?
I can't kick this feeling when it hits
All alone in my bed at night
I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight
I think of you and I dream of you
All of the time, what am I gonna do?

I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I need your love
I'll share my dreams and make you see
How really bad your love I need
I want your love, I need your love
Just like the birds need sky above
I'll share my dreams and make you see
How really bad your love I need
