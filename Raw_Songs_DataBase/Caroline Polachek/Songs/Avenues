Between the buoy of dreaming
And the anchor of home
I had you
Leaning into the beams
In the fading heat
I showed you yours, you showed me mine

All my avenues are green
No trembling or goodbye
But the shadows know I miss you
Dearly, dearly
So sincerely

Under buoys of dreams
Above an anchor home
I found you
And though you can't call me lover
I'm a star in your sky
Baby, I'm a loner by design

All my avenues are green
As heartache is unwise
Ashes scatter of what happened
Nearly, nearly
So sincerely
