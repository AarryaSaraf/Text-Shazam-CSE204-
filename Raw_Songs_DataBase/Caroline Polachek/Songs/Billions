Psycho, priceless
Good in a crisis
Working the angles, oh, oh
Billions

Sexting, sonnets
Under the tables
Tangled in cables, oh, oh
Billions

Salting, flavour
Lies like a sailor
But he loves like a painter, oh, oh
Billions

Hand it over, broker
Give me the closure
Here's a pearl of the oyster, oh, oh
Billions

Say, say, say, say something to me
Say, say, say, say something to me

Headless, angel
Body upgraded
But it's dead on arrival, oh, oh
(Billions)

Twisted, manic
Cornucopia
Can my cup overflow with, oh, oh
(Billions)

I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you (I never felt so close to you)
(I never felt so close to you)

Psycho, priceless
Good in a crisis
Working the angles, oh, oh
Billions

Hand it over, broker
Give me the closure
Here's a pearl of the oyster, oh, oh
Billions

(Oh, oh) Say, say, say, say something to me
(Oh, oh) Say, say, say, say something to me

Oh, I've never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
