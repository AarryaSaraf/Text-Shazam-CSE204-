Earth went silent
London fell asleep
She dreamed of winter
Where you appeared to me
Perfect timing as new petals in November
A tender creature
A fever
Disarming, fluorescent

There you were
With your mirror
Shining the world all over me
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light

I collected
Stupid ashes
So that after you'd gone
I could hold onto something
But you stayed unwavering
Through every false goodbye
Unsubsiding
Pining
For now and for never

There you were
With your mirror
Shining the world all over me
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light

Oh if only
The umbrella of the sky
Could wrap us up and up
That's where I'd zoom in close
Dilated as your eyes
But til then I'll keep it brief

Faithful inertia
Her bullet doesn't slow
It seeks and finds me
How far it goes
Heaven help me
Take this bag of wings
And drown it in the thames
And wake tomorrow
Hollow
Hardly forgetting

There you were...
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light
