Oh, let them talk while we lie in the grass
It flatters the world even if it won't last
Forgive me if I was too forward too fast
But not being yours would be wasteful

Oh, Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after
Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

Oh, let them talk while you reach for my hand
Replacing a drowning idea of a man
And when we get home with our shoes filled with sand
We'll just sleep and forget that we're strangers

Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after
Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

And when you step out that door
You'll leave me unafraid of change
And I...
And when you step out that door
You'll leave me unafraid of change

Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after
