Draw the blinds
Draw the bath
It's a matter of time
Til you wake up and watch me
Draw your brow
With shaky hand
So that after you're gone
I got something to hold onto

Red light
Oh my faults
Camera one, camera two
Oh my greed
On your side, on the carpet
Oh your need
Camera one, camera two

Angel
I'd hold you down
Forsake me
Here on the ground
All or nothing

Draw your blood
Draw your breath
Skip the whites of your eyes
Til you wake up and watch me
Draw your wings
From your back
I'll not be shy
No, I'll not be gentle with you

Red light
Oh my faults
Camera one, camera two
Oh my greed
On your side, on the carpet
Oh your need
Camera one, camera two

Angel
I'd hold you down
Forsake me
Here on the ground
All or nothing

All or nothing
