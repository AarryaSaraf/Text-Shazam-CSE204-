How I remember, how I forget
Wanted to hate you but love you instead
Violence made me gentle at last
Closer and closer and closer to you
Baby, I'm dying to find you

Ooh, I fly to you (Hey)
After all the tears (Hey)
You're all I need (Hey)
I fly to you (Woo)
Not just somewhere
Deep inside of me (Hey)

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (Hey)
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (Hey)
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (Woo)
Ah-ah

Driving through the dark
Lost but I'm free
I'm looking for something
That nobody else can see (See)
Will you still love me
After the bend? (The bend)
Remember what's gone before
Not loaded with regret (Regret)

Ooh, I fly to you (Hey)
After all the tears (Hey)
You're all I need (Hey)
I fly to you (Woo)
Not just somewhere
Deep inside of me (Hey)

(Hey)
(Hey)
(Woo)

Mmm, I fly to you
After all the tears
You're all I need
I fly to you
Not just somewhere
Deep inside of me (How I remember)
Ooh, I fly to you (How I forget)
After all the tears (Wanted to hate you, but love you instead)
You're all I need (violence made me)
I fly to you (Gentle at last)
Not just somewhere (Closer and closer and closer to you)
Deep inside of me (Baby, I'm dying to find out)

I'm looking for something
Nobody else can see
Remember what's gone before
Not loaded with regret
