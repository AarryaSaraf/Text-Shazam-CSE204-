// Huey //

Foot and hand on the gates
We was jumping, oh fuck, I'm like quicksand in my ways
Was always stuck and I'm stuck until an ambulance came
The first time I changed fast through Los Angeles lanes
And my bitch say the spliff take the soul from me
And the clique tight-knit, it's like the 'lo rugby
Beat the fuckin beat up like it stole from me
You can talk to Clancy you need a feature, or quote from me
I'm off the lancy, I reek of reefer and show money
It's Early running with niggas, who cold running shit
The wins like lotion, he get it he go rub 'em in
Critics pretend to get it and bitches just don't fuck with him
I spent the day drinking and missing my grandmother
Just grab a glass and pour up some cold white wine
And a Colt 45 in it, you know how I get it
I'm toasted myself and a toast to all my niggas
And there ain't no time limit, I'm toasted as hell
And I gotta jot it quick cause I can't focus so well

And now, a formal introduction

// Mantra //

Get your lady
Cop, piff, inhale & cough
Rip the label off this
Picked the road that got twists
I'm holding my dick & playing cautious

Imma show you how it's done right nigga
Drop this when the sunlight gone
Better run right home when the sky turn black
Screaming "fuck five-0" til my line go flat
In that ash-gray beamer we'll be callin that the pigeon coupe
Jack knife bitches to the couches in they living rooms
Ask who the best and I doubt that they picking you
Back like how I need to style, I invented you
Act like you don't know the name
Only time I ain't eating when the cho-cha stanky
Listening to Pre, getting dome while I lane switch
Bitches by the three licking coke off the pinky of a
Poster child, you're supposed to hate me
Bold & wild, you broke and angry, my nigga
Name getting bigger than the difference between us
Niggas is fake, I limit the features I give 'em
Sweat (sweat) shirt (shirt)
You know you famous when the niggas that surround you switch
And if they hating in a passive tense, now they hounding dick
And you ain't ask for this
Now you surrounded with a gaggle of 100 fucking thousand kids
Who you can't get mad at, when they want a pound & a pic
Cause they the reason that the traffic on the browser quick
And they the reason that the paper in your trousers thick
I said sweat (sweat), shirt (shirt)
You can tell the Reaper Imma meet em when he sent for me
With a cleaver, & a .30, and some twisted weed
I pick one, and let the crimson leak, nigga

Get your lady
Cop, piff, inhale & cough
Rip the label off this
Picked the road that got twists
I'm holding my dick & playing cautious

You used to say you like violins
And your lifestyle depend on me
And I know it's night time when you get lonely
And tell all your little friends how that bitch stole me
And despite all the facts that you got phony
You gonna tell them bout the night that you exposed me
For the bastard I was
And how I probably smashed every bitch that I passed in the club
And the last couple months was the worst
Cause I smashed all the trust
That I earned in the past couple months
That we had as a couple
My abscence, a fuss
Was a problem that we ain't ever really get to solve
We just smashed & we scuffled
Tryna keep it calm but I snap at you
Now you're taking all your property back & it's obvious that
That apart from the fact that we fuck & it's bomb
And I hate when you home
And when I'm gone I don't call cause you nag
Man I brought you some shit
And I bought you some shit
What you offering here?
What the fuck you offering here?

// Faucet //

Chef Sweaty braising your faculty
Face getting gray from the ash, but I'm laughing
That's the trace of me nigga
Fuck out my face while I'm thinking
Ain't step foot up in my momma place for a minute
My days numbered
I'm focused heavy on making the most of 'em
I feel like I'm the only one pressin' to grow upwards
It's still fuck you and whoever you showed up with
Just trying to see an end and some steadier hands
Who you callin' your mans
Bet you thought he was solid
When he really just sand
Washing away with the water
I'm a land mammal
Staying away from the altar
Shit changed in the August
In the wake of that August
Last autumn the leaves fell
And I raked in the profit
Disobeying the doctor
The good guy prescribe, faith they never caught 'em
Chasing these rabbits, whole face in the faucet

[x2:]
And I don't know who house to call home lately
I hope my phone break, let it ring
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po
When I run, don't chase me

Solid, so the funds don't phase me
On tour wildin' by the truck stop racists
As hard as finding me a, a common thread between us
Raised different, my momma, she born readily
To get shit poppin' like the gun's off safety
Sayin' easy and doing harder when you get caught up
Raised neck and neck with Nak, so I'm a fluid brawler
Rain checkin' on ya product, never (im)'pressing papa
Out the toaster, I gotta focus on my family problems
Shrunk and widened up with the bumps in my personal finance
It hurt cause I can't keep a date or put personal time in
A reverse of the times when my face didn't surprise you
Before I did the shit that earned me my term on that island
Can't put a smile on your face through your purse or your pocket
Shit in a pile, never change, I'm stupid for tryin'
Still this nigga too busy wildin'

[x2:]
And I don't know who house to call home lately
I hope my phone break, let it ring
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po
When I run, don't chase me

// Grief //

Alright
Uh, uh, uh

Good grief, I been reaping what I sow
Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute
I been living what I wrote
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas
Momma taught me how to read 'em when I look
Miss me at the precinct getting booked
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga

I don't act hard, I'm a hard act to follow, nigga
Like it or not, when it drop, bet he gotta listen
Chasing dragons, tryna make it happen, on a mission
Step into the shadows, we could talk addiction
When it's harmful where you going and the part of you that know it
Don't give a fuck, pardon me for going into details
3-7-6 was a brothel
We had females come in every hour on the dot
And the shit sound like a gavel when it knock
Focus on my chatter, ain't as frantic as my thoughts
Lately I've been panicking a lot
Feeling like I'm stranded in a mob
Scrambling for Xanax out the canister to pop
Never getting out of hand, steady handling my job
Time damaging my ties
Who turn to get up? Get dude turned to dinner quick
You circus niggas, you turning into tricks
I was making waves, you was surfing in 'em
Dealing with the stomach pains just from birthing niggas' shit
Cut the grass off the surface
Pray the lawnmower blade catch the back of a serpent, nigga, shit
Bitch

Good grief, I been reaping what I sow
Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute
I been living what I wrote
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas
Momma taught me how to read 'em when I look
Miss me at the precinct getting booked
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga

I'm fleeting thoughts on a leash
For the moment, high as fuck
I've been alone in my shit for the longest
Snakes sliding in the street
Mama taught me how to not be like the bodies lying in them
Pigs, riding in 'em
I'm a target so it's hard to even eye me in 'em
If he ain't dying for me, then I ain't riding with him
There's no time for that
Making sure my man wallet's straight like a collar
When you iron that
Thinking 'bout my grandmama, find a bottle
I'mma wallow when I lie in that
I just want my time and my mind intact
When they both gone, you can't buy 'em back

// Off Top //

[cough]
Yo I gotta stop smoking backwoods
"How you doing?" And what's your motive, ho?
I only trust these bitches bout as far as I can throw em
Trying to pay my momma rent, figure that's just what I owe her
I been trouble since I tumbled out that stroller
Strollin easy down this narrow path, beefin' with your scary ass
'Preme got my little niggas cheesing off the cherry ad
And nigga that's a great lunch, poppa swamp and stomping with the skate fucks
Heavy handing tracks until the day the fucking train come
Raised up where every mouth that speak the truth get taped shut
Peep the evening news my nigga, we don't do the same stuff
Kiwis couldn't take us, boy im jogging around these bases
Niggas pitches need to change, I separated from my main one
It's just another day, another nigga's bitch to face fuck
I been like this since the Motorola Razr
What a bastard that baby was, little mad nigga missing dad
Never praying much
Right around the same time his grandmama drank a bunch
Take the bus, take a niggas seat like it was made for me
I got this nigga Da$h with me
He sipping on some maple leaf
I'm only happy when there's static in the air cause the fair weather fake to me
Living in the scope, hairs crossed like adjacent streets
Dare a nigga think it's sweet, never, bitches funny boy, 
you berries And you honey for the bear that's here to tear and eat
Run a niggas pockets like some errands make it hasty
Hope the sheriff keep away from me

// Grown Ups //

[Earl Sweatshirt:]
Feel this cage when that acid fade
Face the same but your mind has changed
You desire a stable home
I acquire fame at naming hoes
Contemplating ways of getting dome
Plotting on my neighbors
Asking God for favors
Guess he isn't home
Probably 'cause that fucking faith I didn't show
Skippin church, flip the work
Hit the dirt, like Tommy run it bitch
Grew up in a home that papa wasn't in
Came up off of work that my conscience wasn't in
Either way it goes, a lot is getting hit
And if it wasn't hoes, then it probably was a lick
Got burners on my soul, and my posse on my skin
Sweaty D-A dollar top lotto picks
Promise that I am not the one to fucking plot against
Love him, but my father ain't my mother fucking friend
Trying to figure out how to start a mother fucking end
Trend dodging, keep a bitch by me
Back roll
Garbage bag full of xans
Teach myself to rap and steal nigga
Cash is in hand
Packs get vac sealed
Like the Tin Man
Cardiac Stillness
Cardiac still missing

Don't know where I'm going, don't know where I been
Never trust these hoes, don't even trust my friends
Tell that bitch to roll up, fucking with some grown ups
Don't know where I'm going, don't know where I been
Never trust these hoes, don't even trust my friends
Tell that bitch to roll up, fucking with some grown ups

[Earl Sweatshirt & Da$h:]
My mama wonder why it never seem to reach
See my Daddy in the way I'm acting
And my facial features
Just trying to put you on
Dog I came from teachers
Take the plate and clean it
Nigga I'm a dog
Tell her hit or miss me with the fucking monologue
Lord I can't fight it
Know I'm tryna brawl
Get a copper hauled off
I'm the type of nigga that you cop your raw off
Popping hoes off
Grab the board and these niggas call charge
Chain switches jerseys like it's all star
Press the OnStar
Think it's all lost

// AM // Radio //

[Wiki:]
Nineteen, still gettin' kicked out the crib
Ripped off my bib, spit out my food, hiccup and piss
Urine burnin', I could smell the liquor in this
Cats always tryna' pick up the fist
Duff this dude out
Rappers stoop just to get to your crib
Now it's like who's face? who's warped? too sauced
Distort thoughts, on my corpse on the asphalt
Back when I'd slack more, rock my slacks or my ass
Everytime, I rap I blast-off
Back when I catch Cor', I always had Sports
Dippin' on cops in my track shorts
So tell my mom I had to make it right
I lie every night about the lime-light so I could lie at night
And tell my Pops' I gotta' take advice
Keep my head screwed on tight, abuse these mics
See me, I'm the contusion type
A cat to smack a mic and catch my fuckin' hair when I'm losing height
Ratking, never losing hype, no
It's Ratking and I do it right
Ratking, yeah, I do it nice, woah

[Earl Sweatshirt:]
Bitch, I skated before I rapped, if you take me before your captain
Bet twenty hots on your Daddy
[?], probably cold and passive
Cause' Pops' was the one that got to me
Feeling down like he passed it and when I'm cornered, it's action
I was kinda' out the game, I'ma put the quarter right back in the slot
In 09', we took the 7 to the Dussy 17 to the block
Bitch, if yo' nigga had Supreme, we was the reason he copped it
And nowadays, I'm on the hunt for lyrics to box with
And some pretty bitches that ain't trip if it's a hit and run
I got the gold cause' I don't do the crying bro
She Mario, I'm tryna' keep the whining to a minimum
Piggies come, bet i'm splittin' quicker than I finish rum
Find me some Indica, nuggets on my fingers and my shirt like they was chicken crumbs
The room spinnin', finna' yak if I don't hit the blunt
Got the chin wagon, slim chances of me getting up
After this, mind in the trash next to where my fuckin' passion went
Doc's fanatics, half-a-Xanax when I'm traveling six hours or more
Brick out on the tour, got kicked out of the morgue
Spit cattle manure shit, shit, rally the Horsemen
Tally the corpses

// Inside //

Fresh out the belly of the island
Into the heart of the city
T and them just hit the road
I had Sage and Nak and 'em with me
I thought the fodder was pretty
So I approached her
My first apartment was
Really covered with roaches
Cause niggas was really smoking
Gotta say that as of late
I been busy with business mostly
Got a tape? Catch a wave
Now you in the industry ocean
And missing out on your boat
I been figuring out my own fish
Home gets distant
We working I'm on the road again
Cold and his spirits is
Bursting up out the Trojan, man
Fridge full of spirits
And the crib mirror mirror
Let me hear why the niggas
That's the peers see and hear us
Then mimmick the fucking motions man
Keep the circle closed
Let them niggas front in the cul-de-sacs
Friendly with the chosen
The rest is getting the poker hand
Face-drinking smoker
It help me duck when emotion jab
Fame is the culprit
Who give me drugs without owing cash
Sipping 'til I melt
Never trying me, I'm diving
Falling victim to myself
Middle finger to the help
When it's problems I don't holler
Rather fix 'em by myself
When it's looking like it's quiet for you
This the shit to yell

This the shit right
Keep your chin high up
Cause when she ain't fucking with you
Then her friend might
Let you get up inside yup
Let this shit ride
You don't get it rocking
Like we do on this side nigga

I blow a spliff before the ink dries on the paper
And lately I don't like shit, I been inside on the daily

// DNA //

[Earl:]
Intercepting a fifth of whisky
And neckin it 'til I'm dizzy
I never was defenseless
I never hugged a fence
I pick a side and trust in it
Stomach full of drugs and shit
My niggas on some other cleanse
Sunday binge, Monday
Then another 6 days back to Sunday when it's done again
And the pants better be creased on my corpse
If you need that, run until the street lights off
Back got bigger, got the team strapped on
And you thought it was magic
But that's just the difference
Nigga my team is magicians
We think of the shit that we want then we get it
Look I got hoes in my britches
Big up Dill and Britches, pro part coming soon
Thought you knew this my nigga
It's crackin like french tips
Just checkin and balances
And checks and salaries
Testing my friendships
Cause niggas get sour of this
Rap shit got the best of me
I threw the rest off the balcony
Shoutout Da$H and Retchy
I know yo bitch check for me
So much for chivalry
So long to every bitch tryna get intimate
I'm in my 20s now
Feet aimed at the jaws of the running mouth
Disdained from the loss since a fucking child
Spotlights on me I ain't stopping in my tracks
We taking it all and we running out
Threw shade in the past but you want me now ho
Put your face in your palm when I come around ya
Tell mom I'mma get a gun
If I get too popular
I'm just being honest with it
Tell her:
Stop whining
It ain't no mo problems
I'm the best out of all these niggas
I'm just home when you speaking
Ain't no home for the weekend
No rest for your ass if I know that you're sleeping
I'm here and I'm there
And I'm up and I'm down
And I'm low and I'm peakin
It's cold in the deep end

Bitch nigga, we the train
If you see 'em wave
Ain't no bitch in my DNA
[x2]

[Na'kel:]
Hundred blunts, niggas chains, that's my day to day
Niggas tryna ride my train like they fucking strays
My bro left today, fuck
Hot sauce in my cup of noodles, you taught me that
I ain't seen us in years
And this news right here almost made me have a heart attack
Your momma heart intact
We just spoke, I couldn't stomach that
I'm going to London on the first, I'm bringing you something back
A house on the hill with a big ass grill
We could have a boxing match
Japan, Australia, I know you be proud of that
I got a couple bitches now, I ain't gotta lie about that
I know you in a better place, I can't even cry about that
When I look into the clouds, I know you look down on me
Right next to grandmammy, and the rest of the ones who wanna see me happy

[Vince Staples:]
Soon as I catch the vibe tell 'em to fetch the hearse
Shorty I'm pressin' lines lifting the Lauren shirt
Tell her to bless the girth if she with it
I'm in that kitchen, wrist water whippin'
Sike nigga, I don't do that
Niggas get blue blacked and blown away
Wessons making Mexicans wetbacks like orale
Okay, I'm on to something
Momma should've told you it'd be days like this
It's just a tale from the crip
I'm on my séance shit, I'm tryna' make a million dollars
Keep it hood while crossing over on some A.I. shit
I need a foreign baby momma to match a nigga model whip
Ramona Park made me from scratch
A lot of lotto picks lost in this game called rap
I be the underdog
Bullet hit his forehead, it exit out his under arm
Ain't nobody bigger than my hood, my nigga, fuck a boss
Baby momma killer, you offended and I fuck her raw
Stretchy doin' federal time for bustin' at the law
And he gonna be a neighbor of mine, you played me for a pawn
Shorty I be swimmin' with sharks, your posse full of prawns
Pistols rip his body apart, now he afraid of dark alleyways
Niggas better listen to what the pastor say

[Earl Sweatshirt:]
It's golf on that.. bitch, it's golf on that ball cap
I guzzle the tall boy, Jehovah ain't call back
And ya'll still debating over Earl music
Troops got the group nationwide moving merch units crazy
Peanut butter to paisley, walking down the street
In the different color McGrady's, that first grader was me
Now my fist full of splifs and an old baker receipts
Bitches grip the stick and jerky like cold shanks of the beef, dry
I'm taking purses like they chances in the evening
Pick your pants up, boy, you dancing with a demon
On my momma I been limiting my features
Filling swishers up with reefer
Bitch, it's difficult to beat him like a soft dick
Golf clique deep and we don't hit the streets passive
That nigga Sweaty got the gas and Shreddy k brought the matches
Put your body down in water like a Lipton tea bag is
Switch to different fucking whip to let them piggies speed passed em
It's the rats, try and get the cheese
What it do? Rap like I'm mincing meat
Call me Lou, if I'm on a track niggas skip to me
Niggas want to fade me, bitches feel some type of way for me
50's in my pocket falling out like fucking baby teeth
Vince be with the rocket, he gone pop it when it's danger round
Fingertips to tapers, now, salute us when you face us
Give a fuck about the moves all these loser niggas making now
