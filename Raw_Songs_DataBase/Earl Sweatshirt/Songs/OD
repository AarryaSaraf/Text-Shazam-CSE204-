Give it up, we...

Somebody tooted in the student commence?
The bell rang, he went home to argued in the comments
I watched the doppler move, I watched a child get introduced to violence
I beat you to the point, my noose is golden
Truer living lonesome
Pugilistic moments
Riveting, come get to know me
At my innermost my family been this anguished misanguished now I need atonement
I set the goal, half my wings is broken
I spread the other for my brodie OD
Tiptoeing too much love
My sister showed in a rut
We getting over sinning up
Living in the moment, you been corrupt
Have some gin and rum
Since a jit I figured what's the use in giving up
I can't give enough
Shilajit in my sippy cup
Healing cuts, but really-ly I'm re-filling the pump no concealing it
The Enemy up in arms bearing snubs they just break to see the cup
My memory really leaking blood
It's congealing, stuck
Pieces in slums, one
Peaking in the dust, weaving
I remember woods
I remember in the, when he wasn't remembering much
I remember love healing the ruptures
Feeling rushed, grew up quick
Trip around the sun, this my 25th, give it up
Gin and rum
We wasn't supposed to be alive, no funny shit
