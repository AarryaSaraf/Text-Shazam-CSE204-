(All my life!)
(ini was...)
(Ewwww, mine was a lover of a wrong kind...)
(Keepin what you tell'n me)
(I know mine...)

Living in a lonesome way...
Had me looking other ways
Cause I am, I am, I am, I am lost here, again
But on a brite fall morning Im with it
I Stood a little while within it
Man you have to know
Know the way, it goes

It goes-, it goes-
I am, I am, I am, I am
Go, go
I am, I am, I am, I am

If forgiveness is a chore
What you waiting for
We been here before
And I can't ignore it anymore
You know the way it goes
How much longer then? (I show you in)
(Now I'll tell you why)

I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am

Ain't no say what i do in
Every day say they don't like it
I say hey don't like it
I say hey don't like it
I say hey don't like it
I say hey don't like it

If that ain't just the truth
I am, I am, I am, I am
I like you, I like you!
And that ain't nothing new

And if it don't happen like that
Well then it don't happen at all
Keepin' what you tell me
Now I won't lie, ai ai ai

// We //

For only takers, stand and take in where you are
Turn around and face it: youre adjacent to the scar
I want mine here tho
We heard that story before

What you think we're tamin' with the towers and the oar
You keep evading boy, you putting me flat on the floor
Its ok
You were young when you were gave it
But you stayed there

N you'd expect it when we photograph our scars
Some lonely fable that we took in then right from the start

I want it back
I want it back
Won't you tell me how to get I back
I want it back
I want it back
Why won't you tell me how to get I back

My my my my

Im coming over for another story told
Im saying homie that its not what you been sold
Its hardly what you'd know

The ordinary something neither of us holds
No folding gold for protecting from the lords
Who's that really we leave out in the cold?
But they're depending so you just keep giving pause
I must defend it oh the tariffs hit you hard
Just keep adding up boy youll be below regard

// Holyfields, //

Danger been steppin' in
I'm happy as I've ever been
Couldn't tell you what the cadence is
It's folded in the evidences?
So you wanna leave a mark?
You're honing in on meadowpark
I heard you guys are very safe
Caught up with the featherweights

The dawn is rising
The land ain't rising
NO NO NO
Flash hope
Pass the throw

Comin' in very late
Just above our pay grades
You ask me not to pull alarms
We have to act our ages

The dawn is rising
But the land ain't rising
NO NO NO
Catch up
You wanna go the fast way?

Bonded weights
Don't favor them
If it's all that you don't do
It's lacerate
Better let them pass away

Stay, go?
Better that you find a new way
Before my eyes
Couldn't learn it any other way
By the way

// Hey, Ma //

I waited outside
I took it remote
I wanted a bath
"Tell the story or he goes,
Tell the story or he goes"

Full time you talk your money up
While it's living in a coal mine
Tall time, to call your Ma
Hey Ma, Hey Ma
Tall vote, you know you mope it up
Well you wanted it your whole life
You're back and forth with light

I waited outside
I was toking on dope
I hoped it all won't go in a minute
With the past that you know
I wanted all that mind sugar
I want it all mine
I had a heavy mind, sugar
I took it, it was right

Full time you talk your money up
While it's living in a coal mine
Tall time, to call your Ma
Hey Ma, Hey Ma
Tall vote, you know you mope it up
Well you wanted it your whole life
You're back and forth with light

(Hey Ma, Hey Ma, Hey Ma)

I waited outside
Then you took me in the room
And you offered up the truth
My eyes crawling up the window to the wall
From dusk till dawn
Let me talk to em
Let me talk to em all

Full time you talk your money up
While it's living in a coal mine
Tall time, to call your Ma
Hey Ma, Hey Ma
Tall vote, you know you mope it up
Well you wanted it your whole life
You're back and forth with light

// U (Man Like) //

Mmm, mmm

I will see you off now
Down the back of the ridge
There's just something that I got to show you
There's domer and there's rot
And the common case
It ain't nothing what you say is true

With your long arms, try
And just give some time
Presently, it does include my dues
Ain't your standard premonitions
All this phallic repetition
Boy, you tell yourself a tale or two

Man like you
Man, improve

Well, I know that we set off for a common place
And the lines have run too deep
How much caring is there of some American love
When there's lovers sleeping in your streets?

So Cerberus Ride!
Bring those dead alive
Like Pirate Jenny on the Black Freighter
It'll be a long day of fixing
Make something else yo mission
Boy, this shit's so hard to cue

Man like you
How you do?

// Naeem //

More love
More love

All along em
I can hear me
I go for the caste
I fall off a bass boat
And the concrete's very slow
And the concrete's very slow
All along the sideliness bigger
I'm over the dash
I'm having a bad bad toke
But the berries still to come
All along them I can hear ya

I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying
I can hear cry
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying

All along me I can hear you
I'd occupy that
Can't sit back long while yer forming that
Oh my mind our kids got bigger
But I'm climbing down the bastion now
You take me out to pasture now
Well I won't be angry long
Well I can't be angry long
We burnt up in my bed
Standing on the mattress, Laul
Why can't we just patch this up
And I cannot seem to carry it all
All along we I can hear me

I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying
I can hear cry
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying
I can hear crying
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying
I can hear cry
I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear crying

All around me I can hear em
So what is gonna happen now?
If you don't look away
What's there to pontificate on now
There's someone in my head
Tell them I'll be passing on
Tell them were young mastodons
And it can't be that it's all
And it can't be that it's all
I'm telling you that I do feel ya
It's suddenly paths, mama
It ain't about class, mama
And it won't be very long
Oh it won't be very long

Hey hey
Hey hey

I can hear crying

// Jelmore //

Well angel Morning Sivanna
Well ain't been gone too far
But heading out towards Ponoma
Where you won't be alone

Where there's' is thrift store manager in a poke camadee
And a gas mask on his arm
And one by one by one
We'll all be gone

We'll all be gone by the fall
We'll all be gone by the falling light

Brick layer
With a hat down on his feet
I'll say no more
I won't lead no Calvary

How long?
Will you disregard the heat
Half beat
It's no misnomer though

I've the feeling that I better go
So
I slide right out the door

// Faith //

Shattered in history
Shattered in paint
Oh, and the lengths that I'd
Stay up late
But brought to my space
The wonderful things I've learned to waste

I shoulda known, that I shouldn't hide
To compromise and to covet all what's inside
There is no design, you'll have to decide
If you'll come to know if I'm the faithful kind

Time and again 
(Got all that I need)
Time to be brave
Content to the phrases
That at dawn we ain't mazes
Just some kind of pages

This for my sister, that for my maple
It's not knowing the road I'd known as a child of God
Nor to become stable
(So what if I lose, I'm satisfied)
Am I dependent in what I'm defending
And do we get to know what faith provides
Fold your hands into mine
I did my believing
Seeing every time

I know it's lonely in the dark
And this year's a visitor
And we have to know that faith declines
I'm not all out of mine

// Marion //

Well I thought that this was half a love
Well I thought that this was half a love
Follow to the rising sea
Well I thought that this was half a love

Well I thought that this was half a love
Well I thought that this was half a love
Follow to the rising sea
Well I thought that this was half a love

// Salem //

Salem burns the leaves
Then she
Returns to cure and see
Heavy fate
After years of waiting

Cause abnormalities
Surely
Are everywhere you see
So what I think we need
Is elasticity, empowerment, and ease

So I won't lead no lie
With our hearts the only matter why
How long it's lasted
I've not received reciprocity

To speak supportively
Big guy
There's no automatic peace
But I bet you'd keep
All these in-betweens that bar my youth

There's no anorberic dream
Fars I know
I tried too hard to see
What I thought it'd be
Asking constantly
How's it gonna be?

So I'm gonna weep a while
You don't even know how hard
I learned a lesson
Don't ask me I've
Torn the banner from the line

// Sh'Diah //

Well you find the time
Don't you
For the Lord
But you can find the time
Oh can't pass it around?

Fever last too long
Fever's rashing on
There's no fountain in silver
How art?
How art?

How often ya gonna see now
Truly what ya cease to be
Will you adjust your scenery
Well you find the time
Don't you
For the Lord

Keep it rational
Keep it rational
There's no fountain

// RABi //

(If you wait it won't be undone)

Well it's all just scared of dying
But isn't this a beach?
And if I know one thing at all
Is I cannot just be a peach
Oh, you come in all woke now
So, please enjoy the feast
We are weightless like a wayless beast
So what is it we don't teach?!

When we were children, we were hell bent
Or oblivious at least
But now it comes to mind
We are terrified
So we run and hide
For a verified little peace

So what of this release?
Sun light feels good now, don't it?
I don't have a leaving plan
But something's gotta ease your mind
But it's all fine or it's all crime any way

There were 6 of us sitting creek side
Sifting fistfuls through the green
Every which way could be seen
Was the sand and time
Not a pantomime
More like anodyne
Was a friend of mine
You don't know, you don't know

I could prophet
I could rob, bye bye, however
Everywhere isn't everywhere
This not a veil
Or a fairytale in the least

So what of this release?
Some life feels good now, don't it?
Don't have to have a leaving plan
Nothing's gonna ease your mind
Well it's all fine and we're all fine any way

(But if you wait it won't be undone)
