Well, you're up all night
And your head's down low
If you can see your own kite
(Shed a little light on it, no?)
Ya know a burden ain't a bust
You are the only way to trust ya
It's only fair it burns up in that rust

Lay down, Martha
Lay down the holy banner flag
Hold out, Martha
Help is surely on it's way
And it's not right
Don't bask in the glory of mine
But, oh no, they can't come 
Take that part away

They ate up all their cake
And they drank their own wine
They were always on the take
They could shed a little light

Well, you no the burden ain't a gust
The only path to love is touch
I'll always know 
That all that proper mounts too much

Lay down, Martha
Lay all that alabaster down
There's no master, help will surely come around
I don't ask
I don't bask in the glory, oh no, nah
And it's up to me if I don't wear a mask

Well you're up all night
And your neighbors don't know
Man, your neighbors don't know
So shed a little light
You know a burden ain't a bust
You know that truth's been known to crutch
No, no, no only them who's pauper lays him up

// Brackett, Wi //

An easy swing had its time shouldered
Slow bending axe
Now it's a photo framed
The swing hasn't had it

And here we are rebuilding roads
Right by roosting towns
It's just like the love
The one that's never been enough

So I'm counting on your fingers
'Cause you've reattached the twitch
And if you want opinion
I will die along the ditches

And every summer is a hot token
To the cold, cold take of lust
And every autumn singes
With the business of sadness

Friend had it wrong they see
Honey let it burn
And the curve in the county
Is never served

So I'm counting on your fingers
'Cause you've reattached the twitch
And if you want opinion
I will die along the ditches

// Do You Need Power? (Walk Out Music) //

Talk back, talk back with 'em
With your full rebound
I ain't nothing with such cautious tale
Suppose I don't roll back now
It all ain't nothin', if you don't survive
Do I need power?
Do you need power?

// Ever New //

Welcome the spring, the summer rain
Softly turned to sing again
Welcome the bud, the summer blooming flower
Welcome the child whose hand I hold
Welcome to you both young and old
We are ever new, we are ever new

Welcome the spring, the summer rain
Softly turned to sing again
Welcome the bud, the summer blooming flower
Welcome the child whose hand I hold
Welcome to you both young and old
We are ever new, we are ever new

Welcome the spring, the summer rain
Softly turned to sing again
Welcome the bud, the summer blooming flower
Welcome the child whose hand I hold
Welcome to you both young and old
We are ever new, we are ever new

// Haven, Mass //

Cobbled to your trail
Bevel through the speech
In the harbors I was hanging on
Cradled wrought and weak
Hardly aching for your drum
I'll be able when you're air born

Peddle all the marble
Tell them all be missing me
Fought from the mainstay
Unhung from a halter
I am back from Baltic now
It's been raining
Now I'm having
You are haven, dear

Pond in north face eyes
Center's sable
Just like cinders in a prairie fire

Pave in the broad
Charring up the tall trees mawed'em
Well, it's maple for their deputy

Got another novel
And I'd wash it down ravines
You're my main in
How that you have altered
Sure is to some fine degree
It's not careening
I am having
You
Are haven, dear...

// Heavenly Father //

Ever since I heard the howling wind
I didn't need to go where a bible went
But then you know your gifts seemed heaven-sent
Just lead me to a choler, dad, that's the thing

And I don't know how you house the sin
(But you're free now)
I was never sure how much of you I could let in
(And I'm free now)
Won't you settle down, baby, here your love has been
Heavenly father, it's definitely lava
Why you don't carry other names?

Heard about a day where it dropped the know
To go another day as we learn to close
'Cause I'm a known coward in a coward wind
(But you're free now)
You turn around now and you count to ten
(To see you go now)
Well, I know now, honey, that I can't pretend
Heavenly father, is who's brought to his autumn
And love is left in the end

'Cause I've just been up here for goddamn years
(Can you see now?)
Filling up hulls with goddamn fears
(I am free now)
I know about it darling, I've been standing here
Heavenly father, is all that he offers
A safety in the end

// I Can't Make You Love Me //

Turn down the lights,
Turn down the bed,
Turn down these voices,
Inside my head

Lay down with me,
Tell me no lies,
Just hold me close,
Don't patronize me [x2]

Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't,
You can't make your heart feel
Something it won't,
Here in the dark,
These final hours
I will lay down my heart
And I feel the power
But you don't,
No you don't

Cause I can't make you love me,
If you don't [x2]

No, you won't

I'll close my eyes,
No, I won't see
The love you don't feel,
When you're holding me
Morning will come,
And I'll do what's right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight
And I will give up this fight...

Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
I can't make your heart feel,
Something it won't,
Here in the dark
These final hours
I will lay down my heart
And I feel the power
But you don't,
No you don't

I can't make you love me if you don't
If you don't,
No you, no you won't

I found love darlin' [x5]
Love in the nick of time
I found love darlin' yeah,
Love in the nick of time

// PDLIF //

Please don't live in fear
We can't see from here right now
Send it off from here
And free your mind

You know it never stays the same
And they will never tell you you're all to blame

So you wanted it rearranged
(Fantastic)
And you wish it was only a shame
(At this stage)
(All we can say)
All there is really to say
Is
We are at the beginning again
But oh
How things can change
(So don't you)
(So don't you)
(So don't you)
So don't you run away!
(Think we on the wrong track somehow)
While I'm not gonna tell you that everyone's safe
I will say
There will be a better day
There will be a better day
There will be a better day

I'd be good to fall back
Think we on the wrong track somehow
I'd be good to fall back
Think we on the wrong track somehow

There's several ways to know better
Papa was a go getter

You know it never stays the same
And they will never tell you you're all to blame

Please don't live in fear

// Roslyn //

Up with your turret
Aren't we just terrified?
Shale, screen your worry from what you won't ever find

Don't let it fool you
Don't let it fool you down
Dancing around, folds in the gown

Sea and the rock below
Cocked to the undertow

Bones blood and teeth erode
With every crashing node

Wings wouldn't help you
Wings wouldn't help you down
Down towards the ground, gravity smiled

You barely are blinking
Wagging your face around
When'd this just become a mortal home?

Won't, won't, won't, won't, won't let you talk me
Won't let you talk me down
Will pull it taut, nothing let out

// Second Nature //

Is this our first? Or second nature?
When's that rapture... will there be merch?
Where is mother â€” she was a stunner, can we page her?
What mine eyes have seen could really take the purse...
Are we charged now? Or are we fakers?
Parade around or get in work? Or just desert...

We will see you next time
They'll be water in the rain
Territories pay fines
All long day (Say it will be! Say it will be!)
All may not be just fine! (All long day!)
There is another fate, a way
To not be too late: Un obfuscate

Is this our fault? And are we just too damn used to it...
The cipher too elusive that tale it just won't stop
You could be vaguely on top, strike the key, lay down the mop
As if endings ain't endings and feet they just won't drop
Ain't this real time? And aren't we takers?
You want what's more and don't excuse...
And just refuse...

We will see you next time (Is this mercy?)
They'll be water in the rain
Territories pay fines
All long day (Say it with me! Say it with me!)
All may not be just fine! (All long day!)
There is another fate, a way
To not be too late...

We will see you next time
They'll be water in the rain
Territories pay fines
All long day (Say it with me! Say it with me!)
All may not be just fine! (All long day!)
There is another fate, a way
To not be too late: Un obfuscate

// So Unimportant //

Don't look down
Hold up your head now
Hang on to your honor
Don't know why I've compromised you the most

You pull it closer
Don't make it hard now
If I remember one thing
It's that I don't surprise you at all
Anymore

Is there something that you want to say to me?
Is there somewhere that you want to escape to?
I'll cling like a waterfall
While I don't recognize you at all
Anymore

You watch me burn out like a rocket
I catch you mumbling it time after time
I just want all of it to stop your crying
I'll take the bribe now
It's so unimportant what started the fight

All eyes ahead
It's sadder at the end
I drink till I'm falling down
And I'm hanging on by a thread

Is there something that you want to say to me?
Is there somewhere that you want to escape to?
I'll cling like a waterfall
While I don't recognize you at all
Anymore

You watch me burn out like a rocket
I catch you mumbling it time after time
I just want all of it to stop your crying
I'll take the bribe now
It's so unimportant what started the fight
