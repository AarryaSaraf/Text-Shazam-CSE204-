Well, you're up all night
And your head's down low
If you can see your own kite
(Shed a little light on it, no?)
Ya know a burden ain't a bust
You are the only way to trust ya
It's only fair it burns up in that rust

Lay down, Martha
Lay down the holy banner flag
Hold out, Martha
Help is surely on it's way
And it's not right
Don't bask in the glory of mine
But, oh no, they can't come 
Take that part away

They ate up all their cake
And they drank their own wine
They were always on the take
They could shed a little light

Well, you no the burden ain't a gust
The only path to love is touch
I'll always know 
That all that proper mounts too much

Lay down, Martha
Lay all that alabaster down
There's no master, help will surely come around
I don't ask
I don't bask in the glory, oh no, nah
And it's up to me if I don't wear a mask

Well you're up all night
And your neighbors don't know
Man, your neighbors don't know
So shed a little light
You know a burden ain't a bust
You know that truth's been known to crutch
No, no, no only them who's pauper lays him up
