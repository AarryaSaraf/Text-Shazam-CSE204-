"So apropos
Saw death on a sunny snow"


"For every life..."


"Forgo the parable"


"Seek the light"


"...my knees are cold"

Running home
Running home
Running home
Running home


"Go find another lover
To bring a- to string along!"

"With all your lies
You're still very lovable"

"I toured the light
So many foreign roads
For Emma, forever ago"
