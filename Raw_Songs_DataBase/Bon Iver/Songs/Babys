Summer comes to multiply, to multiply
Summer comes to multiply, to multiply

And I, I'm the carnival of peace
I'll probably start a fleet with no apologies
And the carnival of scenes, it grows more and more appealing
But my woman and I, my woman and I know what we're for

Summer comes to multiply, to multiply
Summer comes to multiply, to multiply
