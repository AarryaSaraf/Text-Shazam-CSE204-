Don't even ask, stupid ass, am I famous

[Ice Cube]
(Are you famous?) My resume is heaven's way
of tellin y'all that God will make a way
I rock a motherfuckin mic 'til the break of day
Darrell Dawkins flow, y'all need to make a breakaway
Microphone fiend with that guillotine killer team
You motherfuckers won't amount to a hill of beans
When I ride by, well over 35
Y'all still run and hide, scared of a driveby

[Chorus 2]
I ain't ghetto, don't you know, I'm urbanian

Won'tcha Google me bitch, try to Google me this

[Ice Cube]
I'm urban, and ordained
Your little ass is kind of churban, and propane
Your little flame is like a flicker
And my bang, is off the motherfuckin Richter
I'm hard liquor
Cirrohsis of the liver
Black lung is what I deliver
That's what you get, if you ever try to smoke the nigga
Don't provoke a nigga, I'm from that urban community
Lookin for some unity, fuckin you and me
I only bang shit true to me
With iced out jewelry, what can they do to me?
Nothin, I only bang shit true to me
With iced out jewelry, what can they do to me?

[Chorus 2]

// Too West Coast //

[Ice Cube]
My ego, is big as Heathrow
Yup this a lethal, easy as a free throw
Yes this negro, is rather lethal
You about as lethal, as a mojito
Be my amigo, eat my burrito
You a fuckin seagull, up in Francisco
I'm up in a Regal, still in my pea coat
Murder's what she wrote, this is mo' evil
This is less than zero, don't be a hero
Nigga I'm a pharaoh, with double barrels
Goose bumps, hair rose, when I shoot these arrows
at your Camaro, pullin down Melrose
Still down with Elkos{?} 'til the fuckin cell close
Nigga don't test me, you're gonna fail those
They should arrest me, blow like Dizzy Gillespie
I don't aim where yo' vest be (bang)

[W.C.]
I'm too hot, to stop, walkin up with two Glocks
Way more than two shots, that'll make your roof drop
House shoes, blue top, money like I move rocks
Dissin will get you socked, and yo' bitch move wop
Whole crew popped, by this old school new shot
G niggaz still keep my weed in a shoebox
Dippin rollin through blocks, dippin while the crew pops
Eatin chicken dinners in my cutoffs and tube socks
Play my shit a lot of deejays they do not
Cause me and bitch niggaz don't mix like two cocks
Who knocks with them pocket rockets that'll shoot dots
Have your skull on the news lookin like goulash
When they ask who the top don't mention us as foolish
Eat yo' ass up like a pack of barracudas
Put the barrel to ya, like we never knew ya
Send the metal through ya, Da Lench Mob shooters

[Maylay]
I know vatos and they get popped most
Niggaz that flip mo' chicken than Bosco's
Squattin down the block low, hop in that hot fo'
And I can spot Poles when they not in cop clothes
Squabble with the combos, Maylay got those
Crates or case, boxloads like they came from Costco's
They be poppin bottles, we knockin hollows
Promise by tomorrow I can have the spot closed
Talkin pronto, somethin like a lotto
Chips and cheese fuck meat, nigga these nachos
Speakin on guap' though, cause that's a combo
Keep my green on the side like it was cilantro
Comin with the honchos, that's in a stock Rolls
And everythang up out they mouth is like the gospel
It won't stop flow oh I'm not though
Lench Mob, big swanger, don't bang is the motto

[Chorus 4X: all]
Motherfuckers tell me - I'm too West coast
They act like they scared of me - I'm too West coast

[Outro: Keith David (W.C.)]
The Grand Wizard
Ice Cube
[laughing]
(I am the West, Cube!)

[Ice Cube:]
West! - I rep that dub! - I rep that S! - "I'm a monster!"
WestSide, Lochness, I'm a problem!
Matter fact I'm a mess, Los Angeles so scandalous
South Central - home of so much potential!
But if you go there the warfare is mental
Bring your wheelchair - you probably gon' need it!
Leave this motherfucker - a paraplegic
Niggas around the world that think they wanna bang,
Don't get your ass caught up like Lil' Wayne!
I'm too WestCoast for the WestCoast
Too Fresno to suritos - Too soul food and burritos!
I'm down with Angelinos!
Go downtown - and give a bum a C-note!
This my town! - I run it! - You walk it!
You just now learnin' the game - I taught it!

[Chorus: Jigg sings (Ice Cube)]
Doin' my own, own thang, thang;
And if you got a problem with' that,
Then the Nina go bang, bang! (bang!) Bang, bang! (bang!)
And I be everywhere on the map!

All you WestCoast DJ's check your wrists
If you skiddad the big fish to your playlist!
Now - enemies of this industry, I'm a
Hall of famer! - Treated like a stranger!
Fuck that! Another WestCoast banger!
Who gives a fuck if they play it in Virginia? !
I'm a play it on Denker! - Play it Western
All of Van Ness will make your head turn!
Motherfuckers wanna take our style
And run that shit - 3000 miles;
Then - rub your shit all in our face
This - a war show all at our place;
Damn! - Can a nigga get a lil ol' taste
Of some of that shine - it look like mine?

[Chorus: Jigg sings (Ice Cube)]
Doin' my own, own thang, thang; (damn!)
And if you got a problem with' that,
Then the Nina go bang, bang! (bang!) Bang, bang! (bang!)

Let me tell you what's real and what's fake
Look don't let me hurt your feelings

Kings of this shit, let it be known
Shit real niggas do real things, niggas better recognize
That's OG shit, old school
West side rollin.

// It Is What It Is //

[Intro]
Will I ever get it right? Get it right? [2X]
My momma think I'm outta sight, outta sight [2X]
It is what it is, it is, it is [2X]
I do this for my kids, my kids, my kids [2X]
(Understand me!)
Now homey do you dig, do you dig, do you dig?
It is what it is, it is, is is
I do this for my kids, my kids, my kids [2X]

Now will I ever get it right? Get it right?
Even though I'm out at night, livin life
Girl I'm tryin to make this money, I ain't even playin
Course the game I'm in, it ain't even payin
When I'm on the go, on the go
Everybody wanna know, wanna know
Cube where the fuck you goin, each and every day?
I just turn around, and I say

[Chorus]
It is what it is, it is, it is [2X]
I do this for my kids, my kids, my kids [2X]
Now homey do you dig, do you dig, do you dig?
It is what it is, it is, is is
I do this for my kids, my kids, my kids [2X]

Even though I'm messin up, messin up (you fuckin up)
Feel the devil catchin up, catchin up
I put it in the Lord's hands, he is the man
Please his demands 'fore he turn me into sand (don't do it)
But got to pay the rent, pay the rent
Without the government, government
I do it for the fuck of it, fuck of it [2X]

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Got to get my swagger up [2X]
Please get yo' swagger up
Got to get my swagger up
Better get my swagger up

[Outro]
Check this out homey
This business right here, is personal
I would go around you, over you, under you or THROUGH you
to make sure none of my family suffer
Do you understand me?!

[Chorus]

// Hood Robbin' //

[Ice Cube]
(If I can sell you the American Dream, I can sell you anything...)

[Verse 1]
I got to get out, I'm gettin put out of my house
I got to pack up my refrigerator and couch
It's a set up, but the bank wants me out
Or the L.A.P.D. will smoke me out
This "adjustable rate"- it choked me out
They gave me a loan and I had no clout
They gave me a house, for me and my spouse
Called my mama and my aunt, y'all should re-finance
I let 'em dance wit' the devil
Dig they own grave, and I gave them the shovel
FUCK, my daddy built that house
And when he got drunk, he almost killed that house
Is this American dream, or the American scheme...?
...That got me walkin these American streets?
It's kinda sad when you have to get a hernia
Because ya helped ya grandmama move furniture

(If I can sell you the American Dream, I can sell you anything...)

[Verse 2]
Look at this maggot... with his stimulus package
I can give a fuck about a Dow Jones average
What the fuck you do when your pay check is average?
Law abiding citizen, turned into a savage
Got to feed the children, got to feed the habit
Fell into a rabbit hole, chasin that rabbit
Now I'm in Wonderland, feelin like the Son of Sam
I'm at'cho West coast branch, GUN IN HAND
I'ma feel like Superman...
Walk by the teller, better call a trooper ma'am (Wahh)
It's the revenge of the lambs
Big bad wolf, we sick of these scams
Sick of these plans, sick of this dance
Walked into his office, took the nine out my pants (Wahh)
You not a man, you a (serpent)
Then I prayed to God, let the nine get to workin
(I better get to workin)

[Hook]
You know, I heard they hood robbin
Your money or your life, and it ain't no stoppin 'em
(I better get to workin)
You know, I heard they hood robbin
Your money or your life, and it ain't no stoppin 'em
Ain't that a bitch?
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich?
Ain't that a bitch?
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich?

[Verse 3]
Drug dealer M.D.
Doctor Feel Good, give you what'chu need
In California, prescribe that weed, Oxy Contin, and Codeine
Turn ya grandmama into a fiend
And see this Cyanide? The first hit ain't free
I know you're bout to die, but let me see your ID
I know you're bout to lie, but can ya pay this fee?
If you can't pay, then please have a seat
You can't see a doctor, but you can see a priest
We can't save ya life 'til we got some insurance
Your premium is paid, at that assurance
I hope ya got endurance
They got me on hold, and I'm under the influence
Nurse high as a kite, in charge with my life
And everything is lost, without Blue-Cross

[Hook]
You know, I heard they hood robbin
Your money or your life, and it ain't no stoppin 'em
You know, I heard they hood robbin
Your money or your life, and it ain't no stoppin 'em
Ain't that a bitch?
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich?
Ain't that a bitch?
When you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich?

[Outro]
Whatever you need, we got it for cheap right here baby
This America, it ain't gon' cost ya nothin...
But a arm and a leg... maybe one of them motherfuckin ears, haha
Don't trip, just put in on ya credit card...
Put it in ya baby' name, haha

// Your Money Or Your Life //

This world so trife

Money or your life (give it up)
This world so trife (so trife)
Your money or your life (West Coast)
Yeah, keep your kids, keep your wife
Money or your life

[verse 1:]
I got that gangbang mentality movie after movie
I can't get it outta me, who wanna battle me?
Mouths a Uzi thumbtack your ass to the concrete
Treat you like a fuzi
This pyroclastic flow that I lay
Will turn this fucking boof into pompai
Now what will I do in broad day
Turn Broadway into a hallway
Motherfuckers wanna know the hurbs and spices
They come to me and wanna know what my advice is
I'm spiritual nigga like Jesus Christ is
And lyrical bitch I'm about the nicest
I'm content long jibbily
Plus I spit shit that sit on your brain heavily
I could do this shit 'til I'm 70
On the Vegas strip yeah that's where I be

This world (this world) so trife (so trife)
Your money or your life
Keep your kids, keep your wife
Money or your life (give it up)
This world, so trife (so trife)

Yea keep your kids, keep your wife
Money or your life

[verse 2:]
Now I get that money, make that cheddar
Play a double header, we can do better
You can get wetter, blown out your sweater
So much game need dick buy better
Now Helen and Kellar can read this letter
23 word if you read out for better
I'm a go getter you's a point setter
Pointing at me like you got a vendetta
Boy, you know better
They used to call me cube the impaler
Ask Jerry Heller
You the kind of fella that look for Cinderella
I'm the kind of fella that steal her umbrella
Now this ain't a diss, so don't tell Rockafella
And don't try to exorcise the ghost of Makivella
But I just got to be the best storyteller
A tough Slick Rick win with the soccerfella

This world (ask trella) so trife
Your money or your life (grand wizard)
Keep your kids, keep your wife
Money or your life
This world so trife (so trife)
Your money or your life (gotta have it)
Yea keep your kids, keep your wife
Money or your life

[Verse 1:]
When They Come To LA They Got The Wrong Impression
When They Come To LA They Gotta Learn They Lesson
When They Come To Westcoast It's Such An Obsession

You Don't Go Hollywood When You're From Hollywood

And Even D. Wade And Chris Bosh Know That

The Angels Are Lost They Don't Wanna Be Found
If God Is Looking For Them I Can Show Him Around

// Fat Cat //

[Chorus 1]
Countin money, eatin rats, gettin pussy all day
All I do is lean back, still makin greenbacks

[Chorus 1 (4X) for the first 30 seconds]

[Chorus 2: repeat "That's all I do!" 4X over]
All I do is lean back, still makin greenbacks
Still makin green, still still makin greenbacks
All I do is lean back, still makin greenbacks
Haters get mad cause I'm still makin greenbacks

I'm a fat cat, look at me, stomach like a Volkswagen
Still I can handle my, business got these hoes braggin
Ice Cube put it down (bitch I am the dragon)
I am a fuckin clown (yo look how I'm actin)
They wanna throw me out - but they bet' not touch me
Is this nigga fuckin crazy, or is he just lucky?
Actin like he own the place, y'all niggaz best to rendezvous
This nigga ain't no pussy y'all, this kind of cat all he came to do is

[Chorus 1 (2X) + Chorus 2]

People wanna know how I make that money
Momma Ice Cube didn't raise no dummy
This fat cat don't chase no mice
Hoodrats think they can live off Ice
Enemies think I'm finicky, nigga be
walkin 'round here like a Kennedy
Tend to be, movin like a centipede
Y'all muh'fuckers still just Little League
Now I know when the haters get mad, I'm doin my job
Some niggaz can't dunk 'til you throw them a lob
Better go find, another one to rob
You just a role player this my squad
You get Lenched, this my Mob
Ain't that I, you a facade
All in the alley, lookin through the trash
I'm a fat cat, lookin through the glass

[Chorus 1 (2X) + Chorus 2]

// Man Vs Machine //

[Intro:]
Yo, we in a fight for our lives
we in a fight for our lives
and the trick thing about it
i don't know if we can win
and what's sad? i don't thing we WANNA win

[Verse 1:]
can you help me? a nigga need a job
i'm desperate, for some corn on the cob
i'm helpless, will i have to steal and rob?
no black? dinner so i got to ask bob
bob got a job but it's done by a robot
no lunch breaks so it could do a whole lot
more than a human being and it's European,
ran by a Korean, American,
so there I am, surrounded by aluminum
there's no way you can run,
there's no way you can be,
it's just and me, versus modern day machinery

[Chorus x2:]
it's man vs machine baby
my head's in the guillotine baby
it might take it off clean baby
automated dreams it was man vs machine baby

[Verse 2:]
I'm a fly caught in the web
a fish stuck in the internet
don't they know i'm a deathly catch?
eat this meat, every bite so full of stress
so what can I say to you?
i'm highly relatable and biodegradable
i thought we was unfadeable
slaves to machinery, is that the way to go?
i don't need you to fuck 24/7
i guess that computer love
i don't need you to love
human contact ain't what it used to was

[Chorus x2:]
it's man vs machine baby
my head's in the guillotine baby
it might take it off clean baby
automated dreams it was man vs machine baby

[Outro x2:]
the whole world is automated
it need to be investigated
when people are eliminated
what we supposed to do when its time to feed all the babies?

// Pros Vs Joes //

[Chorus]
Ice Cube boombayay, (yeah!) boombayay
Ice Cube boombayay, (get up!) boombayay
Ice Cube boombayay, (ah ah!) boombayay
Ice Cube boombayay, (get up!) boombayay

[Ice Cube]
what's up baller, I'm an owner now
You niggas ball for me, I be kickin' it up in my suite
Lookin' down ain't none of y'all fuckin with me
I'm like a bully that you mothafuckas hating to see
Better whisper my name, like The Wizard of OZ
If you say it three times, a lyrical barrage
This is not a mirage, there's no way to dodge
This Cobair engine, met before it collaged
I'm swearin to god, this worse than Jihad
Fuckin with Cube, is like the Book of Eli
I'm pullin my blade, I'm slicin you bastards
You local mothafuckas, I rap to the masses
You internet bitches, My pen is so vicious
The genies' out the bottle, and grantin no wishes
Before you attack, ya should've asked Mack
He would've told ya I'm the architect of Gangsta Rap

[Chorus]
Ice Cube boombayay, (yeah!) boombayay
Ice Cube boombayay, (get up!) boombayay
Ice Cube boombayay, (blah!) boombayay
Ice Cube boombayay, (get up!) boombayay

[Ice Cube]
You mothafuckas in the D-League, I'm in the G-League
I got the most money, I smoke the best weed
I got the best kids, And the best life
With a fine wife, Nigga I'm in paradise
Amateurs think it's easy, but you and that bitch 
Ain't about to be the next george and weezy, Just pay to see me 
I'm a pro with a show that's incredible, You better let it go
Better learn how to do the dougie
Before I rap you in a snuggy and push you in the buggy
This is Ice Cube, know the people love me 
On some Spiritual shit, like the man above me (Cmon')

[Chorus x2]
Ice Cube boombayay, (yeah!) boombayay
Ice Cube boombayay, (get up!) boombayay
Ice Cube boombayay, (ah ah!) boombayay
Ice Cube boombayay, (get up!) boombayay
