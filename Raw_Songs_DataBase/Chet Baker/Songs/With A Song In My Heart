With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells
You're touching my hand
It tells me you're standing near, and...

At the sound of your voice
Heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice
That a song such as ours came to be?
And I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you
