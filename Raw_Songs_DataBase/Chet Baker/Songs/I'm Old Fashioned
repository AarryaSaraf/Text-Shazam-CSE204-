I'm old fashioned
I love the moonlight
I love the old fashioned things
The sound of rain
Upon my window pane
The starry song that April sings

This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs
Holding hands
These, my heart understands

I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned with me

This year's fancies
Are passing fancies
But sighing sighs
Holding hands
These, my heart understands

I'm old fashioned
But I don't mind it
That's how I want to be
As long as you agree
To stay old fashioned
With me
