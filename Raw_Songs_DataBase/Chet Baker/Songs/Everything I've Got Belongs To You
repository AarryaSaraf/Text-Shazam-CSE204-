I got eyes for you to give you dirty looks
I have words that do not come from children's books
There's a trick with a knife I'm learning to do
And everything I've got belongs to you

I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist
There are hammerlock holds I've mastered a few
And everything I've got belongs to you

Share for share, share alike
You get struck each time I strike
You for me, me for me
I'll give you plenty of nothing

I'm not yours for better but for worse
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two
And everything I've got belongs to you

Share for share, share alike
You get struck each time I strike
You for me, me for me
I'll give you plenty of nothing

I'm not yours for better but for worse
And I've learned to give the well-known witches' curse
I've a terrible tongue, a temper for two
And everything I've got
Everything I've got
Everything I've got belongs to you
