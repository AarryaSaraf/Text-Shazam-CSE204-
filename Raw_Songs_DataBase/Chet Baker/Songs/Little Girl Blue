Sit there and count your fingers
What can you do?
Old girl, you're through
Sit there and count your little fingers
Unlucky little girl blue

Sit there and count the raindrops
Falling on you
It's time you knew
All you can count on is the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

No use, old girl, you might as well surrender
Your hopes is getting slender
Why won't somebody send a tender
Blue boy to cheer up little girl blue

When I were very young, the world was younger than I
As merry as a carousel
The circus tent was strung with ever star in the sky
Above the ring I loved so well
Now the young world has grown old
Gone are the silver and gold

Sit there and count the raindrops
Falling on you
It's time you knew
All you can count on is the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue
