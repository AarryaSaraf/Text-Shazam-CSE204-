Love is quite the joker
He likes to have his fun
Set you down in clover
'Til he wins you over

Then suddenly leaves you flat
Just like that
Here's your hat
Start walkin'

It isn't easy
The way love plays his game
You can think you're winning
'Til the final inning

But if there's a change of heart
On his part
Might as well
Start walkin'

When things are moving
Then love's a happy child
But if nothing's doing
You got troubles brewing

As soon as his interest lacks
Hit some snags
Pack your bags
Start walkin'

Cause love's a joker
Who likes to have his fun
Set you down in clover
'Til he wins you over

Then suddenly leaves you flat
Just like that
Here's your hat
Start walkin'
