Drive on
Until I get there
I think I'll drive on
Until I get there

'Cause I'm a ram, yes, I am
And I know what to do
I think I'll drive on
Tryin' to get next to you

I'm a ram, baby
You bet your life, I do
I'm a ram now
I wanna get next to you

Drive on
Until I get there
I think I'll drive on
Until I get there

'Cause I'm a ram, yes, I am
And I'm stubborn as I can be
I'm a ram, yes I am
Now try to get next to me

I'm a ram, yeah
You bet your life I do
I'm a ram now
I wanna get next to you

Drive on
Until I get there
I think I'll drive on
Until I get there

'Cause as a ram out in the bush
And he needs to be free
Won't somebody please
Come and see about me

I'm a ram now
You bet your life I do
'Cause I'm a ram now
I wanna get next to you
