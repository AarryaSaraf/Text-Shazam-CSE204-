Lately things are on my mind
Good news is hard to find
And I work on the factory line
And all I do is stay behind
Call my mama like I should
She says daddy ain't doing too good
Me and him should wet a line
Just can't seem to find the time

But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright
When everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song

I finally saved some money up
'Til I had to fix my truck
Talked to brother the other day
He didn't have too much to say
Tryna quit these cigarettes
I can't seem to kick em yet
Sister got laid off last fall
And I got high cholesterol

But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright
When everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song

But I love my life
Man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright
When everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song
