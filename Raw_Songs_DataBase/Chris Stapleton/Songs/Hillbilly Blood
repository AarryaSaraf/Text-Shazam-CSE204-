Hillbilly blood, runnin' through my veins
Black coal soul and a mountain of pain
Jug of white lightning crossin' my lips
Hillbilly blood don't give a shit

Hillbilly blood, the river runs red
Finger on the trigger and a pound of lead
Chopper in the air, searchin' my land
A copperhead bites and don't give a goddamn

All the tongues at the tent revival
Been spittin' in the devil's eye
There ain't livin', there's just survival
Doesn't matter if you do or die
The way it is, is the way it was
Hillbilly blood, hillbilly blood

Hillbilly blood, thick as the night
Fog lays heavy on the morning light
Pike County sheriff trackin' my scent
Nobody gonna know where he went

All the tongues at the tent revival
Been spittin' in the devil's eye
There ain't livin', there's just survival
Doesn't matter if you do or die
And the way it is, is the way it was
Hillbilly blood, hillbilly blood
