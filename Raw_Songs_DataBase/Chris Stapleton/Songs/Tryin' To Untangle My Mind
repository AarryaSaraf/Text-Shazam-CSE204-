Well I drank a lot of whiskey in my time
And I've held a lot of women that were fine
And I've made a little money
I blew every dime
Tryin' to untangle my mind

Well I've made a lot of choices that were wrong
Let a good love spend too many nights alone
And I've been out on the edge
And I've stumbled 'cross the line
Tryin' to untangle my mind

So if you see me, and I'm lonesome and stoned
So far down, the devil's looking high
I'm just tryin' to untangle my mind

Well, I do what I do and I don't know why
But I'll do what I do, til the day I die
You know heartache wrote the ticket
So I guess I'll pay the fine
Tryin' to untangle my mind

If you see me, and I'm lonesome and stoned
So far down, the devil's looking high
I'm just tryin' to untangle my mind
Yes I'm tryin' to untangle my mind
