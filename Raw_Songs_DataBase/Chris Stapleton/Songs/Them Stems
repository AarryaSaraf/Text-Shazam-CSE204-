This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kind of shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

My dealer, he's been out of town
And that's really got me down
I hope he ain't up in the pen again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kind of shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

My baby, she done said goodbye
And all I ever do is cry
There ain't nothing round the house now to make me grin
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kind of shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

I called up this buddy of mine
'Cause we always have a real good time
I was hoping I could bum a toke off of him
But this morning he smoked them stems

This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kind of shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems
Yea, this morning I smoked them stems
