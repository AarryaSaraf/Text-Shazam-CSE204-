// Broken Halos //

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine

Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by

Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

// Last Thing I Needed, First Thing This Morning //

The postman delivered
A "past due" bill notice
The alarm clock rang two hours late
The garbage man left all the trash
On the sidewalk
And the hinges fell off the gate
And this morning at breakfast
I spilled all the coffee
And I opened a door on my knee

But the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

Last night you came home late
And I knew you'd been drinking
By that old mellow look on your face
I thought, "It don't matter
Because it's the holiday season"
And you fill such a big empty space
But then I laid down beside you
And I wanted your loving
Because your love makes my life complete

But the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

So excuse me for looking
Like my world just ended
And excuse me for looking
Like I just lost my best friend
And excuse me for loving
And being forgiven
So just go on if you want to be free

But the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

// Second One To Know //

Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know

Hold up my right hand
Swear to the Promise Land
I'd rather die before I treat you bad
All I ask of you
Is treat me the same way, too
Cause I don't want to lose this thing we have

Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know

First you stole my heart
That was the easy part
Don't ever tell me that crime don't pay
Now that it's in your hand
I want you to understand
I would've given it to you anyway

Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know

// Up To No Good Livin' //

Wish I could come home from workin'
And not have her checking my breath
I'm tired of her turning her questions
Into the Gettysburg Address

There's no reason why she shouldn't trust me
The fact that she don't makes me mad
Can't count all the times that I've begged her
Honey, just let my past be the past

I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town
I've finally grown up
I've finally changed
And that someone I was
Is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
You know I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down

Gave up on bringing her flowers
That just kept making things worse
I ain't been guilty of nothing
But being the man she deserves

I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People called me the Picasso of painting the town
I've finally grown up
I've finally changed
And that someone I was
Is somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
You know I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down

I used to cuss like a sailor and howl at the moon
I woke up some mornings with I-don't-know-who
But I never dreamed back then I'd have to pay for it now
You know, I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
Yeah, I'd hate to die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down

// Either Way //

We pass in the hall on our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk is when the monthly bills are due
We go to work, we go to church
We fake the perfect life

I'm past the point of give a damn
All my tears are cried

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

It's been so long since I felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't hate, you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all
I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
And it's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
I won't love you either way

We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

// I Was Wrong //

I've been thinking 'bout my thoughtless words
And I know just how much they must have hurt
And I take it back
Won't you let me take it back

You know I told you that I don't love you
That I'd be better off with someone new
But I take it back
Won't you let me take it back

Girl you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
I don't know why
I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that baby I was wrong

What I wouldn't give to be your lover again
All I want to do is touch your skin
If I had you right here right now
I'd tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you

Girl you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
I don't know why
I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that baby I was wrong

// Without Your Love //

Yesterday just came and went
And today dealt me another hand of heartaches that I'll play
What we said and what we meant
Two different things, just some words and rings
And time keeps raising the stakes

Tonight I'll find you in my dreams
And tomorrow I'll wake up and have to feel you fade away
That's the way it goes it seems
Tears filled with pain and they fall like rain
Constant reminders every day

Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm waiting on the sun to shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
And every moment's a crime

The more I live without you
Just can't forget about you
Nobody else can set me free
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come back to me

Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm just waiting on the sun to shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And I'm just doing my time
Without your love
And every moment's a crime

// Them Stems //

This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kind of shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

My dealer, he's been out of town
And that's really got me down
I hope he ain't up in the pen again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kind of shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

My baby, she done said goodbye
And all I ever do is cry
There ain't nothing round the house now to make me grin
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kind of shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems

I called up this buddy of mine
'Cause we always have a real good time
I was hoping I could bum a toke off of him
But this morning he smoked them stems

This morning I smoked them stems
Yeah, that's the kind of shape I'm in
I'm in a bad, bad way again
'Cause this morning I smoked them stems
Yea, this morning I smoked them stems

// Death Row //

Little piece of window sitting way up high
I can't look up enough to see the sky
There ain't no good light here below
Death Row
Death Row

Don't want no preacher man to come around
I don't need him to lay my burden down
Already told Jesus everything I know
Death Row
Death Row

When it's time for my last request
Tell my mama that I did my best
Tell my baby that I love her so
Death Row
Death Row
Death Row
Death Row

Got a calendar up on my wall
Marking days till I get the call
Till it's time for me to go
Death Row
Death Row
Death Row
