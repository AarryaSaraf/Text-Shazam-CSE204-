// Marieke //

Ay Marieke Marieke
Je t'aimais tant
Entre les tours
De Bruges et Gand
Ay Marieke Marieke
Il y a longtemps
Entre les tours
De Bruges et Gand

Zonder liefde warme liefde
Waait de wind de stomme wind
Zonder liefde warme liefde
Weent de zee de grijze zee
Zonder liefde warme liefde
Lijdt het licht het donk're licht
En schuurt het zand over mijn land
Mijn platte land mijn Vlaanderland

Ay Marieke Marieke
Le ciel flamand
Couleur des tours
De Bruges et Gand
Ay Marieke Marieke
Le ciel flamand
Pleure avec moi
De Bruges à Gand

Zonder liefde warme liefde
Waait de wind c'est fini
Zonder liefde warme liefde
Weent de zee déjà fini
Zonder liefde warme liefde
Lijdt het licht tout est fini
En schuurt het zand over mijn land
Mijn platte land mijn Vlaanderland

Ay Marieke Marieke
Le ciel flamand
Pesait-il trop
De Bruges à Gand
Ay Marieke Marieke
Sur tes vingt ans
Que j'aimais tant
De Bruges à Gand

Zonder liefde warme liefde
Lacht de duivel de zwarte duivel
Zonder liefde warme liefde
Brandt mijn hart mijn oude hart
Zonder liefde warme liefde
Sterft de zomer de droeve zomer
En schuurt het zand over mijn land
Mijn platte land mijn Vlaanderland

Ay Marieke Marieke
Revienne le temps
Revienne le temps
De Bruges et Gand
Ay Marieke Marieke
Revienne le temps
Où tu m'aimais
De Bruges à Gand

Ay Marieke Marieke
Le soir souvent
Entre les tours
De Bruges et Gand
Ay Marieke Marieke
Tous les étangs
M'ouvrent leurs bras
De Bruges à Gand

De Bruges à Gand
De Bruges à Gand

Yes Marieke Marieke in love we went
Between the towers of Bruges and Ghent
Yes Marieke Marieke so long we've spent
Between the towers of Bruges and Ghent

Cold and loveless cold and loveless
Blows the wind the wordless wind
Cold and loveless cold and loveless
Weeps the sea the old grey sea
Cold and loveless cold and loveless
Throbs the light the darkened light
With scouring sand across my land
My flat land my Flanders land

Yes Marieke Marieke the Flemish skies
Paint colours on the towers that rise
Yes Marieke Marieke the Flemish skies
Rain tears like those from my own eyes

Cold and loveless cold and loveless
Blows the wind it's over
Cold and loveless cold and loveless
Weeps the sea already over
Cold and loveless cold and loveless
Throbs the light everything's over
With scouring sand across my land
My flat land my Flanders land

Yes Marieke Marieke my back is bent
By Flemish skies from Bruges to Ghent
Yes Marieke Marieke those years that went
On loving you from Bruges to Ghent

Cold and loveless cold and loveless
Laughs the devil the old black devil
Cold and loveless cold and loveless
Burns my heart my ancient heart
Cold and loveless cold and loveless
Dies the summer the sombre summer
With scouring sand across my land
My flat land my Flanders land

Yes Marieke Marieke to bring it back
To bring it back from Bruges and Ghent
Yes Marieke Marieke to bring it back
That love I lack from Bruges to Ghent

Yes Marieke Marieke the skies lament
Between the towers of Bruges and Ghent
Yes Marieke Marieke my blood is spent
In every pool from Bruges to Ghent
From Bruges to Ghent from Bruges to Ghent

// Running For My Life //

Riding the night train, New York, to LA,
Gonna go and get me some sunshine.
Clipping along t'ward the Colorado Rockies,
Leaving you behind me.

There's a cold icy wind blowing like a demon
Off Lake Michigan.
I'm going where the weather is warm and the heat off.

You burned me out and you did me in,
You beat me at the game
I can not win.

I'm going where the pace is slower,
The stakes are lower.
I'm running for my life.

Tomorrow I'll wake up without you.
I'll curl my hair, and listen to my heart.
I don't want to hear a word about you,
I'll do what I care to do,
I'll do what I dare to do.
I'm running for my life.

I can see the switch man out in the freight yard,
Waving his lights at my train.
Red fir stopping my heart from beating,
Green for driving me insane.
And the rain is pouring,
And the wheels are rolling past that Nevada line
I'm going where the weather is hot,
And you are not.

I played the fool I believed your lies,
I danced till I was nearly paralyzed
I'm gone and going.
I'm running for my life

Tomorrow I'll wake up without you,
I'll get a room with windows on the sea
I'll do all the things I could never do,
You never will find me here
Not a thing to remind me here.
I'm running for my life

Sky's getting bright with California sunrise,
Shining its light on my train
Drying my tears soothing my fears,
Taking away my old pain.
And the engine's rockin' and the wheels are talkin'
About the tracks ahead,
I'm going where the world is new and the past is dead.
You brought me low and you got me high
I'm leaving you with my bridges burning,
There's no returning.

I'm running for my life
I'm running for me life

// Bright Morning Star //

Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Day is breaking in my soul

Oh, where are our dear fathers?
Oh, where are our dear fathers?
Across the valley working
Day is breaking in my soul

Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Day is breaking in my soul

Oh, where are our dear sisters?
Oh, where are our dear sisters?
They have gone to heaven shouting
Day is breaking in my soul

Oh, where is my dear Savior?
Oh, where is my dear Savior?
He is in my heart forever
Day is breaking in my soul

Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Day is breaking in my soul

// Green Finch And Linnet Bird //

Green Finch and Linnet bird
Nightingale, Blackbird
How is it you sing?

How can you jubilate
Sitting in cages
Never taking wing?

Outside the sky waits
Beckoning, beckoning
Just beyond the bars

How can you remain
Staring at the rain
Maddened by the stars?

How is it you sing anything?
How is it you sing?

Green Finch and Linnet bird
Nightingale, Blackbird
How is it you sing?

Whence comes this melody
Constantly floating?
Is it rejoicing or merely a loaming?

Are you discussing?
Or fussing
Or simply dreaming?

Are you crowing?
Are you screaming?
Ring dove and Robinet

Is it for wages?
Singing to be sold?
Have you decided it's safer in cages
Singing when you're told?

My cage has many rooms
Damask and dark
Nothing there sings
Not even my Lark

Larks never will, you know
When they're captive
Teach me to be more adaptive

Green Finch and Linnet bird
Nightingale, Blackbird
Teach me how to sing

If I cannot fly
Let me sing

// Pretty Women //

Pretty women, fascinating
Sipping coffee, dancing
Pretty women are a wonder

Pretty women sitting in the window
Standing on the stair
Something in them cheers the air

Pretty women, silhouetted
Stay within' you, glancing
Stay forever, breathing lightly

Pretty women, pretty women
Blowing out their candles or combing out their hair
Even when they leave, they still are there

Pretty women in their gardens
How they make a man sing
Proof of heaven as you're living

Pretty women, pretty women
Blowing out their candles or combing out their hair
Even when they leave, they still are there, they're there

Ah, pretty women at their mirrors
How they make a man sing
Proof of heaven as you're living
Pretty women, pretty women, pretty women

// Almost Free //

Last night you pushed me a little too far
I was not coming back when I was left in the car
There was a time about an hour or two
When I was feeling so free from you

Pick up a bottle and drove to the heights
I packed on the ridge and looked at the light
The engine was off and the radio on
And the singer sang and I sang along

I was almost free
There are most poison in you and me
I was almost free
On new life ahead of me
Almost free

The sun rise rising over the will
The bottle's empty and so is the feel
This car knows that it's the wrong thing to do
But it's driving me home to you

Maybe I'm too much in love to be strong
Maybe there's one way to be gone
A few more pills a little more wine
And I can get very hard to find

And I feel almost free
There are most tears in you and me
I feel almost free
On new life ahead of me

Sun rise rising over the will
The bottle's empty and so is the feel
A few more pills a little more wine
I can get very hard to find

And I feel almost free
There are most tears in you and me
I feel almost free
On new life ahead of me
Almost free

// I Could Really Show You Around //

I could really show you around
I could bail you out of the lost and found
I can see you're big city bound
By the way you came off the Greyhound

I could really show you around
I could dress you up and then we could live it down
You could be surrounded by luxury
If you leave it up to me

After all
What have you got to lose
I've got it all
So how can you refuse
And after all
The things I'll do for you
And all you have to do
Is let me take you home

I could sweep you up in a flash
I'll make you forget that you're short of cash
Think of all the parties we'll crash
With all of the high class and all of the trash

I could really show you around
I could buy the brushes and we could paint the town
From the underground to the penthouse floor
'Cause my name can open doors

After all
What have I got to lose
You've got it all
And all I've got's the blues
After all
The things I'll do for you
And all you have to do
Is let me take you home

Calla lilies, cognac and Cadillacs
Caviar and coke and a charge at Sak's
Breakfast in my bed when you wake up at noon
Trips to the island, trips to the moon

I could really show you around
I could really show you around
I could really show you around
Let me show you around
Show you around

// I've Done Enough Dyin' Today //

What will we do now? You tell me
The hourglass is all out of sand
How could love slip through our fingers
And leave nothing but time on our hands?
And how will we live now? You tell me
With parts of our hearts torn away
Just existing makes dyin' look easy
But maybe tomorrow, I've done enough dying today

And how will I sleep now? You tell me
With only my arm by my side
Perhaps I'll learn sleeping all over
Or just maybe without dreaming this time
And who'll make you laugh now? You tell me
Since you've sent your clown on her way
I don't think I'll cry, just die laughing
But maybe tomorrow, I've done enough dying today

Just existing makes dying look easy
But maybe tomorrow, I've done enough dying today

// Anyone Would Love You //

Speaking impartially, not at all personally
Just from a general point of view
Anyone would love you, anyone at all
Anyone with any sense is bound to fall

I'm sure that anyone whose heart is free
Meeting you, would say "Here's love at last"
"Here's every lonely dream come true"
Oh, anyone, believe me, would love you

I'm sure that anyone whose heart is free
Meeting you, would say "Here's love at last"
"Here's every lonely dream come true"
Oh, anyone, believe me, would love you

// The Rainbow Connection //

Why are there so many songs about rainbows
And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions but only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide

So we've been told and some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong, wait and see
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me

Who said that every wish would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star?
Somebody thought of that and someone believed it
Look what it's done so far

What's so amazing that keeps us star gazing
And what do we think we might see?
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me

All of us under it's spell
We know that it's probably magic

Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound that calls all the sailors?
The voice might be one and the same

I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me

La la la la, la la la
The lovers, the dreamers and me

// This Is The Day //

I used to think that some other time
Past or future would be sublime
Maybe as the empress in a crimson robe
In the Ming Dynasty
Or as the captain of a star space probe
To a distant galaxy
In the year 2003
But then one day watching the snow
Every flake distinct as a song
Here for an instant
Here then gone
I learned something
I had known all along

This is the present I bought myself today
Wrapped in paper the color of sky
Oh what a miracle, oh what a buy
Today, today, today what will unfold?

This present set in its box of gold today
Yesterday may have been fair or fine
Nothing I do now can change it
Tomorrow may not ever come
But this day is mine
This is the present I bought just for today
I took today off the shelf
Polished it up
Gave it a spin
Knew it would invite me in today

This is the present I'll never give away
Making a snowflake design
In the rain or in the sunshine
Today, today, today this present is mine

// Wedding Song //

There is a bamboo tree 
that blooms only once in a hundred years
This is the year, your wedding year
And the bamboo blossoms just for you

For you the Columbine is blue
The paint brush flames upon the hills
For Allison and Denver John
A double sunrise lights the dawn

I've watched you blossom since you met
You've made a garden out of love
With splendid flowers and bowered paths
Where I am satisfied to walk

There was a thorn in Denver's side
That Allison has pruned and clipped
A sorrow Allison could hide
That Denver soothed and comforted

Each tending to the others need
Tears and smiles looked after now
The thorns and sorrows have their place
In proper balance, like the stars

You are both brave and beautiful
My brother, whom I've loved for life
And now a sister, newly mine
To love and treasure day and night

Home to the mountains, then, we come
To celebrate in unison
All peace, and pleasure, joy and bliss
To Denver John and Allison

Today for you the Columbine is blue
The paint brush flames upon the hills
For Allison and Denver John
A double sunrise lights the dawn
