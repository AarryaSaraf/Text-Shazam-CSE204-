Album: GoldenApplesOfTheSun

// Golden Apples Of The Sun //

I went out to the hazelwood
Because a fire was in my head
Cut and peeled a hazel wand
And hooked a berry to a thread

And when white moths were on the wing
And moth-like stars were flickering out
I dropped the berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout

When I had laid it on the ground
And gone to blow the fire aflame
Something rustled on the floor
And someone called me by my name

It had become a glimmering girl
With apple blossom in her hair
Who called me by my name and ran
And vanished in the brightening air

Though I am old with wandering
Through hollow lands and hilly lands
I will find out where she has gone
And see her lips and take her hand

And walk through long green dappled grass
And pluck till time and times are done
The silver apples of the moon
The golden apples of the sun

// Bonnie Ship The Diamond //

The Diamond is a ship my boys, for Greenland she is bound
And the quay it is all garnished with bonny lassies 'round
The captain gives the order to sail the ocean wide
Where the sun it never sets my lads, no darkness dims the tide

So cheer up my lads let your hearts never fail
While the bonnie ship, the Diamond goes fishin' for the whale

Along the quay at Peterhead, the lassies stand around
With their shawls about their heads and salt tears runnin' down
I'll never weep my bonny lad though I'm left behind
For there's not a rose on Greenland's ice to make you change your mind

So cheer up my lads let your hearts never fail
While the bonnie ship, the Diamond goes fishin' for the whale

Here's a health to the resolution likewise the Eliza Swan
A health to the Battle of Montrose and the Diamond ship of fame
They wear the trousers of the white the jackets of the blue
When they return to Peterhead they'll find that we've been true

So cheer up my lads let your hearts never fail
While the bonnie ship, the Diamond goes fishin' for the whale

It'll be bright both day and night when the Greenland lads come home
With a ship that's full of oil my lads and money to their name
They'll make the cradles for to rock and the blankets for to tear
And every lass in Peterhead sing hush-a-bye my dear

So cheer up my lads let your hearts never fail
While the bonnie ship, the Diamond goes fishin' for the whale

// Little Brown Dog //

I buyed me a little dog its color it was brown
Taught him to whistle to sing and dance and run
His legs they were fourteen yards long his ears they were broad
Round the world in half a day on him I could ride
Sing terry O' day

I buyed me a little bull he was four inches high
Everybody feared him who ever heard him cry
When he began to bellow he made such melodious sound
That all the walls in London came tumblin' to the ground
Sing terry O day
Sing taddle day

I buyed me a flock of sheep thought they were all wethers
Sometimes they yielded wool sometimes yielded feathers
I know mine are the very best sheep for yield and increase
Every full and turn of the moon they bring forth lambs and geese
Sing terry O day
Sing taddle day

I buyed me a little glass colored it was green
In it was all the wonders man has ever seen
I put in my pocket tied up with a cloth
Cried and cried the day I found that it had been lost
Sing terry O day
Sing taddle day

I buyed me a little dog its color it was brown
Taught him to whistle to sing and dance and run
His legs they were fourteen yards long his ears they were broad
Round the world in half a day on him I could ride
Sing terry O day
Sing terry O day

// Twelve Gates To The City //

Three gates in the east, three gates in the west
Three gates in the north, three gates in the south
That makes twelve gates to the city, hallelujah

Oh, what a beautiful city
Oh, what a beautiful city
Oh, what a beautiful city
There're twelve gates to the city, hallelujah

Walk right in, you're welcome to the city
Step right up, welcome to the city
Walk right through those gates to the city
There're twelve gates to the city, hallelujah

Oh, what a beautiful city
Oh, what a beautiful city
Oh, what a beautiful city
There're twelve gates to the city, hallelujah

Who are those children all dressed in red
Twelve gates to the city
Must be the children that Moses sent
There're twelve gates to the city, hallelujah

Rich and the poor, welcome to the city
Young and the old, welcome to the city
Weak and the strong, welcome to the city
There're twelve gates to the city, hallelujah

Oh, what a beautiful city
Oh, what a beautiful city
Oh, what a beautiful city
There're twelve gates to the city, hallelujah

Oh, what a beautiful city
Oh, what a beautiful city
Oh, what a beautiful city
There're twelve gates to the city, hallelujah

// Christ Child Lullaby //

My love, my pride, my treasure, O
My wonder new and pleasure, O
My son, my beauty, ever You
Who am I to bear You here?

The cause of talk and tale am I
The cause of greatest fame am I
The cause of proudest care on high
To have for mine, the king of all

And though You are the king of all
They sent You to the manger stall
Where at Your feet they all shall fall
And glorify my child the king

There shone a star above three kings,
To guide them to the king of kings.
They held You in their humble arms
And knelt before You until dawn.

They gave You myrrh they gave You gold
Frankincense and gifts untold
They traveled far these gifts to bring,
And glorify their newborn king.

My love, my pride, my treasure, O
My wonder new and pleasure, O
My son, my beauty, ever You
Who am I to bear You here?

// Great Selchie Of Shule Skerry //

In Norway, there sits a maid
By lou, my baby, she begins
Little know I my child's father
Or if land or sea he's livin' in

Then there arose at her bed feet
And a grumbly guest
I'm sure it was he
Saying here am I thy child's father
Although that I am not comely

I am a man upon the land
I am a selchie in the sea
And when I am in my own country
My dwellin' is in Shule Skerry
And he hath taken a purse of gold
He hath put it upon her knee
Saying give to me my little wee son
And take thee up thy nurse's fee

And it shall come to pass
On a summer day
When the sun shines hot
On every stone
That I shall take my little wee son
And I'll teach him for to swim in the foam
And you will marry a gunner good
And a proud good gunner I'm sure he'll bev 
And he'll go out on a May morning
And he'll kill both my wee son and me

And lo, she did marry a gunner good
And a proud good gunner I'm sure it was he
And the very first shot that ere he did shoot
He killed the son and the great selchie

In Norway, there sits a maid
By lou, my baby, she begins
Little know I my child's father
Or if land or sea he's livin' in

// Tell Me Who I'll Marry //

Tell me who I'll marry, tell me who he'll be
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree

Here's a builder come to woo you
No one can build a house like he can
Fondly he tells you that he loves you
As he loves his houses

I would wed my builder
But I'm sorry for my handsome weaver
I would wed my builder but
I'm sorry for my handsome weaver

Tell me who I'll marry, tell me who he'll be
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree

Here's a weaver come to woo you
Weaving a garland with his fingers
Fondly he tells you that he loves you
As he loves his weaving

I would wed my weaver
But I'm sorry for my handsome turner
I would wed my weaver but
I'm sorry for my handsome turner

Tell me who I'll marry, tell me who he'll be
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree

Here's a turner come to woo you
All round his length the sparks are showering
Fondly he tells you that he loves you
As he loves his capstan

I would wed my turner
But I have someone else to give my heart to
I would wed my turner but
I've someone else to give my heart to

Tell me who I'll marry, tell me who he'll be
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree

Tell me who I'll marry, tell me who he'll be
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree
While the Vistula is flowing
By the green oak tree

// Fannerio //

As we march down to Fannerio
As we march down to Fannerio
Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
And we called her by her name pretty Peggy O

What will your mother think pretty Peggy O?
What will your mother think pretty Peggy O?
What will your mother think but I hear the guineas clink?
And the soldiers marchin' behind you O

You shall ride in a coach pretty Peggy O
You shall ride in a coach pretty Peggy O
You shall ride in a coach with your true love by your side
As fine as any lady in the country O

And when I return pretty Peggy O
When I return pretty Peggy O
When I return, the city I will burn
And destroy all the ladies in the country O

Come trippin' down the stairs pretty Peggy O
Come trippin' down the stairs pretty Peggy O
Come trippin' down the stairs combin' back your yellow hair
Bid your last farewell to sweet William O

Sweet William he is dead pretty Peggy O
Sweet William is dead pretty Peggy O
Sweet William is dead and he died for a maid
He's buried in the Louisiana country O

As we march down to Fannerio
As we march down to Fannerio
Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
And we called her by her name pretty Peggy O

// Crow On The Cradle //

The sheep's in the meadow, the cow's in the corn
Now is the time for a child to be born
He'll cry at the moon and he'll laugh at the sun
If he's a boy he'll carry a gun
Sang the crow on the cradle

If it should be that our baby's a girl
Never you mind if her hair doesn't curl
Rings on her fingers, bells on her toes
A bomber above her wherever she goes
Sang the crow on the cradle

Rockabye baby, the dark and the light
Somebody's baby is born for a fight
Rockabye baby, the white and the black
Somebody's baby is not coming back
Sang the crow on the cradle

Your mother and father they'll scrap and they'll save
Build you a coffin and dig you a grave
Hush a bye little one, why do you weep?
We have a toy that will put you to sleep
Sang the crow on the cradle

Bring me a gun and I'll shoot that bird dead
That's what your father and mother once said
Crow on the cradle, what shall I do?
That is the thing I'll leave up to you
Sang the crow on the cradle

// Lark In The Morning //

The lark in the morning she rises off her nest
And goes off in the air with the dew on her breast
Like a jolly plough boy she whistles and she sings
And comes home in the evening with the dew on her wings

Roger the ploughboy he is a bonny blade
He goes whistlin' and singin' through yonder long shade
He met with dark-eyed Susan she's handsome I declare
And he bought her rows of ribbon for to roll around her hair

He met with dark eyed Susan she's handsome I declare
And she's far more enticing than the birds in the air

// Sing Hallelujah //

I know I got a long journey
Sing Hallelujah
Better get started early
Sing Hallelujah

Sing out for the Lord to help you
The Lord is mighty strong
Don't worry 'bout your heavy load
The Lord's gonna help you along

Last night I heard my Lord a-callin'
Sing Hallelujah
"Sinner, better quit your stallin'"
Sing Hallelujah

Sing out for the Lord to help you
The Lord is mighty strong
Don't worry 'bout your heavy load
The Lord's gonna help you along

Goin' down to the river Jordan
Sing Hallelujah
The boat to Heaven is the one I'm boardin'
Sing Hallelujah

Sing out for the Lord to help you
The Lord is mighty strong
Don't worry 'bout your heavy load
The Lord's gonna help you along

Sing out for the Lord to help you
The Lord is mighty strong
Don't worry 'bout your heavy load
The Lord's gonna help you along

I know I got a long journey
Sing Hallelujah
I better get started early
Sing Hallelujah

Sing out for the Lord to help you
The Lord is mighty strong
Don't worry 'bout your heavy load
The Lord's gonna help you along

// Shule Aroon //

Shule, shule, shule aroon
Shule the agaragar, shule the coon
Shule, shule, shule aroon
I blink up anyone, should tie me, oh

Here I sit on buttermilk hill
Weep I will and weep my fill
Every tear would turn a mill
Johnny is gone for a soldier

Shule, shule, shule aroon
Shule the agaragar, shule the coon
Shule, shule, shule aroon
I blink up anyone, should tie me, oh

I'll sell my flax, sell my meal
Sell my only spinnin' wheel
Buy my love, a sword of steel
Johnny's gone for a soldier

Shule, shule, shule aroon
Shule the agaragar, shule the coon
Shule, shule, shule aroon
I blink up anyone, should tie me, oh

Loved him, oh, I loved him so
Broke my heart to see him go
Only time can heal my woe
Johnny's gone for a soldier

Shule, shule, shule aroon
Shule the agaragar, shule the coon
Shule, shule, shule aroon
I blink up anyone, should tie me, oh

I sold my flax and my meal
Sold my only spinnin' wheel
Now he's dead upon the field
Johnny's gone for a soldier

Shule, shule, shule aroon
Shule the agaragar, shule the coon
Shule, shule, shule aroon
I blink up anyone, should tie me, oh
