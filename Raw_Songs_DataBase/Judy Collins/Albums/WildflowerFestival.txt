// Thirsty Boots //

You've long been on the open road
You've been sleepin' in the rain
From dirty words and mud of the cells
Your clothes are soiled and stained

But the dirty words and the muddy cells
Will soon be judged insane
So only stop and rest yourself
And you'll be off again

And take off your thirsty boots
And stay for a while
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile

And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

Then tell me of the ones you see
As far as you could see
Across the plains from field to town
A marchin' to be free

And of the rusted prison gates
That tumble by degree
Like laughin' children one by one
They look like you and me

So take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile

And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

I know you are no stranger
Down the crooked rainbow trial
From dancing cliff edge, shattered sills
Of slander shackled jails

But the melodies drift up from below
As walls are bein' scaled
Yes and all of this and more my friend
Your song shall not be failed

And take off your thirsty boots
And stay for a while
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile

And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

And take off your thirsty boots
And stay for a while
Your feet are hot and weary
From a dusty mile

And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

// City Of New Orleans //

Riding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail

On the southbound odyssey
The train goes out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields
Passin' trains that have no name
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyard of the rusted automobiles

Good morning America how are you
Don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Playin' cards with the old men in the club car
A penny a point ain't no one keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
And feel the wheels rumblin' beneath the floor

And the sons of pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpet made of steam
Mothers with their babes asleep
Rocking to the gentle beat
The rhythm of the rails is all they dream

Good morning America how are you
Don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Half way home, and we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea

And all the towns and people seem
To change into a bad dream
The steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again
Passengers will please refrain
This train's got to disappear in railroad blues

Good night, America, how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done

I'll be gone a million miles when the race is run

I'll be goooone
