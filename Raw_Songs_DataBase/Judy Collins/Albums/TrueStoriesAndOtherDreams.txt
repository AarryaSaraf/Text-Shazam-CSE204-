// Cook With Honey //

Muffin warm and basket brown
Smiling faces gathered round our dinner table
Close together, hand in hand

I always cook with honey
To sweeten up the night
We always cook with honey
Tell me, how's your appetite
For some sweet love

Find in favor with your neighbor
Well, it can be so fine
It's easier than pie to be kind
We've been searching for so long
Now our house has turned into a home

'Cause I always cook with honey
To sweeten up the night
We always cook with honey
Tell me, how's your appetite
For some sweet love

'Cause I always cook with honey
To sweeten up the night
We always cook with honey
Tell me, how's your appetite
For some sweet love

Well, our door is always open
And there's surely room for more
Cooking where there's good love
Is never any chore
So come and get to know us
There'll be a place set just for you
Sweet wine before dinner
That is surely bound to soothe

I always cook with honey
To sweeten up the night
We always cook with honey
Tell me, how's your appetite
For some sweet love

I always cook with honey
To sweeten up the night
We always cook with honey
Tell me, how's your appetite
For some sweet love

// So Begins The Task //

Now begins the task
I have dreaded the coming of for so long
I wait for the sun
To remind my body it needs restin'

And I must learn to live without you now
As I cannot learn to give only part somehow

Camping on the edge of your city I wait
Hoping someday you might see beyond yourself

Shadows on the ceiling
Hard but not real
Like the bars that cage you within yourself

And I must learn to live without you now
As I cannot learn to give only part somehow

And I must learn to live without you now
As I cannot learn to give only part somehow

All of these cages
Must and shall be set aside
They will only keep us from the knowing

Actors and stages now fall before the truth
As the love shared between us remains growing

And I must learn to live without you now
As I cannot learn to give only part somehow

And I must learn to live without you now
As I cannot learn to give only part somehow

// Fishermen Song //

The fisherman are pitching pennies
In the sand beside the sea
The sunrise hits their oilskin boots
And their painted boats and me
They seem to know the ocean
Like a man knows a woman
She makes him wait around for half the morning
For the tide to turn

Pull on the ropes, Seine haul fisherman
Never catches more than he knows
He can sell in a day;
Pull on the ropes, Seine haul fisherman
Day's for work. Night's the time to go dancing

They're drinking beer and laughing
And squinting at the sun
Waiting for the gulls to tell them
When the fish will come
Their faces brown and weathered
From all the nets they've run
They've learned to wait
They always know that the tide will turn

Pull on the ropes, Seine haul fisherman
Never catches more than he knows
He can sell in a day;
Pull on the ropes, Seine haul fisherman
Day's for work. Night's the time to go dancing

Way out on the ocean
The big ships hunt for whales
The Japanese have caught so many
That now they hunt for snails
My fisherman's not greedy
He seems content to live
With the sun and the sand
And a net full of fish when the tide turns

Pull on the ropes, Seine haul fisherman
Never catches more than he knows
He can sell in a day;
Pull on the ropes, Seine haul fisherman
Day's for work. Night's the time to go dancing

Pull on the ropes, Seine haul fisherman
Never catches more than he knows
He can sell in a day;
Pull on the ropes, Seine haul fisherman
Day's for work. Night's the time to go dancing

// The Dealer (Down And Losin') //

Jack of diamonds, queen of spades
Fingers tremble and the memory fades
And it's a foolish man who tries to bluff the dealer

Jokers laughed and Lady Luck smiled
The aces were high and the deuces were wild
When you're down and losin', everyone's a cheater

You can't win and you can't break even
You can't get out of the game
You shouldn't stay but you ain't leavin'
'Cos your luck may change again

Life's a lot like that, my friend
Luck runs out and the winning streak ends
When the deck is stacked you can't trust the dealer
Just when things were going fine
Someone jumped you from behind
When you're down and losin', everyone's a cheater

You got a little more than you bargained for
A little more than you had in mind
You took your chance but
Twenty-one beats nineteen every time

Jack of diamonds, queen of spades
Fingers tremble and the memory fades
And it's a foolish man who tries to bluff the dealer

Jokers laughed and Lady Luck smiled
The aces were high and the deuces were wild
When you're down and losin', everyone's a cheater

// Holly Ann //

She is a weaver
Through her hands the bright thread travels
Blue green water, willows weeping, silver stars

She sings and sighs as the shuttle flies
Through the yarn like a Kerry dancer
Pink and purple velvet red for a lover's bed

Living north of San Francisco
With a man who built his house alone
Living peaceful in the country
The lights of the golden gate will lead her home

She is a spinner
In her hands the wooden wheel turns the wool around
Then around again

A gypsy from Bolinas
Sits and plays the mandolin
Faces smile in the firelight of a foggy night

Living north of San Francisco
Sometimes it's nice to be alone
She says, it's peaceful where she is living
The lights of the golden gate will lead her home

You can see the bridges of the city
Hanging in the air by steel and stone
She says, it's peaceful where she's living
The lights of the golden gate will lead her home

She is a weaver
Through her hand the bright thread travels
Blue green water, willows weeping, silver stars

She is my sister
The baby born when I was older
Her hands are light, her hair is bright as the summer sun

Living north of San Francisco
Sometimes it's nice to be alone
She says, it's peaceful in the country
The lights of the golden gate will lead her home

The lights of the golden gate will lead her home

// The Hostage //

I'm a guard in the great iron prison, at least I was 'till now.
It was never a picnic social, never a day.
They never come in laughing and you know they never taught them how
It was damn hard work, and you wouldn't believe the pay.

It was early in the morning, Lord, I wasn't but half awake,
When the cons went nuts, and took us by surprise.
I never was one for shaking, but I found it hard to stand,
With a six-inch blade held right between my eyes.

We could hear a siren blowing, somebody yelled in pain.
Then it got so quiet, you could hear a bird walk by.
They all had masks on their faces, and they spoke with a voice of Cain
"If they come in shooting, then you know you're bound to die.
If they come in shooting, then you know you're bound to die."

I turned to a buddy named Willie, I said "Willie, It'll be all right,
If they meant to kill us we'd be half way down to Hell.
See, they high-jacked a plane in the desert, and the government screamed and cries,
But to save some lives, they opened up a prison cell".

So the days kept coming and going, tension was getting high.
But I wasn't too worried, I figured I knew the score.
I knew they were talking to someone, I knew they were willing to try.
So I figured my freedom was a matter of a day or two more.

But, Jesus, early this morning, the whirlybird dropped the gas,
It made me puke and it brought me to my knees.
The bullets came like hail-stones, I heard the first ones pass,
Then they cut down Willie, and they got Jim Kelly and me.
They cut down Willie, and they got Jim Kelly and me.

They come in yelling curses, like they were crossing the River Rhine
Shot down every God-damned thing they saw.
And while I lay there wounded, I took another one in my spine,
Poor Jim Kelly took another one in his jaw.
Oh, Poor Jim Kelly took another one in his jaw.

They say we had our throats cut by a band of desperate men,
Say they saved as many of us as they could.
Well the governor he should know it, but I think I'll say it again
That the governor cut my throat and he cut it good.

Let them take the governor, hold him for a couple of days.
See who goes in shooting to set him free.
Hell they'd open every jail in the country, they'd send them on their way
They'd never do to him what the governor done to me.
They'd never do to him what the governor done to me.

// Song For Martin //

In Rough Rock, Arizona he lived for many years alone
A gangly kid from Colorado, who could sing the sweetest songs
I first heard Woody's songs from him in a cabin in the snow
Seems like it was yesterday but it was years and years ago

He moved to Arizona in nineteen sixty-one
Got a job at the Indian school - he was livin' in the sun
My life was movin' fast by now, I was always on the run
My country life was far behind and the circus had begun

Marty, I know it got lonely out there
Coyotes cryin' at midnight in the cold desert air
The heart that sorrow broke in you can never be repaired
Mart, I know I let you down somewhere

I knew that me and Marty, we should have been good friends
I always knew the paths we walked were meant to cross again
We talked on the telephone once or twice a year
His voice was so familiar, his memory was clear

I'll never know what brought him to where he finally stood
A shotgun pointed at his head in a cabin in the woods
But somehow I could hear it, it struck my heart as well
For the unknown man who needs a hand
For the friend I'll never know

Marty, I know it got lonely out there
Coyotes cryin' at midnight in the cold desert air
The heart that sorrow broke in you can never be repaired
Mart, I know I let you down somewhere

// Che //

One morning in Bolivia, the leader of the partisans
And two of his companions
Were forced to flee the mountains for their lives

Through green and dusty villages they sped along the little roads
The peasants smiled and shouted as they hurried by
Jesus called out to every one, "Don't think that we are leaving
They only tried to frighten us with guns, we shall return"

Continue with your work
Continue with your talk
You have it in your hands
To own your lives, to own your lands

The people smiled and shouted
And they ran along a little while
Then stood and watched
Their hands were restless and empty

The body of Jesus was in the jeep
That they blew up before it reached the plane
The priest was proud to bless him
For what there was of him remaining in the afternoon

Continue with your work
Continue with your talk
You have it in your hands
To own your lives, to own your lands

There is no one who can show you
The road you should be on
They only tell you, they can show you
And then tomorrow they are gone

The smell of oil and incense fill the room in this adobe hut
Where on the table lies the body of a man
His face is pale and young, his beard is dark and curled
Pennies hold his eyelids from the evening light

People from the village those who knew him, those who killed him
Stand inside the door, their hands are restless and empty
They watch the priest make silent crosses in the air
And pray to God inside their hearts for their own souls

Continue with your work
Continue with your talk
You have it in your hands
To own your lives, to own your lands

There is no one who can show you
The road you should be on
They only tell you, they can show you
And then tomorrow they are gone

Continue with your work
Continue with your talk
You have it in your hands
To own your lives, to own your lands

There is no one who can show you
The road you should be on
They only tell you, they can show you
And then tomorrow they are gone

Continue with your work
Continue with your talk
You have it in your hands
To own your lives, to own your lands

There is no one who can show you
The road you should be on
They only tell you, they can show you
And then tomorrow they are gone

Continue with your work
Continue with your talk
You have it in your hands
To own your lives, to own your lands
