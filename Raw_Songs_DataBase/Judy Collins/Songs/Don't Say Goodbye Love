Love don't say you can't forgive me
How can I bear to live if you say goodbye?
God has mercy, can't you spare some?
I am begging you to stay, if it's just a lie

I'll take the crumbs you leave at my door
I just can't bear not to see you anymore
Those years of love can't be gone
Take me with you, don't leave me here alone

Don't say goodbye love
I couldn't bear to hear it
Don't say goodbye love
It's what I've always feared

Nightmares come, I know, I've had one
Why can't I be awake? Say it's just a dream
This is all too real for dreaming
Like something in a play, truer then it seems

How did your face of love turn to hate?
Only a moment passed, now it is too late
Blind to the truth I have loved
Lost for now, I am helpless without you

Don't say goodbye love
I couldn't bear to hear it
Don't say goodbye love
It's what I've always feared

High above, the moon is riding
Clouds covering her face so she can not see
Tears are falling from my own eyes
Hope dying in my heart, struggles to be free

I want to hide in the past
Where I thought that I'd found love at last
Love that would suffer my sins
Love that would let me begin to live

Don't say goodbye love
I couldn't bear to hear it
Don't say goodbye love
It's what I've always feared

Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
