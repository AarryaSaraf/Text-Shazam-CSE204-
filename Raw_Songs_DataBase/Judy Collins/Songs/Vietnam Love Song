My lover is dead
He died in the battle of Plei Me
My lover is dead
He died in the battle of Tong Sa
My lover is dead
He died in the battle of Dong Ha
My lover is dead
He died in the battle of A Shau
My lover is dead
He died in the battle of Ba Gia

Died in the jungle undergrowth
Died in the rushing river
Died at the entrance to the pass
Died underneath the railroad bridge
Died so suddenly, died so gradually

Died long ago, died last winter
Died this morning, in his new uniform
Died stark naked, denouncing Americans
Died in silence, died hating, died loving
My lover is dead

My lover is alive
My lover, Vietnam
