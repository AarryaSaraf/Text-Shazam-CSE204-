Goin' down that highway, goin' to another town.
Honey when I find what I'm looking for, maybe I'll settle down. 

Why don't you help me brother, I'm a stranger in your town
Why don't you help me brother, maybe I'll settle down.

Worked my way from Boston to the San Francisco Bay
But honey what I've been looking for, I didn't find along the way. 

Why don't you help me brother, I'm a stranger in your town
Why don't you help me brother, maybe I'll settle down.

I've never been contented no matter where I roam
It ain't no fun to see a settin' sun when you're far from home. 

Why don't you help me brother, I'm a stranger in your town
Why don't you help me brother, maybe I'll settle down.
Why don't you help me brother, I'm a stranger in your town
Why don't you help me brother, and maybe I'll settle down.
