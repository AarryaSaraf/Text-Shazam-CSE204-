Ohh, the summer time is coming
And the leaves are sweetly turning
And the wild mountain thyme
Blooms around the purple heather

Will you go? Laddie go
And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the purple heather
Will you go? Laddie go

If my true love will not go
I will surely find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the purple heather

Will you go? Laddie go
And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the purple heather
Will you go? Laddie go
