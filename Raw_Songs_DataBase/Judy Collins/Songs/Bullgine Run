Well, the smartest clipper you could find
Heave away, haul away
Is the Margot Evans on the Black Ball Line
Clear away the track and let the bullgine run

Tell me now, are you most done?
Heave away, haul away
Every day we're closer to home
Clear away the track and let the bullgine run

Well, tell me now, are you bound to go
Heave away, haul away
Off to Greenland where there's ice and snow?
Clear away the track and let the bullgine run

Tell me now, are you bound to sail
Heave away, haul away
Off to Greenland to catch the whale?
Clear away the track and let the bullgine run

Well, I though I heard my captain say
Heave away, haul away
"In another week we'll get more pay"
Clear away the track and let the bullgine run

Tell me now, are you most done?
Heave away, haul away
Every day we're closer to home
Clear away the track and let the bullgine run

Well, the smartest clipper you could find
Heave away, haul away
Is the Margot Evans on the Black Ball Line
Clear away the track and let the bullgine run
