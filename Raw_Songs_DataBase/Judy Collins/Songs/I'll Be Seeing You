Cathedral bells were tolling and our hearts rang on
Was this the thrill of Paris or the April dawn?
Who knows if we shall meet again
But when the morning chimes ring sweet again

I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In the small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, the chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's bright and gay, I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you in the morning sun and when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon but I'll be seeing you

I'll find you in the morning sun and when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon but I'll be seeing you
