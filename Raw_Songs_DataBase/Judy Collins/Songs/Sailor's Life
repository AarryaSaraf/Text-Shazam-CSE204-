Oh, a sailor's life is a weary life
For he robs the girls of their delight
Causes them to weep, causes them to mourn
Loss of a true love, never to return

Oh, Father, Father, build me a boat
And on the world's oceans, I will float
Hail each captain, as I pass by
There, I'll ask for my sailor boy

Oh, captain, captain, tell me true
Does my own Willie sail with you?
Tell me soon, to give me joy
None will I have but my sailor boy

Oh no, kind lady, he's not here
He drowned in the gulf, and we buried him there
On the island, as we passed by
There, we left your sailor boy

Oh, she rung her hands, and tore her hair
Just like some lady in great despair
Called for a chair to sit her down
Penningdon for, to write it down

Oh, dig my grave wide and deep
Put a marble stone at the head and feet
On my grave, a turtle dove
Tell the world, I died for my love

Oh, a sailor's life is a weary life
He robs the girls of their delight
Causes them to weep, causes them to mourn
Loss of a true love, never to return
