One day at a time sweet Jesus

I'm only human, I'm just a woman
Help me believe in what I could be
And all that I am

Show me the stairway, I have to climb
Lord for my sake, teach me to take
One day at a time

One day at a time sweet Jesus
That's all I'm askin' from You
Just give me the strength
To do everyday what I have to do

Yesterday's gone sweet Jesus
And tomorrow may never be mine
Lord help me today, show me the way
One day at a time

Do you remember when You walked among men?
Well Jesus You know if You're lookin' below
That it's worse now than then

Cheatin' and stealin' there's violence and crime
So for my sake, teach me to take
One day at a time

One day at a time sweet Jesus
That's all I'm askin' from You
Just give me the strength
To do everyday what I have to do

Yesterday's gone sweet Jesus
And tomorrow may never be mine
Lord help me today, show me the way
One day at a time
