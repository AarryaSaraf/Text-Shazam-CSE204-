There is a bamboo tree 
that blooms only once in a hundred years
This is the year, your wedding year
And the bamboo blossoms just for you

For you the Columbine is blue
The paint brush flames upon the hills
For Allison and Denver John
A double sunrise lights the dawn

I've watched you blossom since you met
You've made a garden out of love
With splendid flowers and bowered paths
Where I am satisfied to walk

There was a thorn in Denver's side
That Allison has pruned and clipped
A sorrow Allison could hide
That Denver soothed and comforted

Each tending to the others need
Tears and smiles looked after now
The thorns and sorrows have their place
In proper balance, like the stars

You are both brave and beautiful
My brother, whom I've loved for life
And now a sister, newly mine
To love and treasure day and night

Home to the mountains, then, we come
To celebrate in unison
All peace, and pleasure, joy and bliss
To Denver John and Allison

Today for you the Columbine is blue
The paint brush flames upon the hills
For Allison and Denver John
A double sunrise lights the dawn
