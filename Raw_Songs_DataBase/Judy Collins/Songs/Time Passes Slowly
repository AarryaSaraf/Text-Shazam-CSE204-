Time passes slowly up here in the mountains
We sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains
And catch the wild fishes that swim in the streams
Time passes slow when you're lost in a dream

Once I had a sweetheart, he was fine and good lookin'
We sat in the kitchen while my mama was cookin'
And stared out the window to the stars high above
Time passes slow when you're searchin' for love

Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town
Ain't no reason to go to the fair
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down
Ain't no reason to go anywhere

Time passes slowly up here in the daylight
We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right
Like a cloud that passes and covers the day
Time passes slow and then fades away
