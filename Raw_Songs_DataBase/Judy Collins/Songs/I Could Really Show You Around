I could really show you around
I could bail you out of the lost and found
I can see you're big city bound
By the way you came off the Greyhound

I could really show you around
I could dress you up and then we could live it down
You could be surrounded by luxury
If you leave it up to me

After all
What have you got to lose
I've got it all
So how can you refuse
And after all
The things I'll do for you
And all you have to do
Is let me take you home

I could sweep you up in a flash
I'll make you forget that you're short of cash
Think of all the parties we'll crash
With all of the high class and all of the trash

I could really show you around
I could buy the brushes and we could paint the town
From the underground to the penthouse floor
'Cause my name can open doors

After all
What have I got to lose
You've got it all
And all I've got's the blues
After all
The things I'll do for you
And all you have to do
Is let me take you home

Calla lilies, cognac and Cadillacs
Caviar and coke and a charge at Sak's
Breakfast in my bed when you wake up at noon
Trips to the island, trips to the moon

I could really show you around
I could really show you around
I could really show you around
Let me show you around
Show you around
