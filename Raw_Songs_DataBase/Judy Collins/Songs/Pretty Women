Pretty women, fascinating
Sipping coffee, dancing
Pretty women are a wonder

Pretty women sitting in the window
Standing on the stair
Something in them cheers the air

Pretty women, silhouetted
Stay within' you, glancing
Stay forever, breathing lightly

Pretty women, pretty women
Blowing out their candles or combing out their hair
Even when they leave, they still are there

Pretty women in their gardens
How they make a man sing
Proof of heaven as you're living

Pretty women, pretty women
Blowing out their candles or combing out their hair
Even when they leave, they still are there, they're there

Ah, pretty women at their mirrors
How they make a man sing
Proof of heaven as you're living
Pretty women, pretty women, pretty women
