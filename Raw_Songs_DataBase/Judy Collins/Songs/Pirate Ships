Far away, far away, child
Turn your eyes far away, child
Mama will sleep right down beside you tonight
Mama will sleep tonight

Pirate ships, pirate ships, child
Merry and bold, sparkling and rich, child
Coming to dock right at your feet tonight
Coming to dock tonight

In the stars, in the stars, child
See the people in the stars, child
They will fly right through your window tonight
Into your window tonight

Mama will sleep right down beside you tonight
Mama will sleep tonight, far away
