Every mother has to let he child go
Even though it may tear her apart
I can hear the lullabies I sang you
Now you stand taller than my heart

You know you can bread my heart so easily
You can make my day with just a smile
One word from you can melt the winter snow
Make me forget the longest mile

Whatever you're doin' for the rest of your life
I'm here to tell you, you can count on me
No use my worryin', I know you can fly
I've gotta let you go, gotta set you free
I've gotta set you free

The road we walked was never easy
I know I stumbled on the way
I thought I knew what I was doing
When I was wrong you had to pay

I hope by now you can forgive me
And take the good I had to give
I was too young to be your teacher
We learned together how to live

Whatever you're doin' for the rest of your life
I'm here to tell you, you can count on me
No use my worryin', I know you can fly
I've gotta let you go, gotta set you free

I only hope you will be happy
I want the very best for you
The only prize that's worth the battle
Is finding love you know is true

Whatever you're doin' for the rest of your life
I'm here to tell you, you can count on me
No use my worryin', I know you can fly
I've gotta let you go, gotta set you free
