Hello! Hooray!
Let the show begin
I'm ready
Hello! Hooray!
Let the lights grow dim
We've been ready

Ready as the rain to fall, just to fall again
Ready as a man to be born, only to be born again, 
and again and again and again
Hello! Hooray! Let the show begin
I'm ready
Hello! Hooray! Let the lights grow dim
I'm been ready

Ready as the rain to fall, just to fall again
Ready as a man to be born, only to be born again,
I've been waiting so long for another song
I've been thinking so long I was the only one
We've been hoping so long for another song

So I will sit and I'm so thin
And I will laugh when this thing begins and begins,
And begins
It's then we'll be above the time and the weather
Dancing to a rolling good time on a feather
All it wants is coming here to stay
Each of them an actor, each one a play
I've been waiting so long for my song
I've been thinking so long I was the only one
We've were hoping so long for another song
So we will sit and we'll act so thin
And we will laugh when this thing begins and begins
