What did we do wrong?
We had all the magic to guide us on our way
And all the tragedy we could ever want to see
But you know I'm right
When I say the best is yet to come

Where did we go wrong?
Was it all so enlightening we couldn't find our way?
Was it all so frightening we couldn't see which move to make?
But you know I'm right
When I say the best is yet to come

And if you leave me now
As you say you might
Oh, please don't leave me now
'Cause I know, if you do
None of this will come true so

Where do we go now?
Now your heart is aching and leading you astray
And me, I'm shaking up, trying to get you to stay
But you know I'm right
When I say the best is yet to come
And you know the best is still to come
