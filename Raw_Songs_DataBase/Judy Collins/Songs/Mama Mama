Mama, Mama, you know how it feels
Love never knows a season
Mama, tell me you understand
The heart always has a reason

Doin' ninety-five in the middle of the night on an open road
Time for a good ol' girl like me to be bedded down
Gotta get home before the kids find out I've been away
I figure I'm gonna reach town just before dawn

I can see the sun is gonna be comin' up real soon
Hope the children don't wake up and wonder where I am
Gotta get the older ones to school and play with the baby
She's the apple of her mother's eye, and doesn't she know it

Don't know how it happened one more time
The money's running' out and the other kids are cryin'
Somebody tell me I'm not crazy
Doin' what I can to raise my babies

Mama, Mama, you know how it feels
Love never knows a season
Mama, tell me you understand
The heart always has a reason

Wonder if you know just how it feels to be alone
Tryin' to raise a bunch of kids on nothin' but love and guts
When the day is over I'm about as wrecked as a body can be
I got my troubles, but again I need me some kind of lovin'

Don't know how it happened one more time
The money's runnin' out and the other kids are cryin'
Somebody tell me I'm not crazy
Doin' what I can to raise my babies

Mama, Mama, you know how it feels
Love never knows a season
Mama, tell me you understand
The heart always has a reason

The doctor down in Lincoln said I'd be all right
He said he didn't want to help me but he'd do it just this once
Made me feel so bad I couldn't stop the tears from fallin'
Made me wish he had to pay this kind of price for his lovin'

Don't know how it happened one more time
The money's runnin' out and the other kids are cryin'
Five kids are gonna drive me crazy
Lord, I can't have another baby

Mama, Mama, you know how it feels
Love never knows a season
Mama, tell me you understand
The heart always has a reason
