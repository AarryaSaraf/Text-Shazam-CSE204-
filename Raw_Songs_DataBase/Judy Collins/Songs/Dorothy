Living in Kansas
A life alone
She never married
She's hardly known
She stares out the window far away
Looking for another windy day

Dorothy was a fool to leave
She could have stayed
She held it right in her hands
She had it made
She could have had it all for keeps
She was afraid
She could have stayed

It seems like only yesterday
But forty years have up and slipped away
Since a lovely black haired girl
Was taken from her one and only world

Dorothy was a fool to leave
She could have stayed
She held it right in her hands
She had it made
She could have had it all for keeps
But was afraid
She could have stayed

Same old bluebirds flying high
Over rainbows in the Kansas sky
Why oh why
Oh why

I guess it only serves her right
For trading all that color for black and white
All her sorrow
All because
There ain't no way to stand Kansas
When you've been to Oz

Dorothy was a fool to leave
She could have stayed
She held it right in her hands
She had it made
She could have had it all for keeps
But was afraid
She could have stayed
She could have stayed
She could have stayed
