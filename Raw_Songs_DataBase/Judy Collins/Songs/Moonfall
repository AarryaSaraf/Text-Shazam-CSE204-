Between the very dead of night and day
Upon a steely sheet of light I'll lay
And in the moonfall
I'll give myself to you
I'll bathe in moonfall
And dress myself in dew

Before the cloak of night reveals the morn
Time holds it's breathe while it conceals the dawn
And in the moonfall
All sound is frozen still
Yet warm against me

Your skin will warm the chill
Of moonfall
I feel it's fingers lingers the veil of night shade
Light made from stars that all too soon fall
Moonfall
That falls from you

Betwixed our hearts let nothing intervene
Between our eyes the only sight I've seen
Is lustrous moonfall as it blinds my view
So that soon I only see but you
