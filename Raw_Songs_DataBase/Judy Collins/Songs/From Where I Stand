From where I stand, I see the bridges burning
From where I stand, our love is going down
And it looks like stormy weather
My dreams have all gone home
We standing close together
And I'm feelin' all alone

I wonder when you knew you didn't need me
I wonder how it ever came to this
So far from where we started
To where we are today
I was standing in your shadow
Now I'm standing in your way

And I know I'll understand the reasons
I know I'll even bless the pain
But it's hard to watch the change of seasons
When hope is melting in the rain

So close your eyes, it isn't worth the crying
The sun will rise and dry your tears away
And oh, there's no hard feelings
I wish you all the best
Just leave behind your memory
And the devil take the rest

And I watch you turn and walk away
I find there's nothing left to say
I can't go back to yesterday
I'll never find the way
From where I stand
