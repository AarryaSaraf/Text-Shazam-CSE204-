Oh, father, come to the window, look over yonder lake
What a wondrous golden city beyond the icy wake
In my short life we've passed this way ten times or more
And never did a city rise up on that far shore

It's the sun, sun shining on the water
It's not far on New York or Rome
It's a matter of hours before you see your mama
Waitin' for you back at home

La, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la-la, la

Big buildings at its center stand ablaze with light
While other spires around these and trap the beams in flight
Oh, look now, I see people with faces small and fine
And in their midst just staring, a boy's face like mine

It's the sun, sun shining on the water
It's not far on New York or Rome
It's a matter of hours before you see your mama
Waitin' for you back at home

La, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la-la, la
La, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la-la, la

The sun was sinking, 'cause night was falling
The boy went after sleep
His wondrous city vanished into the icy deep
The moon was rising, 'cause night was falling
And now was as before
As we made our way through the countless pines
On the cold lake's northern shore

It's the sun, sun shining on the water
It's not far on New York or Rome
It's a matter of hours before you see your mama
Waitin' for you back at home

It's the sun, sun shining on the water
It's not far on New York or Rome
It's a matter of hours before you see your mama
Waitin' for you back at home

La, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la-la, la
La, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la...
