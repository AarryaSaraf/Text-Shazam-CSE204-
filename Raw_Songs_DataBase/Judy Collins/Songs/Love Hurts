Here I am at your door
Hoping you'll come back once more
And here I am and your love has died
It's one thing I wish you could hide

Love hurts when you know that it's gone
Love hurts when when you still love someone
Love hurts when there's nothing to do
But crty all the tears left inside you

I've heard it said that time brings relief
But hey just how long will it take
And here I am I feel like a fool
For causing this fool's heart to break

Love hurts when you know that it's gone
Love hurts when when you still love someone
Love hurts when there's nothing to do
But crty all the tears left inside you

How can I see you like seeing a friend
when each time I see you I break down again

Love hurts when there's nothing to do
But crty all the tears left inside you
Love hurts when you know that it's gone
Love hurts when when you still love someone
Love hurts when there's nothing to do
But crty all the tears left inside you
