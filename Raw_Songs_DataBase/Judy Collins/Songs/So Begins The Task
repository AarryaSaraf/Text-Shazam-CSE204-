Now begins the task
I have dreaded the coming of for so long
I wait for the sun
To remind my body it needs restin'

And I must learn to live without you now
As I cannot learn to give only part somehow

Camping on the edge of your city I wait
Hoping someday you might see beyond yourself

Shadows on the ceiling
Hard but not real
Like the bars that cage you within yourself

And I must learn to live without you now
As I cannot learn to give only part somehow

And I must learn to live without you now
As I cannot learn to give only part somehow

All of these cages
Must and shall be set aside
They will only keep us from the knowing

Actors and stages now fall before the truth
As the love shared between us remains growing

And I must learn to live without you now
As I cannot learn to give only part somehow

And I must learn to live without you now
As I cannot learn to give only part somehow
