Everything must change
Nothing remains the same
Everyone will change
No one, no one stays remains the same

The young become the old
And mysteries do unfold
'Cause that's the way of time
No one and nothing goes unchanged

There are not many things in life
One can be sure of
Except rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds fly

Winter turns to spring
A wounded heart will heal
But never much too soon
No one and nothing goes unchanged

The young become the old
And mysteries do unfold
'Cause that's the way of time
No one and nothing stays unchanged

There are not many things in life
One can be sure of
Except rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds can fly
Except rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds can fly
Rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds can fly

Everything must change
