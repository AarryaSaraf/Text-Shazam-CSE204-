Shule, shule, shule aroon
Shule the agaragar, shule the coon
Shule, shule, shule aroon
I blink up anyone, should tie me, oh

Here I sit on buttermilk hill
Weep I will and weep my fill
Every tear would turn a mill
Johnny is gone for a soldier

Shule, shule, shule aroon
Shule the agaragar, shule the coon
Shule, shule, shule aroon
I blink up anyone, should tie me, oh

I'll sell my flax, sell my meal
Sell my only spinnin' wheel
Buy my love, a sword of steel
Johnny's gone for a soldier

Shule, shule, shule aroon
Shule the agaragar, shule the coon
Shule, shule, shule aroon
I blink up anyone, should tie me, oh

Loved him, oh, I loved him so
Broke my heart to see him go
Only time can heal my woe
Johnny's gone for a soldier

Shule, shule, shule aroon
Shule the agaragar, shule the coon
Shule, shule, shule aroon
I blink up anyone, should tie me, oh

I sold my flax and my meal
Sold my only spinnin' wheel
Now he's dead upon the field
Johnny's gone for a soldier

Shule, shule, shule aroon
Shule the agaragar, shule the coon
Shule, shule, shule aroon
I blink up anyone, should tie me, oh
