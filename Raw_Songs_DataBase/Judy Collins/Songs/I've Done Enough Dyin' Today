What will we do now? You tell me
The hourglass is all out of sand
How could love slip through our fingers
And leave nothing but time on our hands?
And how will we live now? You tell me
With parts of our hearts torn away
Just existing makes dyin' look easy
But maybe tomorrow, I've done enough dying today

And how will I sleep now? You tell me
With only my arm by my side
Perhaps I'll learn sleeping all over
Or just maybe without dreaming this time
And who'll make you laugh now? You tell me
Since you've sent your clown on her way
I don't think I'll cry, just die laughing
But maybe tomorrow, I've done enough dying today

Just existing makes dying look easy
But maybe tomorrow, I've done enough dying today
