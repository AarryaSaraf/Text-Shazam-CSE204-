You picked me up when I was down
With pure and simple love you turned my life around
You gave to me a sense of worth
When I thought there was no mercy left upon the earth
And through your eyes I saw a brighter view
I couldn't help myself from falling in love with you

I was a restless man who never felt content
Until you came into my life and showed me what it meant
And only you knew what I was going through
I couldn't help myself from falling in love with you

They say you can't go home again
When you're just looking for what used to be
They say you can't go home again
But home is anyplace when you're with me

Sometime when I awake at dawn
I'm still afraid it's all a dream and you'll be gone
But I'll be here with you my whole life through
I couldn't help myself from falling in love with you

They say you can't go home again
When you're just looking for what used to be
They say you can't go home again
But home is anyplace when you're with me
But home is anyplace when you're with me

They say you can't go home again
When you're just looking for what used to be
They say you can't go home again
But home is anyplace when you're with me
