Speaking impartially, not at all personally
Just from a general point of view
Anyone would love you, anyone at all
Anyone with any sense is bound to fall

I'm sure that anyone whose heart is free
Meeting you, would say "Here's love at last"
"Here's every lonely dream come true"
Oh, anyone, believe me, would love you

I'm sure that anyone whose heart is free
Meeting you, would say "Here's love at last"
"Here's every lonely dream come true"
Oh, anyone, believe me, would love you
