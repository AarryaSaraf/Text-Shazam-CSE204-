Riding the night train, New York, to LA,
Gonna go and get me some sunshine.
Clipping along t'ward the Colorado Rockies,
Leaving you behind me.

There's a cold icy wind blowing like a demon
Off Lake Michigan.
I'm going where the weather is warm and the heat off.

You burned me out and you did me in,
You beat me at the game
I can not win.

I'm going where the pace is slower,
The stakes are lower.
I'm running for my life.

Tomorrow I'll wake up without you.
I'll curl my hair, and listen to my heart.
I don't want to hear a word about you,
I'll do what I care to do,
I'll do what I dare to do.
I'm running for my life.

I can see the switch man out in the freight yard,
Waving his lights at my train.
Red fir stopping my heart from beating,
Green for driving me insane.
And the rain is pouring,
And the wheels are rolling past that Nevada line
I'm going where the weather is hot,
And you are not.

I played the fool I believed your lies,
I danced till I was nearly paralyzed
I'm gone and going.
I'm running for my life

Tomorrow I'll wake up without you,
I'll get a room with windows on the sea
I'll do all the things I could never do,
You never will find me here
Not a thing to remind me here.
I'm running for my life

Sky's getting bright with California sunrise,
Shining its light on my train
Drying my tears soothing my fears,
Taking away my old pain.
And the engine's rockin' and the wheels are talkin'
About the tracks ahead,
I'm going where the world is new and the past is dead.
You brought me low and you got me high
I'm leaving you with my bridges burning,
There's no returning.

I'm running for my life
I'm running for me life
