I know where I'm going
I know who's going with me
I know who I love
And the devil knows who I'll marry

I have stockings of silk
Shoes of bright green leather
Combs to buckle my hair
And a ring for every finger

Feather beds are soft
Painted rooms are bonny
I would trade them all
For my handsome winsome Johnny

Some say he's bad
I say he's bonny
Fairest of them all
My handsome winsome Johnny

I know where I'm going
I know who's going with me
I know who I love
The devil knows who I'll marry
