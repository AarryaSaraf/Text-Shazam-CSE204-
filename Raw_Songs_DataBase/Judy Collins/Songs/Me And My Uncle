Me and my uncle went riding down
From Colorado, west Texas bound.
And we stopped off in Santa Fe.
It being the point, about half-way.
And besides it was the hottest part of the day.

We led our ponies into a stall.
Went to the bar boys,got drinks for all.
Two days in the saddle, my body hurt.
It being summer, took off my shirt,
And tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt.

West Texas cowboys, all over town.
With gold and silver, they're loaded down
Just in from round-up, it seemed a shame.
So my uncle starts a friendly game.
High-low Jacks and the winner takes the gains.

From the beginning uncle starts to win
Them Texas cowboys they was mad as sin
Some say he's cheating but that can't be.
'Cos my uncle he's honest as me.
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be.

One of them cowboys, he starts to draw,
I grabbed a bottle, slapped him on the jaw
I shot me another he won't grow old.
In the confusion, uncle grabbed the gold,
And we high-tailed it down to Mexico.

Now God bless cowboys and God bless gold.
God bless my uncle and rest his soul.
He taught me well boys, taught me all I know.
Taught me so well that I grabbed that gold,
And I left him lying there by the side of the road.
