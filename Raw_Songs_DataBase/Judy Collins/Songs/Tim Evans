Tim Evans was a prisoner within his prison cell
and those who read about his crime they damned his soul to hell
saying "go down you murderer, go down"

For the murder of his own dear wife and the killing of his child
the jury found him guilty and the hanging judge, he smiled
saying "go down you murderer, go down"

Tim Evans pleaded innocent and swore by Him on high
he never killed his own dear wife or caused his child to die
saying "go down you murderer, go down" 

They moved him out at 6 o'clock to his final flowery dell
and day and night two guards were there and never left his cell
saying "go down you murderer, go down" 

Sometimes they played cards with him - solo and pontoon
to stop him brooding on the rope that was to be his doom
saying go down you murderer, go down 

The governor came in one day with a chaplain by his side
said "your appeal has been turned down, prepare yourself to die"
saying "go down you murderer, go down" 

Tim Evans walked in the prison garden, the guards walked behind
he saw the sky above the wall and knew no peace of mind
saying "go down you murderer, go down" 

They fixed the rope around his neck, buckled behind his ears
the prison bell was tolling but Tim Evans did not hear
saying "go down you murderer, go down" 

A thousand men were cursing and banging on their doors
but Tim Evans did not hear them, he was deaf for evermore
saying "go down you murderer, go down" 

They sent Tim Evans to the drop for a crime he didn't do
It was Christie was the murderer, the judge and jury too
saying "go down you murderer, go down"
