Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses
You been out ridin' fences
For so long now
Oh, you're a hard one,
I know that you got your reasons
These things that are pleasin' you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy
She'll beat you if she's able
You know the queen of hearts
Is always your best bet
Now it seems to me some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones you can't get

Desperado
Oh you ain't gettin' no younger
Your pain and your hunger,
They're drivin' you home
And freedom, oh freedom,
Well that's just some people talkin'
Your prison is walkin'
Through this world all alone

Don't your feet get cold in the winter time
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away

Desperado
Why don't you come to your senses
Come down from your fences
And open the gate
It may be rainin'
But there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
(let somebody love you)
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late

You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late
