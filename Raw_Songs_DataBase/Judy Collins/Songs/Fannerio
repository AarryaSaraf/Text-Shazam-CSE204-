As we march down to Fannerio
As we march down to Fannerio
Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
And we called her by her name pretty Peggy O

What will your mother think pretty Peggy O?
What will your mother think pretty Peggy O?
What will your mother think but I hear the guineas clink?
And the soldiers marchin' behind you O

You shall ride in a coach pretty Peggy O
You shall ride in a coach pretty Peggy O
You shall ride in a coach with your true love by your side
As fine as any lady in the country O

And when I return pretty Peggy O
When I return pretty Peggy O
When I return, the city I will burn
And destroy all the ladies in the country O

Come trippin' down the stairs pretty Peggy O
Come trippin' down the stairs pretty Peggy O
Come trippin' down the stairs combin' back your yellow hair
Bid your last farewell to sweet William O

Sweet William he is dead pretty Peggy O
Sweet William is dead pretty Peggy O
Sweet William is dead and he died for a maid
He's buried in the Louisiana country O

As we march down to Fannerio
As we march down to Fannerio
Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
And we called her by her name pretty Peggy O
