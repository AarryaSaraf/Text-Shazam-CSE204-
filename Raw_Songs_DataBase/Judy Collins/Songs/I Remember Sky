I remember sky
It was blue as ink
Or at least I think
I remember sky

I remember snow
Soft as feathers
Sharp as thumb tacks
Coming down like lint
And it made you squint
When the wind would blow

And ice like vinyl on the streets
Cold as silver, white as sheets
Rain like strings and changing things
Like leaves

I remember leaves green as spearmint
Crisp as paper
I remember trees bare as coat racks
Spread like broken umbrellas

And parks and bridges, ponds and zoos
Ruddy faces, muddy shoes
And light and noise and bees and boys
And days

I remember days or at least I try
But as years go by
They're a sort of haze

And the bluest ink isn't really sky
And at times I think
I would gladly die
For a day of sky
