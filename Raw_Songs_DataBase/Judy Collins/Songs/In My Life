There are places, I remember,
all my life though some have changed
some forever, not for better
some are gone, and some remain
all these places have their meanings
with lovers and friends I still can recall, 
some are dead and some are living...
in my life, I've loved them all.

But of all these friends and lovers, 
there is no one compares with you. 
And these memories lose their meaning 
when I think of love of something new. 
Though I know I'll never lose affection for people 
and things that went before, 
I know I'll often stop and think about them.
In my life, I love you more.

Though I know I'll never lose affection for people 
and things that went before, 
I know I'll often stop and think about them. 
In my life, I love you more.
