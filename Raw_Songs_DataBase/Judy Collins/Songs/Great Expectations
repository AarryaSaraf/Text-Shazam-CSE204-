So say goodbye and turn around
You're set free and I let down
Down is never been a place I care to stay
So babe I am as good has gone
I never care it taught us long
For ever it's tonight for tomorrow
So they say is a brand new day

And I have great expectations of love again in my life
They'll be great celebrations of love again in my life
I believe in beginning again
I expect to be winning again
I intend to have love in my life

One million chances on the street
On every corner glances meet
Somewhere in this city perfect strangers wait

Strangers wait for a destiny
And one or several wait for me
And somewhere in this city love will take me by surprise
And I will fall or I may rise

I have great expectations of love again in my life
They'll be great celebrations of love again in my life
I believe in beginning again
I expect to be winning again
I intend to have love in my life
