Welcome to the apocalypse, the end of days
Rulers of the wasteland, rejoice in the flames
Futures tumble, legacies crumble
Thousands of years and what have we learned?

They heard the warnings, ignored the signs
Wheels of injustice kept on turning
Unaccountable for their crimes
On the streets anger burning

Black clouds rumble, dark days ahead
As the chorus chants for a holy war

"It's the end of an era, a new dawn will rise"

Words turned to war, brother fighting brother
Another false truce, as the people die
The fate of the nation forever changed
Behold - the fiery end is nigh
Behind closed doors, corruption wins
The power echelon prepares their task
One step forward, two stabs in the back
Revolution is a mere change of masks?

Black clouds rumble, dark days ahead
As the chorus chants for a holy war

"It's the end of an era, a new dawn will rise"

We rise again from the stench and the pain
We pass through fire, darkness erase the stain

Black clouds rumble, dark days ahead
As the chorus chants for a holy war

"It's the end of an era, a new dawn will rise"
"It's the end of an era, a new dawn"

As the sun sets on the empire
Is there a future to be found?
Hopes and dreams... now ashes on the ground
