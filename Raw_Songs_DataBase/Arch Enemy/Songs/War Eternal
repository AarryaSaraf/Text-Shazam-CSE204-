Friend or foe?
There's no way to know
In the battlefield of life
It's kill or be killed
So many times
It's a matter of degrees
From being up on your luck
To down on your knees

It's a hellish inferno
This is war eternal

They try to change you
Crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They love to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are

It's times like these
When lines are drawn
Which side of the fence
Are you standing on?
There will come a day
Not so far away
When the hunter
Becomes the prey
(and you will pay)

It's a hellish inferno
This is war eternal

They try to change you
Crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They love to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are

This is fucking war!

They try to change you
Crush and break you
Try to tell you what to do
They love to have control of you
Back against the wall
In danger of losing it all
Search deep inside
Remember who you are
