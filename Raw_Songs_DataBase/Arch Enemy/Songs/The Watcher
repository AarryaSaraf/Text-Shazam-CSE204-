Born to a flock of animosity
To be judged, to be shamed, no rights and no dignity
Beneath the eye of disdain
Where the watcher sees the wicked, we compel

Offspring of divine regret
Condemn thy daughters of death
Gripping the face of the earth
Return to dirt
Under the eye

Don't fear the watcher, sentinel from the skies above
The rebel angel sees through all of us
Beware the watcher, the earth is erased in flood
The rebel angel laughs and falls at last

Does the observer make reality?
Does the gaze activate quantum complicity?
Beneath the pyre and pain
Where we jettison body and brain!

Offspring of divine regret
Condemn thy daughters of death
Gripping the face of the earth
Return to dirt
Under the eye

Don't fear the watcher, sentinel from the skies above
The rebel angel sees through all of us
Beware the watcher, the earth is erased in flood
The rebel angel laughs and falls at last
At last

Writhing with the Nephilim
Behold fire and flood!

Offspring of divine regret
Condemn thy daughters of death
Gripping the face of the earth
Return to dirt
Under the eye

Don't fear the watcher, sentinel from the skies above
The rebel angel sees through all of us
Beware the watcher, the earth is erased in flood
The rebel angel laughs and falls at last
At last
