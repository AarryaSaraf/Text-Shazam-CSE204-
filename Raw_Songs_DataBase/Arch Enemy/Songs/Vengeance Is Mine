Infestation
Of spirit and flesh

Indignation
Is all you left me with

Domination
Your ultimate goal

Transmigration
You will lose control



I will rise up and prove you wrong
I have been waiting in the shadows for too long



The gates are opening - My true self unleashed



Laceration
Of my mind and soul

Alteration
Your truth is full of lies

Liberation
Sweet revenge is mine

Devastation
You will burn in my hell



I will rise up and prove you wrong
I have been waiting in the shadows for too long



The gates are opening - My true self unleashed

Vengeance is mine!





The gates are opening - My true self unleashed
