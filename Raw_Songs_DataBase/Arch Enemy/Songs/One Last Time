Life's been a losing game, every day the same
An impossible dream, a cog in the machine
If I don't make it now, don't think I ever will
So, what now?

Frustration
Stagnation
Don't dream too big, you might hurt yourself
Just stay in line

Determination
Ooh, confrontation
I'm on my way
Heading into the unknown

Patience is running out
It's wearing thin
Feels like I'm slipping
Losing ground

I'm gonna break free
Get out of these chains
I've got nothing to lose
And everything to gain
The future is calling
It's calling out my name
One last time

Running out of breath, on this spinning wheel
Make it real, all will be revealed
Too many missing pieces to this puzzle
I've played their game, but it's not who I am
No

Frustration
Stagnation
Don't dream too big, you might hurt yourself
Just stay in line

Determination
Ooh, confrontation
I'm on my way
Heading into the unknown

Patience is running out
It's wearing thin
Feels like I'm slipping
Losing ground

I'm gonna break free
Get out of these chains
I've got nothing to lose
And everything to gain
The future is calling
It's calling out my name
One last time

I'm gonna break free
Get out of these chains
I've got nothing to lose
And everything to gain
The future is calling
It's calling out my name
One last time
