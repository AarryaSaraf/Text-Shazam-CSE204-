The light dwindles down to nothing
As the candle sputters out
Just beyond the abb and flow
Of a dark and restless heart

Alone again
Facing the demons
In this hell
Of my own making

I will not let this moment
Define who I am
Now you see me
Now you don't
I am strong, eternal
Now you see me
Now you don't

Licking the wounds now
I shelter in the melody
My ink runs from black to red
Screaming into the void

Alone again
Facing the demons
In this hell
Of my own making

I will not let this moment
Define who I am
Now you see me
Now you don't
I am strong, eternal
Now you see me
Now you don't

Seemingly endless
Like the wind, the stormy seas
I held the poison, I had the power
I will return

Seemingly endless
Like the wind, the stormy seas
I held the poison, I had the power
I will return
