(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Cast from heaven, now to rule in hell
A cry for freedom in a long lost tale
Darkness is all around me
Or is it all within me?
Tired of living on my knees
Can I be set free, be the real me?
I can't breathe, I can't see
I can't touch, I can't feel

Oh, morning star
Son of the dawn
Fallen from grace
Do not fear to tread
The left-hand path
I am here
Spreading black wings

(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Opened my eyes, saw the divine lies
The power lies within me
Not in worship of idols
I am my own authority
Break the chains of past
Sweet freedom at last
I can breathe, I can see
I can touch, I can feel!

Oh, morning star
Son of the dawn
Fallen from grace
Do not fear to tread
The left-hand path
I am here
Spreading black wings
