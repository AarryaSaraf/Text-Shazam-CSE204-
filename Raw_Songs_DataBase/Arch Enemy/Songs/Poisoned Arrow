Silent shadows, a broken frame
The empty picture that we became
No words needed, the stories in our eyes
A crack in the mirror, too many lies

Deep footsteps mark the snow
Traces of yesterday, where and when to go
We never meant to cause pain nor sorrow
Now every word a poisoned arrow

Is it worth fighting for?
Or even dying for?
Broken, yet unspoken
The feeling is gone

Hostile words and heavy hearts
This is where our paths drift apart
No more anger, no more sadness
Turn the page, another poisoned arrow

Is it worth fighting for?
Or even dying for?
Broken, yet unspoken
The feeling is gone

Is it worth fighting for?
Is it worth dying for?
The feeling is gone

(Is it worth fighting for?)
(Is it worth dying for?)

Is it worth fighting for?
Or even dying for?
Broken, yet unspoken
The feeling is gone

Is it worth fighting for?
(No)
Is it worth dying for?
The feeling is gone
