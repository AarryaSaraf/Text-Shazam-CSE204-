// The Immortal //

This liquid vision of euphoria
Living a life on borrowed time
Paying the price of immortality
Desperately avoiding our fate
Lead me through the halls of tortured souls
Alone, forlorn, human dignity dethroned
Forevermore, a life never-ending
Time stands still as the Immortals keep on breeding

The future is locked within us
All we need is the key
Crying at the fountain of youth
Eternal life is killing me

Triumphant in chariots they ride
On this arena of the undead
Another lap of honor
For the vacant galleries
Lead me through the halls of tortured souls
Alone, forlorn, human dignity dethroned
Forevermore, a life never-ending
Time stands still as the Immortals keep on breeding

The future is locked within us
All we need is the key
Crying at the fountain of youth
Eternal life is killing me

The future is locked within us
All we need is the key
Crying at the fountain of youth
Eternal life is killing me

// Dead Inside //

Spiritual Isolation; the ultimate frustration
Scratch the surface, turn another page
The ugly truth or another pretty lie?
You deceived me, I believed you
Why did everything go...

So wrong
For so long?
So the truth comes out at last
So wrong
For so long
So the truth comes out at last

I'm dead inside
A hollow shell
In my own misery
You leave me to dwell
I'm burning up
My private hell
In my own misery
You leave me to dwell

Then we were young and strong
Now everything is wrong
Did you want me, did you need me
Could you not say you believed me?
Everything we had is gone
Like an old forgotten song
The deceiver and believer
Now everything is...

So wrong
For so long
So the truth comes out at last
So wrong
For so long
So the truth comes out at last

I'm dead inside
A hollow shell
In my own misery
You leave me to dwell
I'm burning up
My private hell
In my own misery
You leave me to dwell

So wrong
For so long

// Pilgrim //

From the womb
To the tomb
An eternal struggle for the holy truth
We are not the first
Nor shall we be the last
We shall be followed by thousands more
Study the scriptures
Intensify the faith
The works of men much greater than you or I
From the cradle
To the grave
Thousands of immoral souls just waiting to be saved

Pilgrim man, what are you searching for?
Believe the tales when everything else fails
Pilgrim man, deep in your heart you know
Your faith is already bought and sold

All my life
I served the cross
Always believing my God was a just one
I maimed for you
I killed for you
But looking back at my life
I just don't know anymore

Pilgrim man, what are you searching for?
Believe the tales when everything else fails
Pilgrim man, deep in your heart you know
Your faith is already bought and sold

Pilgrim man, what are you searching for?
Believe the tales when everything else fails
Pilgrim man, deep in your heart you know
Your faith is already bought and sold

// Silverwing //

Fly with me on a starlit sky
I'll set you free... Yes, it can be
A dream unchased is a life at waste
Never let them conquer your pride

Our love is warm here
Like the image of a distant sun
This star will always shine
And never, ever fade away

Fly on
Silverwing
Fly with me
Stay free
Silverwing

Seeking truths in spirit skies
Which one of you will guide me tonight?
The milky way tastes sour
Has heaven lost its power?

So let us set sail on this sea of dreams
The moon gets lost in the morning sun
Just let the spinning wheel spin
And let your life begin

Fly on
Silverwing
Fly with me
Stay free
Silverwing

// Demonic Science //

The human blood is far too thin
The life in it much too fragile
DNA code twisted into form
An ancient dream will now be reborn

Demonic! Science!
A high price for a passion so intense
Demonic! Science!
This world no longer makes any sense

Save the best - strip away the rest
Every weakness, every bleakness will be erased
New flesh for a new world!
Men in white clothes performing the ultimate test

This is the era - this is the time
A new dawn arrives...

// Seed Of Hate //

The shape of all my doubts... My fear
Come closer... Trust me

Here I stand in the falling rain
There is no joy inside these tears
I see the world through a twisted and bitter stare
To be where I have been... to see what I have seen

Is it a dream?
Or can I believe...
The memories will haunt me for evermore

The shape of all my doubts... My fear
Come closer... I trusted you

I am not the man you used to know
I am different... Everything is different now
When you left me, you planted a seed of hate in me
Nothing is stronger... Stronger than this

// Angelclaw //

Angelclaw - A queen of the night
She reigns from her throne of stone
Bringer of evil, a destroyer of souls
Do what thou wilt, lust is her excuse

She'll use you up, suck you dry
This beautiful creature makes you high
Try to break the spell that is cast
But she knows you all to well

Angelclaw...

Effigy of a God long forgotten
A sickening ritual
She raises the chalice of blood
The hunt starts again...

// Burning Bridges //

So now the bridges are burnt
A lesson learned?
Promises broken
Tender lies softly spoken
Changes in you
Changes in me
Maybe it was never meant to be

It wasn't you
It wasn't me
We were far too close to see
