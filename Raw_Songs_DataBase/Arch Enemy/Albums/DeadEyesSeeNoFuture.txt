Album: DeadEyesSeeNoFuture

// Dead Eyes See No Future //

Giving our blood
To the doomsday machine
Fighting for ravaged land
A worthless gain
Marching on a dead end road

A violent new disorder
Feeding off mistrust
Forgot what we were fighting for
A worthless aim
A victory stinking of despair

Dead eyes
See no future
Falling from grace
We are coming home

Battalions of hate
Seeking shelter in hell
Bloodstained memories
Will we ever be forgiven
Our twisted fate
Time will tell

// Burning Angel (Live) //

Dark shadows from above
Ravens fly, obliterate the sun
"It's a sign of the devil.
He will come for his servant tonight"
These are dark times
Suspicious minds breed like rats
Guardians of corrupt morality
Spread their filthy lies

Am I to burn
I have not sinned!
Burnt at the stake.
Innocent blood that can never be washed clean

The flames of ignorance
Grow higher and higher
Licking my flesh - burning my soul
The raven laughing in the moon

These are dark times
Suspicious minds breed like rats.
Guardians of corrupt morality
Spread their filthy lies again...

// We Will Rise (Live) //

Tear down the walls
Wake up the world
Ignorance is not bliss
So fed up with second best
Our time is here and now

I am the enemy
I am the antidote
Watch me closely
I will stand up - now

We will rise
Rise above

Stereotype Fools
Playing the game
Nothing unique
They all look the same
In this sea of mediocrity
I can be anything
Anything I want to be

We will rise
