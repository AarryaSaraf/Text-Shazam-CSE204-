// Scream Of Anger //

I won't live to see tomorrow
There won't be another breath
None of them will ever sorrow
Those who sentenced me to death

I've been waiting here for ages
For the hangman to appear
Soon the priest will read some pages
From the Bible for my fear

I see a place an evil place
Comin' my way
What can I do where can I run
I'm gonna die anyway
Things are getting clearer
This is the price I have to pay

I feel like screaming out my anger
There is so much left here to do
When it happened I was younger
And my destiny was you

I see a place an evil place...

What can I do
About leaving you
We were only halfway through
What can I say
There was no other way
They wouldn't let me stay

// Starbreaker //

Look out, here's Starbreaker
Cruisin' into town
Set his mind to stealin'
Every little heart around
Step out on the sidewalks
If you're feeling game
He comes but once a lifetime
Never seen again

Starbreaker
Glides in from the sky
Starbreaker
Takes you up so high

Paradise is waiting
For the chosen few
Let's hope maybe this time
He picks me and you
Star voyage to a new world
Light-year miles away
Cross your fingers, here he is,
Take us now this day

Starbreaker
Glides in from the sky
Starbreaker
Takes you up so high

Starbreaker, take my hand
Starbreaker, understand
Starbreaker, you're the one
Starbreaker, lead us on, and on

Look out, here's Starbreaker
Cruisin' into town
Set his mind to stealin'
Every little heart around
Step out on the sidewalks
If you're feeling game
He comes but once a lifetime
Never ever seen again

Starbreaker
Glides in from the sky
Starbreaker
Takes you up so high

// Aces High //

There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack.

Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheel blocks there's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Gotta get airborne before its too late.

Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Run, live to fly, fly to live. aces high.

Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round and come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again.

Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten me-109s out of the sun
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns

Rolling, turning, diving
Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high.

// Symphony Of Destruction //

You take a mortal man,
And put him in control
Watch him become a god
Watch peoples heads a'roll
A'roll...

[Chorus:]
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony ...
Of Destruction

Acting like a robot
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head explodes
Explodes...

[Chorus]

[Solo - Marty]

The earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
A'warring for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
Tall...

[Chorus]

// Kill With Power //

Hear what's written on the wind.
We come to kill and kill again.
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead-Ride through the
Gate of clouds-stand on the open step

Run berserk-spreading fear and pain
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.
None can harm us-not their fire-
Iron or steel-for we have the
Will to power-with power we will
Kill

Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die

To the war god Odin you will pray
And the curse of weapons shell
Remain.On the blood of all our
Fathers-on their weapons we now
Swear to evenge-not lament.
Give the False ones death.

Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die

// Incarnated Solvent Abuse //

Intenacious, intersecting
Reaving fats from corporal griskin
Culled...for sodden gelatine brayed
Skeletal groats triturated, desinently
Exsiccated, sere glutenate brewed
For frivolous solvent abuse...

Derogate coarse remains
For glue to dry
Despoiled marrow razed

...A truculent shambles so severe...

Extravated bone - as adhesive incarnate
A pellucid quietus - nocuosly I create

Corporal glue, breathe in the fumes
Mucilage vapours, toxic fumes to savour

[Lead: Glue stiffing by W.G. Steer]

Comminuted remains
As gum to dry
A lissom gel so glazed

...A truculent shambolic affair...

The exsanguine esprit - shorted as snuff
Rheumic oils forever - Bonded together as gum

Human glue, choke on the fumes
Noxious vapours, slaughterous labour...

[Lead: Viscous residue snorting by M. Amott]

// Walk In The Shadows //

What? You say you're through with me
I'm not through with you
We've had what others might call love
You say it's over now,
What's done, what's through?
You can't stay away, you need me
I need you

When the fire starts the pain's too much
For your mind
You need attention, what's good is only mine
I can cure the hunger that burns in your heart
Just come to me
I'll take you home
We'll walk in the shadows
By day we'll live in a dream
We'll walk in the shadows

You say you don't feel safe alone tonight
Cause you feel the pressure building in your head
Our secret's safe for one more night
But when the morning comes remember
I'll be with you

We'll walk in the shadows
By day we'll live in a dream
We'll walk in the shadows
One day you'll be with me
If only you believe...

// The Oath //

Like a blade of a sword I am forged in flames
Fiery hot
Tempered steel fire-bright to the night I take
I fear not

Now compelled by something I cannot see
I go forth surrendering to history

Your glory, I swear I'll ride for thee
Your power, I trust it rides with me
Your servant I am and ever shall I be

Through a dream I have a come to an ancient door
Lost in the mist
I have been there a hundred times or more
Pounding my fists

Now inside, the fire of the ancient burns
A boy goes in and suddenly a man returns

Your glory, I swear I'll ride for thee
Your power, I trust it rides with me
Your servant I am and ever shall I be

I gave my word and gained a key
I gave my heart and set it free
There's no turning back from this odyssey
'Cause I feel so alive suddenly
And I wonder, is this really me?

Like a blade of a sword I am forged in flames
Fiery hot
Tempered steel fire-bright to the night I take
I fear not

Now compelled by something I cannot see
I go forth surrendering to history

Your glory, I swear I'll ride for thee
Your power, I trust it rides with me
Your servant I am and ever shall I be

// The Zoo //

The job is done and I go out
Another boring day
I leave it all behind me now
So many worlds away

I meet my girl, she's dressed to kill
And all we gonna do
Is walk around to catch the thrill
On streets we call the zoo

[Chorus:]
We eat the night, we drink the time
Make our dreams come true
And hungry eyes are passing by
On streets we call the zoo

Enjoy the zoo
And walk down 42nd Street
You Gonna be excited too
And you will feel the heat

[Chorus x2]

// Shadow On The Wall //

Treat me like a prisoner
Treat me like a fool
Treat me like a loser
Use me as a tool
Face me 'til I'm hungry
Push me in the cold
Treat me like a criminal
Just a shadow on the wall

Shadow on the wall [x4]
Like a shadow on the wall

Treat me like I'm evil
Freeze me 'til I'm cold
Beat me 'til I'm feeble
Grab me 'til I'm old
Fry me 'til I'm tired
Push me 'til I fall
Treat me like a criminal
Just a shadow on the wall

Shadow on the wall [x4]
Like a shadow on the wall

Shadow on the wall [x8]

// Breaking The Law //

There I was completely wasting
Out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating
As I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares
If I live or die
So I might as well begin
To put some action in my life

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

So much for the golden future
I can't even start
I've had every promise broken
And there's anger in my heart
You don't know what it's like
You don't have a clue
If you did you'd find yourselves
Doing the same thing too

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

You don't know what it's like

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

// Shout //

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm talking to you
Come on

Yeah!

In violent times
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white
They really, really ought to know
Those one-track minds
That took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
You shouldn't have to jump for joy

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm talking to you
Come on

They gave you life
And in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to tell the tale

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
So come on, I'm talking to you
So come on

And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart
I'd really love to break your heart

Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm talking to you
Come on

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm talking to you
Come on

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm talking to you
So come on

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
(Let it all out) I'm talking to you
Come on
So come on

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm talking to you
So come on

// Back To Back //

Ride

They came at dawn into the morning light
Black shadows ridin' on the mist
Prepared for battle swords were shinin' bright
Filled with anger and harm
Came to kill not to charm

The sound of metal screamin' in the air
The time has come where justice rules
The endless victims looking up in fear
Now who were the fools

Oh here they come
Riders of the sun
And they will fight
Back to back
Back to back

They're fighting hard their way of victory
Dead bodies lying on the ground
They are the soldiers of eternity
And their swords spinnin' around

Oh here they come
Riders of the sun
And they will fight
Back to back
Back to back

They're fightin' with power
Ready to ride
Let go

They got it all
They'll never fall
But they will fight

The night is fallin', light will disappear
A magic silence fills the place
Could read the warning shinin' crystal clear
Now they were lost for the chase

Oh here they come
Riders of the sun
And they will fight
Back to back
Back to back

No no no no

// City Baby Attacked By Rats //

The memory lingers on when you were the same as us
Three months old a child, still you lived off love and fuss

City baby, city baby, city baby attacked by rats
City baby, city baby, city baby attacked by rats

Residing in a squalid place, it can't be too much fun
Your brain is getting eaten away by the rat living in your skull

City baby, city baby, city baby attacked by rats
City baby, city baby, city baby attacked by rats

A mutant at the age of one, a human rodent cabbage
It's hard to think a tiny thing can do that much damage

City baby, city baby, city baby attacked by rats
City baby, city baby, city baby attacked by rats

The memory lingers on when you were the same as us
Three months old a child, still you lived off love and fuss

City baby, city baby, city baby attacked by rats
City baby, city baby, city baby attacked by rats

// Wings Of Tomorrow //

You must be dreamin'
Or going out of your mind
There's no way of changin'
The world over one night

Baby you need to recover
From all the things you've been through
Baby you need to discover
There ain't much to do but

Ride, ride, ride
The wings of tomorrow
Ride, ride, ride
To change the world

You feel sorry for the nations of 1984
And it cuts you like a razor
Cause you've seen it all before

You've seen one war after another
So many lives on the line
You must take care of one another
Or reach the end of time

Ride, ride, ride
The wings of tomorrow
Ride, ride, ride
To change the world
To change the world

You must be dreamin'
Or going out of your mind
There's no way of changin'
The world over one night

Baby you need to recover
From all the things you've been through
Baby you need to discover
There ain't much to do but

Ride, ride, ride
The wings of tomorrow
Ride, ride, ride
To change the world

Ride, ride, ride
The wings of tomorrow
Ride, ride, ride
To change the world

// The Book Of Heavy Metal //

I'd sign a contract with the devil
I've tried for so very long
I'd die to become immortal
That's why I sing this song
Am I a wannabe? Have I no dignity?
Who'd give up all my life to be
In the book of heavy metal
In the book of heavy metal

In life, I have no religion
Besides the heavy metal gods
Wear nothing but black skin tight leather
My skin is clad with metal studs
Am I a wannabe? Have I no dignity?
I give up all my life to be
In the book of heavy metal
In the book of heavy metal

Some twenty years ago, the gods put down their feet
So firmly in to the ground that no man of sword nor pen
Could ever change the rules upon which
The very fundament of metal was made

Read all about it, in the book of heavy metal
Read all about it, in the manual
Read all about it, in the book of heavy metal
Read all about it, yes, read it!

Don't need no flashy house, no kids or ugly wife
The only thing I want is what my parents daunt
Need no widescreen TV
No, in all honesty
The only thing I want to be (to be or not to be)

In the book of heavy metal

I've signed a contract with the devil
In the book of heavy metal

I'd like to become a star
In the book of heavy metal

I'd die to become immortal
In the book of heavy metal

That's why I play the guitar
In the book of heavy metal

In the book of heavy metal
In the book of heavy metal
In the book of heavy metal
