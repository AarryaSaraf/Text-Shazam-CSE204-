// Fitted Cap //

Beat billionaire

[Rick Ross]
You know I stick to the script
Twenty-million dollar nigga, but I do it like this

(M-M-M-Maybach Music, Maybach Music)

[Rick Ross - Chorus]
My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap (Wuh!)
My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap (Wuh!)
My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap
My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap
The Rolls-Royce, it's all white
Foamposites, the LeBrons, I'm fuckin' wit' the Spikes

My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap (Woo!)
My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap (Woo!)
The Rolls-Royce, it's all white (How can I not talk big? I got to)

Wale

[Wale - Verse 1]
Yeah, uh
Ferrari mics, bitch, I'm on my car show
My chick black and white, she ain't no dime, that bitch a Concorde
11 know I'm reppin' this, shoot and I don't ever miss
The coupe I'm in is rented, I ain't wit' all that commitment shit
P-R-Ps is proper, couple Gs when I'm shoppin'
My girls and my SBs, got a thing for pink boxes
Shout out Frankie the Butcher, shout out Mishka in Brooklyn
That's some nigga from 10.deep ATL, I'm wit' the cooker
I ain't e'en tryin', fool, ho, I ball like private school
You bammas like Hyperstrikes, your wifey sleep outside of you
And Tito's my niggas, you know just we just need more shit and
It's ironic how I drop some dough when I got them Homer Simpsons, look
Pine-green Foams, they may never see the store
Got LeBron Entourages like Maverick and Richie Paul
Bitch, I ball, ho, you lame, look at my Laneys, switchin' lanes
Look at my 9s, look at my Blazers, look at my 4s, cut wit' laser
Look at my whore, that is your lady, look at my flo', makin' y'all crazy
Makin' y'all sick, y'all cannot tame me, Lexus drive me, Maybach pay me
Salute

[Rick Ross - Chorus]
My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap (Woo!)
My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap (Woo!)
The Rolls-Royce (Huh!), it's all white (Huh!)
Foamposites, the LeBrons, I'm fuckin' wit' the Spikes
Meek Mill

[Meek Mill]
Yo
I said I'm swaggin' out in my Cool Greys, no LL, but these cool Js
And my wrist froze, but I'm cool sha', like a bald head, I'm too paid
I'm too blazed, and I'm too high, George Kush, the whole crew high
Wrong move and that tool fly, better Kon that ass like Wu-sai
It's MMG, MOB, young nigga, I been OG
Walk around wit' like 10 on me, that 5-7, that fen' on me
Don't grin on me wit' them long stares, you ain't God unless no fear
Big money, all the hoes, HD, I came so clear
We jeweled out and we racked up, Phantom big when it back up
Big Boy, look like a Mack truck, shooters ride wit' that Mac tucked
I'm a Bad Boy, bitch, ask Puff, Simpson-Rodgers, my last cup
On this shit, I can't stand up, country Ks as I man up
This Rozay, Wale, Gunplay, and that nigga Pill
In Brazil, and this shit is real, got bad hoes and that whippet pill
One week and we get the deal, one day and I fucked the bitch
My Levis, they 501, my snapback is hella bent

My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap (Woo!)
My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap (Woo!)
The Rolls-Royce (Huh!), it's all white (Huh!)
Foamposites, the LeBrons, I'm fuckin' wit' the Spikes

[J. Cole]
Fresh-ass nigga, no wonder why them hoes be open
That's that nigga, so what'd I say? They okey-dokin'
How you figga? You fuckin' wit' me? I hope he jokin'
I'm witcha girl, you home alone, bitch you Macauley Culkin
I'm oviedosin', ay, homie, Kobe smokin'
Then put my ashes on you niggas, bet you gon' need lotion
I'm slowly roastin', heatin' up, so you know we toastin'
Fuck hoes wit' no emotion, fade away like Kobe postin'
Out in Sweden, like ain't shit that you can't tell us
Lord, forgive me, as a kid, I used to look at niggas jealous
'Cause uh, they had them Js, and my mama wouldn't cop 'em
Can you blame her? Hundred dollars for them bitches wann't a option
Now we livin' much better, nigga, pay whatever
Rock them bitches once then forgot about 'em forever
My kicks like my chick, I don't need to know the numbers
You just need to know I'm comin', I'll kill you niggas this summer
Cole

My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap
My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap

Foamposites, the LeBrons, I'm fuckin' wit' the Spikes

My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap (Woo!)
My Jordans high-top, snapback fitted cap (Woo!)
The Rolls-Royce (Huh!), it's all white (Huh!)

M-M-M-Maybach Music

// See It To Believe It //

The songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Finally give a nigga leg room and a whip

Yeah Cole World, make way for the chosen one
Ain't nobody else I'd rather be, not even Oprah's son
Momma's youngest getting paper like the oldest one
We living better guess God felt he owed us one
Closets barely had no clothes in them
So you throw my niggas in hoopty', but we still bag hoes and them
These niggas give they heart and soul to them
I wonder if they know we doving them
Ass fat so when pinch 'em (pincher) like a Doberman
Run up on em politicing like Keith Olbermann
What's your name? Where ya from?
Ya got a dream? I'll sell ya one
Come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top
Won't stop, won't stop
Hey and don't stop
Now if it don't jam the hoes wont rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends wont cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don't got

Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it

and don't stop
Now if it don't jam the hoes wont rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends wont cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don't got

Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it

There's so much pain on my brain I gotta jot it out
But as of late nigga, it ain't been shit to pout about
I turn up the news, my blues seem petty
Cause my view of the city is incredible with no album out
I'm blessed nigga, I'm blessed
When I'm all alone these words just flow out of my chest
Turn 'em into poems, they worship, I'm the best
And though I'm taking long, they fuck with me none the less
Yeah, enough sleeping, I put you niggas to rest
The only one saying shit is like a nigga got tourettes, (chyeah)
Unimpressed with you niggas
You the shit only cause I digested you niggas
But I digress, boy you bout as G as a fucking tie dye vest
And your wifey is a bird even in her Prada dress
Want a nigga like me to come and get her out her nest (out her nest)
Like come and kick it with a nigga on his way to the top

Won't stop, won't stop
Hey, don't stop

Now if it don't jam the hoes wont rock
And if it ain't crack then the fiends wont cop
And you wonder why a nigga got the shit you don't got

Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it
Gotta see it to believe it

// Disgusting //

Can't help but think about it all the time.
And you know what's on my mind [x4]
Can't help but think about it all the time.
And you know what's on my mind [x4]

I told them recognize , Smith and Wesson.

Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
What is you discussing?

Hey, Oh NO
Not another line about how life's a bitch
Well fuck the world and enjoy it
If she is, wonder can she ride the dick.
If so I take her on a voyage
I like em long legged, Mega Thick
Work it out Ya know employ it
You wanna know how I know I'm the shit
Cuz I keep clogging up the toilet

Coley Cole, Fresh as a Four week old
Not a scratch on me, Hoes ask for me
Niggas ask bout me, Silly if you doubt me
Close your eyes and see where the game is headed without me
Give you the realest nigga, give you the chills
You looking at the reason the label gave you the deal
You remind 'em of me, Let's see how does it feel
To know I fathered you niggas and left you out of my will.

Can't help but think about it all the time.
And you know what's on my mind [x4]
Can't help but think about it all the time.
And you know what's on my mind [x4]

I told her recognize, Smith and Wesson
Now I got her in my bedroom busting
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting

Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting

Don't let the limelight get ya
The hood said we fuckin with you cole say
And we gon' ride right wit ya
Yeah we know you got college degrees
But we got prior's like Richard
And here we are
Raps is like CPR
Nigga turn on your tv, BET, you see a star
Me and my team like ET,
Completely we be from Mars
Damn he got bars as if hes speaking of CB4
Need a barrage
A freaky broads, to keep me hard
Like 3 Nicki Minaj's, flow completely retarded
So I'm deeply regarded as one of the gods
And yes her ass clappin so that a round of applause
I guess

Can't help but think about it all the time.
And you know what's on my mind [x4]
Can't help but think about it all the time.
And you know what's on my mind [x4]

I told her recognize, Smith and Wesson

Yeah they talk but they don't know nothing
Nigga eat a dick we the shit no flushing
Nigga that's disgusting, that's disgusting
What is you discussing?

// The Good Son, Part 1 //

Allow me to set the scene first
This little nigga no older than 17 in a Martin Luther King shirt
Walking down the mean merc where the fiends lurk
And the same dirt'll find a nigga
Even if you tryna get that clean work
He caught eyes with a bad bitch in a jean skirt
She gave him a mean smurk, he smiled back
He remember this man that hit that shit a while back
He met her, fucked her, never dialled back
How niggas do? he kept it moving, couldn't wait to get home
Report card for his mother couldn't wait to get shown
Straight A's as usual, his momma would smile
Youngest child, college bound
Knew his momma was proud
Cause he was headed out the hood
He promised himself one day he'd get her out for good
That made him smile
The favorite child, but damn, fate is foul
Drive by, stray bullets that laid him out
On the pavement fading out
Now he bleeding thinking, God, man, you couldn't wait a while
My momma struggling who gon save her now, huh?
Now he fading out thinking God, you couldn't wait a while?
My momma need me, who gon save her now, nigga? uh
Yeah, he's fading out, her favourie child
He's fading out

// Killers //

[Verse 1]
Momma I just killed a man
My body still trembling can you feel my hand
Don't shed no tears, it won't be long before they find out it was me momma
This may be the last time you see me free ma
Don't spend it cryin'
You did your best, me I was blessed, know you were stressed tryin'
To keep me out the streets, me ducking police
Tryin' not to make a peek to wake you up out your sleep
A drunk and high fool
Skip a class, fluncking high school
I know you taught me better, somehow I never learned
Said I was playing with fire, somehoe I never burned
You tried to set me straight, somehow I never permed
You tried to show me right but somehow I never turned
Lost in a cloud of marijuana, are you sane dummy
Dry your face mommy, your not to blame for me
See I'm a man, I gotta take whatever came for me
At times I wonder 'bout my father
Would it change for me if he was around?
Would I still be running round with the lowlife's
Bum ass niggas no jobs, no life
Seen them niggas killed for no price
I watched his life flash before his eyes like a strobe light
I pulled the trigger momma
Tryna be hard, I ain't mean to kill the nigga momma
But what's done is done
I'm on the run, I live my life like a movie now it's way too realer
Who woulda thought your baby boy woulda grew up to be a killer

Yeh, now I'm a killer
Guess I'm a killer
They got me in here with the killers
Yeah I mean the killers

[Verse 2]
I wonder whats in store for me
Lately been stressing, pray for blessings, hope that there's more for me
Than just a simple life
Niggas that I used to hoop with is doing triple life
Gave up the jump shot
Work on the john shot
Who woulda thought I used to block this niggas lay ups
Now he's in a cell layed up
I wish you well, stay up
Like insomniacs
This life can make a nigga fold like a laundry mat
I sip this cognac though to ease my brain from all this pain
And so that I react slow, in this fast world
Slow niggas, fast girls
Hoes give up ass while these ho niggas hold triggers
Blast on 'em
Hold up that old checker flag for 'em
Chalk lines by the do not park sign
It's deep, all these cold hearted niggas holding heat
I'd rather blast before they steal a nigga
Tell 'em now boy, don't make me turn into a killer

Yeah, into a killer
Don't make me turn into a killer
Yeah, to a killer, yeh yeh

[Verse 3]
To those who had love for me in the past
Who woulda thought time would fly by so fast
I remember back in class we used to make believe
Like it was draft day
Swore that we would make the league, be rich
Saturday morning had to rake the leaves, awww shit
Watch how they pile up
Seem like a mile up
I was the blisters on my hand than I dial up my best friend
Skating ring is where we headed tonight
And if a nigga disrespect, yes we ready to fight
In retrospect that shit seemed petty
At the time, the shit was heavy
Cause life was all about your name
You had to scrap with any nigga that would call you lame
Ashamed no doubt, so many niggas go they brains blown out
Snatched a nigga chain and he got his name rolled out in obituaries
Another body in a cemetary
Another young nigga in the penetentiary
And he don't give a fuck no missionary
Rap visionary, paint a picture nigga pictionary
Tell you what it is, I'm a dictionary
I knew a nigga that threw his dick in every chick in every city that he went to
Went hard like the rent do
Till he met the wrong bitch, man just came home ex-convict
And he stay on with that Thriller
Shit, fucking around with them killers

Yeah, with them killers
Fucking around with them killers
Say I'm a killer

// Nothing Like It //

Yeah, Pistol Pete flow, smoke like a swisha sweet blow
Cole world, get ya Pea Coat
Rappers got no point, niggas miss the free throws so
Ain't no mystery why there picking me for
I've been hot since '97, I ain't Mr Cee though
I am Mr NC boy, with the pen destroy any emcee boy
I'm skinny, didn't eat so I'm hungry like a hostage
Finally seeing money so it's funny how they eyes lit
Surprise it's, that nigga that you should have been on
I handed you niggas my demo, dawg I couldn't get on
One time for my city bitch I'm putting it on
Like a condom when I'm with your girl, ballin' like it's intramural
Back in school, hoopin' to impress the girls
We was young and disconnected from the rest of World
I reminsce on Andrea, eh, God bless ya girl
She used to let me sit in class and caress her curves
Help a nigga get through puberty, the lessons learned
From her, wasn't nothing like it
We passed notes, she read minds like a fucking psychic and write back
I was the class clown, I told jokes and hope she liked that
Rode the bus home and wonder how it be to pipe that
If I was just a little faster I know I could have smashed her
But was just a virgin, couldn't make it past flirting
Now I'm taking baths with there naked ass jerkin
Make It Last forever playing in the background
You can that as whatever I was laying that down
She gon hat emy ass forever, I ain't gon bring her back round
But hold up, what you expect it, how you feeling all neglected?
Sending all them texted spillin on your dresses
We knew just what this was before I was feeling on your breast'es
I never disrespected, I'm clever nigga check it
I tried to warn these women, guess they never get the message
This is Cole, ain't nothing like it
So girls don't wanna fuck him, now they wanna fuckin' like him
And hope you fuckin' wife him

Yeah, nuttin' like him
Yeah, ooh, yeah, oh

Ain't no other, ain't no other niggas
A-ain't no, ain't no other niggas fucking with me
Rappers throwin' jabs but it feel like nothing hit me
Fake niggas, snake niggas I think something bit me
Scratch that, can't impersonate perfection man
But I can school you, this here is the lesson plan
Now uh uh, apparently some of y'all comparing me
Either you blind as hell or either you just don't care to see
Don't make me pull the trigger I think you niggas is daring me
Go fuck around and get your favourite rapper embarrassed, see
I'm the supplier of that fire and the kerosene
Don't wanna make a scene, those ain't no shots fired
Just know the shit that I'm dropping, take you a lot higher
These niggas bitches on the low, they Mrs Doubtfire
How can you doubt fire, man if you brave enough then come put it out Sire
The South by your side, this the mouth for your eyes
You niggas spit it with no one to vouch for your lies
I spit it how you see it, but ain't had the words to say it
I spit it how you think it but ain't had the balls to speak it
I put it out, sit around and let the world critique it
Until the fans up on it early like a nigga leaked it
Just know you fucking with the best, this be our little secret
Until the world find out and then y'all gotta share me
Til then just know there's nothing like him and there's nothing near me
Yeah you fucking hear me
Yeah, yeh

// Holdin' Me Back //

[Chorus: J. Cole]
What's sunshine with no rain
What's joy without no pain
And I'm still gon do my thing
There ain't no holding me back
Hey I'm gon get mine believe that
And what's sunshine with no rain
And what's Joy without no pain
Hey yeah
Yeah hey

[Verse: J. Cole:]
The city fucked up even thug niggas getting robbed.
Know it's bad when the drug dealers getting jobs
Same niggas who skipped out on graduation
At the gas station filling out the applications but
They ain't calling me back
Best friends be our references
Pay checks spent on necklaces
Down payments on the Lexuses
Debit in the negative
Overdraft with the sky overcast
But I'm screaming fuck the pessimist
Cause there ain't no holding me back, huh
The little nigga had big dreams to do big things
But in this thing everything ain't what this shit seems
Trying hard to come up in the flag pole just to
Find out your heroes is some assholes
But there ain't no hlding me back

// Wildfire //

[Drake:]
Yeah
Oh, nah, I'm ready
Yeah, let's go
Your girlfriend at my next show, OVOXO nigga
Yeah

Uh, Wassup
Real nigga doing real stuff
Get a lot of money you can never get enough
And you know the new shit sound so tough
So-and-so just walked in, so what?
I don't really vibe with a lot of these niggas
I ain't really into giving more than one chance
Girl I already tried with a lot of these niggas
Fuck that
That team don't know real, what's that
That can't be from here
That can't be what they believing is the best shit of the year
That's that fake shit that's that fake shit, that's that top row of veneers
Just when they getting impatient's when I make a world premier
Aw, Damn, Word
Award shows coming?
Make sure you spell the shit right
Make sure to gimme all the credit I deserve
Make sure the good stuff's still in that Sprite
They watch us, make the shit into a song
You ain't living that boy, stop stealing that light
Anything can happen when I do see y'all, guess it all depends how I'm feeling that night
Okay
Live my life in hotels, bitch better have my room right
If they kill me, bury me a legend
Bitch better have my tomb right
Ahh
This is perfect for the women that I've loved before
I love em all, I just love me more

[Yukimi Nagano (Little Dragon):]
I could bet all of the riches that I ever had
Rush in the night like a shock, babe, would it be bad?
If I had to -
Set the alarm cause those thrills that run up my back
You're my star nothing else can lead me off track


Hey-yeaahh....
You're like a wildfire
You got me rising hot
Your innocence -
Who's the brave?
Drowning in
Would you save me?
It's a crime
If you don't
You'll expire
By the throat

// Return Of Simba //

In my freshest Js, I ain't slept in days
Girl, you gon' make me late undressin' me
Know you ain't seen me since yesterday
But, see, I got a date with destiny
'Cause this the summer that our life change
Hov asked me, "Is you ready for it?"
I looked around at all his nice things
Told him, "Nigga, you already know it"

Bitch, I'm the man of the year
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Straight through this bitch (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm the man of the year

What you 'sposed to do when the OG niggas don't get it?
Lost what was once theirs but they won't quit it
Homie, it's a new era, middle finger to the suit-wearers
Lemme show you how to move in a room
Full of dudes that don't got a fuckin' clue how to do this
Prolly worked with Cube, so to them, this a Rubik
My President is black, but my jeweler's still Jewish
So you know it cost, he makin' a killin' off me
Red diamonds he designin' got me shinin'
Spotlight cover my body, my chain blindin'
A cop light runner, they wanna but can't find him
Me and Hovi Hov, out on the same island
Took the whip to the other side of Jamaica
Seen how he was livin', said "I gotta get my weight up"
Formulated my plan, motivated by dreams
Parlayed wit' my mans, motivated my team
Ced said, "Look, my niggas, we got a foot in"
Bein' good is good, that'll get you Drew Gooden
But me, I want Jordan numbers, LeBron footin'
Can't guard me, Vince Lombardi, John Wooden
Garbage? Hardly, you niggas silly like Chris Farley
So like him, you'll be gone too early
Mama hands together like 6:30
And Cole keep a thick bitch I like to call Big Shirley
All my '90s niggas is gon' get it
18 and under, that's prolly gon' take a minute
I'ma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
I'ma be here for a while, none of these clowns can hurt me
At the time of this rhyme, five years 'til I know thirty
Cole World in the summer brings snow flurries
This next shit is in no way to boast
But my city love breakfast, 'cause niggas had toast early
Coach had us doin' jumpin' jacks
Then sent us to the water fountain after runnin' laps
My nigga went and grabbed his bookbag, threw it on his back
And brought it to me just to show me he was fuckin' strapped
We was twelve years old, how was we to know better?
I analyzed his life and see that he was so set up
Live by the trigger, 'cause no father figure
Means you don't got a nigga comin' 'round to guide a nigga
All you got is mama bringin' home these rotten niggas
Blowin' reefers, all the teachers do is ride a nigga
So this is who I speak fo'
To give the young niggas somethin' they could reach fo'
You better dream, boy
Yeah, I stunt, but I'm a li'l more realer
When it come from the heart, don't it feel mo' iller?
Watch my flow go bananas, I'm a li'l gorilla
So pardon me, man, y'all gon' have to pardon me
They say I rep that 'Ville too much, but that shit just a part of me
It's flowin' out through my arteries, who hard as me? You JV, I'm varsity
No field trip, ain't hard to see, this real shit, you R&B
Seen a movie wit' yo' bitch in it, and listen it, was starrin' me
(Woo!) That boy Simba crazy
Hotter that Ike Turner temper, you December, maybe
And though you wish me well, I know deep down you wish I'd fail
It's Judgment Day, I'm here to give you pussy niggas hell
And some food for thought, I can serve a plate
Wit' dessert to take, wit' dessert to take
Yeah, I heard the hate, but the wait is fuckin' over
It's like I'm fuckin' Oprah, well worth the wait
Maybe over your head, I'm ahead of my time
Niggas scared of my future, I know they dreadin' my prime
'Cause I only made classics, now what that take? Timing
Cole under pressure, what that make? Diamonds
(Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds..)
