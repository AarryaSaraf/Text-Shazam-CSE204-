// Under The Sun //

[J. Cole:]
If you miss me
And you can't find
I done seen it all, my God
Yeah
I done seen it all, my God, I swear
Uh, uh

Nothing new under the sun, nobody fucking with son
I got a couple of sons, a couple of guns
A couple of niggas that bust up the party and fuck up the fun
She digging me and I'm cuffing her friend
She ig'-ing you while we fucking for fun
I got her suckin' her thumb, that's my lil' baby
She call me daddy like grandmama baby
If this Sunday dinner, my hand on her gravy
I been on the craziest wave, if I'm on the stage
An M is my minimum wage
This ain't no kennel, behave
Niggas is with all that barking, we send 'em a stray
So in a way we the dogcatchers
How many bullets your dawg catchin'?
Sawed-off, raw dog fashion
Hauled off, hope God catch him, damn

I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with, ayy

[Lute:]
Potato over my gun
I move in silence 'cause niggas be clocking my funds
When they should keep eye on they bitch 'cause baby girl coming with son
Niggas be judging my moves, but please tell me, what have you done?
My cousin might air out the party for fun
Pistol grips get to squeezing
Wish a nigga would like Liam Neeson
I don't even need a reason, loyalty over treason
Bitch nigga, come and see me
Put some respect on my name
What side of my city I claim
I try to stay in my lane
Took my advance and put a cold piece on them thangs
I'm Beatties Ford 'til the wheels fall
Know some niggas probably pissed off
Who would thought I made it this far?
Gold Mouf, bitch, fuck 'em all

I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with

[DaBaby:]
I just put diamonds on all of my teeth, now they probably think I ain't intelligent
In the homicide unit interrogation, asking questions, you know I ain't tell 'em shit
Bitches call me a jock, all-American
I'm at the top of my class with my letterman
I remember back in college, bitches knocking on my dorm door
I ain't never let 'em in
Now you know that that's cap, know I hit a few
Ain't no job, I'm selling gas like I'm Jiffy Lube
I had a freak, used to fuck while her boyfriend in class
I hit her from the back from like 10 to 2
No back and forth with these rappers
They mention me, dissin' me
No talkin' back, I won't mention you
Watch, when I come put that iron on your ass and I dip
They gon' want me to snitch in my interviews
I'm on fire, bitch, I'm lit, but I'm really cool
Don't acknowledge the shrimps when they ridicule
They don't come out after dark, bitch, I swim with the sharks
You ain't got enough heart, get a bigger pool
Wanna fight but he bigger, I ain't really trippin'
I reach under my shirt, grab a bigger tool
I got a Glock with a dick, let's get physical
They gon' be hollerin' out, "Rip," and they missin' you
They got me started, I might as well finish (Talk your shit, nigga)
I'm from Charlotte, you know how these niggas do
Baby

I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with

// Down Bad //

[Young Nudy:]
Tell 'em, slime

Yeah, I am the king of the E.A.
Get this bitch screwed like the DJ (Big slime)
Yeah, I am the shit where we play
We got the chalk where we play (Okay)
Yeah, come through the city
We gon' chop your ass up just like some sushi (Yeah)
AK-47, stick go stupid (Yeah)
Draw the money out, all the way...

[JID:]
Okay, lil' dirty, nappy-headed East Atlanta nigga
Father said that I was a force
.44, Hank Aaron chrome
Wanna make it home? Then get out the Porsche
Let a nigga cover FADER 'fore I have to fade a nigga at the FADER Fort
It's tomato or tomato, either way, the boy the greatest
Play it, I won't say it no more
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown
Board of Education vs. Brown
I was bored of education, left the town
Fuck a résumé and fuck a cap and gown
Fuck a background check back 'round when I get the check
Nigga, that's now

I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown (Oh, shit)
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown

[Bas:]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
Picked up the pad, picked up the slack
Pick of the litter, don't litter no bag
Bassy been pickin' up racks, raps comin' clearer than Acuvue 2
When I'm back in the booth
Got 'em hackin' a Shaq 'cause they lackin' the juice
Niggas droppin' the ball, they on Shaqtin' a Fool
Actavis drool down the side of your face
We ain't jackin' it, we ain't dappin' them fools
Get a napkin, you dudes is embarassin'
Who going crazy like us? No comparison
Dreamville like Marion Jones on the steroids
Y'all niggas slow as a heroin high
Y'all had a year, y'all had a year
Y'all had a year, but you let it go by
Yee

[JID:]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown (Oh, shit)
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown

[J. Cole:]
Dreamville head honcho
Bitch, we came from nothin' just like the big bang theory
That poverty stains kept the pain buried
And covered the shame with a dream
We would have fortune and fame
A mil' in the bank, chameleon paint turned cranberry
Now little Jermaine got the same story
As that boy out of St. Vincent-St. Mary: G.O.A.T.
All hail King Cole, first of his name, long may he reign
The boy got the throne, but you know it ain't a game
Ville nigga, I was born in the same
Pressure cooker that's been known to bust a lump of coal and make a diamond
Two six, we enrolled in Reaganomics
Crew sick, we the Golden State of rhyming, on God

[Johnny Venus:]
You could die today, so be hell to pay
I'm a livin', breathin', schemin' testimony
So don't test me, homie, put that in ya, homie
Put a foot up that ass, you a steppin' stone
All my niggas ain't gettin' no sleep
All of my niggas be chasin' their dreams
Ooh, I'm a force of nature, I can't wait to date ya
I was havin' problems 'til I had to break through
All my tattoos for sure, they ain't never for show
Might get tattoo'd on tour, tell ya ho get the door
Spend my time makin' love to your thoughts
Gon' get in line, baby, slut up your mind
It's a brand new season, I'm a righteous heathen
I take on the challenge and I leave it bleedin'
I was down bad, now I'm even Steven
And I'm leavin', leavin' every fuckin' weekend (Oh)

[JID:]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown (Oh, shit)
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown

// LamboTruck //

[Childish Major:]
Ayy, what's those? You want these
You gotta have fees plus more
So much heat you can't hold
A lot of green, kind that can't fold
What's those? You want these
You gotta have fees plus more
So much heat you can't hold
Whole lot of green, kind that can't fold

[Cozz:]
Oh yeah
Lookin' great but feeling bummy
I just ate, but still I'm hungry
I got something, but I ain't nothing
Brother tummy isn't chubby
Bills like nymphos, they keep coming
Always something, something, something
Copped some things but I ain't fed
Dreams alive, my wallet dead
Pockets been bleeding
I got a reason to commit treason
But I'ma hit REASON and see what he think
About how he been treated at TDE
'Cause I done been scheming
Schoolboy just dropped, give me the cue
I'm desperate enough to go do what it do
SZA done popped and y'all got Dot
I heard Jay Rock has been moving them units
Soul and Isaiah Rashad, boy, you niggas really at the top
Almost thought about popping a Glock
But a nigga ain't stupid and I ain't a shooter
But who really is until they provoked?
Nigga, this hunger got me finna choke
Starting to think that this isn't a joke
Gave up the liquor, I'm bringing the smoke
I talked to Bas, we fiending for more
A nigga done tried speaking to Cole
He be too busy but he be the bro
Shit, fuck it, I know how it go
So if I can't get a response from my label
And get some more food on my table
We can turn this thing into a fable
And take what I can if I'm able

[Childish Major:]
Ayy, what's those? You want these
You gotta have fees plus more
So much heat you can't hold
A lot of green, kind that can't fold
What's those? You want these
Gotta have fees plus more
So much heat you can't hold
Whole lot of green, kind that can't fold

[REASON:]
Yeah yeah, woah
Top Dawg with some Dreamers
Can't believe it, you surprised, 'prised
I been on the same shit, getting brain, I'm such a wise guy
Niggas took shots, plenty, South Park, Kenny, I don't die die
I'm not just gonna slide on you, my nigga, we gon' slide slide
Made a living staying posted like I'm Diesel, this no sequel
This that third times a charm and I been charming, Cozz been evil
You get clips, this hammer regal
Unexpected, there you have, it's been affected
So ill, these words infectious
I don't do ho shit, niggas so hopeless
I been on pro shit, this West Coast shit
We don't negotiate with roaches
I keep it player, never need coaches
Never need towels, no teammate
Drink some Jamie, I can't see straight
Cheese like Green Bay, roger that
New West niggas, me and Cozz been that
Good weed bring a nigga asthma back
Getting good bread, got my wallet stacked
Lately, been spinning like laundromats
Lately, I been seeing all kinds of black
Wait, look, I'm lying, look
Cozz, look, I done been broke too long
Nigga bills too long, can't hide that, nigga
Cole just pulled up in a Lamborghini truck
On the homies and God, we should rob that nigga

[Cozz & REASON:]
Rob that nigga?
Yeah, rob that nigga
Look, Rob, my nigga
You could try, but Cole ain't a thot, my nigga
Wait Cozz, I ain't sayin' he a thot, my nigga
Look, let me explain
We could tie Ib up
Throw him in the back of a Lamborghin' truck
Cole do something, we could let a Glock squeeze up
Wait chill, ease up
I ain't really trying to get involved, my nigga, look
We ain't got the same father or mother, but that's my brother
Can't cross my nigga
Shit, well I'm Top Dawg, my nigga, so
I ain't gotta pay a cost, my nigga
Your loss, my nigga, just don't off that nigga
Shit, fuck it, I'll stop
Look, let's make a deal
While I go and rob Cole, you go rob Top
Cool

[REASON:]
Picture me having what they told me I should have
I've been living off scraps, I done sold a couple packs
I been smoking potent, sippin' slow, fuck you think I'm in it for?
I'm just tryna make a bag
I'll be damned if I ain't make a bag
Thinking slow, living fast
Nice guys finish last
West Coast, getting cash
Niggas think they balling, they done made a couple wads
Just a couple West niggas, we gon' show you how to rob

// Swivel //

[Doctur Dot:]
Head on a swivel
Trouble lurkin' 'round the corner
Run up on you any minute, you'll be gone
Yeah

Nigga, keep your head on a swivel
Trouble lurkin' 'round the corner
Run up on you any minute, you'll be gone
I know niggas dead out of desperation
RIP my nigga Allen Dem, I wish you would've stayed at home
Learned to make the best out of shitty situation
No complaining, no more Xan, I leave the medicine alone
Y'all gon' swear to God that I'm changing for the better
Fuck whoever got the nerve to try to tell me that I'm wrong

I done made it up, I done made it out
I done made a way, we been makin' waves, we been making sounds
Rappers hella fake, they papier-mâché
Like piñata, they can't wait to break, I can animate
Promise mama she gon' see the day when we all okay
All it really take is time and dedication, I pray
For the hunger to be permanent, no matter what that make
Hey, batter, batter, swing, bake
Whip the batter for the cake

Nigga, keep your head on a swivel
Trouble lurkin' 'round the corner
Run up on you any minute, you'll be gone
I know niggas dead out of desperation
RIP my nigga Allen Dem, I wish you would've stayed at home
Learned to make the best out of shitty situation
No complaining, no more Xan, I leave the medicine alone
Y'all gon' swear to God that I'm changing for the better
Fuck whoever got the nerve to try to tell me that I'm wrong

I don't know what it is, man, I just
I don't think I'ma be here much longer, man
Something's watching me, man
Something's following me
Something want me dead, man
Pray for me, pray for me, please

[Johnny Venus:]
Hell, when I was young, I ain't had to pop no guns
Nothing cracking in the slums you couldn't handle on your own
Shit around my block where we used to knock
Couple souls fly, wasn't nothin' like you guys, which I loan
Shit it wasn't nice, wasn't paradise
Wasn't lights back to back to back, many nights was on our own
Mama had to work, papa had three jobs
No, we not Jamaican, my sir, but we all was robbed, hah
Should've kept my head on a weave and bob
I'd rather be dead than to weep and sob
So we solve any major prob with the quick resolve
Had to squab', circle that bitch up, feelings get involved
Neighborhood on lock, fuck we need a cop?
That was way back way 'fore Reagan passed the rock
Left us with a needle and a jumpshot
Leave you countin' seconds on the fingers through the gunshots

[Doctur Dot:]
Nigga, keep your head on a swivel
Trouble lurkin' 'round the corner
Run up on you any minute, you'll be gone
I know niggas dead out of desperation
RIP my nigga Allen Dem, I wish you would've stayed at home
Learned to make the best out of shitty situation
No complaining, no more Xan, I leave the medicine alone
Y'all gon' swear to God that I'm changing for the better
Fuck whoever got the nerve to try to tell me that I'm wrong

// Oh Wow...Swerve //

[Zoink Gang:]
Oh wow
You want the next part, kablaow
Yeah, kablaow, yeah
Hold up, oh wow, shit
That's the part
Shit, I'm proud
The track
Got a whole lot of cash
Kablaow
I put a hole in your

Oh wow (Oh wow, oh wow)
She got a big old ass, I'm proud (But)
I got a whole lot of cash, kablaow
I put a hole in your ass (And then), I'm out
Like a motherfuckin' lamp

[J. Cole:]
Smoke in my nappy dreads, how you scared to die, nigga?
Don't believe that lie, I think that everybody happy dead
Hell is a fabricated figment of imagination
I done seen worse for real right there off 'Yac and behind gas station
Cambridge Homes, 'partments where the girls get damaged young
From overexposure to the vultures
And prey on them like pastors is supposed to
If they wasn't so concerned about the tags that's on they clothes, but
Guess that's how it goes, fuck it, what do I know?
Ain't been in service since Jim Jones had somethin' with Hov
I document my life with rap beefs, love songs, favorite albums
In years that my niggas got blood on they sneakers from bodies they might've caught
I don't judge no one, I'm just knowin'
At night, when it get quiet, that shit could fuck with 'em
And if it don't right now, it's gon' catch up to 'em
Guilt heavy as a cloud in a thunderstorm, huh
My niggas blowing loud like an elephant
It's helpin' 'em to cope, I don't do nothin' if it don't
Make somethin', make a dollar
Make me wonder, make me prouder
Make me karma, make me better
I ain't no killer, don't make me have to, nigga
You want my spot, well maybe after, nigga
So active on the radio, I'm radioactive, nigga
That's a bar, I had to give it to 'em
Never slouching, not even on couches in the living room
And I feel like the world is ending soon
Is there any good or bad? Well that's depending on you
And if you wake up in time
I know it's better to be sleep, that's why we hate the alarm
I feel you

[Zoink Gang:]
Oh wow (Oh wow, oh wow)
She got a big old ass (She got a big old butt), I'm proud (What?)
I got a whole lot of cash (Racks, racks), kablaow
I put a hole in your ass (And then), I'm out
Like a motherfuckin' lamp

[KEY!:]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
Bizness Boi
Yeah, uh
Oh yeah

If I keep moving like this, then I'm a god
Happy on the outside, jealous on the inside
And I know it inside, inside out, ayy
What this shit here mean? It's the Japanese, huh
If I keep moving like this, then I'm a god
Happy on the outside, jealous on the inside
And I know it inside, inside out, ayy
What this shit here mean? It's the Japanese, huh

[Maxo Kream:]
The way I'm robbin', niggas say I'm gonna die
I bought a baby Draco carbon, that's a motherfuckin' lie
Stephen Curry on my hip, Klay Thompson, let it fly
Southwest Murder Block Crips, we don't die, we multiply (Crip)
Maxo talk a lot of shit but is he really 'bout that life? (Say what?)
Is a pig's pussy pork and can a caterpillar fly? (That's right)
Go Go Gadget, toting ratchets, beam attachment on the side
I keep a savage that'll blast it, my crash dummies down to ride
These niggas janky than a bitch, I do my shit up on my lonely
So I can't trust you on a lick if you not Nina, Mac, or Tommy
Traphouse serving like hibachi, Draco, chopstick, baby AK
Different flavors like Tekashi, twelve gauge shotty like I'm Tr3yway
Maxo Kobe, holy moly, servin' smokey like I'm Dae Dae
Runnin' out of dog food like I fed Chico
Put a brick on your head and get you dropped like Deebo
I'm slangin' bricks like Craig, I'm tryna drop these bows

[KEY!:]
If I keep moving like this, then I'm a god
Happy on the outside, jealous on the inside
And I know it inside, inside out, ayy
What this shit here mean? It's the Japanese, huh
If I keep moving like this, then I'm a god
Happy on the outside, jealous on the inside
And I know it inside, inside out, ayy
What this shit here mean? It's the Japanese, huh

[JID:]
Look
Alright, I fucked up my whip 'cause I'm high and I swerve
Sorry that I scared you, I didn't do that on purpose
My life been fucked up so I got problems with my nerves
My hands get sweaty

Yeah

I got the chopper, yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy

I got the chopper, it sing like opera, I make it swoon the bitch

[Bas:]
I ain't opposed
She threw the pussy and I ain't opposed
Fighting the lows
Smoking this shit 'til my eyelids are closed
I wear the sheepskin but I am the wolf
I am the poster-child
Finessing the lion that's posing in clothing and lying
To open it, hope that these niggas'll try him
I smoke 'em, I smoke 'em, I

[Yung Baby Tate:]
I fry 'em, I sizzle 'em
They bitin', they nibblin'
They lyin', they fibbin' it
They childish, they children
They quiet, they whispering
They dying, I'm killin' 'em
They dry, I'm drippin' in
They crying, I'm teachin', man

[Guapdad 4000:]
Ayy, I got the chopper, it sing like opera, I make it swoon the bitch

I come to you as humbly as I know how
Off hella the drugs and I'm out of my mind
In the meantime, I'ma just smoke this loud

Get a shot of Hennessy just to wash it down
All my white friends call me talkin' proper now
I got the BET's just so I'm hoppin' out (Yeah)

[JID:]
He without sin cast the first stone
Told my nigga with the gun he can run in your home
One dome shot, niggas'll never look at him wrong again
Oh my God, oh my God, on this lick
In the car twisted, come here, lil' bitch
Suck on my dick, some of the fun under your sister
Come, come, give me some, tongue, tongue, get it done
Young fun, yum, yum, yum, I'm twisted

Get my gun, we 'bout to rob a Wells Fargo
(Whatever I said, I don't know what I said, I don't give a fuck, ah)
Guns and broads, we need to get a whole carload

With my dawgs, we pull up looking like a car show
(Are you getting this?)
Smoke a blunt and then she get up off my narcos

[Johnny Venus:]
Yo, vulture just fall in the money

Baby, whatever, just come on, just hop in and get in the car and we go and get boof
Stragglers is off and they fallin', whatever, just tell 'em to tell 'em better not make a move

[Guapdad 4000:]
Hey, skrrt skrrt in a new thing
Throw the cash and she gettin' Raekwon like the Wu-Tang

Nigga, it's just how you count it
It just depend on how you count it

// Sleep Deprived //

Ayy
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Yeah
Hey, hey
Uh

[Lute:]
I met this girl the other day that wanna know my story
She said since the world against me, she all for me
I told her God must've overheard my hopeful wish
And crazy how I never would've thought to be in this position
'Cause see hip-hop saved my life is such a cliché quote
But before I grabbed the mic, I was the poster-child of broke, uh
Signed my first deal off the realest shit I wrote
I told my city I'm the closest thing to hope
Used to be barely above water, now I float
Same bitches in my DM's used to take me for a joke
Niggas talk crow, shit behind my back and then call me bro
Like bro, you gotta match one before you blow
I always leave the message on seen 'cause I don't smoke
When really I don't fuck with half these niggas on the low
And that's just how it go
She go, "Damn, nigga, that's deep," I know, tell me about it
My life be full of stress, fake niggas, and sleep deprivin' like uh

[Mez:]
Dreams, all my shit been colossal though
Used to be honor roll, now it's foreign whips I'm riding on
Now everything I flow hot as fuck, I mean poblano though
Me and Lute 'posed to been did this shit, it's perfect timing though
Remember us being younger, talking about gettin' signed to Cole?
I was so hot-headed then, I'm a lot calmer though
Tryna buy me a brick house when I get comma though
Money gon' help with a lot of things but not the trauma though
Had so many adventure times, we used to run from the jakes
To make it for Southside, we do whatever it takes
It was apartheid when my barber parted my fade
'Cause now I'm pulled left and right by Keshia and Adrinae
All this shit gets so deep, man, I'm hoping y'all dive in
I don't fuck with surviving, I'm only thinkin' 'bout thriving
But you way too afraid, yeah, I know what your vibe is
Always worried 'bout me, that shit must be sleep depriving

That shit must be sleep depriving

[DaVionne:]
I ain't never had nothin', yeah, I had to work for it
Prayed to God every day, even went to church for it
Built from the ground up, played in the dirt for it
God told me it would work out, I took his word for it
We all come from a very different path
Look at what we been through, look at where we at
Got 'em losing sleep worried 'bout what we on
Said I wouldn't make it but I always prove wrong, yeah

Yeah

[Omen:]
Turn into a big deal, but way realer than Black Friday
They let a visionary vibrate
Hoppin' through the Tri-State
I got this bird box simply off a blind date
Now I'm in a tryin' state
Turn into a horror story
Broke my heart to the point I had to find tape
Bringing Lysol, sage, just to wipe her away like eternal sunshine
Pulled up in a drop spot like some summer times
Seen you with some other guy, long story, summarize
Writing on the wall, got your message under mine
I been gettin' high, summer crime, ever since
Wonder why ill intent was inside of your skin, damn
Dookey braids, droopy eyes, it was groupie love
Hurt feelings, no cap like bougie clubs
Sat alone deep in silence
Thinkin' 'bout you gettin' sleep deprivin', yeah

[DaVionne:]
I ain't never had nothin', yeah, I had to work for it
Prayed to God every day, even went to church for it
Built from the ground up, played in the dirt for it
God told me it would work out, I took his word for it
We all come from a very different path
Look at what we been through, look at where we at
Got 'em losing sleep worried 'bout what we on
Said I wouldn't make it but I always prove wrong, yeah

// Self Love //

[Ari Lennox:]
I said
Tired of being cordial
Tired of being normal
Tired of being forced in
Tied up in the moment
I'm leaving with outer purpose
Wearing it on the surface, love
Making it look good
Meanwhile it's been hurting, oh

Self love is the best love
See your love is the worst drug
Self love is the best love
But your love is the worst drug

[Ari Lennox & Baby Rose:]
Ah, ah-ah-ah (Ah)
Hey, hee
Ah, ah-ah-ah (Oh)

[Baby Rose:]
Tired of all this faking
Wearing all of this makeup
And meanwhile feeling complacent
Fitting in, feeling basic and
Meanwhile tryna replace him
But all these feelings are makeshift
Hard for me to face it
When everything is changing, ayy

Self love is the best love
But your love was the worst drug
Self love is the best love
But your love is the worst drug

Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah (Oh)

[Bas:]
Take it in vain, this pain is a feeling that we can't ignore
Dealer man, hand me more
A baby in a candy store
I got secrets that just can't leave tour
How did we go from lost in your arms to arms in a conflict?
Long arm my conscience
Lost in my thoughts
The cost of my art, we growing apart
You growing irate
Stuck in the door of my state
I carry my Gemini traits
I bury my face
Shameful hands, took your hand
Led you astray, as you would say
As soon as we clash, you adjudicate
As for the date, it was like last June or May
We were like "let's do the break", 'cause

[Baby Rose:]
Self love is the best love
But your love was the worst drug
Self love is the best love
But your love is the worst drug

Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah (Oh)

// Ladies, Ladies, Ladies //

[JID:]
I always wanted to do one of these type shits

Uh, I had a yellow girl, called her, "Dandelion"
She be panty-less, so no panty lines
She's from Campbellton, north of county line
Steady hands, never let her count the bands, though
She fucked me, tryna pluck a couples bucks like a banjo
Had a girl that was a artist, she could draw, her name Tracy
She always outta line, making Mona Lisa faces
And we argue all the time, but we fuck like we crazy
She said her favorite thing is face painting
I used to have this white shorty, always hanging with the black folk
She used to bump Black Thought, I saw her using black soap
That's a wack thought, ain't wanna kick her to the curb
Until she asked me, can she say the N word?
Hey, can I say "nigga" around you?
Some nerve
I knew a girl from Jersey who use to love Donny Hathaway
And she was from Piscataway
Her brother pulled a gun on me, she told him "Put the gat away"
I was tapping that ass, I'll never forget the Saturday
But it don't even matter like D'Angelo and Laur' Hill
I had a country girl from Alabama down in Mobile
At that time, she had mo' bills than me
And she, her, had no time to chill with me
I still miss her, I wonder where could she be?
Hand me the Fronto leaf
Hey, damn bro, I don't think we got no more
Alght, let's go to the store
Aight nigga, shit, but we driving yo' shit
You driving?

[T.I.:]
Young nigga, you don't know nothing 'bout no bitches
Listen

Now as we smoke and ride and reminisce
I'm thinking back to a time when I was younger, done with single nigga privileges
I had a chick, her name was Loraine, did anything for me
On the day she get her hair done, walk in the rain for me
Pick Sharika up and stole the car, she wasn't ashamed of me
Trapping hard, slept on the floor, and never complained to me
My baby went into stores and did her thang for me
Even ran from police and got it back on the train for me
Lame to me, half of these bitches, laugh at these bitches
'Til the point you go on IG and you can rap for these bitches
Not to say I wouldn't tackle these bitches, given the chance
If it happened, it was destiny, shit was out of my hands
I'm saying...

Man...
They say karma is constant
That means it's just... it's a consistent cycle of...
Good and bad
Coming and going from every source of... life...
Existing on Earth, so...
If I fucked a bitch real good back in the day
You know what I'm saying?
I'm talking like real good and like made her feel, you know
Like the woman that it made her into the woman that she is right now
Then I'd expect somebody should be coming to fuck me real good any day now
I mean it's karma, right?
Shit

Drunken partying, slobbering, 'nother sloppy night
Always fight with my mama, but look, on my leave night
I'll call her, when I'm a baller, I promise that I'ma score you
Until then, I'ma ignore you, it's nothing personal (Sorry)
I'm just tryna fuck a couple girls and go
Can't do that while I'm on the phone
I'm not a mother's boy, I'm a motherfucker

[Buddy:]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, hold on, hold on, nigga

[JID:]
Look, okay the weed so strong it got me stressed
The stress so strong it got me weak
I'm so on, it threw me off (Yeah)
I'm throwed off, yes indeed
I threw up after my threesome
On my threads, had to leave the crime scene like criminals do
She wanna come to my crib and give me a genital smooch
Typical, typical, get the piccolo, skididdle, skedaddle
I sling peen like Colossal
That mean king save the queen from the castle
I grab the saddle
Prisoner to prescription, it's changed, jackal, Jack Daniels
Shawty tryna tell me

[Buddy:]
Motherfucker, ayy, didn't I say? Nigga, ayy

Stop rappin', nigga, this is not a rap session
We gettin' high

[J. Cole:]
If I smoke a blunt right now
I'ma be on 285 with my pants pulled down
Around my ankles
Still no stranger to the blunt smoke, gun smoke
You niggas don't want smoke
No guts like that Swisher we just smoked
We cutthroat, niggas...

Let me try one more time

// Rembrandt... Run It Back //

[JID:]
You don't give a damn, then we don't give a fuck
On God, I been waitin' for one of y'all pussy niggas to buck
Still starving, ribs touching
Touch the team and you get touched like homescreen buttons
Hoes scream loud, Jennifer Hudson when them thangs start bustin'
Alright

Shit talk and slick talk
Pissed off, stick talk
Diss track, get mad
Rap niggas big trash
Your squad, my squad
Mismatched, pissants
Cheese chase, gym rats
Picture paint, Rembrandts
Tree trunk, thin branch
I leave, come back
This fall, diss all y'all niggas I came up with
My, what a bit of a change up
These niggas lame, we in minimal danger
I got the banger, just give me the next
My nigga put me in the game and I'm ready to flame, I'm anxious
Put the motherfuckin' bank on it

[J. Cole:]
Big nuts hangin', big bucks bringin', fuck 'em all
No slut shamin', money in the Cayman, I'm appalled
Niggas swear they bangin', feds got 'em singin on the squad
Crack rock slangin' on blacktop pavement, tryna ball
Line 'em up on the wall, three deep, final call
Knee-deep, squeeze three, beep beep, Tylenol
Pulled up, one deep, no squad, just me
Just God, no prob', real niggas tend to fuck wit' me
No jewelry, no stunt for me
Just a Bentley truck, and an empty cup of whatever that is
You too concerned 'bout how clever that is
Me, I'm concerned how much bread that it is
Or letters that it is
I been got my mama, I'll get off of this
I'm fucking the game, you niggas is lame
You won't even get a little head out of this
Bet I'ma miss, you niggas is dense, my hits goin' over the fence
How is you niggas so rich? I'm not so convinced, my wrist costin' more than your whip
And I don't wear that no more, that shit there look tacky
Yeah, I'm the G.O.A.T., no nigga, don't at me
Put on your coat, the world gon' get colder
This is my year, don't say I ain't told you, nigga

[JID:]
You don't give a damn, then we don't give a fuck
On God, I been waitin' for one of y'all pussy niggas to buck
Still starving, ribs touching
Touch the team and you get touched like homescreen buttons
Hoes scream loud, Jennifer Hudson when them thangs start bustin'

Ayy, ayy, nigga, ayy, ayy
Ayy, yo, uh-uh
Ayy, yo
Ayy, ain't this that, um...
Ayy, ain't this the Dreamville shit? This the, um...

I had a dream, I had a Glock, I had a beam, run it back
I had a dream, she in Celine, I'm in Supreme, run it back
Y'all had the dream, I had the guap, I hit the green, run it back
Ready to go, ready to score, ready for war, run it back
I'm finna bring the summer back
I'm finna bring the Hummer back
Snuck my gun in the function
I bust, he not coming back
Dummy racks, hundred stacks
Police killed 'bout a hundred blacks
Don't get killed tryna run a lap
Nigga don't get killed tryna run a...

Mmh, niggas want smoke, I want it too
Roses are red, my diamonds are blue
Pockets is green, a permanent hue
My niggas get work like assignments is due
Just made a mil', I counted it once
I think I go spread it around in the slums
265, that's where I'm from
Help me get used to the sound of the drum
Rolls Royce riding down Sunset
I must get a crib in LA
Fuck a nigga finna tell me?
Catch him slipping, send him to Raleigh
Big ass chopper make God flinch
Ducking from the boys in the field
Just as good as poison with the steel
Hesitation always get you killed, nigga

I wanna pop my shit
I wanna cop my whip in cash
On that note, pull up on them folks
In an all black Ghost like Christmas Past
This shit's ass
Low-key rich with the same outfit that I did just have
Pardon the smoke, that's just my staff
Quick Stop, never seen this much gas, nigga
I got a story to tell you to speak for the niggas that never could speak for theyself
I was off Cumberland Road when a couple of niggas mistook me for somebody else
I put the pedal to metal when I seen the muzzle, I couldn't help but think to myself
Boy, keep your ass in the house, the city is bad for your health

Mmh, niggas want smoke, I want it too
Roses are red, my diamonds are blue
Pockets is green, a permanent hue
My niggas get work like assignments is due
Just made a mil', I counted it once

[Young Nudy:]
(Y'all really with the shit)
Pull up on your block, ain't no hesitation
Hit you with the stick, try to run, you ain't gon' make it
Whole lot of money on your head, gotta take it
Roll through your hood like some dice, we gon' shake it
Bitch turned up in the spot booty shakin', yeah (Nasty)
I like this bitch gettin' naked, yeah (Yeah, bitch)
Fuck for the money, she crazy, huh (Yeah, bitch)
Paradise East, from the bricks, yeah, they made me
Nigga wanna hate, gettin' money, say I'm crazy (Okay)
Shit bankroll, ain't nothin' but big faces
Spread it in your face, make a motherfucker hate me
Whole lot of money, make me wanna come take it
I'm in the hood where this shit ain't safe
It's okay, got a Glock, AK
Niggas try to play, I'ma hit 'em in the face

[J. Cole:]

// MIDDLE CHILD //

You good, T-Minus?

Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain't poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This shit gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

Money in your palm don't make you real
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
Money in your palm don't make you real

// PTSD //

[Mereba:]
Used to bend for me like the steel of a hatchback
You was there for Q like a fourth grade class fact
Q was in for me, never needed to ask that
PTSD, now I'm having a flashback
Told me I'm sweet, can't sleep in the trap trap
Enemy, envy, make the strap go brrat brrat
You the missing piece, no peace when I sleep now
Used to practice peace, finna sleep with the piece now
Know I'ma miss you long as I'm alive
You said you need to call me, be sure I tried
I wish I didn't have a song to write
I know you probably follow me with your light

[Deante' Hitchcock:]
My mama told me faith is all that I need
And back in the day I would've agreed, but now it's hard to believe
I still do not, 'cause I want, 'cause I need to
Believe in something greater than me without being able to see it
So fuck a watch, I wear my heart on my sleeve
Nobody knows my sorrow, nobody knows about the trouble I seen
A lot of dead niggas livin' through me, shawty, but not in the literal
Most 'em dead 'cause they ain't follow they dream
The power of a higher entity entered me
Mentally, physically, spiritually, I'm on a whole different energy
Fuck the world, but I need you to remember me
I had doubt in myself 'cause I used to fear that you would look at me differently
If I ever changed, I'm numb to it now, I don't feel the same
A slave to the feeling, I'm breaking the chains
Tryna balance out the joy, the pain, the sun, the rain
My life and the fame, done lost the game
The gift, the shame, my skin, my veins
My soul done rained so much on my heart
Really I don't know where to start
The irony of finding self in the dark
My nigga, truthfully, feel like it's two of me, I should've been on that ark
A love-hate relationship with my thoughts, I'm tryna shine in my own light
The realest nigga left in my own right
Helping you with your vices but can't seem to get a grip on my own life, yeah

[Omen:]
I was on my way down, breakdowns, breakthroughs
Spit up out my debut, gotta say I stay true
Maybe why I stayed broke, I been on a goose chase
Gotta swallow pride when they see me, how the truth taste?
Off the beaten path like Blueface
On the North Side, had to be a Tuesday
Walkin' slow with your kids on a school day
Way past midnight suddenly my mood change
That's when the truth came, in New York hearing rumors
My sister was homeless, convinced her to often
Been years since we talked, number changed
Saw you and my heart broke in a couple ways
I can't believe when I seen you, I knew shit was true
Stared in your eyes and I saw a different you
Skated off fast 'fore I could address it
Hope I ran into you 'fore we both get to Heaven

[St. Beauty:]
We might, we might
You opened up my eyes and helped me see the light
We might, we might
You opened up my eyes and helped me see the light, ayy

Yeah, hahahaha

Young nigga back from the dead
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Nigga almost lost his head, yeah
Gotta run, gotta fly, gotta float
Channels on top of the dresser
Baby, you down, need to bless up
Gotta watch how you address us
Playing no games, no dress-up
I got an idea
'Less you wildin' out in my hood, dawg ain't right here
Caption me as world nominated before I miss, yeah
Let the AK spray straight before I'm finished, yeah
As a monologue, talking to the fog, fuck a ho and miss, yeah

I make sacrifices, bloody sacrifices
Cutthroat, grab his toe, I suppose
Maybe that's what life is

Ayy, man, caveman
Two drink, cave in
Two blunt, ease up
Booyah, leaves up
Who care? Who there?
Do what? Wake up
The hell, happened
We want, hands up
Pay you, dare you
Motherfuck, motherfuck
Sister fucked, granny fucked
System, get some
Yeah, you, day two
Yeah, you, you, you
You a van, through the van
Stripper, good Lord
Top chi, not me
Boy, please, whatever
You next, to death
To go, ooh, oh
Who's that? Ring ring
Your number, bang bang
Callin' up, talk it up
Move over

I make sacrifices, bloody sacrifices
Cutthroat, grab his toe, I suppose

[Smino:]
Shit lookin' all red from the North with the power
It ain't Santa Claus
Brought my gifts to Atlanta, I'm Atlanta Claus
I can smell you pussy with the panties off, I
Been gettin' to the bread, tryna keep this shit low
But it ain't workin', my
Circle on fire like a circus now
Around the same niggas I been around, so
Of course I (Of course I), endorse my (Endorse my)
Reggie lil' nigga from the North Side (North Side)
It's astigmatism, you got poor sight (Poor sight)
Let the bitches forget it, I do it Alzheim'
Of course I (Of course I), I divorce my (Divorce my)
Opinion on advance when you walk past
(On bro, that shit groovy, I made it)
Niggas pull strings like a guitar, guitar, G-Star jeans on my sneakers
I'm a real soulful nigga, collared greens inside your sneakers (Yeah, yeah)
Ferguson days on Castro
Wasn't no cash flow
But I'm good for the always, I don't got the shows
I'm good for your whore, let me snatch your shone, shone, shone

[Johnny Venus:]
Bloody sacrifices

[Saba:]
Yeah, ayy
Look at what a motherfucker do for the cash and take
They'll be right across your head like it's Ash Wednesday
You got to just get off your ass like your ass is fake
You can't sit, and if we ain't siblings, then I can't relate
Today's shit, I'm Asic, I run shit, I got it jumpin' like pump fake
I don't need nothing but one take
I'm from the part of the city where young nigga keep him a nine like one plus eight
Our politician a fuckface
Corrupt like a Dogg Pound Gangsta
We do it like a small town wager
How I'm the dropout major
Success stories, I favor
Used to cover my scars, out here tryna cover The Fader
Yeah, Pro Tools, knobs, and the faders
Tail picks, as-salamu alaykum
You ain't 'bout static like AM radio, ain't even playin'
I put my heart and my all in my art, I'm alternate
All of them are the same, it's harder to tell 'em apart some days
I thought I'd call 'em out altogether
Rather than waste the amount of bars it'll take for me to call 'em out by name
Caught a glimpse of the alternate world I've introduced to you
Via the studio, got 'em studying our mixtape
I'm from the hood like my mama, put that on my mama
I lay the law down like parliament, all just with a pen and page

[Johnny Venus:]
I make sacrifices, bloody sacrifices

[J. Cole:]
You can't be everything to everybody
I wanna be your lover, your best friend
Your Batman, Spiderman
Fight to polish who and now your rival's in
I wanna damn near kill you to be the one that heal you up
I wanna be the one that feel you up
On nights when you need good dick to cheer you up
I wanna be the one to build you up
A wall worth five billion bucks to keep out the rah-rah
And the blah-blah-blah so nobody try to steal your thunder
Pull you under
Toss my hopes out, Royal Rumble
We done moved out to the boondocks
Built a big house, there he wonders
How somewhere along the way
He went from Huey to Eddie Wuncler
I been so disconnected, my perspective is ignorant
When you rich, niggas don't wanna correct you
Say something crazy, they won't interject
Do every drug that you want, they gon' let you
Dangerous when it's nobody to check you
I be havin' to check myself
Nigga, stop holding that money, you know you got plenty
I be havin' to spread my wealth
I used to be at the crib myself
7 years old, off of Red Boulevard
Where they bag up the raw
They gon' stand on the corner, one hand on they balls
And they ran when the cops come, there go the laws
Then I packed up a bag and I trapped it up north on the path of a star
And I ran into you like I met you before
Now damn, me and you goin' half on a boy, sing

[J. Cole:]
Huggin' the block, huggin' the block all day
I had nowhere to go, she gave me a place to stay
She gave me her heart to hold, I still got that shit to this day
She ridin' with me on the road, she ridin' with me in the A
Huggin' the block, huggin' the block, okay
She gave me the gift of my son, and plus we got one on the way
She gave me a family to love, for that, I can never repay
I'm crying while writing these words, the tears, they feel good on my face, hey

And yesterday could feel just like a waste, yeah
If I don't love you how I'm supposed to
And yesterday could feel just like a waste, yeah
If I don't love you how I'm supposed to

Babbling Babylon, brother, you ready for battle?

I think that's been spreading to my niggas (My niggas)
'Cause all that nigga ever do is smoke weed
And all he ever do is kill his liver (His liver)
I told my nigga to stop mixing that liquor
I told him it's only gonna make him sicker to kill you
Now hurry and pass me that fifth of tequila
'Cause I'ma kill it, come on, dawg, let me get it
Cozz is an idiot, I shouldn't hit raw, but I'm hittin' it (I'm hittin' it)
Lately, I've been using prayers for condoms
But I'm clean but my God is so awesome
Fuck you mean I ain't toppin' your roster?
Listerine, when I'm talking it's toxic, this hot shit
So when you start talking, don't get out of pocket
Like a bean or dolphin, we poppin', that's obvious

[Landstrip Chip:]
I been down so low, but I know it's my fault
I can feel it in my soul
I came up, this shit took off
All these thoughts in my head that I should've been shook off
Late nights layin' in my bed 'cause I know the mil's so close
I been down so low, but I know it's my fault

Ball from the Chi, not a carbon copy of Common
But respect dog, he's a G.O.A.T.
Got my own drip, dope bar on a coat
Follow my thesis
I just been tryna live decent
Dodging the precinct
Mindin' my P's & Q's

Acting reckless, I think I should get a check-up
Check-up, check-up
Niggas say I'm next up, fuck that, fuck that
Nigga, I'm the best out
I can't have these niggas treat me like a stepchild
Never graduated college but I'm set now
Thank God
This a living heaven
I think I'ma need a halo and some feathers
Dancin' with the devil, I should get a scepter
Mom and daddy always giving nigga lectures
Question, question, baby, what's your preference?
I can hit it from the side or you could ride it a little
Girl, I got a backstroke that's cold as the winter
I might make you breakfast but I'm never gonna take your ass to dinner

She climbed up Machu Picchu, lookin' for herself
But really found that does not limit what you could become

Lil' nigga with the broom finna brush you
Line a nigga up, fade cut you
Cut it out, you can't knock the hustle
'Cause when I bust I'm JaMarcus Russell
No Ryan Leaf, damn livin' hard, baby
Dyin' easy as dinosaurs, Mayan prophecies (Nah)
Michelangelo (Yeah), Maya Angelou, now I'm ramblin' (No, oh my God)
Take ya panties off and make a man in me (Yeah, yeah)
Thick and juicy booty like a manatee (Whoa)
Man, gun in my pants, roll up and I'ma defend (Ima' d-, I'ma d-)
Sayin', "You with your mans?"

[Vince Staples:]
Up, up, away
She love the way I run the play
To run the base, I'm up, I'm paid
The funds I make can break the bank (Facts)
I break ya face (Facts)
I bleed the block, you tweak, get shot
I bleed the block, you tweak, get shot
I bleed the block, you tweak, get shot
I bleed the block, you tweak, get shot (Ayy, ayy)

[Vince Staples:]
Pay me, run on ATL, I got Picassos in my crib (Uh-huh)

No Toronto, I got six (Uh-uh), big revolvers like I'm Clint (Uh-huh)
Dirty Harry, even granny keep it on her, Tyler Perry
Halle Berry, I might crash in the pussy for real (For real, for real)
Know they got to blow a bag when they book me for real (For real, for real)
Ain't nobody bigger than a body, Tookie got killed
Even Raymond got killed, so I stay with conceal (Boom)
Just made a order for a lawyer, bro'nem facin' appeal (Uh-huh)
My guy's a real upstandin' brother, on occasion he kills (Uh-huh)
We not actin', we don't need no activation for kills (Uh-huh)
I'll cut your onion, crush your muffin (Yeah, yeah)
I'm a gangsta like Grillz (Norf)

[Doctur Dot:]
I got a lightbulb over my head
Got a plot that I'm about to manifest
They should document a nigga followin'
A nigga hypnotizin' like I'm Simon Says
American Terrorist, homebred
Pull up, pop-pop-pop-pop, everybody dead
Playin' Boyz II Men to your thoughts and prayers
You don't even care, you don't believe in God
You got a Caesar cut, you ain't even, odd
I used to be the plug, now I'm supercharged
Cowabunga, Cucamonga Cracka Killa
No days off, can't do my job
12:34 or I catch the clock
On God, crack my ribs, tear my heart
Run the spades, hit the club
Pull your card, on the wave, rock the boat, Amistad
Hoppin' out the hotbox, now they outta pocket
Feel like 'Pac, what you can't get, I been unlockin'
If you ain't shit, you end up shot
Love your bitch but all that pillow-talkin' have you end up caught
Shut yo mouth, sayin' what you saw, that's a fatal flaw

[Vince Staples:]
Up, up, away
She love the way I run the play
To run the base, I'm up, I'm paid
The funds I make can break the bank (Facts)
I break ya face (Facts)
I bleed the block, you tweak, get shot
I bleed the block, you tweak, get shot
I bleed the block, you tweak, get shot
I bleed the block, you tweak, get shot

// No Chorus //

[Bas:]
Shit ain't got no chorus
I don't need no chorus
This bitch ain't got no chorus
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hardware, bear hide, I got thick skin
Stayed down like the pigskin on the yard marker
I'm the Godfather, better talk proper when you mention
Live wire, nigga, I fire like the Pistons
It got 12 V's and a stick shift
Bitch nigga, you get hit quick
Queens niggas, we get rich quick or die tryin'
Goin' for green with the nine iron
I get booked by the hour and time flyin'
I just took me a shower, 'cause I'm lyin'
'Round the dirty money, nigga, I'm Zion
Get up, there's no one as high as I am
The realest, you niggas is chicken shit
Pot fryin' when you pot-pie'ing
If my niggas ridin', then it's pop, pop
Nigga, that's word to my pop-pops
I came for the smoke like a hotbox
I came from the borough, I'm top spot
Got flows, now they want a photo when I rock shows
California in a 'Rari
California, that's the 'Rari

[Buddy:]
This shit ain't got no chorus
It ain't got no chorus
We don't need no chorus
You niggas is so

Ayy, four hundred hoes
All in a row, line 'em up
Hit 'em with the give-and-go
Bitch, you knew what it was when you signed up
I was on cruise control
Until I seen the police behind us
Tunnel vision, I put on my blinders
Had a good fuckin' run, but your time's up, yeah
I was smokin' on weed out in Babylon
Yes indeed-y, I got all my diamonds on
Your bitch wanted my dick, yeah, I ought've known
Boy, you crazy, you think that she comin' home
Gettin' money, I got me a bankroll
You cannot hit the blunt, I don't think so
Boy, I sit on the court at the Lake-Show
Shut the fuck up, bitch, it's not a sing-along

[Guapdad 4000:]
This shit ain't got no chorus
It ain't got no chorus
Ain't no chorus
Nigga, you so (It's a check), ayy

Your bitch watchin' my wrist stream like Vevo (Vevo)
I came from stealin' all the blockchains, nigga, I'm Deebo
Only rapper to make forty-five thousand off IG trolls
We both lit, but your shit don't hit, nigga, you a pre-roll
Learn somethin'
Ayy, money can't buy respect
But it can buy niggas who check those who disrespect
I been on a different check
I got a girl at home on tour, I need a different neck
Never third-wheelin' like a damn trike
I been in the mall with a scam stripe
I might need a wet wipe for when I touch niggas I don't like, yeah

[Bas (Dreezy):]
Shit ain't got no chorus
I don't need no chorus (Yeah, yeah)
Bitch ain't got no chorus (Ah, ah)
(Ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Dreezy:]
Got a body like Video Vixens
Peepin' the fake like a sixth sense
Got a couple K's I put up in the bank
But I need little more, word to Tristan
Drownin' in money, quicksand
I don't hear these bitches, long distance
Call me Big Dreeze, I don't fit in
Can't get in my section with a wristband
Floorin' it
Chasin' that bag 'til I corner it
That wax on the tree like an ornament
Yeah, this drip ain't in stores, gotta order it, yeah
With the G.O.A.T.'s now, I got high power
Lil' dog bitch like a Rottweiler
All that cap, what I'm blowin' a lot louder
I'ma give 'em that scold like a hot shower
I'm on top now, it's apparent
Pop your ass, I ain't talkin' parents
I was broke, used to shop clearance
Now I'm runnin' this shit like an errand
Ain't no comparin' us
Need me a thug nigga, ain't talkin' Jerrika
Me and the money got marital
Tom & Jerry, you a character
Pull up foreign and embarrass 'em

Is that the opening?
Do you feel anything yet?

// Disgusted //

Woo-ha
(Louie Ji the Wizard) Hush, ayy
Yeah (Shout out to Meez 'cause he noticed me, nigga)
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Cozz:]
I'm disgusted, she said she in love but it's nothin' we discussed yet
Says she love my hair and that shit growin' so luscious
And she wanna fuck but I know she fucked my cousin
Every time I think about you I say you disgustin'

[Childish Major:]
I'm disgusted, she said she in love and that wasn't the discussion
Told you from the jump intentions was all disgusting
I can't put my heart here but my dick here, know I'm hustlin'
Should've took it slow from the beginning, but you rushed it
Acting like you get it and you with it but you crushin'
Whole time I was hittin', claiming lusty but you lovin'
Now your ass alright, I seen a text, ain't even touch it
Feeling denied, you just a liar, I'm disgusted

[Cozz:]
I'm disgusted, thought that I would drown underwater but my lungs is
Made out of that gills, I prevail in the jungle
I ain't Uncle Phil but my will keep me comfortable
Searching for my deal, you would feel I'm accustomed to
Fake niggas and fake bitches
Who move to LA to suck dick and take pictures
With the same niggas that hate but hang with us
Girl you get gang banged, you don't hang with gang members

[Childish Major:]
I'm disgusted, straight here, violated by a later bitch, you busted
Confusing emotions with the fact I'm good at touchin'
Now you digging deeper for something realer than just fuckin'
Claim I was hiding feelings, yes I will, but I wasn't
Explainin' you still hear me, you chill, but it doesn't
Alicia keying cars 'cause she fallin', bitch, you clumsy
I'm just serving crack from house to house, I'm out here plumbing
She swear she the real, but no deal

[Cozz (Childish Major):]
I'm disgusted, she using her pussy for revenge, I'm disgusted
At least I shed that tear in a Benz, nigga fuck it
(Man and I got one tool but that's not what we discussin')
I never been a fool, you been knew I ain't trustin'
Made peace with her, there ain't a part of me that's fussin'
(Man, nigga, if you was up in my business, I ain't judgin')
(But, bruh, don't waste your time with hoes need attitude adjustin')
And never will I argue with a fool, that shit disgustin'

[Childish Major:]
Man, ain't finna sit here and argue with your ass
You know how this shit started
Talking bout you cool, you know, you know how it go
You on the same shit

[Cozz:]
These groupie hoes put a bad taste in my mouth
Lying hoes put a bad taste in my mouth
Attention whores put a bad taste in my mouth
Bald bitches put a bad taste in my mouth
Groupie hoes put a bad taste in my mouth
Lying hoes put a bad taste in my mouth
Attention whores put a bad taste in my mouth
Bald bitches put a bad taste in my mouth

// Revenge //

[Ari Lennox:]
Ooh-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey-yeah-yeah
Ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Hell yeah, yeah (Ayy-ayy)
Hell yeah
Hey-hey

[Doctur Dot:]
Who gon' find the lost souls?
In Atlanta shapeshifters and trolls, how did I get here?
My magic carpet unraveled (Woo)
You scroll through all the channels with your fraudulent financials
Blame your mama 'cause you started with hardstanders
We gon' pray on that (Oh Lord)
Always had my flow, I used to lay on that
You can say it face to face, facts
You no longer need it, make your way on back
You can't escape what you attract, or what you say on wax
Please don't overthink on that

[Childish Major:]
Like-like-like, like-like-like, like-like-like
Who gon' find that lost boy?
High class that she fall for him
Them whispers get lost and breezes got them whisper, man he call for me
CVS is hiring and when you drop your application, get some Halls for me
Coughin' hard, but ain't no need to get that coffin for me
Ain't nothin' serious, just it's cold and all the niggas on new levels
Got through locks so I'm past the codes, outchea tho
Queen City but no bitch on my roads
I'ma own that bitch though, can't front on my bill folds, sittin' on gold

[Ari Lennox:]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ayy-yee, yee (Ooh-ah, ooh-ah)
Ooh-ooh-woah, ooh-ah

[Lute:]
I used to look, down on myself
Like, what am I missin'?
Now I, go to the bank
Now they, talk to me different
Can you split that in 20's, hunnids, a couple 50's?
I used to get curved, now bitches DM they titties
Old friends turn to foes, can't bring fuck niggas with me like
Fuck it I'm ready to go, niggas be actin' like hoes
Bitches be tryna get chose, that's just the way that shit go
You can't complain if you broke, get you some money and clothes
I got some money with goals
I know I ain't perfect, barely worth it
Been an asshole lately but not on purpose, shit be on my mind
I look around like, "Damn, ain't nobody on my side"
But never question if I'm down to ride

[Omen:]
Tripped the hurdle but the ground I walk is fertile
Give you classic quotes just for kicks like Virgil
Look who in my circle
The ones that knew me when the nights was hurtful
Wins, I got a ton like Churchill
But what about the losses overcome, I wasn't Oprah's son
'Round my way they holdin' guns, I'm more like Roberson, I'm not a shooter
All I did was show love, like the Kamasutra
I was tryna find what's truer
I couldn't look inside the mirror
Tryna climb out my dilemmas
In the land of splendor, glamor, and some damaged women
Strappin' up, strappin' up, can't do no gamblin' with 'em
Shootin' high percentage, I been changin' my agenda
Finally came up out my shell, I ain't have no Master Splinter
Became the Top Chef, this another classic dinner
I fell down, came back, now that's a natural winner
Never could I pretend, nor ever would I surrender, yeah

[Ari Lennox:]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ayy-yee-yee (Ooh-ah, ooh-ah)
Ooh-ah (Ooh-ah)
Ooh-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ayy-yeah-yeah
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Ooh-ah
Ooh-ooh

[REASON:]
Look, I been speakin' for the misguided sons and the dead fathers
As I walk through the shadow of death, where we tread waters
Paint pictures of the stories forgotten, them dead authors
His blood gettin' mixed with that paint, so we dead artists
He told me, "Nigga, you better slide", you ain't said nada
Them niggas took my nigga, so fuck it, this lead karma
Struggle to pull the trigger as I did the tears fallin'
'Cause I know I let my mama down, she done raised all us
She gave up everything she had to keep our road straight
We ain't even have no room to have our own space
Look I gave everything I have to make my own way
And in three seconds I made a decision to let this clip off
This ain't even related, just some shit I had to get off
Repetition how we make decisions
'Cause my brother doin' life, and the judge done told him he would never get off
The struggle like hand me downs, nigga one size fits all
Woke up sweatin', panic with deep and breathin'
Goin' through deep depression, wonderin' why I chose to live
And the way with my freedom indecisive, it's on the fence
When I been blessed with rappin', no wonder they call it gifts
Got up from that bed, picked up the phone like, "What I missed?"
Got a call from some Dreamers, said that they was out for revenge
Excited then I thought about it, and started crying 'cause a year ago my cousin was killed searchin' for his, yeah

// Still Dreamin //

[JID (Ari Lennox):]
Still screaming, yeah, still scheming, yeah (Yeah)
Still dreaming, yeah (Yeah, oh yeah, yeah)
Still screaming, yeah, still scheming, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Still dreaming, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[JID:]
If you ever want for anything to work, you gotta try
You gotta live like you dying in a minute, take your time
Use it wise, dream higher than "The Ribbon in the sky"
Don't gotta take my advice, you know, who the fuck am I? (Yeah, who the fuck are you?)
But just a little fly, finding smells through a shitty walk of life
Or Walter Payton on the sideline, the pie line is mine
In my mind, I try to see myself through God eyes
Fuck a guideline or tour guide, nobody helped me, but I'm not fine
God got me, but if not, then this nine got me
Nah, Akhi, this bird shit, you pop cocky
I gotta get the mop, they tryna leave the boy sloppy
Slip once then it's my fault, second time, then you got me fucked up
Tried ending it and knock me off my rocker, tough luck
Kick my ass, let me run it back, that was tough love I was raised on
Bad kid hittin' chained dogs with the acorns, East Atlanta playboy

[JID (Ari Lennox):]
Still screaming, yeah, still scheming, yeah (Yeah)
Still dreaming, yeah (Yeah, oh yeah, yeah)
Still screaming, yeah, still scheming, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Still dreaming, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[6LACK:]
It's about to be five, I gotta grab Syx at seven o'clock
Hopped on a plane, then in a drop
I stick a car seat inside of a car that it ain't supposed to be in
Young, black king ducking the hoes in my DM's
I was cruising down Moreland couple years ago
I was broke, but I knew blood, sweat, and tears, you know?
I thought I knew it all but I didn't know a thing
Ain't scared of the cold, bitch, I got ice in my veins
I looked up to God, she look up to me, smile, thumbs up, right on
How I'm supposed to slide when my check engine light on?
Bought a whole crib long way from Double Trees
Nickname her Chanel and I love her double C's
JID told me, "Get 'em," I said, "It's gon' be a breeze"
Talk slick shit 'cause I got VV's in my teeth
I took us from EBT to Amex (Right spot)
From dreams of BET to the Grammys (Yeah)

[JID (Ari Lennox):]
Still screaming, yeah, still scheming, yeah (Yeah)
Still dreaming, yeah (Yeah, oh yeah, yeah)
Still screaming, yeah, still scheming, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Still dreaming, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Lute (Ari Lennox):]
You hold me down like four flats
Let me drive the 'Lac to get some food, couldn't pay you back
Though I offer gas money every time, you say take it back
Heard word around town that you been askin' 'bout me
But that's surprisin' 'cause last time we spoke
You told me life was better off without me
Damn, that's deep, cut me deep
I let the pain seep 'cause that makes for good music
It don't hurt to check to see how you doin'
You watch my stories, so you know how I'm doin'
Don't be no ghost, watching all my posts but don't like a picture
Swear, I miss you but it's yo' fault that a nigga ain't with you
See, we had plans, sell my two-seater for a sedan
Call your daddy just to ask for your hand
But you was playin' (Yeah, yeah)

[JID (Ari Lennox):]
Still screaming, yeah, still scheming, yeah (Yeah)
Still dreaming, yeah (Yeah, oh yeah, yeah)
Still screaming, yeah, still scheming, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Still dreaming, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Still dreaming
