// Lights Please //

Uh
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

[Verse One]
I had this little bad thing somethin' like them 10's
She gave a nigga mad brain somethin' like the wiz
But you see the sad thing fuckin' with her is
Is the chick ain't even have brains dummy like a bitch
So I tried to show her
About the world and about just who we really are
And where we've come and how we still have to go really far
Like baby look at how we live broke on the boulevard
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
Then all I really want is for her to go down low
Before you know it she wet enough to get drowned slow
And all that deep shit I was previously down for
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down for
You see I peeped it, pussy is power
That proud feelin' we get knowin' that pussy is ours
And how it feels to feel that feelin' you feelin' when you be drillin' that shit
Got her sayin' you be killin' that shit
And all the pain the world cause
She be healin' that shit
And nah that ain't your girl dog
But you be feelin' that chick
And you just wanna tell her everything she might need
But in the mean time it's lights please

[Hook]
Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights
For now everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
Feelin' like things gon' be alright

Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights
For now everything just seems so right
And how you make the darkness seem so bright
Feelin' like things gon' be alright
Lights please

[Verse Two]
So now we in the hotel
Mirrors on the ceilin'
She say she wanna blow L's
I hear her and I'm willin'
But everytime I smoke well a nigga mind gone
So that every word I spoke well I'm tryin' to put her on
But she couldn't hear me
I told her all about how we been livin' a lie
And that they'd love to see us all go to prison or die
Like baby look at how they show us on the TV screen
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
Then all I really want is for her to get on top
Before you know it she workin' jerkin' it non stop
And all that next shit I was previously talkin'
Is now that wet shit that I'm currently lost in
And while that sweat drip I am reminded
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin'
I'm findin' the more I grow the more y'all seem to stay the same
Don't even know the rules but yet y'all tryin' to play the game
And ain't it shameful how niggas blame hoes for givin' birth
To a baby that took two to make
Coward nigga you a fake
How gon' look in your sons face and turn your back
Then go start another family dog what type of shit is that?
She said it's okay
Rubbed my head and told me to relax
Laid a nigga down proper like she was recordin' tracks
Said I know you wanna change the world
But for the night please
Just reach over and hit the lights please

[Hook]
Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights
For now everything just seems so right
And how you make darkness seem so bright
Feelin' like things gon' be alright

Lights please
Lights please
Turn off the lights
For now everything just seems so right
And how you make darkness seem so bright
Feelin' like things gon' be alright
Lights please

[Outro]
Uh uh uh
Lights please
Uh uh uh
Lights please
Uh uh uh
Lights please
Turn off the lights
Lights Please
Yeah
That's it

// In The Morning //

[J. Cole]
Baby you summertime fine, I let you get on top, I be the underline
I'm trying to get beside you like the number 9, dime
You fine as hell, I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wondering what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman
Would you drink with a nigga, do you smoke weed
Don't be ashamed, it aint no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
Its only fitting cause I'm looking super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do something to me
cause girl I caught the vibe like you threw something to me
So i threw em back, now all my niggas hollerin, who was that
Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you bout do with that
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine

[Chorus]
And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
The sun rising while you moanin'

And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
And can I hit it in the morning
The sun rising while you moanin'

[Drake]
Uh, baby you winter time cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
I'm trying to make the goose bumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work,
I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love thick women cause my aunt, she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get those kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm joking, I mean that thing is poking
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provoking
I got bath water that you can soak in
Things I could do with lotion
Dont need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gon' love it
Yeah, when lights coming through the drapes and we both yawning
I roll over and ask if..

[Chorus - Drake]

[J. Cole]
Hey, hey, God Bless the child that can hold his own
God Bless the woman that can hold patron
God Bless the homegirl that drove us home
No strings attached, like a cordless phone
You see my intentions with you is clear
I'm learning not to judge a woman by the shit that she wears
Therefore, you shouldnt judge a nigga off of the shit that you hear
Get all defensive, apprehensive, all because my career
To be fair, I know we barely know each other and yeah
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headin from here
Just say you're scared if you're scared but if you through frontin' we can do somethin
And you know just what I'm talking about, tomorrow you'll be calling out
Cause tonight we getting right into the wee morn'
Cooking nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward
Then I go my own way and you think about me all day, thats just a warning

[Chorus]

// Dollar And A Dream III //

Yeah, hey, Cole World

[Hook]
I got a dollar and a dream
That's all a nigga got
So if it's bout that cream
Then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream
Just a dollar and a dream

[Verse 1]
Walk with a nigga, I give you my pain
So much on my mind I wonder how it fit in my brain
Scattered thoughts, dark secrets lead me to a blacker heart
Life can't get any worse, Stevie with his glasses off
Cause I still don't see hope, lookin' for a quick fix
When everyone I see is broke, get lost in weed smoke
Knowing it make it worse, thoughts roam uncontrollably
Barely trustin' niggas, over a decade they been knowin' me
Shit, life at the bottom, nobody but God got em
They say he wouldn't leave me yet I'm fallin' like it's Autumn
Tell me, what do you do just when you're on your last dollar
And the stress and this mess you're in can make your ass holla?
Do you fold, grow bitter and grow cold?
No longer fightin' now the only thing you grow is old
Or do you flip that fuckin' dollar to a dream?
Whether a scholar or a fiend, watch a pawn become a king
Cole!

Young nigga with his jeans low
Nice guy just got a mean flow
Never seen rich but he's seen po'
Mr Dolla and a Dream in case you ain't know

[Hook]
That's all a nigga got
So if it's bout that cream
Then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream
Just a dollar and a dream

[Verse 2]
Yeah, armed and ready, you niggas strung out, you spaghetti
You paper, confetti, small time, y'all on one, I'm on mine
You logged off cause I'm online, small talk from small minds
I wanna buy the mall but there ain't shit in this small town
This where I get my dough
My niggas make sure the money right and then I rip the show
I run the town they tried to call me underground
I spun around like, you wish
Homie my backpack Louis, now watch just how I do this
I got the nerds rappin' hard shit, dummies rappin' smart shit
Mozart meets Humphrey Bogart with this from the heart shit
Play your part, life is but a dream for me
I get a flash of nightmares where niggas scheme on me
It's hard to see my enemies; who infiltrated my team?
I take a step back and notice that things ain't what they seem
That's when a nigga refocus, yeah I turn on them high beams
I got that red dot waitin', I'm wastin' your whole regime
I wish a nigga would, boy you can't out-smart me
I let you feel like you the shit, but boy you can't out-fart me
You never, have it, I know you want what I got
But nigga you ain't me, but you are what I'm not
And that's a phony ass, lonely ass, Cole is what you know me as
But we far from homies, if you know my mama, you know me
If you don't then well I'm sorry, you should get to know Kay
Man she been workin' too hard, I should send her a bouquet
My goal this year is a real one, gonna stack a million
And as soon as I do, mama that 9 to 5 is through
And I know I ain't been callin', but I'm thinkin' bout you
And all the shit that you been through
My girl and then my brother too
Cause this life get hard on this road, yeah it's true
I don't never tell you how much I be stressin', but I do
But I suck it up for who? My fans, and my mans
Who probably never ever had this type of lifestyle in they plans
Hoppin' in and out of vans, on the buses, on the planes
Gettin' brain from a bitch and thinkin' "God damn, what's her name?"
Sometimes I just shake my head and tell myself this is a shame
And then my other side kick in like "Bitch don't be so fuckin' lame"
Dang, what a life, another day, another night
At times this shit is all blurry, pray and hope that God heard me
Just for those praying for me, man I know that y'all worry
But I ain't never failed and you can bet I never will
Cole!

Young nigga with his jeans low
Nice guy just got a mean flow
Never seen rich but he's seen po'
Mr Dolla and a Dream in case you ain't know

[Hook]
That's all a nigga got
So if it's bout that cream
Then I'm all up in the spot
I got a dollar and a dream
Just a dollar and a dream

[Outro]
Hey
Cause nigga that's life, and trust me I'm livin'
Look what a nigga made out the shit that I was given
Look what a nigga made out
Look what a nigga made out
Got a dollar and a dream

// Can't Get Enough //

(I need that) Cole World
(I need that) Southside
Can't get enough, can't get enough
(I need that) Eastside, Westside, worldwide
Ride out

Now, I ain't got no kids yet, but this right here's for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet
But that's how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter
Probably make a gay nigga reconsider
You now rockin' with the best, mane
Dress game down to the sex game
Won't brag, but the boy been blessed, mane
Let you play with the stick; Ovechkin
She callin', she textin', she's fallin', but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl
'Cause a nigga don't play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain't coming off of my last name
'Cause I really can't take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit
Your homegirl saying, "He a bad boy."
But I'm signed to the Roc
No time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids!

[Trey Songz:]
She said "I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good
And everybody knows
My home girls tried to warn me
They tried to let me know
But what you got, I need a lot
So I can't let you go"

[J. Cole:]
She said
"I, can't get enough, can't get enough"
(I need that)
"I, can't get enough, can't get enough"
(I need that)
"I can't get enough of what you got
Good god, you hit the spot
Tried to let go but I just could not
So don't you stop, I need that"

Hey, Globetrotter, Cole hotter, either way, out in London town
Hoes holla 'cause they love my sound, and I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that'll cut all night, that'll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight, tryna get my last lil' nut, all right?
She be down for whatever, whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight, on the grind tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head, I hate it when you give me headaches

[Trey Songz:]
She said "I heard you got a main chick
A mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good
And everybody knows
My home girls tried to warn me

But what you got, I need a lot

She said
"I, can't get enough, can't get enough"
(I need that)

(I need that)
"I can't get enough of what you got
Good god, you hit the spot
Tried to let go but I just could not
So don't you stop, I need that"

Hey, Cole World, baby, ain't nothin' sunny
I see 'em hatin', but it ain't nuttin' to me
I'm from the Ville, where they bang for the money
And carry fo'-fives like change for a twenty
So what I look like scarred?
Them niggas over there look like nerds
Never mind that, girl, let's make a track
I'll beat the pussy up, that's the hook right thurr
That's the hook, right there
There's the hook, right there
Never mind that, girl, let's make a track
I'll beat the pussy up, that's the hook right thurr

// Interlude //

I'm drivin', nigga as soon as I get the text we all in the car like 'ahh, yeah nigga, we outta here nigga, yeah nigga! So we goin' crazy. We goin' crazy as fuck, we like super excited. Dog, ten seconds later, all I see in the back and hear is 'woop woop' blue lights right behind me, the fuckin undercover car, of all things. So I'm like fuck. I knew right away what it was. Dog, for the, for two and a half maybe three years before that, in New York, I was drivin dirty, my license was no good. Dog, how bout the moment I found out I was gonna the deal a fuckin cop got behind me and I already knew what it was. I handled it so like, I handled it the best way the best way you could ever go to jail like I went to jail knowin bitch like, ah know what I'm sayin? I'm in there dog, spendin the night in jail realizin like these niggas have no clue bitch I'm about to sign this. [laughs] That was the easiest night in jail a nigga could ever do son.

// Sideline Story //

[Verse 1:]
I put my heart and soul in this game, I'm feelin' drained
Unappreciated, unalleviated
Tired of comin' up short, fuck abbreviated
Want my whole name spelled out, my own pain spilled out
No pain, no gain, I blow brains, Cobain
Throw flames, Liu Kang, the coach ain't help out, so I call my own shots
I'm David Blaine, I'm breakin' out of my own box, you stay the same
But homie if you change, may you change for the better
Back when Martin King had a thing for Coretta
Wonder if she seen all the dreams he was dreamin'
Did she have a clue of all the schemes he was schemin'
Still loved him just enough to put up with the cheatin'
Months go by and only see him for a weekend
I say a prayer, hope my girl ain't leavin'
We all got angels, we all got demons
As you fall through the club
Bad bitches down to do all the above
Money comes fast so bein' hungry don't last
Till you look in the mirror and you saw who you was
Cole World, it couldn't be more clearer
The time is now, couldn't be more herer
My reign gonna last like 3-4 eras
Say hello to the real, I can be your hero

[Hook:]
Hey, I'mma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more
You thinking I'mma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

[Verse 2:]
Up in 1st class, laugh even though it's not funny
See a white man wonder how the fuck I got money
While he sit at coach, hate to see me walk past 'im
Young black pants sag, headphones blastin'
Know what he askin', "how did he manage?"
"With all the cards against him, he used them to his advantage!"
Slang we be speakin' probably soundin' like Spanish
Then I fuck they heads up when a nigga show manners
Some New York niggas thought it was funny callin' us 'Bama
Laughin' at the grammar cause they didn't understand us
Must've thought we slow, but little do they know
I came up in here to take advantage of that shit y'all take for granted
Opportunity that I would kill for
Lookin' at rappers like "what the fuck you got a deal for?!"
When I was assed out with my funds low
It's nice to know I had the whole world at my front door

[Hook:]
Hey, I'mma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more
You thinking I'mma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

[Verse 3:]
I made it to the rack, even though they tried to box me out
I got the key to the game, they tried to lock me out
But what they don't understand is this is all plan
It's a bigger picture and you can't photoshop me out
Some nigga ask me why Jay never shout me out
Like I'm supposed to give a fuck
Don't you know that I be out in France
Where the fans throw they hands like Pacquiao
Not cause my looks, cause my hooks could knock Rocky out
And my lines is designed from the heart
Young Simba been a lion from the start
Dumb nigga's, y'all been lyin from the start
My life's like a movie, truly
And these niggas is dyin' for the part
But, you'll never play me like LeBron vs. Jordan
Twenty years, wonder who they gone say was more important
Both changed the game, came through and made a lane
Who's to say that who's greater, all we know, they ain't the same

[Hook:]
Hey, I'mma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I promise baby, you can bet the bank on me
Cause can't nobody tell me what I ain't gonna be no more
You thinking I'mma fall, don't be so sure
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines

// Mr. Nice Watch //

Yeah, everybody got a bad side
Drop, let me see that shit
What you say Cole ain't hot? What!
Where you read that shit?
You believe that shit?
All cause some lame nigga tweet that shit
Have you seen my shows, have you seen my hoes?
If I wasn't hot would they be so thick?
Guess not, got the game in a headlock
I'm blasting at, I'm laughing at you old niggas, Redd Foxx
Don't mind me boy, I'm red hot
Umm nigga, they not,

I'm everywhere they not
(I said)
You'll never play me, nice try
Ballin' in the night spot
No more Mr Nice guy, hello Mr Nice watch
You don't want no problems, put yourself in a tight spot so
You can look but don't touch
I'll stay on my toes like them White Sox

[Hook:]
Cause it cost me a lot
My chain and my watch
They say time is money, but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, than time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no you can make that back so
Let's ball while we here
Let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
Like I'll make that back, fuck it I'll make that back
Go

Nice watch
Nice watch (I know)
Nice watch
No more Mr Nice Guy, hello Mr Nice Watch

Stack on black, I ain't never been a high roller
Now it's racks on racks
Never thought that I would ride Rover
But I'm back on track, add to the fact that I never really drive sober
Cole World but I'm hot as shit
Do that mean that I'm Bi-polar?
Young black and gifted, I rap like it's Christmas eve
Coach wouldn't let him off the bench, no wonder why they quit the team
But, I'm cut from a different sleeve
Cole World so the wrist'll freeze
Hurry up with your pictures please
I gotta make history

[Hook:]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
They say time is money, but really it's not
If we ever go broke girl, than time is all we got
And you can't make that back, no you can't make that back so
Let's ball while we here
Let's ball while we here
Like ain't no tomorrow, like ain't no next year
Drink away all our problems, make it rain with no care
Like I'll make that back, fuck it I'll make that back
Go

Nice watch
Nice watch (I know)
Nice watch
No more Mr Nice Guy, hello Mr Nice Watch

[Jay-Z:]

Cocksucka I'm 7.30, y'all know where you'll niggas gon wind up
No more Mr Nice Guy, hello Mr Nice Watch
Only but a matter of time 'fore I hit ya'll niggas with the nice shot
Y'all niggas, better not call the law
Get no blood on my Audemar
Meaning ya'll better not waste my time
When y'all ready I'll take you all to war
Meanwhile I'm just chopping off doors
Put the front on the back cause I'm back and forth
Put the front on the back of the 'bach like a boss
So I fronting on niggas when I'm backing off
Uh, what up Cole, It's your time
Let these niggas know
Adjust ya Roley's on these muthafucking hoes
Whenever you ready, go!

[Hook:]
It cost me a lot, my chain and my watch
If we ever go broke, girl, then time is all we got
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)

// Cole World //

[Intro:]
I think it's gonna be a hell of a night, a hell of a night
So we could do whatever you like, hey hey

[Verse 1:]
It took me all day to find some inspiration
It just hit me like a ton of bricks, no renovation
Problem with the game now, it ain't no innovation
I see my shit all in your shit, we call that imitation
And they say that's flattering, but I ain't flattered at all
Matter fact y'all need to practice that more
See my man Nate asked me if I gained weight
I said nah, my pockets got fatter, that's all
Money was an issue, but now that that's solved
I ball, I ball, like Kobe in the fall
Put trophies on my wall, rather trophies on my mantle
Dog my shows be off the handle, take the proceeds go to gamble
Ha! Bet it on black and pray, I quadruple my salary
If I win, maybe then I could pay Sallie Mae
Told her I be dealin' with some real-life shit
She be askin' "When?", bitch, when I feel like it

[Hook:]
Cole World, Cole Life, Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy

I got what you need right here, right here
I got what you need right here, right here
I got what you need right here, right here
I got what you need right here, right here

[Verse 2:]
Uh, turn up the 808's for me
Back when I was starvin' no one made a plate for me
Now I do it big and that's my day to day story
I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry
bitch I made this in the crib watchin' Belly
Eatin' peanut butter jelly, what the fuck the niggas tell me
They say I'm takin' long, I tell em patience is a virtue
I'm goin' all out and bitch I never had a curfew
See when you're spittin' so real
Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal
Got em feelin' like my niggas when they lose, they appeal
Then it's back to the cell, back to the hell
At times I watch the news and see they talkin' 'bout diplomacy
And they ain't got a clue my niggas ain't got they diplomas, see
Rappers show me love, I wonder what it could be
I think they scared of me, and they should be

[Hook:]
Cole World, Cole Life, Cole Blooded
I be on my shit, and look at, all the hoes love it
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin' at me
How that feel? Very happy

I got what you need right here, right here
I got what you need right here, right here
I got what you need right here, right here
I got what you need right here, right here

[Outro:]
Come pull me outta here
I think it's safe to say we outta here
We outta here
I think it's safe to say we outta here

I think it's gonna be a hell of a night, a hell of a night
So we could do whatever you like, hey

// Lost Ones //

[Verse 1]
Baby girl, I can't imagine what it's like for you
I got you pregnant now inside there is a life in you
I know you wonderin' if this is gon make me think bout wifing you
Like if you had my first child would I spend my whole life with you
Now I aint tryna pick a fight with you, I'm tryna talk
Now I aint tryna spend the night with you
I'm kinda lost see
I've been giving it some thought lately and frankly
I'm feelin' like we aint ready and it's… hold up now
Let me finish
Think about it baby me and you we still kids ourself
How we gon raise a kid by ourself?
Handle biz by ourself
A nigga barely over 20, where the hell we gon live?
Where am I gon get that money
I refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world
When I aint got shit to give 'em
And I'm not with them niggas who be knocking girls up and skate out
Girl, you gotta think bout how the options weigh out
What's the way out?

[Chorus]
And I ain't too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And girl I know it hurt but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work but I doubt it
And I aint too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And girl I know it hurt but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work but I doubt it

[Verse 2]
She said nigga you got the nerve
To come up to me talkin' bout abortion
This my body nigga so don't think you finna force shit
See I knew that this is how you act, so typical
Said you love me, oh, but now you flipping like reciprocals
It figures though, should've known that you was just another nigga
No different from them other niggas
Who be claiming that they love you just to get up in them draws
Knowing all the right things to say
I let you hit it raw mothafucker
Now I'm pregnant you don't wanna get involved muthafucker
Tryna take away a life, is you God mothafucker?
I don't think so
This a new life up in my stomach
Regardless if I'm your wife
This new life here I'mma love it
I ain't budging, I'll do this by my muthafucking self
See my momma raised me without no muthafucking help from a man
But I still don't understand how you could say that
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back
Bout your father and you told me that you hate that nigga
Talkin' bout he a coward and you so glad that you aint that nigga
Cause he left your mamma when she had you and he ain't shit
And here you go doin' the same shit
You ain't shit nigga!

[Chorus]
And I aint too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And boy that shit hurt
And aint nobody perfect, still we can make it work but you doubt it
Now, I aint too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And boy that shit hurt
And aint nobody perfect, still we can make it work but you doubt it

[Verse 3]
They say everything happens for a reason
And people change like the seasons
They grow apart she wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her
He spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her
Now she wide open
She put a ring up on his finger if she could
But he loved her cause the pussy good
But she aint no wife though
Uh oh, she tellin' him she missed her period like typo's
He panicking, froze up like a mannequin
A life grows inside her now he asking "is it even mine"
What if this bitch aint even pregnant dawg
Could she be lying?
And she be crying cause he acting distant
Like ever since I told you this nigga you acting different
And all his niggas saying man these hoes be trapping niggas
Playing with niggas emotions like they some action figures
Swear they get pregnant for collateral
It's like extortion, man if that bitch really pregnant
Tell her get an abortion
Uh, but what about your seed nigga?
(What about your seed nigga?)

And I aint too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it
And I aint too proud to tell ya that I cry sometimes
I cry sometimes about it

// Nobody's Perfect //

[J. Cole:]
This is for all the fans that waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated, look mama, we made it
Your son out in Barbados, cheese eggs and potatoes
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like Plato
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' about girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls and vandalizin' her curls
Sweating her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I step over piranha, death over dishonor
They killing niggas for J's, that's death over designer
Hey Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over D'wana
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue about the same thing
Tell me why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing?
Well

[Missy Elliott:]
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect ey, ey
But you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect ey
But you're perfect for me

We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat, Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Baby I love to call your name, name, name

[J. Cole:]
Oh yeah, to my college girl, take the weekend off and come home soon
I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin' all in your dorm room
But that thing tight like Fort Knox
So I call you when the tour stops
But baby where your roommates, did you make sure the door's locked?
She love it when we get together
Smoke a little weed but her shit together
Now that I'm on, I can pick and choose
Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose
Yeah, I heard the stories about different dudes
Her man on campus but it's fine by me
She say she only fucked like 4-5 niggas
So you know you gotta multiply by 3

[Missy Elliott:]
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect ey, ey
But you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, nobody's perfect ey
But you're perfect for me

We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat, Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Baby I love to call your name, name, name

// Never Told //

Yeah... hey, wassup girl

[Verse 1:]
Uh, angel eyes, long hair
I see you cryin', what's wrong there
He did what? He fucked who?
We know the story, what's new?
See I could probably, rush you
Tell you that he should have loved you
Take advantage, fuck you
Tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do
But the truth is, we all the same
On different teams, but it's all a game
The objective, tryna score
You got a wife, you find a whore
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers
Pull up her pants, you find the door
You drive her home, she mop you off
You bust again, and drop her off
Then repeat like an episode
Why we cheat? I'll never know
Is it cause we rap? Heavens no
Lotta niggas rap though, never blow
A heterosexual, girl you fine, from head to toe
Could it be cause my father let me know
That he cheated, and somehow I never told
I never told

"Hey, you wanna be a man?
Yeah I wanna be a man
A man don't run and tell his mama everything he see
I ain't gonna tell
Alright, alright then man. Be a man then..."

[Verse 2:]
OK, that's what it is, I see the game
The hoes come, the seasons change
The hoes go, we rearrange
Fuck up her life, she'll never be the same
The old G's that beat the game
Forever young, Peter Pan
35, still playin', child support, still payin'
Jugglin', bill payin'
Been runnin' round, field dayin'
Wine and dine, meal payin'
With hopes that she'll land
The bed and, get wet then, give head then
You bet man, the same girl who said we just met man
Game colder than the fuckin' dead man
One night stands, no best man
No bridesmaids, or reverends
Cause Wolverine's depressin', don't wanna be your ex man
Cause cupid aims and throw the darts
There go the sparks and broken hearts
Who wanna build Noah's Ark
Just to have that shit torn apart

"You know what? I need to talk to you
About what?
I don't think this is, working out for us
Why?
I mean, I need some space. I mean no, I just wanna find myself, that's all
What the fuck?!"

// Rise And Shine //

[Intro: Jay-Z]
There's a nigga right now somewhere
He at the table with a bowl of Apple Jacks
And he's reading the back of the cereal
And in between eating the Apple Jacks he's writing some shit
And he wants my spot
I'mma find him though, I'mma sign him..
I don't want no problems

[J. Cole:]
Like we always do at this time, Cole blowin' your mind
Hey dummy, this no accident, all of this was designed
Took my time, crept from behind
And I opened up your blinds, rise and shine, Cole World
Same nigga used to drive around with yo girl
In my mama's Civic, now I'm out here tryna get it
I ain't like you lame ass niggas, boy I spit it how I live it
So when you see me in the streets, man I ain't got a mimic
Cause I ain't got an image to uphold, this real shit
I ain't got a gimmick I just flow and niggas went nuts for
The boy that set fire to the booth
In a game full of liars it turns out that I'm the truth
Some say that rap's alive, it turns out that I'm the proof
Cause the ones y'all thought would save the day can't even tie my boots
The ones y'all thought could hang with me can't even tie my noose
Let these words be my bullets nigga, I don't rhyme I shoot, bang!

Before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take

Lord I been dreamin' bout the paper, get rich 'fore I see my life taper
Hope my mama get to see Jamaica before she meet her maker
I hoop was never good enough to ever be a Laker
But these words I record got me ballin', Jordan
More than a rapper this a natural disaster
Boy, I'm meaner than Katrina mixed with Gina, "Shut up, Cole!"
This is for my niggas back home, homes, what up, bo?
This is for the bitches that played me, what up, ho?
Nah I ain't mad, it's sad, you went from bad to real bad
Two kids that don't even know their real dad
Real sad, baby girl I wish you still had it
Then maybe you could get a taste of livin' Villematic
Is Cole still at it? Y'all be talkin' about the same shit
That's how I feel about it, mama was a real addict
That's why I don't respect that lyin' ass white shit you talkin'
Cole's planning funerals, you might fit the coffin

Before I wake
I pray to the Lord, my soul to take

Get on your job lil mane, this ain't Saturday
We in two different lanes, you can't navigate
We in two different games, you playin' patty cake
Brother you're lame, you're Shane Battier
You out of shape, my mind run a mile a minute
The sky's the limit, I'm so high, I'm divin' in it
My rides is tinted, my knob's gettin' slobbed up in it
She hollerin' God, man you would've thought that God was in it
But it's just a nigga God invented
The best out, foolish pride'll make you not admit it
But if this shit ain't fire nigga, why you noddin' with it?
The hate in your blood can't stop your soul from vibin' with it
Now you all conflicted cause my flows is wicked
And my hoes is thicker and all of yours is pickin' me
Cause they know a star when they see a star, nigga
Ain't even got to fuck him to know he a raw nigga
I got her in my bedroom, but cheer up, nigga
You saved so many hoes, you a hero, nigga!
Medal of honor, I'm feelin' on top like Pac
When he slept with Madonna, hey, this is death before dishonor
Get arrested and forget to tell my mama
She got enough to stress about, my niggas gonna get me out
Then we hit the club with the thugs and the liquors
No criminal record but I'm makin' criminal records
Isn't it ironic? Isn't it iconic?
Jacket so expensive you wouldn't even try on it
But it fit me perfect, I purchase it if I want it
The city on my shoulder, so no girl, you can't cry on it
When you make a list of the greatest aye, am I on it?
Maybe not yet but bitch I got the clock set
It goes tick-tock, game on lock
Son gon' shine but the reign won't stop, oh no

If I should die before I wake
I pray to the Lord my soul to take
My soul to take, my soul to take

// God's Gift //

Up up and away...
Do you trust me...
Would you love me...
Then it must be...

[Verse 1:]
Worldwide stunner, oh man, I'm a
Reign on the game, make it storm and thunder
Grab an umbrella bitch, and go stand under
And bundle up, it's gonna be a cold ass summer
You niggas so last summer
Onto the new, on-on to the new shit
Jigga wouldn't even take my CD when he seen me
Two years later bitch we made it on, on to the Blueprint
Now how's that for persistence
Cole World comin', call back up assistance
Same broads, used to hang up on my walls
Now they come up out their drawers, how's that for a mistress
Hell bent, heaven sent, Lord I repent if I ever sinned
Now I know I ain't the richest, but I still wanna ball
Put money over bitches but we still underdogs

[Hook:]
Did you miss me?
No I don't know where I'm goin', but I'm goin', now is you comin' with me?
Up, up and away, hey, do you trust me?
If I was on my last dollar, dead broke, assed out, would you love me?
Then it must be a match made in heaven
God's Gift
God's Gift
God's Gift
Motherfucker this is God's gift

[Verse 2:]
Pussy my passion
Man I just can't help it I see a cookie, I grab one
Lookin' for some nookie, I'm tryna scoop me a bad one
Every verse I spit it just like it could be my last one
Ever since I got on
I've been on a mission to fuck the bitches I missed out on
Ex-cheerleader hollerin' what's up
Now her nigga beat her, now that's fucked up
What type of little fuck boy hit a
Woman, bet he wouldn't put his hands on a nigga
I ain't bitter boy that's all you
Plus I just fucked her 'fore she called you
Dry your eyes baby, I'll drive you home
Older hoes sayin', my how you've grown
I came up, fucked the game up
Show my momma I'll survive on my own

[Hook:]
Did you miss me?
No I don't know where I'm goin', but I'm goin', now is you comin' with me?
Up, up and away, hey, do you trust me?
If I was on my last dollar, dead broke, assed out, would you love me?
Then it must be a match made in heaven
God's Gift
God's Gift
God's Gift
Motherfucker this is God's gift

// Breakdown //

[Verse 1:]
Look, I just shed tears homie and now I ain't too proud to admit it
Just seen my father for the first time in a minute
And when I say a minute I mean years man
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam
Cause as I left them I reflected on my younger days
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played
Father, cause no other man bothered
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical
But I accepted it cause I ain't know no better
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta
So many things you could have told me
And saved me the trouble of lettin' my mistakes show me
I feel like you barely know me
And that's a shame cause our last name is the same
That blood type flowin' through our veins is the same
My mama left you and maybe your anger's to blame
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth
And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury
Maybe I should be tellin' you fuck you cause you selfish
But I want a father so bad, I can't help it

I break down, I break down
Can't help but break down
I break down

[Verse 2:]
I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit man
It's fuckin' with her body, now she sick damn
I wanted a big house with a white picket fence and a pool
Who would have ever thought that it would come to this, man?
Quicksand is what this life feel like
That shit these rappers kick is nothin' like real life
You made a milli off of servin' hard white, yeah right
My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like
Stupid niggas, I heard the cops be shootin' niggas
I swear to God, wish I could bullet proof my niggas
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruitin' niggas
We tryna stand tall when it gets to crucial niggas

Break down! We break down, we break down, we break down...

[Verse 3:]
Servin' time, locked down
And she don't want nobody to know, his daughter 25 pounds
By the time he get out, she gon' be 4
Now will his girl stay down?
Ain't no doubt, she love him yeah that's fo sho
But temptation stays round
And if she strayed, how could he ever know?
Never know and so, she goes to the club on the weekend
A little freakin', but them niggas holla
But she never speakin', but tonight I see the devil creepin'
Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in 7 seasons
Damn! She do the best that she can
Her mama tellin' her to find another man
She college educated with a felon boyfriend
That's what she thinkin' tonight
Maybe she's right, but please

Stay down mama! Gotta be strong, don't break down mama!
Please... stay down mama! Gotta be strong, don't break down mama!
Don't break down, don't break down, don't break down, don't break down...

Break, break down
Steady break me down
[repeat]

// Work Out //

I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me.

Hey, we got a good thing.
Don't know if I'mma see you again.
But is that a good thing?
'Cause, girl, I can't be your man.
No, ma'am.
I know what's on your brain.
You're probably hope it never would end.
Like is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?
Well, then...

Let me see you get high and go low.
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I'm here for one night. How far will you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me.

High and go low.
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I'm here for one night. How far will you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me.

She like them boys with the big old chains
Ride around town in the big old Range.
I knew her when I rock big old chains.
Now the little nigga doing big old things.

Would you look at that? I came back for it
Just to give it to you like you aksed for it.
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for it.
It rebounds, so, I caught off the backboard.

I told her, "Baby girl, come here.
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.
And I brag hardly,
but just to show up at this party
I made what your nigga make in one year.
that's unfair."

but so is life: take a chance, roll a dice.
Money can't buy you love 'cause it's over-priced.
Don't over-think, just hope it's right.
I'm only here for the night.

Hey, we got a good thing.
Don't know if I'mma see you again.
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl I can't be your man.
no, ma'am.
I know what's on your brain.
You probably hope it never would end.
Like is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?
Well, then...

Let me see you get high and go low.
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I'm here for one night. How far will you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me.

High and go low.
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I'm here for one night. How far will you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me.

Carolina blue kicks fresh on the scene.
Hottest nigga on the block. Damn, girl, you're mean.
They be starting shit, but it's your world.
On my Martin shit you go, girl.

She bad and she know it. Some niggas save hoes.
I'm not that heroic.
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two-door Fords.
Damn, they don't make 'em like you no more.

Cole World, real Cole World.
Them boys cool. Me. I'm on fire.
Know what's on my mind.
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight.

Move slow 'cause you wanna live fast.
Up late, so, you'll probably skip class.
Life is a test.
so before the night pass
get right get right.

Hey, we got a good thing.
Don't know if I'mma see you again.
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl I can't be your man.
no, ma'am.
I know what's on your brain.
You probably hope it never would end.
Like is it the real thing
or is just a one-night stand?
Well, then...

Cole World.

Straight up. Now tell me do you really wanna love me forever—
Oh, oh, oh—
Or is it just a hit-and-run?

Well, hey.

Straight up. I tell you I just really wanna cut when we're together.
Oh, oh, oh.
Come here, girl, let's get it on.

Work out for me, work out for me.

// Who Dat? //

Who dat who dat, the nigga you been waitin 4.
I mean the shit was all bad just a week ago.
Rappers is bull shittin. Fuck it,
I ain't hatin though
Cuz Now a nigga hot enough to
fuck with one of satin's hoes.
& She cant tell the difference.
I been through hell conditions.
Wishin for air conditions
feelin God was never listenin.
Now I'm on television
And did I fail to mention?
Your bitch is tired of missionary,
boy you failed the mission.
Speakin of positions? Just witness
how I elevated. Real niggas celebrate it, finger-fuck
whoever hate it. My life accelerated,
but had to wait my turn. But then I redecorated,
that means my tables turn. Live life, might as well,
only way to learn. Is try and fail clientele
the only way to earn. So if you're sellin crack..
or if you're sellin rap. Make sure it's mean
so them fiends keep on trailin back.

[Chorus]
Who dat who dat bitch I got the flame [x3]
So don't worry bout no muthafuckin name

The Mind state of a winner.
When you thinkin bout summertime
i'm thinkin bout the winter.
When you thinkin bout breakfast,
I'm heatin up my dinner. I was plottin this
moment back when yall was ridin spinners.
Now I'm a menace. God as my witness, with this pen I'm insane, yup.
Hungry like the nigga who ain't got the taste of fame yet.
Cloud told me "ain't you roc? well? where the fuck yo chain at?"
Guess it's somethin like your girl, nigga it aint came yet.
The man make the chain chain dont make the man
how many niggas do we know with hella ice but yet they lame
the cloth from which we came me and them is not the same
Like we all headed to spain, they took the boat I took the plane.Dang
That boy sick.Now Hoes on his joystick. Heatin up like may weather dog
I'm on that floyyd shyt.
Boy stick, to ya day job.
Said you was hot but they lied.
Is that ya girl? Well I just g'd her/jeter no a rod.

[Chorus]

[Andre 3000]
Now who else wanna fuck with hollywood cole?!

[Chorus]

// Daddy's Little Girl //

[Verse 1]
Hey, her mind is on a different level
Plus the teachers couldn't reach her, always been a rebel
Hit the club, watch out boy, you dancin' with the devil
She fuck, she suck, she swallow man, it's like a triple double
Can see it in your eyes, you look for trouble
Just because they fuck yo girl don't mean them niggas love ya
She said, "Don't preach to me nigga, hold up
Is that a bottle on your table, well if so then pour it up"
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy, what you think?",
"Little girl you're growin' up, growin' up"

[Hook]
Hey, take a couple of shots and it's on
"Bet you I can drink it straight without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy what you think?"
"Little girl you're growin' up, growin' up"
Hey, listen baby girl they playin' your song

Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl
[x2]

Daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl

[Verse 2]
Can I get a witness, this is Shawty mixed with Shawty Lo
Ey Jezebel, why you be up in every party for?
You lost to lookin' for a savior, I ain't Mario
I got no cape, but I can't wait to give you cardio
Work you out, you call me daddy, ain't my daughter though
Make me wonder where your father go?
She said, "Don't analyze me nigga, hold up
Is that green on your table? Well if so then roll it up,
I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy what you think?"
"Little girl you're growin' up, growin' up"

[Hook]
Hey, and blow a couple stacks and she gone
Said, "I can take it to the face without even throwin' up"
She said "Daddy what you think?"
"Little girl you're growin' up, growin' up"
Hey, listen baby girl they playin' your song

Mama couldn't never reach her
Brother tried his best to teach her
She thinks she's ready for the world
Just look at daddy's little girl

Daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
She's daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
