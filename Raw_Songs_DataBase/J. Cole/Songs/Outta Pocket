Give me two birds
I need two birds
Give me two birds
I need two birds

You wanna turn up and go a lil crazy
And fuck up the place
You wanna run up the mini bar
Did I just see you go look at my safe?
Bitch, you outta pocket, you outta place
You outta pocket, you outta place
You outta pocket, you outta place

Bitch, you outta pocket, you outta place
I gotta roll up, just smoked a quarter like 2 outta 8
Y'all niggas dead as a two dollar steak
I'm for the family, got food on the plate
With a side of a whole lot of hate
Nevermind I got somewhere to be
And I give you my word, triple my worth
See who I see, flippin' my bird
Keep this shit pushin' like fiends on the pack
Don't get us started that's Queens in the back
Don't get too startled, don't know how we 'gon react

Thank you, thank you, is yo baby daddy with you still? (With you still)
We don't speak no common language but I get you still (Get you still)

You outta pocket, I see I gotta turn yo ass into lint (Hm)
You getting turnt, you bent, off of the money I spent (Mm)
Now it's been a while since a nigga had to close a tab on a bitch 
(I close the tab on a bitch)
Might double back on this bitch (Might double back on a bitch)
'Cause all of them racks that you spent on them tits
Could've been used for taxes and rent (Oh)
You hate me for that, well, wah wah
Cry about it, matter fact
If keepin' it real 'gon fuck up my pussy then I'ma lie about it
I couldn't tell that ass was fake (No)
I didn't know you didn't have a place (No)
Don't know who you fucked last Saturday (I don't)
But I know what you wanna do after 8
Lil bitch

You wanna turn up and go a lil crazy
And fuck up the place
You wanna run up the mini bar
Did I just see you go look at my safe?
