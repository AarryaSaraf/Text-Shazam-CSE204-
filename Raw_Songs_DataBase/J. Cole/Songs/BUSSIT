Said have off my clothes when you arrive
You could seduce me with your eye
Don't want the smoke, don't waste my time
I'll be open for you
Work out my spine, I need you near
You scared of love, but fuck your fear
Ain't no gettin' away from this if you wanted to
Flowin', changin'
Take form in this ocean (Yeah, yeah)
Like water (Water)
I run right through ya

I know that you're into me, about it, then let me see
Ride, don't be scared of me, I'm rowdy as they can be
I like all the ways you do, ooh, boy, you're killin' me
I know that you feelin' me, bust it to the tenth degree
I know that you're into me, about it, then let me see
Ride, don't be scared of me, I'm rowdy as they can be (Yeah)
I like all the ways you do, ooh, boy, you're killin' me (Ooh, boy)
I know that you feelin' me, bust it to the tenth degree

So deep, I feel you in my mind (Oh)
So good, I want it all the time (Oh)
Bust in my garden, fertilize
Wanna grow with you, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
If it's on, we should get it on (Baby)
Gushy gush, do it all night long (Babe)
Cum first, there ain't nothin' wrong
In me is where you belong

I know that you're into me, about it, then let me see (I know)
Ride, don't be scared of me, I'm rowdy as they can be (No, no)
I like all the ways you do, ooh, boy, you're killin' me
I know that you feelin' me, bust it to the tenth degree (Yeah)
I know that you're into me, about it, then let me see
Ride, don't be scared of me, I'm rowdy as they can be
I like all the ways you do, ooh, boy, you're killin' me (Ooh, boy)
I know that you feelin' me, bust it

Is where you should be
Is where you should be
