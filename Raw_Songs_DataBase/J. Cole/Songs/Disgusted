Woo-ha
(Louie Ji the Wizard) Hush, ayy
Yeah (Shout out to Meez 'cause he noticed me, nigga)
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


I'm disgusted, she said she in love but it's nothin' we discussed yet
Says she love my hair and that shit growin' so luscious
And she wanna fuck but I know she fucked my cousin
Every time I think about you I say you disgustin'


I'm disgusted, she said she in love and that wasn't the discussion
Told you from the jump intentions was all disgusting
I can't put my heart here but my dick here, know I'm hustlin'
Should've took it slow from the beginning, but you rushed it
Acting like you get it and you with it but you crushin'
Whole time I was hittin', claiming lusty but you lovin'
Now your ass alright, I seen a text, ain't even touch it
Feeling denied, you just a liar, I'm disgusted


I'm disgusted, thought that I would drown underwater but my lungs is
Made out of that gills, I prevail in the jungle
I ain't Uncle Phil but my will keep me comfortable
Searching for my deal, you would feel I'm accustomed to
Fake niggas and fake bitches
Who move to LA to suck dick and take pictures
With the same niggas that hate but hang with us
Girl you get gang banged, you don't hang with gang members


I'm disgusted, straight here, violated by a later bitch, you busted
Confusing emotions with the fact I'm good at touchin'
Now you digging deeper for something realer than just fuckin'
Claim I was hiding feelings, yes I will, but I wasn't
Explainin' you still hear me, you chill, but it doesn't
Alicia keying cars 'cause she fallin', bitch, you clumsy
I'm just serving crack from house to house, I'm out here plumbing
She swear she the real, but no deal


I'm disgusted, she using her pussy for revenge, I'm disgusted
At least I shed that tear in a Benz, nigga fuck it
(Man and I got one tool but that's not what we discussin')
I never been a fool, you been knew I ain't trustin'
Made peace with her, there ain't a part of me that's fussin'
(Man, nigga, if you was up in my business, I ain't judgin')
(But, bruh, don't waste your time with hoes need attitude adjustin')
And never will I argue with a fool, that shit disgustin'


Man, ain't finna sit here and argue with your ass
You know how this shit started
Talking bout you cool, you know, you know how it go
You on the same shit


These groupie hoes put a bad taste in my mouth
Lying hoes put a bad taste in my mouth
Attention whores put a bad taste in my mouth
Bald bitches put a bad taste in my mouth
Groupie hoes put a bad taste in my mouth
Lying hoes put a bad taste in my mouth
Attention whores put a bad taste in my mouth
Bald bitches put a bad taste in my mouth
