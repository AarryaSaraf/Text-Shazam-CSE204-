Yeah
Uh, whoa, shit, whoa, shit
Whoa, whoa
Whoa shit, whoa
Yeah, uh, uh, yeah
This is gonna be weird, but don't cut it off though

Big black truck
Pull up and hop out, then go in your shit for a dollar
Bitch, back up
They want a problem, not really, but really it's nada
Click, clack, blow
Gather the women and children, then take them inside
Bitch, back up
Cry, cry, cry, cry, mommas'll cry

Up in the morning at 6:45
When I be up, I be talking to God
We in the jungle, it's scary, oh my
Lions and tigers and niggas with 9's
Cheaters and liars, but who on your side?
I think they setting me up for demise
I think they plottin', just look in they
Whoa shit, whoa shit

Okay, I could make a flash from a little piece of plastic
Throw the peace sign, better call the pediatrics
Or read Ecclesiastes, I'm cleaning up the cat fleas
I'm working on my back swing
They coming at my back attacking
A tackle, a technical foul, travel
Babbling Babylon, brother, you ready for battle?
And bet your bottom butler buddy
Gettin' black owned, if he act wrong
Get your motherfucking strap on
Leave it at home
And I'm Taxstone
B-r-r-at, b-r-r-at at your hat
Send me up to Sing Sing for that
If I miss you, I got niggas I could ring-ring for that
Shoot the picture, if I get you, I'ma get you
When I get you, I'ma get you, Jack
I'm kickin' back
Thinkin how these niggas tried to hate me in the rearview mirror
Like are y'all serious?
I'ma pull up on niggas and these just my littles but these be the killers for real

Up in the morning at 6:45
When I be up, I be talking to God
We in the jungle, it's scary, oh my
Lions and tigers and niggas with 9's
Cheaters and liars, but who on your side?
I feel they setting me up for demise
I think they plottin', just look in they eyes
Whoa shit, whoa shit, okay

Big black truck
Pull up and hop out, then go in your shit for a dollar
Bitch, back up
They want a problem, not really, but really it's nada
Click, clack, blow
Gather the women and children, then take them inside
Bitch, back up
Cry, cry, cry, cry, mommas'll cry
