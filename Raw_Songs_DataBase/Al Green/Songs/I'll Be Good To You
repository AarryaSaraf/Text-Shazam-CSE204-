Don't give me that kind of love
I can't take it
Don't  the kind of 
You can't make it

, that's my thrill
I'll do the same for you, I'm for real

I'll be good to you
Got to be so good
I'll be sweet
Yes I will, yes I will

Don't be the kind of one to take my love
Leaving my in distress, thinking of
Just do the things that I do for you
You won't regret, baby

I'll be good to you
Got to be so good
I'll be good to you
Yes I will, yes I will

Don't promise me the things you can't do
Why would you disappoint my faith in you
Let me help you baby in my way
You'll never have to worry night or day

I'll be good to you
Got to be so good
Gonna be sweet to you
Yes I will, yes I will
