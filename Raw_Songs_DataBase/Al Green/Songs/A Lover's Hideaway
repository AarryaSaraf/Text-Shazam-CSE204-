A lover's hideaway, yeah
From all this pain and miserly
Where freedom reigns with liberty
Come and go with me where we can be free
Come and tell y'all, c'mon

A lover's hideaway, yeah
From all this hate and poverty
So we can find a place to be
Lord, children now, come and go with me
Where we can be free
Join me, come and walk with me now, c'mon

Wooahoo... baby, baby, baby, baby

A lover's hideaway, yeah
From all the shame to share no blame
We live and love with no more pain
Everybody hear me, come and go with me
Where we can be free, alright
Tryin' to tell y'all, now, c'mon

Baby, baby, baby, all you've got to do is come and go with me
Where we can raise our children with dignity
We'll find a place way, way, way back in the hills
And call it our lover's hideaway
I just wanna say woooah... baby
