I don't believe in fortune tellers
I wouldn't put a penny in a wishing well
I know what Santa Claus is all about
Glad I never seen him

You stepped out of a dream, captured my heart
Opened my arms and gave me a new start

There's love (there is love)
I've been sayings there's love (there is love love love)
Oh there's love (there is love)
I've been saying there's love (there is love love love)

Stranger my heart 
I never been a paid above
But the beauty of your old love
Has made the song of heart

Count all my lessons, from being brand new
I needed someone to love and I was blessed from you

There's love (there is love)
I've been sayings there's love (there is love love love)
Oh there's love (there is love)
I can feel it there's love (there is love love love)

I'm counting all my blessings from being brand new
I needed someone to love and I was blessed from you 

There's love (there is love)
I know love (there is love love love)
So glad that love (there is love)
Oh there's love (there is love love love)
