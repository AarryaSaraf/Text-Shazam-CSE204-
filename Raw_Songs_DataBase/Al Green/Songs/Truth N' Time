Only the truth can make you see
Only the truth if you love me
Only the truth put a smile on your face
Only love can take your place
But time can erase
Only truth can save our faith
Let me say

Time, time, need a little time
Only the truth and time, let me say
Time, time, need a little time
Time, time, time, oh

Only the truth can let you know
Only the truth if you love me so
Only the truth can make you see
Tell me the truth if you love me
And let me say that

Time, time, can erase
Let me say tellin' truth is our saving grace
And I said

Time, time, all we need is time
Time, time, let me say
Time, time, all we need is time
Oh one of these old days, they said

Time, oh can erase
All  that heart is
Is saved by grace

Time, time, all we need is time
Time, time, all we need is time
Time, time, all we need is time
...
