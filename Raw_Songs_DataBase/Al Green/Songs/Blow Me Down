Well well well
Said I got another one of those days

Blow me down
It's another one of those days
Blow me down
I'm just livin' in the same old way
(You play it)

Day to day problems
I'm catchin' hell tryin' to solve 'em
Too many bills and not enough pills
For my headache, oh and time won't wait
Stayin' legal
Is hard without the eagle
Too much strife in everyone's life
And the world just turns and turns

Blow me down
It's another one of those days
Blow me down
I'm just livin' in the same old way
(You play it)
Just livin' in the same old way

There's too many heroes
And too many halos
Striving to save material things
And oh boy, where is the joy
I'm feelin' lonely
I don't wanna be phoney
What's for real and what is ideally mine

Well just blow me down, blow me down
Blow me down, blow me down
Blow, blow me down
Just blow me down
It's another, another one of those days
Blow me down, blow me, blow me down
Blow me, ooh
Let me say it again, ooh
Let me say it again, ooh
Oh say it again...
