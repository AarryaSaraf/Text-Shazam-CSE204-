I'm happy, I can see
My eyes are wide open, and what a relief
Baby girl, I'm happy about you and me
Words are all spoken for ecstasy, yeah

Out of a bright cloudy sky
The sun came out and dried my eyes
Now that's the world to me, yeah
Yeah, open your eyes, son, show you can see, yeah

I'm happy, it's another day
It's you and me, mama send it on home to me
It's satisfying, I'm relyin'
I'm happy, got me cryin'

Yeah, I'm happy
It's another day, yeah
Tell you, I've found it, like they used to say
Finally I can see my way, Lord

Well, I'm happy
Say it once again, yeah
Say I found myself a love
I found a friend, yeah

What more can I say, yeah?
Except that only yesterday
There's no sorrow
Just hope for tomorrow
