Happy days are here again
Found myself a brand new friend

Oh I found a new way of giving
Oh I found a new way of living

Happy days are here
Happy ways are near
Never shed a tear
Happy days are here, oh my
It's been awhile

Oh I believe I'll try again, well well
Sing the song without an end
Keep lookin' up

Happy days are here, no no
Happy days are here
Happy days are here, yes, oh

Happy days are here
I'll never have to shed a tear
Happy times are near
You'll never have to shed a tear

Happy days are here
Happy times are near
Happy days are here
Happy times are near

Happy days are here
Happy times are near
Happy days are here
Happy times are near

Oh I found a new way of giving
Oh I found a new way of living
Keep me lookin' up, hey

Happy, feelin' kind of happy
Happy, feelin' kind of happy
Smile, the smile is kind of happy
Stay happy, happy, happy
Makes me happy, we'll have to go and say
Ooh, it makes me happy, the mood...
I wonder would you dance awhile
Sing happy days are here
Happy days are here
Happy times are near
Happy days are here

Feels so good to me...

Happy days are here
Happy times are near
Happy days are here
Happy times are near
...
