Don't let this world mislead you
Don't you ever go astray
Trust in God's word and believe it 'cause it'll never pass away
We will see Him in his glory riding on the clouds of joy
Greeting us with open arms and peace forever more

I know that everything is gonna be all right
He's coming back
Like he said He would
Yeah yeah, it's gonna be alright
He's coming back
For the true and good

Now when the sky is darkened
There will be no moonlight
We'll know the time has finally come
And he'll change the wrong to right
So if you're always searching
Trying to find the bottom line
Just give your love and life to God
He'll give you a peace of mind

I know that everything gonna be all right
He's coming back
Like he said he would
I said yeah yeah, it's gonna be alright
He's coming back
For the true and good
Play it
Everything is gonna be all right
He's coming back
Just like he said he would
Yeah yeah, it's gonna be alright
He's coming back
For the true and good

I wanna be ready, I gotta be ready
I wanna be ready, gotta be ready
For the peace, love and happiness
He's coming back like He said he would
Get ready for peace, love and happiness
He's coming back for the true and good

We know He's the beginning and we know that He is the end
There's no one better if you really need a friend
So don't you ever worry 'cause he gave the quarantee
That he'll return to take us home and fulfill the prophecy

I know that everything is gonna be all right
He's coming back, like He said He would
Get ready for peace, love and happiness
I know He's coming back just like He said he would
Peace and love and happiness
I know He's coming back for the true and good
Everything gonna be all right
He's coming back
Like He said he would
Yeah yeah, it's gonna be alright
