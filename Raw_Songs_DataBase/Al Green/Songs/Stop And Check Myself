Every time I make the moves on some girl (will break my heart)
Lord, I've got to stop, babe (and check myself)
Oh baby baby look, making love to you is so grand
I need somebody to hold my hand
I can't understand why you treat me this way
I need your lovin' from day to day
I've got to stop, baby (and check myself)
Baby baby baby baby, I got to do it now
Oh oh baby got to stop (and check myself)
(Stop and check myself)
