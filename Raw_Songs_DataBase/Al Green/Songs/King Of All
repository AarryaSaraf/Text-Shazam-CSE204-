Snow falling gracefully
Bright sunshine makes me believe
That it is God that keeps me alive
Though I work from day to day
I found I just can't make a way
Without the Lord, King of all

What's the matter with your mind
You have eyes and you are blind
Prayer is the way to Him
Without Him you'll never win
Don't you feel the spirit move
Tell me you're controlling you
I'd be wrong not to say
It's true light's the only way

Oh King of all, You lived for awhile
Hey King of all, You're the reason I smile
Oh King of all, You lived for awhile
Oh King of all, You're the reason I smile

Like children playing happily
Oh how happy we could be
Give your life back to the King
And He'll give you everything
Lay your burden right on down
Feel the earth go round and round
Let the Holy Spirit in
We are children of the King

King of all, you lived for awhile
Oh King of all, don't you know You're the reason I smile
Oh King of all, lived for awhile
King of all, oh you've got to be the reason
You're the reason, oh I said
King of all, King of all, King of all
King of, You're the reason, You're the reason...
