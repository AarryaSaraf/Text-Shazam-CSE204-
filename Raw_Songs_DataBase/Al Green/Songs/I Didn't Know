I didn't know that you love me like you do
I didn't know that you cared like you do
I didn't know that your love was so strong
To keep me warm
I didn't know
I didn't know that you feel like you do
When you feel like you feel
Makes a man want to steal from you
I didn't know people were talking about
The way you hold my hand
If feeling good is what it's all about
Won't you try to understand?
For all that cry that don't know no love
I don't know no one whole
I'll think you'll understand
It's love that makes a man
So we're back to grains of time
Grains of sand
I didn't know that you loved me
You should have told me
You should have explained to me
I didn't know you love me like you do
So much like you do makes me
Talk in my sleep and things
I didn't know that you
I didn't know that you want to hold me
Like you do
The way you talk to me
When you're talking to me
I didn't know you love me like you do
My my, I keep on...
The way you're saying something to me
I didn't know
Nobody told me, nobody explained to me
Nobody said anything to me
Nobody called on the telephone
And I just get that feeling way down
I didn't know that you love me
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
I didn't know, I didn't know
I didn't know you love me like you do
It makes me, makes me wanna...
You should have told me
Somebody, won't you help me?
Smooth talking, easy walking
Sweet little woman like you, yeah
Somebody better do something for me
I didn't know that you needed me
Should have called
Should have explained
Said
Should have said
