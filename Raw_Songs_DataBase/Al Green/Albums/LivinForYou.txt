Album: LivinForYou

// Livin' For You //

I guess there's no good reason for livin'...
But I'll keep on livin' for you, baby...
There's nothing else to do, babe...
But spend my life holding you and lovin' you...

Oh...
If I ask you more than one million times to forgive me...
You think of a reason why...
that you should make me cry (don't make me cry)...
walk out and say goodbye away from me...

Oh...
I'm tired of the bright ideas about leavin' me...
when you know you ain't goin' nowhere...
but here with me...
here with me...
Let me tell you a thing...
stop and think of just how good I've been to you baby...

I'm causin' no trouble for you baby...
this story just can't be true, baby...
how can I convince you, baby...
but just tell you the truth...

I'm livin' for you... givin' for you... waitin' for you...
(lemme tell you what I'm doin'...)
I'm layin' for you... prayin' for you... workin' for you...
(...livin' my life, I tell you that...)
I'm livin' for you... givin' for you... givin' for you...
layin' for you... prayin' for you... workin' for you...
(everything I do I still...)
do with you... (something to) do with you...

// Free At Last //

I'm free, thank god almighty
Free at last, free, free, free, free
Oh, I give your name the praise
Free at last

Free, free, free, free,
Thank god almighty

Thank god almighty, free at last

Thank you, thank you Jesus, the lord oh, yeah
Oh, how you pick me up, turn me around
Place my feet on solid ground
Yes you did and yes you did, yes you did

Hey, took me out of the muddy clay
Set me on a rock to stay yes you did, yes you did, yes you did

Oh, you blessed my soul with plenty of love
Gave me wings to fly above
Yes you did, yes you did, yeah

I love your name, I love your name [x3]
Whoa, I'm free, free
Yes, my love can't justify the king, yes I

// Let's Get Married //

Sitting here
Wasting my time for you
And I'm not too crazy about the idea
Having nothing to do

I'm tired of playing around
Girl in every town
I want to settle down
And stop foolin' around 
(Let's get married)
I've got to stop foolin' around
(Let's get married)
Stop foolin around
(Let's get married)
You don't believe me but I want to stop foolin around

Let me say it
I didn't mean to say all the things I said (Oh no)
The way I felt in my heart
It came out that way
Let me tell you one thing
Don't want to say anything to drive you away

Let's get married today
(Let's get married)
Yeeaaah
(Let's get married)
(Let's get married)
Alright
Alright
(Let's get married)
Let's get married today

Might as well
Might as well
'Cause take you in my arms and hold you
Take you in arms and squeeze you
Take you in my arms and love you every night
Just make everything alright alright
I wanna soothe you baby 
Let me soothe you baby (again)
Soothe you baby
So I can wipe all your tears away
So I can wipe all your tears away
So I can wipe all your tears away
So I can wipe all your tears away
Yeah Yeah
You can know me
You don't believe me
Let's get married today
I found out I didn't, I don't love nobody anyway
Let's get married today

// Sweet Sixteen //

You get up early in the morning just to see her eyes
She's walking 'round the house in a complete disguise
I don't know just how to tell you, just how she changed so fast
But she's the prettiest thing in my life at last

I'm [?] a silver moon, baby
I can't stand to see you in my bedroom
I'm moving with
And I wanna dance with my sweet love sixteen

I can't believe the way you hold me
I can't believe the way you console me
Oh, I wanna dance with my sweet love sixteen

Oh, the fellows wanna just touch her or hold her hand real tight
But she is the prettiest thing out here tonight, gentlemen
If the dancing gets good to you, lay down in your shawl
You try to move your body, you might lose control, tell you one thing

I don't believe the way you hold me
The way you console me
Oh God, I wanna dance with
My sweet love sixteen, alright

Tell you what I'll do, just talk with
Tell what I'll do unless you walk with
I believe I'll let ya sing baby
I don't want you to hold me

// Unchained Melody //

Oh, my love, oh, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time

And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?

I need your love, I need your love
God speed your love to me
Speed your love to me, speed your love to me

Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
I just had to tell you that

Lonely rivers sigh, wait for me, wait for me
I'll be comin' home, wait for me
Please, baby, let me say

Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?

I need your love, I need your love
God speed your love to, to me
Speed your love to me, speed your love to me
Speed your love to me, speed your love to me
Speed your love to me, speed your love to me
Speed your love to me

// My God Is Real //

There are some things
I may not know
There are some places
Oh lord, I cannot go

But I am sure
Of this one thing
That god is real
For I can feel
Him in my soul

Yes, God is real
Oh, he's real in my soul
Yes, god is real
For he has a washed
And made me whole

His love for me
Is just like pure gold, oh lord
My god is real
For I can feel
Him in my soul

Yes, god is real
Oh yes, god is real in my soul
Yes, god is real
For he has washed
And made me whole

His love for me
You know its just like pure gold
Oh yes

Yes, god is real for I can feel
Him in my soul
