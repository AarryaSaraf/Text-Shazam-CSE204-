// L-O-V-E (Love) //

I started to write this song about you
And then I decided that I would write it all about love
And it appeared to me
That you wasn't happy
And that's for sure, positively
That's what the world is made of
So give me more L-O-V-E, love
Love is a walk down Main street (oh love)
Love is an apple that is so sweet (love)
Love is something that can't be beat (love)

L-O-V-E is strange to me, Oh
I can't explain this feeling
Can't you see that salvation is freeing
It's all in the heavens, can't you see
You can always depend on me
To give you love

Love is a flower in my soul (oh love)
Love is a story that just can't be told (love)
Can't you feel it burning more and more (love)
Stop and look at the big wheel roll
I can't explain this feeling
Can't you see that salvation is freeing
I would give my life for the glory
Just to be able to tell the story
About love
I didn't mean to make you mad
A sweet story, I thought I had
But maybe time will bring us together
And I can be such a happy fella
About love
Love is something that is so divine (oh love)
Love is a feeling that's a friend of mine (love)
It can't be measured by no sign (love)
In your heart or even in your mind
About love, Love is as bright as the morning sun

// Rhymes //

Last night and the night before
Twenty-five robbers at my door
I got up and let 'em in
But I missed 'em all with a rollin' pin

Alright they took everything I own
Like a king down from his throne
Yeah-ah-ah-ah
I can't let it get me down
Change my smile into a frown
Oh hey yeah -eh

(I can't let it get me down,
change my smile into a frown)

Just all about to send it southside 
Even though I know you are tired
Now it's time for love again 
Pain is found and finally went

Took everything I own 
Like a king without his throne 
I can't let it get me down
Change my smile into a frown 

(I can't let it get me down,
change my smile into a frown)

All is fair in love and war
What are you fightin' here for
Time about to right just one
There's no cost and there's no fun

Yeah hey hey hey
It'll never happen again
But it has to end
I can't let it get me down
Change my smile into a frown  

(I can't let it get me down,
change my smile into a frown)

// The Love Sermon //

A grain of love is falling down
And time is there beside.
The carnival and the fair is always here,
Having fun on the rides.
Love is the dimension between time and feeling,
The distance from heaven to earth.
Well, that's my understanding
And I pray on, I pray on.

There's one thing I keep on looking for:
My someone to collect the grains of sand,
Cease the thought of times.
Something is on my mind
I'm standing,
I'm standing and I feel love's divineness:
My soul and heart and my mind,
I pray on.

Let me say - Little one, take my hand
Let us ask the Creator Man
Give us the wisdom to understand
What it feels to be a man
And say - I want to do everything for you
That ordinary men won't do
I want to climb the highest mountain
I think it's big enough for two.

Oh, come on...
If you won't go with me,
Listen to my melody -
I can change your mind
In the right course of time, yeah.

You should count all your blessings, man.
Let known your feelings for all your friends:
They may be surprised when you say
There's love and the miraculous day.

Oh, my, my...
If you won't go with me,
Listen to my melody -
I can change your mind
In the right course of time.

I want to make a donation this evening to
All the good things in our hearts and our minds
That we know that we ought to do.
I've got to strive for higher ground:
The Man who saves souls is coming down.

Oh, if you won't go with me,
Listen to my melody -
I can change your mind
In the right course of time.

Hey, hey, everything I desire
Still I don't need you
I don't need you now.
I don't need you now.
Hey, stay with me,
Listen to my melody -
I can change your mind
Hey, I can change your mind.

// There Is Love //

I don't believe in fortune tellers
I wouldn't put a penny in a wishing well
I know what Santa Claus is all about
Glad I never seen him

You stepped out of a dream, captured my heart
Opened my arms and gave me a new start

There's love (there is love)
I've been sayings there's love (there is love love love)
Oh there's love (there is love)
I've been saying there's love (there is love love love)

Stranger my heart 
I never been a paid above
But the beauty of your old love
Has made the song of heart

Count all my lessons, from being brand new
I needed someone to love and I was blessed from you

There's love (there is love)
I've been sayings there's love (there is love love love)
Oh there's love (there is love)
I can feel it there's love (there is love love love)

I'm counting all my blessings from being brand new
I needed someone to love and I was blessed from you 

There's love (there is love)
I know love (there is love love love)
So glad that love (there is love)
Oh there's love (there is love love love)

// Could I Be The One? //

Could I be the one?

Could I be the one that you're thinking of
My goal is to be the one you're dreaming of
I wanna be your pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
Trust me and I'll never let you down

Let me be with you through all your hard times
I wanna be around when the chips are down
It'll be me and you, against the opposition
Can't you see our love shinning through?

You've been there to solve all of my problems
You've been there to help me solve them
I don't know what, I don't know what to do 
Yeah, yeah, yeah

(Could I be the one?)
Trust me with your dreams, I'll make them all come true
For the rest of my life, I'll be grateful to you
Time will pass, our love will last
I'll spend my life cherishing you

(Let me be the one)
Let me be the one in your life at the end of the rainbow
(Let me be the one)
Let me be the one that you love so
Late at night, the time is right
I wanna be the one you say is out of sight

(Let me be the one)
Let me be the one, let you be the girl
(Let me be the one)
Let me be, let me be the one, at the end of the rainbow
Oh, I'll never, never, never let you down

(Let me be the one)
Oh, I've got to be the one, let me be the one, be the one, oh yeah
At the end of the rainbow, I'll never, never, let you down
(Let me be the one, let me be the one)

// I Didn't Know //

I didn't know that you love me like you do
I didn't know that you cared like you do
I didn't know that your love was so strong
To keep me warm
I didn't know
I didn't know that you feel like you do
When you feel like you feel
Makes a man want to steal from you
I didn't know people were talking about
The way you hold my hand
If feeling good is what it's all about
Won't you try to understand?
For all that cry that don't know no love
I don't know no one whole
I'll think you'll understand
It's love that makes a man
So we're back to grains of time
Grains of sand
I didn't know that you loved me
You should have told me
You should have explained to me
I didn't know you love me like you do
So much like you do makes me
Talk in my sleep and things
I didn't know that you
I didn't know that you want to hold me
Like you do
The way you talk to me
When you're talking to me
I didn't know you love me like you do
My my, I keep on...
The way you're saying something to me
I didn't know
Nobody told me, nobody explained to me
Nobody said anything to me
Nobody called on the telephone
And I just get that feeling way down
I didn't know that you love me
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
I didn't know, I didn't know
I didn't know you love me like you do
It makes me, makes me wanna...
You should have told me
Somebody, won't you help me?
Smooth talking, easy walking
Sweet little woman like you, yeah
Somebody better do something for me
I didn't know that you needed me
Should have called
Should have explained
Said
Should have said

// Oh Me, Oh My (Dreams In My Arms) //

I had a dream
Thinking that you were gone
Leaving me on my own

And you, you was there
In some other's arms
Giving away all my charms

And when I awake
I want to hear you
Filling my life with cheer

And when I come back
You won't be alone
Cause I'll be at home

Oh, me, oh, my
Dreams in my arms
With you at home with me

I'm so?
It was only a dream

Oh, me, oh, my
Dreams in my arms
Is all I have to hold
Since you've been gone

I can be so good to you
Help me, help me sing

Oh, me, oh, my
Dreams in my arms
Ever since you been gone
I'm glad it's only a dream

Let me say one thing
Oh, me, oh, my
Dreams in my arms
Is all I have to hold
Since you've been gone

Come on back home
Sometimes I dream
About you, baby

Oh, me, oh, my
Dreams in my arms
Ever since you been gone....

// I Gotta Be More (Take Me Higher) //

Gotta be more than a cigarette smoker, practical joker, more
Just super fly, tryna be high, more
They understand a better man, more
Than a demonstrator, obligator, take me higher

Up to the sky make me cry take me higher
Where the birds don't fly take me higher
Up to the sky, higher

One thing odd it seems I've been a bad boy
I don't know just where to turn
Can't turn you soul burn won't you take me higher

Up to the sky where the birds fly take me higher
I want to see the golden city higher
Come on roll with me take me higher

Gotta be more (higher)
Than a friendly brother without the other more (higher)
Than your pride that's inside be more (higher)
Than friends do you in be more (higher)
Than the righteous one up to take me higher

Up to the sky make me cry take me higher
...higher
Up to the sky make me cry higher

// I Wish You Were Here //

Lookin' out my window, sun shinin' bright
Birds singin', tryin' to make things right
I've got good music on my radio
How did your love songs play from those doors?

I don't want no one to come in to catch me sigh
But every since you left, said goodbye
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me

[?] 'bout your kiss, gloom all around me
Seem like love is never gonna find me
I keep on looking for a, a brighter day
When all I see is time slipping away

I've got to stop and get myself together
All I can see is stormy weather
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me

I've got to stop, get myself together
'Coz all I can see is stormy weather
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here with me
I wish you were here
I just wish you were here with me
