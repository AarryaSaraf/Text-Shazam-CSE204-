// Stop And Check Myself //

Every time I make the moves on some girl (will break my heart)
Lord, I've got to stop, babe (and check myself)
Oh baby baby look, making love to you is so grand
I need somebody to hold my hand
I can't understand why you treat me this way
I need your lovin' from day to day
I've got to stop, baby (and check myself)
Baby baby baby baby, I got to do it now
Oh oh baby got to stop (and check myself)

// Let Me Help You //

Girl, if you knew I've come to help you
We're in love so let me help you, girl
Do I make dreams come true
Do without just to comfort you
Do I do anything
Anything just to ease the pain

I can be true, so let me help you, girl
Don't turn me down, let me help you, girl

You're at home feeling sad and blue
Dry your eyes, let me comfort you
Bring to you lots of love
I've got love, baby, I've got love

Dreams can come true, just let me help you
We're in love, let me help you, girl
I got to help you, baby
Give you all my lovin' now baby

// I'm Reachin' Out //

I can hear you talking so far away
Can't quite understand it, don't know what to say
Looking around like a Roman scout
I know it's your love baby, turn it all about

You got me reachin' out
Everyday, baby
Baby got me reachin' baby, reachin' out

I'm in the dark and I can't see
Your love, baby, has blindfold me
Holding out my hand because the lights are out
Now walk up closer, baby, feeling all about

You got me reachin' every day now
You got me reachin' in the morning
You got me reachin', baby
Reachin', reachin'
Reachin', reachin'
Reachin', reachin'
Reachin' for you baby

// Don't Hurt Me No More //

My heart beats the pain
Ohh, listen to me
My tears won't flood away, ohh, yeah

You look in my eyes, you will realize
I've been hurting, being mistreated
I'm a lonely fool, I've been cheated, baby, yeah

Don't hurt me no more now
Ooh, baby, baby, yeah, don't hurt me no more
Will you [?]

Ooh, never say goodbye
Do you know that I'm on my knees?
Girl, I'm cryin', need a lovin' hand
My heart is hurtin', baby, yeah

Don't hurt me no more
Ooh, yeah, baby, baby, don't hurt me no more now
I'm on bended knees, yeah, baby, baby, don't hurt me no more

// Don't Leave Me //

(Don't leave me, Baby
Baby don't leave)

Let's make our love last, pretty baby
Don't leave me, baby
Give love a chance
Baby, stand by me
Don't leave, baby

Though you think I cheated on you
Believe me, I've been true
Please, don't you leave
Don't treat me this way
I beg you, won't you stay?

Sing the song now

I love you, baby
(Don't leave me, baby)
My my my
I'll save all my love
For you and God above
(Baby don't leave)

I love you madly
(Baby)
Don't leave
(Don't leave me, baby)
Down on my knees
I beg and plead

Though you think I cheated on you
Believe me, I've been true
Please, don't you leave
Don't treat me like waste
I beg you, won't you stay?

Baby, please darlin'
Down on bended knees
(Don't leave me, baby)
All I need is you, baby
Lord, baby baby
(Baby don't leave)
Baby, don't leave
Down on bended knees
I beg and plead
(Don't leave me, baby)
And of all the pain..
And I know pain
Is to love someone in vain
(Baby don't leave)
Baby, baby, baby
Please stay, darlin'
(Don't leave me, baby)

// I'll Be Good To You //

Don't give me that kind of love
I can't take it
Don't [?] the kind of [?]
You can't make it

[?], that's my thrill
I'll do the same for you, I'm for real

I'll be good to you
Got to be so good
I'll be sweet
Yes I will, yes I will

Don't be the kind of one to take my love
Leaving my in distress, thinking of
Just do the things that I do for you
You won't regret, baby

I'll be good to you
Got to be so good
I'll be good to you
Yes I will, yes I will

Don't promise me the things you can't do
Why would you disappoint my faith in you
Let me help you baby in my way
You'll never have to worry night or day

I'll be good to you
Got to be so good
Gonna be sweet to you
Yes I will, yes I will

// Guilty //

Girl I love you
Yeah, yeah, honest I do
And I'm guilty, baby
On being untrue

What you heard
Through the grapevine
Every word it's true
Now the blame's all mine you all

I'm guilty
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm guilty, guilty, guilty
Baby, I'm guilty of this crime

Don't condemn me
Or cast me aside
'Cause I'm gonna be good to you
Love to you is more, more important
Than your foolish pride, ooh

Just put me on probation
Loving you is my
Yeah, an infatuation

Guilty, yeah
Ooh, I'm guilty
But listen

Don't condemn me, baby, baby, baby
Or cast me aside
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Loving you is more hard
Than your foolish pride

All you got to do is
Just put me on probation
Loving you is more, yeah
Than infatuation

'Cause I'm guilty
Not so guilty, guilty
Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty
Don't condemn me

// What's It All About //

Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
Seems you're not the girl you used to be
What is it, baby, have you grown tired of me?
What's it all about?

Listen, when we're alone it's not the same
I hold you close, yet you're so far away
You never seem to hear what I say
What's it all about, baby?

You don't have to lie
You don't have to hide
The feeling you have
For another guy

If there is someone closer to you
I'll be content with yesterday's memories
Honey, just say the word and we'll go our separate ways
What's it all about?

What's on your mind, I gotta know
Somebody tell me, baby
I wanna know what it's all about
What's on your mind
I gotta know, yeah yeah
Somebody tell me what it's all about

// A Lover's Hideaway //

A lover's hideaway, yeah
From all this pain and miserly
Where freedom reigns with liberty
Come and go with me where we can be free
Come and tell y'all, c'mon

A lover's hideaway, yeah
From all this hate and poverty
So we can find a place to be
Lord, children now, come and go with me
Where we can be free
Join me, come and walk with me now, c'mon

Wooahoo... baby, baby, baby, baby

A lover's hideaway, yeah
From all the shame to share no blame
We live and love with no more pain
Everybody hear me, come and go with me
Where we can be free, alright
Tryin' to tell y'all, now, c'mon

Baby, baby, baby, all you've got to do is come and go with me
Where we can raise our children with dignity
We'll find a place way, way, way back in the hills
And call it our lover's hideaway
I just wanna say woooah... baby
