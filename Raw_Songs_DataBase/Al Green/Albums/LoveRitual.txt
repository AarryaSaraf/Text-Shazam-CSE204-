// So Good To Be Here //

Now, now that it's over, baby
I can come home to you
Just as I should do

And you're waiting there for me
Just as you should be
I'm hoping to see you soon

Now that you've got all the things
That you need, babe
You're still here waitin' for me

So good to be here
It's so good to see your face
It's so good to be loved by you
In every way

All I can say or do
Is give my love to you
Just as I should do

I can't imagine me leaving you
Wasting my time
When I wanna be with you, babe

So good to be here
So good to see your face
So good to be loved by you

Everyday it's hard to make you stay
But still in your heart
You're gonna run away from me, baby

So good to be here
It's so good to see your face

// Beware //

The way people smile and say
Using me in every way, its okay
Times are changing, life is upside down
No reason to cry now, oh, no reason to cry now

Beware of who you listen to 
Beware of what you believe
Ain't nothing I can do to you
To make you love
Friends are the reason for so many breakups and breakdowns
Round town, so many people think that life is so much fun
We've only just begun
Begun to have some fun

Beware of what you listen to
Beware of what you believe 
Ain't nothing I can do to you
To make you love me

Beware of who you listen to
Beware of what you believe
Ain't nothing I can do to you
To make you love me, to make you love
