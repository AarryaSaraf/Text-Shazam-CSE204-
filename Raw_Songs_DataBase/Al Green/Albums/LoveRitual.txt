// So Good To Be Here //

Now, now that it's over, baby
I can come home to you
Just as I should do

And you're waiting there for me
Just as you should be
I'm hoping to see you soon

Now that you've got all the things
That you need, babe
You're still here waitin' for me

So good to be here
It's so good to see your face
It's so good to be loved by you
In every way

All I can say or do
Is give my love to you
Just as I should do

I can't imagine me leaving you
Wasting my time
When I wanna be with you, babe

So good to be here
So good to see your face
So good to be loved by you

Everyday it's hard to make you stay
But still in your heart
You're gonna run away from me, baby

So good to be here
It's so good to see your face

// Beware //

The way people smile and say
Using me in every way, its okay
Times are changing, life is upside down
No reason to cry now, oh, no reason to cry now

Beware of who you listen to 
Beware of what you believe
Ain't nothing I can do to you
To make you love
Friends are the reason for so many breakups and breakdowns
Round town, so many people think that life is so much fun
We've only just begun
Begun to have some fun

Beware of what you listen to
Beware of what you believe 
Ain't nothing I can do to you
To make you love me

Beware of who you listen to
Beware of what you believe
Ain't nothing I can do to you
To make you love me, to make you love

// Strong As Death (Sweet As Love) //

Strong as death, sweet as love
with the grace, of a dove
Oh baby
Let me in your life

We don't have that much time
There's no need in us crying
Hey baby
I'm in the mood for love

If I could tell a story
Of just how it was
Before there was you and me
Before there was love
It was a sad affair

I got to go ahead with myself
Before I findÂ [?]
Help me off the shelf
Sweet baby

One more thing I got to say
Strong as death,
You're a power to be
Sweet as love,
To you and me
Hey baby
Take a chance on me

Strong as death, sweet as love

Hey let me just sing
Strong as death, honey, sweet as love
Strong as death, honey, sweet as love

Strong as love, sweet as love
ah, you're playing to much music for me

// Up Above My Head //

Up above my head
I hear music in the air
Up above my head
I hear singing somewhere

I do believe, I do believe, I do believe, I do
There's a Heaven somewhere
I do believe, I do believe, I do believe
There's a Heaven somewhere

Got to say, up above my head
Hear somebody, up above
Up above, up above my head
I hear singing in the air, yeah

Give me a place to stay, I'll rule the earth
Yes, I will, oh yes, I will, oh, yeah
Give me a lovin' hand, baby, yeah
I'll take you by the hand and show you love is worth

Up above, up above

I do believe, I do believe, I do believe
There's gotta be heaven somewhere
I believe, I got to believe, baby
And there's heaven somewhere

Up above, up above
Up above, up above

Baby, up above my head, oh, have mercy
Up above my, baby, baby, baby
You know, up above my head
Baby, baby, baby, up above

// Love Is Real //

Let me tell you what I told you
Long before I noticed love is real, yes
Say something
Don't sit there, say nothing

I will try to explain it to you
It's glory, Alleluia, this love is real
Won't you please clap your hands?
Please, say amen

'Cause love is so high, you can't get over
You're lucky to find a holy clover
Give it a try, you can't get 'round it
You'll reach the sky, you're only grounded

I will try to break it down, release it to be found
This love is real, yeah
Won't you clap your hands?
Somebody say, amen

Hey, we can fill it up
And feel our love then come to us
Love is real, yeah, say it aloud
Sit down, say nothing

Trying to be real, not trying to fool ya
Don't know it all, just trying to school ya
This common love, you won't get by now
But this kind of love you'll find in the sky

We can feel it up
And feel our love encounters love is real
Say something
Don't sit down say nothing, no

These feelings make you wanna want some
Feeling make you wanna want some
Hey, makes you clap your hands, son
Makes you clap your hands, son

I wish I could have
Something to say this evening
I gotta have
Something to say this evening

I'd say one Sunday evening
Somebody came knocking at my door
Knocking at my door, open the door and let him in
Was a feeling, oh, oh, feeling, hey

Make me wanna want some
Make me wanna want some
Make me wanna want some
Make me lost, ah, just a squeeze

Oh, mug around the house
Talking about going someplace
One thing about it I never heard mama
Talk about going to Chicago too much

I might even go into New York city
But never had an idea
That I wanna go to heaven
And I wanna go to heaven

I wanna go, I feel pretty good
I wanna go to [?]
I feel pretty good, yeah
I feel like, I feel like I wanna, huh

That's a note
Hey, this love is real, this love is real
Hey, this love is real
Hey, they wanna love is real

This love is real
So real, so real, so real
Love is real, this love is real, yes, it's real
This love is real

// Ride Sally Ride //

Yeah, again

Sally was a girl that lived in Memphis
Was down on all the latest dances
I found the groove and Sally start to move
And all the guys taking chances and everybody would say

Ride Sally ride, is all you gotta do wipe your weepin' eyes
Tell you just shake it to the east now, baby, yeah just
Shake it to the west now, baby, hey, baby just
Shake now, shake it, shake, shake it, yeah

Sally would dance all night long, this is what I say to you, yeah
How we fly we doin' till we die
We dancin' till the night is through
Everybody sing

Ride Sally ride, oh, make me feel good
Wipe your weeping eyes, all you gotta do is
Tell you just shake it to the east now, baby, I'd keep on sayin'
Shake it to the west now, baby, gettin' good, I said
