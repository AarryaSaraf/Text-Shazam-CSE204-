Album: EverythingsOK

// Everything's OK //

I wanna, I wanna come back home, baby
Out here baby everything is wrong, baby

In a dog-eat-dog world
Ain't nothing safe, baby
You've got mine, I've got yours
Everything's okay

I started out poor baby
Everybody knows you never told, baby
I got what it takes with my crazy ways
You came along and started this song
Everything's okay

Okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby
Okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby

You came along with your crazy ways
You came along and started this
Everything's okay

Okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby
Okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby

Okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby
Okay, okay, everything
Everything is okay, baby

// You Are So Beautiful //

You are so beautiful to me
You are so beautiful to me
Can't you see
You're everything I'd hoped for
You're everything I need
You are so beautiful to nobody but me

Such joy and happiness you bring
Such joy and happiness you bring
Like a dream you're everything, I I hoped for
You're everything that I need

And you are so beautiful
You are just beautiful to me
You are beautiful to me
You are so beautiful
You are so beautiful
You are beautiful to me

You're everything, I hoped for
You're everything that I need
You are how to explain, that
You are beautiful to me

// Build Me Up //

Ah, you build me up, build me up and
Just to let me down, let me down and
Then you fill my cup, fill my cup and
Turn my love around, all around

Why do you take me where my love can't go?
Why do you make me love you more and more?
I don't have the Eiffel tower, silver or gold
But my love for you, and my love for you
Is the greatest story ever told

Don't have the Eiffel tower, anything might die
Well, I love you, um, love you and that will survive

Why do you have to start, have to start that
Just to break my heart, break my heart, oh?
Tear it all apart, all apart and
Then you let it stop, let it stop

I can't stand it, baby, you, you move me so
And my love gets started, it goes and goes and goes and
This is not a dream and what love ought to make
Sometimes you just can see [?]

Don't have the Eiffel Tower or silver or gold
But my love for you, and my love for you
Is worth more and more and more

I want to stay this time
I, oh, wanna make you mine
And now, yeah, want to stay this time, yeah
I wanna make you mine

And I love you, baby, I

// Magic Road //

On this magic road I'm about to lose control
Oh, won't you bless my soul on this magic road
Down this magic road you can have anything you want
And leave out things you don't on this magic road

What is this I see? What a mystery
What a time to meet, baby

On this magic road smile is the down side
But don't you ever close your eyes on this magic road
On this magic road you can even drive my car
You can even be a superstar on this magic road

What is this I see? Oh my, my, my, my
What a mystery, what a time to meet
On this magic road, on this magic road

Just know who, we know who you are

What is this I see? What a mystery
Sure to find life's ecstasy

On this magic road nothing's impossible
You can depend on me, keep saying
On this magic, magic, road, yeah
On this magic road, if you turn on and off the bulb
On this magic road, on this magic road

You can have a big bank account
(On this magic road)
You can see the old they're comin' here
Hey watch out, watch out for the little man in the corner

On this magic road
You can be anything that you wanna be
But hey, hey, watch out for the little man
(On this magic road)

They don't have what you have
Watch out for the poor man
They don't have what what you're having

You got a bigger house and a Mercedes, big brother
(On this magic road)
But you hanging around in a Volkswagen
