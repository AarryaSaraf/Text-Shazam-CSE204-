// A Change Is Gonna Come //

You look good out there, baby

I was born by the river in a little tent
Oh, just like the river, I been running ever since
It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come
Oh, yes it will, look it here

It's been too hard living and I'm afraid to die
Look it here
Cuz I don't know what's up there beyond the sky
It's been a long
I wish I could come out there where you are baby
A long time coming but I know
Look it here
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will
Look it here

Let me say one more thing
I go to the movie and I go downtown
But I don't like it here
Somebody keep telling me oh boy, don't hang around
It's been a long, a long
If anybody know what I'm talking about
Lemme see you wave your hands
I know a chance gonna come, oh yes it will
But I gotta take, say this here

Then I go to my brother, yes sir
And I tell 'em, I say brother help me please
But he winds up knockin' me
He knocks me back down, back down on my
Oh there's been times that I fall
Somebody say yeah
Life could pass me on, no no
I know I'm able, I'm able, I'm able
I'm able to carry on
It's been a long, good God almighty
A long time coming but I know, yeah
A change is gonna come, oh yes it will
Look it here, one more time

Then I go to my brother
Somebody take your hands back and forth like this
Everybody, everybody
You sittin' in the first balcony too
All over the auditorium tonight
But he winds up knocking me down, my
Back down on, back down on my knee oh

I've been down but I thought I could last
Oh, I know I'm able, I'm able, I'm able
I know, I know, I know a change gonna come
And oh yes it will
Somebody say yeah
You all back here, lemme hear ya say yeah
Somebody say oh yeah
Somebody say oh yeah
Somebody say yeah
Whoa, right on

// Ain't No Sunshine //

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
It's not warm when she's away.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away.

Wonder, this time where she's gone,
Wonder if she's gonna stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
And this house just ain't no home,
Anytime she goes away.

And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, hey I ought to leave the young thing alone,

But ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness everyday.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,
And this house just ain't no home,
Anytime she goes away.

Anytime she goes away, anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away...

// Can't Take My Eyes Off You //

You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you
You feel like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
So darling feel like I feel
And I don't have to know if it's real
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you

Bada...

I love you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm a lonely night
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say

Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found this day
So let me love you baby
Let me love you

You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you
You feel like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you

Bada...

I love you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm a lonely night
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say

Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found this day
So let me love you baby
Let me love you

// Letter //

Give me a ticket for an airplane
I ain't got time to take a fast train
Oh ,the lonely days are gone
I'll be right home
My baby she wrote me a letter

I don't care how much money I got to spend
I won't find my way home again
Oh the lonely days are gone
I'll be right home
My baby, she wrote me a letter

She wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live with out me no more
Listen to me mister I gotta get back to
My baby once more
Anyway

Give me a ticket for an airplane
I ain't got time to take no fast train
Oh, the lonely days are gone
I'll be back home
My baby she wrote me a letter

She wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live with out me no more
Listen to me mister I gotta get back to
My baby once more
Anyway

Give me a ticket for an airplane
I ain't got time to take no fast train
Oh ,the lonely days are gone
I'll be back home
My baby she wrote me a letter

My baby wrote me a letter [repeats]

// Put A Little Love In Your Heart //

Think of your fellow man
Lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart

You see it's getting late
Oh please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place
For you and me
You just wait and see

Another day goes by
And still the children cry
Put a little love in you heart
If you want the world to know
We won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart

And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place
For you and me
You just wait and see
Wait and see

Take a good look around
And if you're lookin' down
Put a little love in your heart
I hope when you decide
Kindness will be your guide
Put a little love in your heart
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place
For you and me
You just wait and see
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your
Love in your heart
