// The Old Rugged Cross //

On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

// Precious Lord //

Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, let me stand
I'm tired, I'm weak, I'm lone
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

When my way grows drear precious Lord linger near
When my life is almost gone
Hear my cry, hear my call, hold my hand lest I fall
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

When the darkness appears and the night draws near
And the day is past and gone
At the river I stand, guide my feet, hold my hand
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

Precious Lord, take my hand
Lead me on, let me stand
I'm tired, I'm weak, Lord I'm worn
Through the storm, through the night
Lead me on to the light
Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home

// How Great Thou Art //

O Lord my God!  When I in awesome wonder 
Consider all the worlds thy hands have made,
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, 
Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed

Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
How great thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
How great thou art, how great Thou art!

When through the woods and forest glades I wonder 
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze;

Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
How great thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
How great thou art, how great Thou art!

And when I think that God, his Son not sparing, 
Sent him to die, I scarce can take it in; 
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing, 
He bled and died to take away my sin

Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
How great thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
How great thou art, how great Thou art!

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!

Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
How great You are, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Savior God to thee
How great You are, how great Thou art!

// What A Friend We Have In Jesus //

What a Friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry 
Everything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness:
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weary and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour, still our Refuge-
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer!
In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there.

// In The Garden //

I come to the garden alone while the dew is still on the roses,
And the voice I hear falling on my ear, the Son of God discloses.

And he walks with me, and he talks with me,
And he tells me I am his own;
And the joy we share as we tarry there,
None other has ever known.

He speaks, and the sound of his voice is so sweet the birds hush their singing,
And the melody that he gave to me within my heart is ringing.

And he walks with me, and he talks with me,
And he tells me I am his own;
And the joy we share as we tarry there,
None other has ever known.

I'd stay in the garden with him though the night around me falling,
But he bids me go; thru the voice of woe his voice to me is calling.

And he walks with me, and he talks with me,
And he tells me I am his own;
And the joy we share as we tarry there,
None other has ever known.
