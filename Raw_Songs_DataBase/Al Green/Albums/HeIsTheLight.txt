// Going Away //

Life can be hard if you live in vain
Trials can't be hard if you depend on God
I will not worry, I won't be afraid of hope
I'll look to Jesus who says, 'I'm the Way'

Come and go with me to my Father's house
Let's go, let's go
All the road is free, come and go with me
Let's go, let's go, I'm going away, I'm going away

It's nothing but peace
When you're gone away
It's nothing but joy
When you are gone away

Let me tell you
You'd better go this way, if your woman see the day
Let her go, let's go
All the road is free, come and go with me
Let's go, I'm going away, I'm going away

Hey, hey, [?]
And I won't be there, I'm going away
I don't know about you
I find you're nothing but joy, I'm going away

We'll pack my bags up
With the soul that I've had, I'm going away
Nothing but love over there
Sometime I happen to [?]
I'm going away

I'm still way by myself
And I say, I'm going away
I still wait by myself
As I, I'm going away

I'll tell you one thing
There's nothing but love and joy
[?] I'm going away
All the way

I have to love you
I'm going away, I'm going away
Jesus' coming back to take me by the hand
To lead me to the land, I'm going away

// I Feel Like Going On //

I feel like going on, yes, I do
I said, I, I feel like going on, ohh
Ohh, I, I feel like shouting for joy
I don't know 'bout you
Ohh, I, I feel like shouting for joy, yes I do

Ohh, I feel like shouting for joy
I feel like shouting for joy
I feel like shouting for joy

Ohh, I, I feel like going on
I believe I move on up
Hey I, I feel like going on

Ohh, I feel like going on
I feel like going on, gotta move on
I feel like going on

I feel like going on
I feel like going on
I feel like going on

Ohh, I, I feel like going on, yes I do
I don't know 'bout you
Ohh, I, I feel like going on, yes I do
And I gotta move

Ohh I, I feel like shouting for joy
I don't mind at all, now
Ohh, I, I feel like shouting for joy
Yes, I do

I'm takin' my time, packin' my bags
Movin' on, movin' on, movin' up the [?]
Takin' my time, packin' my bags
Sayin' hello to the friends along the way

Oh I, I feel like, I don't know 'bout you tonight but I, hey
I, I feel, feel like movin' movin' movin', movin' up

// Nearer My God To Thee //

Nearer, nearer

The minister was preaching
And the crowd was standing near
The congregation sang in a tune
In the hall, it was loud and clear

All of the crowd that stood all around him
They were crying as I could plainly see
Oh, the songs that they sang was so touching
They were singing to my God to Thee

Nearer my God to thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee

Kept on singing
Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee

Sometimes, I like to be in company
But when I get out, I like to stay out for long
Song is the only thing that can control me, Lord
When I know trouble, trouble's about to come

I fall down on my knees and call God late at night
And I know He'll make my, my burdens alright
I tell him, Lord, I have a desire to be
Nearer, nearer my God to Thee, Alleluia

Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee

Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee

I remember I was a little boy
Mother still used to [?]
I used to wonder what my mother was doing, have mercy, Lord
I stepped out one morning found mother all folded up

And mother had to rise up, she was looking towards the sky
And I saw the tears as they fell down my mothers eyes
And I can still hear the song mother was singing
Nearer my God to Thee

Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee, nearer to Thee
Nearer to Thee
