Album: CallMe

// Call Me (Come Back Home) //

Call me

What a beautiful time we had together
Now it's getting late and we must leave each other (yeah)
Just remember the time we had
And how right I tried to be
It's all in a day's work

Call me

Losing your love, acting foolishly
Go on and take your time
'Cause you're only losing me
Love is a long ways from here
Tell you, it's all in the way you feel
If your love is real

Come to me
(Call me)
Come back home

The best thing I can do is give you your love
(give you your love)
Let you go on your way
Feeling as free as a dove
And if you find you're a long ways from home
And somebody's doing you wrong

Just call on me baby
Come back home
(Call me)

When you're worried
Things ain't going right
It's all in a day's work
Call me
When you're lonely
You can call me
When you're feeling sad
It's all in a day's work

Come back home
(Call me)

// Have You Been Making Out O.K. //

Have you been making out okay?

Hey girl, I don't wanna change you now
I wanna know how you been making out
How you been?
Did the morning sun warm your soul?
Did he make you happy? Did he make you whole?

Have you been making out okay?

Hey girl, since you been away with him
My life has been cloudy and days been awful dim
But you're looking well
Baby, would you rather be there with him?
Would you reconsider and come running back to me?

Have you been making out okay?
Have you been making out okay? (I wanna know)
Have you been making out okay?

Have you been making out okay? (I wanna know)
Have you been making out okay? (I just want to know)
Have you been making out okay?

Hey baby, stopped by just to say
While I was on my way
Stopped by today just to see how you was getting along
I wanna know, can you make it on your own, baby?
On your own, baby
Have you been making out okay? (I wanna know)
Have you been making out okay? (Won't you tell me tell me?)
Have you been making out okay?

// Stand Up //

Stand up, and identify yourself
Stand up, and identify yourself

What's your name, what's the nature
of the game, who you are
How far you come, where have you been

Stand up, you've been promised just one day
And that's today
Stand up, no sense in sleeping your life away

Where you going, what's your plan
If you a loser or a winning man
Tell me now, I wanna know
You've got to let the glory show

Stand up, tomorrow's about to come
Are you ready
Stand up, today's got you on the run

Don't fall down on your face
and let someone take your place
Cause you oughta know, you can do it
Tell me that there's nothing to it

Where you going, do you know
Did you're friends tell you so
Can you make it by yourself
With the strength that you have left

Why don't you give me a hand
I'll try my best to understand
I don't know about goodbye
But nothing fails but a try

// I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry //

Did you hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too good to fly
The midnight train whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry, cry

Did you ever seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind a cloud
And I'm so lonesome that I feel I could cry, I could cry

Did you see, ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die?
Like me he's lost the will to live
And I'm so lonesome I could cry
[?] I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder, wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry, cry, I could cry

And as I wonder, wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
If you let me, oh no
[?]
I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
It seems to me
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I could cry, I could cry

// Your Love Is Like The Morning Sun //

Look at the morning sun, shining so brightly
Love is in the air, I don't care
Look at the smiling faces, 
Makes me know that no one can take your place, your place, your place

Love is the morning sun, shining so brightly
It's me that's missing your love, now

All the skies are gray, now messing up my day
I'd never leave you in this leave, oh no never never
Throwing up my hands, not being a man
Don't you know that's not going to pay

Love is the morning sun, shining so brightly
It's me that's missing your love, now
I'm tired of being alone, bye
Still in love with you, now
Let's stay together, together

// Here I Am (Come And Take Me) //

I can't believe that it's real
The way that you make me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide

Our love is you and me, baby
That make the world go round
And if keeping you and loving you means 
Layin' all my troubles down

Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby, come and take me
Take me by the hand
Show me
Here I am, baby

It always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
A love that I cannot have
You broke my heart into half

Our love is you and me, baby
That make the world go round
Keeping you and loving you means 
Laying all my troubles down

Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby, come and take me
Take me by the hand
Show me
Here I am, baby

When I'm down I can always call you
For a helpin' hand
I know you'll do the best you can
But it don't take much for me
Before my cup runs over
All this love inside of me
I believe there's going to be an explosion

You can talk to me (oh, baby)
I'm in no hurry 
Tell me all your troubles
And you won't ever have to worry (no)
(And one more thing)
You just can't trust everybody
Everybody you see (no no)
You'll find yourself lost and alone
On a darkened street

Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby, would you come and take me?
Take me by the hand
Show me
Take me
Show me, won't you?
Here I am, baby
Take me, won't you?
Teach me
Won't you take me by the hand?
Teach me
Here I am, baby

// Funny How Time Slips Away //

Well hello there
My, it's been a long time
How am I doin'
Well, I guess I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now and it seems like
It was only yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away

How's your new love
I hope he's doin' fine
I heard you told him
You're gonna love him till the end of time
I remember that's the same thing
That you told me yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away

I gotta go now
Well, I'll see you hanging round
Don't know when though
Never know when I'll be back in town
Remember what I told you
That in time you're gonna pay

Well ain't it funny how time slips away
Yeah, ain't it funny how time slips away

// You Ought To Be With Me //

Sit right down and talk to me
About how you want to be
You ought to be with me
Yeah, you ought to be with me

Thinking 'bout what people do
Talking 'bout how I love you
Thinking there's nothing to what they say
You're going to be with me anyway

They don't want to see us do
All of the things we want to
You ought to be with me
Hey, you ought to be with me

You don't have to waste my time
If you want to be a friend of mine
You can leave me now and walk away
And turn your back for another day

Let me say it:
Ought to be the kind of girl
That can brighten this old world
And it's hard to see why you and me
Can't be together happily

I'm trying to realize
You being with some other guy
I don't know the reason why
You ought to be with me until I die

(Hey, you ought to be with me until I die)

I don't want to waste my time
If you want to be a friend of mine
I want to hold you tight, love you right
Put good feelin' in your night

// Jesus Is Waiting //

Jesus is waiting
And if you're broken down
Jesus is waiting, hey yea
Don't let yourself down

Oh He standing right there behind you

Helping you to make up your mind

Do I have to say it again (say it again)
Jesus is waiting, Hey

Talking bout, you've got a friend
I believe it this evening
I just want you to know

Reach down in your heart and say
A little prayer just for me
He's the One that believes in love
Can't you see

Hey - Thank you
Hey - Thank you

Jesus is waiting, Jesus is waiting
What I want you to do is just
Help me, Help me
Help me, Help me
Help me, Help me
Help me, Help me

Help me, I'll help you,
Jesus, save my soul
I'll live for You
I'll do my best to just
Do what I can to
Stand up and be a man
I said Hey...

I just want everybody to know that
Jesus is waiting, Hey
Jesus is waiting

I wish the band would just [4x]
Bring way down
I said I've been a fool
Disregarding Your love
Hey Father, I just want to tell You
That, I'm Sorry, (Sorry) Sorry, (Sorry)
Sorry (Sorry) Sorry Hey...

You've been good to me
You've been good to me
You've been good to me
You've been good to me

Thank You, thank You
Thank You, thank You
Thank You, thank You
Thank You, thank You

Hey...
