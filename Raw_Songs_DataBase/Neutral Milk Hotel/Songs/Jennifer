I bring Jennifer flowers
I bring Jennifer cupcakes
I bring Jennifer snow cones
I bring Jennifer yard rakes
And we dance in the leaves
That go up to our knees
And I cough and I sneeze
Only for Jennifer

I bring Jennifer wine
I bring Jennifer apple peels
For that's all that she needs for a good time
And we put on our pants
And we sing and we dance
As the sun wanders past
Above me and Jennifer

I bring Jennifer sailboats
And Jennifer brings me the sky
We swim through a sea of artichokes
Awaiting the day we'll die
And the trumpets will blow
And the water will flow
And a flower will grow
Above me and Jennifer

Jennifer
Jennifer
