Say goodnight
Like a ship at sea
And walk away
From a world that does not believe
Say- say goodnight
And open up your arms
It's a beautiful life
And I'm sitting in a jar
So what was me, I do believe
That my pants are all rolled up
And I think it's time
I gave up my sanity

Good and good for ya, 'cause it's made with milk
