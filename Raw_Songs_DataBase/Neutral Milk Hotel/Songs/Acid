I feel a fading here
I feel it everyday
It's just a shaking fear 
That hits when I awake
This pain has found me here
Always and all too waiting 
And if I disappear into your hiding place...

She had a mental problem
She couldn't concentrate
She was her own delusion
She was her own mistake
She did a lot of acid
That put the voices down
And one day at her birthday
They found her hanging upside down

They say she lived her life on the avenue
They say she cried from the weight of her spit
They claim they were the only ones that she ever knew
Ah, but why are they weeping now?
When she was alive they were not around
They were locked in their own abyss

We met in the gutter
We shared a smoke or two
I told about my mother
She showed me her tattoo
We wandered through the city
Got lost in Fulton Town
And one day at her birthday
They found her hanging upside down

They say she live her life an American
They say she whored herself for pills
They claim they offered her their helping hand
But their talk's all the same to me
To call themselves her family
It just makes me ill
