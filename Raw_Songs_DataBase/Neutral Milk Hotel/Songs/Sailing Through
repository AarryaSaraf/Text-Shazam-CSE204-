Sailing through
Your disease and you. your disease and you
Your body like a basket
Shivering in static for us in this place of angry tears
All those years you were alive inside the closet
But nobody in it there but me
But now you are coming
Life is off running
You're tearing yourself apart at the seams
And You are a liar You are a liar
You are a liar and you are a lie
You are a liar
You are a liar
Now I'm off sailing
Sickness inhaling
Every drop of blood you could bleed
The world is all coming
They're Coming of millions
The billions of people to sick to believe
And I really wanted just to be in your body
To be in your body
To be inside you
I really wanted to be in your body
To share in your sickness
The shield around you
You are a liar You are a liar
You are a liar and you are a lie
You are a liar You are a liar
You are a liar and you are a liar
Wrapped you up in masters
They Cover you in plaster
They Spit in your mouth and then say I love you
Is this supposed to save us
Is this supposed to break us
Into the toilet without faces removed
And I really wanted just be in your body
If i could only be in your body
If i could only be inside you
I really wanted to be in your body
Into the toilet with faces removed
You are a liar You are a liar
You are a liar and you are a lie
You are a liar You are a liar
You are a liar and you are a lie
You are a liar You are a liar
You are a liar and you are a lie
You are a liar you are a liar
And you are a liar
