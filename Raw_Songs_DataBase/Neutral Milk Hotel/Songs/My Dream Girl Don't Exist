My dream girl don't exist
And at the age of five she slit her wrist
She didn't know that I'd be hanging around
So her parents buried her in the ground
And this day I can still hear the sound
Of a life in outer space

My dream girl don't exist 
It just you and I and this TV
And this illness seems to feel so strange
Like a henchman that's about to hang
The moon up like a ball and chain
And set its sands ablaze

And the weight is waiting off
Feel the world so real and strong 

My dream girl don't exist
Just a photograph in a history book
And I believe she had a voice and name
Three children on the coast of Maine
And her life was in a hurricane
Of love and real embrace

My dream girl don't exist
And at the age of five she slit her wrist
She didn't know that I'd be hanging around
So one day she took a stroll to town
And walked in front of a Greyhound bound
For New York Central State

And the weight is waiting off
And the weight is waiting off
Feel the world so real and strong
She goes, and now she knows
She'll never be afraid
