Everything is made of water
Seeping deep within your soul
And as you're sleeping safe tomorrow
The flowers in your heart will overflow

Sweet Marie with your raspberry sunshine
Won't you take me where I've never known
I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Like the weeds grow in my mind
I know you, know you like the wind as it's blown

Everything is made of water
Seeping deep within your soul
And as you're sleeping safe tomorrow
The flowers in your heart will overflow

Dream of me when the day sings of sunshine
Dream of me when your lucks gone away
I'll show you, show you, show you, show you, show you
How the snow falls in your mind
I know you, know you're gonna find it some day

Everything is made of water
Seeping deep within your soul
And as you're sleeping safe tomorrow
The flowers in your heart will overflow

The fall is not as hard as they told you so
A love will soon define a place to grow

Lonely child of dreams
Won't you ever dream of me
Won't you love me like a ship
Setting sail upon the sea
And don't you ever feel afraid
Of falling like a hate parade
Hoping someone will love you
Someone will love you soon

Lonely child of eyes
Won't you ever follow me
Into an evening sky
Into a make believe
Where hands they hold on true
And flowers blow tiny balloons
And no ones lonely
When no one is an only one

The sun will fall
The day will fade
And I will join the hate parade
And I will love a heart untrue
That's slipping softly from my room
