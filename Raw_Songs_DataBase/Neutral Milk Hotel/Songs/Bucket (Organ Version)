Shadows on my wall
They creep and crawl on through the night
They dream of waterfalls
Catching small, bright streams of light

Life can be so weird
A bucket full of tears
But it's all right
I've seen the light
And I've still got time to fly away

Shadows in my dreams
They're painting scenes of time with you
I'm hoping all these things
And strength it brings will see me through

And life can be so weird
A bucket full of tears
But it's all right
I've seen the light
And I've still got time to fly away
