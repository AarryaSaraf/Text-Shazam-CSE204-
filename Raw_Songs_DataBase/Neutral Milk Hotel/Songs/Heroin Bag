It's come and gone
And it's a million miles away
The dress she wore is all that shall remain
And a clear blue sky
It turns in my memory
But now you find it stays, they come
And remain unchanged

Don't push me too far
You'll never get anywhere like that
They're gonna dry you up and drown you
Deep inside the heroin bag

It's come and gone
And it's never coming home
You push to far and then you break the bone
And a clear blue sky
It turns in my memory
But now you find it stays, they come
And leave you alone

Don't push me too far
You'll never get anywhere like that
They're gonna dry you up and drown you
Deep inside the heroin bag

So long now
There's not a flower left in you
It's just your eyes and now they're made of stone
And a clear blue sky
It turns in my memory
But then you get it on, get it on and then it's
Right on your own

Don't push me too far
You'll never get anywhere like that
They're gonna dry you up and drown you
Deep inside the heroin bag
