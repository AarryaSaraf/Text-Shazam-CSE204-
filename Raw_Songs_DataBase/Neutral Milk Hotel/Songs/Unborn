A candy coated dream
With parks and trees and figurines
And her arms wrap round my sleeve
With tiny steps and eyes of green
Toy guitar that's out of tune
Eyes fixed on morning time cartoons
And by the lantern of the moon
I will dream of a love like you

And will you hang up high
A family portrait smile
Will you kiss my child
As she is dancing now?
This figure I will frame
A life without a name
But this thought I proclaim
I'm just romancing now
I'm only chancing now

A candy coated dream 
With hearts and string and angel wings
And her life will fall between
The cracks that follow you and me

Will you hang up high
A family portrait smile
Will you kiss my child
As she is dancing now?
This figure I will frame
A life without a name
But this thought I proclaim
I'm just romancing now
I'm only chancing now
