Let the world collapse and die
It's sinking deeper in your eyes
And I will sing a sweet surprise for no one

Let the world collapse and swallow
All the love she'll hold tomorrow
And I will shield and I will follow no one

And I'm all screwed up
But I feel all right
Sinking deeper all the time
Inside a hole deep in my mind
But I love you, I love you
More than life

Let the world collapse and fold
It gave me no, nothing at all
And I will shield and I will fall for no one

Let it sink and let it shudder
All the words that I will mutter
In hopes your love will soon discover no one

And I'm all screwed up
But I feel all right
Sinking deeper all the time
Inside a hole deep in my mind
But I love you, I love you,
Oh I love you, yes I love you,
Oh I love you
More than life

More than life 
More than life 
More than life
