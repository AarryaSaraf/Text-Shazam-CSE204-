Through all my phasing times
There was a phase to separate
The heavens from the other place (and)
The feelings all inside, can't express the
Joy you bring so this my love is why
I sing for you, for you
I sing this song for you (I sing this song, ah ah), for you
For You ooooo

With all that we've been through
No one can say that we have changed
The love we had it still remains (and)
With that you filled my life
(A kiss from me is not enough, ah ah)
A kiss from me is not enough to show you that I'm living just
For you, it's true
I'm living just for you (I'm living just, ah ah), for you
For You ooo

You're the meaning in my life
(For You) For you (All things I would do) I would do
In all the many ways to show my love for you
This is one I thought I'd do (This is one I'd do, ah) Yeah hey

(I'd sing this song for you and me)
For you (I'd sing this song for you)
I'd sing this song for you baby
(I'd sing this song for you and me, I'd sing this song for you)
For You ooo, For you ooo!
