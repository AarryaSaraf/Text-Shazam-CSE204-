New York, New York, I love New York
New York, New York, I love New York

Go ride, go ride
Don't feel uptight
Go right, go left
There's no place else
New York's a place
A special place
With art all around
The best around

New York, New York, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York, New York

Disco all night
Your taste delight
Broadway the lights
All shine at night
All kinds of girls
The best in the world
Talk loud, wear new
Where who is who
All kinds of food
To fit your mood
So much to do
So just be you

New York, New York, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York, New York

The fashion the cash
The cars the bars
Fashions are new
Made just for you
You'll find a star
And won't look far
Maybe you'll see
Miss Liberty
Wall Street is there
In all you'll stare
So much to see
For you and me

New York, New York, I love New York
New York, New York, I love New York
New York, New York, I love New York
New York, New York, I love New York

New York, New York, I love New York
New York, New York, I love New York
New York, New York, I love New York
New York, New York, I love New York

New York, New York, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York, New York
