Knights, knights, knights, knights
Knights, knights, knights, knights

Please don't think we're crazy
If you see us walk and talk
(I can dig it)
We're the knights and we know this
And we take things as they come, oh, yeah

We are the knights by nights
(I'm a knight)
And we can make things right
(We can make it right)
Sending love to all our friends
(All our friends)
Stay with you till the end, alright

Knights by nights
(Knights by nights)
Knights by nights
(I'm walkin' tall)
Knights by nights
(Knights by nights)
Knights by nights

What you say?
Come on, knights

So few say you can dig it
But do you really understand
We're dedicated to the rhythm for your nation
But every person must be tall, be strong

We are the knights by nights
And we can make things right
(We can make it right)
Sending love to all our friends
(All our friends)
Stay with you till the end

Knights by nights
(We are the knights)

(Hey, hey, knights)
