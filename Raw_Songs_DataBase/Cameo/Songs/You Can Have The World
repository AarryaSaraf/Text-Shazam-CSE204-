Some people say that this is the truth
There are no genes everlastin' yet
If they live like us it wouldn't be hard to tell
Just what is heaven and where is hell

So keep on the good good
Be happy
Your genes are yours to keep
Don't be a victim now of these mean sticks

If there's a world of trouble to bust your punches
To be new
Keep the faith baby it can happen for you

You can have the world
If you want it
Don't make circumstances stop you
Opportunity will rock you
Have the world
If you want it
(Chances are you'll find)
You're gonna make it

Gonna make it through
You're gonna make it through yeah
Yeah

The best that you can do
Everything will come to you
Stop procrastinatin'
Your neck of all

If you wonder why I understand
Take the time to comb your hair
Wash your face and hands
Look the best you can
It takes a minute to find
Success and a peace of mind
If you harp it you can do it
If you put your heart into it
Just get a picture in your mind
Get very detailed what to find
And chances are you're gonna find

You can have the world
If you want it
Don't make circumstances stop you
Opportunity will rock you
Have the world
If you want it
(Chances are you'll find)
You're gonna make it

Have the world
You're gonna make it
