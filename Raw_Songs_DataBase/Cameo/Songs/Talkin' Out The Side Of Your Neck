So you can see we're back into this same old mess?
Seems like every time we get out of one situation
We're back into it all over again

All you people that watch you talk
You better get it together or we won't get it done
We sit down while you cuss and fuss
But guess who's suffering, nobody but us

Now we're a dedicated people and we do our job
But the harder we work the game gets hard to beat
One for all and all for one but it's harder to play
When you can't have fun

Hey, you talking out the side of your neck
Hey your gonna get what's comin' to you yet

You carry the weight but we carry the force
And that's ain't fair so stop rockin' the boat
You think you get away with political crimes
But don't take this for granted

Just get out of my house, now some of the people
Some of the times but not all of your people all of the time
Trick you get, bored too, General Matt Conrad
Ronnie Reagen too

Hey, you talking out the side of your neck
Hey your gonna get what's comin' to you yet

Cligdi, cling die? Clindi? Hosh posh?
Clinge ding? Cling me die? Clinge ding?
Horns? Hoshpsh?

Hey, you talking out the side of your neck
Hey your gonna get what's comin' to you yet

Hey, you talking out the side of your neck
Hey your gonna get what's comin' to you yet

Hey, you talking out the side of your neck
Hey your gonna get what's comin' to you yet
