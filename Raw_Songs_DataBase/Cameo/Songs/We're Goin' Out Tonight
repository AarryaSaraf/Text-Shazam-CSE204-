We're going out tonight
And I want my friends to know
'Cause you look just right
And my feelings start to show

I owe it all to you and I'm sure
I'll do the things you want me too

You shocked me, amazed me
You blew me away, hey
As I stand next to you, you make me nervous
I can't see a thing in front of me

For days and days
I can't forget you, no, no, no
My friends ask me why
My God, you've got me high

All the things I want
I find them hard to get
But now my luck has changed
And I knew that when we met

We're going out tonight
And we'll stand up in the crowd
'Cause we're dressed real nice
Even Gucci would be proud

I don't mind telling you
You look good
You look so good
So good to me

Your vibrations move me
Sentimentality grooves me
I hung up on this lovely girl

I've never seen us like this
Your teeth as white as pearls
Hey baby, you're the wonder of my world

When we step out tonight
The people will applaud
The girls will say, "My my"
And the guys will say, "Oh, Lord"

I'm in heaven, heaven
I'm in heaven
Heaven, heaven
Heaven's just for me

Heaven, heaven
I'm in heaven
Heaven, heaven
Heaven's just for me

I thank the Lord for what he's given me
Oh, it feels so nice to be
I'm in heaven
I'm in heaven, yeah

Ooh, oh, oh, oh, I'm in paradise
And you know if feels so nice
Yeah, I'll never let you go
And I want the world to know

Heaven, heaven
I'm in heaven
Heaven, heaven
Heaven's just for me
