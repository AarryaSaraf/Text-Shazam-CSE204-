You're wishing on a star
It's the only one that sits there
Next to the silvery moon
I don't feel too optimistic
But I know I'd trade the world
For what I am wishing would come true

I know you told me more than twice
Of the fate that I'd been dreading
But if you walk right up to me tonite
Would you doubt that I'd be ready
So I walk the city streets
Wishing you were here with me
Falling in love again
(baby until then)

I'll be hangin' downtown
Kind of waiting
Maybe I'll try meditating
I'll be hangin downtown
Kind of waiting
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Been tied to lonesome roads
Making residence in two bit 4 wall domeciles
Never time for what is needed
So I grab a bite to eat
Then maybe grab a smile

So hard to give it up

You know I tried so many times before
Any price of sacrifice 
To see you walkin thru the door
Girl I'm tryin to make you see
I'd rather have you here with me
Fallin in love again
(baby until them)

I'll be hangin' downtown
Kind of waiting
Maybe I'll try meditating
I'll be hangin downtown
Kind of waiting
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Though I walk the city streets
I'd rather have you here with me
Falling in love again
(baby until then)

I'll be hangin' downtown
Kind of waiting
Maybe I'll try meditating
I'll be hangin downtown
Kind of waiting
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
