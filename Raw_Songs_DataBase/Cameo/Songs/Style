Style, burn me up
Style, hand it down
Style, burn me up
Style, hand it down

Gotta get a message straight across to you
Put a little a class in everything you do
The way you walk, talk, and the way you dress
Gonna put a little distance between you and the rest
Well it's that style (Style)
That makes you stand out from the crowd
(Style)
Get your point across without ever talking loud
If respect's what you want, then that's what you get
(Style, whoo)
You can work a sweat without ever getting wet
Ho

If you think that you're undesired
Then you'll soon see
Personality is the way to get by it
You will work it out
(Work it out)
(Now's the time for)
Time to get
(Serious)
Keep it all together
'Cause with style comes class

Style, burn me up
Style, hand it down
Style, burn me up
Style, hand it down

Gotta be a hero, change some point of views
Gotta set a trend and just make it be the news
Use your charm, your wit, your personality
To cure the cats' curiosity
Well it's that style that you read about in all the magazines
All that looks good might not be what it seems
Some think you learn it from the books
Either you have it or you don't
You'll get it or you won't

Use it, then lose it, they won't reintroduce it
What you need is your panache to earn the rank of class
Now's the time for
(Time to get)
Serious (Serious)
Keep it all together
'Cause with style comes class

Scratch
Style
