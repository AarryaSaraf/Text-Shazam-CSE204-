I've peeped through open doors
Looked here and there and then some more
Who else can it be
When you're sure you've tried it all and all

Did you ever know
That you'd find a friend
And did you ever dream
He would be with you thick and thin
Catch me if I fall
We've nothing to fear at all
Oh cause we have made it grow
And we've learned what there is to know

If you let it be - so unselfishly
You'll be a friend to me
When your heart's full of love
There's a well you're giving of
It's yours for free
It has no end

Did you ever know
That you'd find a friend, find a friend yeah
And did you ever dream, yeah dream
He would be with you thick and thin
Hey catch me if I fall
Cause we've nothing to fear at all
Cause we have made it grow, yes we did
And we've learned what there is to know
Yeah

If you let it be - unselfishly
A friend to me
When your heart's full of love
There's a well you're giving of
It's yours for free, yours for free
