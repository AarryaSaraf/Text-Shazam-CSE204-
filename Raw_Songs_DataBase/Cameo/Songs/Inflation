Up against the wall, turkey
What? Up against the wall?

A dollar bill can buy you a meal
But the meal just ain't worth havin'
A dollar bill can't buy you a meal
'Cause a dollar bill just ain't no deal

Almighty dollar
Never seem to make it (Almighty dollar)
Almighty dollar, oh yeah
Government make us take it (Almighty dollar)

I sacrifice to feed my wife
What can I do? Lord, what can I do?
Yeah, uh huh, yeah, yeah

Inflation
Sweeping 'cross the nation
Inflation'
(Can't get enough food to eat, yeah)
I ain't got no shoes on my feet

Got my woman on the pill, hey
Inflation
(Taxes going up so high, well)
I can't afford to die

What you say?
You know what man, I said: "Two dollars for a pack of cigarettes, what?""
I said, "Man, you must be crazy, do they do dishes?"

Almighty dollar
Never seem to make it (Almighty dollar)
Almighty dollar, oh yeah
Government make us take it (Almighty dollar)

I sacrifice to feed my wife
What can I do? Lord, what can I do?
Yeah, uh huh, yeah, yeah

Everything going up
Going up
Going up, going up
