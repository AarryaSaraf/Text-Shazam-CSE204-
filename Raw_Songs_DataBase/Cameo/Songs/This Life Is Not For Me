This life is not for me
No
No
As far as I can see
No
No
This job is all I see
Oh
No
There must be more for me
(Yeah)

Boogie with my baby is what I need to do
But I'm stuck in this place with a jive interview
I need to party to circulate my blood
With Bobby, Kim and Sue and the rest of the crew
Don't tell me your problems, I've got some for myself
'Cause who's gonna love you if you don't love yourself
That foot-stomping rhythm will take care of my ails
'Cause there's much more to life than paying bills

This life is not for free
No
No
You'll turn into a freak
Oh
No
This ain't the place to be
No
No
As far as I can see
(Yeah)

Taking care of business is the only thing we know
'Cause no matter what the weather we say 'On with the show'
It ain't no secret to the magic that we make
When we look in the crowd and see the smiles on their face
The atmosphere's electric, 'cause we really take charge
When we come on right after Bobby DeBarge
That foot-stomping rhythm will take care of my ails
'Cause there's much more to life than paying bills

This life is not for me
No
No
As far as I can see
No
No
This job is all I see
Oh
No
There must be more for me
(Yeah)

This life is not for free
No
No
You'll turn into a freak
Oh
No
This ain't the place to be
No
No
As far as I can see
(Yeah)
