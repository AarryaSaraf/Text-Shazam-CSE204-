Whisper softly in my ear
Make my dreams come true
Dancing lightly meet the mood inside my mind
Above my pillow smiling brightly down at you

Your name always on my mind
And in my heart it's true
Come delight me in the dark, inside my love
Beside my pillow now
I'll give it all to you

I don't care if you don't love me like you say
'Cause I'm gonna love you anyway
'Cause I'm gonna love you anyway

Take my heart down off the shelf
Use your love as the key
Please unlock me from the pain to which I'm bound
You won't regret the time you shared your love with me, oh yeah

I don't care if you don't love me like you say
'Cause I'm gonna love you anyway
'Cause I'm gonna love you anyway

I don't care if you don't love me like you say
'Cause I'm gonna love you anyway
'Cause I'm gonna love you anyway

If you don't go, I'll try to show you
All the love you need
You never know, all the love you need
Girl you should know all the love you need
