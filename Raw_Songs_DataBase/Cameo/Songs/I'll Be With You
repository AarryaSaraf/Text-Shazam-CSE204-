If you see what you want
You can get it
To philosophize and prophesy
Won't get it, no
I'll stay with you
Till I can't take it no more
And if I see these things won't change
I'll be walking out that door
But in the meantime

I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you

You complain when I go out with all my friends
Tell me when do you think this foolishness will end
I never thought things could always be this bad
But two years is enough to tell me I've been had

I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
