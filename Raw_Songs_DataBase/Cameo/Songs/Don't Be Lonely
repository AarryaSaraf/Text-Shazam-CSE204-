Monday morning
And I find myself missing you
I'm thinking of you and your new lover
Playing it cool
Even though you tore my heart apart

I start my day just like any other day
And when the phone rings on the other end
You say, now I realize that I made the wrong move
To take you back in my life, girl
I can't see it coming through

Remembering times
We both knew we would regret
How we feel is not the issue, girl
What would you do if you were in my shoes

You can just stop trying to find a way
Back into my heart
I was never one to take two steps back
And I'll never start
After all the changes you took me through
Don't entertain the thought

I got real strong advice
And I'd like to give it to you

Don't be lonely
You're not the only one who feels the way you do
Don't be lonely
You're not the only one who's heart been broken too

I got real strong advice
And I'd like to give it to you
You're not the only one
Who's heart been broken too

Hi, long time no see
Looks like you've lost a best friend
I can understand it
I've been under the weather a bit myself

Hey, let's stop kidding ourselves
You know I've been a little crazy lately
Since we stopped seein' each other
I guess you would've never known
That unless we got a chance to talk

Don't be lonely
You're not the only one who feels the way you do
Don't be lonely
You're not the only one who's heart been broken too

Yes, ah
