Hey, hey, hey, yeah
I wanna tell ya
Hey, yeah, ah ha
I'm here to tell ya

You try to be so cold
Right down to your very soul
Your curiosity elapse late
But now I'm leaving that all in the past

I wanna see
If it still
Still feels good to me
Right now I'm gonna check it out
And when I'm through there'll be no doubt
Cause I intend to call it like it is

Hey
Still feels good to me
Hey
Yeah, hey, hey


Just like curiosity killed the cat
Satisfaction brought him back
We both know it's the only reason
I got that 
Ha

Hey
Yeah, hey
Hey

I wanna see
If it still
Still feels good
Still feels good to me
Right now I'm gonna check it out
But when I'm through there'll be no doubt
No, cause I intend to call it like it is

I wanna see, I wanna see
If it still
Still feels good to me
Right now I'm gonna check it out
But when I'm through there'll be no doubt
No, cause I intend to call it like it is
I wanna see

I wanna see
Feels good to me
I wanna see
Feels good to me
I wanna see
Feels good to me
I wanna see
Feels good to me






I wanna see
If it still
Still feels good to me
Right now I'm gonna check it out
But when I'm through there'll be no doubt
Cause I intend to call it like it is
I wanna see, I wanna see
If it's still, if it's still
Still feels good to me
Right now I'm gonna check it out
But when I'm through there'll be no doubt
Cause I intend to call it like it is

I wanna see
Feels good to me
I wanna see
Feels good to me
I wanna see
Feels good to me
I wanna see
Feels good to me
