Thank you love for caring all this time
For every passing moment along the line
I use to take this kind of love for granted, how I was wrong
and now that I've been all around I've come back to you


And I'll never, ever look, look for love outside OUR DOOR
Here's the love we've waited for, what's in the past will be no more
I'm FOR you


let me hold you sweetheart just this time
To remind us of what we mean to each other
How can we let go when this is the only love we'll ever, ever want to know
People say all things change, but our love will never say the same.....



Outside ooooh oooooh oooooh
Let me hold you for this moment woah, woah, woah
Here's the love we've waited for, what's in the past will be no more
I..I..I..I..I..I..I..I..lovvve you
I-I-I really dooooo
