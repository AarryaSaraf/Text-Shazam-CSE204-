Your smile is like a shining sun
It follows me
And the movements of your body
Always makes me lose myself

But oh, just how lucky can one be
Chills run over me
And I dig myself
We've danced awhile
Disco hustling's our style
And you, you and me

When those glittered lights hit ya
It really shows what your body can do girl
With that dazzle in your eye
The places you took me left me high
Oh yeah

But oh, just how lucky can one be
Chills run over me
And I dig myself, ha
We've dance awhile
Disco style, hustling
And you, you and me

When those glittered lights hit ya
It really shows what your body can do girl
And with that dazzle in your eye
The places you took me left me high
Oh yeah

You took awhile
Just to smile girl

Come on dance with me
Don't leave me girl
Good, you look so good
