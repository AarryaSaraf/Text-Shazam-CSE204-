Searching
Looking to the sky
We've got our heads up high
We're doing fine
Laughing
With no intent to cry
We'll keep on stepping by
We're doing fine

Talkin' 'bout that weird feeling
Seeping into my brain
There's nothing to tell you
But it's never gonna be the same
Said that you can feel it
If you do like I do
Just don't let that ugly ego
Get the best of you

Can't turn back
You've got to leave that world behind
Don't you know
You know it's a fact now

Forget that ugly ego
Forget that ugly ego
Forget that ugly ego
Forget that ugly

Can't turn back
You've got to leave that world behind
Don't you know
You know it's a fact now

Do it!

Are you open
Are you open, tell me are you open
Are you open
Are you open, tell me are you open

Forget that ugly ego
Ugly ego
Forget that ugly ego
Ugly ego
