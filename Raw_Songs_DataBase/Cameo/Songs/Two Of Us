How many times have you looked outside
Sun shining bright
And you thought to yourself
Hey! Lovely lovely day

Well that happy day will be no more
Cause some of us are hungry and even more poor
You've got to get involved, get involved
The almighty is there to see, yeah

You've got company -
You've got to help one another
Cause we're all one
He's watching two of us by two of us
He's with us every day
With us in every way

How many times have you looked around
And found someone in need
Then you pushed them aside, pushed them aside
Considering yourself a fair person indeed

You see the news, it's no good news
The less fortunate people are still paying dues
Come on and stand up straight
The suffering won't wait
There's only one world for us to share
Yeah

He's with us every day in every way
He's watching two of us by two of us
He's watching two of us by two of us
He's watching two of us by two of us
He's watching two of us by two of us
He's watching two of us by two of us

He's watching, yeah
He's watching
He's watching
He's watching
