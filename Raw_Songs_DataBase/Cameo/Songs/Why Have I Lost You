Today I'm just a lonely man
But tomorrow I'll be a king
Blessing all my subjects
Cast afar and securities

The whole wide world will watch me
As I walk up to my throne
Nights in shining armor
Stand around to heed my call

But wait a minute
I'm still lonely
I guess anyone can dream
But when you lose someone it seems
So unimportant

Although every person changes
Different times and different ways
But never all the same

Tell me why (why)
Have I lost you (have I lost you baby)
Why (why)
Tell me ooohhhhhhh
