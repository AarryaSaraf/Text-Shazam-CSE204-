Album: Cameosis

// Why Have I Lost You //

Today I'm just a lonely man
But tomorrow I'll be a king
Blessing all my subjects
Cast afar and securities

The whole wide world will watch me
As I walk up to my throne
Nights in shining armor
Stand around to heed my call

But wait a minute
I'm still lonely
I guess anyone can dream
But when you lose someone it seems
So unimportant

Although every person changes
Different times and different ways
But never all the same

Tell me why (why)
Have I lost you (have I lost you baby)
Why (why)
Tell me ooohhhhhhh
[x2]

CAMEO-O-O-O-OSIS

When you hear a group that moves you
And you feel it in your feet
You ask yourself, hold on a minute
What group now can this be,

Get your body all excited
Cause if you listen you will know us, 
It's got to be that crazy sound of that good ole Cameosis

CAMEO-O-O-O-OSIS
Hay hay
CAMEO-O-O-O-OSIS

If when you feel it, then you'll know it
It won't be long, you will all be strong with

Dig the sound, dig the sound
Dig it with me...

You can't believe it, if you try, you will do it

CAMEO-O-O-O-OSIS
CAMEO-O-O-O-OSIS

If you try us then you like us, if you like us, then you'll see, Ha
We'll make the funky music better for you and for me
Always right for what is happenin and for dancing with a choice
But if you even can't get that much then tell me what's the point

CAMEO-O-O-O-OSIS
CAMEO-O-O-O-OSIS

If when you feel it, then you'll know it
It won't be long, you will, all be strong with

Dig the sound, dig the sound
Dig it with me...

You can't believe it, if you try, you will do it

Baby bubba baby

Baby bubba, bubba

// We're Goin' Out Tonight //

We're going out tonight
And I want my friends to know
'Cause you look just right
And my feelings start to show

I owe it all to you and I'm sure
I'll do the things you want me too

You shocked me, amazed me
You blew me away, hey
As I stand next to you, you make me nervous
I can't see a thing in front of me

For days and days
I can't forget you, no, no, no
My friends ask me why
My God, you've got me high

All the things I want
I find them hard to get
But now my luck has changed
And I knew that when we met

We're going out tonight
And we'll stand up in the crowd
'Cause we're dressed real nice
Even Gucci would be proud

I don't mind telling you
You look good
You look so good
So good to me

Your vibrations move me
Sentimentality grooves me
I hung up on this lovely girl

I've never seen us like this
Your teeth as white as pearls
Hey baby, you're the wonder of my world

When we step out tonight
The people will applaud
The girls will say, "My my"
And the guys will say, "Oh, Lord"

I'm in heaven, heaven
I'm in heaven
Heaven, heaven
Heaven's just for me

Heaven, heaven
I'm in heaven
Heaven, heaven
Heaven's just for me

I thank the Lord for what he's given me
Oh, it feels so nice to be
I'm in heaven
I'm in heaven, yeah

Ooh, oh, oh, oh, I'm in paradise
And you know if feels so nice
Yeah, I'll never let you go
And I want the world to know

Heaven, heaven
I'm in heaven
Heaven, heaven
Heaven's just for me

// I Care For You //

Where were you the night I called home?
It felt real strange when no one answered the phone
You told me, you'd never do me wrong, do me wrong
But you can't explain why you stayed out all night long

Was it something I said to you?
What did I do to make you wanna leave?
We tried our best, the very best our love could do
Darling, there's nothing left for me to do

I care, oh, I care for you
Darling, I care for you, oh, I love you

We told each other lies and we always tried
Appealing to the softness just to survive
I'm taking all I'm gonna take from you girl
This love affair is tearing me apart

Oh, you say over and over you're sorry
All the while you're just laughing
It's time for you to leave, yeah
This is not the way I wanted our love to be

Darling I care for you, you know I can't forget you girl no, no
You, you, darling I care for you, I care for you girl
Well you, I care, I can't, can't forget you, girl, no, no no

I really care, yeah, yeah, for you, girl
I think of all the times we spent together, girl
Oh, we had so much fun, yes

You don't know what you meant to me
And how you made me feel
Oh, the pain inside hurts so much girl

You see I wanna say, baby
Can I say, baby?
I love you, no I care
