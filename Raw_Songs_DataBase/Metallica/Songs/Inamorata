Welcome, won't you come inside
Meet the ghosts where I reside
Despite how they're abusing me
Lonely I will never be
Comfort in the hell I know
Resentment like a cancer grows
Longing for the day I'm free
Burn to get you out of me

Lying, supplying the need
Shedding and spreading the seed
Setting the trap with a thread
Spinning the web

Misery
She needs me
Oh, but I need her more

Misery
She loves me
Oh, but I love her more

Misery
She kills me
Oh, but I end this war

Misery
She fills me
Oh no, but she's not what I'm living for

Ricochets within my head
Conversations never said
Magnifying every thought
That familiar pain she brought
Seeps inside eventually
Misery loves company
Sullen, I created you
I suppose that I can end you too

She waits (She waits, she waits, she waits)

She waits (She waits, she waits, she waits)

Misery
She needs me
Oh, but I need her more

Misery
She loves me
Oh, but I love her more

Misery
She kills me
Ooh, but I end this war

Misery
She fills me
Oh no, but she's not what I'm living for
Oh no

Ooh, misery

She needs me
But I need her more
She loves me
But I love her more
She kills me (She kills me)
But I end this war
She fills me (She fills me)
But she's not what I'm living for

Oh no
Oh no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Not why I'm living

Misery
She needs me
Oh, but I need her more

Misery
She loves me
Oh, but I love her more

Misery
She kills me
Oh, but I end this war

Misery
She fills me
Oh no, but she's not what I'm living for

Misery
My misery

Misery
My misery

Misery
She's not why I'm living
My misery
She's not why I'm living
Misery
She's not what I'm living for
My misery
No, no
