Take a deep, waking breath
Hope the blood arrives
Burn my eyes with the sun
And pretend I'm alive
It never will appear
Strong as past desire
Light warming disappears
Like a cold, dead fire

Should I fall, I fall down
Would you come, you come 'round

Wake me
Caught in the spell I'm dreaming
Wake me
Day after day repeating
Wake me
Sleepwalk my life away

Stagger on through the fog
In the midnight sun
Shouting out at the shapes
Of the nameless no ones
All isn't what it seems
Cannot comprehend it
Captive inside a dream
Where the dawn won't end it

Should I fall, I fall down
Would you come, you come 'round

Wake me
Caught in the spell I'm dreaming
Wake me
Day after day repeating
Wake me
Sleepwalk my life away

Should I fall, I fall down
Would you come, you come 'round

Wake me
Caught in the spell I'm dreaming
Wake me
Day after day repeating
Wake me
Sleepwalk my life away
