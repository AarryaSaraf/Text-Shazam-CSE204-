So tight this crown of barbed wire
Its destiny I wear
It splits the skin to the soul
This jagged wreath I bear

This rusted empire I own
Bleed as I rust on this throne
Pierce
Me
With torment
And all the rust that I own

So tight
This crown of barbed wire
So tight
This crown of barbed wire
So tight, this crown

Fist tight, it stains conviction
Drips down to bloodshot eyes
It crushes down what is real
Deep crimson blots the skies

This rusted empire I own
Bleed as I rust on this throne
Pierce
Me
With torment
And all the rust that I own

So tight
This crown of barbed wire
So tight
This crown of barbed wire
So tight, this crown

This rusted empire I own
Bleed as I rust on this throne
Pierce
Me
With torment
And all the rust that I own

So tight
This crown of barbed wire
So tight
This crown of barbed wire
So tight this crown
