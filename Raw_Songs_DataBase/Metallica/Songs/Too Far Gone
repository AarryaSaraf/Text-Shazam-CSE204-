I, I am desperation
Need it so bad today
I, I am isolation
Static and disarray
Need this, gotta have more
Crawling out my skin
Sickness, scarring returns
Burning me again

Too far gone
Am I too far gone
Am I too far gone to save?
Help me make it through the day
No

I, I am tribulation
Digging down to the bone
I, I am agitation
Never leaves me alone
Keep on, push it along
Don't want to feel this
Sink in, start to believe
That I don't exist

Too far gone
Am I too far gone
Am I too far gone to save?
Help me make it through the day
Oh

All away
I am desperation
All away
I am isolation
All away
I am agitation
All away

Too far gone
Never too far gone
I'm never too far gone to save
I can make it through the day

Make it through the day

Just for today
