There's no light

Down and out as darkness falls
So much more than he can take
Shakes the cage in deep withdrawals
Come on, give the boy a break

Oh, he will break
He's no mistake

Chase that light, lean on me
Face that fight, lean on me
Catch your fall, lean on me
End it all, lean on me
Struggle on, 'cause without darkness
Without darkness, there's no light

Lost his way through wicked streets
But he is someone's little boy
All the love a young one needs
Thoughtless elders have destroyed

It is destroyed
He's just a boy

Chase that light, lean on me
Face that fight, lean on me
Catch your fall, lean on me
End it all, lean on me
Struggle on, 'cause without darkness
Without darkness, there's no light

One step down
Block it all from view
One step down
With apathy, look straight through
One step down
Turn so you won't see
One step down
He's just like you and me

Chase that light, lean on me
Face that fight, lean on me
Catch your fall, lean on me
End it all, lean on me
Struggle on, 'cause without darkness
Without darkness, there's no light

There's no light
