Catch a fire and burn all the misery
Foul fingers spin mob mentality
Anger on the rise as the flames grow higher
Choke on the smoke of the funeral pyre
Backfire

Killing all we've learned
History will burn
Burn it

Smile as it burns to the ground
The perfect don't want you around
Question yourself, you may learn
Who's the next witch you must burn?
You must burn!

In the name of hell, henchmen to conspire
Black figures loom as a dark desire
Inquisition served, build your enemy
Tied to the stake, torching heresy
Flame out

Killing all we've learned
History will burn
Burn it

Smile as it burns to the ground
The perfect don't want you around
Question yourself, you may learn
You are the witch you must burn
You must burn!

In the heat of the night
In the moon's shining light
Feed the appetite
In the heat of the night
In the moon's shining light
Feed the appetite

Smile as it burns to the ground
The perfect don't want you around
Question yourself, you may learn
You are the witch you must burn
You must burn!

You must burn!
You must burn!
You must burn!
