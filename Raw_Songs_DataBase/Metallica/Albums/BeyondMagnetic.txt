// Hate Train //

Hate is a train
That thunders aimless through my head
And hate is the fame
Chained to the wheel until I am dead
Rage is a flame
Creates a touch to boil the seas
And rage is to blame
Forever sorry I shall be
And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge

No
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
Straight down into the sorrow, but still I stand

Wrath is the name
Branding suffer onto you
And wrath takes the shame 
And holds me down until it is through
And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge

You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I sink into the sorrow, still I stand

And hate is a train
That hungers for the flesh's call
And hate takes the blame
A beast that never slows at all
And from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
Burst into flame, the bitter end
And shake the gates of hell again

Yeah, cursed to drown in sorrow

You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
You left me here with sorrow, still I stand

Oh, still I stand

// Just A Bullet Away //

All roads they lead to shame
All drowning in the blame
All reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver

All hide beneath a skin
A hope so paper thin
I'm at the door again
And the shine of the midnight revolver

Even the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a 45

Suck on the barrel
Suck on the barrel
Suck it 'til it's gone dry

For all reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver

Redemption purify
Will nothing satisfy
The scars just multiply
In the shine of the midnight revolver

Twisting in apocalypse
Death upon the fingertips
Frigid metal touches lips
And the shine of the midnight revolver

'Cause you lied

Just a bullet away
Just a bullet away from leavin' you
Just a bullet away
Stop the voices in my head

Caressing death again
Becomes the heroin
Forbidden medicine
Puts a shine on the midnight revolver

Eternal borderline
All the faces intertwine
Oh God... now I see mine
In the shine of the midnight revolver

Even the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a 45

Suck on the barrel
Suck on the barrel
Suck... suck till it's dry

For all reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver

Down In Misery
Down In Misery

Just a bullet away
Just a bullet away from leavin' you
Just a bullet away
Stop the voices in my head

All roads they lead to shame
All drowning in the blame
Reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver

All hide beneath a skin
A hope so paper thin
I'm at the door again
And the shine of the midnight revolver

Even the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a 45

Suck on the barrel
Suck on the barrel
Suck... suck till it's dry

Do all reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver

'Cause you lied
Yes you lied

Just a bullet away
Just a bullet away from leavin' you
Just a bullet away
Stop the voices in my head

// Hell And Back //

There is nowhere else I can run to 
She is wretched but she comforts me
After everyone goes home
She's always there for me
And when the sun goes hellbound
And the moon does resurrect the night
I'll hide within her
Not much good has come out the light

After everyone goes home
And I'm left here on my own
I will run straight to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
When they turn out all their lights
And I'm left to brood at night
Always return to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
Straight down

A lonely light in a window
Just longing for some company
Tragic, heartless and hateful
But there's nothing as willing as she
And when the night has fallen
It falls hard and then it all begins
When she starts her calling
I feel my darkness growing from within

I become two
We become one
Unbridled... unequaled... unholy... undone
The path is cut deep
The path is worn well
I'll follow my footsteps to the warmth of Hell
The warmth of Hell

// Rebel Of Babylon //

Rebel grip your bottle tight
Just float away
Rebel is it hard to leave
What makes you stay?
Go take your poison ink
Sign life away
Then take your dirty spoon
And dig your grave

Rebel grips the bottle tight
Just floats away
Rebel finds it hard to leave
What makes you stay?
He takes the poison ink
Signing life away
Then takes the dirty spoon
And digs his grave

Let this dark shine
Let this dark shine
Let it shine bright
Don't let it burn out tonight
Kill me one more time
Stigmata
Kill me one more time
Neo martyr
Gonna die young
Gonna live forever
Kill me one more time
Rise up
Rebel of Babylon
Rise up
Rise up
Resurrection

Renegade fights the fight
That no one wins
He claims a crown of thorns
To pierce the skin
He climbs his crucifix
And waits for dawn
Thinks they'll remember him
After he's gone

The rebel fights the fight
That no one wins
To claim a crown of thorns
To pierce his skin
Climbs his crucifix
And waits for dawn
He loses consciousness
The myth lives on
