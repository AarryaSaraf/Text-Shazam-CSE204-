// Airbound //

Feel the poppin' in your ears
In the air when you're flying
And you finally get the feeling
This is where you belong
There is nothin' on this earth
That can take you higher
And you finally get to see
You're soaring out on your own

Airbound
Oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh my
Airbound

You probably never thought yourself
As being much of a pilot
There's a million buttons
Easy over at the controls
Yawnin' in the cockpit
Time for take-off
Racin' rocket motors
And you're 'bout to explode

Airbound
Oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh my
Airbound

Feel the poppin' in your ears
In the air when you're flying
And you finally get the feeling
This is where you belong
There is nothin' on this earth
That can take you higher
And you finally get to see
You're soaring out on your own
We gone, we gone, we gone, we gone, we gone
Never to ever come down...

You probably never thought yourself
As being much of a pilot
There's a million easy
Buttons over at the controls
Yawnin' in the cockpit
Time for take-off
Racing rocket motors
And you're about to explode

Airbound
Oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh my
Airbound

Feel the poppin' in your ears
In the air when you're flying
And you finally get the feeling
This is where you belong
There is nothin' on this earth
That can take you higher
And you finally get to see
You're soaring out on your own
We gone, we gone, we gone, we gone, we gone
Never to ever come down...

// Tweakin' //

Three-way, six-detachable
Speaker system

Hi diddle-diddle
This cat on the fiddle
Was killin' 'em
Recorded him on my tapedeck
Hi diddle-diddle
This cat on the fiddle
Was killin' 'em
Recorded him on my tapedeck

Just when I reach the point
Where I was peakin'
'Bout that time
Imagination start to peepin'
That's when my other voices
Start to speakin'
Speakin' in drum
Drummin' it into a tweak
Voice so loud
Pinnin' the needle
Bangin' in the red
Noone hears
Nothing's heard cause nothing's said
It's the chokin' kind
Remember the livin'
Remember the dead
Speakin' in drum
Drummin' it into a tweak

Drowning out the voices
In my head
Follow follow?
(Do you)
Follow follow?

Shot rang out everybody ran for cover
The evening news broke the story of two mothers
One's son is dead
Killed by the son of the other
Escalatin' the violence to a peak
Tweak
Hi diddle-diddle
This cat on the fiddle
Was killin' 'em
Recorded him on my tapedeck
To the curb...

Three-way, six detachable
Speaker systems
With soft ejection
Tweak
Auxiliary output
Extra input
So you can plug into
And make connections

Caught in a land
That pitted the poor man
Against the police
When it's hard to live
It's twice as hard
To keep the peace
It's the chokin' kind
Remember the livin'
Remember the dead
Poor is the poor man
So is the police

Violence of a tweak

Cue me about
A cool place to start

Attention all radio-stations jocks
I got the beat
Serious-slammin' on my box
So what I try
My best to do
Is keep the decibels
Up so high
My neighbors call the cops

Now when the thang
Get to tweakin'
You know the groove is peakin'
I mean hard

OK now I know

You know what I mean
I keep a party
On my record machine
Do me a favor
Don't let so many commercials
Disrupt the playlist
Mr. E. Tiddyock
Is what makes me say this
About groove control
Well there's no such thang
When I turn on my box
I'm ready to swing
So I can go
Down, down
Get down with it
I be throwin' down
But you gotta be down
To get it
We tweakin' on my radio
Serious-slammin' on my box
Get off my jock!

I take your buns
And turn 'em into the B's
I take your soul
And turn it into some cheese
I'll take your radio
And turn it into stereo
Now we livin' large boy
Break out the Casio
So we can get busy
Show me that you ain't dizzy
Only Lizzie is fizzy

I'm in my Flavor-mobile
I'm cold-lampin'
I this G upstate
Cold campin'
To the Poconos
We call the Hideaways
With a bag of franks
And a big bag of Frito-Lays
Hey yo, Chuck!
They don't know
What I'm sayin'
You know what I'm sayin'?

Word up man
And if y'all don't know
What I'm sayin'
Then act like
You wanna be stayin'
But we ain't playin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, Chuck, man
Kick some
Kick some ballistics, man

What's your beeper
Tellin' you man?
My beeper's tellin' me
They sweatin' me home
They sweatin' me, man

Yo, there's many ways
To kick it round
We gon' kick it
The same 'round once again
You know what I'm sayin'
But this time in time
Aw right, c'mon let's go

You know what I'm sayin'?
We ain't playin'
The P-Funk of the drummer
On the beat box
The band supporter
Go get a quarter
Somethin' y'all
That spills like water
Can't lower the volume
Dare to consume
The rhythm y'all
Comin' through the speaker y'all
Network
Net-a-work-a
Work-connect
Cold slammin' like the New York Mets
Know what I'm sayin'?
They don't know what I'm sayin'
They don't know what we're screamin', shoutin'
Yo Flavor
Do you know what I just said?
Do the people know what I'm talkin' about?

I know what you said
But let me tell you
George Clinton's got the head
You know what I'm sayin'?
Let me tell you somethin', yo!
George will tell ya
Hold my jam-e while I go P
You understand what I'm sayin'?

Cause that's the way it be
Cause his name is George
And his last name begins with a C
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Follow, follow
Hey, yo, Butch man
What's up pop?
Hey, yo, Tracy
With the Panasonic
What's up man?
Yo man
We gonna rock that
Why B-side 'round man
You wanna rock the B-side

Food for the brain
Beat for the feet
People on the dance floor
Never claiming a receipt
Had a good time
Rock-n-rollin'
On the go behind
The rhythm supplied
By the superior B-side
They had the twist
That turn and shout
Turn the jam out
Get you ready now
C'mon
The situation put you in to where you sweatin'
An hysterical B-side
C'mon inside
Request the best
They give a test
And never gave a rest

Your guess as good
As my guess
And while you're guessin'
You're guessin'
Yo listen
This a DJ to play
To give a lesson in
His name is
George Clinton
In the house

// The Cinderella Theory //

You went skinny dippin'
You left your wet suit drippin'
On a tree
You were exoteric
It was so esoteric
It just had to be

We spoke of love through our eyes
Attracted, drawn or magnetized
You smiled at me
I turned my head to see
Still on the tree
It occurred to me
She had nothing on

Oh I, oh no, oh no

Cinderella Theory
Try these on see if they fit
It's the Cinderella Theory
Try these on see if they fit
If they fit it was you
I've been lookin' for

Oh I, oh no, oh no

Enthusiastically, desperately and eagerly
I searched for you
I'll be the FBI, the CIA
I'll even be a bloodhound, too
Sniff, sniff, sniffin'

Cinderella Theory
Try these on see if they fit
It's the Cinderella Theory
Try these on see if they fit
If they fit it was you
I've been lookin' for

// Why Should I Dog U Out? //

Fresh for '98...
Suckers

I've been duped and slimed before
I've been walked on like I was a floor
Bent out of shape
Is the shape that I'm in
I'm always glad to see the face of a good friend

Sticks and stones may break my bones
I can grow or I can pass it on
It's so hard to leave it alone
I'm always glad to see the face of a good friend

Why should I dog u out?

Goofy
Dog u out
Snoopy
Dog u out
Spud
Dog
Marmaduke
Dog u out
Why should I dog u out?

Get a little funk
Then you sell out
Shake a few rumps
Then you sold out
We did all of that
Without selling out

Get a little funk
Then you sell out
Shake a few rumps
Then you sold out
We did all of that
Without chillin' out

How much is that doggie in the window
The one with the waggly tail
How much is that doggie in the window
I do hope that doggie's for sale

I'm a blind dog with a seeing eye man
If I mistake you for a fire hydrant I hope you understand

Get a little funk
Then you sell out
Shake a few rumps
Then you sold out
We did all of that
Without selling out

// There I Go Again //

Love boat is sailing
You'll be dockin' tonight
Bringin' me love and then
You'll sail out of sight

There I go again
Break my heart again
And I'm goin' for it every time
For sure again
It shows again
And it's goin' in and out of my mind
Even if you're blind
You will see you're on my mind
There I go again
It shows again
And I'm goin' for it every time
There I go again
Break my heart again
And I'm goin' for it every line
For sure again
It shows again
And it's goin' in and out of my mind
Even if you're blind
You will see you're on my mind
It shows for sure again
And I'm goin' for it every time

Love boat is sailin'
You'll be dockin' tonight
Bringin' me love and then
You'll steal out of sight

There I go again
Break my heart again
But I'm comin' back to you
'Cause I know again
Once more again
That I've done the best that I can do
Even if you're blind
You will see you're on my mind
There I go again
Break my heart again
And I'm comin' back to you

Love boat is sailing
You'll be dockin' tonight
Bringin' me love and then
You'll steal out of sight

Even if you're blind
You will see you're on my mind

Even if you're blind
You will see you're on my mind

Love boat is sailing
You'll be dockin' tonight...

// (She Got It) Goin' On //

She wore a Fila mentality
Sporting a beeper
On her hips
Good to go Kangol
With some tight mobile jeans
Ooh, I mean
Totally good and fresh
Totally serious

She got it goin' on
She got it goin' on
She got it goin' on
She got it goin' on

A-plus student
Soon to be
A college grad
Two jobs
Hang out all night long
Tell me
Ain't the girl bad?
She got it goin' on
She got it goin' on
The girl's
Got it goin' on
She got it goin' on

Something about
Some student unrest
In solidarity
With the Third World
You know the girl
Raised a fist
She said
Economical terrorism
Was at the bottom
Of it all
And at the top
Was a fat cat
And Humpty Dumpty
Is about to fall

Real weird hairstyles
Curls of Jheri

Politically
The girl's head is scary
Activist
Active fist
Activator
Active later

Whether lust or whether it's a burnin' need

// Rita Bewitched //

She tried to call us
On the telephone
Rita's bewitched, it's true
'Cause when I answered
She told me she was on her way over
And it wouldn't take long
My dear Rita babe
By the fence I duck and hide
Wasting my time around
Girl you oughta stay home
My car sittin' right out back

I was supposed to be gone
I was supposed to be gone

She done come cut 'em on
Uponst her broomstick riding low
Next time you catch me on a Thursday
When I'm not at home with friends
Who don't want to meet you
My dear Rita babe
'Cause girl when I'm with you
I cry out loud, scream stark raving mad
Baby ooh yeah, ooh yeah
What I want to say
Is never quite take for granted
That I might be afraid
Abracadabra my foot

Well, is gonna be good?
Well, is gonna be good?

I'm not afraid of your flame
But don't let it burn my thang
Uponst her broomstick ridin' low
Rita is bewitched
Look out, Rita's bewitched
She get down make me itch
She got me marching
Rita don't wanna be alone
She's got me dreaming
She's gonna be receiving my body
Right down to the bone
Wee Gee board cannot express
What I find in each breath
She blows down my back
Or in her heart she gives when
I know she won't take it back
Abracadabras, hocus-pocus, alakazam
So frightful, seems unreal
She knows she got hex appeal
What I wanna say
Is never quite taken for granted
That I might be afraid
Rita's bewitched look out
Rita's bewitched
Rita

She's got me burnin'
She's got me burnin'

One hundred and ninety degrees
Go tell your mama
Before it's too late
Rita's gonna burn the mother down
Crystal ball, cannot recall
Past events and time we spent
On her basement floor
Or in a '57 Chevy
Down by the seashore
Rita is bewitched
Look out...
Rita is bewitched
Look out
That old Black Magic
Got me in her spell
Nothin' but a witch
Give me an itch
