// Summer Swim //

It's 12 o'clock, do you know where your baby is
Someone outta chalk the mind that freed me up to mine
But booties have the right away
The light of day
Plays on your imagination
On the beach suited and booty flossing bathing suits
Tube checking, it's not as simple as a TAPOAFOM
It's a strange thing
Booty see booty do
Yeah
Slow walking packing with nothing lacking
Ooh baby, you got all that won't do nothing mad of you

Can you drown sink or swim sue
Can you drown sink or swim sue
On the beach, and she's looking cute
On the beach, and you're looking cute
Where the booty's have the right away
Although I might be hot
All the girls just be playin' that cool
To the max
You can see them in the light of day
Where the booties have the right way
And you have to sneak a peak
Cause booty beautiful obstructing your view
Wow, maximum booties

Fish better be glad you don't use booty for a bait
There is no more balling and stalling we don't hesitate
Plenty many kitties on maxy booty
You can see them in the light of day
Maximum looters do yo your duty
Booty see booty do let's all
Take a summer swim
Take a summer swim
Will you come and wade in the water with me

What you see is what you would like to get
By the pool booty's flossing you can bet
And the girls don't be lacking
Cos' the fellas they be packing it too
Man, the girls ain't lacking the fellas maybe packing too
For all we know is booty's show and tell
And believe us the booty shows so well
How d'you get all you got into what you in and wearing on you

Fish better be glad you don't use booty for a bait
There is no more balling and stalling we don't hesitate
Plenty many kitties on maxy booty
Maximum looters do your duty
Booty see booty do let's all
Take a summer swim

Will you come and wade in the water with me
In the water lap me girl, ooh let's all

Do the backstroke, do the backstroke
Doggy paddle, ooh

Summer swim...

Fish better be glad you don't use booty for a bait
There is no more balling and stalling we don't hesitate
Plenty many kitties on maxy booty
You can see them in the light of day

// Funky Kind (Gonna Knock It Down) //

You've taught yourself to dance to the beat and swing and jive
But the entertainers didn't like the way you move
You'd have never pledged to yourself that you'd become a dancer
By checking your steps you've found how to rock the groove

It's the close encounter of the funky kind
Close encounter of the funky kind
The funky kind, the funky kind
In the Hall of Fame she generated such a beautiful scene
She gone made me too
Ooh-aah-ooh-tchaa-tchaa
Ooh-aah-ooh

She's got the look like a funky singer of Motown
She's gonna knock it down
Coming out of the blue, and I tear all that shit up
I'm here to get down
Her lipstick stained my long nose slacks
She said I love you and smacked me
My mind was gettin' cracked
And I'm gonna knock it down

I'm gonna knock it down and tear it up
I'm gonna knock it down and tear it up
And when I get with it
I know you know just what I mean
I'm gonna knock it down and tear it up
I'm gonna knock it down and tear all that shit up
And when I do it
I'll be sticking to it like hot grits on Al Green
(The close encounter of the funky kind)

I'm gonna knock it down and tear it up
I'm gonna knock it down and tear it up
And when I get with it
I know you know just what I mean
I'm gonna knock it down and tear it up
I'm gonna knock it down and tear all that shit up
And when I do it
I'll be sticking to it like hot grits on Al Green

Heavy Metal, Hip Hop
Gangsta Rap oversamples of Doo Wop
Funkin' with rock chops, rockin' with funk chops
Only the weasel goes pop
(It's the close encounter of Starchild)
Only the weasel goes pop, only the weasel
Only the weasel goes pop
In the Hall of Fame she generated such a beautiful scene

Every night, after night
The Supremes send me crazy
As all Motown artists break my heart
Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye and Diana Ross
The Temptations, Otis Redding and Sam Cooke
Elvis, I do love you so too
You're gonna stay in my mind forever
Another component for T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M
To pick up of course, y'all
Gonna give up the funk, tear the roof the roof the sucker
Psychoalphadiscobetabioaquadooloop
And we're gonna turn this mutha out
Unfunky kind of UFO, Motor Booty Affair
Your funk is the best Dr. Funkenstein
The Mothership Connection is here, therefore
Get up for the down stroke

Tonight, every night, after night
The Supremes send me crazy
As all Motown artists break my heart
Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross
The Temptations, Otis Redding and Sam Cooke
Elvis, I do love you so too
You're gonna stay in my mind forever
(The close encounter of the funky kind)
Let them know

Tear it up, I'm gonna knock it down and tear it up
And when I get with it
I know you know just what I mean
Gonna knock it down and tear it up
Gonna knock it down and tear all that shit up
And when I do it
I'll be sticking to it like hot grits on Al Green

She's got the look like a funky singer of Motown
She's gonna knock it down
Coming out of the blue, and I tear all that shit up
I'm here to get down
Her lipstick stained my long nose slacks
She said I love you and smacked me
My mind was gettin' cracked
And I'm gonna knock it down
I'm gonna knock it down and tear it up
I'm gonna knock it down and tear it up

// Mathematics //

I've counted any evidence of love
In mind mathematically
I'm not too gladed about the kisses
I suppose you give, baby you made me insane
Tell me why don't you pay attention to my love?
I do adore you so
I keep on trying to focus your interest on me
As you can see, I miss and love you

Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest
Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest

I've taken the stick in the backbone, everytime
But I know how to resist you
Even if it's better to say I would like

Say oh my baby, y'all
I've been givin' you too many chances, baby
To me you were baby the only one, because

Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest
Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest

I've counted how many times
I've been tryin' to give my evidence to you, mathematically
And all the infringements of interest
Supposedly I've been missin'
My validation wouldn't mean to pay attention
I'm tryin' to focus your interest on me
I've been missin' you

Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest

I've taken the stick in the backbone, everytime
But I know how to resist you
Even if it's better to say I would like
My love for you has been comin' into you too fast
And I've been givin' you too many chances, mathematically

Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest
Any percent of you

Infractions of love mean

Any percent of you

Infractions of love mean

Any evidence I've been givin' you
I've counted in my mind like a mathematics
Any infractions of interest
Make me naughty and evil
But I do love you baby, baby

Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Any evidence I've been givin' you
I've counted in my mind mathematically
I need your love, baby

// Hard As Steel //

You can't silly putty mold her in the pot
Or play her like play dough
Cuz' she gon' say no
She like it hard
Hard as a rock
Hard as steel and still gettin' harder
Hard as steel and still gettin' harder
Her shit's got a heavy metal hard-on
Pussy posse pumped
To get its throb on
Eardrum bashin' sounds
Come crashin' down
From the dance band
On the band stand
To the dance floor
Encore

Hard up for more
Hard as steel and still gettin' harder
Hard as steel and still gettin' harder
And when she's thru
Off with the dude
She gave the backstage to
No itsy bitsy pee wee penis type
Of pecker poker pusher
Ever penetrating the pussy
She like 'em hung, young
A yard of tongue
Always givin' a five
For a job well done

You can't silly putty mold her in the pot
Or play her like play dough
Cuz' she gon' say no
She like it hard
Hard as a rock
Hard as steel and still gettin' harder
Hard as steel and still gettin' harder
Rock
We rockin' up a rockstar shit
You can't miss her with the faking the funk
Kind of popstar shit
She ain't wit' it

You can't silly putty mold me in the pot
Or play me like play dough
Cuz' I'm gon' say no
I like it hard
Hard as a rock
Hard as steel and still gettin' harder
Rockin' you between a funk and a hard
Place in between the place you are
And the place you wish to be placed
Funk 'em just to see the look on their face
Left to right face
About face, and etcetera!

Hump, bump, chump with a pump
That's hard to keep up with
Rock hard
If it ain't as hard as its gonna get shit
Put your hard-on the rock
Let me see what you got
If it's something hard
A few inches to a yard
Hard as steel and still gettin' harder
Hard as steel and still gettin' harder

// New Spaceship //

As I prepare myself to play live
As I rehearse the songs that I've recorded
I've been finding a new spaceship
Everybody in the place
Will you stand by me on the new spaceship?

A new spaceship has landed, now
A new spaceship has landed
A new spaceship has landed
From the dawn lights to the dark

A new spaceship baby, how I feel about you
How I feel alright, you're my delight
I feel freaky and so distorted
I've got my freakin' heart broken, now
And I will go to the corner about you
My pain for the freak of you
I've freaked out for the freak of you
Tweaked out for your tweaking
Speaked out before I speak to you
(Tweaked out)
(Speaked out before I speak to you)

Make it last or you'll make me out of this world
Think about when you guaranteed that we'd have good time

What's goin' on seems to me
I've never ever used to be
Probably I've let things go freeze

A new spaceship is here
A new spaceship is here

Like plantations grown in this world since it began
What can't be wrong, baby?
So welcome aboard, baby
Let's sit down across the new spaceship
Let's travel now the whole planetary system
Above the Earth
Time now is tweakin'
Time now goes freakin'
Freakin' out for the freak of you

// Underground Angel //

Standing on the earth's stratosphere
That's what I really do
When I stay aboard the mothership
When I head up high to the sky
Then I dedicate you a song, and you get it

There's a girl uptight that you don't like the funk
And you don't like to boogie with her
Nobody knows how to solve the problem
There's a party in the neighborhood
I think about that maybe they get funky
The mothership was gettin' ready for the next trip
But I've moved here to the party to the save the funk
'Cause I'm an angel landed to the underground

Baby, pretty little angel
Come here to rescue me and take me underground

Hey what's your name, man?
My name is knee deep, tales of kidd funkadelic
America eats its young
Cosmic slop, hardcore jollies
Maggot brain, one nation under a groove
Check out my shit, haven't you had enough of it?
The electric spanking of war babies
Uncle jam wants you
Standing on the verge of gettin' it on
Do you want a little more?
Let's take it to the stage

Baby, pretty little angel
Come here to rescue me and take me underground
Baby, pretty little angel
Come here to rescue me and take me underground

I love your funk, I do like it
I want the funk playing like a G.I. Joe
I've got to boogie all day
So what would you like to do, so let me know
The neighborhood party broke the ground
So what would you like to do, so let me know
And caused ground vibrations all around
And crashed the house roofs like dinosaurs on glass
So like I've said before

Baby, pretty little angel
Come here to rescue me and take me underground
Baby, pretty little angel
Come here to rescue me and take me underground

I do like the funk, I do like it
I want the funk playing like a G.I. Joe
I've got to boogie all day
There's a party in the neighborhood, it will last until night
It makes me feel like dancin' all day
The neighborhood party will break the ground
And cause ground vibrations all around
And crash the house roofs like dinosaur on glass
So like I've already said before

Baby, pretty little angel
Come here to rescue me and take me underground
Baby, pretty little angel
Come here to rescue me and take me underground
Baby, pretty little angel
Come here to rescue me and take me underground
Baby, pretty little angel
Come here to rescue me and take me underground

// Let's Get Funky //

// Sloppy Seconds //

Sloppy seconds make me wake up from my first impression
Sloppy seconds make time movin'
Sloppy seconds are tickin' and tockin' then go stand in line
Ticking in my head

Sloppy seconds make me wake up from my first impress
Sloppy seconds make me ride on the mothership
Sloppy seconds make the hourglass runs of out sand
If you have to ask what time is it

Sloppy seconds make me the clockwork swingle
Sloppy seconds make me wonder if there's a clock yet
Sloppy seconds make me know what time is currently
Sloppy seconds make the time ticking in my head

Sloppy seconds make me wake up from my very first impress
And make me ask what time is currently
Sloppy seconds make me wake up from my very first impress
And make me ask what time is currently

A time long gone I've been ridin' on the mothership
Sloppy seconds make the time movin' on too
I gave up the funk aboard the mothership
Time long gone I've been ridin' on the mothership
I gave up the funk aboard the mothership
Time long gone I've been ridin' on the mothership

Da-da-da-da-da...

Sloppy seconds make me wake up from my first impress
Sloppy seconds make me ridin' on the mothership
Sloppy seconds make me wake up from my first impress
Sloppy seconds make me ridin' on the mothership

// Rock The Party //

Sometimes this world
Has got me thinkin' about I'm losing my mind
Forever searching for love
One day a solid relationship I just will find
I will take away the negativity
With a little Funk and love we got the perfect melody
The queen will come and the prince will go
Consequently how when it's cold you get a little snow

Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?

The only sin of love that I've committed has been justified
Girl, all I want to do is show everywhere my love for you
Sometimes you're just hurtin' me
So stop and see what's goin' on
Before to this world high heaven blues eternally I will go
There's no word that can express how I feel about you
So why don't you relax your mind
While I just give away the Funk

Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Tell me, you've got to tell me

You've got to tell me will you rock the party
Until the break of dawn
Will you rock the funky party?
You'll fell the rhythm to make you move your body
Will you rock the funky party?
You'll feel the rhythm to make you move your body
Baby, we're gonna jammin' and rockin' and stompin'
Until the break of dawn (yeah, yeah)

Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Baby, let me tell you
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
