// Ain't That Peculiar //

Ain't that peculiar baby?
Ain't that peculiar baby?
Ain't that peculiar?

You, you, you, you, you
You do me wrong but I'm still crazy 'bout you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love grow stronger than before

I know flowers grow from rain
But how can love grow from pain baby?
Now ain't that peculiar? Peculiar as can be
(Ain't that peculiar? Ain't that peculiar?)
Ain't that peculiar baby? Peculiarity
(Ain't that peculiar? Ain't that peculiar?)

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
But I'm so much in love with you baby that I don't wanna see
That the things you do and say are designed to make me blue
Doggone shame my love for you makes all your lies seem true

If truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make mine stronger, oh baby?
Ain't that peculiar? Peculiarity
(Ain't that peculiar, peculiar?)
Ain't that peculiar? Peculiar as can be
(Ain't that peculiar?)

Ain't it peculiar baby? Peculiar as can be
(Ain't that peculiar? Ain't that peculiar?)
Ain't that peculiar?
Ain't that peculiar? Peculiarity

I know love can last through years
But how can my love laugh through tears?
I know love can last through years
But how can love laugh through tears?

Ain't it peculiar baby?
(Ain't that peculiar? Ain't that peculiar?)

Ain't that peculiar? Ain't that peculiar?
Ain't that peculiar? That's all I can do baby

Ain't that peculiar? Ain't that peculiar?
Ain't that peculiar? Ain't that peculiar?
Ain't that peculiar? Ain't that peculiar?
Ain't that peculiar?

// Mathematics Of Love //

I count the moments we're apart and add them up mathematically
And multiply them by the kisses supposedly I've been missing
Divided by the attention not to mention the affection
Subtract that from your gross potential
And see I ain't missin' none

Cause any percentage of you is as good the whole pie
An infraction thereof brings dividends of interest
Any percentage of you is as good as the whole pie
An infraction there of brings dividends of love

I take the square root and get boxed in every time
When I know the shortest distance between two points
Is it a straight line?
I gotta come in to you more, in to you two times
And get rid of one, over to where we equal one
Equal one

Cause any percentage of you is as good the whole pie
An infraction thereof brings dividends of interest
Any percentage of you is as good as the whole pie
An infraction there of brings dividends of love

// Let The Good Times Roll //

Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let me thrill your soul
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Roll all night long

Come on, baby, and a listen to this
This is a something you just can't miss
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Roll all night long

Come on, baby, while the thrill is on
Come on, baby, rock me all night long
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Roll all night long

Come on, baby, just a close the door
Come on, baby, lets a rock some more
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Roll all night long

Feels so good when you're home
Come on, baby, rock me all night long

Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let me thrill your soul
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Roll all night long

Feels so good when you're home
Come on, baby, rock me all night long

Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let me thrill your soul
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Roll all night long

Come on, baby, let the good times roll...

// Gypsy Woman //

From nowhere through a caravan
Around the campfire light
A lovely woman in motion
With hair as dark as night

Her eyes like a cat in the dark
They hypnotize me with love

She was a gypsy woman, a gypsy woman
She was a gypsy woman, a gypsy woman

She danced around and around
To a guitar melody
Her face was all aglow
How she enchanted me

And oh, I'd like to hold her near
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

I love you gypsy woman, gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman, gypsy woman

Yeah, gypsy woman, love you gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman

All through the caravan
She was dancing with all the men
Waiting for the rising sun
Everyone was having fun

I hate to see the lady go
Knowing that she'll never know
I love her
Said, I love her

She was my gypsy woman, gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman, yeah, gypsy woman

Love you gypsy woman, I love you gypsy woman
I love you gypsy, gypsy, gypsy woman
Gypsy woman, woman, I love you gypsy woman

// It's All In The Game //

Many a tear has to fall
But it's all in the game
All in the wonderful game
That we know as love

You have words with him
And your future's looking dim
But these things your heart can rise
Heart can rise above (oh yeah)

Once in a while he won't call
But it's all in the game
Soon he'll be there at your side
With a sweet bouquet (with a sweet bouquet)

Then he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away

Then he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away
...

// Heart Trouble //

Worry angel's got a hold on me
I can't think for myself
I'm turnin' gray from being blue
You've found someone else

This strangest thing is buggin' me
Without your face around
You've found another to do your lovin'
Me you have put down

And I'm sittin' here with a broken heart
Wishin' you'd come home
Sittin' here with achin' arms
I just can't go on

Heart trouble
My life just ain't worthwhile
Without your love
I can't even force a smile

I'm trudging water all through the house
I thought was from a leakin' sink
I phoned the plumber to rush right over
See if he could fix the leak

He rushed right in and he took a look
Much to my surprise
He said, my son it's not your sink
It's teardrops from your eye

And I'm sittin' here with a broken heart
Wishin' you'd come home
Sittin' here with achin' arms
I just can't go on

Heart trouble
My life just ain't worthwhile
Without your love
I can't even force a smile

Heart trouble
You know that my life just ain't worthwhile
Without your love
Can't even force a smile

I chew my nails off one by one
Only got one to go
And until I see your face again
Nails I have no more

My nerves are shot, I smoke a lot
In this loneliness
And until I see your face again
My poor heart won't rest

And I'm sittin' here with a broken heart
Wishin' you'd come home
Sittin' here with achin' arms
I just can't go on

Heart trouble
My life just ain't worthwhile
Without your love
I can't even force a smile

Heart trouble
My life just ain't worthwhile
Without your love
You know I can't even force a smile

My nerves are shot, I smoke a lot
In this loneliness
And until I see your face again
The lonely heart won't rest

Heart trouble
Without your love

// Our Day Will Come //

Our day will come and we'll have everything
We'll share the joy falling in love would bring
No one can tell me that I'm too young to know
I love you so and you love me

Our day will come if we just wait a while
No tears for us, think love and wear a smile
Our dreams have magic because
We'll always stay in love this way
Our day will come

No one can tell me that I'm too young to know
I love you so and you love me

Our dream have magic because
We'll always stay in love this way
Our day...

// A Thousand Miles Away //

You're a thousand miles away
But I still have your love to remember you by
Oh, my darling dry your eyes
Daddy's coming home soon

On my knees everyday
All I do is pray baby just for you
Hope you'll always want me too
Daddy's coming home soon, oh yeah

It may be on a Sunday morning
It may be on a Tuesday afternoon
But no matter what the day is
I'm going to make it my business to get home soon

You're a thousand miles away
But I still have your love to remember you by
Oh, my darling dry your eyes
Daddy's coming home soon, oh yeah

It may be on a Sunday morning
It may be on a Tuesday afternoon
But no matter what the day is
I'm going to make it my business to get home soon

You're a thousand miles away
But I still have your love to remember you by
Oh, my darling dry your eyes
Daddy's coming home soon
