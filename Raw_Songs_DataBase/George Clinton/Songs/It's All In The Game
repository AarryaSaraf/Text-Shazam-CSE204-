Many a tear has to fall
But it's all in the game
All in the wonderful game
That we know as love

You have words with him
And your future's looking dim
But these things your heart can rise
Heart can rise above (oh yeah)

Once in a while he won't call
But it's all in the game
Soon he'll be there at your side
With a sweet bouquet (with a sweet bouquet)

Then he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away

Then he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away
...
