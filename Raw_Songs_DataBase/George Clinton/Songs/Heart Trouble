Worry angel's got a hold on me
I can't think for myself
I'm turnin' gray from being blue
You've found someone else

This strangest thing is buggin' me
Without your face around
You've found another to do your lovin'
Me you have put down

And I'm sittin' here with a broken heart
Wishin' you'd come home
Sittin' here with achin' arms
I just can't go on

Heart trouble
My life just ain't worthwhile
Without your love
I can't even force a smile

I'm trudging water all through the house
I thought was from a leakin' sink
I phoned the plumber to rush right over
See if he could fix the leak

He rushed right in and he took a look
Much to my surprise
He said, my son it's not your sink
It's teardrops from your eye

And I'm sittin' here with a broken heart
Wishin' you'd come home
Sittin' here with achin' arms
I just can't go on

Heart trouble
My life just ain't worthwhile
Without your love
I can't even force a smile

Heart trouble
You know that my life just ain't worthwhile
Without your love
Can't even force a smile

I chew my nails off one by one
Only got one to go
And until I see your face again
Nails I have no more

My nerves are shot, I smoke a lot
In this loneliness
And until I see your face again
My poor heart won't rest

And I'm sittin' here with a broken heart
Wishin' you'd come home
Sittin' here with achin' arms
I just can't go on

Heart trouble
My life just ain't worthwhile
Without your love
I can't even force a smile

Heart trouble
My life just ain't worthwhile
Without your love
You know I can't even force a smile

My nerves are shot, I smoke a lot
In this loneliness
And until I see your face again
The lonely heart won't rest

Heart trouble
Without your love
