From nowhere through a caravan
Around the campfire light
A lovely woman in motion
With hair as dark as night

Her eyes like a cat in the dark
They hypnotize me with love

She was a gypsy woman, a gypsy woman
She was a gypsy woman, a gypsy woman

She danced around and around
To a guitar melody
Her face was all aglow
How she enchanted me

And oh, I'd like to hold her near
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

I love you gypsy woman, gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman, gypsy woman

Yeah, gypsy woman, love you gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman

All through the caravan
She was dancing with all the men
Waiting for the rising sun
Everyone was having fun

I hate to see the lady go
Knowing that she'll never know
I love her
Said, I love her

She was my gypsy woman, gypsy woman
I love you gypsy woman, yeah, gypsy woman

Love you gypsy woman, I love you gypsy woman
I love you gypsy, gypsy, gypsy woman
Gypsy woman, woman, I love you gypsy woman
