Sometimes this world
Has got me thinkin' about I'm losing my mind
Forever searching for love
One day a solid relationship I just will find
I will take away the negativity
With a little Funk and love we got the perfect melody
The queen will come and the prince will go
Consequently how when it's cold you get a little snow

Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?

The only sin of love that I've committed has been justified
Girl, all I want to do is show everywhere my love for you
Sometimes you're just hurtin' me
So stop and see what's goin' on
Before to this world high heaven blues eternally I will go
There's no word that can express how I feel about you
So why don't you relax your mind
While I just give away the Funk

Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Tell me, you've got to tell me

You've got to tell me will you rock the party
Until the break of dawn
Will you rock the funky party?
You'll fell the rhythm to make you move your body
Will you rock the funky party?
You'll feel the rhythm to make you move your body
Baby, we're gonna jammin' and rockin' and stompin'
Until the break of dawn (yeah, yeah)

Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Baby, let me tell you
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
Will you rock the party?
Will you rock the funky jam?
