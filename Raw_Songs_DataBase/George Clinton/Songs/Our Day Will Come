Our day will come and we'll have everything
We'll share the joy falling in love would bring
No one can tell me that I'm too young to know
I love you so and you love me

Our day will come if we just wait a while
No tears for us, think love and wear a smile
Our dreams have magic because
We'll always stay in love this way
Our day will come

No one can tell me that I'm too young to know
I love you so and you love me

Our dream have magic because
We'll always stay in love this way
Our day...
