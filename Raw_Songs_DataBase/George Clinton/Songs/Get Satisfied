Mad messiah, G.C.

The party is about to start
And when it comes to rap, you got to have a lot of heart
Because the music is jumping, pumping too
We got funk and it's just for you
Coming out with something can't be denied
Coming out with something get satisfied

Let's get satisfied, let's get satisfied
Got to get satisfied, never deny it
Come on, raise your hands
Let's get satisfied, let's get satisfied

Get, get, get, get it
Let's get satisfied, let's get satisfied

Hey ladies, now it's your turn
The music is jumping, you got to burn
Fellows don't you get jealous
Cause you got to raise your hands and jump for us
Now the music is jumping, pumping too
Huh, we got sounds headed just for you
Coming out with something can't be denied
Coming out with something get satisfied
Y'all get it?

Let's get satisfied, let's get satisfied

I'm in need of something that you'll never suit
Bit it don't make a difference any difference to me
Cause I'm gonna party and dance, you see?
Now the doors are open, you got to come in

Come and get satisfied, you never denied
Come on, raise your hands, make some noise!
