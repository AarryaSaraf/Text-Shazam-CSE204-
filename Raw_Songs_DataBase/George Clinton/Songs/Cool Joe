I once had a friend
His name was Joe
Joe sho' was cold
He said "I'll be a mack
I drive a Cadillac
Carry money in a sack, Joe"

Right on, Joe
Joe sho' was cold

As time went on, seen Joe
Joe sho' was cold
He drives a Cadillac
With three girls in the back
(Girls in the back)
He carried money in a sack
He had his hair laid back

Right on, Joe!
Joe sho' was cold

And as time went on, seen Joe
And Joe still was cold
He said "My rent is due
And my car note too
But I ain't worried
Cos my women will have it by afternoon"

Right on, Joe!
Joe sho' was cold
Cold Joe
On the other side
Of Cool Joe - Cold Joe

And as time went on
I got worried about Joe
And I asked Joe, I said
"Why you spent all your money on the blow?"
He said "'Cause I'm a mack
I drive a Cadillac
With three girls in the back
And see, I like it like that!"

Said right on, Joe
Joe, what cha gon' do, Joe?
What cha gon' do?
Joe sho' was cold

As time went on, seen Joe
This time Joe was all outta dough
No Cadillac, no girls in the back
He had no money in a sack
Joe, poor Joe
Joe, what cha gon' do, Joe?
I thought I told you so, uh
What cha gon' do, Joe?
Poor Joe
Joe, what cha gon' do, Joe?
I told you so
What cha gon' do, Joe...?
