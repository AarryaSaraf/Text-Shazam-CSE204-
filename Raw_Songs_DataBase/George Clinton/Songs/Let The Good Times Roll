Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let me thrill your soul
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Roll all night long

Come on, baby, and a listen to this
This is a something you just can't miss
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Roll all night long

Come on, baby, while the thrill is on
Come on, baby, rock me all night long
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Roll all night long

Come on, baby, just a close the door
Come on, baby, lets a rock some more
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Roll all night long

Feels so good when you're home
Come on, baby, rock me all night long

Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let me thrill your soul
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Roll all night long

Feels so good when you're home
Come on, baby, rock me all night long

Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Come on, baby, let me thrill your soul
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Roll all night long

Come on, baby, let the good times roll...
