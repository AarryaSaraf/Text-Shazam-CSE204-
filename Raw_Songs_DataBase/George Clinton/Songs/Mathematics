I've counted any evidence of love
In mind mathematically
I'm not too gladed about the kisses
I suppose you give, baby you made me insane
Tell me why don't you pay attention to my love?
I do adore you so
I keep on trying to focus your interest on me
As you can see, I miss and love you

Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest
Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest

I've taken the stick in the backbone, everytime
But I know how to resist you
Even if it's better to say I would like

Say oh my baby, y'all
I've been givin' you too many chances, baby
To me you were baby the only one, because

Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest
Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest

I've counted how many times
I've been tryin' to give my evidence to you, mathematically
And all the infringements of interest
Supposedly I've been missin'
My validation wouldn't mean to pay attention
I'm tryin' to focus your interest on me
I've been missin' you

Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest
Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest
Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of the interest

I've taken the stick in the backbone, everytime
But I know how to resist you
Even if it's better to say I would like
My love for you has been comin' into you too fast
And I've been givin' you too many chances, mathematically

Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest
Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest
Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest

Any evidence I've been givin' you
I've counted in my mind like a mathematics
Any infractions of interest
Make me naughty and evil
But I do love you baby, baby

Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Any evidence I've been givin' you
I've counted in my mind mathematically
I need your love, baby
I've been missin' you
Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest
Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest
Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean

Oh girl, you made me evil and naughty
But I do love you baby, baby
Like a mathematics I've been strugglin' to give you
Evidence of my love
Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest
Any percent of you
Is as good as the whole pie
Infractions of love mean
Evidence of interest
Any percent of you
