Love boat is sailing
You'll be dockin' tonight
Bringin' me love and then
You'll sail out of sight

There I go again
Break my heart again
And I'm goin' for it every time
For sure again
It shows again
And it's goin' in and out of my mind
Even if you're blind
You will see you're on my mind
There I go again
It shows again
And I'm goin' for it every time
There I go again
Break my heart again
And I'm goin' for it every line
For sure again
It shows again
And it's goin' in and out of my mind
Even if you're blind
You will see you're on my mind
It shows for sure again
And I'm goin' for it every time

Love boat is sailin'
You'll be dockin' tonight
Bringin' me love and then
You'll steal out of sight

There I go again
Break my heart again
But I'm comin' back to you
'Cause I know again
Once more again
That I've done the best that I can do
Even if you're blind
You will see you're on my mind
There I go again
Break my heart again
And I'm comin' back to you

Love boat is sailing
You'll be dockin' tonight
Bringin' me love and then
You'll steal out of sight

Even if you're blind
You will see you're on my mind

Even if you're blind
You will see you're on my mind

Love boat is sailing
You'll be dockin' tonight...
