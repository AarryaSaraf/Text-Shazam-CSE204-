Hello, I'm the computer game Dracula
I like to suck necks
I am out in my brain because I can now insane
And I'm up to my jugular with derays
But I'm a winner

I'm motherfunkenstein, and my son is crazy
I didn't teach him to suck no necks

Rockets and bombs blasting at my feet
Of course I can keep a beat
I'm your funky dancing computer game
And of course, I'm insane

May I invade your space?
How much money will you spend?
Do you ever really lend?
