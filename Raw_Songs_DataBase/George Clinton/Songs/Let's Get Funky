Let's get funky tonight, c'mon girl
Let's get funky
Let's get funky tonight, c'mon girl
Let's get funky

I know there is a party in the place
I know that you are on the One
But when it comes to you
I know how I can explain it
Don't dare get it too much, girl
And don't abuse it
Girl you, please, let me talk to you just one time
I'll tell you that I do love you, girl
So let me tell you how I feel about you

Let's get funky tonight, c'mon girl
Let's get funky
Let's get funky tonight, c'mon girl
Let's get funky

I know that you're empty of it into your brain
You know I want to give this to you away
But when it comes to you
I don't want to be afraid of you
Girl, I don't want you to give me worries about it
Girl you, please, let me talk to just one time
I'll tell you that I do love you
So, let's have a party tonight
Let's get funky

Let's get funky tonight, c'mon girl
Let's get funky
Let's get funky tonight, c'mon girl
Let's get funky
