I count the moments we're apart and add them up mathematically
And multiply them by the kisses supposedly I've been missing
Divided by the attention not to mention the affection
Subtract that from your gross potential
And see I ain't missin' none

Cause any percentage of you is as good the whole pie
An infraction thereof brings dividends of interest
Any percentage of you is as good as the whole pie
An infraction there of brings dividends of love

I take the square root and get boxed in every time
When I know the shortest distance between two points
Is it a straight line?
I gotta come in to you more, in to you two times
And get rid of one, over to where we equal one
Equal one

Cause any percentage of you is as good the whole pie
An infraction thereof brings dividends of interest
Any percentage of you is as good as the whole pie
An infraction there of brings dividends of love
