Fresh for '98...
Suckers

I've been duped and slimed before
I've been walked on like I was a floor
Bent out of shape
Is the shape that I'm in
I'm always glad to see the face of a good friend

Sticks and stones may break my bones
I can grow or I can pass it on
It's so hard to leave it alone
I'm always glad to see the face of a good friend

Why should I dog u out?

Get a little funk
Then you sell out
Shake a few rumps
Then you sold out
We did all of that
Without selling out

Get a little funk
Then you sell out
Shake a few rumps
Then you sold out
We did all of that
Without chillin' out

How much is that doggie in the window
The one with the waggly tail
How much is that doggie in the window
I do hope that doggie's for sale

I'm a blind dog with a seeing eye man
If I mistake you for a fire hydrant I hope you understand

Get a little funk
Then you sell out
Shake a few rumps
Then you sold out
We did all of that
Without selling out
