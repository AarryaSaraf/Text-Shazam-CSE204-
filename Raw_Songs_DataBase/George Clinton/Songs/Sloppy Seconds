Sloppy seconds make me wake up from my first impression
Sloppy seconds make time movin'
Sloppy seconds are tickin' and tockin' then go stand in line
Ticking in my head

Sloppy seconds make me wake up from my first impress
Sloppy seconds make me ride on the mothership
Sloppy seconds make the hourglass runs of out sand
If you have to ask what time is it

Sloppy seconds make me the clockwork swingle
Sloppy seconds make me wonder if there's a clock yet
Sloppy seconds make me know what time is currently
Sloppy seconds make the time ticking in my head

Sloppy seconds make me wake up from my very first impress
And make me ask what time is currently
Sloppy seconds make me wake up from my very first impress
And make me ask what time is currently

A time long gone I've been ridin' on the mothership
Sloppy seconds make the time movin' on too
I gave up the funk aboard the mothership
Time long gone I've been ridin' on the mothership
I gave up the funk aboard the mothership
Time long gone I've been ridin' on the mothership

Da-da-da-da-da...

Sloppy seconds make me wake up from my first impress
Sloppy seconds make me ridin' on the mothership
Sloppy seconds make me wake up from my first impress
Sloppy seconds make me ridin' on the mothership
