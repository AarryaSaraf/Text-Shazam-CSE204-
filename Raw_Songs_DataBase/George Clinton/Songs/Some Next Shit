Fight for your right to cuss, fuss, bust the rhyme
Yo, if that ain't enough
Fight for your right to cuss, fuss, bust the rhyme
Yo, if that ain't enough
Fight for your right to cuss, fuss, bust the rhyme
Yo, if that ain't enough

Yo, no loudspeakers, but I'm speaking loud
Vehnacular ass kickin' truth out to the crowd!

The tick was clockin' the tock
Dockin' every muthafuckin'
Hickory dickory mice runnin' up the clock
Shit hits you in your gut
In your poot butt

I can't hear you!
I don't hear you
I still can't hear you
Of course it's gang related, there's a gang of us on the stage
Damn right it's drug related, this shit is dope
Your turn
Funk-ya My lordy (oh lordy)
No matter how derogatory, auditory
Oh lordy A P-Funk
Oh Miss Smarty-Ain't nothin' but a party

So hickory dickory dock
Tick tock (tick tock)
Funk around the clock
Poot butt
Pre-P, pocket-pickin' petty piss poor punkass punks
Posin' to be perpetrators, posin' with the funk
Proudly displayin' your P-Funk signs
Quit it, I ain't wit it
Get them dick beaters off of the microphone
(Your poetry stink)
Take your dead ass home
Shit, piss, hell, damn, fuck
What kind of language is that you honorary cuss?

Watch the watchdog watchin' it all on a stopwatch
The kooks going coo-koo for a sun clock
No loudspeakers, but I'm speaking outloud
Vehnacular ass-kickin' truth out a crowd
The tick was clockin' the tock
Doggin' every muthafuckin' hickory dickory dock
Mice runnin' up a muthafuckin' clock
What time is it?
Funk is what time it is
