She wore a Fila mentality
Sporting a beeper
On her hips
Good to go Kangol
With some tight mobile jeans
Ooh, I mean
Totally good and fresh
Totally serious

She got it goin' on
She got it goin' on
She got it goin' on
She got it goin' on

A-plus student
Soon to be
A college grad
Two jobs
Hang out all night long
Tell me
Ain't the girl bad?
She got it goin' on
She got it goin' on
The girl's
Got it goin' on
She got it goin' on

Something about
Some student unrest
In solidarity
With the Third World
You know the girl
Raised a fist
She said
Economical terrorism
Was at the bottom
Of it all
And at the top
Was a fat cat
And Humpty Dumpty
Is about to fall

Real weird hairstyles
Curls of Jheri

Politically
The girl's head is scary
Activist
Active fist
Activator
Active later
