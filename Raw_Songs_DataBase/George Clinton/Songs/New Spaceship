As I prepare myself to play live
As I rehearse the songs that I've recorded
I've been finding a new spaceship
Everybody in the place
Will you stand by me on the new spaceship?

A new spaceship has landed, now
A new spaceship has landed
A new spaceship has landed
From the dawn lights to the dark

A new spaceship baby, how I feel about you
How I feel alright, you're my delight
I feel freaky and so distorted
I've got my freakin' heart broken, now
And I will go to the corner about you
My pain for the freak of you
I've freaked out for the freak of you
Tweaked out for your tweaking
Speaked out before I speak to you
(Tweaked out)
(Speaked out before I speak to you)

Make it last or you'll make me out of this world
Think about when you guaranteed that we'd have good time

What's goin' on seems to me
I've never ever used to be
Probably I've let things go freeze

A new spaceship is here
A new spaceship is here

Like plantations grown in this world since it began
What can't be wrong, baby?
So welcome aboard, baby
Let's sit down across the new spaceship
Let's travel now the whole planetary system
Above the Earth
Time now is tweakin'
Time now goes freakin'
Freakin' out for the freak of you
