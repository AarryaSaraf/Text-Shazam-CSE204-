Only playin' the class gigs
Never makin' it to the bridge
We've got R&B skeletons in the closet
Sing and play, but never shout
For if we do, we would let it out
We've got R&B skeletons in the closet

Though he's crossed over
He's definitely from down under the bridge
He used to take it there
Songs we used to sing, things we used to do
Ah, we do no more

Party started long ago
But there's no one on the floor
Get that classic R&B out the closet
"Sex Machine" by James Brown
Funkadelic throwin' down
Don't you know that's how the party started?

Though he's crossed over
He's definitely from down under the bridge
He used to take you there
Songs we used to sing, things we used to do
Ah, we don't do no more!

Only play the class gigs
Never takin' it to the bridge
We've got R&B skeletons in the closet
Sing and play, but never shout
Never really turnin' it out
R&B skeletons in the closet

Party started long ago
But there's no one on the floor
Get that classic R&B out the closet
"Sex Machine" by James Brown
Funkadelic throwin' down
They know how to get a party started!
We've got R&B skeletons in the closet

He used to take you there...
