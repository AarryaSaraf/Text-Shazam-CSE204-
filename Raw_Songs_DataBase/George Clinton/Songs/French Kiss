Ooh ooh ooh boy
Gitchi gitchi goo boy
Feel like Frenchin' you

Put your mouth on me, baby
Put your mouth on me
Put your mouth on me, baby
Put your mouth on me
Put your mouth on me, baby
Put your mouth on me
Put your mouth on me, baby
Put your mouth on me

I want your mouth all over my mouth
So part your lips and let me through
I got a red-hot-throbbin' of love
For you mama
But first I wanna tongue-kiss you

Put your mouth on me, baby
Put your mouth on me

Part your lips and let me through
Ooh girl, I like the way it feels
When you stick your tongue in my mouth
And when, you do those sexy faces
It makes my body crazy
It really really drives me wild

Ooh ooh ooh girl
Gitchi gitchi goo girl
Feel like Frenchin' you
Ooh ooh ooh girl
Gitchi gitchi goo girl
Feel like Frenchin' you

Put your mouth on me, baby
Put your mouth on me

My lips are impatient
They quiver and shake
Everytime you're over my place
Like Henry Fonda said
To Katherine Hepburn in the movies
"Let's go suck face"
Put your mouth on me, baby...

Put your mouth on me, baby
Put your mouth on me

Whether lust or whether it's a burnin' need
I wanna taste your luscious lips
Part your lips and let me through

Ooh ooh ooh girl
Gitchi gitchi goo girl
Feel like Frenchin' you
Ooh ooh ooh girl
Gitchi gitchi goo girl
Feel like Frenchin' you
Ooh ooh ooh girl
Gitchi gitchi goo girl
Feel like Frenchin' you
Ooh ooh ooh girl
Gitchi gitchi goo girl
Feel like Frenchin' you

Put your mouth on me, baby
Put your mouth on me
Part your lips and let me through
Put your mouth on me, baby
Put your mouth on me
Put your mouth on me, baby
Put your mouth on me
Put your mouth on me, baby
Put your mouth on me
Part your lips and let me through
Put your mouth on me, baby
Put your mouth on me
Put your mouth on me, baby
Put your mouth on me
