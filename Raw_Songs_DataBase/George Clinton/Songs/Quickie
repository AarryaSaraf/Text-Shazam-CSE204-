As I stepped out of my limousine
A little Mercedes pulled next to me
She was quick and straight to the point
Ah, can I have your number, please?

All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie

Girl, wanna get next to me, ow
She rushed me home, she can see the dog in me
She said you do it right
Pretty baby, gotta stay all night

Little baby, wanna be your man
Uh, uh this is just a one night stand

All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie

If you are to make me happy
Got to make it snappy
Make it quick
You know it was a quickie

Gotta do it right, don't take all night
Licking the split, make it quick
Gotta do it right, don't take all night
Make it quick, licking the split

Gotta do it right, don't take all night
Licking the split, make it quick
Gotta do it right, don't take all night
Make it quick, licking the split

She likes to spread her love around
She likes to spread her love around
She likes to spread her love around
She likes to spread her love around

She likes to spread her love around
She likes to spread her love around
She likes to spread her love around

All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie

Make it quick, make it quick
Make it quick
Gotta do it right and don't take all night
Gotta do it right and don't take all night

All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie

She said to make me happy
And make it snappy
All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie

All she wanted was a quickie
All she wanted was a quickie
