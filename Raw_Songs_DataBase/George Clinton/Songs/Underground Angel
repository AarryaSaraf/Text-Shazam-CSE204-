Standing on the earth's stratosphere
That's what I really do
When I stay aboard the mothership
When I head up high to the sky
Then I dedicate you a song, and you get it

There's a girl uptight that you don't like the funk
And you don't like to boogie with her
Nobody knows how to solve the problem
There's a party in the neighborhood
I think about that maybe they get funky
The mothership was gettin' ready for the next trip
But I've moved here to the party to the save the funk
'Cause I'm an angel landed to the underground

Baby, pretty little angel
Come here to rescue me and take me underground

Hey what's your name, man?
My name is knee deep, tales of kidd funkadelic
America eats its young
Cosmic slop, hardcore jollies
Maggot brain, one nation under a groove
Check out my shit, haven't you had enough of it?
The electric spanking of war babies
Uncle jam wants you
Standing on the verge of gettin' it on
Do you want a little more?
Let's take it to the stage

Baby, pretty little angel
Come here to rescue me and take me underground
Baby, pretty little angel
Come here to rescue me and take me underground

I love your funk, I do like it
I want the funk playing like a G.I. Joe
I've got to boogie all day
So what would you like to do, so let me know
The neighborhood party broke the ground
So what would you like to do, so let me know
And caused ground vibrations all around
And crashed the house roofs like dinosaurs on glass
So like I've said before

Baby, pretty little angel
Come here to rescue me and take me underground
Baby, pretty little angel
Come here to rescue me and take me underground

I do like the funk, I do like it
I want the funk playing like a G.I. Joe
I've got to boogie all day
There's a party in the neighborhood, it will last until night
It makes me feel like dancin' all day
The neighborhood party will break the ground
And cause ground vibrations all around
And crash the house roofs like dinosaur on glass
So like I've already said before

Baby, pretty little angel
Come here to rescue me and take me underground
Baby, pretty little angel
Come here to rescue me and take me underground
Baby, pretty little angel
Come here to rescue me and take me underground
Baby, pretty little angel
Come here to rescue me and take me underground
