Are we going to the heaven's height?
Maybe we can fly high
Before you go
Far away into Bangladesh

And when after the winter
The spring flowers have bloomed
I was walking in this
Beautiful garden with you
Until I like the way you want me to
I'll remain the prisoner in your dream
Wake!

So are we going to get at home?
They say that you want to come
Before you go
Far away into Bangladesh

Like a stopped watch
I wait you here to stay
I'll provide
How I gave you into my heartbeat
Spreading love
Spreading love
Spreading love

So are we going to get at home?
They say that you want to come
Before you go
Far away into Bangladesh
