// Let's Do It (Let's Fall In Love) //

When the little blue birds
Who have never said a word
Start to say spring spring
When the little blue bell
In the bottom of the dell
Starts to ring ding ding
When the little blue clerk
In the middle of its work
Starts to tune to the moon up above
It is nature that's simpling telling us to fall in love....
Oh, yes and that's why...

Birds do it, bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love...

In Spain the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Finns
Folks in Siam do it
Just think of the Siamese twins
Some Argentines, without means do it
People say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love...

Romantic sponges they say do it
Oysters down in Oyster Bay do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

Cold Cape Cod clams, 'gainst their wish, do it
Even lazy jellyfish do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

Electric eels, I might add, do it
Though it shocks 'em I know
Why ask if shad do it
Waiter, bring me shadroe
In shallow shoals, English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it
Let's fall in love...

Dragonflies in the reeds do it
Sentimental centipedes do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

Mosquitoes, heaven forbid, do it
So does every katydid do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

The most refined ladybug do it
When a gentleman calls
Moths in your rugs do it
Well let me ask, what's the use of balls?

Locusts in the trees do it
Why, even the bees do it
Even all educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love...

I said
The chimpanzees in the zoo do it
Some courageous kangaroos do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...
Oh, fall in love...

I'm sure that girafes on the slide do it
Every hippopotami do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

Oh, sloths who hang down from the twigs do it
Though the effort is great
Yes, sweet guinea pigs do it
Buy a couple and wait

Now the world admits bears in the pits do it
Even pekigneses in the Ritz do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

// Now You Has Jazz //

Dear gentlefolk of Newport
Or maybe I should
Say hats and cats

I want you to lend an ear
Because, well, I want you
To hear some really
Shimmering sharps and flats

For these cozy virtuosi
Just about the greatest
In the trade are fixing
To show you now, precisely how
Or approximately
Jazz music is made

Well, you take some skins
Jazz begins
Then you take a bass
Man, now we're
Getting someplace

Take a box
One that rocks
Take a blue horn
New Orleans born

You take a stick
With a lick
Take a bone
Ho ho, hold the phone

Take a spot
Cool and hot
Now you has jazz, jazz
Jazz, jazz, jazz

That's positively theraputic
Now you has jazz, jazz, jazz

Masters Hall and Young
That's Ed Hall
And Tommy Young

Now you has Masters
Kyle and Shaw
That's Billy Kyle
Arvil Shaw

Now you has Mr. Barrett Deems
And now listen to, well, you know who

Hey, Pops, you wanna grab a little, leave a little

Yeah, Daddy, yeah
Here we go

If you sail
(Sailing, sailing)
Over the sea
(Will you wait for me)
Take my tip, they're all
Molto hip in Italy
(Well, Arrevederci)

(As for France)
Oh, I know you're
Very big there
(Yes, believe it or not)
I do believe, I do indeed
(Frenchmen all prefer what
They call le jazz hot)

Take a plane
(Bobba doo zot)
Go to Siam in Bangkok
Today round the clock
Well, they all like to jam

Indians on the Amazon
Beat one bar and
All of them are
(Well, gone, man, gone)

From the Equator
Up to the Pole
Everybody winging
Everybody singing
That rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock and roll

From the East to the West
From the coast to the coast
Jazz is king cause jazz is
The thing folks, dig, best

That's jazz
