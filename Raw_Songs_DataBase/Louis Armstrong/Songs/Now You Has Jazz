Dear gentlefolk of Newport
Or maybe I should
Say hats and cats

I want you to lend an ear
Because, well, I want you
To hear some really
Shimmering sharps and flats

For these cozy virtuosi
Just about the greatest
In the trade are fixing
To show you now, precisely how
Or approximately
Jazz music is made

Well, you take some skins
Jazz begins
Then you take a bass
Man, now we're
Getting someplace

Take a box
One that rocks
Take a blue horn
New Orleans born

You take a stick
With a lick
Take a bone
Ho ho, hold the phone

Take a spot
Cool and hot
Now you has jazz, jazz
Jazz, jazz, jazz

That's positively theraputic
Now you has jazz, jazz, jazz

Masters Hall and Young
That's Ed Hall
And Tommy Young

Now you has Masters
Kyle and Shaw
That's Billy Kyle
Arvil Shaw

Now you has Mr. Barrett Deems
And now listen to, well, you know who

Hey, Pops, you wanna grab a little, leave a little

Yeah, Daddy, yeah
Here we go

If you sail
(Sailing, sailing)
Over the sea
(Will you wait for me)
Take my tip, they're all
Molto hip in Italy
(Well, Arrevederci)

(As for France)
Oh, I know you're
Very big there
(Yes, believe it or not)
I do believe, I do indeed
(Frenchmen all prefer what
They call le jazz hot)

Take a plane
(Bobba doo zot)
Go to Siam in Bangkok
Today round the clock
Well, they all like to jam

Indians on the Amazon
Beat one bar and
All of them are
(Well, gone, man, gone)

From the Equator
Up to the Pole
Everybody winging
Everybody singing
That rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock and roll

From the East to the West
From the coast to the coast
Jazz is king cause jazz is
The thing folks, dig, best

That's jazz
