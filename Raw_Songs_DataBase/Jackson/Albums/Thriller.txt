// Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' //

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothin' he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just wanna be startin' somethin'

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always tryin'
To keep my baby cryin'
Treacherous, cunnin', declinin'
You got my baby cryin' (Hee)

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
Still they hate you (Still they hate you)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're just a buffet (You're just a buffet) (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
They eat off of you (They eat off of you) (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable, aaow!

Billie Jean is always talkin' when nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', spyin'
Sayin' you just wanna be startin' somethin'

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
Still they hate you (Still they hate you)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're just a buffet (You're just a buffet) (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
They eat off of you (They eat off of you) (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable, aaow!

Aaow!
Hee-haw! (Ooh!)

If you can't feed your baby (Yeah, yeah)
Then don't have a baby (Yeah, yeah)
And don't think maybe (Yeah, yeah)
If you can't feed your baby (Yeah, yeah)
You'll be always tryin'
To stop that child from cryin'
Hustlin', stealin', lyin'
Now baby's slowly dyin'

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

Lift your head up high and scream out to the world
"I know I am someone," and let the truth unfurl (Hee-ha)
No one can hurt you now because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me, so do believe in you

// The Girl Is Mine //

[Michael Jackson:]
Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine, m-m-m
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine, m-m-m

[Paul McCartney:]
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours, not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

I love you more than he

[Michael Jackson:]
(Take you anywhere)
Well, I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me to one town

But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever

[Paul McCartney:]
Don't build your hopes to be let down

[Michael Jackson:]
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

[Michael {Paul}:]
{She's mine, she's mine}
{No, no, no, she's mine}
The girl is mine, {the girl is mine}
The girl is mine, {the girl is mine}
{The girl is mine} (mine, mine); {yep, she's mine} (mine, mine)
{The girl is mine} (mine, mine); {yeah, she's mine} (mine, mine)

[Michael Jackson:]
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine

[Michael {Paul}:]
(Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay?)
Ha, ha, Paul, I think I told you I'm a lover, not a fighter
{Eh, I've heard it all before, Michael}
{She told me that I'm her forever lover, you know, don't you remember?}
Well, after loving me she said she couldn't love another
{Is that what she said?}
Yeah, she said it; you keep dreaming

{I don't believe it! Mine, mine}
(No, no, no) The girl is mine (Mine, mine, mine)
{No, mine} No, mine (Mine, mine)
{She's mine, mine, mine, mine, mine} (Mine, mine, mine)
'Cause the girl is mine
{No, the girl is mine} (Mine, mine)
The girl is mine (Mine, mine, mine)
{No, the girl is mine}
The girl is mine (Mine, mine)
(No, she's mine)

// Thriller //

[Michael Jackson:]
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurkin' in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes,
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
Yeah
Ooh

You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination, girl
But all the while you hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're outta time

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with the forty eyes, girl
Thriller, ooh, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh

They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side (ooh)
They will possess you unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night I'll save you from the terror on the screen,
I'll make you see

That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul could ever dare try
Thriller, ooh, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul could ever dare try
Thriller, ooh, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller (ow)

I'm gonna thrill you tonight

[Vincent Price:]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whomsoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

[Michael Jackson:]
I'm gonna thrill you tonight...

Thriller, ooh, babe (Thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)
Thriller, oh, darling (Oh, baby)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Ooh, babe (Thriller night)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
Oh, darling (Oh, baby)
Thriller night, babe (Thriller night, babe)
Ooh

[Vincent Price:]
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
(Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller

[Into maniacal laugh, in deep echo]

// Beat It //

They told him, "Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it (Ooh!)
You better run, you better do what you can (Ooh!)
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man (Ooh!)
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (Beat it)
Just beat it (Beat it)
Just beat it (Beat it)
Just beat it (Beat it, uh)

They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it (Ooh!)
You have to show them that you're really not scared (Ooh!)
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare (Ooh!)
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it (Hoo-hoo!)
No one wants to be defeated

// Billie Jean //

She was more like a beauty queen
From a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean
I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do.
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts."
And mother always told me, "A-be careful of who you love,
And be careful of what you do
'Cause the lie becomes the truth."

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

For forty days and for forty nights
Law was on her side
But who can stand
When she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice.)

She told, "My baby, we'd danced 'til three."
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cry
His eyes looked like mine, oh, no
Do a dance on the floor in the round, baby

A-people always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts."
(Don't break no heart.)
A-but she came and stood right by me
And just the smell of sweet perfume
And this happened much too soon
And she called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

No, no, no

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
(No, there's not me, baby.)
But the kid is not my son
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no.)
She says I am the one (No, babe.)
But the kid is not my son, no, no, no

She says I am the one
You know what you did
She says he is my son
Breaking my heart, babe
She says I am the one

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
Don't call me Billie Jean
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
She stumbled onto the scene
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover

// Human Nature //

Why?

Looking out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Just tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
(She's giving in by keeping him a'round)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
(That way) Why? Oh, why?
(That way) Why? Oh, why?

Looking out, across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say why (why?), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
(She's giving in by keeping him a'round)
Ooh-ooh, tell 'em!
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?

If they say why (why?), why (why?), why (why?)
Cha-da-cha-sha-sha-sha-sha-sha (aah-ah)
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why? Why?), why (why? Why? Why?)
(She's giving in by keeping him a'round)
Ooh-ooh, tell 'em! (aah-ah)
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?), why (why?)
Ooh, tell 'em!
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?), why (why?)
(She's giving in by keeping him a'round)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Why (why?), why (why?), does he do me that way?
I like living this way

Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)
Why? Oh, why? (that way)

// Carousel //

She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing
I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd, oh-oh

I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories

I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me

Don't you know?
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away

I lost my heart (Lost my heart)
I lost (On the carousel)
I lost my girl (To a circus girl)
Who left my heart in pieces
(Lost my heart) Lost my heart
(On the carousel) Lost my girl (To a circus girl)
Who ran away
I lost (Lost my heart)
I lost my girl (On the carousel)
Ooh, oh, lost, oh, lost (To a circus girl)
I lost
I lost my heart (Lost my heart)
I lost (On the carousel)
I lost my girl (To a circus girl)
