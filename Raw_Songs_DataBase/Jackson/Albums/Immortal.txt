// Childhood (Immortal Version) //

Many of our world's problems today
Are a result of the fact that children have had their childhood stolen from them
The magic, the wonder, the mystery, and the innocence of a child's heart
Are the seeds of creativity that will heal the world
I really believe that

Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood I've never known
Have you seen my Childhood?

When I create my music, I feel like an instrument of nature
I wonder what delight nature must feel when we open our hearts and express our God-given talents
What we need to learn from children isn't childish
They know the way to summon things that lie waiting to be recognized within our own hearts

People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood (Childhood) I've never known

Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

Have you seen my Childhood?

// Ben (Immortal Version) //

Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you, my friend, will see
You've got a friend in me
(You've got a friend in me)

Ben, you're always running here and there
(Here and there)
You feel you're not wanted anywhere (Anywhere)
If you ever look behind and don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go)

I used to say I and me
Now it's us, now it's we
(I used to say, I and me
Now it's us, now it's we)

Ben, most people would turn you away
(Turn you away)
I don't listen to a word they say
(A word they say)
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben
(A friend) like Ben (like Ben)
Like Ben

// This Place Hotel (Immortal Version) //

Hee!

Live and sin
Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearning
I promised I would never, ever be returning
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning
Hee! Hee!
As we walked into the room
There were faces staring, glaring, tearing through me
Someone said, "Welcome to your doom"
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me

This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So evil Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel

Someone stop my heart (Heartbreak hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hee! (Heartbreak hotel)
Ten years ago today (Heartbreak hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hee! (Heartbreak hotel)

We came to this place where the vicious dwell
Found that wicked women run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue
Every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through

OW!
(Annie, are you okay?)
(Are you okay, Annie?)

// Smooth Criminal (Immortal Version) //

OW!
As he came into the window
It was the sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you OK, Annie? Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you okay, are you okay, Annie?

Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sign in the window
That he struck you - a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

You've been hit by
You've been hit by a smooth criminal
OW!

// Dangerous (Immortal Version) //

[Michael Jackson:]
The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Female:]
One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust woman to man
So open the door, and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move, set me free

[Michael Jackson:]
I never knew but I was walking the line (Hee)
"Come go with me", I said, "I have no time" (Hee hee)
She said "Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone" (Hee)
My baby cried, she left me standing alone (Hee hee)

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee hee)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee hee) (Doggone)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

[Female (Michael Jackson):]
Just open the door, and you will see (Hee hee, ooh)
This passion burns inside of me (Ooh, hoo)
Don't say to me, you'll never tell
Touch me there, make the move
Cast the spell
(Keep it in the closet)

[Michael Jackson:]
Hoo
Hoo
Hoo
My baby
You been, you take, uh
You don't, don't, don't
You turn, my baby

// The Mime Segment: (I Like) The Way You Love Me / Speed Demon / Another Part of Me (Immortal Version) //

I love to write songs, it's one of my favorite things to do
It's very spiritual, it's a connection
I'm just the source through which it comes
I'm inspired by a lot of things that is done from the Heavens
I listen to the music and I just create from there
This is the tempo...and this is the melody
(One, two, three, four)
Ho

We're taking over, we have the truth
This is the mission, to see it through
Don't point your finger (Shoo), not dangerous
This is our planet, you're one of us

We're sending out, a major love
And this is our, message to you (Message to you)
The planets are lining up, we're bringing brighter days
They're all in line, waiting for you, can't you see
You're just another part of me
Hee hee, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Doo-doo-doo-doo
Ooh

Shoo, shoo
Shoo, shoo

// The Jackson 5 Medley: I Want You Back / ABC / The Love You Save (Immortal Version) //

[Michael Jackson (Jackson 5):]
Uh-huh huh huhhh
Let me tell ya now, hh-huh
(Mmhhmmm)

[Michael Jackson:]
When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

[Michael Jackson (Jackson 5):]
Oh, baby, give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me back in your heart?
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go
(Let you go, baby)
But now, since I see you in his arms

[Michael & Jermaine:]
You went to school to learn girl
Things you never, never knew before
Like "I" before "E" except after "C"
And why 2 plus 2 makes 4
Now, now, now, I'm gonna teach you
(Teach you, teach you)
All about love, girl
(All about love)
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

[Michael Jackson (Jackson 5):]
A B C
Easy as, 1 2 3
As simple as, do re mi
A B C, 1 2 3
Baby, you and me, girl
A B C
It's easy, it's like counting up to 3
1 2 3
Sing a simple melody
Do re mi, ABC
That's how easy love can be
That's how easy love can be
Sing a simple melody (That's how easy can be)
1 2 3, you and me

Hi-ya!
Sit down girl

Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be

[Jackson 5:]
Stop! Nanana! You'd better save it!
Stop, stop, stop, you'd better save it!
Woo!

[Michael Jackson:]
Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone
You'd better stop the love you save may be your own
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for a danger zone

[Jackson 5:]
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on

S is for "Save it"
T is for "Take it slow"
O is for "Oh, no"
P is for "Please, please, don't go! "

// Speechless / Human Nature (Immortal Version) //

Speechless

Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence I am lost for words
Words like, like, "I love you"

Human nature

Looking out
Across the night time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs

Get me out
Into the night time
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way

I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way

Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Why, why does he do me that way
I like livin' this way

// Is It Scary / Threatened (Immortal Version) //

[Part 1: Is It Scary]

I have seen the Book of Tales
Crafted by magical hands
Older than time itself
Its pages are filled with darkness
And mystery

[Michael Jackson:]
There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's climbing up the stairs
There's a spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air?
'Cause they're hiding everywhere

(Aaaahhh!)

Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, boy
Is it scary for you, baby
Is it scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby

Sorcery...Illusions

There's a creaking on the floor
There's a creep behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin nearly open
Where a restless soul is pokin'

I am gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Perform before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

I, I, I, I, I always feel
I, I, I, I, I - Somebody's watching me
I, I, I, I, I always feel
I, I, I, I, I - Somebody's watching me
I, I, I, I, I always feel
I, I, I always feel like somebody's watching me

[Rod Serling:]
A nightmare, that's the case
Never Never Land, that's the place
A monster, that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing you could fear

[Part 2: Threatened]

[50 Cent:]
All hail, the king has risen
All hail, hail, the king, hail, the king has risen
All hail, the king, king, king, king, king, the king has risen
All hail, the king, king, king, king, the king has risen

[Michael Jackson:]
You're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you

You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me
(Ooh hoo, come on, baby)
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened (Yeah)
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

[50 Cent:]
The king has risen

[Rod Serling:]
What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare
It isn't - it's the beginning

// Thriller (Immortal Version) //

[Michael Jackson:]
Ooh, uh, it's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking from the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller, OW!

I'm gonna thrill you tonight

[Vincent Price (Michael Jackson):]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe, ooh)
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

[Michael Jackson:]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, OW!
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

Ahahahahahahahaha
Ahahahahahahahaha!

// You Are Not Alone / I Just Can't Stop Loving You (Immortal Version) //

[You Are Not Alone]

[Michael:]
Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be? You're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me, why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

Every day I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone, 'lone

[I Just Can't Stop Loving You]

[Michael (Siedah):]
Each time the wind blows, I hear your voice so I call your name
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning, Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong, I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high, I long to get by, this time is forever, love is the answer
(I hear your voice now, you are my choice now, the love you bring)
(Heaven's in my heart, at your call, I hear harps and angels sing)
(You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong, I can't live my life without you)
I just can't hold on, (I feel we belong), my life ain't worth living, if I can't be with you


[Michael & Siedah:]
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do

[Siedah:]
'Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Michael (Siedah) {Both}:]
Noche de estrellas, haz que me quiera como a ella yo
(De madrugada, ven que te espera todo mi amor)
Soy joven, lo sé, pero siento que te quiero y solo vivo por ti
Me conoces bien y sabes también, que yo no puedo {vivir sin tu amor}

[Both (Michael):]
Todo mi amor eres tú, todo mi amor eres tú
(Oh, oh, and it feels)
Cuando no estás no hay quien me dé lo que das tú
(Uh-huh)
I just can't stop loving you

[Michael (Siedah) {Both}:]
(We can change all the world tomorrow)
We can sing songs of yesterday
(I can say, "Hey, Farewell" to sorrow)
This is my life and I {want to see you for always}

[Both:]
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
(No, baby, if I can't stop) (Oh)
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
(Oh! Oh! Oh, oh) (What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you, I just can't stop loving you
(Hee-hee-hee, without you, girl, you know I do)
And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you

[Michael:]
Remember the time
Remember the time
Remember the time

// Beat It / State of Shock (Immortal Version) //

They told him, "Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it...

You wanna see who's bad? You wanna see who's bad?
Come on, come on, let's do it

[Teddy Riley:]
Jam

[Heavy D:]
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam

[Teddy Riley:]
One, two, three

[Michael Jackson:]
Nation to nation
All the world must come together
Face the problems that we see
Then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor
She said later
What has come of all the people
Have we lost love of what it's about
I have to find my peace
'Cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom
What are the possibilities
I told my brother there'll be problems
Times and tears for fears
We must live each day like it's the last

Go with it, go with it, hoo

[Teddy Riley:]
Jam, you wanna get up
Jam, you wanna get up
Jam, you wanna get up
Jam, you wanna get up

[Heavy D:]
Jam, jam
Here comes the man, hot damn
The big boy stands with an upper hand
Making funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man, Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bumrushed the door, three and four's in a bundle
Execute the plan first I cooled like a fan
Got with Janet then with Guy now with Michael
'Cause it ain't hard to

[Michael Jackson:]
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to

It ain't, don't stop
It ain't too much for me to

// Planet Earth / Earth Song (Immortal Version) //

Planet Earth, my home, my place
A capricious anomaly in the sea of space
Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul
Planet Earth, gentle and blue
With all my heart, I love you

What about sunrise
What about rain
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain
What about killing fields
Is there a time
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores?

Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooooooh

I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far

Hey, what about yesterday
(What about us)
What about the seas
(What about us)
The heavens are falling down
(What about us)
I can't even breathe
(What about us)
What about apathy
(What about us)
I need you
(What about us)
What about nature's worth
(Ooh, ooh)
It's our planet's womb
(What about us)
What about the holy land
(What about it)
Torn apart by creed
(What about us)
What about the common man
(What about us)
Can't we set him free
(What about us)
What about children dying
(What about us)
Can't you hear them cry
(What about us)
Where did we go wrong
(Ooo, ooo)
Someone tell me why
(What about us)
What about baby Boy
(What about it)
What about the days
(What about us)
What about all their joy
(What about us)
What about the man
(What about us)
What about the crying man
(What about us)
What about Abraham
(What was us)
What about death again
(Ooh, ooh)
Do we give a damn

Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooooooh
Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooooooh

// Gone Too Soon (Immortal Version) //

Like a comet
Blazing 'cross the evening sky
Gone too soon
Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon

Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night

Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon
Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon
Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon

Born to amuse, to inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one night

Like a sunset
Dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon

Gone too soon

// They Don't Care About Us (Immortal Version) //

All the injustice

Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suite, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
Jew me, sue me, everybody do me
Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us (Hoo, hoo)
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us (Hoo, hoo)
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Some things in life they just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was living
He wouldn't let this be, no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't care about us
They don't care about us (Hoo, hoo)
They don't care about us (Hoo, hoo)

// Will You Be There (Immortal Version) //

Think about the generations and to say we want to make it a better world for our children and our children's children. So that they know it's a better world for them; and think if they can make it a better place

Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused will you show to me
You'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me

(Hold me) Show me
(Lay your head lowly) Lowly
(Softly then boldly) Yeah
(Carry me there) I'm only human
(Hold me)
(Love me and feed me) Yeah yeah yeah
(Kiss me and free me) Yeah
(I will feel blessed) I'm only human
(Carry) Carry
(Carry me boldly) Carry me, yeah
(Lift me up slowly) Yeah
(Carry me there) I'm only human
(Save me)
(Heal me and bathe me) Lift me up, lift me up
(Softly you say to me)
(I will be there) I will be there
(Lift me)
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me boldly) Yeah
(Show me you care) Show me you care
(Hold me) Woo!
(Lay your head lowly) Get lonely sometime
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there) Carry me there
(Need me) Hoo!
(Love me and feed me) Lift me up, hold me
(Kiss me and free me) Lift me up sometime
(I will feel blessed)

In our darkest hour
In my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence
In my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pains
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart

// I'll Be There (Immortal Version) //

I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there

If you should ever find someone new
I know he'd better be good to you
'Cause if he doesn't, I'll be there

Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there
Just call my name, I'll be there
Just look over your shoulders, honey, ooh
I'll be there, I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there
Just call my name, I'll be there

This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs

That's why I want you to know
