// Scream //

[Michael Jackson:]
I'm tired of injustice, I'm tired of the schemes
Your lies are disgusting
So what does it mean, damn it
Kickin' me down, I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damn it

[Janet Jackson:]
Peek in the shadow, come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're selling out souls, but I, I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight

[Michael Jackson (Janet Jackson) {Both}:]
With such confusion
Don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize)
{Somebody please have mercy}
{'Cause I just can't take it}

{Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me}
{Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream}
{Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me}
{Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream}
You just, you just

[Michael Jackson (Janet Jackson):]
I'm tired of you tellin' (Tellin')
The story your way (Story your way)
You're causin' confusion (Confusion)
You think it's okay, damn it
(You keep changin' the rules)
(While I, I keep playing the game)
(I can't take it much longer)
(I think I might go insane)
Ah, baby

[Michael Jackson (Janet Jackson) {Both}:]
With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(You find your pleasure scandalizing every lie)
{Oh Father, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it}

[Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson:]
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop fuckin' with me, make me wanna scream

"A man has been brutally beaten to death by police after being wrongly identified as a robbery suspect. The man was an 18-year-old black male..."

[Janet Jackson (Michael Jackson):]
Oh my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned on the TV
This evening, I was disgusted by all the injustice
All the injustice (All the injustice)
Yeah, yeah
(Baby) Whoa

[Michael Jackson (Janet Jackson) {Both}:]
With such collusions, don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme (Make you wanna scream)
(You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize)
{Oh brother, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it}

[Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson:]
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream

// They Don't Care About Us //

Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Bang bang, shot dead
Everybody's gone mad

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

Beat me, hate me
You can never break me
Will me, thrill me
You can never kill me
Jew me, sue me
Everybody do me
Kick me, kike me
Don't you black or white me

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

Tell me what has become of my life
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality, no
I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're raping me of my pride
Oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy...
Set me free

Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Trepidation, speculation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Black man, blackmail
Throw the brother in jail

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

Tell me what has become of my rights
Am I invisible because you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, no
I'm tired of being the victim of shame
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was living
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation, speculation
Everybody litigation
Beat me, bash me
You can never trash me
Hit me, kick me
You can never get me

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

Some things in life they just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was living
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

Skin head, dead head
Everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation
Everybody allegation
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Kick me, kike me
Don't you wrong or right me

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

// Stranger In Moscow //

I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

How does it feel (How does it feel)?
How does it feel?
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again...
Take my name and just let me be

How does it feel (How does it feel)?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel (How does it feel now)?
How does it feel?
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

How does it feel (How does it feel)?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel (How does it feel now)?
How does it feel?
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
Like a stranger in Moscow. Hee
Lord have mercy

We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow

We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow

I'm living lonely
I'm living lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow

I'm living lonely
I'm living lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow

[KGB interrogator in Russian:]
"Зачем приехал к нам ты, враг, от запада? Признайся.
Приехал чтобы украсть от нас великие достижения народа?
Великие труды рабочих?
Признайся. Подкупить народ богатством запада старался?"
[English translation:
"Why have you come, the enemy, from the west? Confess.
Have you come to steal from us the great achievements of the people?
The great accomplishments of the workers?
Confess. Have you tried hard to bribe the people with the riches of the west?"]

[The Notorious B.I.G. {Michael Jackson}:]
Listen, I got problems of my own (Uh)
Flashin' cameras, taps on my phone (Uh-huh)
Even in my home, I ain't safe as I should be
Things always missin', maybe it could be (Uh)
My friends, but they ain't friends if they robbin' me
Stoppin' me, from makin' a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean (Uh-huh), I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'
If I was dead broke and smokin', I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'm 'a kill a nigga, I ain't joking, Indo smoke got me chokin', (Uh-huh)
I'm hopin' a fool come slippin', so I can blow him open
This time around I changed up my flow (Uh-huh)
Got rid of the Rotts, got Pits by the door (Uh)
A real set of peoples to watch my back (Uh-huh)
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that
Baby {This time around, yeah}

// Earth Song //

What about sunrise?
What about rain?
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain?

What about killing fields?
Is there a time?

Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, this weeping shore?

Ah, ooh

What have we done to the world?
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son?

What about flowering fields?

All the children dead from war?

// Money //

Money
Money
Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it

So you call it trust but I say it's just
In the devil's game of greed and lust
They don't care, they'd do me for the money
They don't care, they use me for the money
So you go to church and read the Holy word
In the scheme of life, it's all absurd
They don't care
They'd kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge
You're called the "Just Few"
And you're fighting the wars, a soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but

If you show me the cash, then I will take it
If you tell me to cry, then I will fake it
If you give me a hand, then I will shake it
You would do anything for money

Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you
Would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil

Insurance?
Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi? I don't think so
You don't care, you'd do her for the money
Say it's fair, you sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul 'cause your God is such
You don't care, you kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers
'Cause they're the backstabbers

If you know it's a lie, then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt, then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance, then you will dare it
You would do anything for money

Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil

Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah)
Anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil

You say you wouldn't do it for all the money in the world
I don't think so
If you show me the man, then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie, then I will tell him
If you're dealing with God, then you will hell him
You would do anything for money

Anything (Ah)
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything

// You Are Not Alone //

Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be? You're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me, why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

Every day, I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens, I will bear
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin

Every day I sit and ask myself, "How did love slip away?"
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

Oh, whisper three words and I'll come runnin', fly
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
That you are not alone, I am here with you
(You are not alone, I am here with you)
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
(Though you're far away, you and me)
But you are not alone, I am here with you
(You are always in my heart)
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone (Not alone, oh)

You are not alone, you are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone
If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh!
Together, together
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!
You believe in me!

// Childhood //

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding 'round
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
Look within your heart, then ask
Have you seen my childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood (Childhood)
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

Have you seen my childhood?

// Tabloid Junkie //

Speculate to break the one you hate
Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
As the hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next, for you to resurrect?
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
As the blackmail story in all your glory

It's slander
You say it's not a sword
But with your pen you torture men
You'd crucify the Lord
And you don't have to read it, read it
And you don't have to eat it, eat it
To buy it is to feed it, feed it
Then why do we keep fooling ourselves?

Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
They say he's homosexual

In the hood, frame him if you could
Shoot to kill, to blame him if you will
If he dies sympathize
Such false witnesses, damn self-righteousness
In the black, stab me in the back
In the face, to lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
As the headline stories of all your glory

It's slander
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it, buy it
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it
Then why do we keep fooling ourselves

Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
She's blonde and she's bisexual

Scandal
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it, buy it
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it
Why do we keep fooling ourselves
Slander
You say it's not a sin
But with your pen you torture men
But why do we keep fooling ourselves

Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
You're so damn disrespectable

// 2 Bad //

I wake up my girl, get me mad right
The king of rock come on and there is none higher
Sucker MCs should call me sire
Standin' out here
Talking, broking, never joking, smoking
Up on the corner
Do what they wanna
Get outta here
Hasta la vista

[Michael Jackson:]
Told me that you're doing wrong
Word out shocking all along
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwing rocks to hide your hands
You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done nothing for me
You are disgusting me
(Yeah yeah)
You're aiming just for me
You are disgusting me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad

Look who just walked in the place
Dead and stuffy in the face
Look who's standing, if you please
Try to bring me to my knees

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it?
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it?
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it?
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it?

Hell all up in Hollywood
Sayin' that you got it good
Creepin' from another hole
Tell her what somebody told
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Tired of you hunting me
(Yeah yeah)
You're aiming just for me
You are disgusting me
You got blood lust for me
But too bad, too bad

Look who got slapped in the face
It's dead and stuffy in the place
I'm right back where I wanna be
I'm standing though you're kicking me

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it

[Shaquille O'Neal:]
Life's about a dream
I'm really undefeated when MJ's on my team
Theme
Reality brings forth realism
It's the man of steel
Organism, T.W.I.S.M
I'm full of trisim
Take charge like manila
9-5 Shaq represent with the thriller
Grab my crotch, twist my knees, and I'm through
Mike's bad, I'm bad, who are you?

[Michael Jackson:]
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it

Too bad too bad about it

// HIStory //

He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fires deep in his eyes

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody sing...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Don't let no one get you down
Keep moving on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self-motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And leave one family oh...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

A soldier dies
A mother cries
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

// Little Susie //

Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon...

A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh the blood in her hair...
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care,
Oh the blood in her hair...

Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head...
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain...

But only the man from next door
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes...
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair...

It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there...

She knew no one cared...

Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown...
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers...

Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live...
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fair

// Smile //

Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by...

If you smile
With your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile 
If you just...

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just...

Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by...

If you smile
Through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile...

That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
