Album: GotToBeThere

// Ain't No Sunshine //

You ever want something
That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it
The more you want it
And then one day you get it
It's so good to you
But it's just like my girl
When she's around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
'Cause, ooh

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away, hey

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
(Anytime she goes away) Mm

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, know
I know, know, know, know, know
Oh, I know, I know
Hey, I ought to leave (Ought to leave)
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
Only darkness every day
(Only darkness every day)
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just is no home
Anytime she goes away
(Anytime she goes away)

(Ain't no sun) Oh
(Ain't no sun)
(Na-na-na-na na-na-na) Oh
(Na-na-na) Oh, oh
Anytime she goes away

Ain't no sun
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
When she's gone
(It's not warm when she's away)
It's not warm when she's away
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
(It's not warm when she's away)
Anytime she goes away
(Only darkness every day)
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
Whenever that little girl goes away
Na na na na na
(It's not warm when she's away)
(Only darkness every day)
Anytime she goes away

(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone) Come on, now
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
Come on, baby, anytime she goes away
(Only darkness every day) Na na na
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)

Oh, anytime she goes away
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone) Na-na-na, oh
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
Anytime when she goes away
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone) Oh
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)

// I Wanna Be Where You Are //

Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time, let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry, 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've learned the meaning to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay

Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
Well, it's not my thing trying to get back
But this time, let me tell you where I'm at

I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh oh
Anywhere you are, oh oh
I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh oh
Everywhere you are, oh

Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside

I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh oh
Any, any, anywhere you are, oh oh
I wanna, wanna be where you are, oh oh
I gotta, gotta be where you are, oh oh

I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
Yeah, yeah, baby, now
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
Ooh, I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
Na na, yeah yeah
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh

I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
Na na, baby
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
I wanna be, I wanna be, oh
Ooh ooh, baby

(No, no, no)

(No, no, no)
No, no (No, no, no)
(No, no, no)
Ooh

Foolish of me, I couldn't see
The forest for the trees
You've been so true
I've been so cruel to you
Oh, girl, please don't leave me

If you stay, I'll find a way
To erase the past
Baby, don't leave me
Girl, don't take your love from me
Oh, girl

What can I say to make you stay?
Baby, don't leave me
You've been so kind
It blows my mind to know
Oh, girl, I really hurt you

Tell me, girl, it's not too late
And you'll give me a chance
To make it up to you
Don't take your love from me
Girl, don't take your love

(Don't take your
Don't take your
Don't take your love)

Girl, if you take your love away from me (No, no, no)
I'm gonna be in misery (No, no, no)
Your love is the strength that I lean upon (Don't take your love from me)
How will I make it when it's gone?
Of all the little things I wanted to say (No, no, no)
Or really wanted to do (No, no, no)
Girl, this time (No, no, no)
Ooh
Oh, girl, I really mean it

So tell me girl, it's not too late
And you'll give me a chance
To make it up to you
Don't take your love from me
Girl, don't take your love

Don't take your love from me (No, no, no)
Baby, don't take your love from me (No, no, no)
Ooh, don't take your love from me (No, no, no)
Baby, don't take your love from me (No, no, no)

Ooh, don't take your love from me (No, no, no)
Baby, don't take your love from me (No, no, no)

// Got To Be There //

Got to be there (Got to be there)
Got to be there in the morning
When she says hello to the world
Got to be there (Got to be there)
Got to be there, bring her good times
And show her that she's my girl

Oh, what a feeling there'll be
The moment I know she loves me
'Cause when I look in her eyes, I realise
I need her sharing her world beside me

So I've got to be there (Got to be there)
Got to be there in the morning
And welcome her into my world
And show her that she's my girl
When she says, "Hello, world!"
(Got to be there)

I need her sharing the world beside me

That is why I've got to be there (Got to be there)
Got to be there where love begins
And that's everywhere she goes
I've got to be there so she knows
That when she's with me
She's home (Home, she's home)
(Home, she's home) Yeah

(Got to be there) Got to be there, got to be there
(Got to be there) Got to be there, got to be there
(Got to be there) Oh, baby, baby, got to be there, got to be there
(Got to be there) Got to be there, oh, to be there (Oh, baby, baby)
(Got to be there) Oh, got to be there, got to be there
(Got to be there) Oh, got to be there, got to be there
(Got to be there) (Oh, baby, baby) Got to be there

// Rockin' Robin //

Tweedily deedily dee, tweedily deedily dee
Tweedily deedily dee, tweedily deedily dee
Tweedily deedily dee, tweedily deedily dee
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet

He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hopping and a-bopping and singing his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet

Rockin' robin, rock rock
Rockin' robin
Blow, rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight

Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee
Every little bird in the tall oak tree
The wise old owl, the big black crow
Flapping their wings singing, "Go, bird, go"

Rockin' robin, rock rock
Rockin' robin
Blow, rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight
Yeah, yeah!

Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
They started going steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the Buzzard and the Oriole

He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hopping and a-bopping and singing his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet

Rockin' robin (Tweet, tweedily dee), rock, rock
Rockin' robin (Tweet, tweedily dee)
Blow, rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight

Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
They started going steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the Buzzard and the Oriole

He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hopping and a-bopping and singing his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street

// Wings Of My Love //

When this old world gets you down
When your spirit's on the ground
Just remember I will always be around
Just climb on the wings of my love
I'll take you high on the wings of my love

When you're feeling all alone
Like a child who's got no home
You know you've always got a place where you can go
Just climb on the wings of my love

Like a beach that knows no boundaries with all the trees
As it rushes to the seas, darling, we'll be just as free
I'll lift your spirits high, our love will fly
We'll have heaven, blue skies, and forever sunshine

'Til you break those ties that bind
'Til that day you're really mine
Anytime you want to leave your world behind
Just climb on the wings of my love

Do-doo-doo-do-doo
Do-doo-do-doo
Doo-do-doo-do-doo-do

Oh, I'll lift your spirits high, our love will fly
We'll have heaven, blue skies, and forever sunshine

We've got rainbows yet to find
And we'll find them all in time
Girl, I know someday we'll even touch the sky
Just climb on the wings of my love

(Anytime) Anytime you want to leave your world behind
I'll take you high on the wings of my love
(Take my hand) Just take my hand and together we'll touch the sky
Just climb on the wings of my love
(Just remember) Just remember I will always be around
I'll take you high on the wings of my love

// Love Is Here And Now You're Gone //

Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now you're gone

You persuaded me to love you, and I did
But instead of tenderness, I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell, so unaware
Of the loneliness that was waiting there

You closed the door to your heart, girl
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me

Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And, oh, my darling, now you're gone

You said loving you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked, just walked away

You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then you took my hope
Look at me now

Look at me
See what loving you has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep

My heart cries out for your touch
But baby, you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now you're gone

You made me love you (Love, love is here)
Oh oh, my darling, now you're gone (And now you're gone)
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love, ooh, ooh (Love, love is here)
My darling, now you're gone (And now you're gone)

Talking 'bout love, love, love, love, ooh, ooh (Love, love is here)
My darling, now you're gone (And now you're gone)
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love, ooh, ooh (Love, love is here)
My baby, now you're gone (And now you're gone)

// You've Got A Friend //

When you're down and troubled
And you need some loving care
And nothing, no, nothing is going right
Just close your eyes and think of me
And soon I'll be there to brighten up
Yeah, even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know, wherever I am
I'll come a-running, yeah yeah
To see you again

Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will
You've got a friend, oh yeah
You've got a friend
You've got a friend, oh baby
You've got a friend

When the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind, yeah
He begins to blow
Here's what you do baby
You keep your head together, together baby
And call my name out loud
And you'll hear me knocking, knocking at your door
Oh yes I will, yes I will

You just call out my name
And you know, wherever I am
I'll come a-running, yeah, yeah
To see you again
Ooh

Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will

Ain't it good to know
That you got a friend
People can be so cold
They'll hurt you, yeah, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
But don't let them, no no no, don't let them
Hmm

Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you have to do is call and I'll be there
I'll be there, yes I will

Oh
You've got a friend, yes you do
You've got a friend, yes you do
Right 'til the end, right for you
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend, yes you do
You've got a friend, yes you do
Right 'til the end, right for you
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend, yes you do
You've got a friend, yes you do
Right 'til the end, right for you
Ain't it good to know
You've got a friend, yes you do
You've got a friend, yes you do
Right 'til the end, right for you
