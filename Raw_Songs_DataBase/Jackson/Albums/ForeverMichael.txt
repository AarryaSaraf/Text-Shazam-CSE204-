// We're Almost There //

No matter how hard
The task may seem
Don't give up our plans
Don't give up our dreams
No broken bridges
Can turn us around
'Cause what we're searching for
Will soon be found

'Cause we're al-almost there
Just one more step (Almost there)
Just one more step
Don't give up, we're al-almost there ('Cause we're almost there)

(Look at the lovers)
Look at the lonely lovers (That didn't make it)
That didn't make it (A long, hard climb)
Life's a long, hard climb
They just couldn't take it
Don't let it happen
To me and you
Hold on together, darling
We'll make it through
Darling, keep on reaching out for me
Keep on reaching
Do it for me, do it for me, 'cause baby

(We're almost there)
('Cause we're almost there)
('Cause we're almost there)

We're so close
I can taste it
A life so sweet
We can't afford to waste it
Need to feel your hand
Slipping from mine?
Just hold on tighter, darling
Keep on trying
Baby, do it for me (Let's make this climb)
Do it, do it, do it, baby

(We're almost there)
Just one more step
Don't give up (We're almost there)
Just one more step
Baby, baby, don't give up ('Cause we're almost there)
Keep on, keep on
Just one more step (We're almost there)
'Cause we're almost there

Just one more step
'Cause we're almost there
We've come too far
To turn around
Keep on reaching
For higher ground
We've had our ups
And we've had our downs
Ain't lettin' nothin' in the world, darling
Turn us around
'Cause we're almost there
We're almost there
We're almost there
Everything we're looking for
We're almost there
Keep on reaching out for me
'Cause we're almost there, darling
We're almost there
We're almost there, darling
We're almost there
We're almost there
Ah, we're almost there
Babe, we're almost there

// Take Me Back //

Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby
Ah take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby

I thought the grass was green on the other side
Thought the sun shone brighter without saying goodbye
There's a card in my hand
Tears fall like rain
I wanna come home again
I want you to

Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby
Ain't no love in this world
Ain't no love in this world without you

In my search to find myself
I saw your face and nothing else
Every place I go with everything I do
I still feel the need for you
Come on and

Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby

I am on my way back to you
And I wanna make it up to you
And all the problems that I caused you
If it takes my life I will make it up to you
I just want you to take me, take me
Take me, take me, take me, take me

Take me back, forgive me
Take me back where I belong
If you can, if you can find it
In your heart to forgive me

// One Day In Your Life //

One day in your life
You'll remember a place
Someone touching your face
You'll come back and you'll look around you

One day in your life
You'll remember the love you found here
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day 

One day in your life
When you find that you're always waiting
For the love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there

You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day 

One day in your life
When you find that you're always lonely
For the love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there

// Cinderella Stay Awhile //

Fairytale make believe in you
Fairytale make believe in you

Cinderella, stay awhile
You're the one
That I've been lookin' for
Cinderella, when you smile
All around me sunbeams
Start to fall

Midnight is so near
Please don't disappear
Now that you are here
Stay awhile

Cinderella, I just know
That the magic slipper's
Gonna fit
Cinderella, do not go
You're my princess
I am sure of it

This is love for sure
Love that's sweet and pure
Love that will endure
Stay awhile

When you speak the angels all sing
This is the kind of magic you bring, oh

Cinderella, stay awhile
This is like a fairytale with you
Cinderella, when you smile
All my fairy tales are coming true

Well my only fear
Is midnight is so near
Please don't disappear
Stay awhile, oh

(Fairy tales, make-believe and you)
(Fairy tales, make-believe and you)

Cinderella, stay awhile
Don't you go
Oh

// We've Got Forever //

(We've got forever, forever)

I'll plant you a garden
Of laughter and tears
With rain and with sunshine
Love will grow through the years
The dreams that we're dreaming
Have time to come true

'Cause we've got forever
And forever is meant for so very few

We shall have music
We shall have rhyme
We shall have each other
One minute after the end of time

Then we'll add up the pleasures
And treasure the sums
Caring is sharing
The cake and the crumbs
How lucky we are to be me and you

'Cause we've got forever
And forever is meant for so very few

(We got, we got, we got, we got it) Me and you, baby
(We got, we got, we got) (Forever and forever)
(We got, we got, we got, ooh)
(We got, we got, we got) We got a million tomorrows
(We got, we got, we got, we got it) Uh, yeah

(We got, we got, we got) (Forever and forever) Yeah
(We got, we got, we got, ooh) I know that we got it
(We got, we got, we got) I know that we got it
(We got, we got, we got, we got it) Ah

(We got, we got, we got) (Forever and forever) We've got, we've got, we've got
(We got, we got, we got, ooh) Got, got, yeah
(We got, we got, we got) Uh, yeah
(We got, we got, we got, we got it) Me and you, baby

(We got, we got, we got) (Forever and forever) Uh
(We got, we got, we got, ooh)
(We got, we got, we got) We got a million tomorrows
(We got, we got, we got, we got it)

(We got, we got, we got) (Forever and forever)
(We got, we got, we got, ooh)
(We got, we got, we got)

// Just A Little Bit Of You //

Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away

I told my mama how I feel about your power
Your love can heal, can't no doctor's remedy
Ever do what you do for me

Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Eeny weeny teeny bit of your love
Baby, it's all I need, it's all I need

Since the day I've been loving you
I can't catch a cold, I can't catch the flu
The sweet loving you've been giving me
Has become my daily need

Just a little o' your love, every day
It's all I need, that's all I need
Just a little bit, baby
That's all I need, that's all I need

So don't send no doctor to my door
'Cause Doctor John has been here before
Don't you send him, just come yourself
Bring your loving and nothing else

Ooh just a, just a, 
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away

// You Are There //

You are there like the laughter of a child
When I need just a smile
Suddenly the sun shines for a while

Everywhere sounds of love are everywhere
And my heart sings along
Thanks to you I finally got a song

'Cause you are there
You are there
You are there somewhere
Each time my world seems like it's falling down
Things look up just having you around
So every night I say a prayer
Just because you're there

Like a rainbow after rain
Like the night follows day
You're the answer to the prayers I say

And you are there
You are there
You are there somewhere
No matter where I go or what I do
You are there to help me see it through
So every night I say a prayer
Just because you're there

Ooh, you are there
Ooh, you are there, somewhere
And as the years go by we'll stay as true
What you are for me I'll be for you
And every night I'll say a prayer
Just because you're there

Ooh, you are there
Ooh, you are there
Everywhere, you are there

// Dear Michael //

She wrote: "Dear Michael
You'll probably never get this letter, Michael
I wrote you a hundred times before
Knowing how I feel, I'll write a hundred more"

"Dear Michael (Michael, Michael)
Every time (She wrote) your record's on, Michael (Michael, Michael)
I close my eyes (She wrote) and sing along
Dreaming you're singing to me"

And then, she wrote: "Michael, I love you
I've held the tears back long as I can
I'm sealing my feelings in this envelope
'Cause I wanna be more than just your number one fan"

I'm gonna answer your letter (Michael, Michael)
I'll start beginning (She wrote) with the ABC's of loving you (Michael, Michael)
Your letter (She wrote) really touched my heart
I've been dreaming of
Meeting the picture that you sent along
Signed with all your love

(Michael, Michael)
(I wrote you)
(She wrote)
I'm gonna write you back, ooh
I promise you that

Girl, I think I love you
(Michael, Michael) (I wrote you, she wrote)
Hurry, hurry, mister postman (Won't you write me back?)
(Please write me back) Take my letter, tell her I love her
(Michael, Michael) (I wrote you, she wrote)
Hurry, hurry mister postman (Won't you write me back?)
(Please write me back) Take my letter, tell her I love her
(Michael, Michael) Yeah

I'm gonna write you back
I promise you that
Tell her I love her

(Ouch)

// I'll Come Home To You //

If I had my way, girl
I'd never leave you for a minute
But things don't always turn out
The way we want 'em to
So, while I'm away, now
I want you to remember
How much I love you
I love you, I love you

Let this love lift you up
When you're feeling blue
Wherever I go, I will be loving you
Think of me when you see
Places we once shared
Whatever I do, someday I'll need you there
Ooh

Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you

Even though we both know
You're not in my arms
Wherever I go, you're always in my heart
Ooh, just you ask, I'll come back
Though we're miles apart
Whatever I do, I'll come to where you are
Oh

Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you

Oh, wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you
Don't you worry, darling

Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you
Don't you worry, baby

Wherever I go, whatever I do
