We're on a mission in the everlastin' light that shines
A revelation of the truth in chapters of our minds

(So long, bad times)
We're gonna shake it up and break it up
We're sharin' a light brighter than the sun
(Hello, good times)
We're here to simulate, eliminate
And congregate, illuminate

(We are here to change the world) Hee!
Gonna change the world, hee!
(We are here to change the world)
Gonna change the world, ooh!

So do surrender 'cause the power is deep inside my soul
Ah, sing it

(We are here to change the world) Hee!
Gonna change the world, baby
(We are here to change the world) Hee!
Gonna change the world, ooh!

Ooh! (We are here to change the world)
We're gonna change the world, girl
(We are here to change the world)
My brothers, my brother, baby
We're gonna change the world
(We are here to change the world) Hee!
Deep down in my body
Deep down in my soul, baby
(We are here to change the world) Hee!
Gonna change the world
Ooh!
