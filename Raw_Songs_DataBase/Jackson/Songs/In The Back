You're just preaching the Bible
And they still speaking "You're a liar"
And you still deal with the fires
That they make get bigger
Dah dah dah dah dah dah

Dah dah dah dah dah dah, and you
Dah dah dah dah dah dah, dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah

Why you wanna get me?
Dreams don't last forever, oh
Why you wanna fix me?
See, if the police don't take it
God forsake it
I can't take it

Why you stab me in the back?

We're so gonna lose it
And she, knows that is the deal
She, I
Dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah dah dah

Dah dah dah dah, people
Dah dah dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah dah dah, did I
Dah dah dah dah

Why you wanna get me?
This dude won't last forever
Why you wanna hit me?
Oh, babe
If the police don't take it
God forsake it
I'll fall breaking

Why you stab me in the back?

Why you wanna fix me?
Things don't last forever, oh no
Why you wanna get me?
We should be together
Why you wanna hit me?
We should be together
Why you wanna get me?
See, if the police don't take it
God forsake it
I won't take it

Why you stab me in the back?

Ow!
