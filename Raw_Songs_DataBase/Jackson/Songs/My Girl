I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

I've got so much honey the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Ooh

I love my baby
She makes me feel proud
I'll climb the highest mountain
And say it aloud

I don't need no money, fortune, or fame
I've got all the riches baby one man can claim
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (talking my girl)

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
With my girl
I've even got the month of May
With my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)
Oh, yeah, my girl (my girl)
Ooh, my girl (my girl)
That'a all that I can talk about
It's my girl
Yeah, yeah, my girl
