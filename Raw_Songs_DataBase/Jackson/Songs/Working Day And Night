No, no, ooh, oh

You got me workin' day and night
Ooh my sugar

Scratch my shoulder
It's aching, make it feel alright

Lovin' you will be so right

Will be tonight
But what is love girl
If I'm always out of sight (ooh)

You got me workin' day and night
And I'll be workin'
From sun up to midnight

You got me workin', workin' day and night
You got me workin', workin' day and night
You got me workin', workin' day and night

Is what a man's supposed to do
And I say it ain't right
If I can't give sweet love to you (Yeah)

Of what my life's supposed to be (well)
Soon enough darlin'
This love will be reality (ah ah)

How can you live girl
'Cause love for us was meant to be (well)
Then you must be seein'
Some other guy instead of me (ooh)

You got me workin' day and night
And I'll be workin'
From sun up to midnight

You got me workin', workin' day and night (hold on)
You got me workin', workin' day and night
