I woke up yesterday
Knowing I was lost in the past somewhere
I felt my destiny was a sad parade
Going nowhere

When I saw my sweet Melodie
Like a song, you enchanted me
And the sound of your voice
Made my heart keep time
To the music of the love that filled my mind

Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only

Doo-doo-oo doo-oo dooo-doo ooo-ooo
(I wanna see you love me)

The long and winding road
Is much shorter now that you're here with me
The questions in my mind
Have been answered now that you've told me
All the colours are brighter now
And the darkness is lighter now
In my mind I can hear
The band start to play
Hello tomorrow
Goodbye yesterday

Melodie, you're my symphony
A love song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only

Beautiful morning
Oh happy day
And you know that it's music to my ears
Every word that you say

Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only

Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only, only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only
