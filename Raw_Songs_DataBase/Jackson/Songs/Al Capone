Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Screamed in my face then pulled you back
She should have spied down his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away?

Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone who's in it
So sad, regret it
'Cause a madman's out tonight

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Screamed in my face then pulled you back
She should have spied down his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away?

Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone who's in it
So sad, regret it
And I told her, out tonight

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

Aaow!
Aaow!

Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone who's in it
So sad, regret it
'Cause a man is out tonight

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No-one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her (Should have told her)
Nobody ever showed her about us (Oh, ba-da)
No-one's sleepin' (No-one's lovin')
Nobody should be grievin' this way (Oh-ba-ba)

You should have told her (Should have told her)
Nobody ever showed her about us (Oh, ba-da)
No-one's sleepin' (No-one's love)
Nobody should be grievin' this way (Aaow!)

Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Screamed in my face then pulled you back
She should have spied down his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away? (Aaow!)
Doo-doo-do-do-doo
Hee-hee-hee-hee! (Hoo!)
