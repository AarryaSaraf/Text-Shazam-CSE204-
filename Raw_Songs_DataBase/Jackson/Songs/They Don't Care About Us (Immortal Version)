All the injustice

Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suite, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
Jew me, sue me, everybody do me
Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us (Hoo, hoo)
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us (Hoo, hoo)
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Some things in life they just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was living
He wouldn't let this be, no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
They don't care about us
They don't care about us (Hoo, hoo)
They don't care about us (Hoo, hoo)
They don't care about us (We're deep in the fire)
They don't care about us
They don't care about us (We're deep in the fire)
They don't care about us
They don't care about us (I came to remind you, hee)
They don't care about us (Don't you sit back, watch, debate it)
They don't care about us (Hoo, hoo)
They don't care about us (Hoo, hoo)
They don't care about us (Hee, hee, hee)
They don't care about us (They don't really care about us)
They don't care about us
They don't care about us (They don't really care about us)
They don't care about us

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
