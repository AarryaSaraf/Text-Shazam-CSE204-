Are you ready for a real good time?
Are you ready for a real good treat?
There'll be so much dancing, singing
Are you the girl, meant to me

So don't be messing around, don't be messing around (With me)
Don't be messing around (With me) hey hey hey
So don't be messing around, don't be messing around (With me)
Don't be messing around (With me) hey

If I started now in the deep
Think you said this feeling is your life
I'll be so proud if you let me love you girl
Let me love you for a little while

Don't be messing around, don't be messing around
Don't be messing around (With me) hey hey hey
So don't be messing around, don't be messing around
Don't be messing around (With me) hey
Oho yeah yeah
Oho yeah, oho yeah, oho yeah

Now she started finger-popping to the beat
So I said, "Let's get right on the floor."
She said to keep your mind on dancing
Won't be no romancing
No, no, don't mess around with me
I ain't playing

Don't be messing around, don't be messing around (with me)
Don't be messing around (With me) hey hey hey
So don't be messing around, don't be messing around (with me)
Don't be messing around (With me) hey hey
Bridge!
