To make my father proud
To make my mother smile
I need not conquer worlds, or fame
Nor set the pace for style
If I can follow through
On what they gave me as my tools
I'll find a way to sail my course
Avoiding ships of fools

If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart
I've done all to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me myself
So he can do the rest

War without compromise
Shall follow the feel of constant care

In my eleventh hour
I'll be a man aware
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared and unashamed
To just be called a part of God
For which I have been named
A man and woman's youngest son
While growing still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile
