I'm tired of injustice, I'm tired of the schemes
Your lies are disgusting
So what does it mean, damn it
Kickin' me down, I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damn it


Peek in the shadow, come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're selling out souls, but I, I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight


With such confusion
Don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize)
{Somebody please have mercy}
{'Cause I just can't take it}

{Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me}
{Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream}
{Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me}
{Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream}
You just, you just


I'm tired of you tellin' (Tellin')
The story your way (Story your way)
You're causin' confusion (Confusion)
You think it's okay, damn it
(You keep changin' the rules)
(While I, I keep playing the game)
(I can't take it much longer)
(I think I might go insane)
Ah, baby


With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(You find your pleasure scandalizing every lie)
{Oh Father, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it}


Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop fuckin' with me, make me wanna scream

"A man has been brutally beaten to death by police after being wrongly identified as a robbery suspect. The man was an 18-year-old black male..."


Oh my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned on the TV
This evening, I was disgusted by all the injustice
All the injustice (All the injustice)
Yeah, yeah
(Baby) Whoa


With such collusions, don't it make you wanna scream? (Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme (Make you wanna scream)
(You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize)
{Oh brother, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it}


Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
