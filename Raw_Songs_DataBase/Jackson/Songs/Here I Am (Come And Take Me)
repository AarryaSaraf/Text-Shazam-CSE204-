I can't believe that it's real
The way that you made me feel
A burning deep down inside
(A burning deep inside)
A love that I cannot hide

I know it's you honey baby, yeah
(I know it's you honey baby)
That makes the world go 'round
And it's keeping me here loving you, baby
Laying all my troubles down

Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby, come and take me
Take me by the hand, baby
Oh, show me, here I am, baby

Oh, it always ends up this way
(This way, this way, this way)
Me begging you every day
From love that I cannot hide
(From love that I can't hide)
You broke my heart into half

I know it's you and me baby, yeah
(I know it's you and me, baby)
That makes the world go 'round
Keeping me here loving you, baby
Laying all my troubles down

Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby, oh, come and take me

Ooh, come and take me, oh
Ooh
Here I am, baby, baby, come and take me, ooh-hoo
Here I am, baby, come and take me
Here I am, baby
Here I am, baby, come and take me
