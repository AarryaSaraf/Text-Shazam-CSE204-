We trippy, mane
It's your boy Juicy J, mane
Y'all can't fuck with Meg, man, y'all can't fuck with her
Here, hit this weed
Hit this weed, my nigga
'Cause you need to calm the fuck down
That shit'll kill you
Ayy, man, but look, man, check this out
From 2021 to 2022 to beyond
All we finna do is get more bags on top of more bags
Meg got businesses she openin'
Popeyes done cut her a crazy check, that shit stupid
So I'm tellin' y'all, man
Verse killer music, her label comin' out
Man, shout out to my nigga T Farris, Lil Ju, the whole team, man
Let's get it, man, look here
I'ma hit this weed one more time
Bitch, smoke this
Y'all need to keep smokin' weed
Shut the fuck up
