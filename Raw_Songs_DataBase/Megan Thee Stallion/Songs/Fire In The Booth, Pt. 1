Ay, ay
Okay, runnin' up them bands, tryna ball till I fall
Runnin' from his bitch, he gon' come when I call
If it ain't 'bout money, then you know I ain't involved
Worry 'bout these motherfuckin haters, not at all
Nine times outta ten, I'm the realest bitch you know
If you ain't want to pimp, then what you fuckin' with me for?
If you ballin' and you know it, then let the money show
If he actin' scared to spend it, I'ma show him to the door
Okay, now shake with it
Shake the shake with it
And if the beat live, you know Lil Duke made it
And when I pop it he get stiffer than some fake titties
And don't be worried 'bout who I'm fuckin' 'cause you can't hit it

Ay, runnin' up them bands, tryna ball till I fall
If I'm with your daddy, then you know we at the mall
If I'm with a nigga, then you know I'm in them drawers
How you let a broke nigga talk you out the drawers
I don't even chase liquor
Why would I chase a nigga?
He say I should be nicer
Boy, your dick should be bigger
He said, "It better be good
By the way that you're braggin'"
I hit him back and told him, "Well
That just depend who you askin'"
I got a ex that say he gon' leave his new bitch whenever I call him
Got a ex that say that every time he see me it's gon' be problems
Got a ex text on his homeboy IG tryna stalk me now
Got a ex that miss me so much, prolly prayin' for me now

Ay, runnin' up them bands, tryna ball till I fall
Hittin' the Gucci store, finna tear that bitch down
Money on my phone, yeah, like collect-calls
Pussy like a drug, he be havin' withdrawals
Money, money, I need more
Get it, get it, watch me go
I be outdoin' these bitches
I'm like Michael, they Tito
Not the one to compete with
You don't want it with me, bitch
Got too big, you can't save you
When I come for you hairdo
Got the moves like I'm Ryu
Yellow diamonds, Pikachu
When I switch my hair to blonde
I'm finna turn up like Goku
I go crazy in this bitch
I go crazy in the booth
He go crazy when he see me
And his girl go crazy too
And this pussy so wet, might have to eat it with a spoon
I was in bikini bottoms 'cause I got that blue lagoon
I don't wanna fuck him if he tellin' me what he do not
I will come over and spin it on your head like bantu knots

Ay, runnin' up them bands, tryna ball till I fall
Bitch, I'm off the Hen', so you know I'm off the wall
Bitch, I'm not the one, so watch your motherfuckin' mouth
Hot girl Meg from the motherfuckin' South, ah

Bitch I look gooder than a motherfucka
I be with niggas that's hooder than a motherfucka
We will come right in this bitch and then tear it up
I'm from a city where niggas ain't sharin' nothin'
I had to figure shit out on my own
Momma at work and my daddy ain't home
Don't listen to shit because, bitch, I been grown
I got a temper, so, hoe, watch your tone
He tryna dog me, but I got the bone
Don't got the money? Don't pick up the phone!
He can talk down, he can say what he want
He was just mad he didn't get what he want
Hoes love to try 'cause they think that I won't
Bitch, I will run through your shit like a cone
Bitch, I ain't mad, I get what I want
I'm lookin' for somebody to take it out on
You wanna talk or you wanna get to it?
'Cause when it come down to who 'bout it I'm fluent
Bitch, you was hatin' on me and I knew it
A hoe wanna give me some beef, I chew it
Givin' these rappers the business, I'm suited
These bitches look better to me when they muted
Tellin' these niggas that you got that water
But you ain't gon' tell 'em your shit is polluted, ughh

Real Hot Girl shit
Real H-Town shit
Real Texas shit
