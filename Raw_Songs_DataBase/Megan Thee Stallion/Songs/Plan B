Who the fuck you think you talking to, nigga?
Fuck me? Nah, nigga, fuck you, nigga

Dear fuck nigga, still can't believe I used to fuck with' ya
Poppin' Plan B's 'cause I ain't planned to be stuck with' ya
Damn, I see you still kick it with them opp bitches (Opp bitches)
I'm the only reason that your goofy ass got bitches
All them hoes wanna look like me (Look like me)
Bitch most likely only fuckin' you just to spite me (Ayy, ayy, just to spite me)
So please don't get it twisted, I ain't trippin'
I never put my faith in a nigga, bitch, I'ma die independent (Ayy, ayy, woah, woah, woah)
If you was wonderin', yeah, boy, I'm still that bitch (Still that bitch)
I had to block you but you still gotta watch this shit (Hmm)
'Cause who the fuck rock it like me? No bra, tight tee (Hey)
Slick back ponytail, feelin' like I'm Ice-T (Ah)
You know I suck it good, real hood, when you wake up (Real hood, when you wake up)
You know her head weak if she ain't fuckin' up her makeup
Damn, I can't believe I used to let you fuck me (Let you fuck me)
I'd rather be in jail before a broke nigga cuff me (Ayy, ayy)

Ladies, love yourself, 'cause this shit could get ugly (Shit could get ugly)
That's why it's, "Fuck niggas, get money!" (Fuck niggas, get money)
And I don't give a fuck if that nigga leave tonight, because, nigga, that dick don't run me (Ayy)
You better get on your knees and eat this pussy right before I have another nigga do it for me
Because dick don't run me, I run dick, nigga, yeah, you's a bitch

Mugler suit in my meeting, wagyu steak what I'm eating (Ah)
Makin' so much money, this nigga dumb if he's cheatin' (Dumb if he's cheatin')
Bitches watchin' and hatin', put that shit in they faces (In they faces)
I buy the whole buildin', and keep the hoes in they places
He submerged in it (Yeah), like a baptism (Like a baptism)
He hit this water, then he comin' back a real nigga (Ah)
How you want a bitch (Yeah), but don't wanna work? (But don't wanna work)
How you want a bitch that you don't deserve?
I should have listened to my first mine
And told your ass "No" the first time
Tried to spare this nigga feelings now he think he hurt mine
He cheat, and I be at work while you sleep
My pussy is the most expensive thing you'll ever eat
Fuck you, still can't believe I used trust you
The only accolade you ever made is that I fucked you
You a bitch, if you get the chance I bet you snitch
You'll never get a chance to tell me "Come and pay my shit"

Ladies, love yourself, 'cause this shit could get ugly (Shit could get ugly)
That's why it's, "Fuck niggas, get money!" (Fuck niggas, get money)
And I don't give a fuck if that nigga leave tonight, because, nigga, that dick don't run me (Ayy)
You better get on your knees and eat this pussy right, before I have another nigga do it for me
Because dick don't run me, I run dick, nigga, yeah, you's a bitch
(You's a bitch, you's a bitch)
