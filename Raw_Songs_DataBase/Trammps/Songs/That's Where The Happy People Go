I used to spend most of my time
Just being alone, yes, I did
Nothing to do, no place to go
Just stayed at home

So I put my blues upon the shelf
And I made up my mind
To live a little myself
So I went on down to a disco

Disco, that's where
The happy people go
(Happy people go)
And they're just dancing along
To a perfect song at the disco

Disco, that's where
The happy people go
And they're just dancing along
To a perfect song at the disco

Now listen, all my friends
They wonder what's come over me
They all say I'm not the
Same old guy I used to be, yeah

First of all, I got myself together
I danced my blues away
They're gone forever
Then I ease on down to the disco

Disco, that's where
The happy people go
(Happy people go)
And they're just dancing along
To a perfect song at the disco

Clap your hands
Just stomp your feet, alright
Get on down, get on down
Just get on down

Sing the song, children
Boogie, boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie

Oh, yeah
Keep on, keep on
Keep on

Disco, that's where
The happy people go
And they're just dancing along
To a perfect song at the disco
