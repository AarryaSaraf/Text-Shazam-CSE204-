Stop and think a while before you leave and say goodbye
You know you'd better stop
Stop it baby
Stop and think a while before you leave and say goodbye

You know you'd better
If you leave I know my life will never be the same
One more chance that's all I ask
My heart is full of shame

Let me explain
Ooh, I fooled around and took the chance on a one night fling
You caught me wrong
I promise you girl I'll try my best to do the right thing

Stop and think a while before you leave and say goodbye
You know you'd better stop
Stop it baby
Stop and think a while before you leave and say goodbye

Wait a minute now
There's one thing I'd like to say if you have the time
I'll confess the wrong I've done
If you say you're mine

Let me explain
Ooh, I fooled around and took the chance on a one night fling
Honey
You caught me wrong
I promise you girl, I'll try my best to do the right thing

Stop and think a while before you leave and say goodbye
You know you'd better
Stop and think a while before you leave and say goodbye
You know you'd better
Stop...
