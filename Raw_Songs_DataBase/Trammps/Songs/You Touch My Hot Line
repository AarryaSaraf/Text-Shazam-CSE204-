I was a cold, cold man
Well, well, then you came along and made me understand
Oh, I had the real outlook on life
You took me out on the town
And you made it, oh, you made it work out right

Oh, you touch me (Touch me)
Oh, you touch me, oh no

You touch my hot line when you dance so fine
You touch my hot line 'cause you really got down
You touch my hot line 'cause you dance so fine
You touch my hot line, and now, and now, ow

Your warm and tender body in my arm
Well, yeah, the thrill and the chills of your charms, well
Oh, you spark the flame
That made this iceberg melt
You warm my body
Oh, you showed me, oh, you girl, you're something else

Oh, you touch me (Touch me)
Oh, you touch me, oh no
You touch my hot line when you dance so fine
You touch my hot line when you really got down
You touch my hot line 'cause you're mine, all mine
You touch my hot line, and now, and now
You touch my hot line

Oh, I had the real outlook on life
You took me out on the town
And you showed me, oh, you really got down

Oh, you touch me (Touch me)
Oh, you touch me, oh no
You touch my hot line when you really got down
You touch my hot line 'cause you're mine, all mine
You touch my hot line 'cause you dance so fine
You touch my hot line 'cause you're mine, all mine
And now, and now, ow

You touch my hot line when you really got down
You touch my hot line 'cause you're mine, all mine
You touch my hot line 'cause you dance so fine
You touch my hot line 'cause you're mine, all mine (Ow, ow, ow)
You touch my hot line

Ooh, well, well, get on down (Hey, baby, girl, you dig)
Shake it (Baby baby, baby baby, baby)
Love the way you move, hmm (Baby baby, baby baby, baby)
Love the way you groove (Baby baby, baby baby, baby)
You dance so fine, mmm (Baby)
You're mine, all mine (Said you're mine, all mine)
Oh, your warm, tender body (Tender body)
Turns me on, yes, it does
Turnin', turnin' me upside down
Oh

(You touch me) Hot line when you really got down (Yes, you did)
You touch my hot line 'cause you're mine, all mine (You did it, baby)
You touch my hot line 'cause you dance so fine (You did it, baby)
You touch my hot line, 'cause you're mine, all mine (You did it)

You touch my hot line when you really got down (Yes, you did)
You touch my hot line 'cause you're mine, all mine (The way you touch me, ah)
(Move, move so fine, yeah, yeah)
You touch my hot line 'cause you dance so fine (You touch my hot line)
(Hot line, baby)
You touch my hot line
