Each night I go to sleep
With nothing but your memory
Sweet thoughts come into view
All I see is your sweet body

Well, well, well, well yeah (sometimes I can, I can hear your breathin')
(Something in the night)
Seems so real to me
(But that's just my mind playing tricks on me)
But life alone is my destiny (shoopadoo)

Yeah (I feel like I've been living)
I've been living
(On the dark side of the moon)
I don't wanna live alone
(It feels like I've been living)
No!
(On the dark side of the moon)
Well, yeah yeah!

Another thing I wanna say

If I, if I had known
Your life so far will be forever
I'd know, I'd change my ways
To keep you here
Till the last thin' ever, well

(Sometimes I can, I can see you walking)
I can see you walking
(Just ahead of me ahead of me)
Ahead of me
(But that's just my mind playing tricks on me)
But life alone is my destiny (shoopadoo)

Yeah (I feel like I've been living)
I've been living
(On the dark side of the moon)
I don't wanna live alone
(It feels like I've been living)
No!
(On the dark side of the moon)
Oh, baby!

(I feel like I've been living)
I've been living
(On the dark side of the moon)
I don't wanna live alone, no
(It feels like I've been living)
Sometimes I think
(On the dark side of the moon)
I can hear you breathin'
(I feel like I've been living)
But I know it's just my heart, yeah
(On the dark side of the moon)
Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby
(It feels like I've been living)
I don't wanna live no, no
(On the dark side of the moon)

I wish to soul and heart (I feel like I've been living)
(On the dark side of the moon) you'll set me free
I don't want to live (it feels like I've been living)
I don't want to live I don't want to live alone
(On the dark side of the moon)
Feels like I'm on the dark side
Of the moon, yeah

Sometimes I feel
I can hear you breathin'
But I know, but I know, but I know
It's just a dream
Come on hon, oh
I don't wanna live alone, no
It's no fun being alone
I don't wanna live alone
I'm so tired of being alone, say it
I've been living
I don't wanna live

(It feels like I've been living)
(On the dark side of the moon)
...

(It feels like I've been living)
(On the dark side of the moon)
I don't wanna live alone, no

(It feels like I've been living)
Sometimes I think
(On the dark side of the moon)
I can hear you breathin'
(It feels like I've been living)
But I know it's just my heart, yeah
(On the dark side of the moon)

Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby (it feels like I've been living)
I don't wanna live no no (on the dark side of the moon)

I wish to soul and heart (it feels like I've been living)
(On the dark side of the moon) you'll set me free
I don't want to live (it feels like I've been living)
I don't want to live I don't want to live alone
(On the dark side of the moon)
