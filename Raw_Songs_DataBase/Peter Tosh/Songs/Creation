(Lord of Lords, hallelujah)
(King of Kings, hallelujah)
(Lord of Lords, hallelujah)

In the beginning was the Word
And the Word was with Jah
And the Word was Jah

In the beginning Jah created the heaven and the earth
Then he created man of his own likeness and image
Gave unto man wisdom, knowledge, overstanding

Jah is my life and my strength
So whom shall I fear
He is a shield upon my right and my left hand
Jah is my keeper

Jah is my light and my salvation
So whom shall I fear
He is my guide throughout this Creation
So whom shall I be afraid
Jah is my keeper

Jah is my guide
In my resting and my rising
So whom shall I fear
He is my guide when I step out and forward
So whom shall I be afraid
Jah is my keeper

Jah is my guide
When Philistines come down upon I
So whom shall I fear
He is my guide when my enemies come to devour I
So whom shall I be afraid
Jah is my keeper

Jah is my guide
From the pestilence of darkness
So whom shall I fear
He is my guide from the vampires of hell
So whom shall I be afraid
Jah is my keeper

Jah is my health and my strength
So whom shall I fear
He is a shield upon my right and my left hand
So whom shall I be afraid
Jah is my keeper
