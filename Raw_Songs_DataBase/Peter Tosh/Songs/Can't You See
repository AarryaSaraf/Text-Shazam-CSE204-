Told me you loved me
Right from the start
Don't play no tricks
Don't break my heart

Told me you loved me
And I said why
You think I'm gonna cry


Can't you see
What you're doing to me
I am bound
You've got to set me free

You jerk on my heart
Shatter my brain
If you have conscience
Ain't that a shame

Told me you loved me
To make my cry
And I said I don't know why



Then if you love me
Don't treat me so bad
I could give you something you never had

See you sitting up there
And you're looking so mad
Your imagination is making you sad
