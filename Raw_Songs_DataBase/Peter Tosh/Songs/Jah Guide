Here though I trod through this valley
I will fear no evil

'Cause I know
Jah Guide 
Jah Guide  I through this valley
And I know he will
When I'm trodding through this valley
I know he will


Though my enemies fight me everyday
I will fear no evil
Though my enemies set traps in my way
Still I will fear no evil



Many petty workers dig pits every day
But I don't fear no evil
Out-a-quity workers fight me everyday
Still I will fear no evil



Pestilence lurks in dark places
And I fear no evil
Destruction walk with smiling faces
Still I will fear no evil



When I'm walking the streets
I know he will (Precedes each line below)
When I'm smoking my pipe
When I'm troddin' the earth
When I'm driving the road
When they dig pits in my way
When they try to keep me down
