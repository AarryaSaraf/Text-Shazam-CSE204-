First you came and you sold us Christianity
But all your members just lust after vanity
Telling them to trust in you faithfully
Not seeing it's the return of the slavery
Taught us of heaven way up in the sky
Where we can't reach unless we die
But you can't fool me again
You can't fool me again and again
You can't fool me again
You just can't fool me, no you can't fool me

Of things you taught me in school
There's so much to make me a fool
But if I was a mule
I know I'd be used as a tool
I said that, you can't fool me again
You can't fool me again, and again
You can't fool me again
You just can't fool me, you can't fool me
You draw and object on piece of a paper
Said I'm to serve it as lord and as savior
Tell me of a heaven way up in the sky
Where I can't reach unless I die
You can't fool me again
I said you can't fool me, you can't fool me
You can't fool me again
You just can't fool me, no you can't fool me

You said Humpty sat up on a wall
You say Humpty, he had a fall
You said that cow, jump over moon
And the dish ran away with the spoon
But I know you can't fool me again
You can't...
