This song sayin lion iron but you cant go to zion see for example there are lots of guys who were dreadlocks who is one million miles away from rasta there are like night to day.
See and I know concept of rasta mean righteousness.
You talkin' about lion, iron, but you can't go to zion
Talkin' about lion, iron, but you far from zion
I only hear you words
But I don't see no works
You think my father's a fool
You never get away
No matter what you say
Cause you have broken my father's rule
And then you come around, lion, iron, but you can't go to zion
Talkin' 'bout lion, iron, but you far from zion
Knots on your head
Talkin' 'bout you dread
And you believe, that is all
Long hair on your face
And your works is disgrace
You and the wicked them must fall
And then you talk about lion, iron, but you can't go to zion
Talkin' 'bout lion, iron, but you far from zion
Preach lot in the days
And you kill in the nights
And you believe, that is right
Put down your gun
Or your days will be done
You won't be around, to have no fun
So I am the lion, iron, and I must go to zion
I am the lion, iron, and I must go to zion
I am the lion, iron, and I must go to zion
Cause I am the lion, iron, and I must go to zion
No bet you, lion, iron, and I must go to zion
I am the lion, iron, and I must go to zion
Cause I am the lion, iron, and I must go to zion
No bet you, lion, iron
Dress back baldhead bwai
Step back likkle pick out tail bwai, me is a big bwai out dere
