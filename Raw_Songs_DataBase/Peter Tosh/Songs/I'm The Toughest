Anything you can do
I can do it better
I'm the toughest 
And I can do what you can't do
You'll never try to do what I do
I'm the toughest 

Stop from doing wrongs
Change your foolish plans
Stop from doing wrongs
Just live up like a man

I'm the toughest 
I'm the toughest 


Now my little brothers
You've got to be good
Do what's right
Don't be bad-minded
Just take what's yours
And there'll be no fuss or fight



Stop from doing wrongs
Change your foolish plan
Stop from doing wrongs
Just live up like a man

I'm the toughest 
I'm the toughest 


Now my brothers
You've got to be good
Just do what you know is right
Don't be bad minded
Just take what's yours
And there'll be no fuss or fight



I said I love my brothers
I said I love my sisters
I don't covet my neighbour
And I love my neighbour
