Due to unfavorable financial condition
I am unable to cope with this financial situation
That is causing inflation upon creation

I can't stand this no longer
The wicked get stronger
I can't stand this no longer
'Cause the battle is getting hotter


But them ha fe get a beatin'
The wicked ha fe get a beatin'
Them must get a beatin'
The wicked ha fe get a beatin'

Now that you waited
'Til you back is against the wall
One step to progess my brother
And I know Jah will help you all



I can't stand this no longer
The wicked get stronger
I can't stand this no longer
'Cause even cockroach get nuffer



Tell me how long
Must the good suffer for the bad
And every time the good open his mouth
The bad say "You must be mad!"



I can't stand this no longer

Now that you waited so long
'Til you back is against the wall
If you make one step to progress
I know Jah will help you all



I can't stand this no longer
The wicked get so strong
I can't stand this no longer
Everything seem to be wrong
