Gotta find a solution to this pollution 
The poor man a feel it 

Gas gone up
Bus fare gone up
The rent gone up
For meal gone up?
Lighting gone up
The tax gone up
Car parts gone up
And mi can't take the first law



Only him feel it - yeah

Time gone up
Scallion gone up
Onion gone up
Red beans gone up
Black pepper gone up
Chicken gone up
And the parents them angry
Cause the pickney them hungry
