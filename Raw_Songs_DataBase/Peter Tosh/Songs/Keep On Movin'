Wo-o-oo-er.
Push on through!
Wo-o-o!
Lord, I got to keep on movin'
Lord, I got to get on down
Lord, I've got to keep on groovin'
Where I can't be (found)
Where I can't be found
Lord, they gunning after me.

I've been accused on my mission
(shoob-shoo-be-doob)
Jah knows they shouldn't do it
(shoob-shoo-be-doob)
For hanging me they were willing, yeah, yeah, yeah!
(shoob-shoo-be-doob)
And that's why I've got to get on through (ooh-ooh!)
Lord, they comin' after me.

Lord, I got to keep on movin'
Lord, I got to get on down
Lord, I got to keep on groovin'
Where I can't be found
Lord, they gunning after me.

I've got two boys and a woman
(shoob-shoo-be-doob)
And I know they won't suffer now
(shoob-shoo-be-doob)
Jah, forgive me for not going back,
But I'll be there anyhow
Yes, I'll be there anyhow.

Lord, I got to keep on movin'
Lord, I got to get on down
Lord, I got to keep on groovin'
Where I can't be found
Lord, they gunning after me.

Tell Ziggy, I'm fine
And to keep the dollar in line,
'Cause we're soon to move now, we are
Tell Anthy, I'm fine
And to keep daughter in line
We gonna have one six-day show, a war.

Lord, I got to keep on movin'
Lord, I got to get on down
Lord, I got to keep on groovin'
Where I can't be found
Lord, they gunning after me.

Lord, I got to keep on movin'
Lord, got to get on down
Lord, got to keep on groovin'
Where I can't be found
Lord, they gunning after me.

They coming on another ridge
(shoob-shoo-be-doob)
They coming on another bridge
(shoob-shoo-be-doob)
They coming on a Ziggy-Ziggy bridge
(shoob-shoo-be-doob)
They coming on another bridge
(shoob-shoob-shoo-be-doob)
Another Ziggy-Ziggy-Ziggy bridge
(shoob-shoo-be-doob)
I'll send you a check through the post,
Though you did not get the first
(aah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'll send another to quench your thirst
The war will soon be over
(aah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
And Africa will unite
The children who livest in darkness
(aah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Have seen the great light!

Lord, I got to keep on movin'
Lord, I gotta get on down
Lord, I gotta keep on movin'
Where I can't be found
