Mash it up now
That's exactly what we gonna do
Make it good, make it good, sugar
Nothing but love

You are so beautiful
You are so wonderful
And you can make your dreams
Make them come true

You get through everything
And cast a laugh and sing
You can do anything
That you want to, yeah

You bring the sunshine when it's dark
With nothing but love, sweet love
And make me smile and say it's fine
When I haven't got a dime, love, true love

And when things are going wrong
We can fix it with a song
I know we can now, really, really can now
We gonna do it, nothing but love

You don't need expensive furs
You don't need no diamonds and pearls
You don't need that Witchcraft world
To make your dreams come true

You don't need no Cadillac car
You don't have to be a movie star
Just work on what you are
And I know that you'll make it through

You bring the sunshine when it's dark
With nothing but love, true love
Make me smile and say it's fine
When I haven't got a dime, love, true love

And when things are going wrong
We can fix it with a song, song
It's alright, they gonna like it
Nothing but love

You make it alright
You make it alright
You make it alright
You make it alright

You bring the sunshine when it's dark
With nothing but love, sweet love
Make me smile and say it's fine
When I haven't got a dime, love, true love

And when things are going wrong
We can fix it with a song, song
It's aright, we gotta keep it that way
I know, I know, I know I know you were so right
Nothing but love

So right, so right, babe
You make it alright
Need to feel me deep down now
I'm feeling airy, airy

You are the essence of
Everything I love, oh baby oh baby
You make it alright

It's a positive vibration
Going in circulation, yeah
We gonna give it to the nation
Through this evaporation, you make it alright

You make it alright
I feel it deep, deep down inside
You make it alright
You make it alright
Can you feel it, feel it?
