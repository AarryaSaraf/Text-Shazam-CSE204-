Africa has got to be free


Fight on brothers, fight on
Fight on and free your land
Fight on sisters
Fight on and free your fellow man

Africa has got to be free
By 1983
Come on make us see
Brothers fight on



You have paid your dues
And you have nothing to lose
And that is always my views
You've got to fight on



'Cause if Africa is not free
Then we all will be
Back in shackles you see
My brothers fight on



Brothers of scorn in exile
For such, such a long while
Vasis him too vile



We need majority rule
Scimit and vasta is too cruel
Early morning dew
Fight on



Fight on and free yourself
Fight on and free the land
Fight on and free your fellow man
