This devaluation
(Pound get a blow)
It cause an eruption
(The pound get a blow)

Oh, what a destruction
(The pound get a blow)
Prepare for starvation
(The pound get a blow)

Cost of living get high
I said the pound get low

Remember I told you
You gonna bend down low

 the holy fire comes
You must get a blow

 the holy fire comes
You must get a blow

Why should I care when it's not my care
(It's not my care)
Why be unfair to steal my share?
(Steal my share)

Talk about you rocking steady
(Pound get a blow)
(Pound get a blow)

There shall be weeping and wailing
(Pound get a blow)
There shall be weeping and wailing
(Pound get a blow)

Pound get a blow
Pound get a blow
Pound get a blow
Pound get a blow

This devaluation
(Pound get a blow)
It gonna cause an eruption
(The pound get a blow)

Oh, what a destruction
(The pound get a blow)
So prepare for starvation
(The pound get a blow)
