Said I'm wanted, dread and alive
By the evil forces
Said I'm wanted, dread and alive
Nowhere to hide
They are trying to find me

Babylon charge I for ganja
Which I know couldn't do
How could one man Gang Jah
Must be an ape from the zoo



I've been accused for a shootin'
Which I know never do
Who dem in prison that willing dey
So I've got to pull my way through



Yesterday was court day
And I-Man forget to go
Today my name is in my papers
And next warrant they will show



Now I've got to
Judge two guns
To protect myself from men
'Cause I've never done nothin' wrong
And I hate traveling scared
