I see the mark of the beast on their ugly faces
I see them congregate on evil placed

me said me know them a wicked
me said me know them a wicked
me said me know them a wicked
me said me know them a wicked

what have I done to be incriminated
what have I done to be humiliated

me said me know them a wicked, babylon
me said me know them a wicked

'cause I know

me said me know them a wicked,
me said me know them a wicked

me said me know them a wicked

me said me know them a wicked
me said me know them a wicked
me said me know them a wicked, brutalise
me said me know them a wicked

what have I done to be convicted
what have I got to be...

me said me know them a wicked, babylon
me said me know them a wicked
me said me know them a wicked, them don't have no mercy
me said me know them a wicked

I am so careful of them smiling faces
'cause underneath them... evil...

me said me know them a wicked
me said me know them a wicked
me said me know them a wicked
me said me know them a wicked

me said me know them a wicked, babylon
me said me know them a wicked
me said me know them a wicked,
me said me know them a wicked

lightning me said me know them a wicked
me said me know them a wicked
me said...
