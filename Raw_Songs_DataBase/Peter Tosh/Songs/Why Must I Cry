Why must I cry
these tears from mine eyes




Making believe you love me only
was my great sin whoa 
was my great sin whoa 
was my great sin whoa 


But I will never fall in love again
'cause only my heart feels the pain

Why must I trod
this lonely lonely road
why must I carry
this heavy heavy load

Making believe you love me only
was my great sin 
was my great sin 
was my great sin 

mmm my great sin

I'll never fall in love again
'cause only my heart feels the pain
feels the pain
sad pain

I will never fall in love again
'cause only my heart feels the pain
feels the pain
why must I cry these tears from mine eyes 
why must I cry these tears from mine eyes
