Same dog bite you a morning
Him will bit you a evening
I say, "The same dog bite you a morning
Him will bit you a evening"

So I'm a, once bitten and a twice shy
So please, don't ask me why
Once bitten and a twice shy
So please, don't ask me why

I don't want to hear
A word you say
'Cause I told you long before
It wouldn't work out that way

And now you coming to me
With tears in your eyes
One thing I got to tell you
Step back with your lies

'Cause I'm a once bitten and I'm twice shy
So please, don't ask me why
I'm a once bitten and a twice shy
So please, don't ask me why

Anything I tell you
You always doubt me
But now you found out too late
You couldn't do without me

Same dog bite you a morning
Him will bit you a evening
I say, "The same dog bite you a morning
Him will bit you a evening"

So I'm a once bitten and a twice shy
So please, don't ask me why
Once bitten and a twice shy
So please, don't ask me why

Same dog bite you a morning
Him will bit you a evening
Same dog bite you a morning
Him will bit you a evening

Same dog bite you a morning
Him will bit you a evening
Same dog bite you a morning
Him will bit you a evening

Once bitten
