I said I
I'm gonna testify
What Jah has done for I

When I'm down he picks me up
When I'm empty he fills my cup
When obstacles are in my way
He remove them for me I say



When my friends try to fight me down
Jah says I'm still around
When they dig pits in my way
He remove them for me I say



Satan is working every day
Trying to lead you all astray
Be careful of who you obey
Or you'll be going in Satan's way



While I'm walking through this land
He make me to be a better man
He taught me how to overstand
And he always he lead me by my hand



Every day
Every time
I've got to testify
What Jah has done for I
