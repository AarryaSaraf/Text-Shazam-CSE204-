No bother feel no way
It's coming close to payday I say
No bother feel no way
Every man get paid accord his work this day

Cannot plant peas and reap rice
Cannot plant cocoa and reap yam
Cannot plant turnip and reap tomato
Cannot plant breadfruit and reap potato



Cannot tell lie and hear truth
Cannot live bad and love good
Cannot live up and get down
Cannot give a dollar and want a pound



Cannot be wrong and get right
Cannot be kicked and don't fight
Cannot drink water and get drunk
Cannot drink whiskey and stay sober
