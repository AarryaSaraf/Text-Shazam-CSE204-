Big Proof, rest in peace dudey, we love you
We just wanna keep making you proud, heh

My life is trapped in these lines
That's why I'm packing these nines
I gotta rap I ain't dyin'
That's in the back of my mind
Got a strap made of iron
Can't relax on this grind
Bending over backwards for these slackers
'Til I'm snapping my spine
Natural high...I gotta focus
On these bogus poachers
Looking over my shoulder
Proof get it popping like soda hold up

We nothing but soldiers!!!
Slow up!
This gun is loaded!!!
Roll up!
They beef and we leaving 'em coked up!!!

If Em say it I spray it
If he will it I kill it
We Kilpatrick and ill it
Yo Detroit, know I can feel it
Real as this gun on my waistline
At war we don't waste time
Blow up magic can't take a punch
And fifty can take 9, brah
We got Schoolcraft here at the seven-eight and Dexter
I'm up in Hollis spending dollars ain't feeling no pressure
Yes sir, ya texta' is bitch
Bet you you flinch when Proof shoot up that coup
And wet your whole clique
