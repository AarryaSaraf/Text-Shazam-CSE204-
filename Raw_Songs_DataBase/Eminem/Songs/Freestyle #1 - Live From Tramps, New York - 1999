Ight, look, look, look
I'ma-I'ma say something so y'all hear me, alright?
Yeah

Well, I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled
Pop the same shit that got Tupac killed
Spit game to these hoes, like a soap opera episode
Punch a bitch in the nose 'til her whole face explodes
There's three things I hate, girls, women, and bitches (What?)
I'm that vicious to walk up and drop-kick midgets
They call me Boogie Night, the stalker that walks awkward
Stick figured with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Coming through the airport, sluggish, walking on crutches
Hit a fucking pregnant bitch in her stomach with luggage
It's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out or back out
Lookin for somebody ug' to beat the crap out
I'm bringing you rap singers two middle fingers
Flip you off in French, then translate it to English
Then I'ma vanish off the face of the planet and come back
Speaking so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it

Alright?
Yo
What you wanna do?
Y'all want to hear wild?
I see some of y'all gettin' wild
