Album: StraightFromTheVault

// The People's Champ (Intro) //

I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back

They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me

This is a beat with no words at first, it's a blank painting
Exercising the mind, it's brain strength training

My motto is live by the bottle
So why is my supply low? Bring in a truckload with a high-low

My name is Chauncey Billups, I'm kind of like a raunchy Phillips
Screwdriver, my crew's live when you can't sleep and you're still up

I came in this game with, bad intentions
And I ain't budged, not even an inch since then

Lava on my lips I flips, wake up think I have a cramp
I'm trying to shove the lava lamp up my father's ass

Got my self esteem back, got my confidence up
I'm gonna step up on this stage now, I'm gonna strut

Shady man, I done told you once homie to easy up
But you just won't listen will ya? Nah, I guess not

// Get Money (Freestyle) //

Yeah, yeah, I get it
I run this rap shit, now guess who's back
You thought I left you, now why would I do that? (1, 2, 3)

They keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best
Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it
From the fact that I'm comin' back
Or maybe it's cause I ain't black, maybe it's because of that
Maybe it's because I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap
While I'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques
I'm still sick, how can I be sick this long
And I'm still alive, Magic Johnson arise
I thrive on makin' my opponents think that I've died
That's when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there
Damn I forgot how much money he got
On the beach of Saint-Tropez, but your man don't lay
In the sun cause I don't tan, I burn, blood clot
When you gonna learn how much money we've earned
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25
And coulda retired at 29 in my 20â€²s still
And Fif' here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit
And he ain't even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
No more, oh boy, goddamn did he score
To go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store
And Shady hit the box office man, he knocked the socks off us
My ex-wife is set for life, you profitless cocksuckers
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay
I'm just a super easy modest MC, okay?
Til I hear the word has been, that's when I start spazzin'
Smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then
I'm the best thing that ever happened to rap, bastards
I'm a blonde Dre, now gimme Kanye's glasses!

// Emulate //

Obie the person that came up introverted
'Cause of nervousness, that was solely the only verdict
It was worth it 'cause he changed, became so observant
Servin' such of a purpose
If you knew him earlier in his days, it's like a different version
So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
That's why it's curtains in this murder, if you get him worked up
I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers acting tougher
Had enough of isolatin' myself in a room
Writing poems and songs, doing the same in school
Now look what he became, a fool
'Cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
Livin' hard but still Julliard
A god walks and ain't spend a day in the pew
Regardless of this I draw visual, pictures when a nigga vents
So welcome to the art department

I stimulate the brain, mimic, emulate the sane
Cynics keep on thinkin' it's a fuckin' gimmick when it ain't
Clinically insane, brain is on Venus, up Uranus
Label me a genius if you ever seen us you would say
"He may seem as though he's plain normal" if you ever meet him
Greet him with a shake, see he ain't as mean as what they say
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say
So he's vague, so they mistake him for bein' crazed
You part ways, your impression of him changed
You don't think he's strange, you turn around and tell him; "Peace and thanks"
You catch him flippin' you off, with his pants down
Hands around his scrotum, tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs

Obie the person that came up introverted
'Cause of nervousness, that was solely the only verdict
It was worth it 'cause he changed, became so observant
Servin' such of a purpose
If you knew him earlier in his days, it's like a different version
So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain
That's why it's curtains in this murder, if you get him worked up
I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers acting tougher
Had enough of isolating myself in a room
Writing poems and songs, doing the same in school
Now look what he became, a fool
'Cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
Livin' hard but still Julliard
A god walks and ain't spend a day in the pew
Regardless of this I draw visual, pictures when a nigga vents
So welcome to the art department

It's all psychologic, why am I so maniacal?
Am I a psycho or some kind of psychotic shtick?
Or am I truly psychotic? Or my molecules just diabolical?
'Cause biologically, I defy logic, by golly, haul me off on a trolley
Probably want a quack, or I'm back on that whacky tobacca
I'ma step away from crack, Obie smacked the shit out of me
I'm so slap happy, man, snap me back to reality
I'm a walkin' art gallery, a science museum
Elephantitis of the nuts, you'd probably die if you see them
I pull them out, they hit the ground and probably crack the cement
I need an ambulance, I can't just put them back in my pants (Help me!)

// Things Get Worse //

There's no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just how far will this go?
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won't listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can't can ya? Man, I can't stand ya
You're rotten, what you plottin' for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better

Holy Toledo, it's Angelina Jolie, amigo
She told me "Yo, Shady just hand your penis to me, I'll deep throat,"
And Brad if you try to stand between us then we're gonna see, bro
Who was a fantasy, I don't mean to damage your ego
You faggots wanna 'rassle?
I shove a fucking jar of Vaseline up inside your asshole
And rope it shut with a lasso
Couple of crushed Lexapro broken up with the capsule or Paxil
Just in case I ain't dope enough with the raps, though
Coke is cut with tobacco, smoke it up, then go wacko
This is what happens when you mix a coconut with Tabasco
Shady let go, the ho has been choked enough, let her ass go
Not till Jessica Simpson lets go of the tuna casserole
I used to love her hooters now Carmen Electra's cuter
Strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
I'm off my fucking meds, but I'm on an electric scooter
I might just scoot by and shoot my mom in the neck with rugers
Spit in Jason's face while I vomit on Freddy Kruegar
They can't even get Jeffrey Dahmer to pet the cougar
Now I'm gone get the rectal thermometer, get the lubra-
Cation and get the patient some Darvocet to chew 'cause

There's no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
 B.o.B I done told you once homie to easy up, jeez
There's no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
Cause I will never lay down
And I will never let up
I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better

With the soul of a Shaman
I'll eat a beat then vomit
Like a bulimic woman with an uneasy stomach
I pass by people on the street they seem like sheep and zombies
Stiffer than a therapeutic pair of jeans you run in
So can you hear me coming
Eminem this beat is absolutely disgusting
It's probably got diseases on it
I'm just being honest, I can see the comments
I can see the evolution as we creep up on it
I put that music in your veins like a needle junkie
Shit I just do this for the haters, I don't need the money
I'm diarrhea on the track so it needs plunging
Somebody please tell these girls to release my undies
Nobody really understands my language
I find it complicated just to hold a conversation
But still I got a whole lot of patience
Sittin' back watching Earth from my Space station

There's no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just how far will this go?
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won't listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can't can ya? Man, I can't stand ya
You're rotten, what you plottin' for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better

Oh my gosh I put Natasha Bedingfield in a washer
Watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
It's like I got ya hypnotized and I forgot ya
My God, ya psychologically fucked
Michael would like an apology, what?
Tell that psycho to stick a Tyco truck and a white tricycle up his butt
And glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts
I'm as cold as a motherfucking icicle I'm a nut
I ain't nuttin' nice, man I like to pull knives and I like to cut
The poster addict for post traumatic stress
I guess this is the most dramatic I've been in a while
This is the closest that it's come to the Marshall Mathers
I can hear him start to gather
I don't paint the portrait of the picture perfect Partridge family
This ain't your orphan Annie, no this is more uncanny
Kick down Dakota Fanning's front door while the whore is tanning
("He can't say whore"), of course he can, man he just saw her fanny
Then murdered her while he danced around the room and wore her panties

There's no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just how far will this go?
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady man, I done told you once homie to ease up
But you just won't listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can't can ya? Man, I can't stand ya
You're rotten, what you plottin' for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse 'fore they get better

Custom-fitted, custom-kitted wood grain
Custom everything, what's that on the seat? Custom mustard stain

"Tracy, I joined this class 'cause I thought I'd be cooking with a partner
But she's never here, and I don't get twice the credit for all the work."

"I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth."

"I know, but I'm over here in my unit, every day, cooking my terrible-tasting food, and then I gotta look over at Evan. I mean, look at him, it looks like the most fun I've ever seen in my entire life. And, I'm just saying, I wash and dry, I'm like a single mother. And no offense but, everyone takes this class to get an A and it's bullshit, but uh, no offense, I'm just saying. And I'm not putting down your profession, but when am I gonna need to cook tiramisu? Am I gonna be a chef? No. There's 3 weeks left in school, give me a freaking break, sorry for cursing. Oh my God, that's like the coolest fucking story I've ever heard in my life! It's insane. Can you tell us again? Do you have time? Tracy, Tracy, can you hear me? I'm in the car right now. Listen, I am McLovin, yeah. McLovin in the house! McLovin in the house! Yeah!"

// Going Crazy //

Fame, fame, fame
I think it's got me goin' crazy
Oh, oh
I get lost in this game, game, game
I'm gettin' tired of all you naysayers
Oh, oh
Keep speaking my name, name, name
You gon' have reason to hate me
Yeah
It's like you don't want me to win
So this time I'm goin' in!

This the life of a rocker
JÃ¤germeister and vodka
Hoppin' off of the club's balcony
Into the crowd, surfin'
And when they drop me, I'm randomly sockin' fans
And when my interviews in hockey masks
Slap the journalists on their ass
I'm high off speed
Drivin' my car at high speed
Pocket full of weed, while lesbians swallow E
I'm in the studio ignant
My engineer gon' call police
I fell asleep on the soundboard and get us songs for weeks
LSD be all up in my head
Giving thanks to Grateful Dead
Bustin' in the air, with 30 bitches up in my bed
I'm kickin' 'em out naked, and this December
Niggas ask me why I did it, but fuck it I can't remember

Fame, fame, fame
I think it's got me goin' crazy
Oh, oh
I get lost in this game, game, game
I'm gettin' tired of all you naysayers
Oh, oh
Keep speaking my name, name, name
You gon' have reason to hate me
Yeah
It's like you don't want me to win
So this time I'm goin' in!

Some boys are wiling
Drinkin', cussin', and hyper smilin'
Been ridin' for days, tour bus look like ryker's island
Henny Jack Daniels, spray paintin' the die hard fan
Little cocker spaniel, fresh out of the damn zoo
Man you, better be conscious, I'm backstage
Livin' it up, with a couple of sluts feelin' nauseous
From drinkin' it's been a couple of days, since I've slept
My dick is sore from fuckin', when I bust there's nothin' left
Just dust, back on the stage, give me my microphone
Scrappin' with the audience while we perform hyper song
Our label presented us with a plaque
Brought it on stage, and bashed it to pieces with an aluminum bats, stanks
Now which one of you bitches down for the cause
Yeah I said my dick is sore but I ain't say shit about my balls
Last call then we off to the next city, yeah
Whatever I didn't drink on my bladder pack it up and take the rest with me

Fame, fame, fame
I think it's got me goin' crazy
Oh, oh
I get lost in this game, game, game
I'm gettin' tired of all you naysayers
Oh, oh
Keep speaking my name, name, name
You gon' have reason to hate me
Yeah
It's like you don't want me to win
So this time I'm goin' in!

Yeah this game has got me goin' crazy
Fuck it, I am crazy
What's new, what kinda fuckin' glue you'd think I'd be if I was glue
We lost Proof, he was our crew's glue
But where was you, when we were fallin' apart
You were shitting on us too
But no one but us knew we were beefin'
Cause that's what happens when you beef with crew
It stays in the crew, cause it's just crew
But we're back now, yeah we took our time while our blood grew
Only thing we're in a hurry for now is to rush you!
And we're back, these days if you don't got the guts or the nuts to
Pussy, go pick your pussy leaves off your cunt tree, fuck you
Ah choo!
Bless you! I'm allergic to pussy, sluts too
Yeah, you think you the shit, till we flush you
Have some bullshit to readjust
Still got a just a few of us left, but it'd be unjust to rob us our just due
So rest in peace to Bugz and Proof
This one's for you homies, we love you
But we can't stop now we done had too much of our blood drew from this

Fame, fame, fame
I think it's got me goin' crazy
Oh, oh
I get lost in this game, game, game
I'm gettin' tired of all you naysayers
Oh, oh
Keep speaking my name, name, name
You gon' have reason to hate me
Yeah
It's like you don't want me to win
So this time I'm goin' in!

Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee

Got a dick as big as a banana
I try to control it, but I guess I can't, it
Shoots off like an AK-clip banana
You better watch out, Hannah Montana
Man, what's the matter, have you no manners?
No you know the girl from Juno's address
Yeah, I'ma probably go to jail for that
Now I got the cops on my tail for that
Run up on your car with a stale banana
In your tail pipe, can't believe you fell for that
It could've been a Molotov cocktail for that
Wait a minute, man, what the hell was that?
I heard a noise, where you going? What are you, bananas?
You can't go back there, stupid ass
I just seen a woman in a Freddy Kruger mask
Who the fuck are you? Superman?
All you have is a little stupid can
Of whipped cream, what the hell you gonna do with that?
I'ma put it on my wee-wee, ooh, good answer
Super bonanza extravaganza
Man, go ahead, what you waiting for?
You better get them clothes off, baby boy
Come on, let's go, we're gonna make a porn

Are you ready? You better hold the camera steady
She's probably back there with a damn machete
She's probably gonna eat you like canned spaghetti
She's probably gonna kill you, still wanna check, see
Have a little quick look, go on, sick prick
She's probably six foot tall like Big Foot
The hell with that, we probably should run
Don't dare look back, we probably, probably
Probably there probably was a problem
At the post office or something
But you probably didn't know that, did you?
Now, what you gonna do when she gets you?
I ain't going with you, forget you
Quit tryna hold my hand, mister
Pretend she's your little sister, little sister
[?]
Might as well take the whipped cream with you
And when you see her, make sure you get a picture
We could try to make another Blair Witch, uh, movie
A bestiality porno with smoothies

Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange

Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
Put it on my wee-wee

It's eerie, but here comes Zack and Miri
Beauty and the Beast, his back is hairy
But she don't care, they're attractive, very
Very sexually active, very
No, Zack, don't go back in there
It's too late now, she's grabbin' hair
He screams, bloody Mary, grabs a mirror
But 'stop' just ain't in her vocabulary
Get off me, please, get off me, stop
Balling back at a coffee shop
They go non-stop, she says go
He says no, she says oh
Back and forth, they scream and shout
Yeah, boy, let them demons out
It's the kind of nightmare you dream about
Uh-oh, now the whipped cream is out
I get sick thoughts, sick, sick, thoughts
Things you could do with your lipstick gloss
Put it on my dick 'til the tip looks orange
Bitch, keep goin', bitch, keep goin'

// G.O.A.T. //

And I'm willing to borrow your grass
But I specialize in eating MCs
In the immortal words of LL Cool J
As he would say: I'm a G.O.A.T.
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the "greatest of all time"
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes!

This is the part I was worried about
Everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
And I'm in some dusty garage inhaling them carbon monoxide fumes
And everyone's telling me what I should do
And how I should come out and what to rap about
And I know that I got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out
And I'm not sure how this is gonna come off
They're probably gonna think that I'm coming off as cocky (ha ha)
Like I just started giving a fuck what you really think about me
See, the thing about me
Is you don't really know a thing about me
Everyone's making a stink about me
Like there's some kind of a aura of that of the king around me
Surround me with nothin' but gangsters, killers, and bangers
And the most dangerous criminals
And I feel like I'm more comfortable around them than I do my own motherfuckin' neighbors
But, see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave
But why does it seem like I'm not even put up in the same category as other MCs?
So when Weezy says that he's better than Jay-Z
Please, be that just subliminally
Means he thinks Jigga's the best and that he's
The only one up in that league, see
And it's easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is
Knowing goddamn well that I'm one of the best motherfucking rappers who ever lived period

I'm a G.O.A.T.
And I don't mean to gloat
But I know what I know and I know what you think
And these magazines'll never put it in ink
Because how would it look if they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the "greatest of all time"
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes!

Maybe they figure that I'm on my way out the game
So they gotta go try to find em a new Eminem
Or a new Shady, if they think it's gonna happen
Man, I thought I was crazy
Or maybe I could be takin' it wrong and they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way
So let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
See, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringing up that Paul Wall's white
'Cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see, he's just aight
And Bubba Sparxxx, he just won't write
Because he's so caught up in that snow white
That Timbaland can't even get him in the studio
He's so gone off that coke, right
And it's so sad, 'cause he's dope, right
America's next great white hope, right
So now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny-ass white-rapper show, right
And which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about
They said it'd be real, I'm just spillin' it out
There's somethin' about a white boy talking black and runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth
And I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit
"Isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white and the best golfer's black?"
And I'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack off of that
But these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until 8 Mile had came out
But I had already hit middle America
Parents had all got to likin' me now
When suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy
All of the hatred for me must've died
Thought I committed career suicide so I had to turn back into the bad guy
So faggoty faggoty faggoty gays
Anatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy
Not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy
And Angelina Jolie is just another ho
And Brad is a sucka' because once I fuck her
She wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby
You know what I say? No
You better save some of them kids from Madonna
She needs all the publicity she can get
You wanted Shady? Well, you got it, man
I ain't apologizin' for shit

I'm a G.O.A.T.
And I don't mean to gloat
But I know what I know and I know what you think
And these magazines'll never put it in ink
Because how would it look if they considered me as a G.O.A.T.?
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the "greatest of all time"
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes!

Man, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home, man
Shit is too easy
Nobody even wants to pass me the ball 'cause
(I'm a G.O.A.T.)
So don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game
And y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best
But y'all know that
(I'm a G.O.A.T.)
And like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best
Before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch
But before I go, I'd like to say fuck you very much to everybody who wasn't there from the start
And thank you very much to everybody who was
And y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it
'Cause I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that you know
(I'm a G.O.A.T.)
(Hahahaha)
I'm out, y'all
It's been real, peace

// The Apple //

I'm a little nutty and I know it but if you go back and take a look at my history
You will see that I am not the only one who's off his rocker, there were many before me
I was always labeled the black sheep of the family, what a bad seed I'd grow to be
But if you take a look at us now you'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree

Haha! Haha, haha, haha!
Alright look
I'mma tell you the story from my side
Maybe you'll understand, check it out

You done witnessed unexplainable shit
Too insane to explain, people run from what they just don't get
Maybe Shady should have just hit 'em with a little bit
Did I spit too soon? Should I have spoon fed 'em it?
But I was just so eager to prove I was even
Worth bein' in the same league or the room
Of the people of whom I was in
Every now and then, I look up like I was seekin' approval
Was it because of the pigment of my skin?
Or was it a figment of my imagination?
Maybe it bothered me more than it did them
Maybe it wasn't a big deal back then
But to me it was, see what it was
Was I had developed a complex from being judged
Proof spit his verse, now I'm next, let's see who balks
I'm in the booth staring back to see whose mugs
I get a reaction from, usually the first thumb
Was from Proof and the rest of the crew backed him up
And no one lied to each other 'cause none of us had deals
It was real, we just wanted tickets for that meal

Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

Ever since my mother was pregnant with a second egg
'Cause she said that I had a baby sister
Who fell out of the window, I was too young to remember
Kansas City projects, I was like five/six
And how come, I remember Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogy
If it was the projects in Missouri?
'Cause those were my best friends until Isaac
Took my tricycle and my Uncle Todd went to try to go get it back
And ended up gettin' jumped and cut in the gut
With a switch and seventy-some stitches
Which is, to this day, why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture
Of a fictitious little sister who never existed
And this is why a part of my life's so twisted
But I can never be as sick as that bitch is
And by the way, that picture's one of my relatives

Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

You probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain
To see why everything I say is so insane
What's different about my brain
That separates me from other players in this game?
On the surface, it may seem like a scheme
Or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy
But that's the last thing I need
Is for people to walk around feelin' sorry for me
And I am not a G, never claimed to be
I gave my vest to Cashis, just hope he don't need it more than me
But we'll see, 'cause we ain't lookin' for beef
But if it comes our way, what do we turn the other cheek? Come on

Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I feel like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
'Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree

Yeah, and I'm the crazy one right?
Whatever, then let me be the crazy one!

Thank my mom, bitch
Haha

But before I go

// Fly Away //

Some people ask me where I've been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted and try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, say I'm crazy
They ask me what I think and I say maybe
I'll fly away (Fly away)
It ain't nothing in the way so I may as well
Fly away (Fly away)
And ain't nothing else to say so I may as well
Fly away (Fly away)
I know you wanna see me down but we ain't gon'
Die today (Die today)
'Cause I done been to the top and there's nowhere else to go
(Yeah, yeah) Yeah
And the only way to see me's if you looking up from down below
(Down below, yeah, yeah) Yeah
There's nothing else to say so I may as well
Fly away (Oh)
Yeah, there's nothing in my way so I may as well
Fly away
I'm on top of this thing so I may as well fly away
Yeah

Got my self-esteem back, got my confidence up
I'ma step up on this stage now, I'm gonna strut
And walk around with my pants hangin' off of my butt
And you ain't 'bout to tell me nothing, boy, get off of my nuts
It goes one for the money, two for the show
My shit don't stink, I don't think so
Wipe my ass with the tissue and roll it back up in the roll
Are you ready now, here we go, the bald eagle has landed
I'm back in your hair, sorry for leavin' you stranded
I'm twice as dreaded, evil and rancid
They can't sit, I don't think anybody understands it
Especially when the world's silly putty in your hands, it's Play-Doh
I ain't back to play, though, they say he died in a fatal
Car crash, shows what they know
Shit if I did, it'd be a trailer not a car
The white trash star, I fuck an RV-up like Brett Favre
Homie, you got it backwards, you're dipping your soup inside your crackers
I can carry rap till my back hurts
Set it down, go right back to the chiropractors
Get my back right then I'm right back on you bastards
I was chasing the dragon, I don't know what happened
It's like the feeling I had when I first started rappin', I just
Couldn't seem to get back and recapture that magic, so I went back
To the lab, that's where I've been at, when

Some people ask me where I've been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody could save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted and try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me

And ain't nothing else to say so I may as well
Fly away

I took a hiatus, haters, now I'm back to cause trouble
Got the fuckin' shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles, I'm the
[*Explosion*] you ain't fucking sick, the hospital
Won't even give you cough drops for coughs, cocksucker
You think you hot? You ain't even lukewarm my puke's hotter than you
You're soft, I use fire to cool me off
I told 'em I'd grow up one day and show 'em I'd be able to choke clouds
Pick up lightning bolts and throw 'em
Take the world by storm with these words I form
Georgi-porgi kissed the girls, make the girls cry for it
Make 'em swarm, make 'em fight over the shirts I've worn
Swoon over my sweat towels, it's mind blowin'
Yes, I'm livin' the dream, homie, can't nothing compare
I'm so up, I'm stuck in midair, I'm lovin' it, yeah
It's like these people are steps now, all they do is stare
These haters are so pussy, they afraid to be scared
This is pay back, like I owe 'em back pay
They spat in my face, now I'm back to do them the same exact way
And leave this rap game with a bad taste
And slap it back out before I step back outta this crap, they
Slap me, now I'm slappin' 'em back, hey
Fuck it, we're slap happy, yeah, okay, now I'm talking some smack, ayy
And I ain't looking back, in fact, they can stare at my ass crack
How's that for hind sight? What the track say?
