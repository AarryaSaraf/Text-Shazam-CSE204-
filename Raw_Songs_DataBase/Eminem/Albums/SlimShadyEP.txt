// Low, Down, Dirty //

"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

Warning, this shit's gon' be rated R, restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self-inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma, "Bitch, you got a sick kid"
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
'Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
(Murder-murder, redrum)
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from?
Inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated
"How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?"
Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out (RRRAH!), killed the bitch and did her
Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?
Bring your bitch, I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her

"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

I lace tunes, that's out this world like space moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin' brains like graze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippets, passed out like sampler snippets
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Lace it up with cocaine so he can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the rum
Or any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage, smoked out like Eckrich
Dandruff's making my neck itch, what the fuck? Give me the check bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap dips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, then probably one of us broke in

"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Blitzin' like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin (Allah, Allah)
Delinquent, choking microphones with broken English
Make your mama be like "Whoo, this is good! Who sings this?"
"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I dug it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit"
It was predicted by a medic, I'd grow
To be an addicted diabetic, living on liquid Triaminic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicking, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen mannequin, posin' stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying, God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it lives
The closest they gon' come is 2Pac
It's politics, it's all a fix
Set up for these white blue-collared hicks
It's to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
For those who kiss ass and swallow dicks

"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
"Low down dirty even" I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from

// Mommy (Skit) //

[*The sound of a body being dragged across the ground. The body is thrown in the trunk of a car, which is then closed shut.*]

// Just The Two Of Us //

(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Baby, your dada loves you
And I'ma always be here for you
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
No matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
I would never give you up for nothin'
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (Yeah)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sleepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I (See, honey)

There's a place called Heaven and a place called Hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one
'Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother, do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough
To understand a little better, I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad
Was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time out
Sit back in your chair, honey, quit tryna climb out
I told you it's okay, Hai-Hai, want a ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo-ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Dada change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

Wake up, sleepyhead, we're here, before we play
We're gonna take Mama for a little walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry, honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sleepy to hear you screaming' in her ear (Mama)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (Yeah)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee (whoosh)
There goes Mama, splashin' in the water
No more fightin' with Dad, no more restraining order
No more step-dada, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell Mama you love her (Mommy)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help Dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I

(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you, baby, is all we need in this world
(Just the two of us, just the two of us)
Just me and you
Your dada will always be here for you
Your dada's always gonna love you, remember that
If you ever need me, I'ma always be here for you
You ever need anything, just ask
Dada will be right there
Your dada loves you
I love you, baby

// No One's Iller Than Me //

Yeahâ€¦ ha ha ha (Bang!)
Yeah, Bizarre Kid comin' at you
Eminem and Fuzz and Mr. Swifty, ha ha
No one's iller than me (What?)
No one, no one is iller than me
No one is iller than me
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313

I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meaning
Got your whole crew doin' subpoenas
Hell nah, you ain't seen a crew, genius
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
Keep it close, you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like Gs, you best believe this
I done made quadriplegics outta these non-rappin' rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape
It ain't no secret that your shit sounds fake
You can't stop it, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
I'm like toothaches: I'm painful to rappers
Then you can tell from these shells
How I gotta bend 'em like root canals
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linking trials
Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates â€“ BLAAAOW!
It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said, no one is iller than me, unnhh

Me and Eminem and Mike, drivin' down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason
Should be takin' my medication, it's nine to ten I'm facin'
Last week this old man I had to blast
'Cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route
Throwin' bombs at day care centers and yell, "Everybody get out!"
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a two-piece
'Cause she found out I was havin' an affair
With her 10-year-old niece

No one, no one's iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313

Nobody better test me, 'cause I don't wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dipped freshly
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth, crack open a six
I'm on my seventh 8-Ball, now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was?
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does
They probably don't be packin' anyways â€” do they, Fuzz?
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted, stab your abdomen
With a hand-crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin' felon, headed to Hell in a hand basket
Talkin' shit'll get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van, wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked
By these fantastic furious four motherfuckers
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grandmasters
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me

I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
Ask the feds if I'm past the edge
Rockin' the most classic threads, flashin' bread
Roll down the window, "Bitch, you got some fantastic legs!"
You can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre, you get him and him
Swift, you get him and him, I'll get him and him
Leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screamin', "Get the cops, quick!"
And got drop kicked, now she screamin', "Stop it!"
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop, bitch, Fuzz Scoota '97 crop pick
Sick of y'all niggas lookin' at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggas still don't know the top pick
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
And have you shittin' socks, bitch
P Rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split
Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits
(No one) â€” Ain't nobody iller than me

It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313

You have now witnessed four ill emcees
From the home of potholes and trash
We'll lyrically blast

// Murder Murder //

"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"
"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"

Left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands
The shit is in my hands, here's your lifespan
And for what your life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland
See, I'm a nice man, but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'
Hurry up with the cash, bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin'
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description and sketches ya
Then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
'Cause I got a daughter to feed
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell
And hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' a MAC
Co-operate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin' the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nothin' for her to be smoked
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin', "Freeze!"
But I'm already wanted for sellin' keys
And a bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit me square in the chest, wasn't wearin' a vest

"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"
"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"

Left the house, pullin' out the drive, backin' out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin' out
Pulled the MAC-10 out
Stuck it in her face, "Shut your yackin' mouth
'Fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp!"
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Figured, "Fuck itâ€”mug her while you're there," jacked her up
Stole her car and made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and loft it
Out the window like the girl in Set It Off did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive, but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin', "Johnny, go in and call the police!
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores, the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
And collided with an eighty-year-old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, musta been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped a Beanie Baby
Fuck it, I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin', "Truce-truce!" (Don't shoot!)
And surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me, it was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps

"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mind state"
"Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"
