When he woke up
He saw the faces of the mighty Cherokee
They'd found Shamrock and him
Passed out together
Underneath the forest canopy
Saw his Tomahawk and skins
And knew that he was a Shawnee
So to see the Chief he now must go
One and all they did agree

The old man stared into his soul
Though he was blind
As he could be
Said if you're looking for your woman
It is here that you shall find she
Said a man McClure had traded her for horses
On which he used so he could flee
Dood said she wasn't his to trade
He stole her away and he shot me
Then the old man whispered softly
Her you now must go and see

When she saw him
She cried tears of joy
And he saw his soul
In eyes blue as sea
Chief didn't need no eyes to know he was hers
And she belonged to he
He said "I'm sorry for your troubles"
"She must go back home with thee"
Said get your mule
And waved his palm
Said you both now may go in peace
So Dood climbed back up
On ol Shamrock
He and Juanita went home happily
