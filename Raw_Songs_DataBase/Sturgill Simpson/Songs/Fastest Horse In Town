I been wasting all my best days
I invested all my worst ways
I've been thinking about all the things
I should have never left behind
Oughta be watching the children playing
In the yard I never see I should be mowing today
Instead, I'm searching for ways to say
All the words I can't find

Everybody's trying to be the next someone
But look at me, I'm trying to be the first something

Back when dollars made sense
Had to keep the squirrels off the fence
And shoes are coming loose on the fastest horse in town
But that old horse just keeps on running
If he falls, they'll put him down
Them men keeping him out on the track
Running him ragged just to pile up the stacks
Make it so he's all spent by the time he gets back

Everybody's trying to be the next someone
Look at me, I'm trying to be the first something
Look at me, I'm trying to be the first something

Everybody's trying to be the next someone
Look at me, I'm trying to be the first something
Look at me, I'm trying to be the first something

(Well, you know what I want?
We need, we need a gift card for
Are y'all listening to me? This is what I want
I want a gift card from God
He can keep it all
I want a gift card from God)
