There's a lonely feeling that I carry
That will follow me all my days
I walked out on the heart you were nursing
Turned my back on a love you saved

Well, just when my clouds were drifting
My plan got rearranged
But there ain't no going back now
And ain't no way that I can change

I believe that I found God
About the same time that I found you
All that stuff about heaven and angels
Well, I know now that it's all true

But you drift in and out of my dreams now
Like a ship out at sea in a storm
And when I wake up every morning
I roll over and find you still gone
Gone

I'm alone in a way that I've never been
Since you left me behind
If you think you can ever love me again
Please go ahead, I don't mind
Oh, no

It feels like you're so far away now
And I'm stuck out here all by myself
All the things I wish I had told you
Still inside my mind bottled and shelved

In my dreams although I can hear you
There's a darkness that hides you from sight
So I search all around trying to feel you
All I find is a world without light

There's a world I want to leave
And a world where I want to stay
There's a dream that I believe
When I wake up it goes away

I'm alone in a way that I've never been
Since you left me behind
If you think you can ever love me again
Please go ahead, I don't mind
