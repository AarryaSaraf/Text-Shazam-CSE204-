Grey is the color of my world since you left me
On that bright and sunny, orange and mournful day
No more rainbows shining out my window
Like you my skies of blue have gone away

I guess you bought and sold all the silver and the gold
This old world don't seem to shine no more
Yellow, purple, pink, and red have been replaced by lead
Like the foggy hollow that I'm headed for

And all the colors are bleeding
Where's ol' Van Gogh when you need him
I bet you my left ear he can relate
And all the pretty blue is fading
From the sea of tears I'm wading
And it's cause of you my world's gone grey

Well, some say grey's a better way to live than blue
Not quite black and white but in between
But I've been so down ever since those eyes of brown
Followed white lines back to pines eternal green

And all the colors are bleeding
Where's ol' Van Gogh when you need him
I bet you my left ear he can relate
And all the pretty blue is fading
From the sea of tears I'm wading
And it's cause of you my world's gone grey

And all the pretty blue is fading
From the sea of tears I'm wading
And it's cause of you my world's gone grey
