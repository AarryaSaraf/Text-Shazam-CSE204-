Lately things have been a little complicated
Quality of life has got me down
Sex is cheap and talk is overrated
And the boys and me still working on the sound

A little happiness, a little love was all I wanted
Sure as Hell thought I'd found it but I was wrong
She left my heart feeling taunted and my memories all haunted
But it's her I have to thank for all my songs

So every day I'm smoking my brain hazy
All I can do to keep from going crazy
But the paranoia is slowly creeping in
I keep drinking myself silly
Only way for this hillbilly
And I thank God for this here life of sin

Every morning when I rise I look in the mirror and despise
the sight of everything and all that I've become
The level of my medicating some might find intimidating
But that's alright cause' it don't bother me none
