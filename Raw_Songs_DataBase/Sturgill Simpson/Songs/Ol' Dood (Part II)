He found Seumas sitting in a bottom perched upon a bay
Dood figured that he was about three hundred yards away
But Saemus didn't know that he was deadly as can be
Thought he was out of range of that rifle from Cantuckee

Dood laid that old long rifle right across a fallen tree
Took moonlight sight on Seumas let that iron ball fly free
His shot was true as David's rock and it found its mark for sure
Knocked him flying from his horse the one they call McClure

Left the varnish off his words, feared no beast nor man
And if either came upon him they'd damn sure get slayed
He was harder than the nails hammered Jesus' hands
He was the one they called Dood
Son of a mountain miner and a Shawnee maiden

Ol' Dood walked down the holler to go inspect his man
He found Seumas playing possum knife ready in his hand
But Ol' Dood saw it coming, beat him to the draw
Moon went bouncing off that tomahawk is the last thing ol' Seumas ever saw

He left the varnish off his words, feared no beast nor man
Didn't wanna end up in his debt, 'cause it'd damn sure get paid
He was harder than the nails hammered Jesus' hands
He was the one they called Dood
Son of a mountain miner and a Shawnee maiden
Son of a mountain miner and a Shawnee maiden
