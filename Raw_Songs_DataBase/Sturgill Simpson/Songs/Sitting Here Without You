You could have told me you didn't care about me
You could have told me you was the cheating kind
I'd be out on the town running around
seeing what else I could find
Instead of sitting here without you
and with you on my mind

I'm all alone in the night
and I know you ain't coming back to me
There's a moon over me so bright
It lights up my sorrow for everyone to see

You could have told me you didn't care about me
You could have told me you was the cheating kind
I'd be out on the town running around
seeing what else I could find
Instead of sitting here without you
and with you on my mind

Don't have to tell nobody how I'm feeling
Don't have to tell nobody how I cry
It's written on my face cause' I know you're out there stealing
All them sweet, sweet kisses from all them other guys
