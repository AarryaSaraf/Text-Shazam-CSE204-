I have always tried to keep my glass full
Sometimes I have whiskey and sometimes wine
Baby, why is it whenever your glass is empty
You come along and knock over mine?

I'd like to tell you that I can make it without you
And I won't shed a tear when you walk out the door
Lord knows I've been down that road a time or two
But then I've never been without you before

I couldn't tell you how much I paid for this bottle
And how long we've been here your guess is as good as mine
Sometimes that wine don't hit me like it ought to
But that old whiskey suits me fine

I'd like to tell you that I can make it without you
And I won't shed a tear when you walk out the door
Lord knows I've been down that road a time or two
But then I've never been without you before

Drove me to drinking, ran off with some other man
But a broken heart heals like a bottle empties with time
Well, since you've been gone life's been more than I can stand
So sometimes whiskey and sometimes there's wine

I'd like to tell you that I can make it without you
And I won't shed a tear when you walk out the door
Lord knows I've been down that road a time or two
But then I've never been without you before
But then I've never been without you before
