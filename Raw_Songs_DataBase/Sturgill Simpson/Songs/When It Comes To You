If we can't get along
We ought to be apart
And I'm wondering where'd you get that cold, cold heart
Set me free, sign my release
I'm tired of being a villain of the peace

You've been giving me bad times, tell me, what'd I do?
I always get a hard time, honey, when it comes to you
Saying them things that you didn't have to
How come I always get a hard time, honey, when it comes to you?

You only get one life, and this I know
I want to get my licks in now before I go
Fire of love is dead and cold
I got to satisfy the hunger in my soul

You've been giving me bad times, tell me, what'd I do?
How come I always get a hard time, honey, when it comes to you?
Saying the things that you didn't have to
How come I always get a hard time, honey, when it comes to you?

If we can't get along
We ought to be apart
And I'm wondering where'd you get that cold, cold heart
Set me free, sign my release
I'm tired of being a villain of the peace

You've been giving me bad times, tell me, what'd I do?
How come I always get a hard time, honey, when it comes to you?
Saying things that you didn't have to
How come I always get a hard time, honey, when it comes to you?
How come I always get a hard time, honey, when it comes to you?
