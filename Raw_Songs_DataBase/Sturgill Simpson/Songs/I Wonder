Loneliness is setting in
How I feel you don't know
All my tomorrows, they depend
On how my todays go
Ain't seen your face for a few years or more
You don't write, you don't call
Tell me what are all the memories for
When you don't remember at all?

I'm sad and lonely
I wonder do you feel the same
Tell me am I the only one
Drinking and cursing your name?

Maybe someday you'll walk into
Some bar I'm singing in
You'll hang your head in sorrow and cry
When you see the shape that I'm in

Oh, I'm sad and lonely
I wonder do you feel the same
Tell me am I the only one
Drinking and cursing your name?

Tell me am I the only one
Drinking and cursing your name?
