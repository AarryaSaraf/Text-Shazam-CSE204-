Words can stab as deep as night
And cut like razor thorn
Bitter air and winds of spite
Like the cold of winters scorn
Leaves may fall on sleeping ground
But the wind sweeps them away
Like hurt lovers in the final round
What once was in now decay

I can't go on living alone now that you're gone

A single strand of spider's weave
Just dancing in the sun
Please don't turn around and leave
You are my only one
Compromise is made out of peace
But history is made out of violence
After the war of words has ceased
All that's left is the deafening silence

I can't go on living alone now that you're gone
You done me wrong so here's your song
Now sing along baby

I know you know that you're killing me
But its worth it just to see you smile
Tell em' to carve my name in the barstool baby
You know I'm gonna be here a while

A single strand of spider's weave
Just dancing in the sun
Please don't turn around and leave
You are my only one

I can't go on living alone now that you're gone
You done me wrong so here's your song
Now sing along
