I'd have to be crazy to stop all my singing
and never play music again
You'd call me a fool if I grabbed up my top hat
and ran out to flag down the wind
I'd have to be weird to grow me a beard
just to see what the rednecks would do
I'd have to be crazy plum out of my mind
to fall out of love with you

You know I've done weird things, told people I've heard things
When silence was all in abounds
Been days when it pleased me to crawl on my knees
following ants as they crawled across the ground
Been insane on a train but I'm still me again
and the place where I hold you is true
But I'd have to be crazy, plum out of my mind
To fall out of love with you

You know I don't intend to
But should there come a day
when I say that I don't love you
You can lock me away

Well it sure would be dingy to live in an envelope
in a world waiting along for a stamp
You'd swear I was loco to rub for a genie
while burning my hand on a lamp
I may not be normal but nobody is
so I'd like to say before I'm through
I'd have to be crazy, plum out of my mind
to fall out of love with you
