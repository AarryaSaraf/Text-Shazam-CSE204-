Never was a finer breed than the steed who was Shamrock
Plain to see by his confirmation that he came from finest stock
Daddy was black mammoth jack, mama was a thoroughbred mare
Had four white feet on a buckskin coat, blonde mohawk in his hair
Stood about 19 hands, didn't need no kick to go
With ol' Dood up top, deep in the saddle, hollering
Whoa, boy, whoa
Whoa, boy, whoa

Only ever had one rider, anyone else was gettin' bucked
Cross any kind of land, through the rain, snow, and muck
Surefooted as a billy goat, with 33 inch ears
Clog dance on a snake with his front two feet, give coyotes the rear
Kick so hard it'll send 'em up and out the stratosphere
Make a coyote fly so far, it wouldn't land until next year
From the hightop to the holler, no place Sham can't go
With ol' Dood up top, deep in the saddle, hollering
Whoa, boy, whoa
Whoa, boy, whoa

Ain't scared to cross that river, jump clear across that crick
Steed don't need no shoes when his hooves is one foot thick
Leather and tack can't hold him back, he'll bite right through a bit
Rope bridle made of mooring line was the only thing that'd fit
Hot on the bandits trail, fence posting through the snow
Ol' Dood up top, high in the saddle, hollering
Go, boy, go
Go, boy, go
Go, boy, go
Go, boy, go
