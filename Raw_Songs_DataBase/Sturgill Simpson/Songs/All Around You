There will be days
When the sun won't shine
When it seems like the whole world is against you
Don't be afraid
Life is unkind
You can let go of the pain if you choose to

Cause time slips away
Skies fall apart
Revealing to all
A universal heart
Glowing, flowing, all around you

There will be nights that go on forever
Like you're long-lost at sea
Never to be found
Just know in your heart
That we're always together
And long after I'm gone
I'll still be around

Cause our bond is eternal
And so is love
God is inside you
All around you
And up above
Glowing, showing you the way

Cause time slips away
Skies fall apart
Revealing to all
A universal heart
Glowing, flowing, all around you
