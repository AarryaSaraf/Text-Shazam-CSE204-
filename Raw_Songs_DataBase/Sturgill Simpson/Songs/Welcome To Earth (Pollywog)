Hello, my son
Welcome to earth
You may not be my last
But you'll always be my first
Wish I'd done this ten years ago
But how could I know
How could I know
That the answer was so easy
I've been told you measure a man
By how much he loves
When I hold you
I treasure each moment I spend
On this earth, under heaven above
Grandfather always said God's a fisherman
And now I know the reason why

And if some times daddy has to go away
But please don't think it means I don't love you
Oh, how I wish I could be there everyday
Cause when I'm gone it makes me so sad and blue
And holding you is the greatest love I've ever known
When I get home it breaks my heart
Seeing how much you've grown all on your own

Hearing you cry makes me cry
It made me cry
Hearing me cry
A thousand miles away
Every cry
(greatest love I've ever known)
(ever known)
