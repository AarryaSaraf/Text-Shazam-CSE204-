I been going out of my mind for a while now
Tryna find my way back home, I don't know how
Oh I'm all the way up here, in Kentucky seeing things clear
Through a haze of whiskey tears and misery
While you're all the way down there in Tennessee

I been going at it a little hard as of late it might seem
Been waking up every day in the same bad dream
Taking long walks at night, seeing things in a much bluer light
That old moon and your memory following me
'Cause you're all the way down there in Tennessee

They say in Tennessee, the sun is always shining
But this blue moon glowing on me has got me pining

I been trying to find my way back with no luck so far
And the hardest part is just knowing how close you are
Two hundred and ten mile drive, three hours down South Sixty-Five
But it feels like there's an ocean between you and me
'Cause you're all the way down there in Tennessee
