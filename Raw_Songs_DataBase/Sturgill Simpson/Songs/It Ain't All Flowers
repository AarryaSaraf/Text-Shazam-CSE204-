Cleaning out the darkest corner of my mind
Taking all my full circles, and making straight lines
Been getting to the bottom of the bottom getting to me
Been holding up the mirror to everything I don't want to see
But it ain't all flowers, sometimes you gotta feel the thorns
And when you play with the Devil you know you gonna get the horns

Been dancing with demons all my life
Every time I find my groove they cut in like a knife
Been a sin eater oh since the day I was born
Tired of feeling weighed down from carrying round all the pain that keeps me torn
So I pray when I lay me down to die
Grab a glass of wine and a seat to dine and go ahead and eat the whole damn pie

But it ain't all flowers, sometimes you gotta feel the thorns
And when you play with the Devil you know you gonna get the horns
