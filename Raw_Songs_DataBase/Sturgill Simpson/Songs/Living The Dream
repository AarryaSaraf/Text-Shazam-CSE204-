Time and time again Lord I've been going through the motion
It's a means to an end but the ends don't seem to meet
Walking around living the dream anytime I take the notion
Til the truth comes bubbling up so bittersweet

Ain't no point getting outta bed when you ain't living the dream
Like making a big old pot of coffee when you ain't got no cream
I don't need to change my strings
Cause the dirt don't hurt the way I sing
I don't have to do a Goddamn thing except sit around and wait to die

Well I've been waiting on an angel waitress to come and take my order
Tell me all about the special today
Staring at a puddle of mud in my spoon couldn't be much bolder
Hoping them circles on the paper don't call back telling me to start today

That old man upstairs, He wears a crooked smile
Staring down on the chaos he created
He said son if you ain't having fun just wait a little while
Momma's gonna wash it all away
And she thinks mercy's overrated
