Come hear a tale out of the trails of ol' Cantuckee Hills
Hear a story from the year they started hiding stills
Back in pioneering days of 1862
About a maiden named Juanita and a man called Dood

It's a story of its time
When time was tough on a man
When all he had to get by was a blade and powder can

Ol' Dood was an eagle eye, Juanita was his dove
He was a mighty mountain man
She was his one true love
