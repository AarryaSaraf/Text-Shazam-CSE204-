// Born To Hula //

Follow trails of you to here
Every mile takes you my way
Rolling faster than we can
Tables turning all the time
I'm the dog at your feet
Out of sight and out of time

You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one

Fucking have to wait a dime
Every single flinging mile
They're coming faster all the while

You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one

Ain't it something, we're born to hula
Ain't it something, we're born to hula
Ain't it something, we're born to hula
Ain't it something, we're born to hula

// 18 A.D. //

There is no yesterday
There is no tomorrow
Can't look, can't speak
Another word
As far as you know
Over and over
Clear and forgotten

Over and over
Over and over
There is no tomorrow
There is no tomorrow

// Christian Brothers //

No bad dream fucker's going to boss me around
Christian brothers gonna take him down
But it can't help me get over
Don't be cross, it's sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off

Fake concerns is what's the matter, man
And you think I ought to shake
Your motherfucking hand
Well, I know how much you care
Don't be cross, it's sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off

Come here by me, I want you here
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear

Don't be cross, it's sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off
Come here by me, I want you here
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear

// Goin' Out West //

I'm going out west where the wind blows tall
Cause Tony Franciosa used to date my ma'
They got some money out there; they're givin' it away
I'm gonna do what I want, and I'm gonna get paid
Do what I want, and I'm gonna get paid

Little brown sausages lying in the sand
I ain't no extra baby, I'm a leading man
My parole officer will be proud of me

With my Olds' '88
And the Devil on a leash
With my Olds' '88
And the Devil on a leash

I know karate, voodoo too
I'm gonna make myself available to you
I don't need no makeup
I got real scars
I got hair on my chest
I look good without a shirt on

Well, I won't loose my composure in a high-speed chase
My friends say I'm ugly, I've got a masculine face
I got some drag-strip courage
I can really drive a bed

I'm gonna change my name to Hannibal
Or maybe just Rex
Change my name to Hannibal
Or maybe just Rex

I know karate, voodoo too
I'm gonna make myself available to you
I don't need no makeup
I got real scars
I got hair on my chest
I look good without a shirt on

Drive all night, get some speed
I'm gonna wait for the sun to shine down on me
I cut a hole in my roof
The shape of a heart

And I'm going out west
Where they appreciate me
Going out west
Where they appreciate me
Going out west
Going out west

Gone

// Gonna Leave You (Spanish Version) //

Esperando tu llamada
Él no te puede ayudar

Tres años demasiado
Sabes que equivocastes
Todo marca la piel
Empujala, déjalo

Ya me voy, te voy a dejar
Ya me voy, te voy a dejar

Ya empece
Golpee tu corazón
Eso es el fin
No hay fotos, ni amigos, no más
Lloviendo en mi cuarto
Sangre en mi cuchara
Lárgate de mi asiento
Me fui de tu vida

Ya me voy, te voy a dejar
Ya me voy, te voy a dejar
Ya me voy, te voy a dejar
Ya me voy, te voy a dejar

Tres años demasiado
Sabes que equivocastes
Todo marca la piel
Empujala, déjalo

Ya me voy, te voy a dejar
Ya me voy, te voy a dejar
Ya me voy, te voy a dejar
Ya me voy, no me importas tú

// Goodbye Yellow Brick Road //

When are you going to come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man

You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you'll do then?
I bet that'll shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

// Infinity //

Got a hole in my head
Everything falls right out
Through my ears, through my eyes
Makes no difference where you are
You wanna know how I do it?
I do it all right

I got a hole and I'll never go home
There ain't nothing can fill it up
I got a hole and I'll never go home
There ain't no one thing

A new wrong
A new wrong
A new wrong
A new wrong
You never get right back
A new wrong
You never get right back
A new wrong

You wanna know how I do it?
You wanna know how I do it?
You wanna know how I do it?
I do it all right

I got a hole and I'll never go home
There ain't nothing can fill it up
I got a hole and I'll never go home
There ain't no one thing out there

Not me with a gun to my head
I can let it go
Not me with a gun to my head
I can let it go
So I sing, uhhh
