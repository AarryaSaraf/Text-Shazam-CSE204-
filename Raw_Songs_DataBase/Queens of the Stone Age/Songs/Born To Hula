Follow trails of you to here
Every mile takes you my way
Rolling faster than we can
Tables turning all the time
I'm the dog at your feet
Out of sight and out of time

You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one

Fucking have to wait a dime
Every single flinging mile
They're coming faster all the while

You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one

Ain't it something, we're born to hula
Ain't it something, we're born to hula
Ain't it something, we're born to hula
Ain't it something, we're born to hula
