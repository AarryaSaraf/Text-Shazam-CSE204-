Clear-eyed girl
In a crooked way
All the crooked walkin'
To avoid and evade
Hair like maple, skin like cream
Bet they say 'I love you'
When you strip them clean

Baby, you're so vague
Baby, you're so vague
Baby, you're so vague
That you probably think this song ain't about you

Green-eyed boys
Lick the razor blade
Girl, I think I love you (girl, I think I love you)
And the mess you made (and the mess you made)
Setting you up
It don't get you down
When you flash your fangs (Fuck!)
You own this town

Baby, you're so vague
Baby, you're so vague
Baby, you're so vague
That you probably think this song ain't about you (Ah!)

Baby, you're so vague
Baby, you're so vague
That you probably think this song ain't about you (Ah!)
Baby, you're so vague (Ah, ah)
Baby, you're so vague (Ah, ah)
You're so vague (Ah, ah)
Baby, you're so vague (Ah, ah)
Baby, you're so vague (Ah, ah)
Baby, you're so vague (Ah, ah)
Baby, you're so vague (Ah, ah)
Baby, you're so vague (Ah, ah)
