Got some action on the other side
Loose teeth in my head
New programs are coming in
So rise and take your oath
I wish we'd get away
Drink wine and screw
I knew someone else before
Looked a lot like you

And they're gone
I'm gone
In space

I've been programmed as I said before
Technology
Just rolling, wheezing and breathing
Eyeballs and teeth
Words are weightless here on Earth
Because they're free
You knew someone else before
Looked a lot like me

And they're gone
I'm gone
In space

And they're gone
I'm gone
In space
