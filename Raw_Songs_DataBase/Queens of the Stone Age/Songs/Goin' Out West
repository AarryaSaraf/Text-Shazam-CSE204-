I'm going out west where the wind blows tall
Cause Tony Franciosa used to date my ma'
They got some money out there; they're givin' it away
I'm gonna do what I want, and I'm gonna get paid
Do what I want, and I'm gonna get paid

Little brown sausages lying in the sand
I ain't no extra baby, I'm a leading man
My parole officer will be proud of me

With my Olds' '88
And the Devil on a leash
With my Olds' '88
And the Devil on a leash

I know karate, voodoo too
I'm gonna make myself available to you
I don't need no makeup
I got real scars
I got hair on my chest
I look good without a shirt on

Well, I won't loose my composure in a high-speed chase
My friends say I'm ugly, I've got a masculine face
I got some drag-strip courage
I can really drive a bed

I'm gonna change my name to Hannibal
Or maybe just Rex
Change my name to Hannibal
Or maybe just Rex

I know karate, voodoo too
I'm gonna make myself available to you
I don't need no makeup
I got real scars
I got hair on my chest
I look good without a shirt on

Drive all night, get some speed
I'm gonna wait for the sun to shine down on me
I cut a hole in my roof
The shape of a heart

And I'm going out west
Where they appreciate me
Going out west
Where they appreciate me
Going out west
Going out west

Gone
