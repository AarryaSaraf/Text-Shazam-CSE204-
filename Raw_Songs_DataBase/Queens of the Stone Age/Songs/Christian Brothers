No bad dream fucker's going to boss me around
Christian brothers gonna take him down
But it can't help me get over
Don't be cross, it's sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off

Fake concerns is what's the matter, man
And you think I ought to shake
Your motherfucking hand
Well, I know how much you care
Don't be cross, it's sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off

Come here by me, I want you here
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear

Don't be cross, it's sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off
Come here by me, I want you here
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear
Nightmares become me, it's so fucking clear
