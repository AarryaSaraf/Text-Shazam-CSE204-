But even the mob know what the hell I mean

I hate rock and roll
Some think too much, then come too soon

Don't wanna love you no more
Don't wanna love you less
I wanna be crushed by your sweet caress
What's the fucking difference? We all gonna die

Come on, give it a try

Yeah, ooo, ay
Yeah, ooo, yeah
Yeah, ooo, ah
Yeah, ooo, yeah, ah

Yeah, ooo, yeah
Yeah, ooo, yeah
Yeah, ooo, yeah
Yeah, ooo, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Hah)

There's only one line I would get
