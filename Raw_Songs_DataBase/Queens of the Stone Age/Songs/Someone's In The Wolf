Once you're lost
In twilights's blue
You don't find your way
The way finds you

Tempt the fates
Beware the smile
It hides all the teeth, my dear
What's behind them

So glad you could stay forever
So glad you could stay forever
So glad you could stay forever
So glad you could stay forever

He steps between the trees
A crooked man
There's blood on the blade
Don't take his hand

You warm by the firelight, in twilight's blue
Shadows creep and dance the walls
He's creeping too

So glad you could stay forever
So glad you could stay forever
So glad you could stay forever
So glad you could stay forever

So glad you could stay
So glad you could
So glad you could stay
So glad you could
So glad you could stay
