Every day I wake up feelin' this way
I take it downtown, with all the action goin' down
I strike a match, strike a match, cook it up!

(High life) I'm feelin' so sick
I feel so fuckin' sick
(Low life)

On the bathroom floor
Gotta get out and get right
Hustlin' little girls
Cheatin' little boys

Gotta get out
Gotta get out and get right
I gotta get out
No more!
No more!
No more!

(My life) I'm feelin' so sick on the bathroom floor
(Your life) I'm feelin' so sick
No more!

(High life, low life)
(High life, low life)
(High life, low life)
(High life) I'm feelin' so sick on the bathroom floor
(Low life) Sick... no... no more
