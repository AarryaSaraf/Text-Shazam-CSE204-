Album: TheLowHighway

// The Low Highway //

Travelin' now
On the low highway
Three thousand miles
To the Frisco Bay

Cross the rivers wild
And the lonesome plains
Up the coast and down
And back again

Saw empty houses on a dead end street
People linin up for something to eat
And the ghost of America watching me
Through the broken windows of the factories

Pickin bones of a better day
As I roll on the down the low highway

Travelin' now
On the low highway
By the yellow moon
And the light of day

From the snow white crown
Of the mountain tall
To the valley down
Where the shadows fall

Met a man with a rifle in his hand
Been away to battle in a distant land
Taught him to hate taught him to kill
Now he's out on the road with a hole to fill

Nobody knows the price he paid
So he takes his toll on the low highway

Travelin' now
On the low highway
Windows down
Listenin

Wheels turnin round
On the asphalt sayin
Every sound
Is a prophecy

Heard and old man grumble and a young girl cry
Brick wall crumble and the white dove fly
And a cry for justice and a call for peace
Force of reason in the roar of the beast

And every mile is a prayer I prayed
As I roll down
The low highway

// Calico County //

Half a case of cold pills soakin in a milk jug
Hydrochloric acid, iodine and phosphorous
Careful not get any on ya when ya shake it up
That's the way we cook it up in Calico County
Calico County

Born in a double wide out behind the county dump
Mama never told me why daddy didn't live with us
Only picture I had he's climbing on the prison bus
Stencil on his back said "Calico County"
Calico County

My little brother Bobby stole a Coca-Cola truck
Drove it through the cemetery
Bobby don't give a fuck
Thirteen tombstones fifty-seven hundred bucks
Ain't that much money in Calico County
Calico County

"Out of here some day"
Ain't that what they used to say
Army wouldn't take me so I guess I'm gonna have to stay
Friday night, dog fight
Sucking on a meth pipe 'til I lay me down to die in Calico County
Calico County
Calico County

// Burnin It Down //

'Fore I was born, there were no limitations
Said my goodbyes at the greyhound station
Here I am half a mile from where I grew up
In a parking lot sittin' in my pickup truck

And I'm thinkin' bout burnin' it down, boys
Thinkin' bout burnin' it down
Nothin's ever gonna be the same in this townâ€¦

Ten gallons of gas and a bottle of propane
I took the lighter off my grill and I still can't
Say for certain that this thing'll blow.
But if it does I'm gonna be the first one to know. 

I'm thinkin' bout burnin' it down, boys
Thinkin' bout burnin' it down
Nothin's ever gonna be the same in this town
I'm thinkin' bout burnin' the Walmart down.

Always used to say I'd come back some day and settle down.
I'm getting old. Got no place to go. It's all come unwound. 

So I'm watching' the faces comin' and goin'
Some of them strangers some that I know and
It doesn't matter how much, how long I wait.
Cause the door's always open and it's never too late.

And I'm thinkin' bout burnin' it down, boys
Thinkin' bout burnin' it down
Nothin's ever gonna be the same in this town
And I'm thinkin' bout burnin' it down, boys
Thinkin' bout burnin' it down
Nothin's ever gonna be the same in this town
I'm thinkin' bout burnin' the Walmart down.
Thinkin' bout burnin' the Walmart down.
I'm thinkin' bout burnin' it down.

// That All You Got? //

Nothin' ever comes from outta nowhere
Ain't nobody ever rides for free
There's a hundred million heartaches out there
In between the devil and the deep blue sea
And all the troubles of the wide world flow
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Here it comes again
Ready or not
Worry and pain?
That all you got?
That all you got?
Good lord wasn't playin' honey
The day that he invented New Orleans
And there ain't no amount of blood or money
Ever gonna wash the pavement clean
But everybody on the night shift knows
Might as well keep on dancin' till the next wind blows
Gonna spoil my day
Give it your best shot
Another hurricane?
That all you got?
That all you got?
Bon temps roulet
No matter what
Holler fee nah nay
That all you got?
That all you got?

// Love's Gonna Blow My Way //

I'm stranded
Standin' in the pourin' rain
Really comin' down but someday
Love's gonna blow my way
Empty-handed
Haven't got a shuck to pay
For a ticket outta town but someday
Love's gonna blow my way
People goin' places pass me by
I don't care 'cause I know I
Got plans made
And I don't need to do a thing
But stand right where I am 'cause someday
Love's gonna blow my way

I've been prayin'
Light a candle everyday
And every little prayer that I pray
Says love's gonna blow my way
So I'm just stayin'
Waitin' on the wind to change
'Cause generally all the signs say
Love's gonna blow my way
Stormy weather never brings me down
'Cause it don't ever hang around
It just fades
Into another sunny day
Shinin' down on me 'cause someday
Love's gonna blow my way

I ain't goin' nowhere I can't be
Where my true love can't follow me
So I'll wait
Takes forever that's okay
'Cause somethin' in the air says someday
Love's gonna blow my way

// After Mardi Gras //

See that shadow on the wall
Doesn't look like me at all
Head hung down
Intentions meltin' on the ground
Saddest shape I ever saw

There's so much I need to do
Before I get over you
But I can't bother with it all
Until after Mardi Gras
All that music in the air
Happy people everywhere
Make it hard to sing the blues
Until Mardi Gras is through

Put my loneliness away
Save it for a rainy day
Delay the pain
Nothin' ventured nothin' gained
The time'll come but that's okay

// Pocket Full Of Rain //

Boys out on the corner
The way they were before
But me I don't go down there
With my money anymore
Yeah I can still remember when
It used to kill the pain
But I woke up every mornin'
With a pocketful of rain

Ain't like it's been easy
I been up and down
And lately I can't seem to keep
My chin up off the ground
But I'd rather eat a pound of dirt than
Taste that taste again
And a world of hurt is better than
A pocket full of rain

Talk about the devil and up he jump
Down beside the levee on a hollow stump
Shakin' like a window girl in Amsterdam
I don't wanna be no closer than I am
To tell you he's the devil
'Cause I know all his names
And I know all his faces well
He's the devil just the same
He'll look you in the eye and lie
And promise anything
Leave you cold and empty as
A pocket full of rain

// Invisible //

There's a hole in my shoe but I don't mind
'Cause it keeps me connected to the ground when I'm
Feelin' like maybe if I ain't careful I'll just blow away
Then the lightnin' strikes, the thunder rolls and I'm OK

Everywhere I go
People pass me by
They never know cause I'm invisible
A shadow hangin' low
A footstep just behind
They carry on but I'm invisible

I'm taking my time but I ain't slow
'Cause it ain't like I got anyplace else to go
But there's ghosts in these streets and they're callin' my name
And I follow 'em down in the dark again

An angel bendin' down
To whisper in your ear
You turn around but we're invisible

A rumble underground
Your deepest darkest fear
You hear the sound but they're invisible

Brother can you spare
A dollar and a dime?
The cupboard's bare and I'm invisible
Travel anywhere
You won't ever find
A purer heart cause mine's invisible
I'm invisible

// Warren Hellman's Banjo //

I'm standin' on Jordan's shore
Standin' on Jordan's shore
And I ain't gonna worry anymore
'Cause I'm standin' on Jordan's shore
Gonna lay my purse aside
Lay my purse aside
'Cause my money's no good on the other side
Gonna lay my purse aside
Gonna carry my ol' banjo
Carry my ol' banjo
'Cause the devil won't follow wherever I go
If I carry my ol' banjo

Gonna play that shady grove
Play that shady grove
Make my pallet down soft and low
Gonna play that shady grove
Gonna play that soldier's joy
Play that soldier's joy
Flop-eared mule and the red-haired boy
Gonna play that soldier's joy
Gonna bile them cabbage down
Bile them cabbage down
'Cause the devil surely cannot stand that sound
When I bile them cabbage down

Gonna carry my ol' banjo
Carry my ol' banjo
From the mountain high to the valley low
Gonna carry my ol' banjo
Gonna carry my ol' banjo
Carry my ol' banjo
'Cause the devil won't follow wherever I go
If I carry my ol' banjo

// Down The Road Part II //

Woke up in the mornin' with the middle of nowhere blues
Nothin' in my pocket but a ticket that I can't use
Been hangin' around this town and it's startin' to show
Down the road I go

Standin' on the highway with the road burnin' through my shoes
Roll over Kerouac and tell Woody Guthrie the news
Heard it said there ain't nothin' ahead but I don't know
Down the road I go

Blowin' in the wind and flyin' like a cannonball
Never seen a city where I couldn't find a place to fall
But it's only a matter of time before I'm feelin' low
Down the road I go
Daddy was a Chevy mama was a Cadillac
I was gone as soon as I was born and I ain't been back
I'm a rounder and a friend to any old wind that blows
Down the road I go

// 21st Century Blues //

Here I am in the 21st century
I have to say it ain't as cool as I hoped it would be
No man on the moon, nobody on Mars
Where the hell is my flying car?
Ain't nothing even like a teletransporter so far

It's hard times in the new millenium
Gettin' by on just the bare minimum
Everything to lose and nothing to spare
Going to hell and nobody cares
Ain't the future that Kennedy promised me
In the 21st century

Finally come to the age of Aquarius
And if we live through the Mayan apocalypse
There'll be pie in the sky above lemonade springs
A goddamn American utopian dream
If you believe that then you're more optimistic than me

Lights out in the heart of America
No love in a time of hysteria
It's head for the hills, every man for himself
Nobody helping out nobody else
Ain't the way that the Maharishi said it would be
In the 21st century

Pray for guidance, beg forgiveness
Vote for change and hope they find this
Only thing I know for sure is:
We stand now on the verge of history
The world can be anything that we want it to be

Where there's a will, there's a way
When there's a fire, there's a spark
Out in the streets, downtown in the park
Baby, the future's just waitin' on you and me
In the 21st century

In the 21st century

// Remember Me //

Here we are sittin' in the warm sunshine
I'm holdin' your tiny hand in mine
And god know's it ain't gonna be any time
Before you're grown
But I wasn't young when you come along
And chances are long before that day comes
My time in this sweet ol' world'll be done
And I'll be gone

You're lookin' at me I'm lookin' at you
And it's everything a grown man can do
Not to break down and cry like a fool
When you smile at me
I can only that hope I do my best
With whatever time that we got left
And when everything's done and said
You'll remember me

Remember me on some sunny day
When everything's goin' your way
'Cause on the day you were born I prayed
That's the way it would be
Remember me on a stormy night
When there's no sign of shelter in sight
And you soldier on through to the light
'Cause that's all you see
Remember me

You got angels watchin' over you
And your mama don't suffer fools
And there ain't nothin' that she wouldn't do for you
I don't believe
But there'll come a day when you're all alone
And you'll have to stand up on your own
And when it's muscle and blood and bone
Remember me
