Here I am again, now, acting like a crazy fool
Every time I get to rockin', I always run into you
I never did understand why you want to be so cruel

Well, Annie, is tonight the night?
Do you think the moon is right?
You don't have to tell me you will
Just say that you might

I know you told me once
I guess you coulda told me twice
I guess I keep hopin' some day you're gonna treat me nice
I'm tryin' to get next to you
Cold as ice

Well, Annie, is tonight the night?
Do you think the moon is right?
You don't have to tell me you will
Just say that you might

Now I'm not fool enough thinkin' I'm the only one
Got me comin' and a-goin' 'till I'm about to come undone
Not tryin' to find love
I'm lookin' for a little fun

Well, Annie, is tonight the night?
Do you think the moon is right?
You don't have to tell me you will
Just say that you might

Well, Annie, is tonight the night?
Do you think the moon is right?
You don't have to tell me you will
Just say that you might
