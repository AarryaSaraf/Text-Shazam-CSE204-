Come on pretty baby won't you take me by the hand
I thought maybe that I could be your man
And for a while - we could go in style
Come on we're goin' on an outlaw's honeymoon

I gotta keep movin' 'cause baby I'm a travelin' man
And there ain't a lotta women out there that understand
But if you do - I'll be good to you
Come on we're goin' on an outlaw's honeymoon

Goin' up the country - honey, don't you wanna go?
Gotta little money all you gotta do is let me know
I know a place we could disappear without a trace
Come on we're goin' on an outlaw's honeymoon
