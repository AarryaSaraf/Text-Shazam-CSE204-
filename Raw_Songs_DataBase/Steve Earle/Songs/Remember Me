Here we are sittin' in the warm sunshine
I'm holdin' your tiny hand in mine
And god know's it ain't gonna be any time
Before you're grown
But I wasn't young when you come along
And chances are long before that day comes
My time in this sweet ol' world'll be done
And I'll be gone

You're lookin' at me I'm lookin' at you
And it's everything a grown man can do
Not to break down and cry like a fool
When you smile at me
I can only that hope I do my best
With whatever time that we got left
And when everything's done and said
You'll remember me

Remember me on some sunny day
When everything's goin' your way
'Cause on the day you were born I prayed
That's the way it would be
Remember me on a stormy night
When there's no sign of shelter in sight
And you soldier on through to the light
'Cause that's all you see
Remember me

You got angels watchin' over you
And your mama don't suffer fools
And there ain't nothin' that she wouldn't do for you
I don't believe
But there'll come a day when you're all alone
And you'll have to stand up on your own
And when it's muscle and blood and bone
Remember me
