See that shadow on the wall
Doesn't look like me at all
Head hung down
Intentions meltin' on the ground
Saddest shape I ever saw

There's so much I need to do
Before I get over you
But I can't bother with it all
Until after Mardi Gras
All that music in the air
Happy people everywhere
Make it hard to sing the blues
Until Mardi Gras is through

Put my loneliness away
Save it for a rainy day
Delay the pain
Nothin' ventured nothin' gained
The time'll come but that's okay
