Everybody's out to get me
See it in their eyes
Hardly see the way they look at me
When I go cruisin' by

Cadillac, Cadillac
I'm a Coupe de Ville built for thrill
Cadillac

I got chrome everywhere I need it
Rolled and pleated front to back
If you don't think I got it made
You ought to see me dressed in black

Cadillac, Cadillac
I'm a Coupe de Ville built for thrill
Cadillac

Now, if you've got a woman
There's one thing for sure
If you want to keep her
You best keep her from my door

Cadillac, Cadillac
I'm a Coupe de Ville built for thrill
Cadillac

Cadillac

Oh, Cadillac
