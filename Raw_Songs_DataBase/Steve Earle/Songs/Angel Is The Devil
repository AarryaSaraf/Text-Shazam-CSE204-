Everybody call her angel
She's no stranger to the devil I know
His mark is on her body
His fire's burnin' in her soul
When we're makin' love
He's laughin' at us down below
She's the devil I know


She's the devil I know
She's the devil I know
Said she come from heaven
Angel is the devil I know
She's the devil I know

Now she's the kind a woman
Keep you comin' back for more
Got the kind of face
You swear you seen someplace before
Coulda been your mamma
Coulda been a Mexican whore
She's the devil I know

Now she'd drag you straight to hell
I can tell and I think I'll just go
Yeah the devil sent her here
To deliver me body and soul
Yeah and every inch she drags me down
I'm closer to the glow
She`s the devil I know
