Ooh pretty baby what you doin' to me
The way your kisses burn right through me
I don't think I can last much longer
I get weaker and my love gets stronger
I don't think that my heart can take it
One little slip of a word might break it
Well believe me baby this ain't no crush
I think maybe I love you too much
Baby, baby, baby, oh baby, ooh baby, baby, I love you too much
Baby, baby, baby, oh baby, ooh baby, baby, I love you too much

I tell myself that it ain't no big thing
Then you give another little tug on that heart string
Well you cut me girl and I'm still bleedin'
Well just touch me baby, that's all I'm needin'
You must think that I'm easy, don't ya
But I got scars that I've never shown ya
Well every inch of me burns for your touch
I think maybe I love you too much
