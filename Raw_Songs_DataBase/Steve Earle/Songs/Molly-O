In the shadow of a chestnut tree I hide 
sword and a pistol by my side 
long come a traveler - lay him low 
all for the love of my Molly-O 
I left my family left my home 
out in the wicked world to roam 
no road so low I won't go down
for the love of my Molly-O 

Oh Molly
Oh Molly
Oh Molly 
All for the love of my Molly-O

I love Molly, God only knows
Molly love diamonds, pearls and gold
Bangles, Beads and Bells I bring
But Molly won't wear no wedding ring

Men have died for lesser things
Vengeance, Country, God and King
Someday I'll swing from the gallows pole
A final dance for my Molly-O
