I'm standin' on Jordan's shore
Standin' on Jordan's shore
And I ain't gonna worry anymore
'Cause I'm standin' on Jordan's shore
Gonna lay my purse aside
Lay my purse aside
'Cause my money's no good on the other side
Gonna lay my purse aside
Gonna carry my ol' banjo
Carry my ol' banjo
'Cause the devil won't follow wherever I go
If I carry my ol' banjo

Gonna play that shady grove
Play that shady grove
Make my pallet down soft and low
Gonna play that shady grove
Gonna play that soldier's joy
Play that soldier's joy
Flop-eared mule and the red-haired boy
Gonna play that soldier's joy
Gonna bile them cabbage down
Bile them cabbage down
'Cause the devil surely cannot stand that sound
When I bile them cabbage down

Gonna carry my ol' banjo
Carry my ol' banjo
From the mountain high to the valley low
Gonna carry my ol' banjo
Gonna carry my ol' banjo
Carry my ol' banjo
'Cause the devil won't follow wherever I go
If I carry my ol' banjo
