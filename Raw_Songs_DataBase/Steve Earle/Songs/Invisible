There's a hole in my shoe but I don't mind
'Cause it keeps me connected to the ground when I'm
Feelin' like maybe if I ain't careful I'll just blow away
Then the lightnin' strikes, the thunder rolls and I'm OK

Everywhere I go
People pass me by
They never know cause I'm invisible
A shadow hangin' low
A footstep just behind
They carry on but I'm invisible

I'm taking my time but I ain't slow
'Cause it ain't like I got anyplace else to go
But there's ghosts in these streets and they're callin' my name
And I follow 'em down in the dark again

An angel bendin' down
To whisper in your ear
You turn around but we're invisible

A rumble underground
Your deepest darkest fear
You hear the sound but they're invisible

Brother can you spare
A dollar and a dime?
The cupboard's bare and I'm invisible
Travel anywhere
You won't ever find
A purer heart cause mine's invisible
I'm invisible
