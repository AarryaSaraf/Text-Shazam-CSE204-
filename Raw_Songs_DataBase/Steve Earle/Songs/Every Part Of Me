I love you with all my heart
All my soul, every part of me
It's all I can do to mark
Where you end and where I start you see

Labored long in my travails, I left a trail of tears behind me
Been in love so many times
Didn't think this kind
Would ever find me

I love you with everything, all my weakness
All my strength
I can't promise anything except that my last breath
Will bear your name

And when I'm gone they'll sing a song
About a lonely fool who wandered around the world and back again
But in the end he finally found her

I love you with all my heart
All my soul and every part of me

Across the universe I'll spin until the end and then I wonder
If we should get another chance
Could I have that dance forever under
A double moon and scarlet stars shining down on where you are

And I love you with all my heart
All my soul and every part of me
