Somewhere out there in the world tonight
Just out of my reach
I hear your heart beat
Comin' in loud and clear tonight
Poundin' in my brain
Callin' out your name
In the darkness something binds you to me
So that I can find you
When you want me
I will be there
Waiting on you
Somewhere out there

In there in your heart tonight
Where I have never gone
You are not alone
It is tearing me all apart alright
But girl what can I do
When I'm so far from you

And when I lay me down to sleep
My one and only prayer is you'll keep
Safe from harm until I get
Wherever you are
Somewhere out there

If you're sad or if you're lonely
If you're scared, if you're only
Tired of fightin'
Seekin' shelter
Just hold on I'm
Somewhere out there

Somewhere out there in the world tonight
Just out of your reach
You'll hear my heart beat
