I had a melancholy malady 
Went to see the doctor and the doctor say 
Too bad, nothin' he could do 
He knew a man in Louisiana if I'm willin' to pay 
Laid my money on the barrelhead 

Man behind the bar began to shimmy and shake 
Can't lie, I reckoned I was dead 
When he picked my money up and I heard him say 
Meet me in the alleyway minute to midnight 
Don't be late meet me in the alleyway 
Better come runnin' the spirits won't wait 
Thirteen tiger teeth in my talisman 
St. John the Conqueror and a black cat bone 
Been seen walkin' with the guardians 
Now I'm in the alley and I'm all alone 
Can't run, can't hide from destiny 
Knew this day was callin' nearly all of my life 
Been done ain't the only boy from Tennessee 
To carve his name in cypress with a jawbone knife 

So you wanna be the king of America 
Say you wanna know the oracle's mind 
Say you wanna see the Marquesses of Mardi Gras 
dancin' with the devil at the end of the line
