I was born in the city
I was born in the city
And I was raised up right around here
Daddy's down in the workhouse
Daddy's down in the workhouse
Daddy's down in the workhouse
Mama say ain't no way he's coming back here
Went to school with some rich kids
Went to school with some rich kids
Went to school with some rich kids
Bussed me half way across town
Call us white trash and no count
Call us white trash and no count
Call us white trash and no count
Say there wasn't no use in me staying round
I'm goin' down to the corner
I'm goin' down to the corner
I'm goin' down to the corner
Don't you wait for me to come in
Nothin' happens till midnight
Nothin' ever happens till midnight
Nothin' happens till midnight
The boys get restless bout then
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
I got a razor in my pocket
I got a razor in my pocket
I got a razor in my pocket and
I got a pistol hid down by the school
Lord get me out of West Nashville
Lord get me out of West Nashville
Lord get me out of West Nashville
Lord get me out of West Nashville
