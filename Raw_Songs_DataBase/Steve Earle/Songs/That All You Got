Nothin' ever comes from outta nowhere
Ain't nobody ever rides for free
There's a hundred million heartaches out there
In between the devil and the deep blue sea
And all the troubles of the wide world flow
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Here it comes again
Ready or not
Worry and pain?
That all you got?
That all you got?
Good lord wasn't playin' honey
The day that he invented New Orleans
And there ain't no amount of blood or money
Ever gonna wash the pavement clean
But everybody on the night shift knows
Might as well keep on dancin' till the next wind blows
Gonna spoil my day
Give it your best shot
Another hurricane?
That all you got?
That all you got?
Bon temps roulet
No matter what
Holler fee nah nay
That all you got?
That all you got?
