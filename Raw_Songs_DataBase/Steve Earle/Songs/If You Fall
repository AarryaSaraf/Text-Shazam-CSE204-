I saw you lookin' at that girl like that
I saw her too boy I know right where you're at
But you better be careful
'Cause she ain't the kind you're gonna forget
How much you wanna bet


If you fall in love
Nothin's gonna be the same
You walk around callin' out her name
Throw your heart down like a glove
Push comes to shove
You only end up lonely and blue
Whenever she's away from you If you fall in love

You gotta hear me talkin' to ya
'Cause I'm your best friend
And I'd hate to see you goin'
Where I've already been
'Cause I've been in love before
And I won't ever be the same again
You better listen to me, Jim



There she is again
She sure looks fine
Boy, I know you're walkin'
On a very thin line
So I guess it's up to me
'Cause your heart's not as strong as mine
Well just this one time
