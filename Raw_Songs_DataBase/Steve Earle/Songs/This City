This city won't wash away 
This city won't ever drown 
Blood in the water and hell to pay 
Sky tear open and pain rain down 
Doesn't matter 'cause come what may 
I ain't ever gonna leave this town 
This city won't wash away 
This city won't ever drown 
Ain't the river or the wind to blame 
Everybody around here knows 
Nothin' holdin' back Ponchartrain 
Except for a prayer and a promise's ghost 
We just carry on diggin' our graves 
In solid marble above the ground 
Maybe our bones'll wash away 
But this city won't ever drown 
This city won't ever die 
Just as long as her heart beats strong 
Like a second line steppin' high 
Raisin' hell as we roll along 
Gentilly to the Vieux Carre 
Lower Nine, Central City, Uptown 
Singin' Jacamo fee-nah-nay 
This city won't ever drown 
Doesn't matter cause there ain't no way 
I'm ever gonna leave this town 
This city won't wash away 
This city won't ever drown
