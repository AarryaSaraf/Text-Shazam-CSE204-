I'm stranded
Standin' in the pourin' rain
Really comin' down but someday
Love's gonna blow my way
Empty-handed
Haven't got a shuck to pay
For a ticket outta town but someday
Love's gonna blow my way
People goin' places pass me by
I don't care 'cause I know I
Got plans made
And I don't need to do a thing
But stand right where I am 'cause someday
Love's gonna blow my way

I've been prayin'
Light a candle everyday
And every little prayer that I pray
Says love's gonna blow my way
So I'm just stayin'
Waitin' on the wind to change
'Cause generally all the signs say
Love's gonna blow my way
Stormy weather never brings me down
'Cause it don't ever hang around
It just fades
Into another sunny day
Shinin' down on me 'cause someday
Love's gonna blow my way

I ain't goin' nowhere I can't be
Where my true love can't follow me
So I'll wait
Takes forever that's okay
'Cause somethin' in the air says someday
Love's gonna blow my way
