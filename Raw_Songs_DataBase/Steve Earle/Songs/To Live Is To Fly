Won't say I love you, babe
Won't say I need you, babe
I'm gonna get you babe
And I will not do you wrong

Living's mostly wasting time
I'll waste my share of mine
But it never feels too good
So let's don't take too long

Well you're soft as glass
And I'm a gentleman
We got the sky to talk about
And the world to lie upon

Days up and down they come
Like rain on a conga drum
Forget most, remember some
Don't turn none away

Everything is not enough
And nothin' is too much to bear
Where you've been is good and gone
All you keep's the getting there

Well to live is to fly, all low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes

It's goodbye to all my friends
It's time to go again
But think of all the poetry
And the pickin' down the line

Well I'll miss the system here
The bottom's low and the treble's clear
But it don't pay to think to much
On things you leave behind

Well I may be gone
But it won't be long
I will be a bringin' back the melodies
And rhythm that I find

We all got holes to fill
And them holes are all that's real
Some fall on you like a storm
Sometimes you dig your own

The choice is yours to make
And time is yours to take
Some dive into the sea
Some toil upon the stone

Well to live is to fly, all low and high
So shake the dust off of your wings
And the sleep out of your eyes
Shake the dust off of your wings
And the tears out of your eyes
