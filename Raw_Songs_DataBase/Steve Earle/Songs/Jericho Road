I was walkin'
Walkin' down the Jericho road
And every mile that I traveled showed
And I'm walkin' down the Jericho road
I just kept on walkin'
Walkin' down the Jericho road
And the sun set red over fields of gold
And I'm walkin' down the Jericho road
Well Joshua fit the battle, that's how the story goes
And the walls come a-tumb-a-lin' down I know
But I'm still walkin'
Walkin' down the Jericho road

I met my mother walkin' down the Jericho road
Tears in her eyes and her head hung low
And she was walkin' down the Jericho road
I met my father walkin' down the Jericho road
His back bent over from a heavy load
And he was walkin' down the Jericho road
I said "Papa, don't you know me? Won't you lay your burden down?"
He just shook his head and told me "Son, you better turn around"
And he kept on walkin'
Walkin' down the Jericho road

I met my brother walkin' down the Jericho road
And his hands were bloody but his face was clean
And he was walkin' down the Jericho road
I met my sister walkin' down the Jericho road
With a babe in her arms that I'd never seen
And she was walkin' down the Jericho road
She said "It's just a little orphan child I found along the way
I'll raise him as my own and he'll forgive us all someday"
And she kept on walkin'
Walkin' down the Jericho road

I met my mother
I met my father
I met my brother
I met my sister
