Cocaine cannot kill my pain
Like a freight train through my vein
Cocaine cannot kill my pain
Whiskey got no hold on me
Left them chains in Tennessee
Whiskey got no hold on me

Don't come knockin' on my door
Even that won't work no more
Don't come knockin' on my door

Heroin is the only thing
The only gift the darkness brings
Heroin is the only thing

Guess you'd best leave me alone
At least until these blues have gone
Guess you'd best leave me alone
