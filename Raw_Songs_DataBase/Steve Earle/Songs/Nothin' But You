Daddy used to tell me "Don't you drag your feet"
"Never seen a good intention that a man could eat"
Well, I got about a million things I need to do
I don't wanna think about nothin' but you

Everybody talk about Maybellene
Yellow Rose Of Texas and the Sweet Sixteen
Well, I don't wanna hear about no Peggy Sue
I don't wanna think about nothin' but you

I don't need no money, no fancy car
House up on the hill where all the rich folks are
Well, they can have the whiskey, keep the cocaine, too
I don't wanna think about nothin' but you

Everybody talk about Maybellene
Yellow Rose Of Texas and the Sweet Sixteen
Well, I don't wanna hear about no Peggy Sue
I don't wanna think about nothin' but you

Everybody talk about Maybellene
Yellow Rose Of Texas and the Sweet Sixteen
Well, I don't wanna hear about no Peggy Sue
I don't wanna think about nothin' but you
