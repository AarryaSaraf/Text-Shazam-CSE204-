Take your red dress, leave the hanger
Lose the sadness, use the anger
You might need it 'fore you get there


Oh, Amanda
You don't have to say goodbye
You just go Amanda
Ain't no way you didn't try
Wo, oh
All right

Tell your sister, tell your brother
Take a picture to your mother
You've been livin' undercover






Oh, Amanda
Oh, Amanda
