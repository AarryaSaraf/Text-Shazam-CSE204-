Back in the hills when we were only kids
Love shined like a diamond in your eyes
I swore I'd never hurt you - then I did
Now I'm all alone with all my lies
I promised that I'd never be untrue
I'd never make you cry
The only promise that I didn't break
Was to love you until the day I die

I wish I'd never seen those city lights
A sight for a country boy to see
For every one that you see shinin' bright
Another is burnin' out like me
I wouldn't listen though you told me dear
I couldn't see the lie
But all the same I still love you tonight
And I'll love you until the day I die

They built this prison just for fools like me
Who don't know a treasure from a stone
I killed a man now I won't ever see
The green rollin' hills where I was born
No I won't ever see your face again
But if I close my eyes
I can almost hear you call me back to then
And I'll love you until the day I die
