I'm rollin' down a blacktop highway
Hole in my chest cause my heart's in your hands
I know it ain't OK but I can't stop wantin' you
I do the best that I can
I'm starin' in a highbeam headlight
Burnin' your name on the back of my brain
I swear I hear you callin'
I might have to turn around 
Cause I'm goin' insane

I love you baby but i just can't tell 
This kinda love comes from heaven or hell 
Heaven or hell 
Heaven or hell 

New moon against a long dark midnight blue 
ain't a star any brighter than you 
I look in your eyes and I see that spark inside 
and it's all I can do to keep tellin' myself 
there ain't no way you're gonna do me like you did then
I'm standin' my ground on feet of clay
Oh no, here I go again

There ain't nothing nobody can do
There ain't nothing nobody can say
Get down on their knees and pray
OOH
