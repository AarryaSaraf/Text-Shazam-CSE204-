Way out yonder, where the wild wind blows
There's a place there lonely fools can go
Where if you hold your money, it'll burn your hand
So you buy you a ticket to the shadowland


Down the highway, down the road I'm bound
And my heart keeps poundin' and the wheels go 'round
And it's a hard place for a mortal man
And a heartbroke pilgrim in the shadowland

Yeah, when I was younger I could hold my own
My right hand was thunder and my left was stone
Now I ain't as handsome as I was back then
So I'm takin' my chances in the shadowland



Been down a thousand highways and they're all the same
Another empty place where I can hide my shame
And there's a heartache waitin' up around the bend
For a lonesome stranger in the shadowland
