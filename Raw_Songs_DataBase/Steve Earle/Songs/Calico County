Half a case of cold pills soakin in a milk jug
Hydrochloric acid, iodine and phosphorous
Careful not get any on ya when ya shake it up
That's the way we cook it up in Calico County
Calico County

Born in a double wide out behind the county dump
Mama never told me why daddy didn't live with us
Only picture I had he's climbing on the prison bus
Stencil on his back said "Calico County"
Calico County

My little brother Bobby stole a Coca-Cola truck
Drove it through the cemetery
Bobby don't give a fuck
Thirteen tombstones fifty-seven hundred bucks
Ain't that much money in Calico County
Calico County

"Out of here some day"
Ain't that what they used to say
Army wouldn't take me so I guess I'm gonna have to stay
Friday night, dog fight
Sucking on a meth pipe 'til I lay me down to die in Calico County
Calico County
Calico County
