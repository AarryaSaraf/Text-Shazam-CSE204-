My baby sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
My baby sparkle and shine
And everyone knows she's fine
She blesses all that she sees
A toss of her hair and a kiss in the breeze
But she don't love no one but me
And I can't believe she's mine

Shimmering she moves
Sunlight all around her
Even when she's blue
Silver clouds surround her

My baby sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
My baby sparkle and shine
And I can't believe she's mine

My baby swings down the street
Big tall high heel shoes on her feet
Walks by and my heart skips a beat
And I'm stumblin' like a fool
She give me somethin' so sweet
I can't sleep y'all and I can't eat
Sparks fly whenever we meet
I'm breathless 'cause she's so cool

Anywhere she goes
I can only follow
She'll be there I know
When I awake tomorrow

My baby sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
My baby sparkle and shine
And everyone knows she's fine

My baby sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
My baby sparkle and shine
And everyone knows she's fine

And everyone knows she's mine
