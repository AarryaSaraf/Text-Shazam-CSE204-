I went downtown, it was just to ease my pain
I ended up out walkin' in the rain
I took my pistol and a hundred dollar bill
I had everything I needed to get me killed

Southside girls, they suit me just fine
As long as I got money they don't whine

The devil lives on Lewis Street I swear
I seen him rockin' in his rockin' chair

I start way up top of Lewis Street
And I walk down to the end
I start way up top and I walk down to the end
I go way down in the bottoms
And I come back up again

Now Mama told me, Papa too
They both talked 'til they turned blue
But I got them ol' South Nashville blues again
I won't be satisfied until they lock me up again
