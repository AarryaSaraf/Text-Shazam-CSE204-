Since you left me baby I've been true to you
I don't run around with every gal in town
The way I used to do
I'm startin' over new
Yours forever blue

I wrote you a letter and every word was true
I apologized for all my lies
And the way I treated you
Signed it "lonely fool"
Yours forever blue

Lately I've been hurtin' deep inside of me
My poor heart's broke and every ragged stroke
Brings back your memory
Keeps me wantin' you
Yours forever blue

But I don't need no doctor to tell me what to do
'Bout this spell of yours 'cause there ain't no cure
Even if I wanted to
Can't get over you
Yours forever blue

If you ever want me you know what to do
Just call my name 'cause I ain't ashamed
To crawl on home to you
If you want me to
Yours forever blue

I'm gonna buy myself a guitar
Any kind'll do
The only song I know play it soft and low
While I moan the blues for you
The whole night through
Yours forever blue
