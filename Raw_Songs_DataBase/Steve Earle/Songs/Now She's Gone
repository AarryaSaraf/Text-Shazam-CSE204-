She was her daddy's little darlin'
Her mama's only child
They didn't understand at all when
She took to running wild
She left town one day and never said goodbye
Left a hole in daddy's lap and a tear in mama's eye
Where'd we go wrong and now she's gone
She met a boy up in Kentucky
Charlie was his name
Just when he thought he got lucky
She stole his watch and chain

She always kept on movin' and she never wasted time
And they said she left quite a string of broken hearts behind
Woke up alone and now she's gone

Me, I wasn't even trying
You could say I was content
She went through my life like lightning
Blew out the other end

I still taste her kisses, smell her perfume in the wind
And if I could you know that I would do it all again
She done me wrong, and now she's gone
