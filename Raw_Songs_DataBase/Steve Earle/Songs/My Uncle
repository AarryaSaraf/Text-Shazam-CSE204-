A letter came today from my draft board
With trembling hands I read the questionnaire
It asked a lot of questions 'bout my mamma and poppa
That ain't exactly what I call fair


So I'm headed for the nearest foreign border
Vancouver might be just my kind of town
'Cause they ain't got the kind of law and order
That tends to keep a good man underground

A sad old soldier once told me a story
About a battlefield that he was on
He said a man should never fight for glory
I guess he knows what's right and what is wrong



Now I don't know how much I owe my uncle
I expect that it's more than I can pay
He's asking me to sign a three year contract
I guess I'll catch the next bus out today
