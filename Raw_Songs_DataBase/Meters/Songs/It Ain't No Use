Ain't no use to cut you loose
I wouldn't last a day
Ain't no use to cut you loose
I guess I'm here to stay

I could think of a thousand reasons
For me to leave you
But I know if I ever walked out that door
I wouldn't know what to do

Ain't no use to cut you loose
I wouldn't last a day
(Ain't no use, ain't no use)
Ain't no use, oh, to cut you loose
I guess I'm here to stay
(Ain't no use, ain't no use)

You got me where you want me (Want me)
I'm shackled to your love (To your love)
Set me free, set me free, set me free, set me free
Set me free now

You got me where you want me (Where you want me)
I'm shackled to your love (To your love)
Set me free, set me free, set me free, set me free
Set me free now

You got me where you want me (Where you want me)
I'm shackled to your love (To your love)
Set me free, set me free, set me free, set me free
Set me free

(Ain't no use, ain't no use)
Oh, I'm goin' out of my mind
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
What I wanna do
(Ain't no use, ain't no use)
(Ain't no use, ain't no use)

Just ain't no use, I know I can't cut you loose
(Ain't no use, ain't no use)
(Ain't no use, ain't no use)
I wanna go, I wanna stay, I wanna go, I wanna stay
Don't know what I wanna do now
(Ain't no use, ain't no use)
