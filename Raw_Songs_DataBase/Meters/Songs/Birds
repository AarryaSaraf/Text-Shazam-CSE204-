Lover, there will be another one
Ooh lover, over you, beneath the sun
Tomorrow see the things that never come
Today

When you see me fly away without you
Shadow all the things you know
Feathers fall around you
And show you the way to go
It's over
It's over

Nestle in my arms, my little one
A special morning brings another sun
Tomorrow see the things that never come
Today, yeah

When you see my fly away without you
Shadow all the things you know
Feathers fall around you
Oh and show you the way to go
It's over
It's over

When you see me fly away without you
Shadow all the things you know
Feathers fall around you
Oh and show you the way to go
It's over
It's over
Can't you see it's all over?
