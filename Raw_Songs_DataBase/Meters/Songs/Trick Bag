Twelve o' clock at night
You walked out doors
You told me baby
You were gone to the drug-store

Momma in my mind
I knew you was lying
'Cause the drug-store closed at a quarter to nine
Said I saw you and Willy 'cross the fence
I heard you telling Willy
I ain't got no sense
The way you've been acting is such a drag
You tryna put me in a trick bag

Walked in my front door
I heard my back door slam
I peeped out my window
Somebody's taking it on the lam
Now we had a fight
Momma you got mad
You jumped on the telephone
Called your mom and dad
They come running down
With big old bats in their hands
Told me don't you hit the girl no more
Don't you understand?

But I saw her kissing Willy y'all
'Cross the fence, tried to tell him
Heard her telling Willy
I ain't got no sense
The way she's been acting is such a drag
She tryna put me in a trick bag

You give me wrong
Momma, I know I'm right
No it wasn't I now
That started the fight
"But she's my daughter
And I'm her pa
And you ain't nothing
But a no-good son-in-law"

But I saw her kissing Willy
'Cross the fence
I heard her telling Willy
I ain't got no sense
Hey the way she's been acting is such a drag
She done put me in a trick bag
