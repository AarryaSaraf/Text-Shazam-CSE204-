Stop that train I'm leaving
Stop that train I'm leaving
Stop that train I'm leaving
No, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
No, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

All my life I've been a lonely man
Teaching my people who don't understand
And even though I've tried my best
I still get find no happiness

Stop that train I'm leaving
Stop that train I'm leaving
Stop that train I'm leaving
No, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
No, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

Some goin' east
Some goin' west
Some step aside to try their best
Some livin' big
But the most is livin' small
They just can't even find
No food at all

Stop that train I'm leaving
Stop that train I'm leaving
Stop that train I'm leaving
No, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
No, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

Stop that train I'm leaving...
