Give it what you can while you still can give it
Give it what you can (can)
Give it what you can 'cause you gotta live with it
Give it what you can (can)

In every situation there's a good and bad
The world's sitting right on the ledge
We gotta keep our eyes wide open
And hope we don't fall off the edge
Living in a world that don't look confusin'
Grabbed all the food we eat
Better tradition is just an illusion
Askin' is better than need

Give it what you can while you still can give it
Give it what you can (can)
Give it what you can 'cause you gotta live with it
Give it what you can (can)

Time is hard, a dollar ain't nothing
And nothing in the world is free
Trying to unlock the answer to living
But you keep throwing away the key
Love yourself and hate your brother
Is a well-known matter of fact
We keep on trying to get rid of this hate
But it keeps on coming back

Give it what you can while you still can give it
Give it what you can (can)
Give it what you can 'cause you gotta live with it
Give it what you can (can)
Give it what you can while you still can give it
Give it what you can (can)
Give it what you can 'cause you gotta live with it
Give it what you can (can)

Just gotta find a way, shake this feeling (oh)
Bad news, following another day
Makes me feel like (oh)

Bad news, bad news
Bad news, sad news
Coming round the corner
Good news, glad news
Forget all the hate
(Gimme) bad news
(Gimme what you can) sad news
(Gimme what you can, can) coming round the corner
(Gimme) good news
(Gimme what you can) glad news
(Gimme what you can, can) forget all the hate
(Gimme) bad news
(Gimme what you can) sad news
(Gimme what you can, can) coming round the corner
(Gimme) good news
(Gimme what you can) glad news
(Gimme what you can, can) forget all the hate

Time is hard, a dollar ain't nothing
And nothing in the world is free
Trying to unlock the answer to living
But you keep throwing away the key
Love yourself and hate your brother
Is a well-known matter of fact
We keep on trying to get rid of this hate
But it keeps on coming back

Give it what you can while you still can give it
Give it what you can (can)
Give it what you can 'cause you gotta live with it
Give it what you can (can)
Give it what you can while you still can give it
Give it what you can (can)
Give it what you can 'cause you gotta live with it
Give it what you can (can)

(Gimme) bad news
(Gimme what you can) sad news
(Gimme what you can, can) coming round the corner
(Gimme) good news
(Gimme what you can) glad news
(Gimme what you can, can) forget all the hate
