The touch of your lips, baby, next to mine
You make me excited, and you make me feel fine
The touch of your hand, your sweet hello
And the fire inside you when you're holding me close
It's your love so warm and tender
God knows the thrill is so divine
It is all these things, yeah, that make you mine

If you would leave, lord, I know, I'm gonna die
Cause when you were ten minutes late mine, you don't know if what you make a grown man cry
And I've got it bad, but that's alright
Just as long as you're near me every night
Cause it's your love, it's so warm and tender
Girl, the thrill, thrill, oh, is so divine
It is all these things, my baby, that make you mine
Say you gonna be mine
I just love you, lord, I love you, lord knows, I love you, yeah
Baby... why... can't you see, I love you...
