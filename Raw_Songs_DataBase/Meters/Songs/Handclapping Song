A little softer, people get down low
A little softer, people get softer
A little softer, people get down low

A little louder, people get louder
A little louder, people get louder

Clap your hands now, people clap now
Clap your hands now, people clap your hands
Clap your hands now, people clap now
Clap your hands now, people clap your hands
