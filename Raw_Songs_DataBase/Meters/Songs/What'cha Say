Keeping my mind to the sky
Watching the clouds pass me by, by
Soaring ever so high
And I can't come down

This way to go where to turn
Passing more time just to burn, burn
Keeping if I should turn
Straight to your heart

Follow my steps I'm delayed
Selfishness always betray
Sometimes there must be a change
And I changed

If I think of a way to express my love
Would you think of a way to receive
If I gave you myself for the rest of my days
Would you promise never to leave

Keep on, keep on, get high
On your love
Keep on, keep on, get high
On your love
Keep on, keep on, get high
On your love
Keep on, keep on, get high
On your love

Hey, hey, hey
What'cha, what'cha say
Hey, hey, hey
What'cha, what'cha say
Hey, hey, hey
What'cha, what'cha say
Hey, hey, hey
What'cha, what'cha say
...
