If I had one wish, for Christmas this year
There'd be no more sorrow, there'd be no pain or tear
If it was up to me... Darling I would beheld you a world of love...
Haa... oohh
Haa... oohh

Listen now
We would gather round that... that big Christmas tree
And we'd sing a song together
We wouldn't have no worries, except for the weather
Watch the snow fall
Go hang some mistletoe... yo... the world of love

Let me tell you something
Every man would see, what the true spirit means
Peace on earth and love and joy
Each one teach one
That way everybody reach one
All the babies every girl and boy must have a toy to play with

Oh... don't you have no worries
Just for this one day now
Well then maybe the whole world just might
Maybe we might find a way to make this feeling last
All year round
Don't you ever let the children down... listen to me now
Whether you agnostic, muslim, christian, or jew
Children of the world, they dependin' on you
Let me say it again
It don't matter if you're black, your white, your blue, your Chinese
Everybody we gotta get together... please!
The world of love
We have a world of love
All of you beautiful people hanging out together
Holding hands
Sing a song
Every woman and child and man
Wanna see peace in the holy land
Let the world of love
