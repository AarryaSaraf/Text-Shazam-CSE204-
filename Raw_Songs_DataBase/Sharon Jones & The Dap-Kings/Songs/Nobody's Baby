I done left you here
All you by yourself
But it ain't my fault, baby
You treated me like a fool
It ain't my fault, baby
That you treated me so cruel
But you know what?

I ain't nobody's baby
I ain't nobody's fool
I ain't nobody's baby
Get yourself a new one

I ain't nobody's baby
I ain't nobody's fool
I ain't nobody's baby
Get yourself a new one

It's a matter of fact
I expect I can't tell you that
I said, if what you need is a good little soldier
Well, I guess you better look again
Well you know, I ain't nobody's solider, oh lord no
I'm a bona fide cap-I-tan!
Cause I...

I ain't nobody's baby
I ain't nobody's fool
I ain't nobody's baby
Get yourself a new one
You better get yourself a new one

Get it, get it, get it, get it...
