How long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before a girl like me can move on
Oh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before I can say that you're gone

Every hour seams like a day
And every day is like a year
And every week is an eternity
Well I get lonely baby when you're not here

Oh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before a girl like me can move on
Oh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before I can say that you're gone

Won't you let me know, yeah
I'm in an awful state, baby
You said you loved me so
But I just don't know how long I can wait

How long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before I can say that you're gone

I asked your mama, I asked your papa
Your friends, your preacher and your boss
No one knows where you're gone to, baby
Or if you're coming back to me
Are we together or are we lost

Oh baby tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before a girl like me can move on
Oh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before I can say that you're gone

Will you let me know, yeah
I'm in an awful state, baby
You said you loved me so
But I just don't know how long I can wait

Oooh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before a girl like me can move on
Baby how long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before I can say that you're gone

Aaa how long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before a girl like me can move on
Baby how long do I have to wait for you, honey
Before I can say that you're gone

Yeah, how long, ooooh
Baby tell me how long
Do I have to wait, o tell me baby...
