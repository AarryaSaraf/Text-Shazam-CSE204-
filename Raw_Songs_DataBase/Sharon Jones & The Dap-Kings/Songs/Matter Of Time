Oh yeah

It's a matter of time
Before justice will come
It's a matter of time, yeah
Before all wars will be done
It's a matter of time
Before wrongs will be righted
It's a matter of time, yeah
Before all people will be united

Let's not wait any longer, yeah
Gonna struggle on so hard
All together we get stronger
It's a matter of time
It's a matter of time

Oh yeah

It's a matter of time
This is a song about peace
Just a little bit of time
Until freedom will mean free
I don't mean one side beating the other side
I mean no more sides
I'm talking about unity for all people
Woah, just a matter of time!
I can't wait too much longer
My frustration's near its end
I can't hate 'cause I am stronger
It's a matter of time
It's a matter of time

Oh yeah
C'mon, (hmm hmm)
Soon we'll have a peace of mind
In a matter of time
I can't wait too much longer
Will this world ever get better? (hmm hmm)
It's just a matter of time
