I was talkin' to a friend of mine
Said he don't want no wars no more
They're building bombs while our schools are falling
Tell me, what in the hell we're paying taxes for?

Well, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
Now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
Stopped paying taxes, y'all

Now, tell me who's gonna buy their bonds
Their tanks, their planes and all their guns?
Well, tell me who's gonna pay for their wars
If we all get together and cut their funds?

Yeah, listen people
Listen to what I've got to say

Now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
I said now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
We stopped paying taxes, y'all
Well, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
I said now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
We stopped paying taxes, y'all

There's something on my mind, yeah
And I think I've got to let it out, yeah

They can't take nothing from us
That we ain't ready to give
Well, how can we talk about the price of gas
When they're stealin' our brothers and sisters rights to live?

Well, now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
I said now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
We stopped paying taxes, y'all
Well, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
I said now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
We stopped paying taxes, y'all

That's right, ladies and gentlemen. Children of America, it's up to you. Let Mr Politician know how you feel. Let him know that you're not gonna take no more. Stop paying taxes. Stop paying for corruption and injustice. It's up to you

Now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
Hey, now, what if we all stopped paying taxes?
We stopped paying taxes, y'all
Yeah, what if we all, what if we all, what if we all
Stopped paying taxes?
Stopped paying taxes?
Alright
Yeah
Ooh, yeah
We stopped paying taxes, y'all
