Ain't no need to ask me, baby
'Bout what time I'm coming home
And ain't no need to ask me, baby
About when and where I roam

And ain't no need to wonder why
I like to come home late
You know I'll never do you wrong, baby
But you'll have to contemplate, well

I know you think you got your own thing
I know you think you got your own bag
But, believe me, baby, when I tell you
Your thing is a drag
Your thing is a drag

When we're at the party, baby
You're always asking when we're gonna go
Now didn't you hear me when I told you, baby
Ah, we were stayin' for the whole show

And when I'm singing at the club
Son, you never wanna come
Hey, and when you come, you're always askin' me, child
Baby, when we're gonna be done? Well

I know you think you got your own thing
I know you think you got your own bag
But, believe me, baby, when I tell you
Your thing is a drag
Your thing is a drag

You're always getting wound up
When you should be loose
When the rest of us are drinkin' and smokin'
Aw, you're sittin' at the bar and you're ordering juice

Well, you're always whinin' and whinin'
About the time that I don't make
Ooh, but when I try to make it good to you
It seems the time that you're head starts achin', well

I know you think you got your own thing
I know you think you got your own bag
But, believe me, baby, when I tell you
Your thing is a drag
Your thing is a drag

You know your thing is a drag
You know your thing is a drag, yeah
Ah, your thing is a drag, baby
You know your thing is a drag
