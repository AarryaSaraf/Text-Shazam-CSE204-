I'm a better woman than I have been
'Cause I don't think about way back when
It takes two to love but only one to leave
It was you who did that dirty deed

I got better things to do
Better things to do
Better things to do
Than remember you

I got better things to do
Better things to do
Better things to do
Than remember you

It's a brighter day than ever before
'Cause I don't think about you no more
I got a new life and I'm feeling right on
My head is high and my spirit is strong

I got better things to do
Better things to do
Better things to do
Than remember you

I got better things to do
Better things to do
Better things to do
Than remember you

I got better things to do

I got better things to do
Better things to do

Than remember you

I got better things to do
Better things to do
Better things to do
Than remember you

Better things to do
Than remember you
Better things to do
Than remember you

Better things to do
Than remember you
Better things to do
Than remember you

Better things to do
Than remember you
Better things to do
Than remember you

Better things to do
Than remember you
Better things to do
Than remember you

Better things to do
Than remember you
Better things to do
Than remember you

I'm a better woman than I have been
'Cause I don't think about way back when
It takes two to love but only one to leave
