I got a fish in my dish
And I'm feelin' fine
I got a fish in my dish
And I know it's mine

I remember when an old man said
Fish tastes better when it's fresh off the line
But I can tell you that it tastes even better
When I know that the line was mine (line was mine)

I got a fish in my dish
And I'm feelin' fine
I got a fish in my dish
And I know it's mine

You can take me down to Restaurant Row
Serve me salmon in a champagne wine
Ain't nothin better, baby, you can buy me
That tastes as good as when the line was mine (line was mine)

Yeah, talkin' 'bout some fresh broiled fish
Fish you catch yourself by your own two hands
Nothin' tastes better than that fish, aw
Till you've had some, you don't know what you're missin'

I got a fish in my dish
And I'm feelin' fine
I got a fish in my dish
And I know it's mine

Well, ain't nothin like your own
And eatin' the fish you just caught fresh that day
Nothing tastes better than your own fish yeah, haha
Tastes good, now just get the fork in it
Just cut it open and, mmm yeah

I got a fish in my dish
And I know it's mine, yeah
I got fish layin' right there in my dish
And it's mine, it's mine it's mine, yeah
