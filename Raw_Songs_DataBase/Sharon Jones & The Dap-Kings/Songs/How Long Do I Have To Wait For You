How long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before a girl like me can move on?
Ooh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before I can say that you're gone?

Every hour seems like a day
And every day is like a year
And every week is an eternity
Well, I get lonely, baby, when you're not here

Ooh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before a girl like me can move on?
Ooh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before I can say that you're gone?

Won't you let me know, yeah?
I'm in an awful state, baby
You said you loved me so
But I just don't know how long I can wait

How long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before I can say that you're gone?

I asked your mama, I asked your papa
Your friends, your preacher and your boss
No one knows where you're going to, baby
Or if you're coming back to me
Or if we're together or are we lost?

Ooh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before a girl like me can move on?
Ooh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before I can say that you're gone?

Won't you let me know, yeah?
I'm in an awful state, baby
You said you loved me so
But I just don't know how long I can wait

Oh baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before a girl like me can move on?
Baby, tell me how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before I can say that you're gone?

How, how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before a girl like me can move on?
Baby, how long do I have to wait for you, honey?
Before I can say that you're gone? Yeah
How long, yeah, baby tell me, how long
Do I have to wait for you, honey?
