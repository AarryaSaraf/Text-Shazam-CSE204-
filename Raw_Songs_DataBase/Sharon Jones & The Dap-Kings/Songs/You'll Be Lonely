You've been searchin' all of your life
For a good, good woman that'll treat you right
But now that I'm here, you can't understand
I'm the only one can love you, love you like no one can

You'll be lonely (you'll be lonely)
After I'm gone (after I'm gone)
You'll be lonely (you'll be lonely)
After I'm gone (after I'm gone)

Now didn't I tell you, in my lovin' arms
When you was down and out yeah, and lost all of your charm
You let me feed you, keep you warm at night
It's gonna come around baby, it's your turn to cry

You'll be lonely (you'll be lonely)
After I'm gone (after I'm gone)
You'll be lonely (you'll be lonely)
After I'm gone (after I'm gone)

You've been searchin' all of your life
For a good, good woman that'll treat you right
But now that I'm here, you can't understand
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
I'm the only one can love you, love you like no one can

You'll be lonely (you'll be lonely)
After I'm gone (after I'm gone)
You'll be lonely (you'll be lonely)
After I'm gone (after I'm gone)

You'll go hungry
After I'm gone
Cry my a river
After I'm gone

You'll be lonely (you'll be lonely)
After I'm gone (after I'm gone)
You'll be lonely (you'll be lonely)
After I'm gone (after I'm gone)
