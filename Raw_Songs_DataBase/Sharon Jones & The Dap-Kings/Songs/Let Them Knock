Let them knock upon my door
Until they hit them black and blue
I'm not answering for no one
Until my man and I are through

When we're makin' love
You know the world ain't got nothing, oh nothin' to do
Cause when we're makin' love
I don't answer to nobody but you

No, nobody but you babe
Not gonna answer to nobody, no, no

They can call me on the phone
But no matter how times that phone rings, baby
I'm not pickin' up for no one
Until the fat lady sings

When we're makin' love
Now you know the world ain't got nothing, oh! nothing on you
When we're making love
I won't answer to nobody but you

Oh, no

Listen now
People, they ask a lot of me
Alway want more than they got of me yeah
Let them say I'm hard to find
I know what I've got to do
And bring it all home to you
It's your love I got on my mind

Let them wait, let them wonder
Where I go and what I do - yeah yeah
I'm not answering to no one
Until you and I are through

When we're makin' love
You know the world ain't got nothin, oh ain't got nothin' to do
When we're makin' love
I won't answer to nobody but you

Nobody but but you

Nobody but you
I ain't gonna answer to nobody but you baby
Oh no matter how many time the phone rings or who's knockin' at the door
I'm not gonna answer, no, no, no, no, no
I ain't gonna answer no, no, no
Ain't gonna pick up the phone, don't even try
No, no, nobody, nobody, nobody
But you...
