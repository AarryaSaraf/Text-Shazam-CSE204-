He had a rainy day
I'm in a snake-backed situation
Here's a pencil pack
I'm gonna spread some information, oh, oh

You're makin' me happier
Now I am snappier
While I'm with you
I got to be havin' you
'Cause I am happier
When I met you

You're my little symphonia
(Singin' the weather)
I get a dogged blue ring (Ooh)
I get a slapped back echo
(Thought you were younger)
I get a purple string
('Cause it isn't in tune)
Beside the whistle cab
(Singin' the hours)
Along a frosty roadside
(Always in time)
I get another ring
(Makin' me happy)
That'll take me for another ride
(Up in the sky)
Whoa, Heaven is in her
She knows you're high

You're makin' me happier
Now I am snappier
While I'm with you
I got to be havin' you
'Cause I am happier
When I met you

Is that a dream storm?
(Dreamin' in and out of style)
I get an eight o'clock sit down
(Dreamin' for the other half so I can get on down)
Out in the country fields
(Runnin', smilin', laughin', jumpin', fun)
I feel the love the pretty sun
(Shinnin' on me)

Just havin' fun
Jump, laugh, and smile, and havin' fun
Laugh, smile and love, and get on down
Smile, love and burn, and get on down
Jump, laugh, and smile, and havin' fun
Laugh, smile and love, and get on down
Smile, love and burn, and get on down
Jump, laugh, and smile, and havin' fun
Laugh, smile and love, and get on down
