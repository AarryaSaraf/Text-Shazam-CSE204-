I know a man
He was born to be a poor
It made him so complain now
He decided to settle the score
He hit a bank
Said he'd like taking care of my child
He will leave him high on the hole
But he only left for a little while
Knock at his door
Who could it be
Noone but the Law
And then he put his gun yeah
And he shot the first men he saw
He killed them dead
You know the other men shot back
Now he's living in a wheelchair
Down at Blackpool down on the track

Ain't it hard
It got to be real hard
To get what he wanted

(Let me tell you a little something else)

(Now listen to the song)

I know a woman
And he hit her every day
You know she won't find no man
She won't find a shepherd just to get hurt
You see she ain't to be
She don't look too wrong now
But her children're hungry
They're hungry as the day is long
You see they put her man
They put him in an institution
Now she ain't got nothing no
She got nothing but a revolution
You see she lost her job
Now she got to try again yeah
You ain't no welfare it
They had to get back on her feet again yeah yeah

Ain't it hard
It got to be real hard
To get what she's lacking...
