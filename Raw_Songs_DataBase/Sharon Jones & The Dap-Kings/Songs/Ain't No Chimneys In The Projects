When I was a child I used to wonder
How Santa put my toys under the tree
I said, "Momma can you tell me how this can be?"
When there ain't no chimneys in the projects?
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)
Not in the ghetto
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)

Momma sat me down and said "Baby
Santa Clause does magic things
As soon as you're asleep a chimney will appear
And in the morning you will see all he brings
Don't you worry that their ain't no chimney's in the projects"
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)
Not in the ghetto
(Ain't no chimneys in the projects)
Not in the projects

Now I'm all grown and I see
It was the  that got that magic dime
But Momma now I know, that you were the one
There ain't no chimneys in the projects
Not in the ghetto
Ain't no chimneys in the projects

Momma was the one
It was Momma Momma Momma
