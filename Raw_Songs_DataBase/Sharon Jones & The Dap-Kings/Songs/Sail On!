Oh No

Well look who's here
Won't you come on in?
It's been a long long time
How you been?

Oh no
Tell me it ain't so
Someone threw you out
You got nowhere to go

Wait a minute
I don't suppose
You might recall
When I came knocking at your door
You said "sail on"
You told me to sail on
You told me to sail on
You told me to sail on

Wait a minute
If I do to you what you did to me
Tell me, tell me, where would we be?
Two people stranded without a helping hand
Two people stranded without a friend
Come on in
Come on in
Come on in
Come on in
Come on in
Come on in
Come on in
You and me, we're gonna sail on
