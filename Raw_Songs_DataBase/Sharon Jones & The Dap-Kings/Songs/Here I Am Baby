Here I am, baby
The one who swore to never yield
And here I am, baby
The one who swore to play the field

Said I wouldn't let no man tie me down
Not a single one now
Wasn't gonna ever give my heart
To a mother's son now
Many a day I proudly stated
The man for me ain't been created

But here I am, baby
The one who was so love defiant, oh
Here I am, baby
The one who was so self-reliant, oh

Said I wouldn't need a man or nothing else
I'd be independent
Make a fortune on my own
And I know how to spend it
I'd be so stationary
Love would be unnecessary
But here I am

Here I am, baby, baby
You want me and I do but I see
Here I am, baby
I find you're what I really need, oh

Say you got me hanging on a string
Go on, let me drop now
Since you started loving me
Don't you ever stop now
Don't wanna be loved by another
I ain't going another further

'Cause here I am, baby, baby
Take me 'cause I'm yours alone
Here I am, baby, baby, baby
Yours to call your very own, woah
Here I am, baby
Just take me, take me
I'm yours alone
Woah, here I am, baby, baby, baby
