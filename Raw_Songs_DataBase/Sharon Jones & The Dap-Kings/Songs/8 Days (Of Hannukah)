One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Days of love
Days of eight
Days of Hanukkah
Everyone of them glows with love

Eight Days of Hanukkah
Everyone of them glows with love

Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two

Day one
Time to light a candle
For those maccabees whose oil did burn and burn

Day two
Time to spin the dreidel
And hope that gimel shows up on my turn

Day 3
Fry a bunch of Latkes with applesauce, sour cream, and all

Day 4
We're cooking up the brisket
The kosher butcher sold my uncle saul

Day five
I like it more than PESACH
Let's leave the manischewitz on the shelf

Day six
Gifts for the children
Five dollar checks from great grandma Sel

Day 7
Light a whole bunch of candles
Gotta keep that SHAMAS going right to left
All the way until

Day 8
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Days of love
Days of eight... days of hanukkah

Every one of them glows with love
Eight days of hHanukkah
Every one of them glows with love

Ooooooooo

Eight days dreidel dreidel dreidel
Eight days I made it out of clay
Eight days and when it's dry and ready... yahh
Eight days ooh... dreidel I will play
Eight days talking about that menorah
Eight days... yay... yay... yay... yay... yay... hey
Eight days
