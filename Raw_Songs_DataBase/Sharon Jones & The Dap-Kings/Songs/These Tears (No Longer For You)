(These tears are no longer for you, baby)
(These tears are no longer for you, baby)

No more tears shall I weep
Or cry myself to sleep, oh
So long; I'm moving on
These tears are mine to keep
(But don't cry)

Oh, it's so hard (When I think about you, baby)
Whoa, I fall apart (When I'm without you, baby)
Then I know I must (Carry on)

(I won't cry)

(These tears are no longer for you, baby)
These tears
Are no longer for you baby

I cried away the pain for so long
I sat there and played the fool
Farewell to what was wrong
No more do they belong to you
(But don't cry)

Oh, it's so hard (When I think about you, baby)
I fall apart (When I'm without you, baby)
But I know I must (Carry on)

(I won't cry)

(These tears are no longer for you, baby)
These tears
Are no longer for you baby
