Givin up is hard to do
When you really love someone
Givin up is hard to do
When you still depend upon

His warm and tender touch
His kiss and his caress
That used to mean so much
And bring you happiness

(Givin up) Oh, Lord, is hard to do
I try, but it's just no use
(Givin up) Oh, Lord, is hard to do
I tried, but I kept recluse

The light of hope burns dim
But in my heart I pray
My love and faith in him
Will bring him back someday

(Givin up)
But it's just no use
(Givin up)
No, I can't break loose

Whether he knows or not
He really needs me too
Lord, he's all I've got
And giving up

Is so hard to do (Givin up) (Givin up)
Is so hard to do (Givin up) (Givin up)
I just can't break loose (Givin up) (Givin up)
I just can't break loose (Givin up) (Givin up)
Is so hard to do (Givin up) (Givin up)
Is so hard to do (Givin up) (Givin up)
I just can't break loose (Givin up) (Givin up)
