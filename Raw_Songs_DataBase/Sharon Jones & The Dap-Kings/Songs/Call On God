You know your life gets filled with so much sorrow
And it seems like there's no tomorrow
In these times that we live here today
Seems like everything is in your way

You just call, call on God
And He'll be your friend
Just call, call on God
And He'll carry you through
Just call, call on God
And He will provide
Yes, He will (Yes, He will)
Provide
For you

I made up my mind to be with Him all the time
And I won't let nothing turn me around
To be like Him is what I long to be
And to share His love to eternity

You just call, call on God
And He'll be your friend
Just call, call on God
And He'll carry you through
Call, call on God
And He will provide
Yes, He will (Yes, He will)
Provide
For you
