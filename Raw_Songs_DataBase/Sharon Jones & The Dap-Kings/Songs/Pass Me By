Baby there's something that is on my mind
But I really don't want to say it
Baby, I know all the games you're playing
But I'm getting so tired of playing them

The cost of my love for you is getting too high
I'ma save myself and say

I think you better pass me by
You can go your own way
Do what you got to do
You can go your own way, baby
'Cause that's what I'm gonna do, too

Baby, I thought that it would last and last
Sometimes the ending just comes too fast
Sad when the end it comes too late
Shame to see a good love turn hateful

The cost of my love for you is getting too high
I'ma save myself and say

I think you better pass me by
You can go your own way
Do what you got to do
You can go your own way, baby
'Cause that's what I'm gonna do, too

(Pass me by)
I think you better pass me by
(You can go your own way)
You can go your own way
(Pass me by)
(You can go your own way)
Do what you go to do, oh
(Pass me by)
(You can go your own way)
Gonna do, I got to do
(Pass me by)
