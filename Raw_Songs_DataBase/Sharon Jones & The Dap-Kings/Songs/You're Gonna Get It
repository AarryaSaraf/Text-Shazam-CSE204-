Some love makes you helpless
Some love makes you strong
And some love makes you do right
And some love make you do wrong

Believe me when I tell you
I got the kind of love
That's gonna make you higher, baby
Than what you're dreaming of

And I'm gonna give it to you, oh baby (my love)
And I'm gonna give it to you, oh baby (my love)
I'm gonna give it to you, oh baby (my love)
You're gonna get it

Now I'm no professor, baby
But I know a few things
You see, a rooster needs a sunrise
Before he rises up and sings

A fish without no water
Is a fish that cannot swim
And if you want a man to be his best friend
You gotta give him, give your love to him

And I'm gonna give it to you, oh baby (my love)
I'm gonna give it to you, oh darling (my love)
I'm gonna give it to you, oh baby (my love)
You're gonna get it

Oh
Some love make you helpless
Some love makes you strong
And some love makes you do right
Some love makes you do wrong

If you want to know what love can do
Open up your arms, you won't regret it
I got a mighty kind of love and, boy
You're gonna get it

I'm gonna give it to you, oh baby (my love)
I'm gonna give it to you, oh darling (my love)
I'm gonna give it to you, oh baby (my love)
You're gonna get it

I'm gonna give it
I'm gonna give it to you, yeah, my love
You're gonna get it
