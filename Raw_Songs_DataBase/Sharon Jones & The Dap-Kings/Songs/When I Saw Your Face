Looking at your picture, baby
Brings back sweet memories
Of all the good times we had together, baby
Just you and me

I didn't believe in love at first sight
Kept telling myself, "This can't be right"

(When I saw your face, I knew that I was in love)
When I saw your face
I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew
(When I saw your face)
I was in love
(I knew that I was in love)

The gleam in your eyes
Sent little tingles down my spine
But then you smiled and looked at me
And I was frozen in time

Didn't believe in love at first sight
Kept telling myself, "This can't be right"

When I saw your face
(When I saw your face)
I knew
(I knew that I was in love)
When I saw your face
(When I saw your face)
I knew
(I knew that I was in love)
I was in love
Ooh oh
Love!

Ooh
When I saw your face
(When I saw your face)
I knew
(I knew that I was in love)
I was in love
And when I
(When I saw your face)
I knew
(I knew that I was in love)
Knew I was in love
