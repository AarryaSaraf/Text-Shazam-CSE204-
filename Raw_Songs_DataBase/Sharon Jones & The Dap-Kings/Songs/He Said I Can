There ain't nobody
Can take away the pain
I said nobody
There ain't nobody
Can take away the pain
I said nobody
Can take away the pain
After where I've been
I'll never love again
Then I found me a man
Mmm he took me by the hand
He look up to my heart
And yes he said I can
Yes he said

He said I can
He said I can
He said I can
He said I can

He said he could love me
Like nobody will
Said he takes me out of the valley
Up to the top of the hill
He said he never mind...
And make my love a little lighter
And never... noo
If he could take it even higher

He said I can
He said I can
He said I can
He said I can

Never found me a man
He took me by my hand
He look into my heart
And he said I can
Yes he did

He said I can
He said I can
He said I can
He said I can
