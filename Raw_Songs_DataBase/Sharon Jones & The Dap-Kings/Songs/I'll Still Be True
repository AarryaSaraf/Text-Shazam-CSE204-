You call me your woman
Then you go and do me wrong
Expecting me to carry on
Like it's good

We always hurt each other
Even though we're miles apart
You leave me with a wounded heart
Over you

Loving you
It's so easy to do
You can say that we're through
I'll still be true

You took me for granted
One too many times
Now these teary eyes
Can't go on

I made my decision
And I tried to walk away
But Lord, you know
I wanna stay by your side

Baby, loving you
Always so easy to do
'Cause you can say that we're through
I'll still be true

You took me for granted
One too many times
Now these teary eyes
Can't go on

I made my decision
And I tried to walk away
But Lord, you know
I wanna stay by your side

Baby, loving you
It's so easy to do
You can say that we're through
I'm gonna be still loving only, only you

Loving only you
Deep down in my heart
Loving only you
Oh yes, I am, only you

I'm trying to believe that you've changed, yeah
I'm trying, trying to believe that you've changed

Deep down in my heart I want to believe
Trying to believe that you've changed
