Oooo
Oooo

I don't need your promises
I don't need your lies
I don't need your tears
I don't need your sighs

Just call me your baby and I'll love you over again
Just give me your time

I'm outside your door
I don't mind the rain
I'm just waiting and waiting and waiting
For an end to this pain
Just let me in baby and I'll love you over again
Just give your time

Oooo
Oooo

Don't worry baby
I won't break your heart
I can be gentle
Like I was at the start
I'll love you over and over and over again
Just give me some time
Give me some time - oh yeah
Just give me some time
Just a little time
