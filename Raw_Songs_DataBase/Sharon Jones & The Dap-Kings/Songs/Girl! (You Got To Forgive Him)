(Girl! Are you crazy?)
Are you gonna let true love slip through your hands?
Are you gonna let the (the little things)
Get in the way of a good loving man?
You've got to (open up your mind)
You must (forgive and forget, girl)
You got to (listen to the man)
His heart is filled with regret

I know he did you dirty
But I'm begging you (Listen to this song)
It's a shame to lose a love so strong

Girl, you got to forgive him
Girl, you got to forgive him
Before it's too late

(Girl! Are you crazy?)
Are you gonna let true love slip through your hands?
Are you gonna let all (the little things)
Get in the way of a good loving man?
It was so long ago (Another time)
You were so far away (Another place)
It was a one-time thing (One time)
Don't let his love slip away

I know he did you dirty
But I'm begging you (Listen to this song)
It's a shame to lose a love so strong

Girl, you got to forgive him
Girl, you got to forgive him
