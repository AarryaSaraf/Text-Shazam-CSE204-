Seems like you've been wasting time
Trying to find your place in life
You need to get your ducks all in a row
Stop acting so peculiar
Get on boy, I won't fool ya
Follow me; I'll show you what you don't know

So take some time to understand
That life's a race for each and every man
Sometimes people will treat you like a worn out shoe
But they don't know that you can't lose

Now if you seem to get off track
I'll be there to get you back
Don't you worry, I'll be in your corner
When the chips are stacked against you
Just remember that I'm with ya
Keep on moving right past the finish line

So take some time, understand
That life is a race for each and every man
Sometimes people will treat you like a worn out shoe
But they don't know that you can't lose

Come and be a winner
Come and be a winner
Come and be a winner
Come and be a winner
Be a winner, just a winner
Be a winner, just a winner
Now you're winner
You're a winner, yes you are!
Beause you got me, yeah!
