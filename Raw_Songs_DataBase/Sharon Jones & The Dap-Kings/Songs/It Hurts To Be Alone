After he
Breaks your heart
Then you'll be sad
And your teardrops start
Then you'll know how
It hurts to be alone
Mm, hmm, hmm, mm

Just because
You think you're so smart
Going around
Breaking lovers' hearts
Now you're defeated by your own weapon
Mm, mm-hmm, hmm, mm-mm-mm

Mm, mm-mm, mm
After she
Breaks your heart
Then you'll be sad
And your teardrops start
Then you'll know how
It hurts to be alone
Mm, hmm, mm, mm-mm, mm
