You gotta be Genuine
If you're gonna be mine mine mine
You gotta be Genuine
If you're gonna be mine mine mine
Now, there's one thing that will seal the deal
Man got to love me with a love that squeals
And I don't care much about design
But the man sure got to be Genuine
And there's one thing I'm sure not taking
To be fool with a man that comes home faking
Don't walk away if I ain't told you
Now that will be the day that I will not hold you

Because you gotta be Genuine
If you're gonna be mine mine mine

Now if he's love don't come on strong
I'm gonna turn around
I'm gonna turn around
Yes, I'm gonna turn around
And say so long, bye bye
I'm gone

No money, no clothes, no fancy car
Gonna make that man a superstar
If he ain't a man down to his bones
He's gonna wake up one day and I'll be gone

He's gotta be Genuine
If you're gonna be mine mine mine

Now if he's love don't come on strong
I'm gonna turn around
I'm gonna turn around
Yes, I'm gonna turn around
And say so long, bye bye
Baby I'm gone
Bye bye, I'll be gone

Now, there's one thing that will seal the deal
Man got to love me with a love that squeals
And I don't care much about design
But the man sure got to be Genuine
Now if he's love don't come on strong
I'm gonna turn around
I'm gonna turn around
Yes, I'm gonna turn around
And say so long, bye bye
Baby I'm gone
Bye bye
You gotta be Genuine
You gotta be Genuine
You gotta be Genuine
