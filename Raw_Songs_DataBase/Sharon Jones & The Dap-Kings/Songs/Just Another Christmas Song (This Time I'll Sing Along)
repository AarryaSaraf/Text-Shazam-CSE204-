Uh... Just another Christmas song, but this time I'll sing along
Uh... Just another Christmas song, but this time I'll sing along

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas with jingle bells in the sky
Silent night and little drummer boy

It's the same (ooohhh) old song, but I'll sing a long...
Uh... huh... I'm gonna sing along

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Happy herald angel sing
The red nose reindeer is riding high...

Let it snow... ooooh... let it snow
Oohh...

Just another Christmas song, but this time I'll sing along
Mmmmhhmm... yah
Just another Christmas song, but this time I'll sing along

Do you see what I see... ooohh...
Mmmm
Christmas tree...

It's the same (ahhh) old song, but I'll sing along...
Just another Christmas song but this time I'll sing along
I'm gonna sing a long...
Just another Christmas song but this time I'll sing along
Just another little song...
Just another Christmas song but this time I'll sing along

I said I think I'll sing along

Just another Christmas song but this time I'll sing along
Ooohh...

This time I'll sing along
This time I'll sing along
This time I'll sing along
This time I'll sing along
This time I'll sing along
This time I'll sing along
This time I'll sing along
This time I'll sing along

Merry Christmas everybody
