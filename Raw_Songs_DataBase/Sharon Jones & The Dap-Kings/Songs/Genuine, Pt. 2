Genuine
If you gonna be mine, mine, mine
You got to be genuine
If you gonna be mine, mine, mine
Now there's one thing that will seal the deal
A man's gotta love me with a love that's real
I don't care much about design
But the man sure got to be genuine
Don't walk away if I ain't told you
For that will be the day that I will not hold you
If you ain't a man down to your bones
You'll wake up one day and I'll be gone
You got to be genuine
Now if he's love don't come on strong
I'm gonna turn around, I'm gonna turn around
Yes, I'm gonna turn around
And say so long, bye bye
I'm gone

You got to be genuine, You got to be genuine, You got to be genuine, You got to be genuine, You got to be genuine, You got to be genuine...
