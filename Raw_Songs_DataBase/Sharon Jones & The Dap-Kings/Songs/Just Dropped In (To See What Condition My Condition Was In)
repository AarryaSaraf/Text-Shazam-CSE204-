Woke up this mornin' with the sundown shinin' in
Found my mind in a brown paper bag within
Tripped on a cloud, fell eight miles high
Tore my mind on a jagged sky
Hey, I dropped in to see what condition, my condition was in
Pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and then I followed it in
Watched myself crawlin' out as I was crawlin' in
I got up so tight I couldn't unwind
Saw so much 'til I broke my mind
Hey, I dropped in to see what condition, my condition was in
Yeah-yeah-yeah
See what condition I was in
Hey, yeah, baby, see what condition I was in

I got up so tight I couldn't unwind
Saw so much 'til I broke my mind
I just dropped in to see what condition, my condition was in
Someone painted, "April fool" in big black letters on a dead-end sign
I had my foot on the gas since I left the road and I blew out my mind
Eight miles outta Memphis and I got no spare
Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere
I dropped in, check out this condition my condition was in
Hey, check out the condition, oh, my condition was in
Yeah-yeah, oh, what condition my condition was in
Ooh, I'm checking it out
I got to see what condition it's in
Hey, I got to check out my condition and see-
What order, just make sure it's all right now, oh-yeah
