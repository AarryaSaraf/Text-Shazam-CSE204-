The other day when I was sugar
Just to talk to you
How I was swayin' and all aquiver
At the thought of you
But now it seems just like my dreams
I've got quite a lot of you
And I believe...
I'm settling in

Oh yeah, settling in

There was a time when I would hesitate
To steal a kiss
But now I smile as I contemplate
Your ready lips
It's been a while
Since you put an end to my restlessness
And I believe I'm settling in

I know my friend never believed someone would reel me in
But in the end, you were the one who sealed me in
And now my loneliness is what I'll never, ever feel again
Yes I believe I'm settling in

I believe I'm setting in, yes I am
