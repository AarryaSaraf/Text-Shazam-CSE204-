This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, well, to the New York island
From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters
I tell ya: This land was made for you and me

As I went walking down that ribbon of highway
I saw above me, oh, that endless skyway
Now I saw below me that golden valley
And I said: This land was made for you and me

As I was walking, now, they tried to stop me
They put up a sign that said, oh, it said: Private Property
Well, on the back side, you know it said nothing
So, it must be that side was made for you and me

One bright sunny morning, well, in the shadow of a steeple
Down by the Welfare office, I saw my people
You know, now, they stood hungry, I stood wondering
I was wondering if this land was made for you and me

This land is your land, this land is my land
From Riverside, California, oh, to Staten Island
Well, oh, down to Modesto, Georgia, oh, don't forget to say Philadelphia, oh
We moving down to Mississippi, oh, Houston, Texas, ah LA
Yeah, you know, ah, this land is your land, this land is my land
This land is your land
You've got to believe, this my land
Ooh, this land was made for you and me...
