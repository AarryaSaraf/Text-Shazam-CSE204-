Come they told me
Pa rum pum pum pum (Pa rum pum pum pum)

A new born king to see
Pa rum... pum pum pum (Pa rum... pum pum pum)

Our finest gifts we bring
Pa rum... pum pum pum (Pa rum... pum pum pum)

To lay before the king
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum

So to honor him
Pa rum pum pum pum
When he comes

Li... ttle baby
Pa rum pum pum pum (Pa rum pum pum pum)

He is a poor boy too
Pa rum pum... pum pum (Pa rum pum... pum pum)

He has no gift to bring
Pa rum pum pum pum (Pa rum pum pum pum)

That's fit to give our king
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Shall he play for him
Pa rum pum pum pum
On his drum

Mary nodded
Pa rum pum pum pum (Pa rum pum pum pum)

The ox and lamb kept time
Pa rum pum pum pum (Pa rum pum pum pum)

He played his drum for him
Pa rum pum pum pum (Pa rum pum pum pum)

He played his best for him
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Then he smiled at him
Pa rum pum pum pum
He and his dru... ummm
