Yeah, money
Without money what would we do?
We got a little idea
We see what's gone

We say, "Money is the root of all evil"
But there ain't nothing evil about money

Because we need that money
To pay the bills
To pay the rent

Banks folding
President scratching his head
The economy is bad

Wall Street about to lose their mind
Going up and down
Gas prices, up and down
Nobody knows what to do

You know what we need though

Money, where have you gone to?
Money, where have you gone to?

I gotta pay my bills
Gotta pay my rent
I'm hungry and I'm tired
But my money's all spent

Money, where have you gone to?
Money, where are you hiding?
I said, "Money, where are you hiding?"

I work like a dog, year after year
Like a ghost when I need you
You always disappear

Money, where are you hiding?
Money, why won't you stay a while?
I said, "Money, why won't you stay a while?"

You see we scrimp we save
Like to keep you around
When you needed, you're nowhere to be found
Money, why won't you stay a while?

Honey, get that money, yo
You go out and sell everything you own

Hell no
I'm a scrimp
I'ma keep on scrimpin' to the top
Ain't gonna stand on no corners
Shoo them

Money, why don't you like me?
Money, why don't you like me?

Was it something that I said?
Was it something that I done?
I always let you play me
But you never liked me, none

Money, why don't you like me?

Everybody needs money, what you gonna do?
Without that money never gonna get through
Everybody needs money, what you gonna do?
Without that money never gonna get through

Everybody needs money, what you gonna do?
Without that money never gonna get through
Everybody needs money, what you gonna do?
Without that money never gonna get through

Everybody needs money, what you gonna do?
Without that money never gonna get through
Everybody needs money, what you gonna do?
Without that money never gonna get through
