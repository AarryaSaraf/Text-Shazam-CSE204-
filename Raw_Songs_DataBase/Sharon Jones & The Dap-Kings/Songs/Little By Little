Little by little by little by little by little
Little by little by little by little by little

You're messing up my life
Tearing me apart
Breaking up my world
And I'm giving up my heart, ooh
Little by little by little by little

I'm losing all my pride
It's really getting bad
Hurting deep inside
It's a-making me go mad, ooh
Little by little by little

Little by little
Bit by bit, by bit
I'm going crazy and you're causing it
Little by little
Bit by bit
I should stop caring
But my love won't quit

Little by little by little by little by little
Little by little by little
Little by little by little by little by little
Oh, yeah yeah yeah

I don't know where to turn
Don't know what to do
I'm walking on thin ice
And it seems I'm falling through, ooh
Little by little by little

Little by little
Bit by bit
I'm going crazy and I'm causing it
Little by little
Bit by bit
Should stop caring
But my love won't quit

I'm the queen of fools
Know the deck is stacked
On a losing streak
But I'm gonna get you back, whoa

Little by little by little
Little by little by little by little by little
Whoa, little by little, yeah
Little by little by little by little by little
Little by little by little by little
Little by little by little by little by little
Little by little by little by little
Little by little by little by little by little
Little by little by little by little by little
Little by little by little by little by little
Little by little by little by little by little
