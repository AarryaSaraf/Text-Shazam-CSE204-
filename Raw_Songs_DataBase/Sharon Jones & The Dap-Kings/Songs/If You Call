I been layin'
Alone for hours
But I haven't slept at all
These eyes are closed
But I'm listening

For your call
For your call

These feet, too tired for walking
And these knees too weak to crawl
But these arms are strong enough to hold you

If you call
If you call

Am I dead
Or am I living
I feel no blood in these veins
But I could live, live and die like this forever
If I know I'll taste your lips again

Doctor, doctor
Come cut my heart out
Cause it hardly ohh beats at all
But please, please leave a little potion
Just in case my baby calls
Just in case ohh my baby calls

If you call
If you call
If you call
