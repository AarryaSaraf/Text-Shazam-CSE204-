I got a thing on my mind
Sure'nuff gonna find it
I got a thing on my mind
Sure'nuff gonna find it

Don't let nobody tell me
My thing it won't come true
Cause I ain't lying down 'til I get my dues

I got I thing on my mind
Sure'nuff gonna find it
I got I thing on my mind
I'm sure'nuff gonna find it

Now good things don't come easy
The lord knows that I'm trying
Cause I got what I got
Cause better folks have died

I got I thing on my mind
Sure'nuff gonna find it
I got a thing on my mind
Sure'nuff gonna find it

I got I thing on my mind
Sure'nuff gonna find it
I got I thing on my mind
I'm sure'nuff gonna find it

Some folks talking
About a war on crime
I'm talking about a city y'all
Where brothers don't have to steal to make a dime

I got I thing on my mind
Sure'nuff gonna find it
I got I thing on my mind
I'm sure'nuff gonna find it

I got a thing on my mind
Sure'nuff gonna find it
I got a thing on my mind
I'm sure'nuff gonna find it

I got a thing on my mind
Sure'nuff gonna find it
I got a thing on my mind
I'm sure'nuff gonna find it
