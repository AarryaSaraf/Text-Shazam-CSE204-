You think after all this time, I wouldn't be surprised
You think there'd be nothing new when I looked into your eyes
You think there ain't nothing about you that I ain't realized

But every time I see you
But every time I see you, darlin'
But every time I see you
I fall in love all over again

How many times I thought I knew you better than no one could
How many times I thought I'd love you more than any heart would
How many times I thought these things but I misunderstood

'Cause every time I see you
'Cause every time I see you, darlin'
But every time I see you
I fall in love all over again

And the years may come passing by, yeah
We're gonna get old, wrinkled and gray
But I can't think of nothing better
No better way to pass the time
Then falling in love day after day after day

After all the love we made you'd think that we'd be tired
And after every part of you I've kissed and I've admired
After all that we've been through, we ought to be uninspired

But every time I see you
But every time I see you, darlin'
Every time I see you
I fall in love all over again

Fallin' in love again
I'm fallin' in love again
I'm, I'm fallin' in love again, oh yeah
Well, it feels like I'm fallin' in love all over again
Feels like I'm fallin' in love all over again
Fallin' in love all over again
