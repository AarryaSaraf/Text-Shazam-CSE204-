When I was a child I believed what they told me (every word)
"To each one shall come what each one shall earn"
And if I worked hard nobody could hold me (hold me)
And cheaters will fail, that's what they all learned
(Cheaters never prosper)
There is a man who is born with a fortune
A hard day's work he's never done (livin' on easy street)
He lives from the sweat of other men's labor
As he sips his champagne and lays in the sun

Money don't follow sweat
Money don't follow brains
Money don't follow deeds of reason

People don't get what they deserve (no they don't)
People don't get what they deserve

There is a man who lives like a saint (so innocent)
He works from daybreak to late in the night (work, work)
He's never stolen, he's never been lazy (not a day in his life)
To feed his children is always a fight (work work work)
I try to do right by all of God's children (all of God's children)
I work very hard for all I could afford
But I don't pretend for one single moment (no)
That what I get is my just reward (life ain't fair no)

Money don't follow sweat
Money don't follow brains
Money don't follow deeds of reason

(People don't get what they deserve)
