Simple sounds are in my ear, coming from a radio
Oh no - where did all the good times go?
In the daytime all I am is a working fool
And in the nighttime I'm trying to keep my cool
I know that people say (Gotta be a better way)
But there ain't no golden goose that'll get you paid

Through the hard times
Can't sit on the sideline
(You know we gotta get ahead)
I'm gonna keep on trying

I've been searching for a new day
Some peace of mind is gonna come my way
(And if you don't find it?)
I'll keep on searching for it
(I hope you find it)
I know I'll find it

If I find what I'm looking for, I could rule the world
A brand new superstar, once an ordinary girl
And with my newfound fame, I could lend a helping hand
To all those in need, however I can
Since you know just what I'm looking for
Maybe you can be the one that can open up the door

Can you hear me knocking?
And everyone is thumping
(We're just trying to get ahead)
I'm gonna keep on trying

I've been searching for a new day
Some peace of mind is gonna come my way
(And if you don't find it?)
I'll keep on searching for it
(I know you'll find it)
I know I'll find it

I've been searching for a new day
Some peace of mind is gonna come my way
(And if you don't find it?)
I'll keep on searching for it
(I know you'll find it)
I know I'll find it
