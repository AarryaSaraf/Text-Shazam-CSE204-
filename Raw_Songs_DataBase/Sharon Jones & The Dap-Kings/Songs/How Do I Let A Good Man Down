See we've been getting on
So good so far for so long
No, you never hurt me
No, you never gone and done me wrong

I know that something just ain't no good
But you always do exactly what you should
So tell me?

How do I let a good man down?
How do I let a good man down?

You gotta believe me
I didn't mean to find nobody else
I don't wanna hurt you
But I gotta do right by myself

You make me happy, but he gives me thrills
You give me comfort, but he gives me chills
So tell me?

How do I let a good man down?
How do I let a good man down?

I know that it's crazy
To walk away from such a good thing
But I'm gonna gamble
And I bet that this ain't just a fling

I can't have my cake and eat it too
So I gotta get up and walk out on you
Please tell me?

How do I let a good man down?
How do I let a good man down?

How, how do I let him down
I said, I, I gotta let him down
I said, I, I gotta let him down
How do I
How do I let a good man down?
How do I
How do I let a good man down?
I gotta let him down
I gotta let him down
I gotta let him down
I gotta let him down
