It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling... hear them ring

City sidewalk. (u-huh)
Busy sidewalk (u-huh)
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of christmas... (in the city it's christmas time)
Children laughing... (u-huh)

Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear (in the city it's Christmas time)

Silver bells, (Silver bells) Silver bells, (silver bells)

Strings of streetlights (u-huh)
Even stop lights (u-huh)
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures (in the city it's christmas time)
Hear the snow crunch (u-huh)
See the kids rush (u-huh)
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you'll hear (in the city it's christmas time)

Silver bells, (Silver bells) Silver bells, (silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city (in the city, in the city)
