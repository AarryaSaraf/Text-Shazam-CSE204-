Baby, baby, baby
I'm tired of tryin' to change your mind, oh
But if you can't see what you're doin' to me
Then baby you must be blind, oh
But I'm not gonna cry
Lord, no
I'm not gonna cry, no no
Said I'm not gonna cry, mmmm hey

Sounds so nice
Play it twice

Hey, In your heart I know your mind's made up
But in your head you're still uncertain, uh yeah ya see
We got a lot of love worth waitin' for
And baby I don't mind waiting
Oh, let me tell you
No, I'm not gonna cry
Oh, not gonna cry, no no no
I say I'm not gonna cry
I'm not gonna cry

Baby, baby, baby, babe
I'm tired of tryin' to change your mind
Well now if you can't see what you're doin' to me
Oh honey you must be blind
Imma tell you again
I'm not gonna cry, no no no
I'm not gonna cry
I'm not gonna cry, oh
Tears not gonna fall from my eyes, mmm yeah
