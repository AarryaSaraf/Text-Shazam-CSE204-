Don't want to know
Where you been all tonight
Ain't no words you can tell me, baby
To make me feel alright

But if you hold me
In your arms
We can forget all our worries
And all our harms

If you make it good to me baby
The way it used to be

(Can it ever be thesame?)
I don't know, I don't know
But it is tonight
(Won't your friends say it's a shame)
Let em talk, I don't care if it's right
You see the hour's getting late
So take some direction
You see it's half past making up time
And a quarter to affection

But if you ain't got no new thing to say
You better go on and fix it the old fashioned way
And make it good to me baby
The way it used to be

Don't want to hear
Bout your intentions, yeah
You see I heard them all before, darlin
Too many times to mention, yea

If those two lips are gona assist me
You better come on boy
Come over here and kiss me yea
And make it

Good to me baby
The way it used to be

Can you ignore the pain and sorrow?
A woman's heart begins to get a little numb sometimes yes it does
Will you regret it tomorrow?
Tomorrow may not ever come
So you know you better make it good to me, baby
The way it used to be

Said come on baby
I said come on darlin
Tomorrow may not ever come
No, no, yea

So you better make it
Good to me baby
Oh yea
You better make it
Good to me baby
Oh yea

I said come on baby
Come on darlin
I said make it good
Make it good to me baby

Come on make it good
