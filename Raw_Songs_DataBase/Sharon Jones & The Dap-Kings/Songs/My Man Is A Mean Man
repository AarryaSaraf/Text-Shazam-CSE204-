He lifts me up to the sky
To watch me fall to the ground
He calls me when he needs me
He leaves me when I'm down

He plays with my love
Just like I ain't got no heart
Then he reels me in easy
He says we never gonna part

My man is a mean man
My man is a mean man
He's such a mean, mean man
My man is a mean man

How can I do right
When he don't follow no reason?
I can't tell when he's balling
I can't tell when he's teasing

I try all that I can
To keep from making him mad
What kind of a love
Makes a girl feel so bad

My man is a mean man
My man is a mean man
He's such a mean, mean man
My man is a mean man

My man is a mean man
My man is a mean man
He's such a mean, mean man
My man is a mean man

When I tell him I'm leaving
I know he's gonna be mad
Ain't got no words he can give now
Than what I've already had

It ain't gonna be easy
To be all alone
My heart is gonna be heavy
But they gonna be my own

And after all
Then I walk out the door
He's still gonna be a mean man
But he won't be my man no more

My man is a mean man
My man is a mean man
He's such a mean, mean man
My man is a mean man

Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Hey

My man is a mean man
My man is a mean man
My man is a mean man
