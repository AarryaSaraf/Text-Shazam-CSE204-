Rumors
I heard a rumor about you
And they tell me that you're no good
Are you my one and only
Can you show me
You got to show me
Don't tell me that you're uptight

Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
I want to know
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
Mhmmm
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
I got to know baby
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby

Promise
Are you a man of your word
Or are you playing
Players get what they want
That's what they told me
But what they told me don't matter
When you hold me

Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
I wanna know
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
Mhmmm yeah
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
I want to know
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
Uh, I wanna feel it inside
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
I wanna know
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
Mhmm yeah, I gotta feel it inside
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
I wanna know
Rumors tell me that you're no good, baby
