Little kid in a small town
I did my best just to fit in
Broke my heart on the playground, mmh
When they said I was different

Oh, now
Now, I'm all grown up and nothin' has changed
Yeah, it's still the same

It's a hard life on easy street
Just white painted picket fences far as you can see
If you think we live in the land of the free
You should try to be black like me

My daddy worked day and night
For an old house and a used car
Just to live that good life, mmh
It shouldn't be twice as hard

Oh, now
Now, I'm all grown up and nothin' has changed
Yeah, it's still the same

It's a hard life on easy street
Just white painted picket fences far as you can see
If you think we live in the land of the free
You should try to be, oh, black like me

Oh, I know
I'm not
The only one
Oh, yeah
Who feels
Like I
I don't belong

It's a hard life on easy street
Just white painted picket fences far as you can see
And if you think we live in the land of the free
You should try to be, oh, black like me
Oh, and some day we'll all be free
And I'm proud to be, oh, black like me
And I'm proud to be black like me
I'm proud to be black like me
Black like me
