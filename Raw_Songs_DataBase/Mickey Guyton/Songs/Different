I love my skin, I love my hair
And if it bothers you, I really don't care
I love my hips, I love my thighs
The way they move and they shake when the beat's just right

And my momma always said
Everybody's got their own kinda rhythm
And you better celebrate what you is
Never mind what's you isn't

'Cause that's what makes you different
One in a billion
Go ahead and just own it
It kinda feels good, don't it?
'Cause that's what makes you different

Don't wanna fit in, I wanna fit out
Don't want no cookie cutter watering me down
I'm just me, take it or leave
I'm just trying to be who I was born to be

Yeah my momma always said
Everybody's gonna have their opinion
And just be true to who you are
If you do, then there ain't no competition

'Cause that's what makes you different
One in a billion
Go ahead and just own it
It kinda feels good, don't it?
'Cause that's what makes you different

Don't need permission
Oh, go ahead and just flaunt it
Oh, when you got it, you got it
And that's what makes you different

You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it, you got it
When you got it, you got it
You got it, you got it, you got it
When you got it, you got it
You got it, you got it, you got it
When you got it, you got it
You got it, you got it, you got it

Can't help it
Can't help it
Can't help it
I just can't help it, help it
Can't help it
Can't help it
Can't help it
I just can't help it, help it

Yeah, my momma always said
Everybody's got their own kinda rhythm
That's what makes you different
One in a billion
Go ahead and just own it
It kinda feels good, don't it?

'Cause that's what makes you different
Don't need permission
Oh, go ahead and just flaunt it
When you got it, you got it
That's what makes you different

Can't help it
Can't help it
Can't help it
I just can't help it, help it

That's what makes you different

Can't help it
Can't help it
Can't help it
I just can't help it, help it

When you got it, you got it
You got it, you got it, you got it
When you got it, you got it
You got it, you got it, you got it

When you got it, you got it
You got it, you got it, you got it
When you got it, you got it
You got it, you got it, you got it
