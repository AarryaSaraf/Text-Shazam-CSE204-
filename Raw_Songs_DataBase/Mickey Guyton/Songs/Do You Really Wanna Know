Really
I've been living in survival mode
Really
I'm just doing my best to be intentional

And don't say, "Hello, how you doing?"
If you don't really care to know
'Cause really
I'll just say I'm good to keep you comfortable

But if I tell you the truth
Will your heart be big enough to hold it?
Let my guard down and let you in
Will you believe it or see it as weakness?

'Cause I got a lot on my mind
Tonight
So don't ask me why
If you don't really wanna know

Really
I've been going twice a week to therapy
Really
Tryna change the way I think about the way I think

I hit rock bottom
Hit the bottle so much harder
It was dark for a minute
(But I'm better for it)

If I tell you the truth
Will your heart be big enough to hold it?
Let my guard down and let you in
Will you believe it or see it as weakness?

'Cause I got a lot on my mind
Tonight
So don't ask me why
If you don't really wanna know

Do you really wanna know?

I'm so used to telling little lies
I'm so used to telling little lies

But if I tell you the truth
Will your heart be big enough to hold it?
Let my guard down and let you in
Will you believe it or see it as weakness?

'Cause I got a lot on my mind
Tonight
So don't ask me why
If you don't really wanna know

Do you really wanna know?
