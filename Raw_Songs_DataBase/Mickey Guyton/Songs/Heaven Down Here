Hey God, it's me
I hate to be a bother
But I could use a minute or two
Yeah, I'm just so
Heartbroken, disappointed
In the way this world is coming unglued

And I can't help but wonder are you

If you got a little love
Left in your back pocket
Rain it down like pennies
In this wishing well of tears
I know that you're busy
But if you could hear me talking
We could use a little more heaven down here
We could use a little more heaven down here

We could use
We could use
We could use a little more heaven
We could use
We could use
We could use a little more heaven

Hey God, I know
I don't hit you up that often
But the world is turning upside down
I swear it feels
Like all we've got is problems
And there's so many, I'm losing count

If you got a little love
Left in your back pocket
Rain it down like pennies in this
Wishing well of tears
I know that you're busy
But If you could hear me talking
We could use a little more heaven down here
We could use a little more heaven down here

We could use
We could use
We could use a little more heaven
We could use
We could use
We could use a little more heaven

Hey God, it's me
We're really going though it
And I can't help but wonder are you

If you got a little love
Left in your back pocket
Rain it down like pennies
In this wishing well of tears
I know that you're busy but
If you could hear me talking
We could use a little more heaven down here
We could use a little more heaven down here

We could use
We could use
We could use a little more heaven
We could use
We could use
We could use a little more heaven
We could use
We could use
We could use a little more heaven
We could use
We could use
We could use a little more heaven
