You want to touch it, don't you?
Try to run your fingers through
Like the weight of your hand
Could ever make you understand
What it feels like to be
A different just like me
You know the weight of your hand
Could never make you understand

The things I'd do to try to fit right in
I'm tired of trying to justify my skin

I used to think
What God gave me wasn't fair
I'd braid it all
Just to hide the curls up there
I found my freedom
When I learned not to care
Now I'm not scared
To love who I am
I love my hair

If I could go back to twelve
I would tell myself
That straight up or down
Baby, that's your crown
Whoever made up those rules
They don't apply to you
A straight up or down
I turn the world around

I used to think
What God gave me wasn't fair
I'd braid it all
Just to hide the curls up there
I found my freedom
When I learned not to care
Now I'm not scared
To love who I am
I love my hair

(I love my, I love my, I love my hair)
(I love my, I love my, I love my hair)

The things I did to try to fit right in
I'll never justify my skin again

I used to think
What God gave me wasn't fair
I'd braid it all
Just to hide the curls up there
But I found my freedom
When I learned not to care
Now I'm not scared
To love who I am
I love my hair
