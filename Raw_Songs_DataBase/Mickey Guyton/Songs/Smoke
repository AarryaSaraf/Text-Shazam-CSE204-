You say I'm suspicious
All up in your business
Like to call me crazy
When I get to throwing dishes

You say what's my confirmation
Making eggs and bacon
You see me with the skillet
Better quit testing my patience

Baby, go ahead admit it
I just might forgive it
Pushing my buttons, about to push me to my limit
I know, a girl always knows

Where there's smoke
Where there's smoke

There's a hot coal match striking
Spark plug switch igniting
Kerosene kinda fire

I'm not over protective
That's just your perspective
I'm just looking out
For the return on my investment

Baby, why are you sweating?
I just got some questions
Are you trying to keep straight
All the lies that you been telling?

Baby, go ahead admit it
I just might forgive it
Pushing my buttons, about to push me to my limit
I know, yeah, a woman always knows

Where there's smoke
Where there's smoke
There's a grandma chicken grease
Firetruck in the street
Preacher preach kinda fire

Yeah, I know
A woman always knows

Where there's smoke
Where there's smoke
Where there's smoke
Where there's smoke

There's a fuse lit
Fahrenheit, powder keg, dynamite
Burning man kinda fire
