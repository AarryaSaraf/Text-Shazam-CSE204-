I feel it in the air
I can see through your smoke and mirrors
Baby, let your heart be naked
I'm right here

Come meet me on other side
And make it rain in this burning house
Pouring down till the Sun comes up
I'm right here

I want your good, your bad, your ugly
I want the truth and all your lies
I want your perfectly imperfect
Lay it on me tonight

I want the light that fills the darkness
Give me your heaven and your hell
I wanna show you that you're worth it
Lay it on me tonight

Slow dancin' on a tight rope
I let your walls crash down
No, I ain't tryin' to be your savior
But I'm right here
Oh, I'm right here

I want your good, your bad, your ugly
I want the truth and all your lies
I want your perfectly imperfect
Lay it on me tonight

I want the light that fills the darkness
Give me your heaven and your hell
I wanna show you that you're worth it
Lay it on me tonight

Ooh-ooh-ooh, whoa-whoa
Ooh-ooh-ooh, lay it on me
Ooh-ooh-ooh, whoa-whoa
Lay it on me tonight

(Lay it on me, lay it on me)
(Lay it on me, lay it on me)

I want your good, your bad, your ugly
I want the truth and all your lies
I want your perfectly imperfect
Lay it on me tonight

Ooh-ooh-ooh, whoa-whoa
Ooh-ooh-ooh, lay it on me
Ooh-ooh-ooh, whoa-whoa
Lay it on me tonight

I want the light that fills the darkness
Give me your heaven and your hell
I wanna show you that you're worth it
Lay it on me tonight
Lay it on me tonight
