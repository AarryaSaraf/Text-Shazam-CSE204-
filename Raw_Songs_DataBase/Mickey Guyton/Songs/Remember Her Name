Birds on a wire all fly away
Nobody wanna stand in a hurricane
When everyone else walks away
She'll still remain

Where did you lose the girl with no fear
Oh she never left
Take a good look she's right in the mirror
Don't let yourself forget

Remember the fire
Remember her face
She felt the storm and danced out in the pouring rain
Remember her laughing
Through all the pain
Remember the girl that didn't let anything get in her way
Remember her name
Remember her name

Don't let go of that wide eyed innocence
Let that wild child run on the wind
Keep that shine, that lights up the room
Hold onto it

Remember the fire
Remember her face
She felt the storm and danced out in the pouring rain
Remember her laughing
Through all the pain
Remember the girl that didn't let anything get in her way
Remember her name
Remember her name

Where did you lose the girl with no fear
Oh she never left
Take a good look she's right in the mirror
Don't let yourself forget

Remember the fire
Remember her face
She felt the storm and danced out in the pouring rain
Remember her laughing
Through all the pain
Remember the girl that didn't let anything get in her way
Remember her name
Remember her name
Remember her name
Remember her name
