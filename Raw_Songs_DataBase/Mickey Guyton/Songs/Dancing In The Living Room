We can turn the world off
Forget about what's goin' on outside
We can make it all stop
Freeze a little time tonight

Don't need a DJ, a disco ball
No cover charge, no last call
Just pull me close
And let's see where this goes

Turn the lights down low
Let's take it slow
Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room

It's just you and me in our bare feet
Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room

We can put a record on
Spin me like the vinyl, 'round and 'round
Pour the drinks and make 'em strong
Burn up every candle in this house

Turn the lights down low
Let's take it slow
Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room

It's just you and me in our bare feet
Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room

Don't need a DJ, a disco ball
If I got you, I got it all
Just pull me close
And let's see where this goes

The lights down low
Let's take it slow
Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room

It's just you and me in our bare feet
Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room

Dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room
Slow dancing in the living room
