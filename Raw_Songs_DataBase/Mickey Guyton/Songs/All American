We're the lines on the interstate
The dust on a back road
We're a Friday night football game
The lighters at a rock show
We're the night shift, smoke break, high school heartache
Driving with the windows down
We're the dance floors, church pews, suit and ties, tattoos
One big small town

Ain't we all, ain't we all All American
Ain't we all, ain't we all All American

We're the stars in a Texas sky
And the jukebox vinyl
We're the New York city lights
And a hotel bible
We're hand me down, tailor made, daisy dukes, dookie braids
James Brown and James Dean
We're cold beer, champagne, millionaires, spare some change
And everything in between

Ain't we all, ain't we all All American
Ain't we all, ain't we all All American
We got the same stars, the same stripes
Just wanna live that good life
Ain't we all, ain't we all All American

We're different in a million ways
But at the end of the day
Ain't we all (Ain't we all), All American

Ain't we all (Ain't we all), ain't we all All American (All American)
Ain't we all (Ain't we all), ain't we all All American (All American)
We got the same stars, the same stripes (The same stripes)
Just wanna live that good life
Ain't we all, ain't we all All American

Ain't we all, All American
