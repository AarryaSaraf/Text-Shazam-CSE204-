Wasn't born to do anything half way
Wasn't born to try just a little
'Cuz that's just the way
Just the way that I'm made
I'm not made to live in the middle, the middle
So many people play it safe and
Spend their lives chained to limitations
But not me

I'm gonna fly without a net
Live my life limitless
Take my shot and risk it all
'Cuz the climb is worth the fall
Fly
Fly

Wasn't born to give anything but my best
Wasn't born to ever surrender
I would rather give my life this one life I get
Live it like the greatest adventure, adventure
Too many people take the safe road
But I'm not made to go where they go
That's not me

I'm gonna fly without a net
Live my life limitless
Take my shot and risk it all
'Cuz the climb is worth the fall

With no pain, there's no glory
I'm gonna write my own story
Starting now
Pushing hard every minute
Pushing past every limit
Won't look back, won't back down

I'm gonna fly without a net
Live my life limitless
Take my shot and risk it all
'Cuz the climb is worth the fall
Fly
Fly
Fly
Fly
