Hey boy
What you say boy
You tryna play coy
Like a game boy
Hit my phone boy
Is you home boy
Are you alone boy
Come give me dome boy
Got a boy with degrees
A boy in the streets
A boy on his knees
He a man in the sheets
Sheesh, it's all Greek to me
Got this boy speaking Spanish, ai papi

Baby I don't need you
I just wanna freak you
I heard you a freak too
What's two plus two
(Four, three, two, ow!)

Boy
Boy
Boy
(Make a girl go crazy)
(Four, three, two, ow!)
Boy
Boy
Boy
(Make a girl go crazy)
(Four, three)

I like big boys, itty bitty boys
Mississippi boys, inner city boys
I like the pretty boys with the bow tie
Get your nails did, let it blow dry
I like a big beard, I like a clean face
I don't discriminate, come and get a taste
From the playboys to the gayboys
Go and slay boys, you my fave boys

Baby I don't need you
(Oh I don't need)
I just wanna freak you
(Oh I want it now)
I heard you a freak too
(That's right)
What's two plus two
(Four, three, two, ow!)

Boy

(Make a girl go crazy)
(Four, three, two, ow!)
