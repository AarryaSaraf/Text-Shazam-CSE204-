I talked to my girl friends yesterday
They reminded me of when you had me crying in my car
And when you came to my barbecue
They all gave you attitude, well shoot
Every reason they mad at you is true

But we promised to make up
Even if it's gonna take us
All of our lives
I'm willing to give it another try
We need to do this like
Love's on the line
This time

Boy, you know you better
Ooh, you know you better
Boy, you know you better
Watch out
'Cause boy, you know me better
You know me so much better
You know that I don't break up twice

And my love so good, it hurts
You make it work 'cause you know my worth
And I can have any man I want
But I never had nobody with a love like you
It will be a shame not to see this through
Who gonna put up with your gemini shit like I do

And we promised to make up
Even if it's gonna take us
All of our lives
I'm willing to give it another try
We need to do this like
Love's on the line
Real love, it takes time

Boy, you know you better
Ooh, you know you better
Boy, you know you better
Watch out
'Cause boy, you know me better
You know me so much better

You know that I don't break up, you know that I don't break up twice (Takes time)
Ooh, ooh (Takes time)
Oh, oh (Takes time)
Boy, you know you better (Takes time, takes time)
You know that I don't break up twice
