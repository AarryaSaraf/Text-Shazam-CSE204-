So here we are
You are finally able to listen to this album I've working on it for three years and I know it's been a long time and it's about damn time I put it out. But you have to know that I took my time for me but I also took my time for you. I wrote almost 170 songs for this album to find this perfect twelve songs to bring to you because I felt like this was not only I needed to hear but you needed to hear and the whole world needs to hear. These are songs about love, whether self-love, love your family, love your friends, or love for significant other. I really believe that love for one self and for others is what this world needs to be a better place. If you can take just the time to give a little love to yourself every single day, treat yourself with respect, treat yourself the way you deserve to be treated and then treat somebody else the same love or respect that expands, that grows and that can save a life. It saved my life so many times and I'm so honored to be a part of your life, I hope you enjoy the music, I hope you cry, laugh, dance, twerk, do the split, do whatever you wanna do. I'm honored to be doing it with you so thank you for listening to Special, loving Special and being special cause if you don't take nothing away from this album I want you to know you're special and I'm so glad you're still with us. Thank you
