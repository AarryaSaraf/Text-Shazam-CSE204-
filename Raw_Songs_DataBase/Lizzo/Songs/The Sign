Hi, motherfucker, did you miss me?
I've been home since 2020
I've been twerking and making smoothies
It's called healing

And I feel better since you've seen me last
I've been training, I can flex that ass
So when I shake it, I can shake it fast
Make that camera flash, camera flash, camera flash

If you're looking for the sign, bitch, I'm it (Hoo-hoo, ooh)
And I know you seen me coming 'cause I'm thick (Hoo-hoo, ooh)
I got that oh, hell no, you can't get this at the store
Whoa, now you know
If you're looking for the sign, bitch, I'm it (Hoo-hoo, ooh)
And I know you wanna fuck with me again (Hoo-hoo, ooh)
I got that oh, hell no, you can't get this at the store
Whoa

Huh, just a second, let me fix my wig, yeah
Dealing with him put me through some shit, yeah
But I can't forget I'm still that bitch, yeah
I live inside his head and pay no rent, yeah
It's lit, yeah

Uh, big rich, big sad (Na, na-na-na-na)
I'm cute when I'm mad (Na-na-na-na)
Bitch, I fell off but I'm back, you're back (Na-na-na-na)
I'm worth my weight (Na, na-na-na-na)
I'm two hours late (Na-na-na-na)
But I'm on my way, hoe (Na-na-na-na, aye)

If you're looking for the sign, bitch, I'm it (Hoo-hoo, ooh)
And I know you seen me coming 'cause I'm thick (Hoo-hoo, ooh)
I got that oh, hell no, you can't get this at the store
Whoa, now you know
If you're looking for the sign, bitch, I'm it (Hoo-hoo, ooh)
And I know you wanna fuck with me again (Hoo-hoo, ooh)
I got that oh, hell no, you can't get this at the store
Whoa, now you know

(Na, na-na-na-na) I keep on writing these songs
(Na, na-na-na-na) 'Cause he keep on doing me wrong
(Na, na-na-na-na) And my girls keep singing along like
Oh-woo, hoo, oh-woo, hoo (Hey, hey, hey)

Don't need that energy, bitch, I'm a Tesla
Hey, hey, fuck up me on the dresser
Don't need that energy, bitch, I'm a Tesla (Oh-woo, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Hey, hey, fuck up me on the dresser

If you're looking for the sign, bitch, I'm it (Hey, hey, hey, hoo-hoo, ooh)
And I know you seen me coming 'cause I'm thick (Hey, hey, hoo-hoo, ooh)
I got that oh, hell no, you can't get this at the store (Damn, girl, hell no)
Whoa, now you know (Hey, hey, hey)
If you're looking for the sign, bitch, I'm it (Hey, hey, hey, hoo-hoo, ooh)
And I know you wanna fuck with me again (You wanna fuck with me, hoo-hoo, ooh)
I got that oh, hell no, you can't get this at the store (Uh-uh)
Whoa, now you know (Hey, hey, hey)

I keep on writing these songs
'Cause he keep on doing me wrong
And my girls keep singing along, uh
I guess that I'm not alone
