Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah (Ah)
Stayin' alive (Oh yeah, woo)

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I been kicked around since I was born

And now it's alright, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
It was stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive
Ow, what you want

Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of Heaven on my shoes
I'm dancin' and I just can't lose

And now it's alright, it's okay
I'll live to see another day
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive (Stayin' alive, stayin' alive)
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
It was stayin' alive, stayin' alive (Stayin' alive)
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah (Oh)
Stayin' alive (Woo, hoo hoo)
Ow, what you want

I'm stayin' alive
Life goin' nowhere, somebody, help me (Somebody, help me)
Somebody, help me, yeah (I'm stayin' alive, I'm stayin' alive)
Life goin' nowhere (Nowhere)
Somebody, help me, yeah (Nowhere)
I'm stayin' alive (Stayin' alive)
Life goin' nowhere, somebody, help me (Somebody, help me)
Somebody, help me, yeah (Help me, yeah)
(Life goin' nowhere)
Life goin' nowhere (Stayin' alive, stayin' alive, stayin' alive)
Somebody, help me, yeah (Stayin' alive, stayin' alive, stayin' alive)
I'm stayin' alive (Stayin' alive, stayin' alive)
(I'm stayin' alive, just stayin' alive)
Life goin' nowhere, somebody, help me (I'm stayin' alive)
Somebody, help me, yeah (You stayin' alive, we stayin' alive)
Life goin' nowhere (Ow)
Somebody, help me, yeah (I'm stayin' alive)
I'm stayin' alive (I'm stayin' alive)
Life goin' nowhere, somebody, help me
Somebody, help me, yeah (Life goin' nowhere)
Life goin' nowhere (Come on, y'all)
Somebody, help me, yeah (Yeah)
