// That's How Rumors Get Started //

It's been a while since I've been on this side of town
Don't cross the river much these days
Haven't been avoidin' you, I'm hardly ever around
Sure, we could talk, but what would I say?

And here you are
Still doin' you
Never worked out
But it never stopped you
All I know is every time
That your lips are parted
Right behind my back
That's how rumors get started
That's how rumors get started

Word travels faster than a whisper in the wind
Now all the birds are flyin' south
Black hawks and doves, we are at it once again
And you're talkin' out of both sides of your mouth

And here you are
Still doin' you
It never worked out
But it never stopped you
All I know is every time
That your lips are parted
Right behind my back
That's how rumors get started
That's how rumors get started

You're burnin' bridges, keepin' warm by the fire
For what a lovely glow it makes
I'm growin' tired of being your exit fire
Bet it's hard to sleep in a bed of lies that you made

And here you are
Still doin' you
It never worked out
But it never stopped you
All I know is every time
That your lips are parted
Right behind my back
That's how rumors get started
That's how rumors get started

That's how rumors get started
That's how rumors get started

// Letting Me Down //

School was done and you were gone so fast
Gave up everything that couldn't last
Borrowed money that you never paid back
And left a hole in this town
They don't make em like you no more
Your mama's working at the liquor store
But we don't talk about it anymore
And you don't come around

Everybody's lonely
Awe babe, just look around

You got away
You got a way
Of letting me down

You were in another dream I had
Still running from your dead beat dad
I had a feeling it would turn out bad
And I never woke up
Bad luck you know it don't come cheap
But shit changes baby, nothing's concrete
A full moon above an empty street
I only wanted your love

Everybody's lonely
Awe babe, just look around

Everybody's lonely
Awe babe, just look around

You got away
You got away
You got a way
Way way
Of letting me down
You keep letting me down
Letting me down
Down down down...

// Twinkle Twinkle //

Way back in the good old days
Things weren't really all that good
We grew up with the TV on
We learned how from Hollywood
We learned how from Hollywood

Riding with my headphones on
In the back of my mama's car
Winding down that dirty road
Town was close but it felt far
Town was close but it felt far

Drive-in movies, Coca-Cola
Sweet 16, that kiss of death
Don't you cry when you should laugh
I smell liquor on your breath
I smell liquor on your breath

If it don't break you
It might just make you rich
You might not get there
And on the way it's a bitch

Riding with my headphones on
In the back of my mama's car
Winding down that dirty road
Town was close but it felt far
Town was close but it felt far

Gettin by, gettin high
Feeling like a low life bum
Racked up debt, couldn't pay my rent
Pissin off til kingdom come
Pissin off til kingdom come

Mother Mary, geez Louise
I was havin a ball until I threw it too far
Playin dives, tryin to stay alive
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

If it don't break you
It might just make you rich
You might not get there
And on the way it's a bitch
It's a bitch

But then I won the lottery
I stuck gold and they picked me
Winner winner, chicken dinner
Hello mama look at me
Hello mama look at me

Now everything's turned inside out
They wanna put me on a big TV
Everybody wants to know
How I feel and what I think
How I feel and what I think

If it don't break you
It might just make you rich
You might not get there
And on the way it's a bitch
Don't you know it's a bitch?
It's a bitch

// Stone Me //

Everybody wants to live in a glass house
I'm rather stay home cause when I go out
I wish I never did
Take me back home, when I was a kid

Sobriety is a hell of a drug
They say you only fight with the people you love
But I won't forget what it's like to be poor
I could be there again, baby that's for sure

Love me, hate me
Desecrate me
Call me a bitch
Then call me baby
You don't know me
You don't own me
Yeah that's no way
To stone me
Yeah that's no way
To stone me

You can pick a side but both are wrong
You can fight the good fight but you're on your own
I used to feel loved but now I feel used
I almost went broke just from paying dues

Through the mud and rain you can drag my name
You can say I've spent my life in vain
But I won't be ashamed of what I am
For your judgement day I don't give a damn

Love me, hate me
Desecrate me
Call me a bitch
Then call me baby
You don't know me
You don't own me
Yeah that's no way
To stone me
Yeah that's no way
To stone me
Yeah that's no way
To stone me
Yeah that's no way
To stone me

// Hey Child //

Hey, child, you've got blood
On your doorstep
Long eyes, cheap talk
Strange voices
How long can you hold
Hold down your resistance?
Hey, child, you don't know
No, baby, you don't know your own existence

And in the ruins of the nights that we went
Writin' numbers on our arms
But when you wake up to find there's nothin' left
Don't you know your future's almost gone?

Hey, child, you better get right on you
Hey, child, you got so many better things to do

Hey, child, you've got dogs
Dogs that guard your weakness
Pull in all your wounded men
Oh, baby, don't you know that they're useless?

Your lamp is burnin' low, and the streets are cold and wet
You're just a face without a name
But when you wake up and find there's nothin' left
Oh, honey, baby, ain't it a shame?

Hey, child, you better get it right on you
Hey, child, you got so many better things to do

Hey, child, no, you ain't found it yet
Hey, child, you better quit placin' all those bets
Hey, child, no, no, no, no, no
Hey, child, you're gonna get it right on you
Hey, child (Woah)

// Heartless Mind //

Should I stay? I believe
If I was wise I would leave
Love's a house that might be haunted
Don't tell me this was what you wanted

Build me up just to tear me down
Sometimes I wonder why I'm still around
You needed shelter, that's what I gave
And summer comfort became a cage

I got a restless feeling that I'm wasting my time
You got a mindless heart, you got a heartless mind
Before you use me, try to treat me kind
You got a heartless mind, you got a heartless mind (Yeah)

Memories runnin' like a jet
Am I that easy to forget?
How could this ever turn out well?
Blind man playing William Tell

I got a restless feeling that I'm wasting my time
You got a mindless heart, you got a heartless mind
Before you use me, try to treat me kind
You got a heartless mind, you got a heartless mind (Yeah)
You got a heartless mind, you got a heartless mind (Yeah)
Oh, oh

// What Happened To Our Love? //

He asked you questions only I could answer
You were the music and I was the dancer
You were the medicine and I was the cancer
What happened to our love?

Can't get through, it's not like before
You were the footsteps and I was the floor
Silence grew like a cold, cold war
What happened to our love?

What is this life, and what does it mean?
Time, it runs out and rips at the seams
Like oil in water, hellfire and rain
We fight, we make up, just to make love again

You were the lightning and I was the thunder
Came on like a tidal wave and pulled me under
That kind of chemistry can make anyone wonder
What happened to our love?

You were the flower and I was the rain
You were the needle and I was the vein
You were the blood and I was the stain
When the push came to shove

If anyone here knew me the best
You put me to bed when I needed rest
Came in from the East, burned out in the West
Like a fire from above

Born in the pain, die in the mud
We wander this Earth as we circle the Sun
In time and through space, 'til we're dust in the wind
But I love you so much that I'd find you again, find you again

What is this life, and what does it mean?
Time, it runs out and rips at the seams
Like oil in water, hellfire and rain
We screw, we break up, just to make love again

// Gone To Stay //

Baby, when I'm gone
You know I think about you
You're growing up so fast
And I'm gettin' older too
And I've made mistakes
Yeah, I'm living proof of that
All the wasted days
Can't ever get 'em back

Check my bags, board again
It's a lonely flight from where I've been

Can't turn money back to time
Take it from me, darling of mine
And I've been doubting it these days
The river, it runs
Only one way
And when it's gone (When it's gone)
It's gone to stay

Baby, when I'm gone
You're learnin' how to live
Remember not to take so much
So you have something left to give
Just think of me in the love that I leave behind
Let it grow around you
Like a tie that binds

Half disconnected on the phone
I face the crowd, but I sleep alone

Can't turn money back to time
Take it from me, darling of mine
And I've been doubting it these days
The river, it runs
Only one way
When it's gone (When it's gone)
It's gone to stay

// Prisoner Of The Highway //

I grew where I was planted
But I never felt at home
My head was filled with questions
And my feet, they long to roam
My arms reached out like branches
But my heart just couldn't stay
I left the moment that I could, a prisoner of the highway

I passed by farms and trailers
As I drove through little towns
I found trouble in the city
I never set my suitcase down
And in those empty alleys
Where retaining walls decay
I just kept a-moving as a prisoner of the highway

Ooh, and I don't know where I'm headed
Ooh, and I don't know where it ends

Well, the wind, it felt like freedom
As it whipped through my hair
I was everywhere and everyone
I was nobody and nowhere
Oh, the map was written on my hand and in my DNA
I believe that I was meant to be a prisoner of the highway

Had chains around my ankles
Handcuffs on my wrists
I was haunted by decisions
And simple things I missed
Dear God, why do I wander?
Was I born this way?
And I prayed he would release me as a prisoner of the highway

Ooh, and I don't know where I'm headed
Ooh, and I don't know where it ends

I sacrificed my family
Sacrificed true love
I sacrificed my unborn child to the heavens up above
Oh, there was not a limit
To those I would betray
Oh, I was deep down in it as a prisoner of the highway
I just kept a-moving as a prisoner of the highway (Highway, ooh)

// I'd Die For You //

Some folks do and others preach
Some bring sand back to the beach
Some learn hate and others teach
Some don't understand
Some say everything's okay
Some say what all the others say
Some folks give, some take away
Just because they can

All I want, make no mistake
Oh, I don't have a side to take
And I can't live for them, it's true
But honey, I would die for you
I'd die for you

Boards go up, signs come down
Put a new face on this town
Make it smile, make it frown
Just as long as the money's good
Pennies in a woman's hand
Missing teeth, old payment plans
Kids want something worth a damn
Oh, they're just pissing in a flood

But all I want, let's make it clear
Oh, I'm not tryna make a lie sincere
To myself, I may be untrue
But honey, I would die for you
I'd die for you

Some go low, some get high
Some get drunk on wasted time
Some say yours, some say mine
But we all bleed the same blood
Naked streets of Babylon
Silver ships out in the dawn
Rob the graves we landed on
Or they'll be washed out in the mud

But all I want, make no mistake
Oh, I don't have a side to take
And I can't live for them, it's true
But honey, I would die for you
Oh baby, I would die for you
I would die for you
I'd die for you

// Goin' To The Country //

Livin' in the land of the dead hay
Blind in the burned out street
Garbage everywhere, everybody's fightin'
For a bigger piece of me

Whole thing's lame, it's killin' my brain
Guess it's just who I am
I'll keep goin' on the old dirt road
You can keep the traffic jam

Goin' to the country
Goin' to the country
Gonna lick off milk and honey
And work a piece of land
Blend it in the springtime
Can it for the cold time
Way up on the high-line
Gettin' back to where I been

Hey

Well, I been in the crowd just tryna get out
For a very long time indeed
Lookin' for a home where I can grow
My pretty little wildwood weed

Gonna get me a farm with a horse and a barn
And plant fifteen acres a week
I been livin' off the grid and smokin' on some licks
Come harvest, have a big ol' feast

Yeah, goin' to the country
Goin' to the country
Gonna lick off milk and honey
And work a piece of land
Blend it in the springtime
Can it for the cold time
Way up on the high line
Gettin' back to where I been

Get out in the country
Gettin' back to where I been

// Long Live The King //

Elvis sang Willie Nelson
On the day that he died
"Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain"
With the pain inside
He took his pills and he went to bed
Heart attack's what the paper said
But what I'd give just one more time to hear him sing

But the King is dead (Ooh-ooh)
He's long gone (Ooh-ooh)
Long live the King (Ooh)

MLK was a Christian
He loved Ghandi, he loved girls
Grew up in segregation
But he saw another world
He marched and sang and stood for the poor
He was for the fight, but against the war
But they murdered him like Christ 'cause he had a dream

But the King is dead (The King is dead)
He's long gone (Long gone)
Long live the King

They gunned down John Lennon
On a cold winter night (Ooh-ohh)
Outside of the Dakota
In the middle of his prime
They put him down for speaking the truth
He was a feminist and an asshole too
But in the end, he risked it all for love and peace, yeah

King is dead (The King is dead)
He's long gone (Long gone)
Long live the King
Long live the King

// You Don't Own Me //

You don't own me
I'm not just one of your many toys
You don't own me
Don't say I can't play with other boys

Don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
And when I go out with you, baby
Don't put me on display cuz

You don't own me
Don't try to change me in any way
You don't own me
Don't tie me down cuz I'd never stay

I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself, baby
That's all I ask of you
I'm young and I love to be young
Baby I'm free and I need to be free
To live my life the that way I want
To say and do whatever I please cuz

You don't own me
Please keep my body out of your hands
You don't own me
I won't make any other demands

Don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
And please when I go out with you, baby
Don't put me on display
And I'm young and I love to be you
Baby I'm free and I need to be free
To live my life the way that I want
To say and do whatever I please cuz

You don't own me

// Hitman //

This worn-out world, it makes no sense
Going insane out of self-defense
Sell all my shit
Move to the sticks
Be a hitman for hire

Maybe I'll change my name to Ghost
Captain a boat on the northeast coast
Live off of fish
Try to stay afloat
Set the past on fire

Spend my days out burnin' the wind
Wake up hazed, try to do it again
But you can't go back
Where you've never been
Hitman

Sell everything that I ever bought
Rob a bank, hope I don't get caught
Scratch of the VIN
On a car that's hot
Drive it down the line

Desert horse, I'm out 'til dawn
Over the dunes to the setting sun
Making moves
Like Chaka Khan
Running out of time

In this dream you play a part
How can you be who you are?
You're not akin
To who you've been

I want to be reborn again
Rattlesnake that sheds its skin
But you can't go back
To where you've never been
Hitman

// He Made A Woman Out Of Me (Billy Reid Fame Session) //

I was born on a levee
Little bit south of Montgomery
Mama worked in the big house
Daddy, he worked for the county

Never had no learning
Until I turned sixteen
When Joe Henry come up the river
Lord, made a woman outta me (yes, he did)
Lord, he made a woman outta me (yeah)

I used to tease Joe Henry
I guess it served me right
It wasn't long till he left me
Crying out in the night

Joe Henry had his say
He went and set me free
I need to tell everybody
That the man made a woman outta me (yes, he did)
Lord, he made a woman outta me (yeah)

When I think back to that day so long ago
I get a little feeling on my mind
Although it hurt me, there's one thing I know
When he left, he left a woman behind

When I meet another young man
Wanting to love and run (yeah)
Mind goes back to Joe Henry James
And the heck of a job he'd done (uh-huh)

Ain't no other man let me down
You see, I've been set free
Ever since way back yonder
When Joey made a woman outta me (yes, he did)
Lord, he made a woman outta me (made a woman)
Lord, he made a woman outta me (yeah)
Joey made a woman outta me (yes, he did)
Lord, he made a woman outta me
Made a woman outta me (yes he did)
Mmh

// Later On //

Floods are raging down in Houston
Fires burn in Californ'
Say it's pains of evolution
Maybe the end is being born

But your eyes babe, they're blue and peaceful
But there's something on your mind
Maybe the world is dark and evil
Blind lead the blind

Love and only love could save you
You'll find that out where you go
You'll need it later on
Down the road

See the man with a gun in his hand
Puts his finger on the trigger and pays the cost
Well, what's the reason? Why'd he do it?
If you try to find the answer you'll get lost

Love and only love could save you
You'll find that out where you go
You'll need it later on
Down the road

Now we're living this delusion
When they call it civil lies
I'm just a product of all these products
And the prize that we idolize

Love and only love could save you
You'll find that out where you go
You'll need it later on
Down the road

Need it later on
Down the road

// You're No Good //

Feelin' better now that we're through
Feelin' better cause I'm over you
I learned my lesson, it left a scar
Now I can see how you really are

You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good

I broke a heart that's gentle and true
Well, I broke a heart over someone like you
I'll beg his forgiveness on bended knee
How would I blame him if he said to me

You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good

I'm turnin' you down, baby, and I'm goin' my way
Forget about you, baby, 'cause I'm leavin' to stay

You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good
No, no, no
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good

You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
No, no, you're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good (You're no good)
You're no good, baby (You're no good)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Baby, you're no good

// Better Than Nothin' //

Well, I'm leaving in the morning by the pink and the blue
Rubbing my eyes 'til a picture comes through
Of the great evacuation on all of the screens
But it's better than nothing, at least

Well, the scholars are rambling and the searchers are lost
They hung all their sins on the wrong kind of cross
The highway's abandoned, the brick man's deceased
But it's better than nothing, at least

I'm revving my engine, I laid my own tracks
But the farther you drive, well, it's hard to get back
You can't be cured without sickness, blessed by the priest
But it's better than nothing, at least

Well, I'm out on the fringes, but I guess it's my fault
The wheels of my sanity have come to a halt
Is it better to go crazy, forsake the masterpiece?
Well, it's better than nothing, at least

The saviors and the sinners and the mystics won't talk
They shoved all their secrets in a bulletproof box
Sometimes, being human feels like a disease
But it's better than nothing, at least

Sometimes, being human feels like a disease
But it's better than nothing, at least
