It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm gonna make a lot of money
I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach myself to fly
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

He tried hard to help me
He put me at ease
He loved me so naughty
Made me weak in my knees
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
I've lost the best baby
That I ever had
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach myself to fly
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry
I made my baby cry

It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
