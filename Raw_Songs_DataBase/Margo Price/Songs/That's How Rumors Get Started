It's been a while since I've been on this side of town
Don't cross the river much these days
Haven't been avoidin' you, I'm hardly ever around
Sure, we could talk, but what would I say?

And here you are
Still doin' you
Never worked out
But it never stopped you
All I know is every time
That your lips are parted
Right behind my back
That's how rumors get started
That's how rumors get started

Word travels faster than a whisper in the wind
Now all the birds are flyin' south
Black hawks and doves, we are at it once again
And you're talkin' out of both sides of your mouth

And here you are
Still doin' you
It never worked out
But it never stopped you
All I know is every time
That your lips are parted
Right behind my back
That's how rumors get started
That's how rumors get started

You're burnin' bridges, keepin' warm by the fire
For what a lovely glow it makes
I'm growin' tired of being your exit fire
Bet it's hard to sleep in a bed of lies that you made

And here you are
Still doin' you
It never worked out
But it never stopped you
All I know is every time
That your lips are parted
Right behind my back
That's how rumors get started
That's how rumors get started

That's how rumors get started
That's how rumors get started
