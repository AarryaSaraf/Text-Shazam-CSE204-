I'm losing weight, I'm losing sleep
And all the things I just can't keep
I'm losing ground, I'm losing time
But if I lost you I'd lose my mind

I lost my way, I lost my youth
There's not much more I have to lose
I'm losing faith with all my strife
If I lost you I'd lose my life

There's not much here that means a thing
The house, the car, the diamond ring
And all of that, it seems so small
If I lost you I'd lose it all
