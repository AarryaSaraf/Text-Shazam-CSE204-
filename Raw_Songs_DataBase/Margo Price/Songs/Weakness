Sometimes I'm Virginia Woolf
Sometimes I'm James Dean
Sometimes I'm my only friend
And my own worst enemy
My right hand never knows
What my left one's gonna do
But I never meant to cause the harm
That I have done to you

Sometimes I drink beaujolais
Sometimes I drink gin
Sometimes the whiskey does me right
Sometimes it does me in
You've seen all my darkest shades
And everything I've been
Still I can hurt myself much more
Than anyone else can

I'm running for no reason
I'm running and I'm blue
There's no better cure for it
Than being next to you
I can't hide what I am
I guess it's plain to see
Sometimes my weakness is stronger than me
Sometimes my weakness is stronger than me

Sometimes I live in a penthouse
Sometimes I live in a shack
Sometimes I fall off the wagon
Like a train running off the track
But I reckon that I'll jump back on it
Get this monkey off my back
Before I wind up back in prison
Or give myself another heart attack

I'm running for no reason
I'm running and I'm blue
There's no better cure for it
Than being next to you
I can't hide what I am
I guess it's plain to see
Sometimes my weakness is stronger than me
Sometimes my weakness is stronger than me
