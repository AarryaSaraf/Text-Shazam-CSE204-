I get lost in the conversation
Remembering a memory with you
Boredom drives my imagination
Into places I never knew

I want to find what's hiding on the inside
I want to feel reality
Let's go back when everything was all right
I want to ride in a time machine

When did this all go so wrong
I gave you everything
Been waiting around for so long
Nothing is ever going to change

I want to find what's hiding on the inside
I want to feel reality
Let's go back when everything was all right
I want to ride in a time machine

I want to ride in a time machine

I want to find what's hiding on the inside
I want to feel reality
Let's go back when everything was all right
I want to ride in a time machine

I want to ride in a time machine
I want to ride in a time machine
