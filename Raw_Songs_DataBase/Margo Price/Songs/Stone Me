Everybody wants to live in a glass house
I'm rather stay home cause when I go out
I wish I never did
Take me back home, when I was a kid

Sobriety is a hell of a drug
They say you only fight with the people you love
But I won't forget what it's like to be poor
I could be there again, baby that's for sure

Love me, hate me
Desecrate me
Call me a bitch
Then call me baby
You don't know me
You don't own me
Yeah that's no way
To stone me
Yeah that's no way
To stone me

You can pick a side but both are wrong
You can fight the good fight but you're on your own
I used to feel loved but now I feel used
I almost went broke just from paying dues

Through the mud and rain you can drag my name
You can say I've spent my life in vain
But I won't be ashamed of what I am
For your judgement day I don't give a damn

Love me, hate me
Desecrate me
Call me a bitch
Then call me baby
You don't know me
You don't own me
Yeah that's no way
To stone me
Yeah that's no way
To stone me
Yeah that's no way
To stone me
Yeah that's no way
To stone me
