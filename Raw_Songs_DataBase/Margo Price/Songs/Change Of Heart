One of these days
You're gonna wake up older
With a hole in your pocket
And a blade on your shoulder
Well if you break both your legs
Don't come runnin' to me
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart

Don't worry about the war
Nobody's winning
Don't worry about the rain
It's only beginning
I never loved you
And I always will
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart

Get down to the end of the line
When it all fell apart
I quit trying to change your mind
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart

Where are you now
In your pile of rubble
You run from danger
Straight into trouble
Way down deep
You're just as shallow as me
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart

An unwanted child
With an absent mother
You want protection
Like an older brother
I end up forgetting
All the words that you said
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart

Get down to the end of the line
And it all fell apart
I quit trying to change the past
I had a change of heart, oh
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart
I had a change of heart

Oohhhh, oohhh, oohhh
Oohhhh, oohhh, oohhh
Oohhhh
