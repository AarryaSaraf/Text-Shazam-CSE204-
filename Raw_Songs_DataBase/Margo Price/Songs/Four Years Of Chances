Well, I waited four long winters
Yes, I waited in the sun
I was crying all alone
While you were out having fun
I gave you four years of chances
But you threw em all away
I gave you one thousand, four hundred sixty-one days

I gave you four years of chances
To try to be your wife
I cleaned your shirts
And cooked up your supper
But you stayed out late at night
I gave you four years of chances
To try and fill a happy home
But now one more may as well be
A million and one

And now you know you lost me, darling
And you can't get me back
Ain't that just like a man
To change so fast
Because you want what you can't have
So now I'm going to say it slowly
Before I go away
You had me one thousand, four hundred sixty-one days

I gave you four years of chances
To try to be your wife
I cleaned your shirts
And cooked up your supper
But you stayed out late at night
I gave you four years of chances
To try and fill a happy home
But now one more may as well be
A million and one

I found myself a good man now
You know he treats me like he should
We live in a shack by a railroad track
He's out back chopping wood
We don't have have too much money
But I'll tell you why that's okay
He loves me every moment
Of them three hundred sixty-five days

I gave you four years of chances
To try to be be your wife
I cleaned your shirts
And washed up the dishes
But you never did treat me right
I gave you four years of chances
To try and build a happy home
But now one more may as well be
A million and one

But now one more may as well be a million and one
