I think I need to take some time out
And I wanna turn my phone off
I Just wanna be alone
Just let me be alone today
I'm saving all my extra money
Go out get what they'd never buy me
Why do I feel so sick and tired
I'm sick and tired every day

People try to push me around
Run my name straight in the ground
I can't hear them I tuned them out
And I turned them way down low
The only thing I have on is the radio
Only thing I have on is the radio

Don't get confused about how I feel
Don't let them fool you about what is real
I think the whole world's going crazy
And it makes us look insane
But all this thinking makes my head hurt
And all this running makes my feet hurt
I work my back right off my shirt
Kick off my shoes and run away

People try to push me around
Change my face and change my sound
I can't hear them I tuned them out
And I turned them way down low
The only thing I have on is the radio
Only thing I have on is the radio
Only thing I have on is the radio
Only thing I have on is the radio
