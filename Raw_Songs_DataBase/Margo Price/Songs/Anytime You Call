When you walk out on the street
And get shot down by the sun's angry heat
People staring bullet holes in the back of your head
Making you feel much worse than dead
When your skin feels like a cage
And all the good times just seem to be erased
Lonely madness seems to boil inside of you
Like a thief that steals your every move

Anytime you call
I will answer you
You can't find one single friend
I'll come through

We're not as stable as we seem
One small gust of wind could knock down every dream
Frail bodies torn minds and soft hearts exposed
Hidden under our ragged dirty clothes
You've still got that devil grin
Two eyes like searchlights peering out and looking in
Even though you feel like you've got nothing you could show
You've given me more than you could know

Anytime you call
I will answer you
You can't find one single friend
I'll come through

I'll come through
I'll come through
I'll come through
I'll come through
