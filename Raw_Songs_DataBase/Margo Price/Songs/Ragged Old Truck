Early this mornin' without any warnin'
I took me a look at myself
I seen how this married up life I been livin'
Was tryin' to choke me to death
I laid on the bed with my gun to my head
And I nearly 'bout ended it all
But I come to myself just before I got killed
And I blowed me some holes in the wall

I'm thinkin' 'bout crankin' my ragged old truck up
And haulin' myself into town
I'm thinkin' 'bout raisin' so doggone much hell
'Til I'll die 'fore I live it all down
I lay 'round this place 'til I'm blue in the face
And I may as well be underground
I'm thinkin' 'bout crankin' my ragged old truck up
And haulin' myself into town

A honky tonk girl in a honky tonk band
With a honky tonk man on my arm
I may be as ugly as an old mud-rail fence
But I'm loaded with hillbilly charm
It's my plan and no man of mine's gonna tell me
I can't go and have me some fun
So before that old asshole comes back in from Waco
You can bet your rear end I'll be gone

I'm thinkin' 'bout crankin' my ragged old truck up
And haulin' myself into town
I'm thinkin' 'bout raisin' so doggone much hell
'Til I'll die 'fore I live it all down
I lay 'round this place 'til I'm blue in the face
And I may as well be underground
I'm thinkin' 'bout crankin' my ragged old truck up
And haulin' myself into town
I'm thinkin' 'bout crankin' my ragged old truck up
And haulin' myself into town
