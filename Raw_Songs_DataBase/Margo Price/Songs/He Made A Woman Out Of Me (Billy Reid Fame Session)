I was born on a levee
Little bit south of Montgomery
Mama worked in the big house
Daddy, he worked for the county

Never had no learning
Until I turned sixteen
When Joe Henry come up the river
Lord, made a woman outta me (yes, he did)
Lord, he made a woman outta me (yeah)

I used to tease Joe Henry
I guess it served me right
It wasn't long till he left me
Crying out in the night

Joe Henry had his say
He went and set me free
I need to tell everybody
That the man made a woman outta me (yes, he did)
Lord, he made a woman outta me (yeah)

When I think back to that day so long ago
I get a little feeling on my mind
Although it hurt me, there's one thing I know
When he left, he left a woman behind

When I meet another young man
Wanting to love and run (yeah)
Mind goes back to Joe Henry James
And the heck of a job he'd done (uh-huh)

Ain't no other man let me down
You see, I've been set free
Ever since way back yonder
When Joey made a woman outta me (yes, he did)
Lord, he made a woman outta me (made a woman)
Lord, he made a woman outta me (yeah)
Joey made a woman outta me (yes, he did)
Lord, he made a woman outta me
Made a woman outta me (yes he did)
Mmh
