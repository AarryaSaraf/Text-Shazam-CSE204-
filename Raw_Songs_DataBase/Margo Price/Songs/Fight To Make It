You can't win on the very first try
You've got to learn to fall before you fly
They say a woman's place is in the home
Before she disappeared and she proved them wrong

You gotta fight (gotta fight) to make it (gotta fight)
You gotta fight (gotta fight) to make it (gotta fight)
You gotta fight (gotta fight) to make it (gotta fight)
Yes you do

For some it's hard to understand
What it's like to be born with a losing hand
How a dark skinned girl from poverty
Could change the world from a Bama bus seat

Yeah you gotta fight (gotta fight) to make it (gotta fight)
You gotta fight (gotta fight) to make it (gotta fight)
You gotta fight (gotta fight) to make it (gotta fight)
Yes you do

I remember sitting on my daddy's lap
I was four or five or something like that
And I'll never forget what he said to me
Honey, you can be anything you want to be

Yeah you've gotta fight (gotta fight) to make it (gotta fight)
You've gotta fight (gotta fight) to make it (gotta fight)
Yeah you've gotta fight (gotta fight) just to make it (gotta fight)
You've gotta fight fight fight just to make it

Yeah you've gotta fight (gotta fight) to make it (gotta fight)
You've gotta fight (gotta fight) just to make it (gotta fight)
Yeah you've gotta fight (gotta fight) just to make it
Yes you do, yes you do, yes you do, yes you do now

Oh, you do
You gotta fight
Oh yeah
You gotta fight to make it
You gotta fight
