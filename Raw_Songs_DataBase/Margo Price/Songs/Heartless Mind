Should I stay? I believe
If I was wise I would leave
Love's a house that might be haunted
Don't tell me this was what you wanted

Build me up just to tear me down
Sometimes I wonder why I'm still around
You needed shelter, that's what I gave
And summer comfort became a cage

I got a restless feeling that I'm wasting my time
You got a mindless heart, you got a heartless mind
Before you use me, try to treat me kind
You got a heartless mind, you got a heartless mind (Yeah)

Memories runnin' like a jet
Am I that easy to forget?
How could this ever turn out well?
Blind man playing William Tell

I got a restless feeling that I'm wasting my time
You got a mindless heart, you got a heartless mind
Before you use me, try to treat me kind
You got a heartless mind, you got a heartless mind (Yeah)
You got a heartless mind, you got a heartless mind (Yeah)
Oh, oh
