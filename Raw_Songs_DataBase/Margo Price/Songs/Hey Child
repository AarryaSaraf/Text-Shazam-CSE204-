Hey, child, you've got blood
On your doorstep
Long eyes, cheap talk
Strange voices
How long can you hold
Hold down your resistance?
Hey, child, you don't know
No, baby, you don't know your own existence

And in the ruins of the nights that we went
Writin' numbers on our arms
But when you wake up to find there's nothin' left
Don't you know your future's almost gone?

Hey, child, you better get right on you
Hey, child, you got so many better things to do

Hey, child, you've got dogs
Dogs that guard your weakness
Pull in all your wounded men
Oh, baby, don't you know that they're useless?

Your lamp is burnin' low, and the streets are cold and wet
You're just a face without a name
But when you wake up and find there's nothin' left
Oh, honey, baby, ain't it a shame?

Hey, child, you better get it right on you
Hey, child, you got so many better things to do

Hey, child, no, you ain't found it yet
Hey, child, you better quit placin' all those bets
Hey, child, no, no, no, no, no
Hey, child, you're gonna get it right on you
Hey, child (Woah)
