School was done and you were gone so fast
Gave up everything that couldn't last
Borrowed money that you never paid back
And left a hole in this town
They don't make em like you no more
Your mama's working at the liquor store
But we don't talk about it anymore
And you don't come around

Everybody's lonely
Awe babe, just look around

You got away
You got a way
Of letting me down

You were in another dream I had
Still running from your dead beat dad
I had a feeling it would turn out bad
And I never woke up
Bad luck you know it don't come cheap
But shit changes baby, nothing's concrete
A full moon above an empty street
I only wanted your love

Everybody's lonely
Awe babe, just look around

Everybody's lonely
Awe babe, just look around

You got away
You got away
You got a way
Way way
Of letting me down
You keep letting me down
Letting me down
Down down down...
