Once I had a few words left to say
I thought I'd save them for a rainy day
But the clouds are in my mind once again
So long, my friend

We fought on the same side of the line
But the fight and the years were never kind
And we'll never be that green or blue again
So long, my friend

Chasing dreams down the hall
Oh it's a strange life after all
Maybe you'll get one
Before it's done

The sky is filled with UFOs and stars
I hope that you can see 'em where you are
And if you think about me now and then
So long, my friend

Chasing dreams down the hall
Oh it's a strange life after all
Maybe you'll get one
Before it's done

Shoulda known we'd go our separate ways
But I hope the road is treating you okay
When you get back home, or until then
So long, my friend

And if you think about me now and then
So long, my friend
