When I woke up this morning
Something wasn't right
If the truth amounts to nothing
Guess we lost the fight
We've been building something intangible
All we had was faith
Some days I wanna destroy it all
Watch it blow away

You're everything that I want
In someone I don't want anymore
I've been through hell in the heartland
You're everything I want

Ain't it hard to see yourself
When you're looking in the mirror
I'm a hazard to my health
What's behind me isn't clear
Maybe I finally got too high
Now I'm coming down
My mind is like a crooked house
That's burning to the ground

You're everything that I want
In someone I don't want anymore
I've been through hell in the heartland
You're everything I want

In my heart there's a hole
Twice the size of God
Try to fill it up with so many things
But still I just feel lost
Can't please 'em all all the time
And who would want to fake it
Love gets you hurt
Being real gets you hated

You're everything that I want
In someone I don't want anymore
I've been through hell in the heartland
You're everything that I want
In someone I don't want anymore
You're everything that I want
In someone I don't want anymore
You're everything that I want
In someone I don't want anymore
You're everything
