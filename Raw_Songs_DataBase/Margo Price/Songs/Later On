Floods are raging down in Houston
Fires burn in Californ'
Say it's pains of evolution
Maybe the end is being born

But your eyes babe, they're blue and peaceful
But there's something on your mind
Maybe the world is dark and evil
Blind lead the blind

Love and only love could save you
You'll find that out where you go
You'll need it later on
Down the road

See the man with a gun in his hand
Puts his finger on the trigger and pays the cost
Well, what's the reason? Why'd he do it?
If you try to find the answer you'll get lost

Love and only love could save you
You'll find that out where you go
You'll need it later on
Down the road

Now we're living this delusion
When they call it civil lies
I'm just a product of all these products
And the prize that we idolize

Love and only love could save you
You'll find that out where you go
You'll need it later on
Down the road

Need it later on
Down the road
