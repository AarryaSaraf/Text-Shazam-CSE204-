I suppose
The whole town knows
You spend a lotta time on your knees
Like Blackfoot said:
You lie down with dogs
And you wake up with fleas
But you fell behind
Can't play in time
And you're rarely ever sober
So you're close for cash
Diggin' through my trash
For all of my leftovers
All of my leftovers

Like Yesterday's wine
You're past your prime
And you ain't no good for drinkin'
You can have your cake
Eat it too
But baby, that's just wishful thinkin'
So let me say it again
To your new friend
Who's been longing after clover
Like casserole
That asshole
Is all that's leftover
That's just leftovers

Wasn't much there to begin with
That's why I threw it away
You can have whatever's left
I didn't want it anyway
It was leftover, leftover

Hey hey, Honey
Ain't it funny
You're dressin' just like me?
But there's no imagination
In imitation
No that ain't flattery
I don't care
Wanna cut my hair
Change my name again
For to move away
From all those strays
That'll be the end
That'll be the end

Wasn't much there to begin with
That's why I threw it away
You can have whatever's left
I didn't want it anyway
It was leftover, leftover
Leftover, leftover
