The music and the parties
Jack Daniels and speed
Looking for an answer
But a question is what I need
And I only want to ramble
It's the one thing on my mind
I don't want this trouble
But it's all I ever find

Riding down the highway
Masquerading every night
It's hard to be a mother, a singer, and a wife
But all the men they run around and no one bats an eye
I don't want this trouble
But it's all I ever find

Wild women they don't worry
They have no time for the blues
They kill the pain and beat the devil in a hurry
And wild women, no, they don't worry

Every time I slow it down
I always get the blues
I've lost more than most my age but I still got more to lose
I might seem a little crazy when I come to your town
The devil he won't catch me if I drop the hammer down

Wild women they don't worry
They have no time for the blues
They kill the pain and beat the devil in a hurry
Wild women, no, they don't worry
Wild women, no, they don't worry
