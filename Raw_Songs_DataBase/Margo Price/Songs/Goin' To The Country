Livin' in the land of the dead hay
Blind in the burned out street
Garbage everywhere, everybody's fightin'
For a bigger piece of me

Whole thing's lame, it's killin' my brain
Guess it's just who I am
I'll keep goin' on the old dirt road
You can keep the traffic jam

Goin' to the country
Goin' to the country
Gonna lick off milk and honey
And work a piece of land
Blend it in the springtime
Can it for the cold time
Way up on the high-line
Gettin' back to where I been

Hey

Well, I been in the crowd just tryna get out
For a very long time indeed
Lookin' for a home where I can grow
My pretty little wildwood weed

Gonna get me a farm with a horse and a barn
And plant fifteen acres a week
I been livin' off the grid and smokin' on some licks
Come harvest, have a big ol' feast

Yeah, goin' to the country
Goin' to the country
Gonna lick off milk and honey
And work a piece of land
Blend it in the springtime
Can it for the cold time
Way up on the high line
Gettin' back to where I been

Get out in the country
Gettin' back to where I been
