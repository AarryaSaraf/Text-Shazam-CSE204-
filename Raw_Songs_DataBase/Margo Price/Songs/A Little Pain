I'm so tired but I can't sleep
Too many obligations I'm trying to keep
Gotta please everybody except for myself
But like Levon said, "Ain't in it for my health"
Everybody thinks it's all work and no fun

But a little pain never hurt anyone
A little pain never hurt anyone

When I come I home, I've gotta leave
My reality is only make-believe
Someone said it's one or the other
But I'm breaking my back and working like a mother
Who's to say just how it's done?

And a little pain never hurt anyone
A little pain never hurt anyone
A little pain never hurt anyone

Baby, slow down, better hurry up quick
I feel so good that it's making me sick
And I didn't mean to call your phone
I said, I like you the best when I'm all alone
It's been real but I gotta run

And a little pain never hurt anyone
A little pain never hurt anyone
A little pain never hurt anyone
A little pain, a little pain never hurt anyone
