Some folks do and others preach
Some bring sand back to the beach
Some learn hate and others teach
Some don't understand
Some say everything's okay
Some say what all the others say
Some folks give, some take away
Just because they can

All I want, make no mistake
Oh, I don't have a side to take
And I can't live for them, it's true
But honey, I would die for you
I'd die for you

Boards go up, signs come down
Put a new face on this town
Make it smile, make it frown
Just as long as the money's good
Pennies in a woman's hand
Missing teeth, old payment plans
Kids want something worth a damn
Oh, they're just pissing in a flood

But all I want, let's make it clear
Oh, I'm not tryna make a lie sincere
To myself, I may be untrue
But honey, I would die for you
I'd die for you

Some go low, some get high
Some get drunk on wasted time
Some say yours, some say mine
But we all bleed the same blood
Naked streets of Babylon
Silver ships out in the dawn
Rob the graves we landed on
Or they'll be washed out in the mud

But all I want, make no mistake
Oh, I don't have a side to take
And I can't live for them, it's true
But honey, I would die for you
Oh baby, I would die for you
I would die for you
I'd die for you
