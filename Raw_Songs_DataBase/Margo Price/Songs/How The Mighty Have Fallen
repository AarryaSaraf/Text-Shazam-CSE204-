You thought you'd see
How green the grass it grew
On the other side
That divides me from you
You said I held you back
From bigger things
Now that you're running wild
You're running back to me

How the mighty have fallen
Like they do every time
And to me you come crawling
With your crown at your side
You were high on your mountain
Now it's back to the farm
How the mighty have fallen
Right back into my arms

I never meant to keep you
From being you
But I know that's an easier thing
To say than do
You brushed me off
And said I'd never grow
Now that you're on your knees
You're smaller than before

How the mighty have fallen
Like they do every time
And to me you come crawling
With your crown at your side
You were high on your mountain
Now it's back to the farm
How the mighty have fallen
Right back into my arms

How the mighty have fallen
Right back into my arms
