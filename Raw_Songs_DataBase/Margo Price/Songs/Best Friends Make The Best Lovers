It's a great big world with a million kinds of lovers
Rough, gentle, sloppy, and quick
You've got boyfriends, girlfriends, long-term whirlwinds
An ex that's a total prick
Some of them are cool, some of them are fools
And some are strangers in a bathroom stall
When it comes to pure pleasure, any kind of measure
There's one kind of lover that's the best of them all

Best friends make the best lovers
Banging with your buddy's the best
When you got love and affection underneath the covers
Baby, you'll forget the rest

So lovers might feed your primal need
But they'll leave you with a dull remorse
But when you're getting slutty with your number one buddy
It's the best of all worlds, it's a powerful force

Best friends make the best lovers
It's satisfaction to your core
'Cause when you love who you're loving you never want another
Baby, that's what friends are for
Best friends make the best lovers
Getting busy with your buddy's the best
When you add trust and affection to your carnal connection
Baby, you'll forget the rest
Baby, you'll forget the rest
Baby, you'll forget the rest
