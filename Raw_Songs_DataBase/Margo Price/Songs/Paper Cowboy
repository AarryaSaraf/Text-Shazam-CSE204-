Well you're nothing but a paper cowboy
Made out of glue and old news
And all your bravado and your drug-dealing ways
That only gives us the blues

Well you're nothing but a paper cowboy
Made out of glue and old news
And all your bravado and your drug-dealing ways
Well that only gives us the blues

You're always out talking a good game
With your cronies, your clowns, and your dogs
All of the things that you say you'll do
Well a million-to-one says you won't

So lay down your guns
They were never loaded anyhow
With your high-dollar boots
And your trash-talking mouth
This town has no use for you now

When everyone gets on to your tricks
Where in the hell are you gonna go?
Can't say that you've got nothing to prove
Baby, when you've got nothing show

Because you're nothing but a paper cowboy
So fade away like a good cowboy should
With your pony, the reigns, hell on the plains
And you can tell them you was misunderstood

So lay down your guns
They were never loaded anyhow
With your high-dollar boots
And your trash-talking mouth
Oh this town has no use for you now
Said this town has no use for you now
