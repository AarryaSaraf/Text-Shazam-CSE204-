You spend an awful lot of time in Massachusetts
Seems like every other week you've got a meeting waiting there
Business must be booming or could something else
Be moving in the air up there

You say that it's important for our future
An executive on his way up has got to play the part
And each time duty calls you got to give it all
You've got with all your heart

When whoever's in New England's through with you
And Boston finds better things to do
You know it's not too late 'cause you'll always have a place to come back to
When whoever's in New England's through with you

I hear the winter time up north can last forever
And I've been told it's beautiful to see this time of year
They say the snow can blind you till the world you left behind
Just disappears I hear

I packed your bags and left them in the hallway
But before you leave again there's just one thing you outta know
When the icy wind blows through you remember that it's me
Who feels the cold most of all

When whoever's in New England's through with you
And Boston finds better things to do
You know it's not too late and you'll always have a place to come back to
When whoever's in New England's through with you
