Album: TheLastOneToKnow

// The Last One To Know //

I didn't see the fire burn to ashes

Couldn't feel the winds of change

I was lost inside the passion

Blinded by a memory of a flame


Guess I should of felt it when you touched me

Should of seen it in your eyes

I beleived you really loved me

Why can't i beleive you said goodbye


Why is the last one to know

The first one to cry and the last to let go

Why is the one left behind the one left alone

With no one to hold

The last one to know


Now it would be easier to face the morning

If you were holding me tonight

But you left me without a warning

Holding on to a heartache while she's holding you tight


Why is the last one to know

The first one to cry and the last to let go

Why is the one left behind the one left alone

With no one to hold

The last one to know

// The Girl Who Has Everything //

I just got the wedding invitation.

There's gonna be a celebration like you've never seen.

Just fit for a queen.

She's got her mom and daddy's blessing.

She's got a long white wedding dress and his wedding ring.


Oh what can I bring.

What do you give the girl who has everything.

She's got the man who used to hold me.

She's got the man who told me I was his everything.

She's got the man who used to love me, who placed no one above me.

How he made my heart sing.

Oh what can I bring.

What do you give the girl who has everything.


She'll hear his promise of forever.

She'll hear him say what I could never get him to say.

Oh he'll say it today.

She'll hold his hand and throw the flowers.

Drink champagne till the morning hours.

The queen has her king, and the world on a string.


So what do you give the girl who has everything.

She's got the man who used to hold me.

She's got the man who told me I was his everything.

She's got the man who used to love me, who placed no one above me.

How he made my heart sing.

Oh what can I bring.

Tell me what do you give the girl who has everything.

What do you give the girl who has everything.

// Just Across The Rio Grande //

The lights of Laredo dance on the water and shine in a young man's eyes.

Who stand on the border and dreams of paradise.

He's heard crazy stories of how people live over in the promised land.

He heard they eat three meals a day, just across the Rio Grande.

He's got a wife named Maria, and a baby named Rose, and another one to feed on the way.

Two willing hands, that couldn't find work today.

He stares at the river and curses the future, that he can't understand.

He knows the child would have a chance, just across the Rio Grande.


It's only a river, that's not so deep or wide.

A boy can throw a stone across and reach the other side.

It's just some muddy water, cutting through the land.

But a man can make a dream come true just across the Rio Grande.


The lights of Laredo dance on the water and shine in a young man's eyes.

Who stand on the border and dreams of paradise.

He's heard crazy stories of how good life is over in the promised land,

and sometimes it seems like God must live just across the Rio Grande.


It's only a river, that's not so deep or wide.

A boy can throw a stone across and reach the other side.

It's just some muddy water, cutting through the land.

But a man can make a dream come true just across the Rio Grande.

Sometimes it seems like God must live just across the Rio Grande.

// I Don't Want To Mention Any Names //

I've got a story to tell, would you mind listening.

I can always count on you we're such good friends.

And I need to talk about my situation and you're the only one who'll understand.

Now someone's got designs on my baby.

She's making her intentions very plain.

We both know this ole gal that I'm talking about, but I don't want to mention any names.


Well she's asked him to slow dance way too often.

She's made suggestions I don't like at all.

I'm trying to let her know that I'm wise to her game, but I don't wanna mention any names.


Well I can understand why she'd want him.

Oh you've even said yourself he's quite a prize.

She's about a good of friend as you are.

Come to think about it she's just about your size.

If she don't back off there's gonna be some trouble.

I'm prepared to make that very plain.

I sure hope I've said enough, and just between the two of us.

Cause I don't wanna mention any names.


Well she's asked him to slow dance way too often.

She's made suggestions I don't like at all.

I'm trying to let her know that I'm wise to her game, but I don't wanna mention any names.

Well, I'm trying to let her know that I'm wise to her game, but I don't wanna mention any names.

// Someone Else //

I know that you've seen love walk out the door once or twice.

I know that you've seen it all, waiting by the telephone, you didn't get the call.

Well baby let me tell ya, you're looking at me with suspicious eyes, but they'll never be confirmed.


If there was someone else I wouldn't be here now.

Cause you're the only one I want my arms around.

And I'm telling you the truth and now I'll tell ya why.

If there was someone else I'd be with him tonight.


No time for doubts, I'm gonna turn your heart around.

Think about you everyday.

Gonna make you understand my love is here to stay.

We've got something going that's so hard to find.

You are the one, the only one that's on my mind.


If there was someone else I wouldn't be here now.

Cause you're the only one I want my arms around.

And I'm telling you the truth, and now I'll tell ya why.


If there was someone else I'd be with him tonight.

Oh, if there was someone else I wouldn't be here now.

Cause you're the only one I want my arms around.

And I'm telling you the truth and now I'll tell ya why.

If there was someone else I'd be with him tonight.

// What You Gonna Do About Me //

You take the records, I'll take the stereo.

You get the tv, and I'll take the radio.

I'll keep the dishes, and you the pots and pans.

You'll need a new car more than me, so I'll take the second hand.

We'll each keep our own friends, divide the rest in two.

The only kids seem to understand, still there's one thing left to do.

It's over in the corner, our little one sits and cries.

And behind that swell of tears she's asking with her eyes.


What you gonna do about me,

What you gonna do about me.

Is it daddy on the weekend, mama rest of the week.

Will I have to make new friends, live on a different street.

Who's gonna be the one who tucks me into sleep.

Oh what you gonna do, what you gonna do about me.


I gave her a hug, she pushed me away.

I said in time you'll understand, and maybe we both will someday.

I wiped her tears, and said "It won't be so bad.", she said "Will you still be my mommy, will he still be my dad?"


What you gonna do about me,

What you gonna do about me.

Is it daddy on the weekend, mama rest of the week.

Will I have to make new friends, live on a different street.

Who's gonna be the one who tucks me into sleep.

Oh what you gonna do, what you gonna do about me.


How can I tell her when I dont' know for sure

Why her mom and dad don't love each other anymore.

// I Don't Want To Be Alone //

My nerves are shot, the coffee's cold.

Wish that I could be so bold as to walk right up to you and say what I think.

I don't now what you think of me.

And I know everyone can see I'm crazy about you and always will be.

Where's women's lib when you need it the most.

Or what is mama who said you're not suppose to flaunt yourself like that as to no in between.

Or maybe it's not that I'm afraid, it's just that the last move I made

Embarrased me to death and made me want to hide.

So if you've ever been embarrased before meet me half way and I'll know for sure.

At least we'll still be friends if I mess up again.

Cause it ain't easy meeting someone new.

Especially when that someone is you.

It ain't easy by being by yourself.

It's no fun to be alone, and I don't want to be alone.

Cause it ain't easy meeting someone new.

Especially when that someone is you.

It ain't easy by being by yourself.

It's no fun to be alone, and I don't want to be alone.

My nerves are shot, the coffee's cold.

Wish that I could be so bold as to walk right up to you and say what I think.

// The Stairs //

She looks at the clock, it's a quarter past nine.

She hears his car as he pulls in the drive.

Dinner's still waiting from hours before.

She knows he's been drinking when he walks through the door.

In anger he strikes out and she starts to cry.

How much more can she take, how much more can she lie.


And she fell down the stair again.

But it hasn't happened since she don't know when.

Was it in spring when she packed up the kids, or maybe in winter with his job on the skids.

Oh but just like before she'll have to pretend that she fell down the stairs again.


A short time ago, she started a job, serving chicken fried steak and corn on the cob.

She started out shy, but she ended up sure, that a ticket to anywhere could be the cure.

But he couldn't handle her change for the better.

She tried to leave him, but he wouldn't let her.

He says he's sorry, he'd never mean it.

He swears it won't happen again.

But she's so confused, she wants to believe it.

She just wants this nightmare to end.


And she fell down the stair again.

But it hasn't happened since she don't know when.

Was it in spring when she packed up the kids, or maybe in winter with his job on the skids.

Oh but just like before she'll have to pretend that she fell down the stairs again.

// Love Will Find Its Way To You //

Another morning, another day in your life without someone there by you.

You had a dream again last night.

You wonder why the dream just won't come true.


So what ya gonna do.

Walk around with your head hung down.

Maybe that's the reason you've never found the one for you,

So you've got to let your love shine through your eyes, your smile.

You've got to let somebody know how you feel inside your heart.

You'll find, somebody wants to be a part of your life.

And if you just believe and say that's what you're gonna do,

One day love will find its way to you.

Yes it will.

One day love will find its way to you.


Another party, and all your friends are smiles.

Oh you might meet someone new.

And being close would be so nice.

In this life the chances are so few.


So what ya gonna do.

Walk around with your head hung down.

Maybe that's the reason you've never found the one for you,

So you've got to let your love shine through you eyes, your smile.

You've got to let somebody know how you feel inside your heart.

You'll find, somebody wants to be a part of your life.

And if you just believe and say that's what you're gonna do,

One day love will find its way to you.

Oh yes it will.

One day love will find its way to you.


Don't you think you're the only one.

Oh somewhere in the world there's a lonely heart looking for someone.

You've got to let your love shine through you eyes, your smile.

You've got to let somebody know how you feel inside your heart.

You'll find, somebody wants to be a part of your life cause your eyes, your smile.

You've got to let somebody know how you feel inside.

Somebody wants to be a part of your life.

// I've Still Got The Love We Made //

You know I can't find the letters you wrote to me in school.

And that shoebox full of photographs got lost in my last move.

I gave away that old twin bed where you and I first laid.

But after all this time, I've still got the love we made.

And that old beat up car we dated in, finally turned to rust.

And the first rose that you gave me, oh it finally turned to dust.

But all those tender nights we shared are never gonna fade.

Cause after all this time I've still got the love we made.

I've got every feeling we felt when touched.

Cause even though fell apart I kept a part of us.

I've held on to everytime we held each other tight,

And promised that no matter what we'd never say goodbye.

I don't have one souvenier of us I'd meant to save,

But right here in my heart I've still got the love we made.

Ooh right here in my heart I've still got the love we made.
