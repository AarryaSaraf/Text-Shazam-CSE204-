// Love Isn't Love (Til You Give It Away) //

Smile's not a smile until it wrinkles your face

Bell's not a bell without ringing

A home's not a home when there's nobody there

A song's not a song without singing


Love isn't love till you give it away

Love isn't love till it's free

The love in your heart

Wasn't put there to stay

Oh love isn't love till you give it away


You might think love is a treasure to keep

Feeling to cherish and hold

But love is a treasure for people to share

You keep it by letting it go


Love isn't love till you give it away

Love isn't love till it's free

The love in your heart

Wasn't put there to stay

Oh love isn't love till you give it away


Cause love can't survive

When it's hidden inside

And love was meant to be shared


Love isn't love till you give it away

Love isn't love till it's free

The love in your heart

Wasn't put there to stay

Oh love isn't love till you give it away

// Is It Really Love //

They say that it's the same the whole world over

That love's the hardest thing to understand

I thought once in love my troubles would blow over

But it seems that's when the heartache just begins


And I remember when you first said that you love me

I tried not to let the words go to my head

The things you said you spoke so sincerely

Somewhere in between the lines of red


Is it really love

Is it really love

Or just my heart playing tricks on me

I fall so easily

Is my heart telling me

That I'm your fool

Or is it really love


This time love's got me feeling so uncertain

My heart's seen all the breaks that it can take

I can't tell you if this is just infatuation

Or another chance to learn from my mistakes


Is it really love

Is it really love

Or just my heart playing tricks on me

I fall so easily

Is my heart telling me

That I'm your fool

Or is it really love


I'm a little bit leary

Of the love 'em and leave 'em behind kind

I'm just a little bit weary

Cause other lovers like messing with my mind

Oh all the time


Is it really love

Is it really love

Or just my heart playing tricks on me

I fall so easily

Is my heart telling me

That I'm your fool

Or is it really love


Am I your fool

Or is it really love

// Reasons //

I prefer yellow roses to daisies

I'll take the mountains over a postcard view

I'll order steaks every time instead of hot dogs

That's why I chose him over you


I like to love somebody handsome rather than ugly

I like happiness instead of being blue

I like to talk real late at night after making love

And that's the reasons I chose him over you


Well I don't know how I ever did without him

And I don't understand why I put up with you

Well I know that the sun shines the brightest when you're happy


So go ahead and think just what you want to

But I promise what I just told you is true

Oh I love him so much and he loves me too

And that's the reasons I chose him over you


Just some of the reasons I chose him over you

Oh over you

// Nickel Dreams //

A little girl's dream world with ribbons and long curls

Reflections of yesterday's past

Now headlines and foot lights

The hours of long nights keep everything

Moving so fast


It's taken a long time

And she's walked a thin line

The fame and fortune arrived


She kept on striving

Way of surviving

Till part of those dreams came alive


And she wishes she looks like

They tell her she looks like all the time

What she'd give just to feel like

She tells them she's feeling

Just fine

All that money she makes every night

Ain't as much as it seems

A dollar a wrinkle and less then a nickel a dream


Her heart may be breaking

But she keeps on taking

What she thought she wanted way back when

It's too late to change her

There's always a stranger

To tell her she's someone again


And she wishes she looks like

They tell her she looks like all the time

What she'd give just to feel like

She tells them she's feeling

Just fine

All that money she makes every night

Ain't as much as it seems

A dollar a wrinkle and less then a nickel a dream


Nickel a dream

Nickel dreams

// One Good Reason //

You said you were out with a friend

Well your friend left her lipstick in your car again

That mark on your neck didn't get there from shaving

I got a feeling you've been misbehaving


So give me one good reason why I should stay

Just one good reason not to walk away

Must be open season on cheating man-a-tease

And why do you do me this way

Just give me one good reason to stay

And I'll stay


You tell me your love is true

Well is that what you tell all the other girls too

You can't tell the truth babe

You're not even trying

I got a feeling you're just alibing


So give me one good reason why I should stay

Just one good reason not to walk away

Must be open season on cheating man-a-tease

And why do you do me this way

Just give me one good reason to stay

And I'll stay


So give me one good reason why I should stay

Just one good reason not to walk away

Must be open season on cheating man-a-tease

And why do you do me this way

Just give me one good reason to stay

And I'll stay


So give me one good reason why I should stay

Just one good reason not to walk away

Must be open season on cheating man-a-tease

And why do you do me this way

Just give me one good reason to stay

And I'll stay


So give me one good reason why I should stay

Just one good reason not to walk away

Must be open season on cheating man-a-tease

And why do you do me this way

Just give me one good reason to stay

And I'll stay

// You Really Better Love Me After This //

Your letter found me here in Denver

I've changed though since I've been here

I've learned there's more to life

Than your promises


There's someone here

In Colorado

Who won't forget tomorrow

So you really better love me after this


On a bus somewhere in Kansas

Heading home to take my chances

Lord I hope this time you mean

The things you say


I won't say this is the last time

And let you play with my mind

But you really better love me after this


Cause after all the pain we've been through

After all the chances we blew

Doesn't really mean that much to you

But you really better love me


As the bus pulls in the station

I can see you waiting

And I believe we both forget

What we can't forgive


Now we're holding to each other

I can feel my heart recover

And I know you'll gonna love me after this


Cause after all the pain we've been through

After all the chances we blew

I guess we really mean that much to you

Oh you're really gonna love you

Oh you're really gonna love me

Oh you're really gonna love me

// There Ain't No Future In This //

Honey I know you tried

When you loved me tonight

But the memory slipped from your lips

So if she's on your mind

That much of the time

There ain't no future in this


There was somebody who

Took a whole lot of you

And I guess you're not over it yet

If I'm just

Standing in for a memory then

There ain't no future in this


Cause mine are the arms that hold you

Hers are the arms you miss

So if she's still the one

When it's all said and done

There ain't no future in this


So if she's still the one

When it's all said and done

There ain't no future in this

// Why Do We Want (What We Know We Can't Have) //

Some come for the music

Some for romance

You gotta be with the boy that brought you to the dance

Then across the room comes a casual glance

And you be making some dime even half the chance


Now some like to look

And some like to touch

All the things that they can't have

Way too much

Some like to get real close to the flame

once you feel the heat

You know they're never the same


Why do we want

What we know we can't have

Why don't we want

What's in the palm of our hands

Why we always looking

At what's just out of our grasp

Why do we want

What we know we can't have


Well Susie was out driving her new corvette

She hadn't made that second payment yet

She rear ended a Semi

But not by choice

She was a rubbernecking a new Rolls Royce


Why do we want

What we know we can't have

Why don't we want

What's in the palm of our hands

Why we always looking

At what's just out of our grasp

Why do we want

What we know we can't have


Why do we want

What we know we can't have

Why don't we want

What's in the palm of our hands

Why we always looking

At what's just out of our grasp

Why do we want

What we know we can't have

// I Sacrificed More Than You'll Ever Lose //

I fed the children

And I kissed them goodnight

You fed the jukebox

Till they turn out the lights

I bought the bacon

While you bought the booze

I've sacrificed more than you'll ever lose


Needing new clothes with the money you spent

On barbills and motels and women you met

But I stood the heartache that you put me through

I've sacrificed more than you'll ever lose


I gave up so much

And now I'm giving up you

It's too late to make up for

The love that you used


I've had enough

I don't want you around

Don't look at me

Like I let you down

You say I'm to blame

But who's fooling who

I've sacrificed more than you'll ever lose

Yeah I sacrificed more than you'll ever lose

// Pins And Needles //

Pins and needles

Needles and pins

One by one I feel them at my heart again

I think I'm getting over you and then

Pins and needles

Needles and pins


I don't know why

I get uneasy

Every time I hear your name

I feel a sting from every memory

That we made


Pins and needles

Needles and pins

One by one I feel them at my heart again

I think I'm getting over you and then

Pins and needles

Needles and pins


That tiny ache

Can always find me

Anytime that you are near

Those little things

Can still remind me

That you don't care


Pins and needles

Needles and pins

One by one I feel them at my heart again

I think I'm getting over you and then

Pins and needles

Needles and pins


(Pins and needles

Pins and needles

Pins and needles

Needles and pins)
