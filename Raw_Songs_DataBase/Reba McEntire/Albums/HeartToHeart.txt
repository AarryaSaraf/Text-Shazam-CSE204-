Album: HeartToHeart

// Indelibly Blue //

Lost in the city

Deserted and cold

Watching the cars passing by

There all going places

That we used to go

And it's driving me out of my mind


And it's making me blue

Indelibly blue

I can't erase the memories of me and you

Indelibly blue


They say when one love is ended

Another is born

That's no consolation to me

Just show me some sunlight

A rose without thorns

And maybe I'll start to believe


And it's making me blue

Indelibly blue

I can't erase the memories of me and you

Indelibly blue

Well just color me blue


Oh all my life

I've waited for one love to make it alright

But now I feel heartaches and tears

Of a sad souvenirs that you left me

Since you left me

I'll just go on a day at a time

Trying in vain to forget you

But time and again you enter my mind

Someday I swear I won't let you


And it's making me blue

Indelibly blue

I can't erase the memories of me and you

Indelibly blue

Cause baby I'm blue


And it's making me blue

Indelibly blue

I can't erase the memories of me and you

Indelibly blue

So just color me blue

// Ease The Fever //

No need talking

I can't see it

Someone set your heart on fire

Now she's gone and all she left is hurt

Lots of burning sweet desire


So let me ease the fever and erase the pain

Let me make a believer out of you again

Hold me close and let me love the tears away

Let me ease the fever and erase the pain


Let your tears fall on my shoulder

Let your arms around me tight

Yesterday is gone forever

Let's make tomorrow start tonight


So let me ease the fever and erase the pain

Let me make a believer out of you again

Hold me close and let me love the tears away

Let me ease the fever and erase the pain


So let me ease the fever and erase the pain

Let me make a believer out of you again

Hold me close and let me love the tears away

Let me ease the fever and erase the pain


So let me ease the fever and erase the pain

Let me make a believer out of you again

Hold me close and let me love the tears away

Let me ease the fever and erase the pain

// There Ain't No Love //

As we sit out on the back porch

And the night begins to show

It feels good just to be here and unwind

And the sun is slowly setting

A reflection in your eyes

And when you look my way

I have to say

The thought that's crossed my mind


And you know there ain't no love

There ain't no love like yours for me

And it's plain my love

You've been heaven sent made specially

There ain't no love

There ain't no love like yours for me

And we'll remain in love

With the kind of love

Most lovers never see


You always sit and listen

When I feel the need to talk

When I'm feeling insecure and filled with doubt

You've got the way to make me happy

And it's right there in your smile

And love for me will always be what I can't do without


And you know there ain't no love

There ain't no love like yours for me

And it's plain my love

You've been heaven sent made specially

There ain't no love

There ain't no love like yours for me

And we'll remain in love

With the kind of love

Most lovers never see


There ain't no love like yours for me

And it's plain my love

You've been heaven sent made specially

There ain't no love

There ain't no love like yours for me

We'll remain in love..

// How Does It Feel To Be Free //

How did it happen

When did we lose it

The love we looked for so long

I'm sorry I called you

But it's the first night you see

How does it feel to be free


How does it feel now

To reach out for someone

And find there's nobody there

Is it weighing on you

Cause it's sure killing me

Tell me how does it feel to be free


Funny how love is so hard to find

And yet so easy to lose

Maybe in time this old heart of mine

Can learn to be free without you


How did it happen

When did we lose it

The love we looked for so long

I'm sorry I called you

But I just have to see

How does it feel to be free


I'm sorry I called you

But it's the first night you see

Now how does it feel to be free

// Only You (And You Alone) //

Only you

Can make this world seem bright

Only you

Can make the darkness bright

Only you and you alone

Can thrill me like you do

And fill my heart with love

For only you


Only you

Can make this change in me

For it's true

You are my destiny

When you hold my hand

I understand

The magic that you do

You're my dream come true

My one and only you


Oh, oh, only you

Can make this change in me

For it's true

You are my destiny

When you hold my hand

I understand

The magic that you do

You're my dream come true

My one and only you

// Today All Over Again //

Is this how it is when it's over

Between a woman and a man

Must tomorrow just keep on being

Today all over again


You made it look so easy

Falling for somebody new

But I must be going about it all wrong

For I just can't stop loving you


Is this how it is when it's over

Between a woman and a man

Must tomorrow just keep on being

Today all over again


This morning I reached out to touch you

A habit I've held for so long

But I just started hurting all over again

Like I have ever since you've been gone


Is this how it is when it's over

Between a woman and a man

Must tomorrow just keep on being

Today all over again


Today all over again

// Gonna Love Ya (Till The Cows Come Home) //

// Who? //

Who...who's gonna love ya like I do

Who...who ya gonna find that can do the things that I do

Before you say goodbye

You better think about it one more time

And tell me who...who ever held you any tighter

Who...who ya gonna find that can take you any higher

Before you put me down

You better stop and look around

And tell me who...who-who


Well you might just find a match that can kindle your desires

But what good is just one candle

When what you need is fires


And tell me who...who-who-who

Who...who-who/who...who-who


Before I let you go

One thing I've got to know

So tell me who

Who's gonna love ya like I do

Who...who-Who

Who you gonna find that can do the things that I do

Who...who-Who

Who ever held you any tighter

Who...who-Who

Who ya gonna find that can do the things that I do

// Small Two-Bedroom Starter //

The house stood empty on a corner

Waiting for a brand new owner

A soldier off to war who had to leave his bride alone


She couldn't buy too many nice things

On a GI bill and daydreams

But she tried until they told her

He was never coming home


Small two bedroom starter

Needs a little fixing

A great big yard for kids and pets to play

This one won't last too long

It's close to schools and churches

Owner leaving town

You better hurry down today


Bought by the high school teacher

Sold it to a baptist preacher

Who couldn't pay his taxes

Cause his flock had gone astray

So the banker fenced the yard in

Planted trees and half a garden

The man from Dallas kept it up

Till he moved away


Small two bedroom starter

Needs a little fixing

A great big yard for kids and pets to play

This one won't last too long

It's close to schools and churches

Owner leaving town

You better hurry down today


You and I we built the playroom

For the baby that came too soon

Spent money that we didn't have

Trying to make this place our own


Lord it makes me feel like dying

After all these years of trying

Honey we'll just bought this house

That we can't seem to make a home


Small two bedroom starter

Needs a little fixing

A great big yard for kids and pets to play

This one won't last too long

It's close to schools and churches

Owner leaving town

You better hurry down today


Small two bedroom starter

Waiting for a brand new owner

// Love By Love //

You found me down

Hurting bad from his memory

And I thought love and I were really through


But you reached out

And touched my heart so tenderly

You gave me life

Gave me hope

Made me blue


Touch by touch

You're taking the hurt away

Smile by smile

A little more everyday

Heart to heart

You're helping me find a way

To what I once dreamed of

Kiss by kiss

You're making love sweet again

Step by Step

Back on my feet again

Thanks to you

Feeling complete again

Yes you filled me up

Love by love


We're lying here

Loving the feeling morning brings

His memory's fading more with every dawn

Cause like the sun

Your love's so warm and gentle thing

Drives my tears

Lights my way

Leaves me up


Touch by touch

You're taking the hurt away

Smile by smile

A little more everyday

Heart to heart

You're helping me find a way

To what I once dreamed of

Kiss by kiss

You're making love sweet again

Step by Step

Back on my feet again

Thanks to you

Feeling complete again

Yes you filled me up

Love by love


Touch by touch

You're taking the hurt away

Smile by smile

A little more everyday

Heart to heart

You're helping me find a way

To what I once dreamed of

Kiss by kiss

You're making love sweet again

Step by Step

Back on my feet again

Thanks to you

Feeling complete again

Yes you filled me up

Love by love
