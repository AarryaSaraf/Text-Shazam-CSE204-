Part two feels like spring
I guess the shit just makes you boring
Got money, I don't care about sex
You knew I would take it
You brought her to flex

Sucker for the pain, oh honey
But you said you'd die
You're gonna leave a stain
Like a relapse does when you really try
Damn, this time I really tried

Lived on, but nothing feels true
Sometimes I hate her just for not being you
Post rehab, I've been feeling so small
I miss your attention, I wish I could call

Sucker for the pain, oh honey
But you said you'd die
You're gonna leave a stain forever
But you said you'd die
Said you would have died for me

Raised your voice to me
Second time, I had to make myself believe
I deserve it, I'm crazy
But don't act like you never met me

I never should have hurt you
I've got the devil in me
I've got the devil in me
I've got the devil in me

Sucker for the pain, oh honey
But you said you'd die
You're gonna leave a stain forever
But you said you'd die
Said you would have died for me
