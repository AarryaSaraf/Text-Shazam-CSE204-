Quiet hours
Nothing now
Always an absence
Drowned out
What if instead
No one hears what's unsaid
No one can take away
Only the blue lights
Nothing but green sky
Glow of the bug light
How they always fly
To fluorescent heights

I can't see me in my own my eyes
Only boxes to run and hide
Five AM and I know it now
I need to find a way out
No one can take away
Only the blue lights
Nothing but green sky
I lose myself every night
To fluorescent heights
I want to be alright
Fluorescent heights
