Good future
Get a life
Get a job
Get a clue

Thought it would be so much fun
Just played another solo run
Fifteen hippies drinkin' Coors
Yelling at us to play "Free Bird"
Needless to say, all of our pay
went into the tank

I am better than you
You are a piece of poo
I am better than you
You are a piece of poo

Thought school would be such a blast
Just flunked another fucking class
Told myself too many lies
My mind's unfolding before my eyes
Now I know how it goes
What it means to go crazy
