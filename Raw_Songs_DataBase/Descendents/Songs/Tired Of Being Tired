Tired of being tired, bored of being bored
Tired of being stared at, tired of being ignored
By you

Tired of being sick, sick of being sane
You're so stupid, you don't know it's gonna rain
On you

I don't know what I'm gonna do
Guess I have to get away from you

Tired of being tired, bored of being bored
Tired of being stared at, tired of being ignored
By you
By you
By you
