It's been so long since I had a smile
I've stayed sad for such a long while
If you can cheer me up I could learn to love you
You kiss me now and I turn away
I think I'm still kissing yesterday
If you can cheer me up I could learn to love you

So love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Cheer me up
Come on and cheer me up

Don't want to spend the rest of my days
Dreaming yesterday's daydreams

Out with the bad and in with the good
You feel my heart, girl, you're knocking on wood
If you can cheer me up I could learn to love you
So generous, I'm being kind
With selfishness in the back of my mind
If you can cheer me up I could learn to love you

So love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Cheer me up
Come on and cheer me up

Don't want to spend the rest of my days
Dreaming yesterday's daydreams
Don't want to spend the rest of my days
Giving yesterday's promises

It's been so long since I had a smile
I've stayed sad for such a long while
If you can cheer me up I could learn to love you
No more giving my mind away
Tomorrow's love will be yesterday
If you can cheer me up I could learn to love you

So love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Love me, and cheer me up
Show me you're the one who can make me happy
Cheer me up
Come on and cheer me up

Don't want to spend the rest of my days
Dreaming yesterday's daydreams
Don't want to spend the rest of my days
Giving yesterday's promises
Don't want to spend the rest of my days
Living yesterday
Don't want to spend the rest of my days
Singing yesterday's love songs
