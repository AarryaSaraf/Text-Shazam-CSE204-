Yeah the world just kicked my ass again
Old news, it's the same way it's ever been

Just like before
Sprawling senseless
To the floor
With no defenses

Don't have the time to be angry
I'll use my mind, find out how they beat me

Not like before
I'll learn some new tricks
I'm gonna school
The sonsabitches

We got defeat, but I'm learning
We got defeat - I'm determined
We got defeat - I'll return and
I'll beat 'em next time

Winning never taught anybody anything
Underdogs get the bone eventually

Not like before
I think I got this
I'm gonna school
The sonsabitches

We got defeat, but I'm learning
We got defeat - I'm determined
We got defeat - I'll return and
I'll beat 'em next time
