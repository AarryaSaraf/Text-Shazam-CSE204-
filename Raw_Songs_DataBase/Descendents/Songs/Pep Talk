It's not the end of the world
Since your baby left you
It's gonna be okay
You don't need her anyway

You're looking around for someone to love
So you don't have to face the world alone
But give it some time and you might find
That you're better off on your own
Cause you could be dead right now
You could be the stupidest thing in the world
But you're not, look at what you've got
And stop thinking about that girl

You deserve the best, but it's up to you to get it
Don't settle for less, you know you're gonna regret it

It's not the end of the world
Since your baby left you
It's gonna be okay
You don't need her anyway

Watching the tube, moping around
Might as well be six feet underground
You're watching the game go by
Waiting for the final score
You got the beer commercials memorized
So you've probably heard this before
But this ain't the TV talking to you
It's a friend who's gonna tell you what you can do

You deserve the best, but it's up to you to get it
Don't settle for less, you're the best and don't you forget it

I know what you're thinking... you'll never find another
And even if you did, well, you couldn't love her
But out there somewhere is the person, place or thing
That you need to make you believe in you

It's not the end of the world
Since your baby left you
It's gonna be okay
You can find something better anyway

Just take your time. and you will find
What your life requires
Just take your time. and you will find
What your heart desires
Just take your time. and you will find
You will find
