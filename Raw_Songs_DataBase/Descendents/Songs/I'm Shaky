Last night, I made love to my radio
Last night, I curled up in bed with my canary

Sure was fun (I guess I'm pretty shaky)
Sure was fun (I guess I'm pretty shaky)
It sure was fun, I guess I'm pretty weird
To you, to you
To you, to you

But we're all weird down deep inside
And we're all strange, indeed
Why is it so? The parts we hide
In order to keep our foolish pride

Last night, I gave head to my microphone
Last night, I curled up in bed with my canary

Sure was fun (I guess I'm pretty shaky)
Sure was fun (I guess I'm pretty shaky)
It sure was fun, I guess I'm pretty weird
To you, to you
To you, to you

But we're all weird down deep inside
And we're all strange, indeed
Why is it so? The parts we hide
In order to keep our foolish pride
