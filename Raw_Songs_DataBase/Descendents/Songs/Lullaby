Cute little lullaby
It's time for you to come outta there
Cute little lullaby
You know people are just gonna stare

'Cause they know what you've been through
They know everything you do
And they know about your lies
And they know that you've not got
One fucking thing to hide

Cute little lullaby
It's time for you to come outta there
Cute little lullaby
You know people are just gonna stare

'Cause they know that you're a whore
They know what you've got in store
And they know about your lies
And they know that you've not got
One fucking thing to hide
