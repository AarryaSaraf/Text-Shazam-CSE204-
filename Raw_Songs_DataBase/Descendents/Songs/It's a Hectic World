It's a hectic world, making me a nervous wreck
It's a hectic world, wish I had no intellect

It's a rat race
God, what a pace
It's a rat race
It's a disgrace

You gotta keep up with the crowd
If you can't be quiet then I gotta be loud

It's a rat race
It's a rat race
It's a rat race

Hey!
You!

Try to get ahead is what I'm supposed to do
No matter what I do, I gotta get ahead of you

It's a rat race
God, what a pace
It's a rat race
It's a disgrace

You gotta keep up with the crowd
If you can't be quiet then I gotta be loud

It's a rat race
It's a rat race
It's a rat race
