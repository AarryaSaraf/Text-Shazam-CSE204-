When I get the time 
I'd like to sit down and write a little rhyme for you 
Just a couple few 
I'd tell you what you mean to me 
I'd tell you what you mean to me 


When I get the time 
I'd put it all down and pick you up 
I'd say throw it all away 
The world is me and you tonight

Will there come a day with nothing standing in my way? 
Living that dream within your arms 
Well I'll make it happen someday 
I'll make it happen someday 
I'll make it happen 
I'll make it happen someday

When I get the time
I gotta get the time
I get the time

I look in your eyes 
Warm places inside I've never been before 
I gotta find some more 
I know you don't owe me anything 

When I get the time 
When I get the guts 
To live my life for me 
And do what I want to do 

I'd be the friend that you said you once knew 
Will there come a day when we give up and turn away? 
And I'd have nothing left, nothing left except 
I'd have all the time in the world, all the time in the world 

Time to remember 
Look through the window 
And time to cry 
Time to cry 

I gotta get the time 
Where can I find the time?
Get the time
