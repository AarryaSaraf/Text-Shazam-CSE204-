Mirror, mirror please believe 

I need to find a sign 

All of my life's spent wondering 

Whose hiding behind this face of mine 


Confusion, illusion, a misinterpretation 

Of the original me 


I need a sign, a simple chime 

A windblown kiss across my mind 

Solitude in the craziness 

Of a world gone mad, a world behind 


Confusion, illusion, a misinterpretation 

Of the original me 


What big thoughts you have 

I can see them in your eyes 

When you pretend to laugh 

The reflection I see 

Reminds me 

Of somebody like me 


Chance the day and spring a laugh 

Don't stray off the beaten path 

Mental prostitution 

In this universal institution 


Confusion, illusion, a misinterpretation 

Of the original me 

Confession, agression, my time to end the session 

One bang and I'm free 


What big thoughts you have 

I can see them in your eyes 

When you pretend to laugh 

The reflection I see 

Reminds me 

Of somebody like me 


What big thoughts you have 

I can see them in your eyes 

When you pretend to laugh 

The reflection I see 

Reminds me 

Of somebody like me.
