Talking about our life

No matter how much I don't like

Talk is never cheap between you and me

Look at how far we've come

And so we always come undone

Maybe that's how it always has to be


I'm out here alone

Talking on the phone

Tensions are risin' it's never surprising

This is the way it goes

Maybe we'll fall in love when I get home


Talking about our life

Seems like we never get it right

But we always get an A for effort

We're searching for what to say

Communications the only way

If we ever hope to stay together

Communicate


I'm out here alone

Talking on the phone

Tensions are risin' it's never surprising

This is the way it goes

Maybe we'll fall in love when I get home


Tell me the problem

I wanna know

If there's a solution I'll fix it now

And if there isn't I'll just be there

If I don't say something

Don't say I don't care


Well I go yaduh duh duh duh duh

And you go yaduh duh duh duh duh

Yaduh duh duh duh duh ya that's what we gotta do


I'm out here alone

Talking on the phone

Tensions are risin' it's never surprising

This is the way it goes

Maybe we'll fall in love when I get home

Maybe we'll fall in love when I get home

I said maybe we'll fall in love when I get home
