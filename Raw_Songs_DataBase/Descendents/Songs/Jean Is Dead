Wake up early, mad at you.
Go to school, but where are you? 
You should've told me, I should've known,
But now you're gone, and I'm alone.

Your mother told me last night on the phone.
Why'd you do it? Now I'm alone.
I would've helped you, would've done anything.
Taken you with me, or bought you a ring.

Now you're gone, and I'm alone!
Now you're gone, and I'm alone!

You should've told me, I should've known,
But now you're gone, and I'm alone.
