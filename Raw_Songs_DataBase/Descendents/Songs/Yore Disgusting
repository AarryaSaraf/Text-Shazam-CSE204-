Yore disgusting, like the hind of a dog
Yore disgusting, you know you look like a hog
Yore disgusting, you know you always were
Yore disgusting, subhuman, that's for sure

Yore disgusting, you're disguising your face
And you're out of place
Yore disgusting, you're disguising your face
And you're out of place
Yore disgusting, you're disguising your face
And you're out of place

Yore disgusting, no need to hide it
Yore disgusting, take a look you might find it
Yore disgusting, pretty rough and crude
Yore disgusting, and I don't want see you

Yore disgusting, you're disguising your face
And you're out of place
Yore disgusting, you're disguising your face
And you're out of place
Yore disgusting, you're disguising your face
And you're out of place

Yore disgusting, no need to hide it
Yore disgusting, take a look you might find it
Yore disgusting, pretty rough and crude
Yore disgusting, and I don't want see you
