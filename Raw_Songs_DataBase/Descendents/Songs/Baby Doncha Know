The world passes by, but I have not yet realized
We both know it's you that I cannot recognize

So you come up to me, asking me to assist you
But baby doncha know I've already been told
And I'm really through with you
And I really hate you

You're getting older and you always try to look young
But baby doncha know your best has already been done

So you come up to me, asking me to assist you
But baby doncha know I've already been told
And I'm really through with you
And I really hate you

Do you know what you're gonna do with yourself?
I guess not
