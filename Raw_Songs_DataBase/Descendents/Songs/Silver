First fear can I make all day
Silver melts like a glass of ice
Silver born you were led a stray
Memories control his future

And I, and I, won't melt into the ground
This time, I feel shy, won't melt into myself

First time, for everything my sacred view
Don't think on anything, it's all in your head
I still want your lies

A first fear can I make all day
Silver melts like a glass of ice
Silver born you were led a stray
I will reserve this fast
First fear, it felt okay
First time for everything
Your friends were still in my face
Oh I will not turn away

And I, and I, won't melt into the ground
And I, and I, won't melt into myself
And all I need, what I see
I see my dreams collide
And I feel, yeah I feel
I still feel my heart tonight

First time for everything, my sacred view
Don't think on anything it's all in your head
(Or anything) not any more drugs
More silver, silver, silver gone blue

Third week I start a new
Silver me, instead of blue
I feel a shiver on my face
But it's just another cold sweat

And I, and I, won't melt into myself
And I, and I, won't melt into the ground
Well I need, what I see
I see my dreams collide
Well I feel, yeah I feel
I still feel my heart tonight

And I wish I could tell you
I wish I could be with you again
And I wish I could hold you
Well I'll see ya, I'll see
I've lost another friend

Next time when I see the van
Next time I'll feel my love
Give it back my innocence
Give it back my dignity
Throwing out the innocent
Throwing out the human heart
All I fool there is to this
And all my silver begins to glow

And I, and I, won't melt into the ground
And I, and I, won't melt into myself
Well I need, what I see
I see my dreams collide
Well I feel, yeah I feel
I still feel my heart tonight

First year, can I let it bleed

Don't think on anything, its all in your head
The words you like
Are silver, silver, silver, silver, silver
