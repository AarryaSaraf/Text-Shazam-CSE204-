I can't believe what you just said
You'd sell your soul for a dollar bill
I can see the signs in your eyes
The signs that make an honest man lie

You've got green on your mind
Now you've got green in your eyes
Say green is sex, green is power
Such filthy thoughts
I think you better go take a shower

You're seeing green
I'm seeing red

I can't believe what you just said
I heard your song, then I heard your spiel
Music as money has gone to your head
You're seeing green, I'm seeing red

You've got green on your mind
Now you've got green in your eyes
Say green is sex, green is power
Such filthy thoughts
I think you better go take a shower

You're seeing green
I'm seeing red

I used to listen and we'd share your love
It didn't matter that I had none to give
But now I want to steal your heart
Claim it as mine before the bidding starts
I've got green on my face
Got jealous green I can taste
Bitter-green bile because you're vile
And yet I covet what I hate

You're seeing green
I'm seeing red
