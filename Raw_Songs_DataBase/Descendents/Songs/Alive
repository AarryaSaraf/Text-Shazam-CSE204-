I know I don't control you. 
I know I don't own you, 
But I still feel a sense of pride
'Cause I know what we have is alive. 

It's alive, and it always used to frighten me. 
Now, I know it'll always be a part of me. 
It's alive. 

I know sometimes we're strangers. 
I know there's still some danger,
But I still feel a sense of pride
'Cause I know what we have is alive. 

It's alive, and it always used to frighten me. 
Now, I know it'll always be a part of me. 
It's alive. 

Alive, more than survive, 
More than get by, 
More than our lives. 
It's alive.

I know we'll be together. 
I know -- forever. 
Baby, look into my eyes, 
And you'll know what we have is alive, alive alive. 

It's alive, and it always used to frighten me.
Now, I know it'll always be a part of me. 
Yeah, it's alive, and it always used to frighten me. 
Now, I know it'll always be a part of me. 

It's alive. 
It's alive. 
It's alive.
