They gave you a limiter
Are you limited for life?
I'm so sorry, son
Society don't want to see you 
Go for all

Back then, everybody knew a spaz or two
We never thought those kids were bad, did you?
These days, everybody's found another way
Just give 'em a pill and send 'em on their way

But whatever happened to drug-free youth?
What's to become of our sons, what can we do?

Cause they gave you a limiter
Are you limited for life?
I'm so sorry, son
Society don't want to see you 
Go for all
Limiter, limiter
Are you limited for life?
Society don't want to see

They drug you for this, and then they drug you for that
'Til you don't even know where your head is at
School's the pusher - we don't even have a choice
So what is the future of the limited boys?

Shame on all of us if they're hooked for good
I'd fix you by myself, if I only could

They gave you a limiter
Are you limited for life?
I'm so sorry, son
Society don't want to see you 
Go for all
I'm so sorry, son
I'm so sorry, son
Society don't want to see
