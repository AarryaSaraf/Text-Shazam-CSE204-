This place sucks. 

I haven't found a single thing to call my own,
And there's nothin' left for me to do. 
Just play the game, pretend to do work. 
No, my boss isn't a jerk; it's just this place. 

This place sucks. 

I've been slinkin' through the halls like an unwashed dog,
And everybody treats me like a criminal,
Talk about me behind my back. 
At least I don't have a stick up my ass like the people in this place. 

This place sucks.
This place sucks. 
This place sucks. 

I feel my confidence draining away. 
I feel them laughing at me everyday. 
I never thought it would end up this way. 
Good thing I'm not gonna stay. 

This place sucks. 

I haven't found a single friend in three whole years 
'Cause there's nobody here but the Bible boys,
Talkin' 'bout their white bread politics. 
Gotta leave the room 'cause you're makin' me sick; gotta leave this place.

This place sucks.
