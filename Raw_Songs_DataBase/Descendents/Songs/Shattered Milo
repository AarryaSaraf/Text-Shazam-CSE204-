I looked in her eyes but I can see 

My place in her's a mystery 

Struggle, as I try to say 

The words I know she won't believe 

Growing tired, of this game 

I must know, what she wants from me 

Oh and what, does she say 


Well I'm beginning to wonder 

I'm beginning to doubt 

What kind a spell are you under 

I can't figure you out 


Keep your eyes away from me, 

Leave alone that's what I need 

Now don't touch me 

Don't look me in the eye 

Stay at least a foot away 

The more I want, the more I sweat 

The more I blow everything I say 

You may think I'm bitching now 

But you'll find out who I really am some day 


Why don't you give me a sign 

Walk with me, smile, just let me know 

Do you like my act? 

And am I putting on a good show 


Cause that's all you'll get from me 

What am I like? 

Even I don't know 

They call me a fucking Milo 


Well I don't see the attraction 

Your not telling the truth 

I don't give satisfaction 

And I won't play those games with you

I think you're getting to close to me 

Leave alone that's what I need 


My mind, is my saving grace 

My cage, my hiding place, 

My mind, helps me chose the fate 

Today a man felt self disgrace 

My mind, I wish it could erase 

I've erased 


Everything but your face 

Leave your face 

Oh not a trace 

Except your face 

Your face 

Your face
