You make me sick with your pretty face
Can't stand you stinkin' up the whole place
Don't want to see you out on the street
I hope we never meet

'Cause you make me sick
You make me sick
You make me sick

You're in the magazines, you're on TV
If there's money, then that's where you'll be
Don't be nice to me, don't even try
I hate your guts, and I'll tell you why

'Cause you make me sick
You make me sick
Yeah, you make me sick
