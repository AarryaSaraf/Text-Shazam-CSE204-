About three years ago, you know
They said rock and roll was too slow, so it's gotta go
Then a couple of blokes said they don't wanna toke
And they made some noise on their electric toys
They had a lot of fun, the world was stunned
They said, "New wave, man"
And that's when punk began

Last of the Mohicans
Last of the Mohicans
Last of the Mohicans
Last of the Mohicans

And if you cut your hair a certain way
Then you're in the game, and you're gonna play
Playing

Last of the Mohicans
Last of the Mohicans
Last of the Mohicans
Last of the Mohicans
