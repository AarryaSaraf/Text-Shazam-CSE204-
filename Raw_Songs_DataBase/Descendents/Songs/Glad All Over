You say you love me all of the time
You say you need me, you'll always be mine

I'm feelin' glad all over, yes I'm-a glad all over
Baby, I'm glad all over, so glad you're mine

I'll make you happy, you'll never be blue
You'll have no sorrow, 'cause I'll always be true

And I'm feelin' glad all over, yes I'm-a glad all over
Baby, I'm glad all over, so glad you're mine

Other girls may try to take me away
But you know, it's by your side I will stay
I-I will stay

Our love will last now till the end of time
Because this love now is gonna be yours and mine

I'm feelin' glad all over, yes I'm-a glad all over
Baby, I'm glad all over, so glad you're mine, yeah

Glad all over
Glad all over
Glad all over
Glad all over
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey-hey-hey
