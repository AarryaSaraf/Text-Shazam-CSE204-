I'm lonely today
Won't you come out to play
When I'm with you all the world goes away
Your smile and your eyes
They keep me alive
Your voice is a bell that massages my mind

And it makes me wonder
And it makes me sad
And it makes me nervous
And it makes me oh, so mad

Because I think about you every night and day
And when I could have asked I let it slip away
I've got to get to know you, but I'm so afraid
Well it's so hard to be a friend and be in love this way
Be in love this way
Be in love this way

Oh, talk to me please
You've brought me to my knees
Only your words melt my twenty year freeze
I've known you so long
I've known all along
But suddenly my thoughts of you are so strong

And it makes me wonder
And it makes me sad
And it makes me nervous
And it makes me oh, so mad

Because I wonder if I'm more than just a friend
Did I really see a fire or just inside my head
Sometimes I know you just want me to go away
Well it's so hard to be a friend and be in love this way
Be in love this way
Be in love this way

Karen, may I
See your blue eyes
Karen, may I
Tell you tonight
That it makes me wonder
