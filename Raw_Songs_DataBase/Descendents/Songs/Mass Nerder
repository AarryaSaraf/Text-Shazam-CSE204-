Don't got no goatee
Don't got no tattoo
Don't got no nose ring
Don't wanna be like you

See I got these glasses
So I'll never be cool
Always get my ass kick
When I get to school

Don't worry about image
Don't got no attitude
I know I won't get laid
If I wont be like you!

Don't got no biceps
Don't got no pecks
But I'll read you under the table
With my thick specks

See I got these glasses
So they kick my ass
But I'll kick their asses
When I get to class

I got these glasses
So I can't wear shades
I'll kick their asses
I'll get good grades

Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna get good grades!

I can't get rid of the times
Can't stop the party line
Don't know what the scenes about
Don't tell me to mellow out!

Don't got no goatee
No fucking safety pin
No I ain't no junkie
Don't got no heroin

Don't got no styling lotion
Don't wanna live by the ocean
Just wanna be myself
All you posers go to hell!

Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna get good grades!

Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna kick their asses in class
Gonna get good grades!

Asses in class
Asses in class
Asses in class

Asses in class
Asses in class
Asses in class

We must read
We must read
We must read
We must read
We must read
RRRREEEEAAAADDDD!

Somebody get me a book!
