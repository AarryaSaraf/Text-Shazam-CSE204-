I'm the one; I've been here for you all along.
I'm the one whose shoulder you've been cryin' on.

Nice guys finish last-no one knows as good as me.
We're just good friends, and you come to me for sympathy.

You tell me that I'm not your type,
But still you call me late at night
Every time he picks a fight.
After all he's said and all he's done-

I'm the one; I've been here for you all along.
I'm the one whose shoulder you've been cryin' on.

He's a total dick; that's the truth, and you know I'm right.
From everything you say, there's no way he'll ever do you right.

You love a man who treats you wrong.
You think you'll change him, but you're wrong.
He'll use you; then, he'll say, "So long."
After all he's said and all he's done-

I'm the one; I've been here for you all along.
I'm the one whose shoulder you've been cryin' on.

I'm the one who wants you more than anything;
You don't feel the same way-you've made it clear to me,
But I'll stand my ground and maybe
You'll hear what I've been sayin'.

After all I've said and all I've done-

I'm the one; I've been here for you all along.
I'm the one whose shoulder you've been cryin' on.
I'm the one; I've been here for you all along.
I'm the one whose shoulder you've been cryin' on.

I'm the one.
