Judgement time again, who's on the shit list this time around
Whose friends can we pick and tell them how to live
Value judgement hide, it's a-comin' our way
He's just a jerk himself, tryin' to earn his own
He goes to the bar to get his girl
But the rich he's got ain't what it's worth
Says he needs his little sexual push
Says two in the hand's worth one in the bush
Because he's just a pain in the ass
He's a thorn in my side
Why can't he leave me alone?
Instead of running my life?
