I'm not a punk; how can I be?
Show me the way to conformity.
Try to be different, but it's always the same.
End up playin' someone else's game.

I'm just a square goin' nowhere. 
I'm just a square goin' nowhere.

You used to walk by my side.
Now you see me comin', now you hide.
I see you here, I see you there.
I can see that you don't care. 

I'm just a square goin' nowhere. 
I'm just a square goin' nowhere.

I'm just a square goin' nowhere.
Square goin' nowhere.
I'm just a square goin' nowhere.
Square goin' nowhere.
