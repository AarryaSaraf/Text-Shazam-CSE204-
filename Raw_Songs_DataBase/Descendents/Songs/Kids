Warning the Basemaster General has determined that coffee is good for your health 

Doug is bouncing off the walls 
Ray is drooling big spit balls 
Feeling cranky, logged all night 

Kids on coffee 

Where's my Bonus Cup? 
Come on man, fill me up 
I need some Krappers to wash it down 

Kids on coffee 

Kids on coffee 

Went driving down to San Diego 
Passing by the nuclear tits 
Go away off my earth! 

Kids on coffee! 

Thanks to modern chemistry, sleeping is now optional.
