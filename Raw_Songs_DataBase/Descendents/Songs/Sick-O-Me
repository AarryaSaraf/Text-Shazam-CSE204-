New love, new fun, new me

Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?

New fear, nothing's clear to me

And that's how it's always gonna be

I've never been real sure of myself

Never trusted someone else

Something you do puts my fears to rest


We'll bring it up and never touch the ground

And when you need me I'll be around

This is how it's gonna be

If you don't get Sick-O-Me


She loved me and I loved her

It was all so fun and new

We were going to go all over the world

And do everything there is to do

But something spoiled our plans

We couldn't meet our own demands

Every problem put us to the test


We brought it up but then we let it down

And when she needed me I wasn't around

That was how it had to be

Then she just got Sick-O-Me


Relationships deteriorate

I've seen it from the start

Easy as it is to fall in love

It's easier to fall apart

I won't let it fall apart


Bring it up and never touch the ground

And when you need me I'll be around

This is how it's gonna be

If you don't get Sick-O-Me


We'll hold it up and never let it down

And when you need me I'll be around

This is how it's gotta be

So you don't get Sick-O-Me

So you don't get Sick-O-Me

So you don't get Sick-O-Me
