When I walk down the street people can't resist to stare 
I don't exist and I'm not really there 
Tired and sick I wanna get outta here 
'Cause the people round here don't like the way I know 

They don't like the way I know 

Like the way I know
Like the way I know
Like the way I know
Like the way I know
Like the way I know

Getting scared I wanna get outta here 
'Cause people round here don't like the way I know 

They don't like the way I know 

Like the way I know
Like the way I know
Like the way I know
Like the way I know
Like the way I know
Like the way I know
