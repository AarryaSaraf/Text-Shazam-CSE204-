I don't believe in unity

it's just one more abandoned dream

once the people get together it's easy to see

it's just a matter of time til they come after me


but it must be pretty cool to be you

with your brothers at your back, protecting you

it must be pretty cool to know you belong

isolated my whole life counting scars in the land of the smiling knives

yes I'm envious it's true, but it must be cool to be you


you got a loving family to give you everything you need

my family loves each other so much

we live a thousand miles away and never stay in touch


but it must be pretty cool to be you

with a home and a family to go home to

must be pretty cool to know you belong

isolated my whole life counting scars in the land of the smiling knives

yes I'm envious it's true but it must be cool to be you


what can I do? I know this bitter jealousy is wrong

maybe i'll move, and find a brand new place I don't belong

some friends I'll never know (I'll never know) 

New places I can't go (I can't go)

Cause everywhere I've been

Is on the outside lookin in...


You got a deep sustaining faith,

a lord who listens when you pray

I was raised in a church and I was taught to believe

I wonder if god believes in me...


It must be pretty cool to be you

with your holy faith sustaining you

must be pretty cool to know you belong

isolated my whole life counting scars in the land of the smiling knives

yes I'm envious it's true but it must be cool to be you


Must be cool to be you


Must be cool...................
