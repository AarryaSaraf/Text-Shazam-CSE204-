Come on baby

We gotta get our clothes on

There'll be no easy days

Cause I got no degree


You'll see your brother in a week or three

Here's a picture of me 

Just don't let them see

Cause they're not that fond of me

They're gonna tell you that I'm not real

But their time is through

And I'll be the one

Ya I'll see this through


I'll fight for you

No one else is going to 

They're to busy fighting over you


Come on baby

We gotta get our plane now

Punk rock won't pay the bills

So we gotta get started early

I like to hang around here with you

Gotta life to teach you

Just you and me


Their gonna tell you that I'm not real

But their time is through

And I'm with you still

And I'll be the one (I'll be the one)

Ya I'll see this through 


I'll fight for you

No one else is going to 

Their to busy fighting over you


Their gonna tell you that I'm not real

But we're having fun together everyday

What could be more real than that?

To a girl who and her dad

And there is no way for they to brainwash you away from me


Come on baby

I gotta try to explain things

There's no easy way to say these things to you

There's no easy way to tell you what is real

So come on baby let's just go home now

I'll be responsible

I'll do everything I have to 


Ya I'll be the one

I'll be invincible

I'll see it through

I'll be invincible

I'll fight for you

I'll fight for you

We'll be okay
