Gotta clean, gotta shine
Gotta weep, gotta whine
Got a good piece of ass
Down on Sunset and Vine
You gotta come on me, bitch
And stop all this fuckin' around
And you gotta somehow please stop
Before you let go and become loose
Like how you are from my hand
And I just hope you're real good
'Cause you gotta take care
Don't you ever dare fare
And take good care, a real good air
And lay 'em bare there without a stare
A stare from anywhere 'cause it's my hair
It's my hair, it's my hair
And I'll do what I want

Gotta clean, gotta shine
Gotta weep, gotta whine
Got a good piece of ass
Down on Sunset and Vine
You gotta come on me, bitch
And stop all this fuckin' around
And you gotta somehow please stop
Before you let go and become loose
Like how you are from my hand
And I just hope you're real good
'Cause you gotta take care
Don't you ever dare fare
And take good care, a real good air
And lay 'em bare there without a stare
A stare from anywhere 'cause it's my hair
It's my hair, it's my hair
And I'll do what I want
