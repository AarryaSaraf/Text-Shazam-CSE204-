Stay away from the chili verde

Unless you want to get blown away

Treat the spider with a little respect

You take the heat - it's gonna bite back


Blast off at Cape Canaveral

Toilet seat is your launching pad

Blast off at Cape Canaveral

4, 3, 2, 1, Blast off!


Capsaicinoids are a thing to avoid

Unless you wanna burn in that 'roid

We'll be laughing and rolling on the floor

When we hear you screaming through that door


Blast off at Cape Canaveral

All systems go!

Blast off at Cape Canaveral

4, 3, 2, 1, Blast off!


Shhhh, shh shh you can hear him! You can hear...

No, no, listen! You can hear him


Jalepeno, Habenero

Burning all yo' hair down there-o

Picinu, Vindaloo

They're gonna getcha

They're gonna getcha too!


You know those red things in the Kung Pao?

Don't say I didn't warn you now

Take the time to pick them out

Or the spider gets grouchy

And it's time to countdown!


Blast off at Cape Canaveral

Ohh ohhh ohhh

Blast off at Cape Canaveral

WOOOOO HOOOO!

Blast off at Cape Canaveral

Houston, we have a problem

Blast off at Cape Canaveral

Now 4, 3, 2, 1, Blast off!
