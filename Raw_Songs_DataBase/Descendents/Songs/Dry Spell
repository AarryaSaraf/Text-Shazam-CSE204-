If it was for me,

I thought it would come so easy.

Never realized, lifes just a series of lows and highs.

I just want to create, it doesnt matter how i do it.

Nobody ever said thats theres nothing to it.


Goosebumps been gone, for way to long.


Couldnt get it for free, couldnt do it for the money.

It just disapeared, spent alot of bearin years.

and if it doesnt work out, you can just set it down for later.

Nobody ever said you'd be dead forever.

Who knows how long, they'll stick around.
