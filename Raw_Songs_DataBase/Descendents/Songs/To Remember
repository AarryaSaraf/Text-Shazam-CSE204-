Stumbled in last night
My head was still throbbing
Then I remembered

Ah, the things I said to you
I didn't mean it
I didn't want to say it
So I ask your forgiveness
Just give me one kiss

To remember
The way we were
To remember
The things I said
To remember
To remember you

Oh, I want you to know
That I feel for you
And I want you to know
That I walk with you
And I want you to see

To remember
The way we were
To remember
The things I said
To remember
To remember you
