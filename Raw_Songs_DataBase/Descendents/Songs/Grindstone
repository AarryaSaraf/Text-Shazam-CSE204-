You took the bait, bought the whole rotten ticket
I know you're feeling betrayed
Life showed you how and where you could stick it
Maybe your trust was mislaid
Grindstone grinding
It's really wearing you down
Shoveling dung in the daily world circus
As "Chumpy," the everyday no class clown
 
They stick you up to shake you down
They set you up to take you down
 
Too late for a new bad decision
The fix is already in
Just keep shooting, you'll hit what you're missing
But come up empty again
Anger rises
And it's an impotent rage
Sing chapter and verse of your obsolete anthem
While time and the grindstone wear you away
 
It beats you up, and wears you down
It sets you up to tear you down
