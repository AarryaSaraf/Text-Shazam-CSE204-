She loves me; it's not just in my head. 
She loves me even though it's not been said, 
And if anything means anything, then this means something good.
I guess I'd love her back if I only could. 

She loves me; I can see it when she smiles ear-to-ear. 
She loves me, and I'm sure that she can't hear 
How I scream out for someone else 
When I'm asleep or by myself,
How I'm so sad, I hate myself. 
I don't know where to go for help! 

Her love could never grow sour. 
It grows more pure with every hour. 
I never wanted anything like that from her. 

But still, she loves me; it's not just in my head. 
She loves me even though it's not been said, 
And if anything means anything, then this means something good.
I guess I'd love her back if I only could. 

She loves me, and I know she can accept me for myself. 
She loves me, but I'm sure that she can't help 
How I'm this close to cashing in, 
How I chase dreams that don't exist, 
How I hate girls and I hate my life, 
The pain-it rips me, tears me, ruins me! 

Her love could never grow sour. 
It grows more pure with every hour. 
I never wanted anything like that from her. 

But still, she loves me. 
(I don't have to be)
She loves me. 
(All by myself) 
She loves me. 
(She don't love no one else)
She loves me. 

The way she loves me. 
The way she loves me.
