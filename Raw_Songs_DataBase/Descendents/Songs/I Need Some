There will never be another one just like her
Nobody comes close, and that's for sure
I need someone to see me through
Not just anybody, I need you

'Cause I need someone about your age
Other girls, they wanna play games
Gimme a kiss girl, 'cause that's what I need
Gimme some lovin'

A girl that won't hesitate, yeah

See that girl, she's so fine
Take a good stare, she's gonna be mine
A little bit close, a little bit snug
She's the woman I want to hug

'Cause I need someone, I need someone
I need someone, I really need some
I need someone, I need someone
I need someone

A girl that won't hesitate, yeah
