Revolution is only for the young
A bunch of 50 year olds can't change the world

But that's not true and we got
Unfinished business
Show our kids to think for themselves

Politics is only for the shrewd
The fry cook at Denny's can't change the world

But that's not true and we got
Unfinished business
And a ton of good will to leave behind

How we treat each other
How we treat ourselves
And the world

Humanity, ill intended from the start
We'd better just hide behind the TV

But that's not true and we got
Unfinished business
A precedent of virtue to be established

I'm not just gonna slink down in this rocking chair and fall asleep
