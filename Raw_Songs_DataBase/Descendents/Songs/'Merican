We flipped our finger to the king of England
Stole our country from the indians
With god on our side and guns in our hands
We took it for our own
A nation dedicated to liberty
Justice and equality
Does it look that way to you? It doesn't look that way to me
The sickest joke I know

Listen up man, I'll tell you who I am
Just another stupid American
You don't wanna listen, you don't wanna understand
So finish up your drink and go home

I come from the land of Ben Franklin
Twain and Poe and Walt Whitman
Otis Redding, Ellington
The country that I love
But it's a land of the slaves and the ku klux klan
Haymarket riot and the great depression
Joe McCarthy, Vietnam
The sickest joke I know

Listen up man, I'll tell you who I am
Just another stupid American
You don't wanna listen, you don't wanna understand
So finish up your drink and go home

I'm proud and ashamed
Every fourth of July
You got to know the truth
Before you say that you got pride

Now the cops got tanks 'cause the kids got guns
Shrinks pushing pills on everyone
Cancer from the ocean, cancer from the sun
Straight to Hell we go

Listen up man, I'll tell you who I am
Just another stupid American
You don't wanna listen, you don't wanna understand
So finish up your drink and go home
Listen up man, I'll tell you who I am
Just another stupid American
You don't wanna listen, you don't wanna understand
So finish up your drink and go home
Finish up your drink and go home
