Here in my van I can beat my small cock
Fart on your face, sleep on a loaf
Here in my van I can piss in a cup
Do what I want, scrounge for some change
I can lose

Here in my van I can eat my small squid
Dance the can-can with my feet in the air
Here in my van I can play the last tape
Play my small uke, write stupid songs
Like this one...
Yeah, yeah like this one

Haven't slept in days but that's okay
Gonna let 'er eat
Cat pizza road apples coffee shun Vivarin
Have a little snack
Put in a quarter and play road rally
Driving down the dark corridor
Fall asleep and wake up in another place

Here in my van I can beat my small cock
Fart on your face, sleep on a loaf
Here in my van I can piss in a cup
Scrounge for some change, do what I want
I can lose

Here in my van I can hate everyone
Wait for no girls to call me in the middle of the night
Here in my van I can lose my small mind
