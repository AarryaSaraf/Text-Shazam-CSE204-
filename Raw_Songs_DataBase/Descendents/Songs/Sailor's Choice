Red, white, black and yellow, I just yellow
I just yellow, I just yellow

I'm degenerate, I just yellow
I'm no hippie, no, no, I just yellow

Nothing you can do and nothing you can say
Is gonna make me change my way

'Cause I just yellow, I just yellow
I just yellow, I just yellow

I just yellow on the phone
I just yellow and don't get stoned
No, I just yellow, I just yellow
