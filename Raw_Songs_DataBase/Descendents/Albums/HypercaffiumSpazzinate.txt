Album: HypercaffiumSpazzinate

// Feel This //

Busted heart, my brain is beat, yeah
Don't want a doctor
Need zero anesthetic to make me numb
Escape is easy and everybody's offering

I wanna feel this
Gotta have to bear witness
Gonna take pain straight the way I found it
I gotta feel this
So I can kick this sickness
The only way to get my mind around it

Busted brain, my heart is beat, yeah
Don't want a bottle
Or well-intended smiles and lies
Escape is easy and everybody's offering

I wanna feel this
Gotta have to bear witness
Gonna take pain straight the way I found it
I gotta feel this
So I can kick this sickness
Wanna take pain straight the way I found it
Can't get around it
Can't heal without it

// Victim Of Me //

I just quit this joke of a life plan
It won't get me nowhere, no
I'm a fear driven service robot
A spectacle of a man with no options

No further will I travel 
Aimlessly
Along this fool's errand
No longer be 
A victim of me

Complain about everything in my life
And blame everybody I know
I make every decision laced in panic
Regrettable, but I know it's amendable

No further will I travel 
Aimlessly
Along this fool's errand
No longer be 
A victim of me

I don't have to run from me
Just turn away
And be satisfied
And I'm not going to fight with me
Just turn away
And stop wandering aimlessly

Yeah I'm not going to choose to be
A victim of me
I'm not going to let myself be
A victim of me

// On Paper //

I'm not so easy on the eye
It's been said my face can make an onion cry
I mean no harm, but I've got the charm
Of a murdering serial raper
I never get none, and I know why
But there's more to me than meets the eye
The real live me ain't certified
But I look good on paper

Statistically I'm far above the rest
I do my homework, never have to guess
My social life's an empty wreck
Romance is an alien labor
There are things about me you'll never know
Unless you scratch the surface and look below
My resume is solid gold
I look good on paper

I got straight A's on every test
A perfect credit score
My ledgers never in the red
I look good on paper

I never get none, and I know why
But there's more to me than meets the eye
If you got the time I'm qualified
I look good on paper
I look good on paper
I look good 
On paper
On paper

// Shameless Halo //

Shameless halo
I think you forgot love along the way
Shameless halo
Where does your heart go when you pray?

I know what your prophet meant
But every time you vent
Sweet honey turns to poison
Sweet honey turns to poison

Shameless halo
You believe in heaven, why are you so afraid?
Shameless halo
There's a victim card that you play
When you don't get your way
You judge other peoples choices
You'd silence different voices

Shameless Halo
Where does your heart go when you pray?
You call it the book of love
You're swinging it like a club
Sweet honey turns to poison
I watch what you say and do
I can't stand the tone of your tune
Sweet honey turns to poison
Sweet honey turns to poison

// No Fat Burger //

Can't have no more juicy burgers
Can't have no more greasy fries
Doctor took my lipid profile
He told me I'm barely alive

No more fat
No more fat
No more chicken pot pies, no more chorizo
I can't have that

Got this problem from my father
Grandpa died at 45
Heart attack and a triple bypass
Future's looking very bright

No more fat
No more fat
No more apple fritters, no more ice cream
I can't have that
No more fat
No more fat
I like food, but all the food that tastes good…
I can't have that

// Testosterone //

Need it bad, someone gimme a dose
Need it bad, testosterone
I'm not God… I wanna be one
[x2]

Good things don't come to those who wait
They only come to those who take
I waited so long to have my chance
They told me I didn't have what it takes
So slam it right here in my vein

Need it bad, someone gimme a dose
Need it bad, testosterone
I'm not God… I wanna be one

So gimme more – no, gimme all of those
I want the lion's share… I know
I'm not God… I just wanna be one, yeah

And all you fuckin' dicks who beat your chest
Don't even think that I'm impressed
But they're trying to take my wife,
My life, my job, so…
Right now I need something for my brain
Right now I need to go insane
Insane

Need it now

// Without Love //

Long years waiting for it
Lost pages given to disease within me
Long days fighting for it
Lost years left praying for relief from sickness
Then madness
 
Life won't wait for us
And love won't heal itself
Let's find our way
 
Another day goes by
We can't live like this anymore
Can't live without love
Another year goes by
We can't live like this anymore
Can't live without love
 
Shock faded, no one passed away
We live to fight a million days… in silence
Dark pages no one has to see
Lock every door around us in self-defense
We conceal this
 
Life won't wait for us
And love won't heal itself
Let's find our way
 
Another day goes by
We can't live like this anymore
Can't live without love
A life just passing by
We can't live like this anymore
Can't live without love
 
We let it down… gave in to infatuation
We tore it down by giving way to blind temptation
But I know there's a reason
We've gotta believe it's true
And find our way
 
Another day goes by
We can't live like this anymore
Can't live without love
Our final chance to try
We can't live like this anymore
Can't live without love

Can't live without love
Can't live without love

// We Got Defeat //

Yeah the world just kicked my ass again
Old news, it's the same way it's ever been

Just like before
Sprawling senseless
To the floor
With no defenses

Don't have the time to be angry
I'll use my mind, find out how they beat me

Not like before
I'll learn some new tricks
I'm gonna school
The sonsabitches

We got defeat, but I'm learning
We got defeat - I'm determined
We got defeat - I'll return and
I'll beat 'em next time

Winning never taught anybody anything
Underdogs get the bone eventually

Not like before
I think I got this
I'm gonna school
The sonsabitches

We got defeat, but I'm learning
We got defeat - I'm determined
We got defeat - I'll return and
I'll beat 'em next time

// Smile //

I can see your pain has left you locked up, beat down
I can see the fear has made you desperate, burnt out

Too much regret and shattered hope
Sent you slipping down that slope
All I can do is lend a hand
Be a friend again
And it's ok if you want to vent, but…

What I wouldn't give to see you smile
Once in a while
What I wouldn't give to see you smile
Once in a while

I can feel the bitterness that drains you, poisons you
And all those grass-is-greener thoughts, I'm telling you, they're killing you

You're not a have-not, can't you see
What you've got's so important to me
Measuring your life versus theirs
You'll always come out ahead
In all the ways that really matter, so…

What I wouldn't give to see you smile
Once in a while
What I wouldn't give to see you smile
Oh what I wouldn't, wouldn't
What I wouldn't give to see you smile
Once in a while
What I wouldn't give to see you smile
Once in a while

I can see your pain has left you locked up, beat down, desperate, burnt out
I'm telling you, it's killing you, killing you, killing you

I can see your pain
There's nothing I can say except

Toil away, and at the end of the day
You can look back on a game well played
Toil away, and at the end of the day
You can look back on a game well played
Toil away, and at the end of the day
You can look back on a game well played
Toil away, and at the end of the day
You can look back on a game well played

// Limiter //

They gave you a limiter
Are you limited for life?
I'm so sorry, son
Society don't want to see you 
Go for all

Back then, everybody knew a spaz or two
We never thought those kids were bad, did you?
These days, everybody's found another way
Just give 'em a pill and send 'em on their way

But whatever happened to drug-free youth?
What's to become of our sons, what can we do?

Cause they gave you a limiter
Are you limited for life?
I'm so sorry, son
Society don't want to see you 
Go for all
Limiter, limiter
Are you limited for life?
Society don't want to see

They drug you for this, and then they drug you for that
'Til you don't even know where your head is at
School's the pusher - we don't even have a choice
So what is the future of the limited boys?

Shame on all of us if they're hooked for good
I'd fix you by myself, if I only could

They gave you a limiter
Are you limited for life?
I'm so sorry, son
Society don't want to see you 
Go for all
I'm so sorry, son
I'm so sorry, son
Society don't want to see

// Fighting Myself //

On the run since before ever after
Standard family disaster
Lovers, brothers, other bastards
Told me where to go
I shook my lumps, then took off running
Short on wisdom, wits, or cunning
One for all, but all for nothing
Into the unknown

There's no point to waste the blame
I've never been strictly speaking sane
I should have known fresh dirt won't wash old stains away

I tried to drown your memory
It learned to swim and clung to me
Kissed my cheek sadistically
And dragged me down below

There's no point to waste the blame
I've never been strictly speaking sane
I should have known fresh dirt won't wash old stains away

I was so angry then, in psychic self-defense
Wasting energy, fighting something I couldn't see…
Just fightin' myself

I know time unfolds and then it tangles
Strings attached and feelings mangled
Some threads are severed, some still dangle
Some just drift away

There's no point to waste the blame
I've never been strictly speaking sane
I should have known fresh dirt won't wash old stains away

The last thing I tried to do was end up hurting you
I found my enemy staring back from the mirror at me
I've been fightin' myself
Fightin' myself

There's nobody in the ring but me
I broke some things I know just can't be fixed
While I fought for what I wanted more than anything
You stuck around for kicks
