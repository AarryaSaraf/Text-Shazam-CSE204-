Album: Fat

// My Dad Sucks //

Judgement time again, who's on the shit list this time around
Whose friends can we pick and tell them how to live
Value judgement hide, it's a-comin' our way
He's just a jerk himself, tryin' to earn his own
He goes to the bar to get his girl
But the rich he's got ain't what it's worth
Says he needs his little sexual push
Says two in the hand's worth one in the bush
Because he's just a pain in the ass
He's a thorn in my side
Why can't he leave me alone?
Instead of running my life?

// Mr. Bass //

Mr. Bass lies waiting in his kelpy room
Waiting, til comes doom
He comes and then he goes
He sees Orca and then he knows

I can see mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can feel mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can taste mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can smell mr. Bass tomorrow

We finished the island with a broken motor
We went knocking on the bass' door
They were biting at alarming rate
Mr. Bass, he was irate

I can see mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can feel mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can taste mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can smell mr. Bass tomorrow

Mr. Bass takes a beating
Billy Boy must keep eating
Old Pat, he must be burning
Looks like his stomach's turning
He feeds on the centipedes

He lies behind in a greenish hue
He'll eat whatever, he'll even eat you
Mr. Bass, he knows my hook
'Cause I've been reading them bassin' books

I can see mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can taste mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can feel mr. Bass, he's on my wall
And I can smell mr. Bass tomorrow

Mr. Bass takes a beating
Billy Boy must keep eating
Old Pat, he must be burning
Looks like his stomach's turning
He feeds on the centipedes

Mr. Bass takes a beating
Billy Boy must keep eating
Old Pat, he must be burning
Looks like his stomach's turning
He feeds on the centipedes

// I Like Food //

I like food, food tastes good! 
I like food, food tastes good! 
Juicy burgers, greasy fries, 
Turkey legs and raw fish eyes 
Teenage girls, with ketchup too! 
Get out of my way, or I'll eat you 
I like food, food tastes good! 
I like food, food tastes good! 
I'm going to turn dining back into eating 
I like food, food tastes good! 
I like food, food tastes good!

// Hey Hey //

Hey hey, what do you say?
About our state of affairs
Hey hey, what do you know?
Are you ready to go?

Go, go, go-go
If you think that everything's okay
Then go on home and lock your brain away

Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Ready!

Hey hey, what do you say?
About our state of affairs
Hey hey, what are we for?
Are you ready for war?

Fight, fight, fight-fight
Now's the time to defend your worthless life
Are you going to kill, or be killed?

Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Ready to die?

Large doctor pepper super deluxe,

// Global Probing //

It takes a long time to get what you want
No matter how hard you try, it just won't come
But you keep on tryin', and you don't give up
And it's really silly, and it's all in vain
And if you don't stop you're going to go insane

Cause it takes a long time to get what you want
No matter how hard you try, it just won't come
But you keep on tryin', and you don't give up
And it's really silly, and it's all in vain
And you could be doing other things,
You could be doing what you want

But you keep on tryin' and you don't give up
And it's really silly and it's all in vain
And if you don't stop you're going to go insane
It's all in vain, and if you don't stop you're going to go insane
It's all in vain, and if you don't stop you're going to go insane
Insane! Insane! Insane! Insane!
It's all in vain, and if you don't stop you're going to go insane
