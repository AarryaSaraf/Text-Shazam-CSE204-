// Time Has Told Me //

Time has told me
You're a rare rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind

And time has told me
Not to ask for more
Someday our ocean
Will find its shore

So I'll leave the ways that are making me be
What I really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making me love
What I really don't want to love

Time has told me
You came with the dawn
A soul with no footprint
A rose with no thorn

Your tears they tell me
There's really no way
Of ending your troubles
With things you can say

And time will tell you
To stay by my side
To keep on trying
'til there's no more to hide

So leave the ways that are making you be
What you really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making you love
What you really don't want to love

Time has told me
You're a rare rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind

And time has told me
Not to ask for more
For some day our ocean
Will find its shore

// 'Cello Song //

Strange face, with your eyes
So pale and sincere.
Underneath you know well
You have nothing to fear.
For the dreams that came to you when so young
Told of a life
Where spring is sprung.

You would seem so frail
In the cold of the night
When the armies of emotion
Go out to fight.
But while the earth sinks to its grave
You sail to the sky
On the crest of a wave.

So forget this cruel world
Where I belong
I'll just sit and wait
And sing my song.
And if one day you should see me in the crowd
Lend a hand and lift me
To your place in the cloud.

// The Thoughts Of Mary Jane //

Who can know
The thoughts of Mary jane
Why she flies
Or goes out in the rain
Where she's been
And who she's seen
In her journey to the stars.

Who can know
The reasons for her smile
What are her dreams
When they've journeyed for a mile
The way she sings
And her brightly coloured rings
Make her the princess of the sky.

Who can know
What happens in her mind
Did she come from a strange world
And leave her mind behind
Her long lost sighs
And her brightly coloured eyes
Tell her story to the wind.

Who can know
The thoughts of Mary Jane
Why she flies
Or goes out in the rain
Where she's been
And who she's seen
In her journey to the stars.

// Man In A Shed //

Well there was a man who lived in a shed
Spent most of his days out of his head
For his shed was rotten let in the rain
Said it was enough to drive any man insane
When it rained
He felt so bad
When it snowed he felt just simply sad.

Well there was a girl who lived nearby
Whenever he saw her he could only simply sigh
But she lived in a house so very big and grand
For him it seemed like some very distant land
So when he called her
His shed to mend,
She said I'm sorry you'll just have to find a friend.

Well this story is not so very new
But the man is me, yes and the girl is you
So leave your house come into my shed
Please stop my world from raining through my head
Please don't think 
I'm not your sort
You'll find that sheds are nicer than you thought.

// Fruit Tree //

Fame is but a fruit tree
So very unsound
It can never flourish 
Till its stalk is in the ground
So men of fame
Can never find a way
Till time has flown 
Far from their dying day

Forgotten while you're here
Remembered for a while
A much updated rain
From a much updated style

Life is but a memory
Happened long ago
Theatre full of sadness
For a long forgotten show

Seems so easy
Just to let it go on by
Till you stop and wonder
Why you never wondered why
Safe in a womb of an everlasting night
You find the darkness can give the brightest light

Safe in your place deep in the earth
That's when they'll know 
What you are really worth

Forgotten while you're here
Remembered for a while 
A much updated rain
From a much updated style

Fame is but a fruit tree
So very unsound
It can never flourish
Till its stalk is in the ground
So men of fame can never find a way
Till time has flown far from their dying day

Fruit tree
Fruit tree
No one knows you but the rain and the air
Don't you worry
They'll stand and stare when you're gone

Fruit tree 
Fruit tree
Open your eyes to another year
They will know that you were here
when you are gone

// Saturday Sun //

Saturday sun
Came early one morning
In a sky so clear and blue
Saturday sun
Came without warning
So no one knew what to do

Saturday sun
Brought people and faces
That didn't seem much
In their day
But when I remember
Those people and places
They were really too good
In their way
In their way
In their way
Saturday sun 
Won't come and see me today

Think about stories
With reason and rhyme
Circling through your brain
And think about people
In their season and time
Returning again and again
And again
And again
But Saturday's sun
Has turned to Sunday's rain

So Sunday sat
In the Saturday sun
And wept for a day gone by
