Old black mountain
Tried to spit in your face
Old black mountain
Tried to spit in your face
Baby's grubbing whiskey
Oh, she's practicing

Old black mountain
Mean as they can be
Old black mountain
Mean as they can be
They use gunpowder
Just to sweeten the tea

Had a girl in black mountain
Sweetest girl in town
Had a girl in black mountain
Sweetest girl in town
But she met a sweet black man
And then she threw me down

Well, old black mountain
Can't keep man in jail
Old black mountain
Can't keep man in jail
Sure we call him guilty
Judge will cry and bail

Come back to black mountain
Me, my razor and my gun
Come back to black mountain
Me and my razor, my gun
Gonna cut her if she stands there
And shoot her if she runs
