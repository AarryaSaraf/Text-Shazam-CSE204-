Do you ever remember
Now you're so far away
Things that we used to laugh about
Crazy things we'd say
There were so many may times
When every word was a song
There were so many gay times
Before it all went oh so wrong
But time is ever a vagabond
Time was always a thief
Time can steal away happiness
But time can take away grief
So I won't try to remember
For that way leads to regret
No I won't try to remember
What I can never forget
