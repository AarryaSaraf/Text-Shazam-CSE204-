Strolling down the highway
I`m gonna get there my way
Just keep on down-a-walking
You hear my guitar-a-rocking
Well I stroll on down
On down the highway

People think I'm a crazing
Lord above they're lazing
Sunshine's all day long
The garlic's far too strong
Well I stroll on down
On down the highway

Cars won't stop for no one
But don't you think that you're just rolling down
I think you are a spy
shoot them as they go by
Well, no cars no cars
Won't stop for no one

Strolling down the highway
I'm gonna get there my way
Just keep on down-a-walking
You hear my guitar-a-rocking
Well I stroll on down
On down the highway
