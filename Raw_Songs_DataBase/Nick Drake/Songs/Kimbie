Kimbie wants a nine dollar show
Kimbie wants a nine dollar show
She wants a nine dollar show
And I need
Well Kimbie let your hair hang down
Kimbie let your hair hang down

Let your hair hang down
Til it touches the ground
Well Kimbie let your hair hang down

Kimbie let your hair hang down
Let your hair hang down
Cause come the morning I'll be gone
Well Kimbie where you been so long

Well Kimbie where you been so long
I've been down in your state pen
With those rough and rowdy
Rough and rowdy men
Well Kimbie where you been so long

Well Kimbie where you been so long
I've been down in your state pen
And I gotta go back again
Well Kimbie where you been so long

Well I wished I was a mole in the ground
I wished I were a mole in the ground
I was a mole in the ground
And that I'd tear this mountain
I'd tear this mountain down
Wished I was a mole in the ground
