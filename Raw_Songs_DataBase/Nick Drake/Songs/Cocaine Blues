Yonder comes my baby dressed in blue,
hey baby, whatcha gonna do,
cocaine, all around my brain

Yonder comes my baby dressed in white,
hey baby, gonna stay all night
cocaine, all around my brain

hey baby, come here quick,
this old cocaine's gonna make me sick
cocaine, all around my brain

went to be last night and the lights was on
woke up this morning, and my nose was gone,
cocaine, all around my brain

this cocaine's for horses, it ain't for men
the doc says it'll kill me, but he don't say when
cocaine, all around my brain

come here baby, come here quick,
this old cocaine's gonna make me sick,
cocaine's, all around my brain.
