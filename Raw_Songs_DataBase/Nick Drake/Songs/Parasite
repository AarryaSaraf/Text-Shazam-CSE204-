Lifting the mask from a local clown, feeling down like him
Seeing the light in a station bar and traveling far in sin
Sailing downstairs to the northern line, watching the shine of his shoes
Hearing the trials of the people there, who's to care if they lose?

Take a look, you may see me on the ground
For I am the parasite of this town

Dancing a jig in a church with chimes, a sign of the times today
Hearing no bell from a steeple tall, people all in dismay
Falling so far on a silver spoon, making the moon for fun
Changing a robe for a size too small, people all get hung

Take a look, you might see me coming through
For I am the parasite who travels two-by-two

I'm lifting the mask from a local clown, feeling down like him
And I'm seeing the light in a station bar and traveling far in sin
And I'm sailing downstairs to the northern line, watching the shine of his shoes
And hearing the trials of the people there, who's to care if they lose?

Take a look, you might see me on the ground
For I am the parasite of this town
Take a look, you may see me in the dirt
For I am the parasite who hangs from your skirt
