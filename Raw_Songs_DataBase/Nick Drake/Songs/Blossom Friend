Black days of winter all were through
The blossoms came and they brought you
Clouds left the sky
And I knew the reason why
They made way for you and the blossom.

The seasons cycle turned again
An april shower now and then
Trees came alive
And the bees left their hive
They came out to see you and the blossom.

People were laughing, smiling with the sun
They knew that summer had begun.

The nights grew warm, the days grew long
Spring turned to summer and was gone
It seemed so fine
All the cider and the wine
But I knew you'd go with the blossom.

When spring returns I'll look again
To find another blossom friend
Until I do
Find something new
I'll just think of you and the blossom.
