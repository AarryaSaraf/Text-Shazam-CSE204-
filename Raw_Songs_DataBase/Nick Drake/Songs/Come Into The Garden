In the bright red sky
In the heat of an evening
When only prisoners sleep
She said she couldn't
Come to the garden
See an old man weep
She said her dreams were too far to be thought of
Her scars too wide to heal
She said she couldn't come to the garden
See a blind man kneel
She sailed away to a blue horizon
In floating thoughts she'd sway
She said she couldn't come to the garden
See an old man pray
She wished them luck as they left on their journey
Maybe she'd join them soon
But she lost her grip at the tip of life's fingers
Went home and worshiped the moon
