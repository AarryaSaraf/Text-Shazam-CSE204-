Winter is gone
And the leaves are green
Winter is gone
And the leaves turn green
Your innocent face
I wish I never had seen

Come on, my love
And pay the world
Come on, my love
And pay the world
You cheated me
But I wish you well

Rope is bought
And the bough is swung
Rope is bought
And the bough is swung
An innocent man
This day will be hung

Come on, my love
And see me die
Come on, my love
And see me die
See me dancing
Dancing neath the sky
'Neath those gallows high
Come on and see me die

Winter is gone
And the leaves are green
Winter is gone
And the leaves are green
Your innocent face
I wish I never had seen
