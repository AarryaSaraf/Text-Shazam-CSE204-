A day once dawned and it was beautiful
A day once dawned from the ground
Then the night she fell and the air was beautiful
The night she fell all around

So look, see the days
The endless coloured ways
And go play the game that you learned
From the morning

And now we rise and we are everywhere
And now we rise from the ground
And see she flies, and she is everywhere
See she flies all around

So look, see the sights
The endless summer nights
And go play the game that you learned
From the morning
