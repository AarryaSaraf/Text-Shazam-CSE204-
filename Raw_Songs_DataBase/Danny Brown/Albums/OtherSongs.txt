// Lean Beef Patty //

... in the morning
Maybe we could start a family
I wanna see your pretty face
Someone who truly understands, how to treat a man
Oh yeah, oh yeah
This is what I need

[JPEGMAFIA:]
First off, fuck Elon Musk
Eight dollars too much, this past expensive
For the hoes in the back and the cracks in the slack
If I tweet then delete then I meant it (Uh)
I don't really need a check, 'cause I got no respect
And these niggas might know me like a dentist (Uh-huh)
Said he all about these beats
So he hear some shit and then get offended (Uh, let's go!)
This ain't what you want (Let's go), no, this ain't what you want
Ah, fuck y'all niggas, I feel like Papa John (Insane)
Laughin' straight to the bank, I'm Tony Khan (Khan)
And they hate what I say 'cause I ain't wrong (Hate 'cause I ain't wrong, uh)
What kind of rappin' is this? The kind that make rap niggas pissed (You know it)
I put the dough on my bitch, that pussy ain't feelin' like this, she know it
These niggas be textin' with kids, it doesn't get stranger than this, that's hoe shit
Fuck a bar, I don't fuck with you niggas like I'm Hulk Hogan (Wait)
I am mean
Rittenhouse with the shot, and repeat
While you stretchin' the truth in your tweets
I been stretchin' your girl, Iron Sheik
What's the deets?
In the crib, drinkin' Soylent for weeks (For weeks)
Watch your energy, watch what you tweet
You can go from Elon to Ye in a week, buddy (Buddy, buddy, buddy)

[Danny Brown:]
Numb the shots with that antidote
Blacked out, we can't take no more
So get away before shit get slow
Even if I've seen it before
Behind the scenes, on that crack room flow
Smokin' up, I don't need no more
So let me tell you 'bout where we gon' go
Know your place, you won't act wrong, B
You ain't gotta lie, hit this anarchy
In your head, girl, I'm rent free
She can't stop thinkin' 'bout me
So drop it low, like you're pickin' up change
Go'n head girl, do your thing
So bust up, and then what's up?
Spittin' fast like Busta
You might need to trust her
Feel like I love ya

// Brown Eyes //

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
My Uncle offa Blow, nodding while he standing up
Minute's been stuck like he picking something up
Rolling up the swisher with the second near my nuts
While I'm puffin on a Lucie, talkin bout the latest truck
And Hi (how) I'm a come up and get one next summer
So next summer won't be talking bout next summer
Yo bitch is a runner, my niggas had fun with her
Did the whole team and heard you put a gun to her
Homie that ain't pimpin, soft hearted for these hoes
I feeds em lots of pills, and put coke up in they nose
Go to thrift stores, drop a buck on t-shirts
Lines in the dressing room then she bought a cheap purse
Straight up out the hut with some suburb hoes
Expensive perfume and some new old clothes
Cuss it ain't high end, ain't gotta be vintage
She buy her own drinks and week supply of spinach

[Verse 2: Daniel Sewell]
Now baby break it down just to build it back up
Copped a couple pounds, then help me bag it up
A pill and a half now a nigga acting up...
Drunk too much, now a nigga throwing up
But that was last night, nigga I'm still drinking
Smoking on the purple got a nigga pupil shrinking
Plotting on a Lincoln, get it with the ink pin
You Fucking with me, my nigga what you thinking
Your bars too immature this is grown man flow
And that's why my bitches grown with some grown man dough
You're fucking with them youngins, on the phone with them hoes
I text a bitch a message now she knockin' at the door
Naw that's the pill man, let me get four
I swear this the last time, I won't do it no more
But said that last week, and now a nigga back
Fuck it, It ain't like a nigga smoking crack

// Cartier //

[Verse 1:]
Catch you slippin' with them all white Buffies
Take that like Puffy
I'll Leave a nigga with some shit stains
Leave blood stains all on them wood frames
Catch you slippin' with your feet up
Nigga, fuck that, even beat your bitch up
Catch you walkin' round North Lyn with Ye's on
Run up on her, snatch those, now they gone
I can get 400 for these wire frames
Fresh out the box, no scratches, mayne
Real deal dawg, no fake shit
Transition lens, nigga take shit
Seen a nigga with them old school Mayfairs
Caught a two piece, at the state fair
Seen a nigga at the Coney with some ice in him
Now the doctor tryin' to put some fuckin' life in him
That's how it is in the city of the motor
Where a nigga doin' what he gotta do to get a quarter
Dime, nickle, penny
Automatic, semi
Catch a nigga with' them Cartiers and I'm like "gimme"
That's why we four deep in this Regal
Bangin' rock bottom, dirty Desert Eagle
Finna hit the club, you know what's up
You got some Cartiers, you gettin' fucked up

[Hook:]
And we goin' in the party
And we snatchin' niggas Cartys
I say we goin' in the party
And we snatchin' niggas Cartys
We goin' in the party
And we snatchin' niggas Cartys

[Verse 2:]
I seen a pair of woods, twenty two hundred
I seen a nigga with' em, I told that nigga run it
I leave a nigga dalmatian for them Malmaisons
For them rosewoods, roses where you stood
And I think them wood frames better on me
Sold 'em for six, coulda got a G
You think you real, g? That heater on your ass
Lose your life over Cartier glasses
I'm where you get caved over shades
Wood on your caskets, flower on your graves
You think them wire frames shinin'?
I'll be at the pawn shop before this rhyme end
And I'm 'bout to get cake
Come to find out that this nigga glasses was fake
It's all good, g, it's aight
That's why I'm bout to hit the club tonight

// Express Yourself //

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Bet your towels on war how, bounce that ass like a pogo
Shake and roll like a crab game in Las Vegas casino
Call up one of them freak hoes that bounce that ass to that Diplo
She take a dip, then take a sip, dip dip dip
All I want her do is make her ride this dick
Bouncin' on that ass while she bitin' on her lip
Really wanna grope when she look back at it
With a look on her face like she just did match
Jean phones cost about eighteen hundred
Pop a little pill so you know I stay blemmy
Blowin' that sticky now it's time to get freaky take a dip in the back rubber gun in my finger
Tanga got me rollin'
Thing she keep on woah
No way that I'm controllin' so I gotta put cheat code
We smokin' on that potent, drinking on that potion she turnt up,
Hopped in her hand stand bounced that ass in slow motion

[Hook x2: Danny Brown]
Say oh my God, little mama be twerking hard
When she back that thang, she clapped that thang, she for sure got my dick hard

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
And I just wanna take her home and wear you out
Given free, no cashin' out
Eatin on your pussy got you squirtin' on your blouse
Hit it from the back on the living room couch
You wanna thing that your man won't do
Before bust one bitch you gotta bust too
Run around to got to do what it do cause I just did me so you gotta do you
Trapstar girls keep twerking it,
Let me see what you working with
I'm watching you and I'm wondering if you can do that with my dick in her hand
Her ass lookin' ridiculous, make me want to get in it
I swear to God she got angry, don't stop girl keep gettin' it

[Bridge x2: Danny Brown]
Toes on the wall and her ass in the air
And she twerk that thing like she ain't have a care

[Hook x2]
Express yourself, express yourself [x4]
Gon' girl express yourself

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Pop the pussy before I go nigga
I'll be coming out soon nigga
So if you ain't in tune nigga
Ratchet...
Pop the pussy before I goon nigga
I'll be coming out soon nigga
So if you ain't in tune nigga
Ratchet...
Make like from your hair to your toes
Can't hurt your man with some hell naw
Between me and you girl keep it on the low
Everytime I come around you know it's a freak show
Four bad hoes in my hotel room
Fuckin on the pillows while I sleep til noon
Trippin' on the molly and startin to go party with big nut pussy... soup
Ain't no way ya'll fuckin with this
Ain't fuckin with this
My time game good no ice on my wrists and a big long dick
Some hit me up when you need the help
Dig your R's til you ain't gone left
Had your ass screamin' before I took off my belt
Gon' girl express yourself

[Hook x2]

// Fresh Off The Boat //

Fresh off the boat
You can tell the way I wear my clothes
That I'm fresher than a scent from a rock
Fresh off the boat
You can tell the way I wear my gold
That I shine anywhere around the globe
Fresh off the boat
Getting mine everywhere I go
So if you don't know homie now you know
Fresh off the boat
And homie I demand my respect
Everywhere I go I rep my set
I'm fresh off the boat

[Outro x2:]
Homie, you don't know where I come from
But I know where I'ma go
Fresh off the boat

// Grown Up //

[Verse 1:]
Remember when my first meal was school lunch
Now I spit a 16 straight with no punch
Remember all for dinner all we ate was Captain Crunch
Now we blow big blunts on the way to brunch
Went from good fella to commissary slips
Now I got back up man every time I slipped
Never ever quit, I just kept on pursuing
Teacher always ask me, what was I doing
Scribbled in my notebook and never did homework
Low attention span, guess these Adderall worked
Rocked Tommy Hil shirts, ones with the boat
Rockport kicks way before we even smoked
Used to have baby lungs, choking when I hit it
Nowadays lace a whole seven in a sitting
Remember back then we thought we growed up
Rushing at a kid just to be grown up

[Hook:]
Rushing at a kid just to be grown up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up

[Verse 2:]
I can eat a pound and shit sixty four quarters
Burn up fire and drown drops of water
Son, I told you I got them beans like Goya
Gone off them pills got me jumping off the sofa
Hotter than a Hot Pocket out the devil microwave
Model bitches begging just be a nigga's sex slave
Exotic foreign garments lookin' tailor made
And when these bitches see me man they wetter than the everglades
Everyday same shit, me getting paid
Waking up, new bitch, it's me getting laid
Used to take bottle back, waitress bring the bottle back
Now they see me shining and they looking like a Sour Patch
Niggas catch a heart attack, Newport soft pack never blow blunt wraps
But these blunt raps sewn up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up

[Hook]

// Head For Free //

CHECK!
Joker
Bruiser

Yeah
Burn an ounce to this
Bitch I put my house on it
That if I pull my dick out
You gon' put your mouth on it
I know you wanna bounce on it
And look back at me with confidence
But if you don't spend no pounds on it then
We gon' have some consequence

Bitch show me what that mouth do
Spit all on it like "achoo"
That boy Ra like Afu
That bitch nasty like dog food
Pulled up in the old school
But them clothes is all new
Them hoes be like who you
But them white hoes they already knew

Now she all up on my thang
This Alexander ring
A couple grams of cocaine
Now we up in P.F. Chang's
Keep going back to that bathroom
I said snort that shit off the bar
A couple shots of that Cuervo
Now she suckin my dick in the car

Now we chewin' on a pill
'Bout the size of this bitch nipple
And when that wind blow hard
You can hear that asshole whistle
That's the type of bitch I like
That's the kind of ho I love
A blond hair blue-eyed ho
With some dried up blood in her nose

Now I know nothin' 'bout you
But I know a whole lot 'bout me
And one thing's for certain
I ain't paying for that pussy
So if what's in your knees gon' cost me a fee
Call me cheap and give that head up for free

Now give me head for free
Head for free, head for free
Cause you ain't gettin' my money
Give me head for free
Head for free, head for free
Cause you ain't gettin' my money
Give me head for free
Head for free, head for free
Cause you ain't gettin' my money

Style!
Now give me head for free
Head for free
Pitchfork
Style!

// Hottest MC //

[Verse 1:]
Fuck any rapper rappin' if the nigga ain't dappin'
Show respect, I'm the greatest - oh shit, I killed your ladies
I don't give a fuck if you've got a billion dollars
Your rhymes are cheap, you release a poor product
You a servant in my world, the rap gods curse you
When judgement day's upon you, reality's a virtue
I walked a thousand miles recitin' a hundred rhymes
Brought smiles to faces, braced, labels owe me from lines
I don't give a fuck, a dirty Detroit nigga
Ain't-got-the-bud-but-show-up-with-a-Swisher-ass nigga
Say "bitch, I'm still hungry", they actin' like I made it
I ain't make it 'til my mama fuckin' sittin' on some acres
I'm a motherfuckin' threat in the booth, these niggas know
Poet of the century, decades later they quote it
Deserve a Nobel Peace Prize for what I recite
Incite a riot with the speech, I'm Detroit Red on ecstasy
Sores on my scalp 'cause my last perm burnt me
Hair straight, jumpin' head first in an orgy
With a pool of blonde hoes, sniffin' on that white shit
So much caucasian pussy, starting to think that I'm mixed
But I be writin' that shit, have you rappers pissed, like
"How'd he think of this? I wish I'd thought of that shit"
Rhymes so real thought I wrote it in Janice Joplin's vomit
With the mic GG Allin wiped his ass with...

[Verse 2:]
I carry the cross for anybody lost or findin' it rough
Days of no sunshine like a maze in my mind
No enter or exit, Adderall anorexic
Pill-poppin' dyslexic, naughty nature Treach shit
I think about my next line like you think of the next dime
I'm the future and the present, same damn time
An OG told me "you're only as nice as your last bar"
So with that said, suck my dick all y'all
The Motor City where motor mouths get impounded
I'm overseas in Australia, lookin' for the blonders
Ksubi jeans, and Ann Demeulermeester
And she like my shoes so I put it in her kiester
It's the hybrid like I wrote it in papyrus
Keep the shit on me, nigga, hood rat, baby diaper
They heatin' up Caprice like a DC sniper
Raised off of hotdogs, down-the-middle split 'em
I'm hotter than Andre Rison with Left Eye
Rest in peace, baby, but no T-L-C in my life
And when I reach my fate, and I'm standin' at the gates
Know that God'll be proud, sayin' "Daniel, you was great"
But you other niggas? 'Pac said he want an explanation
Big turned in his grave, an earthquake in Grenada
When Pun shed a tear it hurricane for a week
When Big L get upset, it start tornadoing trees

// Jealousy //

[Hook:]
The cheddar breed jealousy...
The cheddar breed jealousy
Especially if that man fucked up

[Verse 1:]
Y'all don't know where I come from, nigga
You don't know what I've been through, hoe
Said I wasted my time, huh?
Look, bitch, I done told you so
I done got on my own shit
I ain't need your help, though
Bitch, I know I did it
You ain't gotta tell me so
I done come a long way, I'm grindin', grindin'
Really, I ain't really have shit
Now your bitch see me shinin', prime-timin'
And she all up on my dick
'Cause she know I'm ballin', ballin'
J. J. Redick comin' off that pit
Shake, take pics, open up her mouth
And my dick is about to go switch
Bitch, it's... Danny Motherfuckin' Brown
And you know I'm in beast mode
So bitch go run them c-notes
She come through naked in a pea coat
'Cause she know she about to deep throat
Rubbin' on her clit, playin' with her pee hole
Lookin' like she playin' Guitar Hero
You niggas ain't in my league, hoe
My flow's so down, my lingo
No nigga, you ain't my amigo
No senor, you no chico
I do not speak no Spanish
So I don't know what that mean, yo
I met this Filipino, and she was jalapeño

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Get up off of your ass, nigga
Worried about my fuck, boy
I don't love that bitch
Hoe just my fuck toy
Got the game in an uproar
Y'all are lames and so boring
Now your bitch got her tits out
Tryna get my laundry - oh boy!
I'm on some other shit
'Cause y'all done got me fucked up
Y'all don't know who y'all fuckin' with
I'm a Linwood nigga 'til I'm dead in the grave
Detroit techno, shootin' off weight
Nigga'd overtake ya back in the day
Don't make me go back to that nigga in the braids
Raised wrong, caged, but a nigga escaped
So bitch-nigga, don't make me take that bait
Niggas in the hood got love for me
No Limits, got Dungarees
So I'm just tryna smoke my weed
Tell me where the hoes at
All up in my cell phone
Nigga you already know that
So I'm a call some hoes up
Tell 'em bring some drink through
We gon' have a party
Called up your man Achbo
So last song, gettin' fucked up
'Cause we ain't worried 'bout it
Smokin' on that Master P
Bitch we 'bout it, 'bout it

[Hook]

// Kool Aid //

You fruits get pints to stir up, bust your girlfriend cherry
Smoking on that grape and that be rolled up in strawberry
Niggas saw her ass, that lemonade
When they see them hoes on my dick, they be like...

Get the fuck up out of my mix
Get out my like Kool-Aid, my Kool-Aid
Get up out my mix
Get up out my Kool-Aid, my Kool-Aid
Get up out my mix
Get up out my Kool-Aid, my Kool-Aid
Get up out my mix
Get up out my Kool-Aid, my Kool-Aid
Get the fuck up out of my mix

Your hoe ate my dick off, call that hoe a cannibal
Coming down like Santa Claus
Her pussy furry like panda paws
Beat a pussy ass nigga with the jabber jaws
Talk about shit they weren't involved
Be like, "Get the fuck up out of my mix"
Nosy ass niggas always in my business
Wonder how I got it and wonder how I get it
Wonder where we keep it and they wonder where we spend it
Run up on me then we run up where you're living
Tell you one thing and you're back, nah forget it
Disrespect me then we come up where you're living
Worry 'bout me, better worry about yourself
Your family, your friends, be worried 'bout their health
See I'm tired of all of these pocket-watchers
Niggas watching my pockets
Wanna know where I spend it at, tryna figure out how I got it
When everything I said working
Then you wonder why you're hurting
If you ain't got the assertion, better get up out and do something
See my best advice is just stop it, nigga
'Cause you ain't gon' do nothing
You a pop-lock-it and drop-it nigga, a bitch nigga be trouble
Drop a pack in that water, now I whip, whip and then serve it
Drop a pack in that water, now I whip, whip and then serve it

Get up out my Kool-Aid, my Kool-Aid
Get up out my mix
Get out my Kool-Aid, my Kool-Aid
Get up out my mix
Get out my Kool-Aid, my Kool-Aid
Get up out my mix
Get out my Kool-Aid, my Kool-Aid
Get the fuck up out of my mix

Drop a pack up in that water, now I whip, whip and then serve it
Drop a pack in that water, now I whip, whip and then serve it
Pack in that water, now I whip, whip and then serve it
Pack in that water, now I whip, whip and then serve it

I can't feel my face now, but I feel that bass now
Do a girl from the waist down
I'ma knock the boots like H-Town
Out there looking at me like Mase now
Touch and tease like Case now
Gone 'head, just break it down
Bring it back, come back around
Niggas talk worse than bitches
So out here gotta watch who you kick it with
Spread rumors, they Texas
Circle smaller than [?]
Tell you one thing, girl, you better not forget it
Disrespect me then we coming where you living
Worry 'bout me, better worry about yourself
Family and friends, be worried 'bout their health
Tired of all of these pocket-watchers
Niggas always watching my pockets
Wanna know where I get it at, they wanna know how I got it
Everything I said working
And you wonder why you're hurting
If you ain't got the assertion, better get up out and do something
See my best advice is just stop it, nigga
'Cause you ain't gon' do nothing
You a pop-lock-it and drop-it nigga, a bitch nigga, that's right
Drop a pack in that water, now I whip, whip and then serve it
Drop a pack in that water, now I whip, whip and then serve it

[Verse 1]
Take another hit and I pass out, rapping like I'm ashed out
Sneaking bitches up, when granny passed out
So ho, what that ass 'bout? No I ain't going to cash out before a little fame
You could get that ass mashed out, bitch I'm on that cash route
Ain't looking for a rest stop
They talk about modelling, might say I need a head shot
I need a dollar for everyone born out of wedlock
Tryina make the breast out, calling up the dreadlocks
Bitch, I'm on my peso, hablo dinero
And your bitch want me to go TP on her bung-hole
I got these rap niggas saying "Uncle"
While I beep-beep, pull on the hair of a Rapunzel
Think about me and masturbate with the faucet
Bout to take the game and put that bitch up in the closet

[Hook]
But in the end I'm just a dirty old man
With a pill in my mouth and my dick in my hand

[Verse 2]
Mind of a pervert with words I submerge
On the verge of O.D'in for the shit that I say
But who gives a fuck, I'm still gon' do this shit anyway
A dirty nigga from Detroit at the end of the day
So when the night fall I be gettin' head in the alley
By a low down nothing 2 dollar skully
Let her use her own rubber, bullshit trojan
Dick too big, nigga I was stuffed in
Bitch I'm David Ruffin and ruffles no stuffing
Bundles of Peruvian snow with his shirt tucked in
Lookin' at the rest of you artist like you nothing
Know that I'm the shit so I don't say shit
But when these rappers rap, dog they don't say shit
And I'm George Carlin, fucked a June to August

[Hook]

// Radio Head //

I don't wanna rep with ya
Molotov the studio, hot tracks nigga
I sip liquor with bitches that owe tuition
After this they kiss n' strippin in the 69 position
And I came a long way from the dirty matress flippin
Malnutrition, now I'm comming in thuition
So fuck your superstitions
I'm with a cooler [?]
I've got that [?] crip vs piru adrenaline
With the mind of einstein, that collumbine
Like jefferson fist fighting with eddison
I knock your lights out
I take a shit in the white house and don't flush
Then pull my dick out on oprah...
Be like "I gotcha bitch"
Now that's real talk not fucking Dave Chappelle skits
And I bet you she be wetter than some whale piss
I put it in her pelvis and now I'm eating sword fish
Blowin circles of purple knowing nothin's for certain
Fuck the wiser surgeon bust a nut on their curtains
Everyday always stay on the low like I'm thirsting
Niggas handcuffin nurses and buyin em' purses
Fuck buyin em burkins they worthless like cursive
My purses is purchest I'm the one that they flirt with
The surface is circus clowns
My verses is curses
I cop it and break it down
The workers are chirpin
Leader of the newschool in an old school
Niggas tofu, bruise off the pro-tools
Rep my alanski loosing all his sanity, layin on a canopy
Thinkin how it can be
Player hating niggas allways blocking like Camby
Take the mocho out of man now he's just a randy
Blowin on the candy
[?]
Adderals and zanny
Always come in handy, yeah
I'm on the streets like a wino
I see that pussy just like a [?]
Got these bitches chargin head first like rhino
Remember when they used to rock madana's with the rhynestones
Now they lookin like the shitted out a pinecone
Diamond in the ruff been found and it's a fine stone
Fine two flow going over heads ho
Mind been blown ever since she gave me head ho

// Ready To Go //

[Channel Tres:]
Yo, girl, you thick, can I have some more?
Can I have some more? (Uh)
You been here before, guess you indigo
Guess you indigo (Indigo)
Don't act like you're rich, just go for broke
Just go for broke (Uh)
You see me right now, yeah, I'm ready to go (Check!)
Yeah, I'm ready to go, ah

Go

[Danny Brown:]
Click that thang like tambourines (Stuh!)
I'm tryna tap that like [?] (Yeah!)
Clockwise, southside, let me in between (Uh, huh)
Wavy with the honey, and I'm tryna sing (Aight)
Ayy, ayy, ayy, what you mean? (Hey)
Got my hair puffed up like ex marine (Hey)
Walk out that jack, you trust the king (Hey)
That ass so fat, bustin' out them jeans (Ah, woo!)
Bust it open, look back at it (Yeah)
Losin' my mind, like a crack addict (Yeah)
Losin' my breath, gettin' asthmatic (Yeah)
'Cause a [?], did a jackrabbit (Stuh!)
Lookin' back, baby, look at it (Uh!)
Wait, rollin' safe and I want the addict (Uh!)
Wow, like a bad habit (Uh!)
Oh, I really gotta have it (Yeah!)

[Channel Tres:]
Meet me at my place

Double-take, got me lookin' back
Meet me at my place
Your face, Bombay
More bass
Illustrates slow shape
Double-take, got me lookin' back

[Danny Brown:]
Back up on it like dumps in a truck
Dan make a player just wanna go guts
I be gettin' clunked 'cause they get one time
That thing jiggle even when she strut
Ayy, ayy, know what's up
Tryna get behind it when you're doin' toe-tucks
Shootin' my shot and I'm hittin' in the clubs
Make a player just wanna go nuts
Work that shit, let me have some more
Let me take the red off, let me crack the go
Could you get up on it while you drop it low
You already know I'm read' to go
No, throw it on me, baby girl, throw it back
Know where I'm goin' but you got me off track
God damn, girl, just how you do that?
Make me wanna double take, got me lookin' back

// Sweeney Song //

[Verse 1]
Nine out of ten of these rap niggas is Play-Doh®
I say "go", niggas'll spray your whip like Mako®
Ya got that yayo for the low, you'd swear that Kanye was here
The way they say "where did yay go?"
My flow strong like it's on that 'Sé Canseco
I don't eat rappers, I box them up like take-home
Get straight dome from a bi bitch
I don't know her name, but told her girlfriend to switch
And the lyrics coalesce, I rip elaborate
Hazardous material that's oh so immaculate
Accurate position, when I spit this shit, it's calculus
Hard, nigga...
And that was bars, nigga...
I'm off them Xany footballs, nigga
Swisher, I don't buff, kush shuffs 'til I fall, nigga
Too high to fuckin' talk...
That's why I never call, nigga...
Your bitch keep textin' and she want it all, nigga...

[Hook]
Yeah - and I've got two on a brew
Let's go cup-for-cup until that ma'fucka through
And I've got five on a bag
Before you toss that square, can a nigga get a drag?
And I used to spend late nights starin' at the ceiling
Pitch-black dark, but I had that feelin'
Vision of killin' niggas, bein' labelled a villain
Because these labels passed, I'mma make these niggas pass

[Verse 2]
Late night, searchin' websites for victims
Fuck doin' features, you niggas competition
That's your assistant on the blunt run?
Give her stomach blows 'til I puncture her lungs
And it's some nigga shit I fuck with in my spare time
But they can't fuck with me in my mind
Used to be humble, now I'm feelin' cocky
'Cause all these bitches ride it like a fuckin' Kawasaki
And these rap niggas see my face in they dreams
They worst fuckin' nightmare wearin' fuckin' skinny jeans
Wake in cold sweat, my reflection in the mirror
Put a curse on a Freshman 10, watch how it end
Dropped out of high school at sixteen
'Bout the same time as the Wu dropped "Ice Cream"
Arguin' with fiends, starin' at the screen
Watchin' Rap City like it was all a dream
Spent my last three bucks on a Source magazine
Hip-Hop Shop where niggas was battlin'
But I was writin' shit in my fuckin' Composition
Knowin' one day I would have these critics trippin'
Sayin' that, niggas, I'mma be the future
New take on rap, this ain't what ya used to
Push this shit fuckin' forward
Focus on the music so the people will support it
A load on my shoulder, tell the world
I'm meetin' my goals, watch my plans unfurl
Check!
Yeah...

[Hook 2]
Yeah - and I've got two on a brew
Let's go cup-for-cup until that motherfucker through
And I've got five on a bag
Before you toss that, nigga, let me get a drag?
Used to spend late nights starin' at the ceiling
Pitch-black dark, now I had that feelin'
Vision of killin' niggas, bein' labelled a villain
Because these labels passed, I'mma make these niggas pass

I wanted to pay this and the plug wanted that
We met in the middle because opposites attract
I cut the pack, make the brick collapse
I [?] bitches to do things when my fingers snap
Uh, I never lost a challenge
Boy and girl in my home, I'm a foster parent
Run with the lions, berry
Pounds of the loud, very
Drinkin' Dom Peri', I'm with Danny Brown
And a blonde bitch with no belly
Uh, whole things ain't make it enough
I'm shaving weight like Hydroxycut, uh
'Til my profits start proppin' up, uh
It's a part of the business to go away for years, like the Olympics
Can I get a witness? Huh, you better say no
You ain't seen nothin'
I grew up with niggas that didn't wanna be nothin'
