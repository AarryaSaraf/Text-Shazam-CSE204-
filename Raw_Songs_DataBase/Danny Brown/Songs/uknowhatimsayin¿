My guy, you no walk, you no jog
My guy, you big boss, you so bad
You see this time wait for nobody
My guy, just hold your composure
And when you're down it gets cold, I know, uh
My guy, don't stop now, keep movin'
My guy, don't stop now, keep movin'

Don't know nothin', but I do know this
Don't know nothin', but I do know this
Don't know nothin', but I do know this

My guy, you no walk, you no jog
My guy, you big boss, you so bad
You see this time wait for nobody
My guy, just hold your composure
And when you're down it gets cold, I know, uh
My guy, don't stop now, keep movin'
My guy, don't stop now, keep movin'
