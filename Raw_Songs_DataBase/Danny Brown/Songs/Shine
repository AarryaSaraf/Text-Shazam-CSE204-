19s but I keep them plain, though
Leather inside, dark tinted window
Wood-grain wheel, tell me how you really feel?
Why I pass, all they kids yellin' out, "Bingo"
Talk a good game, Trey Wingo
Speak in code so nobody know the lingo
Life like a dice game, ain't no casino
Street light contra, ain't no cheat code
Every day on the line like a free throw
Shit weak, like the knees on D-Rose
I was taught look out for your people
Meet Heaven, then ya gotta know evil
Heart of lion, eye of a eagle
Life a movie but ain't no sequel
Switch lanes in that new thang
Got it in redline while I'm playin' Flock of Seagulls
So, no way we could ever be equal
In the haystack I was that needle
Hold it in, thinkin' no on would believe you
Lose it all in a second like me too
The ho or the seafood
Gun shots echo, never be peaceful
Smokin' Diesel to forget it all
If I ain't do nothin' I'ma ball

Ay, gotta get what's mine
Ay, before I lose my mind
Ay, like I'm runnin' outta time
Ay, shine, like man, shine

Breakdown, lockdown, run up on 'em all
Standin' on the corner, you can see me, I'ma ball
Breakdown, lockdown, run up on 'em all
Standin' on the corner, you can see me, I'ma ball
Breakdown, lockdown, run up on 'em all
Standin' on the corner, you can see me, I'ma ball
Breakdown, lockdown, run up on 'em all
Standin' on the corner, you can see me, I'ma ball

Ay, gotta ball till ya fall
In a system that designed, one strike, take it all
Ay, all it take, one call
Pray you lose it all, one second, all gone
Ay, know you feelin' all alone
But who can you turn to when things go wrong?
Ay, it's plot all along
Push you down the wrong path, the statistics have shown
Everything that I'd known, turned out to be lies
Found out when I was grown so I shared that light
On these dark undertones, had a nigga head gone
S'why they buy the diamonds and that Perc' is shiny chrome
My fault, all alone in the scheme of it all
Played like a bong, had to stay strong
Kept my head above water, had to keep movin' on
Had my head above water, had to keep movin' on

Ay, gotta get what's mine
Ay, before I lose my mind
Ay, like I'm runnin' outta time
Ay, shine, like man, shine

Breakdown, lockdown, run up on 'em all
Standin' on the corner, you can see me, I'ma ball
Breakdown, lockdown, run up on 'em all
Standin' on the corner, you can see me, I'ma ball
Breakdown, lockdown, run up on 'em all
Standin' on the corner, you can see me, I'ma ball
Breakdown, lockdown, run up on 'em all
Standin' on the corner, you can see me, I'ma ball

The dream is realized, my heart skips a beat
I'm tyin' my feet, if baby can't sleep
The feat that's unreached, furnace relaxed
The weed that's unsown, white men will attack
Fact that's unlocked, dread that's untied
Mind can explode, time it can't tide
