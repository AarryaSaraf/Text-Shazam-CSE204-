You can act stupid if you want to
Never play by the rules, do just what I want to
Came up in this bitch strong, got without a strong front tooth
Now who they say is number one influence? So, he number two
Yeah, he dance good, but guess where he got the moves?
But compared to me, look like he wear two left shoes
Boy, I treat them little virgins like the restroom
Take my hand and dance with the Devil
Oh, boy, you in trouble, rattled the lion cage
Told God spray ya down while you're prayin' on stage
Jit at your burial, smoke squares at your grave
Then repent for my sins like, "God I'm saved"
He always forgive, later on, I forget
I had my fingers crossed so I'm back on that shit
Catch another body 'fore the song get mixed
The bullets is the lyrics, turn the rapper to a spirit
Singin' with the angels, nigga long gone
This song's like Bishop Ali Wong with a thong on
Nigga, I'm the wrong one to run on
My balls on her Kit-kat, now she playin' ping-pong

Nigga, this the theme song for bitch ass niggas
Got a little richer, now their head all bigger
Nigga, this the theme song for bitch ass niggas
Got a little richer, now their head all bigger

Listen here, little Richard, I don't know what got into you
Did mo' for the game than you
That's why I had to cut into ya, you need to be checked
Lil niggas need to learn some respect
When your show's like The Rockettes with some majorettes
Give me a mic and the DJ and I'm set
'Cause these bars on deck, ain't gotta shake my ass
You the real definition of ants in yo' pants
Gotta son, lil niggas, no child support
Sorta like the Bad Boys up against Jordan
But nigga, you ain't scorin', not on me
Wrote this one on one knee, RIP the P
Taught me to keep it real, stand on my own
If I got to, rock a nigga brain with his nose blown
No time for the gimmicks and
I ain't gotta lie when I say I'm independent

Nigga, this the theme song for bitch ass niggas
Got a little richer, now their head all bigger
Nigga, this the theme song for bitch ass niggas
Got a little richer, now their head all bigger
