// My Secret Place //

I'm going to take you to
My special place
It's a place that you
Like no one else I know
Might appreciate
I don't go there with anyone but
You're a special case
For my special place
For my secret place

People talk to tell you something
Or to take up space
Guess I'm only talking
To be talking to
Your pretty face
I don't talk much to anyone but
You're a special case
For my special place
My secret place

I was born and raised
In New York City
I'm just getting used to Colorado
Oh street bravado
Carry me
Why did you bring me to
A place so wild and pretty?
Are there pigeons in this park
Muggers after dark
In these golden trees
In the secret place?

I'm going to take you to
My special place
It's a place no amount of hurt and anger
Can deface
I put things back together there
It all falls right in place
In my special space
My special place

Once I saw a film
In New York City
That was shot in Colorado
Girl meets desperado
In the trembling mountain trees
Out of all of the girls that you see
In bleachers and cafe windows
Sitting flirting with someone
Looking to have some fun
Why did you pick me?
For the secret place

// Lakota //

I am Lakota!
Lakota!
Looking at money man
Diggin' the deadly quotas
Out of balance
Out of hand

We want the land!
Lay down the reeking ore
Don't you hear the shrieking in the trees?
Everywhere you touch the earth she's sore
Every time you skin her all things weep
Your money mocks us
Restitution what good can it do?
Kenneled in metered boxes
Red dogs in debt to you

I am Lakota!
Lakota!
Fighting among ourselves
All we can say with one whole heart
Is we won't sell
No we'll never sell

We want the land!
The lonely coyote calls
In the woodlands footprints of the deer
In the barrooms poor drunk bastard falls
In the courtrooms deaf ears sixty years
You think we're sleeping but
Quietly like rattlesnakes and stars
We have seen the trampled rainbows
In the smoke of cars

I am Lakota
Brave
Sun pity me
I am Lakota
Broken
Moon pity me
I am Lakota
Grave
Shadows stretching
Lakota
Oh pity me

I am Lakota
Weak
Grass pity me
I am Lakota
Faithful
Rocks pity me
I am Lakota
Meek
Standing water
Lakota
Oh pity me

I am Lakota!
Lakota!
Standing on sacred land
We never sold these Black Hills
To the missile heads
To the power plants

We want the land!
The bullet and the fence broke Lakota
The black coats and the booze broke Lakota
Courts that circumvent choke Lakota
Nothing left to lose
Tell me grandfather
You spoke the fur and feather tongues
Do you hear the whimpering waters
When the tractors come?

I am Lakota
Brave
Sun pity me
I am Lakota
Broken
Moon pity me
I am Lakota
Slave
Shadows stretching
Lakota
Oh pity me

I am Lakota
Weak
Grass pity me
I am Lakota
Faithful
Rocks pity me
I am Lakota
Meek
Standing water
Lakota
Oh pity me

Sun pity me
Mother earth
Mother
Moon pity me
Father sky
Father
Shadows
Stretching on the forest floor
Mother earth
Oh pity me

Father sky
Father
Grass pity me
Mother earth
Mother
Rocks pity me
Father sky
Father
Water
Standing in a wakan manner
Mother earth
Oh pity me

Father sky
Father
Sun pity me
Mother earth
Mother
Moon pity me
Father sky
Father
Shadows
Stretching on the forest floor
Mother earth
Oh pity me

Father sky
Father
Grass pity me
Mother earth
Mother
Rocks pity me
Father sky

// The Tea Leaf Prophecy (Lay Down Your Arms) //

Study war no more
Lay down your arms
Study war no more
Lay 'em down lay 'em down now
Study war no more
Lay down your arms
Study war no more

Newsreels rattle the Nazi dread
The able-bodied have shipped away
Molly McGee gets her tea-leaves read
You'll be married in a month they say
"These leaves are crazy!
Look at this town there's no men left!
Just frail old boys and babies
Talking to teacher in the treble clef"

She plants her garden in the spring
She does the winter shovelling
Tokyo Rose on the radio
She says she's leavin' but she don't go

Out of the blue just passin' thru
A young flight sergeant
On two weeks leave
Says "Molly McGee no one else will do!"
And seals the tea-leaf prophecy
Oh these nights are strong and soft
Private passions and secret storms
Nothin' about him ticks her off
And he looks so cute in his uniform

She plants her garden in the spring
He does the winter shovelling
But summer's just a sneeze
In a long long bad winter cold
She says "I'm leavin' here" but she don't go

"Sleep little darlin'!
This is your happy home
Hiroshima cannot be pardoned!
Don't have kids when you get grown
Because this world is shattered
The wise are mourning
The fools are joking
Oh what does it matter?
The wash needs ironing
And the fire needs stoking"

She plants her garden in the spring
He does the winter shovelling
The three of 'em laughing 'round the radio
She says "I'm leavin' here" but she don't go

She plants her garden in the spring
They do the winter shovelling
They sit up late and watch the
Johnny Carson show
She says "I'm leavin' here but she don't go".

// Dancin' Clown //

No, you couldn't call Jesse a babe in the woods
He's just weak in self-defense
'Cause he's so thin skinned
He can't take a joke at his expense
"You're a push button window," says Rowdy Yates
"I can run you up and down
Anytime I want
I can make you my dancin'
My dancin' clown!"
You're my dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin'
Dancin' clown
Dancin'
You're my dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin' dancin'
Dancin' clown

Rowdy Yates is as bold as Jove
He's all chide and snide and bluff
Stuck in the romantic tradition
Of acting rough and tough
"You're always charging thru," says Jesse
Nervous, lookin' all around
To see who's seein' him bein' a dancin'
A dancin' clown
He's a dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin'
Dancin' clown
Dancin'
He's a dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin' dancin'
Dancin' clown

Cherchez la femme
Whenever love comes around
Someone's a dancin' clown
Cherchez la femme
Whenever hearts start to pound
Someone's a dancin' clown

Down the street comes last-word Suzie
She's high yellow, lookin' top nice
You hear the swoosh of jungle blades
And the crackle of northern ice
"Hot damn!" says Rowdy lookin' up
"Yum!" says Jesse lookin' down
"How would you like to be her dancin'
Her dancin' clown?"
Be her dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin'
Dancin' clown
Dancin'
Be her dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin' dancin'
Dancin' clown

Cherchez la femme
Whenever love comes to town
Someone's a dancin' clown
Cherchez la femme
Wherever hearts start to pound
Someone's a dancin' clown

// Cool Water //

All day I face the barren waste
Without a taste of water
Cool water
Old Dan and I
Our throats slate dry
Our spirits cry out for water
Cool clear water
Keep on movin' Dan
Some devils had a plan
Buried poison in the sand
Don't drink it man
It's in the water
Cool clear water
In my mind I see
A big green tree
And a river flowin' free
Waitin' up ahead
For you and me
Cool clear water

The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star is a pool of water
Cool water
But come the dawn
We carry on
We won't last long without water
Cool clear water
Keep on movin' Dan
We're still in no-man's land
Dry bones and sand
People never planned here for water
Cool clear water
In my mind I see
A big green tree
And a river flowin' free
Waiting up ahead for you and me
Cool clear water

The shadows sway
They seem to say
Tonight we pray for water
Cool water
And way up there
If you care
Please show us where
There's good water
Cool clear water

// The Beat Of Black Wings //

I met a young soldier
He said his name was Killer Kyle
He was shakin' all over
Like a night-frightened child
This is his story
It's a tough one for me to sing
Hard as the squawk and the flap
And the beat of—the beat of black wings

Charley Angel

"They gave me a gun," he said
"They gave me a mission
For the power and the glory
Propaganda piss on 'em
There's a war zone inside me
I can feel things exploding
I can't even hear the fucking music playing
For the beat of the beat of black wings."

Charley Angel

Charley Angel

He said, "I never had nothin'
Nothin' I could believe in
My girl killed our unborn child
Without even grieving
I put my hands on her belly
To feel the kid kickin' damn!
She'd been to some clinic
Oh the beat of black wings."

Charley Angel
Charley Angel
Charley Angel

"They want you they need you
They train you to kill
To be a pin on some map
Some vicarious thrill
The old hate the young
That's the whole heartless thing
The old pick the wars
We die in 'em
To the beat of—the beat of black wings."

Charley Angel
Charley Angel
Charley Angel

"There's a man drawing pictures
On the sidewalk with chalk
Just as fast as he draws 'em
Rain come down and wash 'em off
Keep the drinks comin', girl
'Til I can't feel anything
I'm just a chalk mark in a rainstorm
I'm just the beat of black wings."

// Snakes And Ladders //

He
In a shopping mall
Finally met the perfect girl
She is all that matters
The only one in all the world
Like a Barbie doll
Oh love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

She
Just to have and hold
Is the perfect air-brushed angel
Makes you hot just looking at her
Stapled into all his braincells
Like a centerfold
Oh love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom climb back up
Buy the townhouse
Call the preacher
Get to the bottom climb back up
Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom climb back up
Set up credit for the lovely creature
The lovely creature

He
On a corporate climb
Set his sights on power for her
On a silver platter
He gave up happy hour for her
Perrier and lime
Oh love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders
She
In a handsome world
Put her mind to social graces
All the privileged chatter
Setting pretty table places
For the girls in pearls
Oh love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom climb back up
Buy the carphone
Call the broker
Get to the bottom climb back up
Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom climb back up
Buy the wife a diamond choker
A diamond choker

True love true love true love
He's so nervous
New love new love new love
When he's with her
Oh he's wasting away
True love true love true love
It's so curious
New love new love new love
Just to kiss her
To kiss her to kiss her to kiss her
To kiss her to kiss her to kiss her
To kiss her he has to shave

She
In the gilded mirrors
In the swing of fancy places
Where the black ties flatter
Started seeing other faces
Young fogie financiers
Oh love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

See
In the crimes of time
How the seasons steal away
How the rungs are shattered
First you're green then you're grey
Still the snakes unwind
Still playin' snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom climb back up
Sell the vineyard
Call the lawyer
Get to the bottom climb back up
Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom climb back up
Gather garbage to destroy her
To destroy her

Ladders ladders ladders
The perfect girl
Ladders ladders ladders
The paper chase Love is snakes and ladders
Ladders ladders ladders
The social whirl
Ladders ladders
The rat race
Barbie doll

// The Reoccuring Dream //

This is the reoccurring dream
Born in the dreary gap between
What we have now
And what we wish we could have

More fulfilling and less frustrating!

Out of the envy in our eyes

If you had that house car bottle jar
Your lovers would look like movie stars
Movie stars movie stars movie stars
Order your youth secrets of the stars
Call now just $9.99

Our discontent is their delight
They offer relief for the purchase price
Love in a bottle
Love on four wheels
Is that our new car, Charles?

Isn't it true isn't it true?
We guarantee it. Pick up your phone and dial
See here they sell you

Recognize this?

Isn't there some other way?
Who cares!

// A Bird That Whistles //

I took a house by the water
Took a man on a mountainside
Pretty house by the water
Lovely lover by the waterside
Last time I saw that man
He hung down his head and cried

Corrina, Corrina
Do you have to go
Corrina, Corrina
Tell me why do you have to go
Just made me come to love you girl
Now you pack your things and go
Leave me this bird that whistles
Leave me this bird that sings

I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that's singin'
If I don't have you darlin'
Birds don't mean nothin'
