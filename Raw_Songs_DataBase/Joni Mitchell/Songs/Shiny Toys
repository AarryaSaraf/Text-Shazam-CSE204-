Shiny toys

I'm reading people rags in the checkout lane
Look, here's a hunk here's a honey
Celebrated people and their claims to fame
Here's a boy and his money
And pictures of the winners in the latest
Ratepoll games

Whatever makes you "Yahoo"
Whatever makes your time feel satisfyin'
Whatever makes you
"Oh I am so excited"
Whatever makes you feel like you're right on time

Party night
Good bands all over town
(Good, good, good)
Mega lights and supersonic sounds
(Good, good, good)
Flashy boys and girls that really play
(Good, good, good)
Shiny toys, when it's over don't you hate
To have to put your toys away

Shiny toys
"I love my Porsche"
Shiny toys
Shiny toys
"I love my Porsche"
Shiny toys
Simple joys

Walking on the beach at the end of the day
Between the sand and the seagulls
Watching the glorious sun setting on the bay
Here comes a boy and his beagle
Walking with a man in a toupee
And a man with his head shaved

Whatever makes you "Mmmm, mmmm"
Whatever makes your time feel satisfyin'
Whatever makes you "Mmmmm, mmmm"
Whatever makes you feel like you're right on time

Party night
Super bands all over town
(Good, good, good)
Super lights and supersonic sounds
(Good, good, good)
Flashy boys and girls that really play
(Good, good, good)
Shiny toys, when it's over don't you hate
To have to put your toys away

Shiny toys right on time
Shiny toys right on time
Shiny toys right on time
Shiny toys right on time
