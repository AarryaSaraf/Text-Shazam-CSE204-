Just before our love got lost you said
"I am as constant as a northern star"
And I said, "Constantly in the darkness
Where's that at?
If you want me I'll be in the bar"

On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV-screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
And I sketched your face on it twice

Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
Oh and you taste so bitter but you taste so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you
I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I'd still be on my feet

Oh, I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid

I remember that time that you told me
You said, "Love is touching souls"
Surely you touched mine
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
And you taste so bitter and you taste so sweet
I could drink a case of you
I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I'd still be on my feet

I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said, "Go to him, stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed"

Oh, but you are in my blood
You're my holy wine
Oh, and you taste so bitter but you taste so sweet
I could drink a case of you darling
And still I'd be on my feet
Still I'd be on my feet
