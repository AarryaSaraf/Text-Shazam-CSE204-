Get you a copper kettle
Get you a copper coil
Cover with new-made corn mash
And never more you'll toil

You'll just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-fillin'
In the pale moonlight

Get you a fire of hickory
Get you a fire of oak
Don't use no green or rotten wood
They'll find you by the smoke

While you lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-fillin'
In the pale moonlight

My grandpappy he made whiskey
My daddy he made it too
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792

We just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-fillin'
In the pale moonlight

Get you a copper kettle
Get you a copper coil
Cover with new-made corn mash
And never more you will toil

You'll just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-fillin'
In the pale moonlight
