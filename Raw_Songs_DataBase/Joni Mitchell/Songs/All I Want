I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Traveling, traveling, traveling
Looking for something, what can it be?
Oh I hate you some, I hate you some
I love you some
Oh I love you when I forget about me
I wanna be strong, I wanna laugh along
I wanna belong to the living
Alive, alive, I wanna get up and jive
Wanna wreck my stockings in some jukebox dive
Do you want- do you want-
Do you wanna dance with me baby?
Do you wanna take a chance on
Maybe finding some sweet romance with me baby?
Well come on

All I really, really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you too
All I really, really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you
I wanna talk to you, I wanna shampoo you
I wanna renew you again and again
Applause, applause. Life is our cause
When I think of your kisses
My mind see-saws
Do you see- do you see-
Do you see how you hurt me baby?
So I hurt you too
Then we both get so blue

I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Looking for the key to set me free
Oh the jealousy, the greed is the unraveling
It's the unraveling
And it undoes all the joy that could be
I wanna have fun, I wanna shine like the sun
Wanna be the one that you wanna see
I wanna knit you a sweater
Wanna write you a love letter
Wanna make you feel better
I wanna make you feel free
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm,
Wanna make you feel free
I wanna make you feel free
