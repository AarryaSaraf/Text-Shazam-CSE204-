If I had wings like Noah's dove
I'd fly that river to the one I love
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

I've got a man, and he's long and tall
Moves his body like a cannon ball
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

They gave me a new man to share my bed
Sometimes I wish that I was dead
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

One of these mornings I know he's gonna set me free
There'll be no more auction block for me
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

Yes one of these mornings and it won't be long
Them white bosses gonna find me gone
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well
