Dr. Junk the Dentist Man
Fills your teeth with what he can
Airplane wings and corset stays
And when he's done he'll let you pay
In paper clips or inner tubes
Or anything that's slightly used
He's not really crazy
Only nuts and bolts
And rusty rings make him do
The strangest things

Dr. Junk the Dentist has
An office full of colored glass
A garden with a paddle wheel
And funny plants for eye appeal
And though he watches them with care
I've never seen them growing there
He's not really crazy
Only nuts and bolts
And rusty rings make him do
Eccentric things

Dr. Junk the Dentist built
A junky castle up on stilts
Junk within and junk throughout
And TV in the chimney spout
And fourteen levels to each floor
And now he's adding fourteen more
He's not really crazy
Only nuts and bolts
And rusty rings make him do
The strangest things
