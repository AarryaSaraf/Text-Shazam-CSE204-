At the far end of the midway
by the double ferris wheel
There's a band that plays so snakey
You can't help how you feel
Emmy May ran away
With a man as dark as night
You can see him, if you go there
Second trumpet to the right

They play "Night Train"
So snakey
Black girls dancing
Long and leggy
Barkers barking
Step right up, folks!
The show is about to begin
It's Harlem in Havana time
Step right in!

Silver spangles 
See 'em dangle
In the farm boys' eyes
Hootchie kootchie
Auntie Ruthie would've cried 
If she knew we were on the inside

When Emmy May ran away
She came back a bottle blonde
God! The gossips had a gourmet feast
Chomping on how she went wrong
But miracle of miracles
'Cause we were underage
She got us nearly front row seats
To the right side of the stage

See that tall girl?
That's a man
That one, too 
With the yellow feather fan
Barkers barking
Step right up, folks!
The show is about to begin
It's Harlem in Havana time
Step right in!

Silver spangles 
See 'em dangle
In the farm boys' eyes
Hootchie kootchie
Auntie Ruthie would've died 
If she knew we were on the inside
