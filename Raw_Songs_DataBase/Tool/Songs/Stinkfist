Something has to change.
Un-deniable dilemma.
Boredom's not a burden
Anyone should bear.

Constant over-stimulation numbs me
But I would not want you
Any other way.

Just not enough.
I need more.
Nothing seems to satisfy.
I said
I don't want it.
I just need it.
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.

Finger deep within the borderline.
Show me that you love me and that we belong together.
Relax, turn around and take my hand.

I can help you change
Tired moments into pleasure.
Say the word and we'll be
Well upon our way.

Blend and balance
Pain and comfort
Deep within you
'Til you will not want me any other way.

But it's not enough.
I need more.
Nothing seems to satisfy.
I said
I don't want it.
I just need it.
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.

Knuckle deep inside the borderline.
This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to.
Relax. Slip away.

(Chupa minha pica pichu)
(Chupa minha pica pinto)

(Chupa minha pica pinto)

(Relax, relax, relax, relax)

There's something kinda sad about
The way that things have come to be.
Desensitized to everything.
What became of subtlety?

Now how can this mean anything to me
If I really don't feel anything at all?

I'll keep digging
'Til I feel something.

Elbow deep inside the borderline.
Show me that you love me and that we belong together.
Shoulder deep within the borderline.
Relax. Turn around and take my hand.
