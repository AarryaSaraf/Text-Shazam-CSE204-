// Home Alone //

I'm awake
Can you see me now
And if you stay
We can lounge about
And I'm getting tired
But you make me feel awake
And at the end of the night
Maybe we can stay up late

'Cause I'm just all alone
Sitting at home
And you should stay
If you don't mind
I'll be okay
If you stay
'Cause you should stay
If you don't mind

On my own
I miss you here
Sun is gone
And the clouds are near
And I'm getting tired of being
By myself
'Cause at the end of the night
Maybe you can help yourself

'Cause I'm just all alone
Sitting at home
And you should stay
If you don't mind
I'll be okay
If you stay
'Cause you should stay
If you don't mind

I'm just all alone
Sitting at home
And you should stay
If you don't mind
I'll be okay
If you stay
'Cause you should stay
If you don't mind

// Bobby //

Bobby was fourteen when she knew
Nothing would last
Wishing her life wouldn't be this bad
'Cause Bobby always thought like this with her thought of having missed
Every little thing life could bring she dismissed
'Cause Bobby always saw the bad onto the life she had
Who could have blamed the girl
Bobby was fourteen years old, Bobby was fourteen years old

Bobby was fourteen when she knew
Nothing would last
Wishing her mind didn't think so sad
'Cause Bobby always had a stitch on the left side of her wrist
Despite the love she'd get she dismissed
'Cause Bobby always saw the bad onto the life she had
Who could have blamed the girl
Bobby was fourteen years old, Bobby was fourteen years old

And Bobby knew if she'd ended it all it would be better soon
And if she tried, she would've missed out being happy and be a fool
But deep down bobby knew she'd find someone like you

Bobby was fifteen when she knew
Something's would last
Wishing her mind never thought that bad
'Cause bobby still had the stitch on the left side of her wrist
She got all life could give that she'd missed

// Spacing Out //

Can't you see
Can't you notice
Somehow tough and I'm pretty broken
Just because I'm fine doesnt mean I'm alright
And I need someone to say okay
I need someone to say It's fine

I'm just stressing out
I need something to hold me
I need something to hold me
I'm just spacing out
I need something to catch me
I need something to catch me

Are you dumb are you stupid
Is it me or is it pretty obvious
Just because I don't talk doesn't mean I go talking
'Cause sometimes I keep to myself
And sometimes it's helps with my friend

I'm just stressing out
I need something to hold me
I need something to hold me
I'm just spacing out
I need something to catch me
I need something to catch me
I'm just stressing out
I need something to hold me
I need something to hold me

// Angry Song //

Pick up the phone
Please, tell me you're home
The monsters are gone
The wardrobe is closed
Where's my guitar
They hate when I sing
So, fuck my guitar, yeah
Fuck everything

Mmmm mmmm [x2]

String's on a twist
My ass they can kiss
They're making me sick
Just, go suck my dick
No, singing past ten
You can't stay in your bed
So, fuck mom and dad
I'm going real mad

Mmmm mmmm [x4]
