Please don't make me hide
I've been putting up a fight
What's the use of it now?
When I get pulled down
Anyways I've been hiding my expressions
You can't blame the reflections
And the ripples on the ground
I might as well have drowned

So I'm keeping busy
Work twice as hard as you
Want you to believe me
That I can pick and choose
You said you'd let me drive your car
As long as I'm with you
Then you'd wait till we'd get far
To tell me that you'll be gone soon

Feels too late right now
I've been holding back
'Cause I'm afraid that I'm too loud
Six feet underground
I feel alone again
Stuck between the friends
I guess I'll figure my way through them
Not sure how I'd do it
But I'm sure now the people will listen
As the water glistens and I see my reflection
So much clearer

So I'm keeping busy
Work twice as hard as you
Want you to believe me
That I can pick and choose
You said you'd let me drive your car
As long as I'm with you
Then you'd wait till we'd get far
And tell me that you'll be gone soon
