Catch the rain
Even on a sunny day
I swear I'm not excusing
I'll cross my heart to prove it
But she seems tired 'cause we've been through this

And I know you said that we're not a thing
But you're here that's the thing
And I'm not trying to give you a ring
Well maybe on the phone if you let it sing
You're overcomplicating everything
When the lights go down don't say I didn't warn ya
I don't think that's legal in the state of California

I've got you wrapped around my finger
Like a piece of ribbon
You just won't admit it that you're smitten
Hold on a minute please won't you listen
'Cause I'm not sure if you're into
Me like I'm into you
I said a lot of stupid things in the winter
Once the ice got thinner
But somehow we managed through the fall
So I guess it's not that bad at all

That we're not a thing
But you're here that's the thing
And I'm not trying to give you a ring
Well maybe on the phone if you let it sing
You're overcomplicating everything
When the lights go down don't say I didn't warn ya
I don't think that's legal in the state of California

I'm going away
Did I forget to mention how long I'd stay
Is that a question for another day
But while we're away

And I know you said that we're not a thing
But you're here that's the thing
And I'm not trying to give you a ring
Well maybe on the phone if you let it sing
You're overcomplicating everything
When the lights go down don't say I didn't warn ya
I don't think that's legal in the state of California
