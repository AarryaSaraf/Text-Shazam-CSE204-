I paint a picture on my wall the other night again
I have a feeling that I'm losing all my oldest friends
Spend a week inside I'm tired and I think they know
Way to go
Saw a spider living in my room the other day
I asked politely if I didn't mind I thought he'd stayed
A crow is on the roof, he peers inside, I think he knows
Then he goes

I can't pretend when I'm with my closest friends
'Cause Tinkerbell is super overrated

I started smoking in the mornings and stay in bed
I'm not a woman in my room I'm just a girl instead
I think the bug I saw that bit you he had always known
Way to go

By the way
I came to tell you
My hairs turned grey
And I think I grew
I'm afraid of lying in my room
I stay awake and it sees the truth

I can't pretend when I'm with my closest friends
'Cause Tinkerbell is super overrated

I was around on Sunday night
I wish I was at home where I feel nice
Now that I lay here in my bed
I wish that I went to meet you out instead

The sky looks all red
It's fine
The rose that I had planted yesterday died
It's fine
I lost the book that I read
It's mine
And when I leave my house I will regret it 'cause I

By the way
I came to tell you
My hairs turned grey
And I think I grew
I'm afraid of lying in my room
I stay awake and it sees the truth

I can't pretend when I'm with my closest friends
'Cause Tinkerbell is super overrated
