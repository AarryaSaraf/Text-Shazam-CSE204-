Can't you see
Can't you notice
Somehow tough and I'm pretty broken
Just because I'm fine doesnt mean I'm alright
And I need someone to say okay
I need someone to say It's fine

I'm just stressing out
I need something to hold me
I need something to hold me
I'm just spacing out
I need something to catch me
I need something to catch me

Are you dumb are you stupid
Is it me or is it pretty obvious
Just because I don't talk doesn't mean I go talking
'Cause sometimes I keep to myself
And sometimes it's helps with my friend

I'm just stressing out
I need something to hold me
I need something to hold me
I'm just spacing out
I need something to catch me
I need something to catch me
I'm just stressing out
I need something to hold me
I need something to hold me
