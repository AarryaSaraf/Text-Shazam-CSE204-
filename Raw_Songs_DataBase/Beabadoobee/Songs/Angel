White angel come
Intoxicate my blood
Just another hit
You'd get used to it
Just another grit

Your bones are only painted gold
That's why it rots beneath your soul
You're not as brave as you may seem
That's why it hurts me

I'm scared of life
It's in my blood
So I blame myself
I blame myself
I blame myself
White pretty snowflakes
White pretty snowflakes
White pretty snowflakes
Falling on my face

Your bones are only painted gold
That's why it rots beneath your soul
You're not as brave as you may seem
That's why it hurts me
