Your eyes are just like his but your face is a bit different
You're a bit more fucked but I guess that's fine
Maybe, that's what I want this time

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

This is too bad to boast
But this is my way to float
And if I shut up I'm scared I'll drown
But maybe that's the best for now

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

Don't think this is worth it
Don't think this is worth it
I'm not wasting time
But you've been on my mind
Don't think this is worth it
This time

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying
