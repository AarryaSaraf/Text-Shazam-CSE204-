You lie all the time
Yeah you do
But I can't complain
'Cause I'm just afraid of losing you

You don't understand
Yeah you don't
'Cause if I explained
You'd just hate the way it goes

So tell me it's okay
That everything is great
'Cause I just hate the fact
That every time we do
You look the other way

You say it's alright
Yeah you do
But it's fine
'Cause you hate to see me cry
Cry
Cry

So tell me it's okay
That everything is great
'Cause I just hate the fact
That every time we do
You look the other way

And if you ask me
What I'd wanna do
I'd look you in the eyes
And end up asking you (oh)
You (oh)
Oh you
Oh you
