You ought to know that
I think we're one and the same
I don't think we could help it
No, I don't think we could help it

We don't talk much
I guess 'cause nothing has changed
I'm not sure I like it
And I'm so tired of fighting

If I told you, you know how to go and break my heart in two
'Cause I will anyways
We'd end up like always
You know me, you better show me that you can say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same
There's worse things I can take

I know you hate it
When there's nothing to say
I'm not quite sure we'd fix it
I guess we're so used to it

Wish I had noticed from the beginning
I find it hard to work out
Why we have all this now?

If I told you you know how to go and break my heart in two
'Cause I will anyways
We'd end up like always
You know me, you better show me that you can say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same
There's worse things I can take
