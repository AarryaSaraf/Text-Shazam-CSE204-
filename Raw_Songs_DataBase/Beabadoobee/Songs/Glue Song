I've never known someone like you
Tangled in love, stuck by you
From the glue
Don't forget to kiss me
Or else you'll have to miss me
I guess I'm stuck forever by the glue
Oh, and you

Finding the right words
To use for this song
I have you in mind
So it won't take so long
Never thought I'd find you
But you're here
And so I love you

I'm not wrong
When I say I've been stuck
By the glue onto you
I've been stuck by glue
Right onto you
I've been stuck by glue

I've never known
I've never known someone like you
I've never known
I've never known someone like you
