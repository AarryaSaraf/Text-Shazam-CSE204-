Hold me close and say you care
Because I'm in love with your brown hair
The way you touch me is a curse
And I'm not willing to let it hurt

Watch your mouth and wash with soap
Because I just hate the way you spoke
Green eyes make everything feel numb
So I'm not willing to give it all up

And I'm not wasting time again
Closure instead of sex
I'm not wasting time again

You said I fucked up and ruined your life
Little did you know you ruined
Mine
