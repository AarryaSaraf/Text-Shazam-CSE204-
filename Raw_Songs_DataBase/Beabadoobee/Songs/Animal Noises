I'm still afraid of the dark
But mornings are scarier
'Cause when I'm awake, I spend half of my day
Wondering what to do
I'll miss the 9 a.m train
'Cause I slept through my alarm again
Forgetting to eat is affecting my sleep
But I guess that's just part of the trend

I miss the mornings I spent making animal noises with you
I just need someone to hold but I guess that I'm getting too old
It's something I keep getting told
I guess that I'm getting too old for this

Well, I guess that I've made some mistakes
And you know that I've told a few lies
If I call in the morning, I know you'd be boring
And say my behavior's alright
Maybe you like my mistakes
And maybe I get what I like
Maybe the things that made you wanna live
Were the things that made me wanna die

I miss the mornings I spent making animal noises with you
I just need someone to hold but I guess that I'm getting too old
It's something I keep getting told
I guess that I'm getting too old for this

For this
I'm too old for this
For this
Ah, ah, ah

I miss the mornings I spent making animal noises with you
I just need someone to hold but I guess that I'm getting too old
It's something I keep getting told
I guess that I'm getting too old for this
