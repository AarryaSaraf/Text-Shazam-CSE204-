You are the smell of pavement after the rain
You are the last empty seat on a train
And I'm convinced you're from outer space

And I want you to know that I'm in love
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

You are the song that I need for my mental state
You are the bus that stayed when I thought I was late
So I'm convinced you're from outer space

And I want you to know that I'm in love
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

Eyes so green, I don't know what that means
But you make me feel like all this is real
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

And I want you to know that I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love

And I want to keep you quiet
And I know you feel the same
And I'm sorry I'm gone so often
But I know you'd do the same
The same
The same

I want you to know that I'm in love
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

Eyes so green, I don't know what that means
But you make me feel like all this is real
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

And I want you to know that I'm in love
