Back on old habits
That no one knows about
Too bad that Charlie Brown
Has inked you up to slow you down
Has inked you up to slow you down

Throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it away

I call you if I need you
Give my brain a sec
I just need to figure things out
Figure things out

Throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it away

If I could die here a million times
Then what's the point of trying?

Throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it away
