Back on old ways, I know your face
I haven't seen you in some days
It hurts my head, my conscience dead
The fact I miss the way it felt

You're coming back again
Don't want you back again

You call me up and lie again
Like all the men I use to trust
Nobody knows when I was young
I lost my self in cosmic dust

You're coming back again
Don't want you back again

Just the thought of you doesn't stop
You're not a person or a thing
Just the thought of you on my limbs
It's all your fault
It's all your fault
It's all your fault
It's all your fault
