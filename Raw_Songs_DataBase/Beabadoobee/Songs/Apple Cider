We both like apple cider
But your hair be smelling like fruit punch
And I don't even like you that much
Wait
I do
FUCK

Call me
At midnight
Let's give this
Thing a try

You said you liked my hair
So go ahead and touch it
You said you liked the jumper I wore
So I always wore it
It's really nice to talk to you
It's really nice to hold your hand
It's really nice to talk to you
It's really nice to hold your hand
And even if we're just friends
We could be more than that
And even if we're just friends
We could be more than that

So call me
At midnight
Let's give this thing
A try

Call me
At midnight
Let's give this thing
A try

So call me
At midnight
Ask if it's alright
To have a sleepover
To drink some apple cider
Or maybe some fruit punch
And we can talk about how we don't like each other that much
