I wanted to be everything you see
But I went the wrong direction
I needed some affection
And I'm not sure why but
I will see you soon
(I guess I have to take it, I'm deteriorating)
Feeling blue

It's a walk in the park
You said, "It's not that hard"
I'm feeling kinda dizzy
I don't want this to leave me
And I told you, I'll

See you soon
(I guess I have to take it, I'm deteriorating)
Feeling blue
(I try to have a meaning and it looks appealing)
I want you

I had some time away
Didn't want to go insane from this
I wanted you to know
I need time to grow and to exist
I think I needed space
Let you know I'm safe
I swear it's just a little thing

See you soon
(I guess I have to take it, I'm deteriorating)
Feeling blue
(I try to have a meaning and it looks appealing)
I want you
