It's been a while since I've talked about it
Maybe it's time to co-operate
I need some help to forget about it
I don't want your sympathy
Stop saying you give a shit
Because you don't really care
Care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah

It's been a while since I've thought about it
Maybe it's time to communicate
I was seven to think about it
The fact I still can't forget about it
I don't want your sympathy
I guess I've had it rough
But you don't really care
Care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah

Oh, by the way I'm still the same
I'm still the same
But are you the same?
Oh, by the way I'm still the same
I'm still the same
But are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Forget about it

I don't want your sympathy
I guess I've had it rough
But you don't really care
Care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah

Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Oh-oh, oh-oh
You, you-ou

Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you?
