I didn't think I'd ever want this yet
When we had first met in fall
Guess it's something you learn to accept
When I've been a mess it's not your fault
But I keep forgetting it's what we do

I missed the train again
I called your name
As if you'd drive it back
I swear you're in my head
Throughout the day
I can say that for a fact
Know we had better days
But to keep me sane
I guess that this is just another love song
About you
Just another love song
About you

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do

I'm running over sentences at times
I'd better quit dreaming just so I could write
Yet the words to describe you aren't so hard to find
Like a good quote from a book that I've memorised
But I keep forgetting just what to do

I missed the train again
I called your name
As if you'd drive it back
I swear you're in my head
Throughout the day
I can say that for a fact
Know we had better days
But to keep me sane
I guess that this is just another love song
About you
Just another love song
About you

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do
