Sad I had to see you
But I don't and I won't and I won't
To think I was just like you
All alone skin to bone, skin to bone

And it hurts me
That you could be the one that deserved this
Even more
That you stayed in the same dark place that I adore
But you stayed for more
I guess that's what happens to the best of us
The best of us

I hope to come and see you
When your state's doing great, doing great
A part of me feels for you
That I'm doing alright and guess I've been feeling fine

But it hurts me
That you could be the one that deserved this
Even more
That you stayed in the same dark place that I adore
But you stayed for more
I guess that's what happens to the best of us
The best of us

I never want to think twice
With what could have been your life

And I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

And it hurts me
That you could be the one that deserved this
Even more
That you stayed in the same dark place that I adore
But you stayed for more
I guess that's what happens to the best of us
The best of us

And I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
