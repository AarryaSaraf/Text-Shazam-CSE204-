Hey, won't you call me back?
'Cause I've been waiting for a text back
It hurts my brain
This chick who plays bass

She plays bass, she plays bass
Nothing matters 'cause we're both in space
Pretty shit we could never date
She plays bass, she plays bass

Guess we're both stuck in the same boat
The world doesn't seem to get us though
You're just stuck in space
Just playing your bass

She plays bass, she plays bass
Nothing matters 'cause we're both in space
Pretty shit we could never date
She plays bass, she plays bass

She plays bass, she plays bass
Nothing matters 'cause we're both in space
How I wish we could just date
So you could teach me how to be more like you

Wish I was more like you
Wish I was more like you
Wish I was more like you
