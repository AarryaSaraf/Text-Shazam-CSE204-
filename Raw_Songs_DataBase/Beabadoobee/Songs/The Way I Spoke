Think I saw you on the bus just yesterday
Wearing that blue shirt you said you liked that day
The image now is just blurred in my mind

But do you recall the time we talked?
The day you held my hand?
We were by a station
The sky was dark in sight
The moon was out but the sun was in your eyes
No one talked but I did
You listened
You said you liked the way I spoke

I think I saw you in my dream last night
It was cold with lots of pretty lights
The image now is just blurred in my mind

But do you recall the time we talked?
The day you kissed me?
We were by an archway
With flowers cascading round the roof
Standing under my winter coat to shelter us
You said you liked the way I spoke

And if you'd like to hold my hand
It would bring back all the things we had
And if God were to take that all away
Wouldn't that be a shame?
