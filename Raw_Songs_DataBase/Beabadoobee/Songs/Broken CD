Don't think I'm over it
It hurt when I was seventeen
Flew by so quickly, I
Could hardly breathe

Don't think I'm over it
Like I always said I was
Like a broken CD
That plays on repeat

Don't think I'm over it
It hurt when I was seventeen
Flew by so quickly, I
Could hardly breathe

Don't think I'm over it
Like I always said I was
Like a broken CD
That plays on repeat
