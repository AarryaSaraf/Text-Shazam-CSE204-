There was a time when I was broken
Didn't know which way to turn
I was paralyzed, wondering why
Hanging on to hope, 
My faith was failing me

But I heard a voice deep down inside
Saying, "Isnpite of the mess that you made
Don't you know I suffered so you wouldn't have to"
That's when I dropped to my knees and I prayed

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound


Right then, right there in that moment (lovestruck)
Lovestruck my soul to the core (whoa)
And like blood through my veins
It rushed in and saved me
That's why I'm so thankful for

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound

I once was lost
But now I'm found
Was blind but now
I see

When we've been with Him
For ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We'll have no 
Just sing God's praise
And 

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound

I once was lost
But now I'm found
Was blind but now
I see

I was lost
I was 
I was down
I was out
I was sad
I was lost
I was sad
Feeling down
Now I know
Who He is
And I know
He can take me all through
Whatever life brings my way

He hasn't failed me
He's never failed me
I wanna tell ya
If you're a Godly person
He's your Savior
He helped
Through all my trials
Through all tribulations
He showed me
How to get through
All the bad times in my life
