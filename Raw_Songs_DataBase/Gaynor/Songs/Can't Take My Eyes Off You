You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I want to hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The thought of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Then let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

I love you baby and if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say
I love you baby, don't let me down I pray
I love you baby, now that I've found you stay
And let me love you baby, let me love you

You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I want to hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

I love you baby and if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say
I love you baby, don't let me down I pray
I love you baby, now that I've found you stay
And let me love you baby, let me love you

I love you baby and if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say

I love you baby and if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say
