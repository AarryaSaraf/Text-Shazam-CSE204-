Here we are, alone again
In your arms again, and keeps on getting better
Well I don't need to read your mind
'Cause baby in your eyes, I can almost see forever

But before you go too far, before I fall too fast
Baby you should know, I need love that's gonna last
You gotta promise to be here
Through the laughter and the tears
Let me know that you're mine
Everyday, every night... 'cause

There's just no other way to love me
Take my heart, take my soul
Baby never let me go
No, there's just no other way to love me
That's the way it should be
If you gonna fall in love with me
'Cause there's just no other way to love me

Let me show you how much I care
And baby I swear, I'll be right there when you need me
But I gotta know that you'll always be true (always be true)
That you're gonna see this through
And give your heart completely

I wanna feel it when we kiss, believe when we touch
Babydon't just say you love me, 'cause words are not enough
I wanna see it in your eyes, believe it deep inside
I gotta know you'll be here
Everyday, every night ('cause)

There's just no other way to love me
Take my heart, take my soul
Baby never let me go
No, there's just no other way to love me
That's the way it should be
If you gonna fall in love with me
'Cause there's just no other way to love me

I will never ask for more than I'll give to you
(Gonna give me everything)
I wanna give him my everything
But I gotta know that my heart is true
Every day (every day)
Every night (every night)
For the rest of my life... 'cause
Commitment baby that's what I need
A heart that belongs only to me

I wanna feel it when we kiss, believe when we touch
Babydon't just say you love me, 'cause words are not enough
I wanna see it in your eyes, believe it deep inside
I gotta know you'll be here
Everyday, every night ('cause)

'Cause there's just no other way to love me
Just no other way to love me

There's just no other way to love me
Take my heart, take my soul
Baby never let me go
No, there's just no other way to love me
That's the way it should be
If you gonna fall in love with me
'Cause there's just no other way to love me
