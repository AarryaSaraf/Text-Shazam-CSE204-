Let me tell you 'bout that jive type 
That jive type 
Casanova Brown 

I met him at a party 
He said the sweetest things when he hit on me 
Wrapped up in his arms 
I was blinded by his charm and I couldn't see 

Like the story of little red riding hood 
The big bad wolf was up to 
Up to no good, woo, no 

That jive type, that jive type 
Casanova Brown 
He hit on me and he'll hit on you 
That jive type, that jive type 
Casanova Brown 

I was lonely and naive 
I guess that's why I believed every word he says 
It felt so good to hear 
Every time he said he cared it went straight to my head 

He loved me and left me 
But I can't deny 
His love was so doggone good 
I still, I still love that guy, ooh, oh no hey 

That jive type, that jive type 
Casanova Brown 
He hit on me and he'll hit on you, watch out 
That jive type, that jive type, ooh 
Casanova Brown 
Let me tell you 'bout that jive type 
that jive type 
Casanova Brown 
That jive type, that jive type, 
Casanova Brown 

I was sittin' there mindin' my business 
Feelin' good, checkin' things out 
Sippin' on little wine jive type, that jive type
Then I spotted 
Super cool dude cross the room diggin' on me 
I tried to pretend like I didn't even see him 
But he was so fine 
He took my hand and started to dancin' 
I know he felt me fallin' for him 
'Cause he kept holdin' me tighter and tighter, ooh 
Sure was nice 
Girl, my head was all turned around, oh 
I didn't know what I was gettin' into, ooh, ow 

Up to no good, oh no 

That jive type, that jive type 
Casanova Brown 
That jive type, that jive type 
Casanova Brown 

Like the story of little red riding hood 
The big bad wolf was up to 
Up to no good, woo, oh 

That jive type, that jive type 
Casanova Brown 
That jive type, that jive type 
Casanova Brown 
That jive type, that jive type 
Casanova Brown
