You tell me that you feel so broken
Tell me that you're all used up
Looking for a little salvation
Just a drop in a empty cup
Mm, I remember that song
Used to be the soundtrack of my life
But God's giving me a whole new melody
Telling me it's going to be alright

I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
And when I just can't see at all
He's still singing over me
I sing cause I'm forgiven (Oh, yeah)
I sing cause I'm redeemed (Redeemed)
And when I just can't sing at all
He's still singing over me (Yes, he is)
Singing over me (Over me), singing over me

I used to think that everything was hopeless
Used to think that I was on my own
'Til the God of all creation
Made my heart his home, and now I sing

I sing because I'm happy (Yeah)
I sing because I'm free (Oh, I'm free)
And when I just can't sing at all
He's still singing over me
I sing 'cause I'm forgiven
I sing 'cause I'm redeemed
And when I just can't sing at all
He's still singing

(Ain't no sorrow), ain't no sorrow (No, no)
(Ain't no sin) Ain't no sin
There's no broken that he can't mend (I like this)
(Ain't no worry) I'm telling you, ain't no worry (No worry)
(Ain't no shame) Ain't no shame (No shame)
There's no condemnation in his name

So I sing because I'm happy (Oh, yeah)
And I sing because I'm free
So won't' you sing with me? (Yeah)
I sing because I'm happy (I'm happy)
I sing because I'm free (Oh, I'm free)
And when I just can't sing at all (Yeah)
He's still singing over me (Oh, oh)
I sing because I'm forgiven (Forgiven)
I sing cause I'm redeemed (I'm redeemed)
And when I just can't sing at all (Yeah)
He's still singing over me (Over, yeah)
Singing over me (Over me), yeah, yeah
Singing over me (Over me now, yeah, yeah)
He's still singing over me (Oh, he's still singing)
Singing over me (Yeah, he's still singing)
Singing over me (Aw, yeah)
He's singing, he's singing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mhm
