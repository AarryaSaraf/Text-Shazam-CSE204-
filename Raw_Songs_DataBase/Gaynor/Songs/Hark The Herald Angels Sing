Hark the herald, angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

Joyful, all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With the angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark the herald, angels sing
Glory to the newborn King

Hail the heav'n-born Prince of peace
Hail the Son of righteousness
Light and life to all He brings
Ris'n with healing in His wings

Mild He lays His glory by
Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth
Hark the herald, angels sing
Glory to the newborn King

Hark the herald, angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

Joyful, all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With the angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
