We started out with a new love 
And we thought we had more control 
And as it turned to an old love 
Bad times started to unfold 

Now I don't want to let you go 
And I don't want it to ever end 
So if feelings have been torn and if hearts have been broken 
Let's put it back together again 
Ooh, we've got to 

Let's mend what's been broken 
You and me, me and you 
Let's mend what's been broken 
Ooh, yeah 

Now I'm not ready for new love 
'Cause you make my life so complete 
And if there's any problem 
I know we won't suffer deeply 

'Cause I don't want to let you go 
I don't want it to ever end 
So if feelings have been torn and if hearts have been broken 
Let's put it back together again 
Uh-huh, we've got to 

Let's mend what's been broken 
Me and you, you and me 
Let's mend what's been broken 
Ooh, yeah 

Don't throw it all away 
Let's keep this love in every way 
Mend my heart, my achin' heart 
The thought of a brand new start tears me all apart 

The love we've got, don't let it end 
We can put it back together again 
(And let's do it) 
(Let's do it) 

Let's mend what's been broken (Let's get to it) 
Let's mend what's been broken (Let's get to it) 

(Let's do it) 
(Let's do it) 
(Let's do it) 
(Let's do it) 
(Let's do it) 
(Let's get to it) 

Let's mend what's been broken (Let's get to it) 
You and me 
Let's mend what's been broken (Let's get to it) 
I know our love has got to be
