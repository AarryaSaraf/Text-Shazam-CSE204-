You may be down and feeling low
Tossed by the wind, wherever it may blow
You're just confused and filled with doubt
Lost in the dark, and you can't see no way out

There is a mountain for you to run to
Where there's a rock that will shelter you
There is a man, that you should know
Stretch out His hand to pull you close

And if you'll hold on, He won't let go
He won't let go
If you'll just hold on, He won't let go
He won't let go

There is a voice, you should listen to
There is a choice for what you ought to do
The only step that you need to take
To the side and let Him lead the way

He knows your heart, and He feels your pain
He knows your scars, every one by name
He knows your flaws and he knows your fears
He'll bring you joy to replace your tears

And if you'll hold on
He won't let go, He won't let go
If you'll just hold on, He won't let go
He won't let go

Take a look at me, I'm living proof
Trust and believe, He'll do the same for you
It's nothing we can earn, it just takes a little faith
It's nothing we deserve, it's just His amazing grace

And if you'll hold on, He won't let go, He won't let go
If you'll just hold on, He won't let go, He won't let go
If you'll just hold on, hold on, He won't let go, He won't let go
If you'll just hold on, hold on, He won't let go, He won't let go

He won't let go
Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, He won't let go...
Just put your hand in the hand, in the hand of the Man with the master plan
And He won't let go, He won't let go
He won't let go...
