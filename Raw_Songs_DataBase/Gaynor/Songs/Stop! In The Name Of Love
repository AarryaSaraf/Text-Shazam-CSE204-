Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart

Baby, baby, I'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love, you'll meet

But this time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt
(Think it over)
After I've been good to you
(Think it over)
After I've been sweet to you

Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over, think it over

I've known of your, your secluded nights
I've even seen her maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?

But this time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
(Think it over)
Haven't I been good to you?
(Think it over)
Haven't I been sweet to you?

Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over, think it over

I've tried so hard, hard to be patient
Hoping you'd stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid, I'll be losing you forever

Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart

Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Baby, think it over
Think it over, baby

Ooh, think it over baby
