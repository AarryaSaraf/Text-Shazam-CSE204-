Stoplight
Stoplight
Hold it right there
Don't proceed unless you care
Stoplight
Only turns green
When my heart is sure you won't treat it mean

Just gettin' over a hit and run
And let me tell ya, it ain't no fun
I couldn't give you the right of way
Till I believe every word you say

I took a ride for too much lyin'
Spun my wheels and left me cryin'
So understand, it's love I'm heedin'

I've had my fill of speedin'
It's a case of live and learn
Read all signs before you turn
Love came in and left so fast
It shook me up
A classic case of whiplash

Stoplight
Stoplight
Hold it right there
Don't proceed unless you care
Stoplight
Only turns green
When my heart is sure you won't treat it mean

You've so good lookin' you drive me wild
But I've been over some rugged miles
I'd like to go where you have in mind
But I'd be crossin' the yellow line

And so I'll pass with just a kiss
Conditions say no more than this
The lane of love, it's fast and wicked
What's really cold, it gets no ticket

I've had my fill of speedin'
It's a case of live and learn
Read all signs before you turn
Love came in and left so fast
It shook me up
A classic case of whiplash

Stoplight
Stoplight
Hold it right there
Don't proceed unless you care
Stoplight
Only turns green
When my heart is sure you won't treat it mean

And if your love is really true
I'll give my everything to you
Till then I'm flashin' you a

Stoplight
Stoplight
Hold it right there
Don't proceed unless you care
Stoplight
Only turns green
When my heart is sure you won't treat it mean
