I've got so many burdens on my heart
Questions weighing on my mind
I've grown so tired of all this madness
Wishin' I could leave it all behind
Even now, fear and doubt
Keep tryin' to drag me down, take me out
So hard to hear your voice in all this crazy noise

Take me back to day one
Where you drenched my heart in the water
And I felt love for the first time
Breathe life into these weary lungs
And take me back, oh take me back to day one

All my hope should be found in You
Not the socials or the daily news
They don't have the truth I need
Only You can set me free, so...

Take me back to day one
Where you drenched my heart in the water
And I felt love for the first time
Breathe life into these weary lungs
And take me back, Lord, take me back to day one

Back to love, joy, peace and happiness
Where you gave this wayward child a second chance
'Cause where my soul finds comfort, I find rest, oh oh

Take me back to day one
Where you drenched my heart in the water
And I felt love for the first time
Breathe life into these weary lungs
And take me back, Lord, take me back
Take me back, oh take me back to day one
To day one
