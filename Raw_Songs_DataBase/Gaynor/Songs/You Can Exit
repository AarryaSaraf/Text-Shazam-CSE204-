You've been giving indications that you're leaving
And I'd wish that you'd admit it right away
Help me understand the pattern you've been weaving
Is it only out of habit that you stay

Lay it on the line hun
To waste each other's time is such a crime
If you don't like the size, if you don't like the fit
You can split
You can quit
You can exit anytime
You can exit anytime

I can feel the good going in your kissing
I can see the sign of cheating in your eyes
Could it be another girl you might be missing?
Do I have to try to see through some disguise?

Lay it on the line, hun
To waste each other's time is such a crime
If you don't like the size, if you don't like the fit
You can split
You can quit
You can exit anytime
You can exit anytime

When we met we thought we'd write love's perfect story
And then we'd dream we'd be together until the end
If you want we can revive that flame and glory
Is this really love or just pretend

Lay it on the line, hun
To waste each other's time is such a crime
If you don't like the size, if you don't like the fit
You can split
You can quit
Ha - you can exit anytime
Ha - you can exit anytime

Honey there's just no reason to keep playing this cruel heart breaking game
If you feel like moving on just say something, you know I just might feel the same
I know your find, but so am I
If you don't like the signs
If you don't like the feel
You can exit anytime
