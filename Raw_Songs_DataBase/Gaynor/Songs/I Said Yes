Wowow, hahahaha, yeheyehe

He was bad, he was clean
Dressed to kill that is wrapped on me
I can't kill
Coz that's all I understand
Wowow

You were gone, left me blue
We both know how long we've been through
What Am I
Convenient love for you
Wow

Yes, no
It hurts me so
Heart is weak
But mind is go
Do your dance
What is life without sweet romance

I took a chance and I said yes
At time when I needed love
I open my heart, let it all in
I live the dream hey
I love the one, the one

I said yes
Where it goes?
Honey no one knows
Now I'm free
To finally meet
True happiness
So I confess
I said yes

Must confess
He'd say yes
I said Y-E-S
Wowow

With my heels
Have some fun
Dance and dance
Till the morning sun
You're so good
When love goes like it should

Watch me by
Dance that high
Far away from the tears
I've cried
Tears that cruel
We live in an awful groove
I made a move

I said yes
And at time when I needed love
I open my heart
Let it all in
I live the dream hey
I love the one, the one

I said yes
Where it goes?
Honey no one knows
Now I'm free
To finally meet
True happiness
And so I confess
I said yes

He'd say yes (He'd say yes)
I said yes
Oh, I said Y-E-S
I took a chance
And I said yes
And at time when I needed love
I open my heart
Let it all in
I live the dream hey
I love the one, the one

I said yes
Oh oh I said yes
And at time when I needed love
I open my heart
Let it all in
I live the dream hey
I love the one, the one
I said yes
