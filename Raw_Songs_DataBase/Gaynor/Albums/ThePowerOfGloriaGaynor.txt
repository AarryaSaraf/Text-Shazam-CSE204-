// The Eye Of The Tiger //

Risin' up back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive
So many times, it happens too fast
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
You must fight just to keep them alive

[Chorus:]
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all
With the eye of the tiger

Face to face, out in the heat
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
They stack the odds till' we take to the street
For we kill with the skill to survive

[Chorus]

Risin' up straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive

It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor
Stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all
With the eye of the tiger

The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger
The eye of the tiger

// The Heat Is On //

The heat is on, on the street
Inside your head, on every beat
And the beat's so loud, deep inside
The pressure's high, just to stay alive
'Cause the heat is on

Oh woo oh ho, oh woo oh ho
Caught up in the action I've been looking out for you
Oh woo oh ho, oh woo oh ho
Tell me can you feel it? Tell me can you feel it?
Tell me can you feel it?

The heat is on, the heat is on
The heat is on, it's on the street
The heat is on

Oh woo oh ho, oh woo oh ho
Caught up in the action I've been looking out for you
Oh woo oh ho, oh woo oh ho
Tell me can you feel it? Tell me can you feel it?
Tell me can you feel it?

The heat is on, the heat is on
The heat is on, it's on the street
The heat is on

The shadows are on the darker side
Behind those doors, it's a wilder ride
You can make a break, you can win or lose
That's a chance you take when the heat's on you
When the heat is on

Oh woo oh ho, oh woo oh ho
Caught up in the action I've been looking out for you
Oh woo oh ho, oh woo oh ho
Tell me can you feel it? Tell me can you feel it?
Tell me can you feel it?

The heat is on, the heat is on
The heat is on, it's on the street
The heat is on, the heat is on
The heat is on, it's on the street
The heat is on, the heat is on

// Feel So Real //

Feel, feel, feel

Feel so real
I feel so real
I feel so real
And I owe it all to you

Oh, I feel so nice
With you here by my side
If I just do the best that I can do
It seems that's enough for you

The little things mean so much
A smile or a joyful touch
That push that keeps me going strong
To know that I belong

And I feel so real
I feel so real
I feel so real
And I owe it all to you

Hey, feel so real
I feel so real
Oh, I feel so real
And I owe it all to you

Love is such a wonderful thing
The angels sing when freedom reigns
Freedom from the chains
That hold us back from harmony

I'm right here on my knees
To thank you for the air that I breath
I thank you for the life that you have saved
That's why I've got to say

Feel so real
I feel so real
Oh, I feel so real
And I owe it all to you, you

Hey, feel so real
I feel so real
I feel so real
And I owe it all to you

Feel so real
Feel so real
Feel so real

Feel so real
Feel so real
Feel so real

// Power Of Love //

The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a heart to a little white dove
More than a feeling that's the power of love

Tougher than diamonds, whips like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girls dream
Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right
Power of love will keep you home at night

It don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love, that's the power of love

First time you feed, it might make you sad
Next time you feed, it might make you mad
But you'll be glad, baby when you've found
That's the power, makes the world go round

And it don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

They say that all in love is fair
Yeah but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you

And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love, can you feel it?

It don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
You won't feel it when until you feel

You feel the power, just feel the power of love
That's the power and that's the power of love
You feel the power of love, you feel the power of love
You feel the power of love

// Everybody Wants To Rule The World //

Welcome to your life; there's no turning back
Even while we sleep we will find
You acting on your best behavior
Turn your back on mother nature
Ev'rybody wants to rule the world

It's my own desire, it's my own remorse
Help me to decide. Help me make the most
Of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Ev'rybody wants to rule the world

I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the world
Say that you'll never, never, never, need it
One headline, why believe it?
Everybody wants to rule the world

All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

// What A Wonderful World //

What a wonderful, wonderful world this would be
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world

Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the french I took
But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be

Don't know much about geometry
Don't know much trigonometry
Don't know much about algebra
Don't know what a slide rule for
But I know that one and one is two
And if this one could be with you
What a wonderful world this would be

I don't claim to be an "a"-student
But I'm tryin' to be
Maybe by being an "a"-student, baby
I can win your love for me

Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about science books
Don't know much about the french I took
But do know that I love you
And I know that if you love me too
What a wonderful world this would be

I don't claim to be an "a"-student
But I'm tryin' to be
Maybe by being an "a"-student, baby
I can win your love for me

// Every Breath You Take //

Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break, every step you take
I'll be watching you

Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play, every night you stay
I'll be watching you

Oh can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone I been lost without a trace
I dream at night I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace

I keep crying baby, baby, please

Oh can't you see
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Every move you make, every step you take
I'll be watching you

I'll be watching you
(Every breath you take, every move you make)
(Every bond you break, every step you take)
I'll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say)
(Every game you play, every night you stay)

I'll be watching you
(Every move you make, every vow you break)
(Every smile you fake, every claim you stake)
I'll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say)
(Every game you play, every night you stay)

I'll be watching you
(Every breath you take, every move you make)
(Every bond you break, every step you take)
I'll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say)
(Every game you play, every night you stay)

I'll be watching you
(Every move you make, every vow you break)
(Every smile you fake, every claim you stake)
I'll be watching you

// Everytime You Go Away //

Baby, if we can't solve any problems
Why do we lose so many tears?
Oh, so you go again
When the leading man appears

Always the same theme
But can't you see we've got everything
Going on and on and on

And everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
And everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you

Go on and go free
Maybe you're too close to me
I can feel your body move
But does it mean that much to me

I can't go on singing the same theme
'Cause you can't see we've got everything
Baby, even though you know

That everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you
You just don't care
Everytime you go away
You take a piece of me with you

'Cause you can't see we've got everything
Baby, even though you know

That everytime you go away
Everytime you go away

Everytime you go away
Everytime you go away
Everytime you go away

// Broken Wings //

Baby, don't understand
Why we can't just hold on to each other's hands?
This time might be the last if fear unless
I make it all too clear I need you so, ohh

Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
When we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings

Baby, I think tonight
We can take what was wrong and make it right
Baby, it's all I know that you're half of the flesh
And blood that makes me whole, I need you so.

So take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
When we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Yeah, yeah

Let us in
Let us in

Baby, it's all I know that you're half of the flesh
And blood that makes me whole
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

So take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in

Take these broken wings
You got to learn to fly, learn to live and love so free
When we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up for us and let us in
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

// Suddenly //

I use to think that love was just a fairy tale
Until that first hello, until that first smile
But if I had to do it all again
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cuz this love is everlasting

Suddenly
Life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly you're in love
Ooh

Girl you're everything a man could want and more
A thousand words are not enough to say what I feel inside
Holding hands as we walk along the shore
Never felt like this before
Now you're all I'm living for

Suddenly
Life has new meaning to me
There?s beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly you're in love

Each day
I pray
This of love we feel will last forever

Suddenly
Life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly you're in love
You're in love

There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly you're in love

// I Want To Know What Love Is //

I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
I through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Cant stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
I can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
And I wanna feel, I want to feel what love is
And I know, I know you can show me

Lets talk about love
I wanna know what love is, the love that you feel inside
I want you to show me, and I'm feeling so much love
I wanna feel what love is, no, you just cannot hide
I know you can show me, yeah

I wanna know what love is, lets talk about love
I want you to show me, I wanna feel it too
I wanna feel what love is, I want to feel it too
And I know and I know, I know you can show me
Show me love is real, yeah
I wanna know what love is
