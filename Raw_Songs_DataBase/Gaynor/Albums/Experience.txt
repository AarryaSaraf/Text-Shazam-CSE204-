// Casanova Brown //

Let me tell you 'bout that jive type 
That jive type 
Casanova Brown 

I met him at a party 
He said the sweetest things when he hit on me 
Wrapped up in his arms 
I was blinded by his charm and I couldn't see 

Like the story of little red riding hood 
The big bad wolf was up to 
Up to no good, woo, no 

That jive type, that jive type 
Casanova Brown 
He hit on me and he'll hit on you 
That jive type, that jive type 
Casanova Brown 

I was lonely and naive 
I guess that's why I believed every word he says 
It felt so good to hear 
Every time he said he cared it went straight to my head 

He loved me and left me 
But I can't deny 
His love was so doggone good 
I still, I still love that guy, ooh, oh no hey 

That jive type, that jive type 
Casanova Brown 
He hit on me and he'll hit on you, watch out 
That jive type, that jive type, ooh 
Casanova Brown 
Let me tell you 'bout that jive type 
that jive type 
Casanova Brown 
That jive type, that jive type, 
Casanova Brown 

I was sittin' there mindin' my business 
Feelin' good, checkin' things out 
Sippin' on little wine jive type, that jive type
Then I spotted 
Super cool dude cross the room diggin' on me 
I tried to pretend like I didn't even see him 
But he was so fine 
He took my hand and started to dancin' 
I know he felt me fallin' for him 
'Cause he kept holdin' me tighter and tighter, ooh 
Sure was nice 
Girl, my head was all turned around, oh 
I didn't know what I was gettin' into, ooh, ow 

Up to no good, oh no 

That jive type, that jive type 
Casanova Brown 
That jive type, that jive type 
Casanova Brown 

Like the story of little red riding hood 
The big bad wolf was up to 
Up to no good, woo, oh 

That jive type, that jive type 
Casanova Brown 
That jive type, that jive type 
Casanova Brown 
That jive type, that jive type 
Casanova Brown

// (If You Want It) Do It Yourself //

Many years ago my dad said, 'Honey 
Lady Luck may never come your way 
If it's love you want not only money' 
This is what my daddy used to say 

Well, if you want it, go out and get it
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 
Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 

Waitin' around for someone who can help you 
Oh, someone who can help you find your way 
Then if you think there's no one you can turn to 
Well, there's someone just a lookin' glass away 

Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 
Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 

Wishin' and hopin' for your fortune 
Prayin' that you'll see your lucky day 
(Prayin' that you'll see your lucky day)
If you're lookin' for some inspiration 
This is what my daddy used to say 

Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 
Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 

(Prayin' that you'll see your lucky day)

Do-do-do 
Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 

Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 
Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 

Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 
Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself 

Well, if you want it, go out and get it 
You got to do it yourself, do-do-do, do it yourself

// How High The Moon //

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Oh, somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
It's where you are
Oh, somewhere there's heaven
How near, how far
The brightest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will
Ooh, how still
My aching heart
How high the moon

(Somewhere there's music)
(It's where you are)
(Somewhere there's heaven)
(How near, how far)
The brightest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will
Ooh, how still
My aching heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music, music in the air
Oh, and I love this heaven, heaven when you're near
Oh, when you're near
I wanna hear the music
I know it's where you are
Please let me hear it

// I'm Still Yours //

"Been a lot of places.
And met a lot of guys.
One didn't have curly hair.
And one had pretty eyes.
But I don't know whats wrong with me,
I couldn't seem to care.
I just could not accept the love,
They offered me to share.

And I'm still yours.
I'm still yours.

I never thought when we broke up,
That you'd be haunting me.
I thought that when you let me go,
That I would just be free.
But I cant seem to tell my heart,
I can't make it understand.
There may be someone else for me,
You're not the only man.

And I'm still yours,
I'm still yours.

Oooh I'm like a slave
Who's master,
Cause he no longer reigns.
Although your gone,
My heart and my mind,
Are still walked by your chain.
If you can't leave my heart alone
And stop toying with my soul,
Then please come back.
You've got my life to mold.
To have, to hold.

And I'm still yours,
I'm still yours.

I will always be your baby.

// Walk On By //

You always said my eyes 
Were the windows of my soul 
You could always fill my love 
And pain without been told 
I never knew how, but I don't 
Even dare to look at you now. 

So, if you see me walking down the street 
And I start to cry each time we leave 
Walk on by, walk on by 

Make believe 
That you don't see the tears 
Just let me grieve 
In private 'cause each time I see you 
I break down and cry, ooh baby, 
Walk on by, ooh darling 
Please, Walk on by, 
I don't wanna you to see me cry 
Walk on by, please, please 
Baby, baby don't stop... 

So, if you ever love 
Look the other way 
There is anything left to say 
Anyway... 

I just can't get over losing you 
And so if I seem broken and blue 
Walk on by, walk on by 

Foolish pride 
Is all that I have left 
So let me hide 
The tears and the sadness you gave me 
When you said goobye, ooh baby 
Walk on by, ooh sugar 
Walk on by...(baby, baby don't stop) 

Baby, baby don't stop 

Walk on by...ub..eh 
Walk on by... 
Foolish pride 
Is all that I have left 
So let me hide 
The tears and the sadness you gave me 
When you said goodbye 
Walk on by..uuh baby 
Walk on by...uuh sugar 
Walk on by... walk on by 

I don't want to see me cry 
Walk on by, walk on by... 
All the tears that I have cry... 
I don't have nothing left to say... 
Please take your head... look the other way... 
Wow...wow...wow...walk on by... 
Walk on by....
