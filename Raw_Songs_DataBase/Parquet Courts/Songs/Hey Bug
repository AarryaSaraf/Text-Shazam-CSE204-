I was told to be careful of what you give away
I wish they said, "Be careful what you say"
Accumulated feelings like dust-covered possessions
I've seen the last until you let them go
Hey bug, spread thy wings and fly into my heart
It seems as if I've trapped you there again
Like embers floating solely in a big glass jar
The instance it escaped it shed your skin, it shed your skin

And it's now more than ever that I'm feeling the buzz
Hey bug, hey bug, hey bug
And it's now more than ever that I'm feeling the buzz
Hey bug, hey bug, hey bug
And it's louder than ever and I hear it because
Everything around it seems to sway with the buzz
Brightened and delighted like the prey that I was
Hey bug, hey bug, hey bug, hey bug, hey bug!

Do you hear that sound or is it in my head?
Hey bug, hey bug, I didn't see you there
Always through the window, 
I fail the hear where it begins or ends
Hey bug, crawl on top of me but don't attach
Always at a distance and so hard to catch

And it's now more than ever that I'm feeling the buzz
Hey bug, hey bug, hey bug
And it's now more than ever that I'm feeling the buzz
Hey bug, hey bug, hey bug
And it's louder than ever and I hear it because
Everything around it seems to sway with the buzz
Brightened and delighted like the prey that I was
Hey bug, hey bug, hey bug, hey bug, hey bug!
