Faced with a decision:
What do I call bullshit?
A contemporary dilemma
Can I allow this?

Normalization, what am I thinking?
Immunization, power conditioning

Nothing is normal
Manipulated into believing
I'm exercising skepticism
Honesty is everything

Normalization, processed reality
Immunization of what goes on

Lately I've been curious, wondering
Do I pass the Turing test? Do I think?
I'm not sure I wanna know
Can I accept this?
Better safe than sorry

Normalization, collective witnessing
Immunization of human sympathy
Normalization, prefab experience
Immunization, perceived autonomy
