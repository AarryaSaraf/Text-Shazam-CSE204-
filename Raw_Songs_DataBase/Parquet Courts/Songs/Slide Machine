I've been down south where they use the slide machine
Where the gods of old are heard but seldom seen
And here I been just stuck up in between
Yeah, trying, trying, trying to get back to you
Yeah I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying to get back to you

Well the slide machine, it sweeps the bones right off the road
For the tandem trucks and the moats that they tow
And me I've just been looking for one going slow

I'm trying, I'm trying, trying to get back to you
And I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying to get back to you

My woman here, she's got a dozen names
She's sought by soldiers and they try to keep her tame
And her rewards will leave then just the same

I'm trying, I'm trying, trying to get back to you
And I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying to get back to you

I've been down south where they use the slide machine
Where the gods of cold are heard but seldom seen
And here I been just stuck up in between
Yeah, trying, trying, trying to get back to you
Yeah I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying to get back to you
