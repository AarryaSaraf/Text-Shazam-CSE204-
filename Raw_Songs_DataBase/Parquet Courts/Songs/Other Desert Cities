She looked at me like a fry pan reducing
There on the stove, I was lost in the simmer
We made her bed and some eye contact
Don't like this record, please put on another

Sitting at McDonald's drive table
There were joint crash marks on the surface
She looked at me and said, "This house is haunted"
I looked at her and she knew what I wanted

California came away right
Up for  lover's birthday
It was on the wars controlled by
Boredom or personal spy planes

I could not draw the special illusions
Of the town that you were waiting
Was there something you needed to say oh
Was there something you weren't reporting

I was running at the mountain
I was laughing like a hyena
I was crying talking to no one
I was running like a fucking torpedo

She had eyes like a Taco Bell drive-thru
Open late, and there on purpose
I went inside and I said what I wanted
Went to the counter but I got no service

She looked at me like a fry pan reducing
There on the stove I was lost in the simmer
We made her bed, and some eye contact
Don't like this record, please put on another
