I got a friend with a family
And a friend who's in my family
Got a friend who's walking
And a friend who does the walking
Got a friend who could be clever
I've been wondering forever
Is there an answer out there somewhere?

Are they
One and the same
Or what?

I got a friend with manners
Depending who the man is
Got a friend who questions
All of my perceptions
I've been wondering forever
The status distinction
Between my comparable companions

Are they
One and the same
Or not?

I got a friend who worries
And he's always in a hurry
Got a friend who is impatient
In certain situations
Got a friend with obligations
He goes where  will take him
