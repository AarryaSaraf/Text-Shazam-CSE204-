We are conductors of sound, heat and energy
And I bet that you thought you had us figured out from the start
We are conduits of clear electricity
Now you're back on the pitch to take the apparatus apart

You're an ancient now
You're an ancient now
You're an ancient now
On your own

Rebels, teachers
Strikers, sweepers
Better protected
Whenever collected

We are troubled by your soft curiosity
But delighted to be anti everything you were taught
Are you put off by our footloose fluidity
Have your hurt caucasian feelings left you so distraught?

Are you quite done now?
Are you quite done now?
Are you quite done now?
Not at all

Workers, authors
Poets, stoppers
Power resembled
If we are assembled

Only through those who stay awake can an institution be dismantled
It is dishonest, nay, a sin to stand for any anthem that attempts to drown out the roar of oppression

Hesse Total Football
Twombly Total Football
Tzara Total Football
Mina Total Football
Panthers Total Football
KoBrA Total Football
Dada Total Football
Beatles Total Football

Swapping parts and roles is not acting but rather emancipation from expectation
Collectivism and autonomy are not mutually exclusive
Those who find discomfort in your goals of liberation will be issued no apology
And fuck Tom Brady!
