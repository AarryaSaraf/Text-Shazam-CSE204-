Stolen vodka, purchased limes
Kept in bottles of free ice
I don't recall where we got the salt
But the juice came out of friend's advice
You know the dirt ain't dirt in California
She laughed "it's more like golden dust"
But I've been there before and there's a bridge
It's made of gold but the gates still rust

I made up everything I knew
When I wondered something about you
Favorite times of day and favorite foods
I wish I knew more than I do
