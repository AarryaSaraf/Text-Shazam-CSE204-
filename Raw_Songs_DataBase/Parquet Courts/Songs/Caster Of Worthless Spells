We measured the distance of the space between islands
Gazing out into the river Styx she said "It's no river at all
It's a tidal estuary," was her only line, she delivered it well
Oh, you're just a caster of worthless spells
Oh, you're just a caster of worthless spells

They called it the pyrex age, the glass dawn of our thought process
Later to be chronicled in violent history books
"You suffer" on karaoke, cause there was no English translation for hell
Oh, you're just a caster of worthless spells
Oh, you're just a caster of worthless spells
