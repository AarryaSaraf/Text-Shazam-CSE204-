Time seemed to waste itself, those days
It was a world of constant sunsets
That got progressively longer
Until they were all unifying
Into a slow and constant burn
Each moment a humming sizzle
Drifting in and out of our heads
Tidal hisses ebb and flowing
There is no love song I'd sing you
I'd just be wasting my time
