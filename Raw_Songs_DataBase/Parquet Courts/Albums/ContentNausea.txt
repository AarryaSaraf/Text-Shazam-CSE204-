// Everyday It Starts //

Everyday it starts
Everyday it starts
Everyday it starts
Anxiety

Anxiety
Everyday it starts

Anxiety

Anxiety

And I never sleep but I go to bed
And I never sleep but I go to bed
And I never sleep

// Content Nausea //

Content nausea, World War Four
Seems like it all came too soon
Another carnage apparatus
Such a dissapointing doom

I've used money, I've used drugs
Abuse body, abuse mind
People use such strange excuses
Always have done no clue why

Most folks think and some folks know
Life's lived least when you don't let go
Of a memory, of a dream
Like an hometown better seen

On a screen or at a distance
Life lived best without resistance
People clicked and people read
'Modern Life' is what it said

Pretty pictures, pretty lives
I peered into once or twice
I'll go back but not today
It's nice to visit but it's hard to stay

In the grips of bad dimension
Too much data, too much tension
Too much plastic, Too much glass
Life lived least when when fears are passed

My friend he won't leave his home
Says 'I am a bonfire of human bones'
I am a bonfire of human bones
I am a bonfire of human bones

And am I under some spell?
And do my thoughts belong to me?
Or just some slogan I ingested to save time?
This night is missing people

The sea, it had no-one
Hardly no-one, it had shapes, it had light
Some were flashing, most moved
Me, I couldn't look away

But still no-one came or left they just stayed
But they weren't there in the first place
Overpopulated by nothing, crowded by a sparseness
Guided by darkness, too much, not enough

Content, that's what you'd call it
An infant screaming in every room in your gut
Bets strum on an intention but best left unattended
How gathered the pixels in the dust of the digital age to our being

With what do I wash?
Put on some music
My friend walks the same path every day
Steep the stairwell, cognizance to coma

Ignoring best he can
An inconvenient reality
The consequential chore that unfolds in the naked sprint from screen to screen
Scrolling binary ghettos for escape for reminders

And this would be a good year to free poets
From the back padding dungeons of content and comments
To free artists from empty and vulgar broadcasting ritual
For this year it became harder to be tender

Harder and harder to remember
Meeting a friend, writing a letter
Being lost, antique ritual
All lost to the ceremony of progress

Like the sensual organs removed
They're only weighing you down, you didn't need them
Ignore this part, it's an advertisement
These people are famous, I'd trust them

Protesters stayed home this time around
Some enlisted, some never heard the first shots

Well I've been north and I've been south
I've been west and I've been east
Been around long enough to know
Life's lived best when scrolling least

Just a broken piece of plastic
Just another new device
Just another nervous habit
One more thing you have to buy

Just one more thing to replace
One more way to block your face
Too much data, Too much tension
Life's lived least when less is mentioned

Wasting dollars, wasting hours
Wasting talent with wasted power
No one says it but it's known
The more connected, the more alone

My friend stays at the home in the dark
Never walks up to the park
Always nauseous, always tired
I am a landmine, wrong supplier

I am a landmine

// Slide Machine //

I've been down south where they use the slide machine
Where the gods of old are heard but seldom seen
And here I been just stuck up in between
Yeah, trying, trying, trying to get back to you
Yeah I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying to get back to you

Well the slide machine, it sweeps the bones right off the road
For the tandem trucks and the moats that they tow
And me I've just been looking for one going slow

I'm trying, I'm trying, trying to get back to you
And I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying to get back to you

My woman here, she's got a dozen names
She's sought by soldiers and they try to keep her tame
And her rewards will leave then just the same

I'm trying, I'm trying, trying to get back to you
And I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying to get back to you

I've been down south where they use the slide machine
Where the gods of cold are heard but seldom seen
And here I been just stuck up in between
Yeah, trying, trying, trying to get back to you
Yeah I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying to get back to you

// Pretty Machines //

Ah, moonlight
It's hard to believe it
And it's harder to need it
But so easily wanted

Pretty machines
Expensive magazines
I've been tricked into buying quite a number of things
Yeah, bullshit and dreams
Urban ease, it means I always leave taunted
And you think you're a modern person
You think that you can ignore
Silent isolation, my emancipations
In the same place you get yours
Oh, whiskey sips are piling while my secrets escaped
In the skyline of hell there are no fire escapes

Punk songs, I thought that they were different
And I thought that they could end it
No, no it was a deception
Well, the number of tears
And the number of beers were dried out and accounted
For a number of years
But these days I fear that my window was just a reflection
Still, you think that you're not a servant
You think that you can avoid
The stylish institution, worshiping illusions
Things you thought you could destroy
Oh, crowded loud and crimson was my view from the pit
I was wild, I was weird, I was shackled to it

One time, it's so easy the fourth time
But this side of the shoreline, we've already recovered

Pretty machines
Expensive routines
Butted and obstructed quite a number of things
Believe me, it's harder to feel
These days it's harder to suffer
And you think you're a modern person
Think you can watch something change
And move on without you
Side by side with doubt you
Listen to the world exchange
Oh, conversation starters over various meets
In the skyline of hell where the tired retreat

// Psycho Structures //

[?] panel curtains disrupting
The paste, the peace, and the past
Even before they were constructing
Harry said it was built to last
Mother country, daddy's commission
Cause there's a stronger storm every fall
Nowhere left to climb when the ocean rises
Higher than the kevlar walls

Oh, fear's taken over
Fears take him over
Fear's taken over
Fear's taken over

[?] faces [?] from Fulton
In defiance never bows
No one asked permission from no one
Well, no one asked the folks who know 'bout
Bright lighters huddle, conspiring
Rusting in the rockaway snow
Japanese fleet bust beneath our feet
The screech of midnight thunder below
Be it, bends like a wire
Soon to the spire
Steel psycho structures
And dreams falling over

Fear take it over
Fears take him over
Fear had taken over

// The Map //

You'll be uncomfortable 40 percent of the time
When you open the gates of adulthood
A fair warning, dare I question its accuracy?
But still, there was much I wasn't told
And much that wasn't explained
I decided to venture out seeking answers
I went to a professional
"Can you pinpoint the origin of my anxiety?"

The doctor pulled out a map
I studied it, and there I saw:
Envy, bitterness, love, nostalgia, confusion, guilt, and desire
All illuminated like neon on the perimeters of a bustling thoroughfare
Soliciting my neurons for their patronage
Buzzing and pregnant with emotional potential
Ships docking harbors like thoughts approaching the threshold of perception
Towns of rapid traffic synapse intersections
Forests of dense cranial arbors
I continued studying the map

"It's here"
The doctor pointed to an empty patch
There was one road leading out to an empty patch
It didn't dead end but just sort of disappeared in isolation

"Right here?"
I surveyed the space with my finger
The doctor nodded gravely
"I'll leave you with the map for a moment," he said
Then gathered his instruments and neatly exited the room

I traced the path of the disappearing road until it was no longer a road
Tapping with my finger on what I decided was the threshold of the road's existence
I stated, "It is here where I will retire"

// These Boots Are Made For Walkin' //

You keep saying you've got something for me
Something you call love, but confess
That you've been messing where you shouldn't have been messing
And now someone else is getting all your best

Well these boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you

And you keep lying when you ought to be be truthing
And you keep losing when you ought to not bet
Yeah and you keep same-ing when you ought to be changing
Now what's right is right, but ain't been right yet

Well these boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you

And you keep playing where you shouldn't be playing
And you keep thinking that you could never get burned
Yeah well I just found me a brand new box of matches
And what do you know, you ain't got time to learn

Well these boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots
Are gonna walk all over you

Are you ready, boots?
Start walking

// Insufferable //

Recite his ego
To fall through a phone
It's narrow, doubt the wire
Boiling to the bone
Press it more he won't confess
Remember cool and nodding, Jess
Mind the merchant not the buyer
Can this cord be cut, Jess?

Will it end this way?
Will it end this way?
Will the epitaph say...

Nausea keep it down
Disgusted, don't know how
A jerk dressed up in a gentleman's clothes
Just older, uptight now
As a patient, he's compelled
A desire to be found
Just returning to himself
He's been eating like a cow

Will it end this way?
Will it end this way?
Will the epitaph say
Oh... "Insufferable"?

A distance which persists
And choose our roots to grow
When the factory shuts down
Let the boy go home
Let the boy go home
Repeat it conceit with no concept the feeling
Your minds been point interrogate
To read his point, retold, repeating

Will it end this way?
Will it end this way?
Will the epitaph say
"Insufferable"

// Uncast Shadow Of A Southern Myth //

I'd seen the bloodlands of Antietam
The shotgun shack in Tupelo
But a brick circumference left hollow by Sherman
Crumbling before me how it moaned

His shape swallows my recollection
That phantom silhouette implied
Strange fruit rotting from an airborne and hotter than hell
Is this the king's last man I've spied?

I stood there beside my companion
Scratching a rumor he had heard
Do you have a gun?
What? He said, yeah, you mean this one?
Straight down the barrel was his word

And I smelt the fumes he inhaled swiftly
Each word was hinged upon his choke
Like kudzu creeping up a state tree discretely
Forever bending as it broke

And I heard the jangling keys of Graceland
Ring from his teeth stained brown from coke
Drunk and stumbling like a man of distinction
They clamored shaking as he spoke

Of droves of pilgrims at his doorway
Of Reagan, Carter, Clinton, Gore
Fortunes offered them, refused routinely
This ain't no damn auction house he swore

Black male standing around 6 foot something
Ebbs through the waves of small town blight
A minute coldly from southern affection
Collides secretly into night

Forgive those who trespass against us
Began as the dead intruders plea
Into the very muzzle I'd once peered into
He gives the last words he will speak

But that broken glass supports forced entry
Reminds his lawyer through the phone
What southern judge do you know, comforting gently
Who jails white men who defend their home

No souls were present for the moment
His bombed out brick walls finally fell
Lying face down in the throes of atonement
Checked out of the Heartbreak Hotel

He was the uncast shadow of a southern myth [x5]
