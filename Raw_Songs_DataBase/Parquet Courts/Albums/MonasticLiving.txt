Album: MonasticLiving

// No, No, No! //

I don't want to be an essayist
I don't want to be beside your friends
I don't read open letters, long reads or give talks

"No, No, No!"
It's just for them

I don't want to be called a poet
I don't want to be hanged in a museum
I don't want to be cited, tacked onto your cause

"No, No, No!"
I'm just a man

I don't want to be an influence
I don't want you to understand
I don't want to curate, publish no memoir

"No, No, No!"
We're just a band

"No, No, No!"
