// Other Desert Cities //

She looked at me like a fry pan reducing
There on the stove, I was lost in the simmer
We made her bed and some eye contact
Don't like this record, please put on another

Sitting at McDonald's drive table
There were joint crash marks on the surface
She looked at me and said, "This house is haunted"
I looked at her and she knew what I wanted

California came away right
Up for [?] lover's birthday
It was on the wars controlled by
Boredom or personal spy planes

I could not draw the special illusions
Of the town that you were waiting
Was there something you needed to say oh
Was there something you weren't reporting

I was running at the mountain
I was laughing like a hyena
I was crying talking to no one
I was running like a fucking torpedo

She had eyes like a Taco Bell drive-thru
Open late, and there on purpose
I went inside and I said what I wanted
Went to the counter but I got no service

She looked at me like a fry pan reducing
There on the stove I was lost in the simmer
We made her bed, and some eye contact
Don't like this record, please put on another

// Square States //

"How are you, how have you been?"
Sandy
We redeem ourselves in checkpoints, not in true moments of life
Now I wander through the awkward pauses that became our new benchmarks of time
Oh, there's no name for this feeling that your absence has defined

Upon your bedside table lies the graveyard of romance
An empty wrapper weighted by a jar of rocks from France
A necklace used to magnify your eyes, and I made the first advance
Oh, I did it just to break the ice, they needn't be enhanced

"How are you, how have you been?"
I practiced on the drive across the square states in between us to see you alive
I imagine that the first glance there would say if there was something to revive
Oh, I got a room in Bozeman, I had three days to arrive

One more time!

// Largish/Dominant //

There is a silent one
A scalding still grief from within
A house of former logs
The drywall cracking like its skin
A shattered timecard clock
Left in the hallway starts to hiss at you alone, you feel confused
When the chiming time never hits
I've seen you walk it out
And I know what makes you twitch
A set of stab blab scabs
You only scratch to feel the itch
You've got a key lord scar
That you want out there, turning tricks
And you can only speak the truth, with the blood of God, on your lips

Your blue jean pocket has
A faded skull can scar on it
A halo on your ass
The only place that it could fit
At every curtain call
Hold for applause, smile, bow, and catch the rose
It's old and it is proof
Of your finest hour
In this shit

// Tidal Hisses //

Time seemed to waste itself, those days
It was a world of constant sunsets
That got progressively longer
Until they were all unifying
Into a slow and constant burn
Each moment a humming sizzle
Drifting in and out of our heads
Tidal hisses ebb and flowing
There is no love song I'd sing you
I'd just be wasting my time
