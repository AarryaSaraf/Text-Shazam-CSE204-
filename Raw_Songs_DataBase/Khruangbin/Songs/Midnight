You stayed up in Poly
I lived in Crowley Town
Needed me to get you
From your mother's house
Baby, I'll be there just
Put on your lavender
Perfume and a nice dress
Girl, I hope you like this

Midnight black on the outside
Inside, you and I, leather under our skin
Fell deep in a romance way back then we did, we did
Midnight black on the outside
Inside, you and I, leather under our skin
Fell deep in a romance in the back seat we did, we did

Sailing up the highway
You smoked with the windows down
Reflection in the rearview
Fading lights from town
I know you can't stay too late
I'll have you home in time
Let's find a place of silence
Beyond the county line

Midnight black on the outside
Inside, you and I, leather under our skin
Fell deep in a romance way back then we did, we did
Midnight black on the outside
Inside, you and I, leather under our skin
Fell deep in a romance in the back seat we did, we did

Midnight black on the outside
Inside, you and I, leather under our skin
Fell deep in a romance way back then we did, we did
Midnight black on the outside
Inside, you and I, leather under our skin
Fell deep in a romance in the back seat we did, we did

Midnight black on the outside
Midnight black on the outside

I remember how it was back then
We were just young ones
And on that night you said you loved me softly
Left a haze on the window

I had to borrow my mamma's car that night
To come and scoop you
Just for some good fun
And we had a great time that night
I wonder where you are now

So if you hear this let me know
Oh
Maybe we can go again
Oh, yes
