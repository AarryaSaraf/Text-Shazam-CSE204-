Hair pitch black like the midnight sky
Eyes like the jungle, you're something wild
Her sweet melody sings wherever I go
Running through my mind sitting in this road

Maybe I'll write a letter from this little old
Country town down in Texas
I'll keep it here for you
Mariella, Mariella, Mariella, Mariella
Mariella, Mariella, Mari, can we go together

Nothing here changes, seasons go by
You said hello, you said goodbye
Did you run away, Mariella, where did you go?
Somewhere new, somewhere old

Maybe I don't ever wanna live alone
In a country town down in Texas
Ah, with the memory of you
Mariella, Mariella, Mariella, Mariella
Mariella, Mariella, Mariella, Mariella
Mariella, Mariella, Mariella, Mariella
Mariella, Mariella, Mariella, holding onto you
