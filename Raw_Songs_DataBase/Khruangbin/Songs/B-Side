Deeply miss your love
When I'm far away
In another place
All that I dream of
My chest is your pillow

Waiting for your love
You in all the ways
In another place
All I'm thinking of
Just can't get enough

You
May not be
Everywhere I go

Get back

But you stay
On my mind
Wherever I go

Like that

When I fly above
Weeks roll into days
Though I'm far away
Your fantasy I love
Just can't get enough

You
May not be
Everywhere I go

Jump back

But you stay
On my mind
Wherever I go

Like that

Deeply miss your love
When I'm far away
In another place
All that I dream of
My chest is your pillow

Waiting for your love
You in all the ways
In another place
All I'm thinking of
Just can't get enough

(You) I can't wait this long, baby, come to me
(May not be) I'll send you a silver bird, baby, can we
(Everywhere I go) Slide? (Slide like that)
Slide

(But you stay) I can't wait this long, baby, come to me
(On my mind) I'll send you a silver bird, baby, can we
(Wherever I go) Slide? (Slide like that)
Slide

(You) I can't wait this long, baby, come to me
(May not be) I'll send you a silver bird, baby, can we
(Everywhere I go) Slide? (Slide like that)
Slide

(But you stay) I can't wait this long, baby, come to me
(On my mind) I'll send you a silver bird, baby, can we
(Wherever I go) Slide? (Slide like that)
