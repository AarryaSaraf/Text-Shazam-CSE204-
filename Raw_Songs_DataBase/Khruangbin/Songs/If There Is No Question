We cried
From laughing
I'll go

You're not crazy
You're not crazy

Hearts will
Get broken
I'll go
With you

You're not crazy
You're wild
But you're not crazy

We're all in this world
Promises won't last
If there is no answer

Broken
And perfect
I'll go

You're not crazy
You're not crazy

The glass
Will shatter
I'll go
With you

You're not crazy
You're wild
But you're not crazy

We're all in this world
Promises won't last
If there is no question

Broken
Can't laugh at
I'll go

You're not crazy
You're not crazy

The glass
Will shatter
I'll go
With you

You're not crazy
You're wild
But you're not crazy

You're not crazy
You're wild
But you're not crazy

You're not crazy
You're wild
But you're not crazy

You're not crazy
You're wild
But you're not crazy

You're not crazy
You're not crazy
You're not crazy

You're not crazy
You're wild
But you're not crazy

You're not crazy
You're not crazy
