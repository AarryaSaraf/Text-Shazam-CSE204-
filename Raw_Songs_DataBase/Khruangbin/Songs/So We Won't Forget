Ooh, one to remember
Writing it down now
So we won't forget

Ooh, never enough paper
Never enough letters
So we won't forget

Call me, what you want?
Call me, what you need?
Words don't have to say
Keep it to myself

Ooh, every minute
Every hour
So we won't forget

You don't have to be silent
Say to remind me
So we won't forget
Ooh

Call me, what you want?
Call me, what you need?
Words don't have to say
Keep it to myself
Call me, what you want?
Call me, what you need?
Words don't have to say
Keep it to myself

Ooh, one to remember
Writing it down now
So we won't forget

Ooh, never enough paper
Never enough letters
So we won't forget

Ooh, every minute
Every hour
So we won't forget

You don't have to be silent
Say to remind me
So we won't forget
Ooh

Ooh, one to remember
Writing it down now
So we won't forget

Ooh, never enough paper
Never enough letters
So we won't forget

Ooh, every minute
Every hour
So we won't forget

You don't have to be silent
Say to remind me
So we won't forget

Ooh, say you remember
For I think I've lost it
