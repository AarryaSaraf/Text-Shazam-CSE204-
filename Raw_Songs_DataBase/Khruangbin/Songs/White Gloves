She was a queen
She had a house
She was a fighter
She was a queen

Had a good dude
Bought me a rabbit
She was a queen
Wearing white gloves

But she kept 'em clean
Classy Lady
But she wasn't quiet
She was a queen

One day she was gone
She died in a fight
Cause she was a fighter
She was a queen
She was a queen
She was a queen
She was a queen
