// I'll Be Good To You //

I want to know
Just how you feel
Said-a I want to know
If what you feel is real

'Cause there is a reason, yeah
For the things that I say
I want to love you, girl
In a special way

We've been together
For so very long
I would hate to break up
Break up our happy home

The way we stand and the way we lie
The way we love and the way we cry
Of all these things there lies a tie
Makes me feel that it's worth a try
I'll be good to you

Good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you

'Cause there is a reason
For the things that I say
I wanna love you, girl
In a special way

We've been together
For so very long
I would hate to break up
Break up our happy home

Take a step now, and let me know how
All of your ways, girl
And all your know-how's
I'll be good to you

Good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you

Good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you

Good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you

Good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you

Good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you, good to you
I'll be good to you, good to you

// Free And Single //

Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha, ha

I'm a man full of fun
I can't stop, must book, I gotta run
'Cause there's things I got to do
I can't do 'em all staying with you

Now if you want me, you got to get me
But I promise you that you'll miss me
I know you can't hold on
'Cause this bull is much to strong

Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha, ha

I got to keep movin' around
I can't let nothing tie me down
'Cause once you've got a love jones
You've got to be at home jones

There's no way that I can do it
I can't seem to satisfy you
If you want me all the time, girl
I can't promise I'll be true

Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha, ha

Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ha, ha

There's people I got to see
I got to move along to be me
You can't stop the rainin'
You can't mend a heart when it's painin'

So I'd rather not be
What you want to see
I don't want to see you cry
When I give someone else a try

Free and single
Free and single
Free and single
Free and single

There's no way that I can do it
Free and single
I can't seem to satisfy you
Free and single
If you want me all the time, girl
Free and single
I can't promise I'll be true, yeah
Free and single
I can't promise I'll be true

I might change
I might change
Rearrange on you

I said, I might change
I might change
Rearrange, like I always do

I might keep you one day
The next, I won't have ya
I might keep you one day
The next day, I'll have me a new one

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh-oh-oh, come on

Well, it's the way I am
And the way I'll be
If you want to stay
Come on and see me

But I might change
I might change, tell me
I might change or rearrange

I might change your brain
I might change your brain
I might change your brain
Or rearrange all your marbles, hey
Well

Ah, one day, it might be you
The next day, I might have two...

// Come Together //

Here come old flattop, he come grooving up slowly
He got joo-joo eyeball he one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker he just do what he please

He wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger, he shoots Coca-Cola
He say "I know you, you know me"
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Come together right now, over me

He bag production, he got walrus gumboot
He got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knees
Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease
Come together right now, over me

He roller-coaster he got early warning
He got muddy water he one mojo filter
He say "One and one and one is three"
Got to be good-looking 'cause he's so hard to see
Come together right now, over me

// Dancin' And Prancin' //

Four scores and yesterdays
And way back when, just to begin, my friends
There was music in the air, somewhere
For those who wanted to sigh and even grin
Music for the soul so sweet
Relaxed their minds and moved their feet
And kicked off a beat

And they were dancin'
I said, they were prancin'
Whoa-whoa
They were dancin'
I said, they were prancin'

People started everywhere
To dig the sound and act a clown for you
While others sat back in deep thought
Not knowing what to do
It was really hard to accept
And some minds were blown along with the rest I know
And when it grew louder
Some folks got up and said they had to go
The music grabbed them by the hands
And snapped their fingers and then they dug the band
They tried to run, but that's where the fun begun

They were dancin'
They were prancin'
I said, they were dancin'
They were prancin'

Dancin'
Prancin'
Dancin'
They were prancin'

I said, they were dancin'
They were prancin'
Dancin'
Prancin'...

// The Devil //

You know the Devil is on your case
I said, the Devil, don't make haste
He will try to get you when he can
He will try to take you, take you by the hand

He will take you down with him
He won't waste no time
He will have your ass burnin'
Oh, ah, right on time
He will try to abuse you
You know he'll use you
He'll keep right on
To keep himself strong

He is the Devil
He is deceitful
They call him Satan
They call him Lucifer

He will take you down with him
He won't waste no time
He will have your ass burnin'
Oh, ah, right on time
He will try to abuse you
You know he'll use you
He'll keep right on
To keep himself strong

He is the Devil
He is deceitful
They call him Satan
They call him Lucifer
