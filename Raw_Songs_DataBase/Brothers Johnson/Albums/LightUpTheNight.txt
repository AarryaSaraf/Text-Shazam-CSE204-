Album: LightUpTheNight

// Stomp! //

Steppin' out the weekends open wide
Fill it up, let's blast the jams and ride

While we're cruisin' around in the street
Listen up for the party in feet
Slap me five that's the place we've arrived, it's alive

Ev'rybody take it to the top we're
Gonna stomp all night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right

Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party
Till the morning light

Runnin', runnin', runnin'

The set is hot, there's people wall to wall
Old ones, young things, short ones standing tall

So grab the one with the smile on her face
And hit the floor and stay right on the case
The heat is on and the funk just won't leave us alone

Ev'rybody take it to the top we're
Gonna stomp all night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right

Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party
Till the morning light

Gonna stomp all night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right

Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party
Till the morning light

Stomp!

Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it

Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heels where you're feeling it

Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit

Put your heels where you're feeling it

Stomp all night
In the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right

Wanna party
Till the morning light

Stomp all night
In the neighbourhood

// Light Up The Night //

Light up the night

Let's set the world on fire

Light up the night

To strike up, come on let's light the situation
Let's hit the city find some people we know
And light the night, come on girl we got to glow, glow

We want to take you higher

Come on you got to get your motor running
Tonight, the night were gonna have the sun in
[unverified] what you feel that you're a fire inside
Then hold me tight in the moonlight of the night

// Treasure //

Moonlight won't ever be cold
As long as I have you to hold
And if I'm away from your side
You know that I'll miss you
From morning till night

Girl, I treasure each moment you're near
Treasure that good thing we share

Just one little smile is more than enough
To give me the pleasure
That comes with the treasure of love

I don't own a house on the hill
I ain't got a boat in the bay
But I know with you in my arms
I'm holding a diamond
That shines every day

Girl, I treasure each moment you're near
Treasure that good thing we share

And I'm not afraid to tell anyone
That I need your magic
To keep me love strong

Girl, I treasure each moment you're near
Treasure that good thing we share

And I'll never need dreams in my life
'Cause you make them all come true
And now life's a pleasure
'Cause I found a treasure in you

// All About The Heaven //

Feelings you've never felt before
Could be you're dreaming
But you don't know sure
What is this feeling leading to

Long nights of staring at the walls
Until the dawn light, can't get no sleep at all
There's only one thing you can do
Get on the phone to try and talk it through

Well that's all, all about the heaven
That realizing you need someone to love
Yes it's all, all about the heaven
Girl that's what I've been thinking of your love

Those blue days
It never seems to matter what you do days
'Cause nothing's going right
The sun just seems to pass you by

And heartaches that linger on and on
Until your heart makes you see that something's wrong
And then you start to wonder why
And see what you've been missing in your life

Well that's all, all about the heaven
That realizing that you need someone to love
Yes it's all, all about the heaven
Girl that's what I've been thinking of your love

So hold me tight
And prove to me that this thing ain't over tonight
Go love me right
So we can face the morning with the magic of tonight

Well that's all, all about the heaven
That finding out you're needing someone to love
All, all about the heaven
Girl that's what I've been thinking of your love

All, all about the heaven
Feels so right, and I want you all night

All, all about the heaven
I can't let go, I just want you to know

// Closer To The One That You Love //

You get to me, fine lady
Understand my love
When we meet I'm ready
You turn me on so long
I choose you
Forever and a day
Ain't no other woman
Can make me feel the way
I do
Been losing sleep over you
Girl, when you're next to me
The sun comes shining through

Get closer to the one that you love
You got a reason to make her stay
A little closer to the one that you love
Get closer to the one that you love
Don't let that woman just slip away
Stay closer to the one that you love

I've seen those gaming ladies
I don't understand
In their eyes I see it
There's that master plan
I can't use it. I'll never have the time
Looking through it
Truth of it is a kind
I need
The only dream that's for me
'Cause I was kicking around
Until you hit me with your smile

Get closer to the one that you love
You got a reason to make her stay
A little closer to the one that you love
Get closer to the one that you love
Don't let that woman just slip away
Stay closer to the one that you love

Get closer to the one that you love
You got a reason to make her stay
A little closer to the one that you love
Get closer to the one that you love
Don't let that woman just slip away
Stay closer to the one that you love
