You know the Devil is on your case
I said, the Devil, don't make haste
He will try to get you when he can
He will try to take you, take you by the hand

He will take you down with him
He won't waste no time
He will have your ass burnin'
Oh, ah, right on time
He will try to abuse you
You know he'll use you
He'll keep right on
To keep himself strong

He is the Devil
He is deceitful
They call him Satan
They call him Lucifer

He will take you down with him
He won't waste no time
He will have your ass burnin'
Oh, ah, right on time
He will try to abuse you
You know he'll use you
He'll keep right on
To keep himself strong

He is the Devil
He is deceitful
They call him Satan
They call him Lucifer
