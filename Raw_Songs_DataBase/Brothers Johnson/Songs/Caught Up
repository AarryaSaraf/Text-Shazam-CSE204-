The time is now
Get your gear ready to fly
Gatherin' around
No holdin' us down
We're leavin' the ground

Caught in the clouds
So spread the news
Cause the music's sweeter
There beautiful sound
Is to be found
It's all around

Caught in the clouds
It's gettin' late
What cha waitin' for?
Come on
Gatherin' around
No holdin' us down
We're leavin' the ground

Caught in the clouds
Caught up in the clouds of love
You and I in clouds of love
Said we're flying high
Gonna meet you in the sky
