In a minute, you'll be right on time
In a minute, you'll be right on time

Now when you're dancin' to the music
Just let yourself go and move right into it
Don't be bashful, don't be ashamed
Because there's somebody, just wanna know your name
Everybody do it, let me see you move it

In a minute, you'll be right on time
In a minute, you'll be right on time

Now go on and get down and party, party
Don't you wanna party, party
Let me see ya party, party
Feelin' like a party, party

Everybody do it, let me see you move it

In a minute, you'll be right on time
In a minute, you'll be right on time
In a minute, you'll be right on time
In a minute
In a minute, you'll be right on time

Watch out, y'all, we said the funk was comin'

Right on time, right on time
Right on time, right on time
In a minute
Right on time, right on time

We said the funk was comin'
Right on time, right on time
In a minute
Right on time, right on time
Right on time, right on time
In a minute
Right on time, right on time

We said the funk was comin'
Right on time, right on time
In a minute
Right on time, right on time
Let me see ya get down...
