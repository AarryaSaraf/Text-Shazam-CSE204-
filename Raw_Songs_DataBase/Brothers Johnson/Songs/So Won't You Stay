Two together, love forever
That's how it should be

One so lonely, two's the only way to be
Won't you stay with me
Fulfill my fantasy

Love's the season
You're the reason
I feel ours is real

Time will measure
All the pleasure
Don't be shy
Oh how time can fly
Let's not say goodbye

So won't you stay
Together we'll find a way
So baby won't you stay
Don't give all your love away
To the world 'cause they could never feel
The tenderness of all your love
Like I do
Won't you stay with me
I need you baby

So won't you stay
Together we'll find a way
So baby won't you stay
Don't give all your love away
To the world 'cause they could never feel
The tenderness of all your love
Like I do
Won't you stay with me
You belong to me
Won't you stay with me
