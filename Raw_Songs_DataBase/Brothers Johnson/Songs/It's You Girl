We talk about it every day
Seems your love don't wanna come my way
I've been wrong so long
And played little games
Just can't believe I could ever change

But I will for you and me, you'll see
Just let our love grow naturally
My words go round and round and upside down
I don't care
I don't care who knows it

'Cause it's you girl and you know it
Me and you girl
We've got a good thing goin'
It's you girl and you know it
Me and you girl
We've got a good thing goin'

Don't pay no mind to what folks say
This time it's up to me, this time I'm gonna stay
I used to roam without reason, I would roam
And now with you, my love has found a home

So trust me baby and you'll see
Just let our love grow naturally
My words go round and round and upside down
I don't care
I don't care who knows it

'Cause it's you girl and you know it
Me and you girl
We've got a good thing goin'
It's you girl and you know it
Me and you girl
We've got a good thing goin'
