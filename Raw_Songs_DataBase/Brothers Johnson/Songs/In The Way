The victim of circumstance
In thinking he's found his only chance
She pulls him further 'way
A future like ours to see
Whatever will be will surely be
So the people say

But there's something in the way that she feels
Something not entirely real
I've told you before and I won't anymore
Got to pick up what's real
Said you got to pick up what's real

You used to walk well with two
But the first got the best of you
The second apologies
You sit by the telephone
Taking calls from the ones you've known
Something we all can see

But there's something in the way that she feels
Something not entirely real
I've told you before and I won't anymore
Got to pick up what's real
Said you got to pick up what's real

But there's something in the way that she feels
Something not entirely real
I've told you before and I won't anymore
Got to pick up

Something in the way that she feels
Something not entirely real
I've told you before and I won't anymore
Something in the way that she feels
Something not entirely real
I've told you before and I won't anymore
Got to pick up what's real
Said you got to pick up what's real

Something in the way she feels
Something
Something in the way she feels
Something
Said you got to pick up what's real
Something that you got to feel
Something
Something in the way she feels
