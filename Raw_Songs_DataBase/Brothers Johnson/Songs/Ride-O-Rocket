If we get to Jupiter
We'll be on the right course
Past the satellite
We're bound to meet the force

And we'll beam, we'll beam, we'll beam, we'll beam
Shaka!
How high
Where is infinity?
Where lies the mystery

Dilliup, dilliup, dilliup, dilliup
Ride-o-rocket
Oh, yeah, do it, do it, do it, do it
Ride-o-rocket
Aw, come on

Neptune is the place
That I know nothing of
So take me to Venus
She's the goddess of love

And we'll beam, we'll beam, we'll beam
I'll make you scream
Shaka!
How far
Must we go past the sun
Are we the only ones

Dilliup, dilliup, dilliup, dilliup
Ride-o-rocket
Oh, take me to it, take me to it
Ride-o-rocket
Oh, ride, rid, ride, ride
Ride-o-rocket

Ride-o-rocket
Won't you do it, do it, do it, do it
Ride, ride, ride

How far
Must we go past the sun
Are we the only ones

Dilliup, dilliup, dilliup, dilliup
