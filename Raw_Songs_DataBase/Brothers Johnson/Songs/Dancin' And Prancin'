Four scores and yesterdays
And way back when, just to begin, my friends
There was music in the air, somewhere
For those who wanted to sigh and even grin
Music for the soul so sweet
Relaxed their minds and moved their feet
And kicked off a beat

And they were dancin'
I said, they were prancin'
Whoa-whoa
They were dancin'
I said, they were prancin'

People started everywhere
To dig the sound and act a clown for you
While others sat back in deep thought
Not knowing what to do
It was really hard to accept
And some minds were blown along with the rest I know
And when it grew louder
Some folks got up and said they had to go
The music grabbed them by the hands
And snapped their fingers and then they dug the band
They tried to run, but that's where the fun begun

They were dancin'
They were prancin'
I said, they were dancin'
They were prancin'

Dancin'
Prancin'
Dancin'
They were prancin'

I said, they were dancin'
They were prancin'
Dancin'
Prancin'...
