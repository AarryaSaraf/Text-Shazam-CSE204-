Sunlight you are my little sunlight
You shined into my life
I've been waitin' for someone like you
To reflect on me the way you do

Sunlight
You always seem to shine bright fantasy
Fantasize
You are the one of a kind in my life
Love shines in a way felt by one who says
To need love is one thing
I see the joy it brings
Little light
I've never seen a flash of light
Designed just for me
Were you meant?
Maybe sent by a God above me
If it's true keep shining through

Sunlight
You always seem to shine bright fantasy
Fantasize
You are the one of a kind in my life
Love shines in a way felt by one who says
To need love is one thing
I see the joy it brings

Sunlights
Up my life everyday and night
The sight of seeing you just makes my day
And through your eyes
There's a gleam of delight
Love shines in again and again and again
I find I've got peace of mind
You shined my way
