Your state of mind
Is not the way you should feel all the time
My point of view of you
You should leave all your troubles behind

Sitting alone
Don't know how much longer this can go on
Until you find peace
You've got to stand straight up on your two feet

Free yourself, be yourself
Let love come into your heart
It's a perfect way to start
Be yourself, free yourself
Shake your blues away, invest
You'll find joy and happiness

Some things you do
You know you try, but it just won't come through
Then you wind up, alone
In your room with a new shade of blue

It's not the way
That you should spend the better part of your day
Wasting away
With nothing left but to face a new day

Free yourself, be yourself
Let love come into your heart
It's a perfect way to start
Be yourself, free yourself
Shake your blues away, invest
You'll find joy and happiness

Free yourself, be yourself
Let love come into your heart
It's a perfect way to start
Be yourself, free yourself
Shake your blues away, invest
You'll find joy and happiness

Get on up, Girl
You can do it
Live your life, Girl
You can do it
Come on, Baby
You can do it
You can do it
You can do it

Free yourself, be yourself
Let love come into your heart
It's a perfect way to start
Be yourself, free yourself
Shake your blues away, invest
You'll find joy and happiness
