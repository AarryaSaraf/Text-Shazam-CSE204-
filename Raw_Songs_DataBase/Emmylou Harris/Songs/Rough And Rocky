Darlin' I have come to tell you
Tho' it almost breaks my heart
But before the mornin', darlin'
We'll be many miles apart

Don't this road look rough and rocky
Don't that sea look wide and deep
Don't my baby look the sweetest
When he's in my arms asleep

Can't you hear the nightbird's cryin'
Far across the deep blue sea
While others you are thinking
Won't you sometimes think of me

Don't this road look rough and rocky
Don't that sea look wide and deep
Don't my baby look the sweetest
When he's in my arms asleep

One more kiss before I leave you
One more kiss before we part
You have caused me lots of trouble
Darlin', you have broke my heart

Don't this road look rough and rocky
Don't that sea look wide and deep
Don't my baby look the sweetest
When he's in my arms asleep
