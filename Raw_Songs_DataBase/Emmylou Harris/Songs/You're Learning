You are learning what it's like to sit and cry
And wonder why your plans went wrong
You are learning how it feels when pain is real
To realize you're all alone
Yes you're learning

We had the chance to be happy
Nothing stood in our way
If only you'd meant what you promised
We wouldn't crying today

You are learning that a lie can make you cry
For the truth your heart reveals
You are learning that a flirt can cause a hurt
Even though your love is real
Yes you're learning

We had the chance to be happy
Nothing stood in our way
If only you'd meant what you promised
We wouldn't crying today

You are learning that a lie can make you cry
For the truth your heart reveals
You are learning that a flirt can cause a hurt
Even though your love is real
Yes you're learning
Yes you're learning
