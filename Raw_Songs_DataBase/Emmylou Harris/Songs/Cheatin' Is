Cheatin' is a thing that starts when you bring
Two lonely people face to face with a brand new kiss
She blames him and he blames her
Neither one is really quite sure which way it really is
And all of the time in the back of their minds
They know they're gonna have to lie about where they've been
Cheatin' is a thing that takes a little ring
And break it into pieces that'll never go together again

Cheatin' is the part of lovin' that starts
When true love isn't what lovers are looking for
A stranger here, a stranger there
Then you turn around and swear that you'll never go back for more
And lying at night when you're holding him tight
Is something that a cheater's heart is bound to learn
Cheatin' is a thing that's guaranteed to bring
Two unhappy people to the point of no return

And the worst of cheatin' is the sad little kids
Hangin' in the middle while mommy and daddy choose
Cheatin' is a game where nobody wins
But the ones that aren't big enough to play are the ones who lose
