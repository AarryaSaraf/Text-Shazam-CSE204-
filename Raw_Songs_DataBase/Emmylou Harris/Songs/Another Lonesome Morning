Another lonesome morning
Another long lonesome day
You'll have to live without him
The morning seemed to say
Another lonesome morning
You thought you didn't care
But morning breezes find   you
Wishing he were there

Bobwhite sings his same old song
Trying hard to please
And you hear the sound
That he used to love
Thru the rustlin' of the leaves
Thru the rustlin' of the leaves

You  losing him has taught you
That you  wanted him to stay
And you know that all another lonesome morning brings
Is another lonesome day
All another lonesome morning brings
Is another lonesome day
Is another lonesome day
