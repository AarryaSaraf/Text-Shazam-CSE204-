Lonely tears roll down
As midnight comes around
But I can make it trough
In sweet dreams of you

In the shadow of the night
I still hold you tight
Did, it all comes true
In sweet dreams of you

In sweet dreams I see
The way thing you to be
When your love was thide
And your heart was true
In sweet dreams of you

Oh, I call out your made
And you come to me again
The way you used to do
In sweet dreams of you
In sweet dreams of you
In sweet dreams of you
