Each night I leave the barroom when it's over
Not feeling any pain at closing time
But tonight you memory found me much to sober
Couldn't drink enough to keep you off my mind

Tonight the bottle let down
and let you memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let down

I've always had a bottle I could turn to
And lately I've been turning everyday
But the wind don't take effect the way it used to
And I'm hurting in an old familiar way

Tonight the bottle let down
and let you memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let down
