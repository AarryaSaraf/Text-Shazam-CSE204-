You may wonder if you know me
You may wonder if I care
Or if I'll leave you sad and lonely
Or if I'll always be right there
Well there's no need for doubt now darlin'
'Cause I have come to know
This love of ours is no common flower
You know this love is like a red, red rose

And you may wonder about this dreamer
If she's all you thought she'd be
And, oh, if anything but someday
Ever comes from lovin' me
But hold me close and tell me darlin'
That you have come to know
This love I bring you is no common thing
You know this love is like a red, red rose

When you're all caught up in sweet surrender
Simple truth is sometimes hard to see
Here between the tough times and the tender
It all comes down to you and me

And you may see my heart of darkness
I may stumble now and again
But underneath this heart of darkness
There's a heart that's lovin' you right till the end
So hold me close, come hold me darlin'
'Cause I want you to know
This love of ours is no common flower
You know this love is like a red, red rose

This love of ours is no common flower
You know this love is like a red, red rose
