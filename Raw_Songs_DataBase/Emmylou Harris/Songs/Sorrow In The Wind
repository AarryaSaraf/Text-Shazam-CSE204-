I hear the soft wind sighing
In every bush and tree
The sound of my heart crying
When you are far from me

When we're apart, my darlin'
There's sorrow in the wind
When we're apart, my darlin
Sweet sorrow in the wind

You leave me in the morning
Your footsteps die away
Tho' not a leaf is stirring
I hear the wind all day

When we're apart, my darlin'
There's sorrow in the wind
When we're apart, my darlin'
Sweet sorrow in the wind

They say when love grows older
It dies and fades away
Yet all our life together
One ever brightening day

When we're apart, my darlin'
There's sorrow in the wind
When we're apart, my darlin'
Sweet sorrow in the wind

When we're apart, my darlin'
There's sorrow in the wind
When we're apart, my darlin'
Sweet sorrow in the wind
Sweet sorrow in the wind
