I want 'em, I need 'em
And I'm gonna go out and get 'em
White shoes

I know I'll feel better
When I slide down into the leather
White shoes

White shoes ... woah, oh, oh... white shoes
White shoes ... woah, oh, oh... white shoes

I woke up from a dream
When I saw 'em in a magazine
White shoes

I said Lou you gotta start new
And the first thing you gotta do
Is get some white shoes

White shoes ... woah, oh, oh... white shoes
White shoes ... woah, oh, oh... white shoes

You know he left me with the lonesome blues
Been hangin' 'round too long with nothin' to do
Yeah, he really made me pay those dues
But I'm goin' out on the town tonight in
White shoes

Well, I wanted 'em, I needed 'em
Yeah, and I went out and got 'em
White shoes
That new boy when I see him
I'm gonna walk right up and meet him in
White shoes

White shoes ... woah, oh, oh... white shoes

White shoes
I'm goin' out on the town tonight

White shoes ... woah, oh, oh... white shoes
White shoes ... woah, oh, oh... white shoes
