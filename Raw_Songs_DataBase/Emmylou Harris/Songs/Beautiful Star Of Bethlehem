Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem
Shining afar through shadows dim
Giving the light for those who long have gone
Guiding the wise men on their way
Unto the place where Jesus lay

Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem
(Beautiful, beautiful star)Of Bethlehem
(Star of Bethlehem)

Shine upon us until the glory dawns
Give us the light to light the way
Unto the land of perfect day

Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on
Oh beautiful star, the hope of life
Guiding the pilgrims through the night
Over the mountains till the break of dawn
Into the light of perfect day
It will give out a lovely ray

Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on
Oh beautiful star, the hope of rest
For the redeemed, the good and the blest
Yonder in glory when the crown is won
Where Jesus is now the star divine
Brighter and brighter he will shine
Oh beautiful star of Bethlehem, shine on
