I often sing, for those I love
Who go to live, with Christ above
No more on earth, their forms I'll see
When I am gone, who'll sing for me
Who'll sing for me, when I am gone
And it won't be long, 'til (when) I'll see
When I am gone, who'll sing for me

'Til I too, must say goodbye
Just over there, with Christ I'll be
Get all my friends, to sing for me

Who'll sing for me, when I am gone
As I so oft, for friends have done
And it won't be long, 'til (when) I'll see
When I am gone, who'll sing for me
