Guess it's time for me to say just how it is that I feel today
Today is just like any other day cause you've been on my mind
It really hasn't been that long but it's funny where the time has flown
Old memories just keep holding on and you been on my mind

You been on my mind sometimes
I think I must be going blind
I've seen a world baby without you
But I don't see myself there too

Hardly does a day go by when I don't see your clear blue eyes
Many night I just wonder why and you been on my mind
You've been on my mind so long
I've been thinking that something was wrong
I've told myself I should forget
But I don't seem to have it yet
I don't dream that you might change I don't think that I'm acting strange
I tell myself it's all in vain and you been on my mind

You've been on my mind I've said
Till it's all that's in my head
Yes I know what I must do
But I don't think you'll be there too

Guess it's time for me to go but as it is I'll never know
Just what it is that I long for so And you been on my mind

You been on my mind
