When darkness fills the valley
Fear and dread strive deep within us
But our burdens soon will be lifted
When these old homes turn to dust

When He calls
I'm going to live with Jesus
In His kingdom He welcomes everyone
I shall not fear no more earthly peril
For He will carry me Home

Now Satan will come to tempt me
But I'll try to resist sinful ways
And I pray that I'll find salvation
In that peaceful Home far away

When He calls
I'm going to live with Jesus
In His kingdom He welcomes everyone
I shall not fear no more earthly perils
For He will carry  Home

When He calls
I'm going to live with Jesus
In His kingdom He welcomes everyone
I shall not fear no more earthly peril
He will carry me Home
