Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron

Shadows touch the sand and look to see who's standin'
Waitin' at your window, watchin' will they ever show
Can you hear them calling?
You know they have fallen on
Campfires cold and dark that never see a spark burn bright

Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron

Trails that brought them home echo names the've known
Four days high and lonely comin' to you only
You're the one they'd turn to, the only one they knew who'd do
All her best to be around when the chips were down

Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron
Shadows touch the sand and look to see who's standin'
Waitin' at your window, watchin' will they ever show

Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron
