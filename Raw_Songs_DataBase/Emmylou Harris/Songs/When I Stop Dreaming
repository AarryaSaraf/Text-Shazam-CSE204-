The worst that I've ever been hurt
In my life
The first time I ever have
Wanted to die
Was the night when you told me
You loved someone new
And you asked me if I could forget

When I stop dreaming
That's when I'll stop loving you

You may teach the flowers
To bloom in the snow
You may take a pebble
And teach it to grow
You may teach all the raindrops
To return to the clouds
But you can't teach my heart
To forget
