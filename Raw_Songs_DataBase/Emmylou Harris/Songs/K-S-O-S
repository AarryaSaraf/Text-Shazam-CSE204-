Come gather 'round me boys and lend an car
I've got some things I think you all should hear
It's time to shift into another gear
I've reached my final destination
Bought a radio station
And she's fifty thousand watts, pure and clear

K-S-O-S help is on the way
Twenty-four hours of every day
A voice in the wilderness
And we're here to stay
K-S-O-S
