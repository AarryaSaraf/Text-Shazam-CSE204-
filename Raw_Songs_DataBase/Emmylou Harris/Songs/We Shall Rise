In that Resurrection morning
When the trumpet of God shall sound
We shall rise, (hallelujah) we shall rise.
Then the saints will come rejoicing and
no tears will e'er be found
We shall rise, (hallelujah) we shall rise.

We shall rise, (hallelujah) we shall rise (amen)
We shall rise, (hallelujah)
In that Resurrection morning
when these prison bars are broken
We shall rise, (hallelujah) we shall rise.

In that Resurrection morning
when the shades of life has fled
We shall rise, (hallelujah) we shall rise.
In the day of glory dawning when the sea
gives up His dead
We shall rise, (hallelujah) we shall rise.

I shall see my blessed Savior
who so freely died for me
We shall rise, (hallelujah) we shall rise.
And our fathers and our mothers and our
loved ones we shall see
We shall rise, (hallelujah) we shall rise.
