Away in a manger,
No crib for his bed,
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down his sweet head.
The stars in the bright sky
Looked down where he lay,
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay.
The cattle are lowing,
The baby awakes,but little Lord Jesus
No crying he makes.
I love you, Lord Jesus!
Look down from the sky,
And stay by my cradle
Til morning is nigh.
