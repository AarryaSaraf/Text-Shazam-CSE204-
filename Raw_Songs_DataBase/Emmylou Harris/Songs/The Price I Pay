They tell me I'm the talk of the town
I've been staying home alone every night
It's nobody's business where I'm bound
As if to be alone and lonely just ain't right

On a old freight train moving down the line
I'm counting each day and every minute that your away
I've never been the stay at home kind
But for you it's just the price that I pay

It's just the price I pay for loving you
The price I pay for needing you so much
The price I pay for needing you
And putting all this time between us

I knew I was in trouble when we met
Dark clouds all around me I couldn't find the light
The hard time ain't hard to forget
I believe in love at first sight

I put my heart and soul on the line
And know your love is with me every day
Your picture always there on my mind
But for you it's just the price that I pay

It's just the price I pay for loving you
The price I pay for needing you so much
The price I pay for needing you
And putting all this time between us
