Baby brought me in out off the highway
Poured my right good liquor down the sink
Straightened out my crooked ways of thinking
Made it purely pleasure when I drank

And it's all right now
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat
I'm drunk on Bluebird Wine

Baby's up and running in the morning
Says she's got a million things to do
While I'm gone, says, you go get your guitar
Write some pretty song about me and you

And it's all right now
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat
I'm drunk on Bluebird Wine

Baby says she'd really love a party
We'll get some friends together feelin' fine
Any friend of mine is worth his habit
A belly full of baby's Bluebird Wine

And it's all right now
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat
I'm drunk on Bluebird Wine

Yes it's all right now
I've just hit my stride
Fun it just started and
I'm drunk on Bluebird Wine
