Praise God I feel like singing
I'm on the other side of life now

All my days of sorrow
And tears for my loved ones
I wish I could tell them the door that I feel
Though my body is weary
My soul is uplifted
My sins are forgiven and my Jesus is real

Praise God I feel like singing
I'm on the other side of life now

Though my eyes are dim
I see Heaven clearly
Though my voice grows feeble I sing just the same
In my heart there's a song
As I see the gates open
I'll sing forever my joyous refrain

Praise God I feel like singing
I'm on the other side of life now
Praise God I feel like singing
I'm on the other side of life now
