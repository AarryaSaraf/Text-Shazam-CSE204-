Winter Summer seasons is taken over  it's quiet
Like new fallen snow
I told you summer stories  but outside is getting mighty cold
I told you everything I could about me
Told you everything I could
How would you feel if the world was falling apart around you

Pieces of the sky were falling in your neighbors yard
But not on you
Wouldn't you feel just a little bit funny
Think maybe there's  something you oughta do

Solutions that never lay down before you the answers are all around
Believing is all the friend you need to talk to
Believing in you
I told you everything I could about me
Told you everything I could

I told you everything I could about me
Told you everything I could
