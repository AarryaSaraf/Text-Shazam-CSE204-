Roses are red
Violets are blue
Primrose is pale
On the velvet green hue
Warm summer days
Like cool water falls
Like music we hear
Those things we'll always hold dear
Like an old fashioned waltz

When the moonlight shines down
On the Hollywood world
And the heroine waits
For her love to return
And the violins play
From behind garden walls
Oh how I love to remain
With the silver refrain
Of an old fashioned waltz

And they dance 'round the floor
And there's no one else there
In the world is no worry
And is never a care
By the perfect moon
As the nightingale calls
With only the moon
And the nostalgic tune
Of an old fashioned waltz
