Well I used to roll and I used to ramble
Out on the wilder side of town
Every night I hear the  bright lights calling
I never thought I could ever settle down.
Well, I seen a whole lot of pain  and trouble
In this lonesome life of mine
But you gave me love and you gave it double
And I'll always be your sweetheart of the pines
I'll always be your little sweetheart of the pines
Now you searched the dark side of the  mountain
Just to find what you thought true love  should be
But you found a heart that you never knew ??
When you got around to the other side of  me.
Well, I seen a whole lot of pain  and trouble
In this lonesome love of mine
But you gave me love and you gave it double
And I'll always be your sweetheart of the pines
I'll always be your little sweetheart of the pines.

Now you make me feel lovesick darlin'
The way I did back when my heart was young
But I'm young enough to start all over
And old enough to show you how it's done
Well, I seen a whole lot of pain  and trouble
In this lonesome life of mine
But you gave me love and you gave it double
And I'll always be your sweetheart of the pines
I'll always be your little sweetheart of the pines
