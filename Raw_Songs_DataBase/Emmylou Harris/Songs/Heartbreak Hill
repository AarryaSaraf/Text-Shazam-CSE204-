Long long time ago when we were young
You swore to me I would be the one
I would be the one you loved
But we had to part
You asked me to wait for you
To keep you in my heart
To keep you in my heart

Night after lonely night i'm waiting for you still
High above the lights of town here on Heartbreak Hill

Now maybe I am the foolish kind to think of you so long
Have you found another love
Am I still the one
Am I still the one for you
But you're far away
Do you ever dream of coming back to me someday
Back to me someday

Night after lonely night i'm waiting for you still
High above the lights of town here on Heartbreak Hill

On Heartbreak Hill alone at night
I think of how you held  me tight
And wonder if I ever will see you again
On Heartbreak Hill

Oh Lord if I only could go back in time enough
I'd hold you in my arms again
Never let you go
Never let you go my love
And leave me far behind
High upon this lonely hill were you swore to be mine
You swore to be mine

Night after lonely night i'm waiting for you still
High above the lights of town here on Heartbreak Hill
Night after lonely night i'm waiting for you still
High above the lights of town here on Heartbreak Hill
Here on Heartbreak Hill
Here on Heartbreak Hill
