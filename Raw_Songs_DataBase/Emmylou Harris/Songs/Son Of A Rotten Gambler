And his love will be his vision
And he'll take you where you stand
And will you stand your life by his
And help the boy become a man

And he'd be the son of his father his father the teacher
Teaching love and honesty being his own man handler
For the son of  the son of run of the mill run
Rotten gambler

Will the devil be getting to you as you look back
Over what you've done
And what you've done was it for reason or rhyme
Was it just for fun

And he'd be the son of his father his father the teacher
Teachin' love and honesty being his own man handler
For the son of  the son of run of the mill run
Rotten gambler

Back on the road now you can lose your head
There ain't no kingdom for the gambling man
You know the road now and you've made your stand
When his eyes shine upon you shine upon you

And he'd be the son of his father his father the teacher
Teaching love and honesty being his own man handler
For the son of  the son of run of the mill run
Rotten gambler

Back on the road now you can lose your head
There ain't no kingdom for the gambling man
You know the road now and you've made your stand
When his eyes shine upon you shine upon you

And he'd be the son of his father his father the teacher
Teaching love and honesty being his own man handler
or the son of  the son of run of the mill run
Rotten gambler
