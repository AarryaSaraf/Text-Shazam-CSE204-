Who can tell just how it starts
Angry words and broken hearts
Till silently we sit apart
You and I
But in awhile the anger's gone
And we forget who's right or wrong
Then one of us will end it all
With just a smile

We believe in happy endings
Never breaking
Only bending
Taking time enough for mending
The hurt inside

We believe in new beginnings
Giving in
And forgiving
We believe happy endings
You and I

Just a word is all it takes
And so it pass
The silence breaks
And looking back it makes us ache
For what we've done

And so we cling together now
And wonder why we're oh so proud
When all that matters anyhow
Is our love

We believe in happy endings
Never breaking
Only bending
Taking time enough for mending
The hurt inside

We believe in new beginnings
Giving in
And forgiving
We believe in happy endings
You and I
