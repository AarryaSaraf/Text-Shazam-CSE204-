We use to have good times together dear
But now I feel them slip away
It makes me cry to see love die
So sad to watch good love go bad

Remember how you used to feel  dear
you said nothing could change your mind
It breaks my heart to see us part
so sad to watch good love go bad

Is it any wonder that I'm feeling so blue
when I know for certain that I'm losing you
It breaks my heart to see us part
so sad to watch good love go bad

So sad to watch good love go bad
