On our wedding day did you lie
Did you know that someday you'd say goodbye
Now that you're gone another just won't do
I had my heart set on you
We were so young when we met
Sweet memories linger yet
You were the one who made my dreams come true
I had my heart set on you

As the years come and go does your heart mind
When you think of the girl you left behind
I still wear your ring 'cause when I said I do
I had my heart set on you
Oh darlin' I had my heart set on you
