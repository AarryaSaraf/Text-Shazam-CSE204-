You're free to go, darling
I'll break the ties that bind
Somehow the plans we made have gone astray
You're free to go, darling
So ease your worried mind
I'll never stand in your way

There's no ream of shining gold
So strong that it can hold
A heart that longs to be near
The lips are cold, darling
That once said yes to me
The tender love is gone, I  know
You're free to go

There's no ream of shining gold
So strong that it can hold
A heart that longs to be free
The lips are cold, darling
That once said yes to me
The tender love is gone, I know
You're free to go

The tender love is gone, I know
You're free to go
