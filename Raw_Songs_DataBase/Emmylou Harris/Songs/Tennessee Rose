Well it's a  sweet dream
That keeps me close to you dear
And it's a sad thing
That we're apart I'm blue dear
And there are times now
I thank the heavens up above

When I'm with the one that I love
Now there are diamonds
That some may long to  see
And they may shine
But not bright enough for me
I wouldn't take no

The whole world dipped in gold
For a night with my Tennessee Rose
Take this love that I am giving
For it's truly the lasting kind
The gift I hold is believing
That you will always be mine

Take this love that I am giving
For it's truly the lasting kind
The gift I hold is believing
That you will always be mine
Well it's a  sweet dream
That keeps me close to you dear

And it's a sad thing
That we're apart I'm blue dear
And there are times now
That heaven only knows
How I love my Tennessee Rose
Only my Tennessee Rose
