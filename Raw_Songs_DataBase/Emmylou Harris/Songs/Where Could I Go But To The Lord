Living below in this old sinful world
Hardly a comfort can afford
Striving alone to face temptations call
Where could I go  to the Lord

Where could I go  where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord

Neighbors are fun I love a_?em everyone
We get along in sweet accord
But when I pass the chilling hand of death
Where could I go  to the Lord

Where could I go  where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord

Life here is grand with friends I love so well
Comfort I get from God's own Word
But when my soul needs manna from above
Where could I go  to the Lord

Where could I go  where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord

Where could I go  where could I go
Seeking a refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to help me in the end
Where could I go to the Lord
Where could I go to the Lord
