I never thought that you'd be leavin' me
And even now it's so hard to believe
But even the blind at times can see the sun
And at least I know an ending when it comes

I may have missed a lot of things you said
I know most of them went right overhead
But with all my heart I know this song's been sung
And at least I know an ending when it comes

How long ago did you start leavin' me?
How long have I lived with a memory?
I may have missed it when you first begun
But at least I know an ending when it comes

Yes, even the blind at times can see the sun
And at least I know an ending when it comes
