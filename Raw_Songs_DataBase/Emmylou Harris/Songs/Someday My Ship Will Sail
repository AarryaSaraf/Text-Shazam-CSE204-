Life is just a passing moment
On an neverending trail
Though my pathway wanders for a heart
Someday my ship will sail

But I will walk this road awhile
And I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied

There's eternity before me
Just beyond the dark'ning veil
O my spirit hollers to go on
Someday my ship will sail

But I will walk this road awhile
And I will walk it with a smile
I will take it in my stride
Someday I'll be satisfied
Someday I'll be satisfied
