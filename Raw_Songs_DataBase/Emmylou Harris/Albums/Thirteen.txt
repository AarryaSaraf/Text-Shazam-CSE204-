Album: Thirteen

// Mystery Train //

Train arrive 16 coaches long
Train arrive 16 coaches long
Well that long black train
Took my baby back home

Train train rolling round the bend
Train train rolling round the bend
Well it took my baby
Away from me again

Went down to the station
To meet my baby at the gate
Ask the station master
If her train is running late
He said no if your wait
on that old 44
I hate to tell you son
But that train don't stop her anymore

Train train rolling round the bend
Train train rolling round the bend
Well it took my baby
Away from me again

Heard that whistle blowing
It was the middle of the night
When I got down to the station
The train was rolling out of site

Mystery train rolling round the bend
Mystery train rolling round the bend
Well it took my baby
Away from me again

// You're Free To Go //

You're free to go, darling
I'll break the ties that bind
Somehow the plans we made have gone astray
You're free to go, darling
So ease your worried mind
I'll never stand in your way

There's no ream of shining gold
So strong that it can hold
A heart that longs to be near
The lips are cold, darling
That once said yes to me
The tender love is gone, I  know
You're free to go

There's no ream of shining gold
So strong that it can hold
A heart that longs to be free
The lips are cold, darling
That once said yes to me
The tender love is gone, I know
You're free to go

The tender love is gone, I know
You're free to go

// Sweethearts Of The Pines //

Well I used to roll and I used to ramble
Out on the wilder side of town
Every night I hear the  bright lights calling
I never thought I could ever settle down.
Well, I seen a whole lot of pain  and trouble
In this lonesome life of mine
But you gave me love and you gave it double
And I'll always be your sweetheart of the pines
I'll always be your little sweetheart of the pines
Now you searched the dark side of the  mountain
Just to find what you thought true love  should be
But you found a heart that you never knew ??
When you got around to the other side of  me.
Well, I seen a whole lot of pain  and trouble
In this lonesome love of mine
But you gave me love and you gave it double
And I'll always be your sweetheart of the pines
I'll always be your little sweetheart of the pines.

Now you make me feel lovesick darlin'
The way I did back when my heart was young
But I'm young enough to start all over
And old enough to show you how it's done
Well, I seen a whole lot of pain  and trouble
In this lonesome life of mine
But you gave me love and you gave it double
And I'll always be your sweetheart of the pines
I'll always be your little sweetheart of the pines

// Just Someone I Used To Know //

There's a picture that I carry
One we made sometime ago
When they ask who's in the picture with me
I say just someone I use to know

Just someone I use to spend some time with
Just a flame  that lost it's glow
And I don't tell them how lost I am without you
I say just someone I use to know

Just someone  I use to run around with
Just a friend from long ago
I don't tell them all the nights I  cry without you
I say just someone I use to know
I say just someone I use to know

// My Father's House //

Last night I dreamed that I was a child
Out where the pines grow wild and tall
I was trying to make it home through the forest
Before the darkness falls

I heard the wind rustling through the trees
And ghostly voices rose from the fields
I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path
With the devil snappin' at my heels

I broke through the trees, and there in the night
My father's house stood shining hard and bright
The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms
But I ran till I fell, shaking in his arms

I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart
Will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts
I got dressed, and to that house I did ride
From out on the road, I could see its windows shining in light

I walked up the steps and stood on the porch
A woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door
I told her my story, and who I'd come for
She said "I'm sorry, son, but no one by that name lives here anymore"

My father's house shines hard and bright
It stands like a beacon calling me in the night
Calling and calling, so cold and alone
Shining 'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned

// Lacassine Special //

O ye yaie mais rappelle toi
Petite fille tout les accroires
Les promesses ca tu m'as fait
Tu connais je merite pas ca
Tu m'as dit toi tu m'aimais
Chere mais aujourd'hui
Aujourd'hui t'es apres me quitter
Moi je connais ca me fait du mal

O ye yaie mais rapelle toi
Petite fille tout les promesse
Les accroires ca tu m'as fait
Tu connais je peux pas oublier
Que toi mais tu m'as dit
Chere toi tu serais venue
Tu serais venue mais avec moi
Catin a la maison

// Today I Started Loving You Again //

Today I started loving you again
I'm right back where I've really always been
got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again

What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I've cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And that crying time for me had just begun
Cause today I started loving you again

I'm right back where I've really always been
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again

// When I Was Yours //

In a lonely room waiting for the night to fall
I hear your voice in every whip-poor-will that calls
And it takes me back to a better place and a sweeter time
When I was yours and you were mine

As the shadows fall and the light grows dim I see your face
I close my eyes and feel the warmth of your embrace as I long for you
And for all those days when hearts entwined
When I was yours and you were mine
When I was yours and you were mine

When I was yours and you were mine
A truer love in Caroline
Ever waltzed across these  hills and danced beneath the stars
Life was sweeter than the flowers blooming on the vine
When I was yours and you were mine

So I lay my head
On a pillow soft and stained with tears
I cry for you through all the long and lonely years
But when I dream till the morning sun comes to shine
Then I'll be yours and you'll be mine

Yes I will go back to a better place and a sweeter time
When I was yours and you were mine

// I Had My Heart Set On You //

On our wedding day did you lie
Did you know that someday you'd say goodbye
Now that you're gone another just won't do
I had my heart set on you
We were so young when we met
Sweet memories linger yet
You were the one who made my dreams come true
I had my heart set on you

As the years come and go does your heart mind
When you think of the girl you left behind
I still wear your ring 'cause when I said I do
I had my heart set on you
Oh darlin' I had my heart set on you

// Your Long Journey //

God's given us years of happiness here
Now we must part
And as the angels come and call for you
The pains of grief tug at my heart

Oh my darling
My darling
My heart breaks as you take your long journey

Oh the days will be empty
The nights so long without you my love
And when God calls for you I'm left alone
But we will  meet in heaven above

Oh my darling
My darling
My heart breaks as you take your long journey

Fond memories I'll keep of happy ways
That on earth we trod
And when I come we will walk hand in hand
As one in Heaven in the family of God

Oh my darling
My darling
My heart breaks as you take your long journey
