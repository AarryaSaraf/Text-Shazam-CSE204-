Album: Trio

// The Pain Of Loving You //

Oh, the pain of loving you
Oh, the misery I go through
Never knowing what to do
Oh, the pain of loving you

You just can't stand to see me happy
Seems you hurt me all you can
Still I go on loving you
But I never understand

To love and hate at the same time
The line between the two is fine
The two have bound me heart and soul
So strong that I can't let you go

To love and hate at the same time
The line between the two is fine
The two have bound me heart and soul
So strong that I can't let you go

// Making Plans //

You say tomorrow you're going
It's so hard for me to believe
I'm making plans for the heartaches
'Cause you're making plans to leave

The tears for me will be falling
Like a tree shedding its leaves
I'm making plans for the tear drops
'Cause you're making plans to leave

You're making plans to forget me
I'm making plans to miss you
I'm getting ready ti grieve

I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave
I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave

// To Know Him Is To Love Him //

To know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do

I'll be good to him
I'll bring love to him
Everyone says there'll come a day
When I'll walk alongside of him
Yes just to know him
Is to love love love him
And I do

Why can't he see
How blind can he be
Someday he will see
That he was meant for me

To know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do

// Hobo's Meditation //

Tonight as I lay on the boxcar
Just waiting for a train to pass by
What will become of the hobo
When his time comes to die

There's a Master up yonder in heaven
Got a place that we might call our home
Will we have to work for a living
Or can we continue to roam

Will there be any freight trains in heaven
Any boxcars in which we might hide
Will there by any tough cops or brakemen
Will they tell us that we cannot ride

Will the hobo chum with the rich man
Will we always have money to spare
Will they have respect for the hobo
In that land that lies up there

// Wildflowers //

The hills were alive with wildflowers
And I was as wild, even wilder than they
For at least I could run, they just died in the sun
And I refused to just wither in place

Just a wild mountain rose, needing freedom to grow
So I ran fearing not where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow

And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close, I had no room for growth
I wanted so much to branch out

I uprooted myself from home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow

I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone
So the garden, one day, set me free

Hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
I just let him decide where we'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow

// Telling Me Lies //

They say a woman's a fool for weeping
A fool to break her own heart
But I can't hold the secret I'm keeping
I'm breaking apart

Can't seem to mind my own business
Whatever I try turns out wrong
I seem like my own false witness
And I can't go on

I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies

You told me you needed my company
And I believed in your flattering ways
You told me you needed me forever
Nearly gave you the rest of my days

Should've seen you for what you are
Should never have come back for more
Should've locked up all my silver
Brought the key right to your door

I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies

You don't know what a chance is
Until you have to seize one
You don't know what a man is
Until you have to please one

Don't put your life in the hands of a man
With a face for every season
Don't waste your time in the arms of a man
Who's no stranger to treason

I cover my ears, I close my eyes
Still hear your voice and it's telling me lies
Telling me lies

// My Dear Companion //

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
I hear he's gone to come far country
And that he cares no more for me

I wish I were a swallow flying
I'd fly to a high and lonesome place
I'd join the wild birds in their crying
Thinking of you and your sweet face

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me
But now the stars have turned against me
And he cares no more for me

Oh when the dark is on the mountain
And all the world has gone to sleep
I will go down to the cold waters
And there I'll lay me down and weep

Oh have you seen my dear companion
For he was all this world to me

// Those Memories Of You //

Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you my little darling
Until the day they lay me down

In dreams of you my body trembles
I wake up and call your name
But you're not there, and I'm so lonesome
Without your love I'd go insane

Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you my little darling
Until the day they lay me down

I close my eyes and you're there with me
Your kiss I feel, your face I see
It's not your lips now that drive me crazy
It's just your haunting memory

Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you my little darling
Until the day they lay me down

Until the day they lay me down

// I've Had Enough //

Love it's not I who didn't try
Hard enough, hard enough
And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough

Love you don't see
The pain in me
That's plain enough, plain enough
You're never here to catch the tears
I cried for us, I cried for us

I'll take my share but I'll be fair
There's not much stuff
Easy enough
And if you choose I'll break the news
This part is tough, so very tough

I've tried and tried to put aside
The time to talk, but without luck
So I'll just pin this note within your coat
And leave the garden gate unlocked

And this is why I'm saying goodbye
I've had enough, I've had enough

// Rosewood Casket //

There's a little rosewood casket
Resting on a marble stand
With a packet of old love letters
Written by my true love's hand

Go and bring them to me, sister
Read them o'er for me tonight
I have often tried by could not
For the tears that filled my eyes

When I'm dead and in my casket
When I gently fall asleep
Fall asleep to wake in heaven
Dearest sister do not weep

Take his letters and his locket
Place them gently on my heart
But this golden ring that he gave me
From my finger never part

When I'm dead and in my casket
When I gently fall asleep
Fall asleep to wake in heaven
Dearest sister do not weep

// Farther Along //

Tempted and tried, we're oft made to wonder
Why it should be thus all day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested though in the wrong

When death has come and taken our loved ones
It leaves our home so lonely and drear
Then do we wonder why others prosper
Living so wicked year after year

Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother, live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all, by and by

Faithful 'til death, said our loving Master
A few more days to labor and wait
Toils of the road will then seem as nothing
As we sweep through the beautiful gates
