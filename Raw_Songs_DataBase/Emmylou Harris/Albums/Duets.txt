// Green Pastures //

Troubles and trials often betray those
On in the weary body to stray
But we shall walk beside the still waters
With the Good Shepherd leading The Way

Those who have strayed were sought by The Master
He who once gave His life for the sheep
Out on the mountain still He is searching
Bringing them in forever to keep

Going up home to live in green pastures
Where we shall live and die never more
Even The Lord will be in that number
When we shall reach that Heavenly Shore

We will not heed the voice of the stranger
For he would lead us to despair
Following on with Jesus our savior
We shall all reach that country so fair

Going up home to live in green pastures
Where we shall live and die never more
Even The Lord will be in that number
When we shall reach that Heavenly Shore

// Evangeline //

She stands on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Alone in the pale moonlight
Waitin' for a man, a riverboat gambler
Said that he'd return tonight

They used to waltz on the banks of the mighty Mississippi
Lovin' the whole night through
He was a riverboat gambler off to make a killin'
And bring it on back to you

Evangeline Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away

Bayou Sam from South Louisian'
Had gamblin' in his veins
Evangeline from the maritime
Was slowly goin' insane

High on the top of a Hickory Hill
She stands in the lightning and thunder
Down on the river the boat was a sinkin'
She watched that Queen go under

Evangeline Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away

Evangeline Evangeline
Curses the soul of the Mississippi Queen
That pulled her man away

// If I Needed You //

If I needed you
Would you come to me
Would you come to me
For to ease my pain
If you needed me
I would come to you
I would swim the seas
For to ease your pain

Well the night's forlorn
And the morning's born
And the morning shines
With the lights of love
And you'll miss sunrise
If you close your eyes
And that would break
My heart in two

If I needed you
Would you come to me
Would you come to me
For to ease my pain
If you needed me
I would come to you
I would swim the seas
For to ease your pain

Baby's with me now
Since I showed her how
To lay
Her lilly
Hand in mine
Who would ill agree
She's a sight to see
A treasure for
The poor to find

If I needed you
Would you come to me
Would you come to me
For to ease my pain
If you needed me
I would come to you
I would swim the seas
For to ease your pain
