Album: QuarterMoonInATenCentTown

// Easy From Now On //

There he goes gone again
Same old story's gotta come to an end
Lovin' him was a one way street
But I'm gettin' off where the crossroads meet
It's a quarter moon in a ten cent town
Time for me to lay my heartaches down
Saturday night gonna make myself a name
Take a month of sundays to try and explain

It's gonna be easy to fill
The heart of a thirsty woman
Harder to kill the ghost of a no good man
And I'll be ridin' high in a fandangled sky
It's gonna be easy; It's gonna be easy from now on

Raw as whip but clean as a bone
Soft to touch when you take me home
When the mornin' comes and it's time for me to leave
Don't worry 'bout me, I got a wild card up my sleeve

It's gonna be easy to fill
The heart of a thirsty woman
Harder to kill the ghost of a no good man
And I'll be ridin' high in a fandangled sky
It's gonna be easy, It's gonna be easy
It's gonna be easy from now on

// Two More Bottles Of Wine //

We came out west together with a common desire
The fever we had migtha set the west coast on fire
Two months later got trouble in mind
My baby moved out and left me behind
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine

The way he left sure turned my head around
Seemed like overnight she just up and put me down
Ain't gonna let it bother me today
I been workin' and I'm too tired anyway
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine
I'm sixteen hundred miles from the people I know
Been doin' all I can but opportunity sure come slow
Lord I'd be in the sun all day
But I'm sweepin' out a warehouse in west L.A.
But it's all right 'cause it's midnight
And I got two more bottles of wine

// To Daddy //

Mama never seemed to miss the finer things of life
If she did she never did say so to daddy
She never wanted to be more than a mother and a wife
If she did she never did say so to daddy
The only thing that seemed to be important to her life
Was to make our house a home and make us happy
Mama never wanted any more than what she had
If she did she never did say so to daddy

He often left her all alone but she didn't mind the staying home
If she did she never did say so to daddy
And she never missed the flowers and the cards he never sent her
If she did she never did say so to daddy
Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
And she didn't need those things to make her happy
And she didn't seem to notice that he didn't kiss and hold her
If she did she never did say so to daddy

One morning we awoke just to find a note
That mama carefully wrote and left to daddy
And as we began to read it
Our ears could not believe it
The words that she had written there to daddy

She said the kids are older now they don't need me very much
And I've gone in search of love I need so badly
I have needed you so long but I just can't keep holding on
She never meant to come back home
If she did she never did say so to daddy
Goodbye to daddy

// My Songbird //

Songbird in a golden cage
She'd prefer the blue
How I crave the liquor of her song
Poor bird who has done no harm
What harm could she do
She shall be my prisoner her lifelong

My songbird wants her freedom
Now don't you think I know
But I can't find it in myself
To let my songbird go
I just can't let her go

Oh Lord, when your jeweler's eye
Peers into my soul
Oh Lord, I am overcome with shame
Take me, Lord, and purify
Heal me with a word
Oh, I beg a gift I dare not claim

My songbird wants her freedom
Now don't you think I know
But I can't find it in myself
To let my songbird go
I just can't let her go

// Leaving Louisiana In The Broad Daylight //

Mary took to running with a travelin' man
Left her momma crying with her head in her hands
Such a sad case, so broken hearted
She say momma, I got to go, I gotta get outta here
I gotta get out of town; I'm tired of hanging around
I gotta roll on between the ditches

It's just an ordinary story 'bout the way things go
Round and around nobody knows, but the highway
Goes on forever, that 'ol highway rolls on forever
Lord she never would've done it if she hadn't got drunk

If she hadn't started running with a travelin man

If she hadn't started taking those crazy changes
She say daughter, let me tell you 'bout the travelin kind
Everywhere he's goin' such a very short time
He'll be long gone before you know it, he'll be long
Gone before you know it
She say never have I known it when it felt so good
Never have I knew it when I knew I could
Never have I done it when it looked so right
Leaving Louisiana in the broad daylight

This is down in the swampland, anything goes
It's alligator bait and the bars don't close
It's the real thing down in Louisiana

Did you ever see a cajun when he really got mad
When he really got trouble like a daughter gone bad
It gets real hot down in Louisiana

The stranger better move it or he's gonna get killed
He's gonna have to get it or a shotgun will
It ain't no time for lengthy speeches
There ain't no time for lengthy speeches
She say never have I know it when it felt so good
Never have I knew it when I knew I could
Never have I done it when it looked so right
Leaving Louisiana in the broad daylight
It's just an ordinary story 'bout the way things go
Round and around nobody knows, but the highway goes on forever
There ain't no way to stop the water

// Defying Gravity //

I live on a big blue ball
I never do dream I may fall
But even the day that I do
I jump off and smile back at you
I don't even know where we are

But they tell us we're circling a star
Well I'll take their word I don't know
But I'm dizzy so maybe that's so

I'm riding a big blue ball
I never do dream I may fall
But even the high may lay row
So when I do fall I'll be glad to go

// I Ain't Living Long Like This //

You looked for trouble and you found it son
Straight down the barrel of a lawman's gun
You'd try to run but you don't think you can
You make one move and you're dead man, friend
I ain't living long like this
I can't live at all like this, can I baby
He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back
Then he left me freezing on a steel rail track
They got 'em all in the jailhouse, ain't they bay
I ain't living long like this
grew up in Houston off of Wayside drive
Son of a charhop in some all night dive
Dad drove a stock car to an early death
All I remember was a drunk man's death
I ain't living long like this
I can't live at all like this can I baby

We know the story how the wheel goes round
Don't let 'em take you to the man downtown
Can't sleep at all in the jailhouse, baby
I ain't living long like this
You live for angel, she's a roadhouse queen
Make Texas ruby look like Sandra Dee
You want to love her but you don't know how
You're at the bottom of the jailhouse now
I ain't living long like this
I can't live at all like this, can I baby

You know the story 'bout the jailhouse rock
Go on and do it, but just don't get caught
They got 'em all in the jailhouse, ain't they baby
I ain't living long like this

// One Paper Kid //

Cowboys and indians and trees he could climb
Tomorrow came too fast but he didn't mind
The distance was short so light it again
It don't take no time to get where I am
But one paper kid wasn't really so mean
Just a little bit scarred and a little bit green
And he'd heard of a place it was legal to dream
So he sat with his coffee in a blue Texas wind
And he wrote on a rock
The one paper kid is rollin' again

Driver was drunk or he just didn't see
The future is there it'll happen to me
And all the time that he wasted was his once again
Ah, it never takes long to get where you've been
Broken hearts scattered all over the past
Old bad memories trying to last
Whiskey and women and growing up fast
Fussing and loving and itching like grass
Hell that one paper kid wasn't really so mean
Just a little bit weird cause times were so lean
Now he's gone to a place where it's legal to dream
No camels no coffee no cold morning winds
It was wrote on a rock
The one paper kid is rollin' again

// Green Rolling Hills //

The green rolling hills of West Virginia
Are the nearest thing to heaven that I know
Though the times are sad and drear
And I cannot linger here
They'll keep me and never let me go

My daddy said don't ever be a miner
For a miner's grave is all you'll ever own
'Cause the hard times everywhere
I can't find a dime to spare
These are the worst times I've ever known

So I'll move away into some crowded city
In some northern factory town you'll find me here
Though I'll leave the past behind
I'll never change my mind
These trouble times are more than I can bear

But someday I'll go back to west Virginia
To the green rolling hills I love so well
Yes someday I'll go home
And I know I'll right the wrong
These trouble times will follow me no more

Yes someday I'll go home
And I know I'll right the wrong
These trouble times will follow me no more

// Burn That Candle //

Keep that candle burnin' bright, mama
I'll be kind of late tonight, mama
There's a yellow moon above me, mama
Shinin' on the one I love, mama
Burn that candle
Night and day
Burn that candle
Honey light our way
Keep that doorway open wide
Until we come slowly strollin' side by side
While that candle's shinin' high, mama
I'll be with my sugar pie, mama

We'll be comin' home you know and mama
Lookin' for that candle glowin', mama
After we have had the wedding, mama
To that candle we'll be headin', mama
So before we're winin' and dinin', mama
Keep that candle light a-shinin', mama
