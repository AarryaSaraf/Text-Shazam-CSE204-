// Just Between The Two Of Us //

Just between the two of us we know our love is gone
People think it's wonderful our love can be so true
You never say an angry word no matter what I do
And you have so much faith in me you trust me anywhere
But the reason if they only knew is that we just don't care

Just between the two of us let's give up this fantasy
For we no longer care enough to even disagree
Everybody envies us and the way we get along
But just between the two of us we know our love is gone

Wish we could go back again to days that used to be
We fought a lot but even then I knew you cared for me
Now we get along so well, no teardrops ever fall
But there's no love, no anything, there's nothing left at all

Just between the two of us let's give up this fantasy
For we no longer care enough to even disagree
Everybody envies us and the way we get along
But just between the two of us we know our love is gone

// A House Without Love Is Not A Home //

For years we both have lived on pride dear
And we agree that love is gone
Why, oh why do we keep trying
A house without love is not a home

The simple things have gone forever
We wanted wealth to call our own
We slaved to gain a worthless treasure
A house without love is not a home

No matter where our footsteps wander
I know we'll both be all alone
With the pride that came between us
A house without love is not a home

The simple things have gone forever
We wanted wealth to call our own
We slaved to gain a worthless treasure
A house without love is not a home

// Slowly But Surely //

Slowly but surely I'm falling in love
Falling in love with you
Slowly but surely you're winning my heart
And you're winning my heart too

Slowly but surely I'm losing my heart
And I'm losing my heart to you
Slowly but surely my dreams will come true
If I spend my lifetime with you

You're just what I wanted
You're just what I needed
You're my every dream come true
My life's growing stronger
I can't wait much longer
I'm falling in love with you

Slowly but surely I'm falling in love
Falling in love with you
Slowly but surely my dreams will come true
If I spend my lifetime with you

You're just what I wanted
You're just what I needed
You're my every dream come true
My life's growing stronger
I can't wait much longer
I'm falling in love with you
Yes, I'm falling in love with you

// Our Hearts Are Holding Hands //

We're far apart but our hearts are holding hands

It's lonely just to sit here by myself each night
Not knowing when I'll ever get to hold you tight
Oh yes, I have temptations and sometimes it's pretty rough
But temptation's never strong as our sweet love

'Cause our hearts are holding hands across the miles
Even though we're lonely we can smile
'Cause I know you're my woman and I know you're my man
We're far apart but our hearts are holding hands

Today a stranger looked my way and flashed his gold
And said he'd buy me all the treasures I could hold
But I took out your last letter that said you love me so
And there I found the strenght to tell him no

'Cause our hearts are holding hands across the miles
Even though we're lonely we can smile
'Cause I know you're my woman and I know you're my man
We're far apart but our hearts are holding hands
And come what may our hearts are holding hands

// I Wanta Live Again //

We stopped living when our love died and I wanta live again

Our love grew cold a long time ago we both know love is gone
Yet we stay together, we just keep hanging on
But it's wrong to live together when our love has reached an end
We stopped living when our love died and I wanta live again

I wanna be kissed like I used to be
Thrilled like I used to be
Loved like I used to be
I wanta live again

Each time we kiss we search for love that used to fill our hearts
But it's all wrong the thrill is gone, we're just too far apart
We live a life of loneliness each day that we pretend
We stopped living when our love died and I wanta live again

I wanna be kissed like I used to be
Thrilled like I used to be
Loved like I used to be
I wanta live again

// Forever And Ever //

Forever and ever I'll love you
I swear by the stars up above you
There never will be any other
I'll love you forever and ever

The sun in the sky may stop shining
And the salty old sea may run dry
The man in the Moon may stop smiling
But I'll always be by your side

Forever and ever I'll love you
I swear by the stars up above you
There never will be any other
I'll love you forever and ever

No other lips ever will kiss me
No other arms ever will hold me
No other heart ever will miss me
I'll love you forever and ever

Forever and ever I'll love you
I swear by the stars up above you
There never will be any other
I'll love you forever and ever

// That Makes Two Of Us //

Far to sense you'd up and leave that's what you say
Don't you know that the road can run both ways
Well, I'm so sure before each other we're all wrong
And I'm tired of always trying to get along

Well, that makes two of us you're not the only one
Like you I've had enough, the end has now began
I guess I'm just as tired of you as you say you are of me
And that makes two of us, we both want to be free

I'm all through with trying to make the gold of us
And I've given up on giving in so much
As far as I'm concerned it's over but to pack
I could walk away and never once look back

Well, that makes two of us you're not the only one
Like you I've had enough, the end has now began
I guess I'm just as tired of you as you say you are of me
And that makes two of us, we both want to be free
And that makes two of us, we both want to be free

// I'll Take A Chance //

If you don't want to run around
If you wanna settle down
I'll take a chance on loving you
If you will be my very own
If you'll be mine and mine alone
I'll take a chance on loving you

There's a lotta pretty girls in this wide wide world
But none of them should hold a life to you
You're the nicest, the neatest, the cutest and the sweetest
And I'll tell you what I'm gonna do

If you don't want to run around
If you wanna settle down
I'll take a chance on loving you
If you will be my very own
If you'll be mine and mine alone
I'll take a chance on loving you

Did you really mean it or did I just dream it
When you said I was the one for you
Too late to forget it, too late to regret it
That day that I fell in love with you

If you don't want to run around
If you wanna settle down
I'll take a chance on loving you
If you will be my very own
If you'll be mine and mine alone
I'll take the chance on loving you

// Stranger In My Arms //

I don't thrill you like I used to do, there's something on your mind
Now you treat me cold instead of warm
And you're not just not the same old you that I used to call mine
And you feel like a stranger in my arms

When I hold you close to me you still seem far away
I tried my best to bring you back but something's in the way
And even when I'm kissing you I'm missing all your charms
And you feel like a stranger in my arms

I don't see the love light in your eyes for me no more
The flame is cold that used to burn so warm
There's a strangeness in your ways I'd never known before
And you feel like a stranger in my arms

When I hold you close to me you still seem far away
I tried my best to bring you back but something's in the way
And even when I'm kissing you I'm missing all your charms
And you feel like a stranger in my arms
And you feel like a stranger in my arms

// Too Used To Being With You //

Too used to that certain someone
To offer my love to anyone new
My excuse for not wanting no one
Too used to being with you

Some other's arms may hold and caress you
Some other's lips may burn on my own
That's why your eyes are filled with their beauty
My heart inside will be crying alone

Too used to that certain someone
To offer my love to anyone new
My excuse for not wanting no one
Too used to being with you

When you find a true love you treasure
Other affairs are just to pass time
You'll find their love just a cheap imitation
The love they offer's not real genuine

Too used to that certain someone
To offer my love to anyone new
My excuse for not wanting no one
Too used to being with you
Too used to being with you

// So Much For Me, So Much For You //

So much for me, so much for you

Oh, how hard we fought today behind that courtroom door
Deviding up the things we both had worked together for
Now we go our seperate ways, the ties no longer bind
So much will belong to you and so much will be mine

It's over now, the paper's signed
What once was ours is yours or mine
But don't forget to divide the heartaches too
So much for me, so much for you

We signed our names and thanked the judge and walked out in the hall
Too confused to realize the reason for it all
We should have fought as hard to make our love grow fine and strong
As we have fought to prove which one of us was right or wrong

It's over now, the paper's signed
What once was ours is yours or mine
But don't forget to divide the heartaches too
So much for me, so much for you

// Wait A Little Longer, Please Jesus //

Here the labor is so hard and the workers they are tired
And our weary hearts're yearning for a rest
And I find we're getting anxious to be in that happy home
Where we'll receive such peace and happiness

But wait a little longer, please Jesus
There are so many wandering out in sin
Just a little longer, please Jesus
A few more days to get our loved ones in

Family scattered here and there and thought Lord we love them dear
Maybe we can help them find a way
But if waiting is the cost, dear ol' Lord then I'll be lost
And that's the only reason why we say

Wait a little longer, please Jesus
There are so many wandering out in sin
Just a little longer, please Jesus
A few more days to get our loved ones in
A few more days to get our loved ones in
