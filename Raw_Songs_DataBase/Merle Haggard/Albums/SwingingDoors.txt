// If I Could Be Him //

We're all friends you and I me and him
And it's wrong to want you like I do
And no way can wrong be right but I'd give the world tonight
If I could just be him holding you
I know that you could never trade his love for mine
And I know my dreams can never be
Cause no way can wrong be right but I'd give the world tonight
If I could just be him instead of me
I can see everything in you I ever dreamed of
But someone I call my friend stands in the way
I'd give everything I own for one hour with you alone
Or if I could just be him for just one day
I can see everything in you...

// The Longer You Wait //

The longer you wait to leave me the longer I'll hurt when you're gone
And the longer it takes you to break my heart the longer the pain lingers on
How long will you prolong my misery wish I could leave on my own
Cause the longer you wait to leave me the longer I'll hurt when you're gone
We both know that you never loved me I lied to myself from the start
We both know that someday you'll leave me and the knowin' just tears me apart
How long will you prolong my misery...
The longer I'll hurt when you're gone

// I'll Look Over You //

I'll look over things you do because I love you so,
And I'll be standing on the sidelines while you play.
It's your life to live the way you want to live,
And I'll look over you if you'll just let me stay.

It's no fault of yours if I can't give the thrill you need,
And I know someday you'll find someone who can.
Though it hurts to see you stare at every guy you see,
I'll look over you and try to understand.

I'll look over things you do because I love you so,
And I'll be standing on the sidelines while you play.
It's your life to live the way you want to live,
And I'll look over you if you'll just let me stay.

// I Can't Stand Me //

I can't stand me since I lost you and I can't stand nobody else
I can't stand me since you went away and I gotta get away from myself

I used to be a high-stepper with a lot on the ball my friends all called me Ace 
It took a woman like you to bring a good man down
And make me ashamed to even show my face
I can't stand me since I lost you...
[steel]
Oh when I look in the glass and see a grown man cry it makes me wanna hang my head
I used to feel real proud just to be alive but now I think I'd rather be dead
I can't stand me since I lost you...
[guitar]
I'm gonna find me a river about ten miles wide with a bridge right all way cross
I'm gonna drag myself about half way over and then I'm gonna throw me off
I can't stand me since I lost you...
Yeah I gotta get away from myself

// The Girl Turned Ripe //

Well the girl turned ripe and the pickers came today
Had an uncle who was farmin' down in Tennessee
And I stopped by to see him there brought this friend with me 
He had a daughter seventeen whose name was Clementine
And sure enough they fell in love her and this friend of mine
He said the girl turned ripe and the pickers came today
He said there ain't no need in me beggin' her to stay
Ol' uncle Dave just shook his head and turned away
He said the girl turned ripe and the pickers came today
Fell in love with a gal that made her home in Louisian'
And her daddy was a hard and strict but very humble man
And he shook me up that day I went to ask him for her hand
But I felt better when I heard them same old words again
Well the girl turned ripe and the pickers came today
Said there ain't no need in me beggin' her to stay
He just shook his head and slowly walked away
He said the girl turned ripe and the pickers came today
Now me and this gal from Louisian' we got a family
We got a little doll with big brown eyes that we call Charmarie
And there's a great long line of pickers waitin' to talk to me
About the sweet little gal of mine that we call Charmarie
Well I said the girl turned ripe...
I said the girl turned ripe and the pickers came today

// The Bottle Let Me Down //

Each night I leave the bar room when it's over
Not feeling any pain at closing time
But tonight your memory found me much too sober
Couldn't drink enough to keep you off my mind 

Tonight the bottle let me down
And let your memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let me down

I've always had a bottle I could turn to
And lately I've been turnin' every day
But the wine don't take effect the way it used to
And I'm hurtin' in old familiar ways 

Tonight the bottle let me down
and let your memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let me down 

Tonight the bottle let me down

// No More You And Me //

Today something told me not to call you
But with trembling hands I dialed the telephone
And as it rang the seventh time
I knew I'd lost what once was mine
There'll be no more you and me from now on
There'll be no more you and me there'll be only misery
Cause you and him me and loneliness but no more you and me
I don't have to see his arms wrapped around you
To know you've chosen him instead of me
But just to know you'd be with him I called the place you'd been
I had to verify the thing I couldn't see
There'll be no more you and me...

// Somebody Else You've Known //

I've always been the kinda guy that didn't love a lot
I took all the love they offered me with ease
And it didn't make much difference if they loved me or not
Cause I'd love 'em for a while then I'd leave
Yeah I can't believe it's really me hurtin' like I do
Just because you left me all alone
I've seen it happen many times to other guys you knew
Surely I must be somebody else you've known
Well when I first met you darling you impressed me more than some
I should have took the warning way back then
But I never stopped to think it that even my day had to come
And like the other guys I want you back again
Yeah I can't believe it's really me...
Surely I must be somebody else you've known

// High On A Hilltop //

High on a hilltop overlooking a city
I can see the bright lights as they gleam
And somewhere you're dancing in some dingy bar room
And the lure of the gay life takes the place of our dream

High on a hilltop my heart cries, Oh Lord
Forgive her she knows not the way
And give me the power to believe and some day
High on a hilltop together we'll pray

I can vision a rounder with a line so smooth
And a promise of riches for you
But you see not the danger cause you're silly with booze
And high on a hilltop I see a devil in you

[Refrain]

// This Town's Not Big Enough //

Today's the day I leave forever
This town where we once loved together
Now that love is gone I guess I'm free
I'll leave behind both you and sorrow

And take just what I'll have tomorrow
When there's miles and miles and miles
Between this town and me
This town's not big enough for both of us to be

I can't go anywhere without your memory
In every window pane your face is all I see
This town's not big enough to hold both you and me
I'll drop the dreams I've held so tightly
Shed my tears and travel lightly

Anything to ease my heavy load
I'll find a town in far-off places
Where the windows have no faces
Many miles from anywhere along this lonely road

This town's not big enough

// Shade Tree (Fix-It-Man) //

Yeah I'm a shade tree fix-it man I don't need any helping hand
I'm a Jack-of-all-trades when I'm workin' in their shade
I'm a shade tree-fix-it man
Well I headed outa west from Arkansas my Ruby ran fine for a while
Then a rock started knockin' a guage started rockin' she wouldn't run another mile
But on that downhill drag I coasted for awhile till I found me a shady inn
I started huffin' and a puffin' started a frettin' and a sweatin'
But I soon had her runnin' again
Cause I'm a shade tree fix-it man...
Bout noon the next day I was back on the road I had her runnin' on out
While I was wheelin' and a dealin' I got a funny feelin'
If my baby kinda felt this doubt
Oh I found me a shade by the side of the road I fixed everything up fine
With a little bit of lovin' in a few minutes later we was rolling on down the line
Cause I'm a shade tree fix-it man...
One more time I'm a shade tree fix-it man...
Yeah I'm a shade tree fix-it man...
