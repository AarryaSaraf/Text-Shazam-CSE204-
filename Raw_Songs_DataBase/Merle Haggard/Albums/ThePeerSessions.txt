// Peach Picking Time In Georgia //

When it's peach picking time in Georgia apple picking time in Tennessee
Cotton picking time in Mississippi everybody picks on me
And when it's roundup time in Texas the cowboys make whoopee
And way on down in Alabama it's gal picking time to me
Yodel le-ee oh le-ee oh de oh le-ee.

There's a bluegrass down in Kentucky Virginia's where they do the swing
And Carolina now I'm coming to you to spend the spring
Arkansas I hear you calling I know I'll see you soon
And there's where we'll do a little picking underneath the Ozark moon
Yodel le-ee oh le-ee oh de oh le-ee.

When all the pickers picking cotton that's when I pick a wedding ring
We'll go downtown and buy wedding gown for the wedding in the spring
I hope the preacher knows his business I know he can't fool me
When it's peach picking time in Georgia it's gal picking time to me
Yodel le-ee oh le-ee oh de oh le-ee...

// Miss The Mississippi And You //

I'm growing tired of the big city lights
Tired of the glamour and tired of the sights
In all my dreams I am roaming once more
Back to my home on the old river shore

I am sad and weary far away from home
Miss the Mississippi and you, dear
Days are dark and dreary everywhere I roam
Miss the Mississippi and you

Rolling the wide world over
Always along and blue, so blue
Nothing seems to cheer me under heaven's dome
Miss the Mississippi and you

Memories are bringing happy days of yore
Miss the Mississippi and you, dear
Mocking birds are singing 'round the cabin door
Miss the Mississippi and you

Rolling the wide world over
Always alone and blue, blue
Longing for my homeland, muddy water shore
Miss the Mississippi and you

Mississippi and you

// Time Changes Everything //

There was a time when I thought of no other
And we sang our own love's refrain
And our hearts beat as one as we had our fun
But time changes everything

When you left me, my poor heart was broken
Our romance seemed all in vain
The dark clouds are gone and there's blue skies again
And time changes everything

Now time has passed, I've forgot you
Mother Nature does wonderful things
I guess that is true for me and for you
'Cause time changes everything

Oh you can change the name of an old song
Rearrange it and make it swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you
But time changes everything

So good luck to you, may God bless you
I can't say I won't love again
You've gone your way and I'll go mine
'Cause time has changed everything
