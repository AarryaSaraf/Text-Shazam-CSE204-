// What's Wrong With Stayin' Home //

The boys are wantin' me to go out drinking
They want me to leave my Julie home
I know Julie don't mind my drinking
But Julie don't like to be left here at home.

So what's wrong with stayin' home with Julie
Julie's always been good to me
What's wrong with stayin' home with Julie
Julie's always stayed at home with me.

I know she may be a bit old fashion
She don't wear all those fancy clothes
But at least they don't say bad things about her
And I'm proud of her everywhere we go.

So what's wrong with stayin' home with Julie
Julie's always been good to me
What's wrong with stayin' home with Julie
Julie's always stayed at home with me...

// Who Do I Know In Dallas //

Who do I know in Dallas
Who can I call on the phone
Who do I know in Dallas
Who'll make me forget she's gone.

I can's spend the night without someone
The loneliness will drive me insane
Who do I know in Dallas
Who'll make me glad I came.

It was Shirley consoled me in Phoenix
And Jeannie in old San Antone
But who do I know in Dallas
Who'll help me forget she's gone.

Oh, who do I know in Dallas
Who can I call on the phone
Who do I know in Dallas
Who'll make me forget she's gone...

// She Thinks I Still Care //

Just because I ask a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I rang her number by mistake today
She thinks I still care.

Just because I haunt the same old places
Where the mem'ry of her lingers ev'rywhere
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be
She thinks I still care.

But if she's happy thinkin' I still need her
Then let that silly notion bring her cheer
But how could she ever be so foolish
Oh where would she get such an idea.

Just because I ask a friend about her
And just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I saw her then went all to pieces
She thinks I still care.

She thinks I still care...

// Hungry Eyes //

A canvas covered cabin in a crowded labour camp
Stand out in this memory I revived;
Cause my daddy raised a family there, with two hard working hands
And tried to feed my mama's hungry eyes.

He dreamed of something better, and my mama's faith was strong
And us kids were just too young to realize
That another class of people put us somewhere just below;
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes.

Mama never had the luxuries she wanted
But it wasn't cause my daddy didn't try.
She only wanted things she really needed;
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes.

I remember daddy praying for a better way of life
But I don't recall a change of any size;
Just a little loss of courage, as their age began to show
And more sadness in my mama's hungry eyes.

Mama never had the luxuries she wanted
But it wasn't cause my daddy didn't try.
She only wanted things she really needed;
One more reason for my mama's hungry eyes.

Oh, I still recall my mama's hungry eyes.

// I Die Ten Thousand Times A Day //

I come home and I sat down by the door
I just sat and dream my lonely life away
I just can't stand a thought that I won't see you anymore
I guess I die ten thousand times a day.

If that soulful life comes to its end
I ceased to live the night you went away
If you walk through that door then I'll start to live again
I guess I die ten thousand times a day.

I pick up each thing you used to touch
I call to mine each tender word you say
If I've hurt you it's just because I love you much too much
I guess I die ten thousand times a day...

// Every Fool Has A Rainbow //

Every fool has rainbow
But he never seems to find
The reward that should be waiting
At the end of the line.

But he'll give up a bed of roses for
A life filled with thorns
And go chasing after rainbows
Everytime the dream is born.

And every fool has a rainbow
That only he can see
Every fool has a rainbow
And the rule replies to me.

And every fool has a rainbow
That only he can see
Every fool has a rainbow
And the rule replies to me...

// I Came So Close To Losing My Home //

I came close so close to failure
I came close to living alone
I know the kids still love me and their mama
But I came so close to losing my home.

I felt small enough to drown in each teardrop
But big enough to admit I was wrong
When I think of what I've done the cheer runs through me
'Cause I came so close to losing my home.

I felt small enough to drown in each teardrop
But big enough to admit I was wrong
When I think of what I've done the cheer runs through me
'Cause I came so close to losing my home.

I came so close to losing my home...

// Montego Bay //

I showed her most of Tennessee that's all I could afford
I even thought of stealing so I could show her more
But she never did seem happy and I often heard her say
Hey, I like it here but I love Montego Bay.

Oh, I should have gone with her at least I wouldn't know
What about Montego Bay that makes it pull so strong
All I've got's old mem'ries of the way she used to say
Hey, I like it here but I love Montego Bay.

Why couldn't I convince her, why couldn't I make her see
There's no way Montego Bay needs her more than me
When she left she seemed so happy I can still hear her say
Hey, I like it here but I love Montego Bay.

Why couldn't I convince her, why couldn't I make her see
There's no way Montego Bay needs her more than me
When she left she seemed so happy I can still hear her say
Hey, I like it here but I love Montego Bay...
