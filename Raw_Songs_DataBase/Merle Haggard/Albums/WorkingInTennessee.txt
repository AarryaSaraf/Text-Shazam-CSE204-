// Workin' Man Blues //

It's a big job gettin' by with nine kids and a wife
You know I've been a workin' man dang near all my life
I'll keep on working long as my two hands are fit to use
I drink my beer this evening and sing a little bit of these workin' man blues

Well, I keep my nose on the grindstone and I work hard every day
I might get a little high on the weekends, after I draw my pay
But I go back workin', I got to buy my kids a brand new pair of shoes
Well I drink a little beer in a tavern and I sing a little bit of them workin' man blues

Well, hey, hey, the working man, the working man like me
Never been on welfare and that's one place I'm not gonna be
I'd be workin' as long as my two hands are fit to use
I will drink my beer at a tavern and sing a little bit of them workin' man blues

Sometimes I think about leavin' and do a little bummin' around
I throw my bills out the window, catch a train to another town
But I go back workin', I got to buy my kids a brand new pair of shoes
I sing a little bit in a tavern and cry a little bit of these workin' man blues

Well, hey, hey, the working man, the working man like me
Never been on welfare and that's one place I'm not gonna be
I'd be workin' as long as my two hands are fit to use
I'd drink a little beer this evening and sing a little bit of them workin' man blues

This song goes out for all the working man there...
