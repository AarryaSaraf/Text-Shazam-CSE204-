The boys are wantin' me to go out drinking
They want me to leave my Julie home
I know Julie don't mind my drinking
But Julie don't like to be left here at home.

So what's wrong with stayin' home with Julie
Julie's always been good to me
What's wrong with stayin' home with Julie
Julie's always stayed at home with me.

I know she may be a bit old fashion
She don't wear all those fancy clothes
But at least they don't say bad things about her
And I'm proud of her everywhere we go.

So what's wrong with stayin' home with Julie
Julie's always been good to me
What's wrong with stayin' home with Julie
Julie's always stayed at home with me...
