Come and listen to a radio station where the mighty hosts of heaven sing
Turn your radio on, turn your radio on
If you want to hear the songs of Zion coming from the land of endless spring
Get in touch with God, turn your radio on

Turn your radio on and listen to the music in the air
Turn your radio on, heaven's glory share
Turn the lights down low and listen to the Master's radio
Get in touch with God, turn your radio on

Listen to the songs of the fathers and the mothers
And the many friends gone before, turn your radio on, turn your radio on
Some eternal morning we shall meet them over on the Hallelujah shore
Get in touch with God, turn your radio on

Turn your radio on and listen to the music in the air
Turn your radio on, heaven's glory share
Turn the lights down low and listen to the Master's radio
Get in touch with God, turn your radio on
