I came close so close to failure
I came close to living alone
I know the kids still love me and their mama
But I came so close to losing my home.

I felt small enough to drown in each teardrop
But big enough to admit I was wrong
When I think of what I've done the cheer runs through me
'Cause I came so close to losing my home.

I felt small enough to drown in each teardrop
But big enough to admit I was wrong
When I think of what I've done the cheer runs through me
'Cause I came so close to losing my home.

I came so close to losing my home...
