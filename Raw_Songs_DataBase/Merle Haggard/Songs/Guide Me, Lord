I was born in sin and lost but Jesus paid the cost
And pardoned me from all iniquity
So till I see His face I'll daily ask His grace
To guide me on the path He planned for me

Guide me Lord through the day, guide me Lord this I pray
Through all hardships temptation and strife
Guide me Lord through Thy might, guide me Lord by Thy light
That Thy will might be done in my life

God loved us everyone and He gave His only son
To save our souls from sin He gladly died
So trust in Him today and He'll wash your sins away
Then daily He will be your light and guide

Guide me Lord through the day, guide me Lord this I pray
Through all hardships temptation and strife
Guide me Lord through Thy might, guide me Lord by Thy light
That Thy will might be done in my life

Guide me, Lord
