It gets longer in between each time you call
I'd be safe in saying you no longer care at all
We're never seem together like we used to
Be tell me darling whatever happened to me

I once played a big part in your world 
Think back and I know you'll agree
You still play a big part in my world
Oh but whatever happened to me

I made up my own excuses for so long
I can't keep myself from asking what went wrong
Please forgive me if I'm just too blind to see
And tell me darling whatever happened to me

Please forgive me if I'm just too blind to see
And tell me darling whatever happened to me
