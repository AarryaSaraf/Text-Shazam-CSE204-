There was a time when I thought of no other
And we sang our own love's refrain
And our hearts beat as one as we had our fun
But time changes everything

When you left me, my poor heart was broken
Our romance seemed all in vain
The dark clouds are gone and there's blue skies again
And time changes everything

Now time has passed, I've forgot you
Mother Nature does wonderful things
I guess that is true for me and for you
'Cause time changes everything

Oh you can change the name of an old song
Rearrange it and make it swing
I thought nothing could stop me from loving you
But time changes everything

So good luck to you, may God bless you
I can't say I won't love again
You've gone your way and I'll go mine
'Cause time has changed everything
