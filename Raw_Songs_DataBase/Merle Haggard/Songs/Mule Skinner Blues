Good mornin' Captain good mornin' son
Do you need another mule skinner out on your new wood line
De yodel ei-ee-hee oh le-ee le-ee oh le-ee.

I like to work I'm rollin' all the time
I can carve my initials on your mule's behind
De yodel ei-ee-hee oh le-ee le-ee oh le-ee.

Here comes James Burton on the accustical guitar.

Oh pick it.

Hey, hey, little water boy hey bring your water round
If you don't like your job then set your bucket down
De yodel ei-ee-hee oh le-ee le-ee oh le-ee.

Here's Roy Nichols on the harmonica.

I'm going to town honey what you want me to bring you back
How about a pint of booze and a Johny B Stetson hat
De yodel ei-ee-hee oh le-ee le-ee oh le-ee.

Here's Norman Hamlet.

Hey, I smell your bread a burnin' woman turn your damper down
If you ain't got a damper good gal turn your bread around
Around I said around
De yodel ei-ee-hee oh le-ee le-ee oh le-ee...
