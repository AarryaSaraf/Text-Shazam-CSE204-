I don't thrill you like I used to do, there's something on your mind
Now you treat me cold instead of warm
And you're not just not the same old you that I used to call mine
And you feel like a stranger in my arms

When I hold you close to me you still seem far away
I tried my best to bring you back but something's in the way
And even when I'm kissing you I'm missing all your charms
And you feel like a stranger in my arms

I don't see the love light in your eyes for me no more
The flame is cold that used to burn so warm
There's a strangeness in your ways I'd never known before
And you feel like a stranger in my arms

When I hold you close to me you still seem far away
I tried my best to bring you back but something's in the way
And even when I'm kissing you I'm missing all your charms
And you feel like a stranger in my arms
And you feel like a stranger in my arms
