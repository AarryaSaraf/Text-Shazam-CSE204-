Steal away, steal away
Steal away to Jesus
Steal away, steal away home
I ain't got long to stay here

I was walkin' in Savannah, passed the church decayed and dimed
When there's slowly through the window came a plaintive funeral hymn
And a sympathy awakened an' a wonder quickly grew
Till I found myself seat in a little negro pew

Out at front a young couple sat in sorrow, nearly wild
And on the altar was a coffin and in the coffin lay a child
Rows of sad old negro preacher at his little wooden desk
With a manner grandly awkward with the countless grotesque

And he said now don't be weepin' for this little bit of clay
For the little boy who lived there he done gone and run away
He's was doin' very finely and he appreaciated your love
But it's sure enough father want him in the large house up above

Now he didn't give you that baby by a hundred thousand miles
He just think you need some sunshine and he lend it for awhile
He let you keep and love it till your hearts were bigger grown
And these silver tears you have shed that's just interest on the loan

So my poor dejected mourners let your hearts with Jesus rest
And don't go criticizein' no one the one that knows the best
He gives us many comforts he's ever right to take away
To the Lord be praised in glory now and ever, let us pray

My Lord calls me, He calls me by the thunder
The trumpet sounds within my soul
I ain't got long to stay here
