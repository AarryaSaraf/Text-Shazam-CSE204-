When the Savior calls I will answer
When He calls for me I will hear
When the Savior calls I will answer
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name

I'll be somewhere list'ning
I'll be somewhere list'ning
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name
I'll be somewhere list'ning
I'll be somewhere list'ning
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name

If my heart is right when He calls me
If my heart is right I will hear
If my heart is right when He calls me
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name

I'll be somewhere list'ning
I'll be somewhere list'ning
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name
I'll be somewhere list'ning
I'll be somewhere list'ning
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name

If my robe is white when He calls me
If my robe is white I will hear
If my robe is white when He calls me
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name

I'll be somewhere list'ning
I'll be somewhere list'ning
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name
I'll be somewhere list'ning
I'll be somewhere list'ning
I'll be somewhere list'ning for my name
