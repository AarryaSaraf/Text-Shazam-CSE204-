Who do I know in Dallas
Who can I call on the phone
Who do I know in Dallas
Who'll make me forget she's gone.

I can's spend the night without someone
The loneliness will drive me insane
Who do I know in Dallas
Who'll make me glad I came.

It was Shirley consoled me in Phoenix
And Jeannie in old San Antone
But who do I know in Dallas
Who'll help me forget she's gone.

Oh, who do I know in Dallas
Who can I call on the phone
Who do I know in Dallas
Who'll make me forget she's gone...
