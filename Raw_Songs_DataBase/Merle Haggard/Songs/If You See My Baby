If you see my baby while making your rounds
In some crowded nightspot or cafe in town
Tell her I miss her and I'm still around
If you see my baby in this lonesome old town.

Tell her to call me when she's all alone
'Cause I'm always waitin' by my telephone
I'd still worship the ground where she walks around
If you see my baby in this lonesome old town.

Tell her to call me when she's all alone
'Cause I'm always waitin' by my telephone
I'd still worship the ground where she walks around
If you see my baby in this lonesome old town...
