Now I want to think about tomorrow
When the happy times are gone away
Good times can't last forever
But the good times are here today.

And I want to talk about the leavin'
If you want to beg me to stay
I wanna live just for the moment
And everything is going my way.

And I want to think about tomorrow
When the happy times are gone away
Good times can't last forever
But the good times are here today.

I'm not gonna save any money
I'm gonna spend every dime I can
And I'll buy you everything that money can buy
While the good times are here at hand.

And I want to think about tomorrow
When the happy times are gone away
Good times can't last forever
But the good times are here today...
