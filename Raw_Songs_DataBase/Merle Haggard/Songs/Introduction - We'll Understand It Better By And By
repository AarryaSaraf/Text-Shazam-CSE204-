Trials dark on every hand
And we cannot understand
All the ways of God would lead us
To that blessed promised land
But he guides us with his eye
And we'll follow till we die
For we'll understand it better by and by

By and by, when the morning comes
When the saints of God are gathered home
We'll tell the story how we've overcome
For we'll understand it better by and by

Temptations, hidden snares
Often take us unawares
And our hearts are made to bleed
For a thoughtless word or deed
And we wonder why the test
When we try to do our best
But we'll understand it better by and by

By and by, when the morning comes
When the saints of God are gathered home
We'll tell the story how we've overcome
For we'll understand it better by and by
