Forever and ever I'll love you
I swear by the stars up above you
There never will be any other
I'll love you forever and ever

The sun in the sky may stop shining
And the salty old sea may run dry
The man in the Moon may stop smiling
But I'll always be by your side

Forever and ever I'll love you
I swear by the stars up above you
There never will be any other
I'll love you forever and ever

No other lips ever will kiss me
No other arms ever will hold me
No other heart ever will miss me
I'll love you forever and ever

Forever and ever I'll love you
I swear by the stars up above you
There never will be any other
I'll love you forever and ever
