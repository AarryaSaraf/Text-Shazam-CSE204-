When a woman gets the blues she hangs her little head and cries
When a woman gets the blues she hangs her little head and cries
But when a man gets blues he grabs him a train and rides.

I can't understand how come you do me like you do
I can't understand how come you do me like you do do do do do
Well if you don't want me woman so since I don't want you.

Looky yonder coming, coming down the railroad track
Looky yonder coming, coming down the railroad track
And see the black smoke rolling rolling from that old smoke stack.

De yodel le-ee ai-de yodel e-ee.

Hey, hey, hey

I feel so bad the whole round world looks blue
I feel so bad that the whole round world looks blue
I ain't got no money I don't know what to do.

Looky yonder coming, coming down the railroad track
Looky yonder coming, coming down the railroad track
And see the black smoke rolling rolling from that old smoke stack.

De yodel le-ee ai-de yodel e-ee...
