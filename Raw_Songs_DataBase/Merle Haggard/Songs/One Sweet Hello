One, sweet hello and one, sad goodbye
Two empty arms and these lonely nights to cry
Together it was heaven, but how quickly time did fly
With one, sweet hello and one, sad goodbye

These precious memories linger on
Haunting my mind since you're gone
These little things between us that really have no ties
Are all we have together and all we realize

Was one, sweet hello and one sad goodbye
Two, empty arms and these lonely nights to cry
Together it was heaven, but how quickly time did fly
With one, sweet hello and one, sad goodbye

Together it was heaven, but how quickly time did fly
With one, sweet hello and one, sad goodbye
