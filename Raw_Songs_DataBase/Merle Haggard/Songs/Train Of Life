I sit alone at my table and watch all the others have fun
And I'm tired of sittin' on the sidetrack, watchin' the mainline run
I'm tired of havin' no future, livin' on things that I've done
And I'm tired of sittin' on the sidetrack, watchin' the mainline run

Train, train, don't leave me
Oh, train, train of life

I got no one to call me their darling, to hug me and call me their hon
And I'm tired of sittin' on the sidetrack, watchin' the mainline run
I'm tired of havin' no future, just livin' on things that I've done
And I'm tired of sittin' on the sidetrack, watchin' the mainline run

Train, train, don't leave me
Oh, train, train of life

Train, train, don't leave me
Oh, train, train of life, train of life
