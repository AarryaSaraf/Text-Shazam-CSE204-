For years I've tried to leave this poor man's valley
On a train that's on its way to richer ground
Where rivers never overflow and dreams cannot be drowned
But the train never stops at our town

I'd like to buy a mansion for my darling
On a way upon a mountain looking down
I know there's a restless goal up there just waiting to be found
But the train never stops at our town

Failure has to find something to blame
And the only thing that's left is that old frame

The darkness of the night catches me crying
A whistle soon will blow a lonesome sound
A spark of hope becomes a flame each time the train slows down
But the train never stops at our town
That old train never stops at our town
