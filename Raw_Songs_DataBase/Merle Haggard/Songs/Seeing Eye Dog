Well, I'm gonna get me a seeing eye dog to help me find my way
I'm so much in love with you I can't even see the light of day
My mind is cloudy like a winter storm before the rain come pourin' down
I feel so good and I gotta get my feet on the ground on the ground.

Well. I'm walkin' real tall with my head held high in a cloud
I feel so good sometime I wanna holler out loud
Well I'm gonna take me a comin' down pill every time you come around
I feel so good and I gotta get my feet on the ground on the ground.

Well. I'm walkin' real tall with my head held high in a cloud
