My woman still loves me in spite of my way
For reason I don't understand
I guess some day she knows I'll come home to stay
That's why my woman keeps loving her man.

Someday she knows I'll be feeble and old
And unable to leave her again
She's happy just knowing that someday I'll change
That's why my woman keeps loving her man.

My woman is guilty of loving too much
A man who's only a man
And the mem'ry she clings to gives her something to touch
That's why my woman keeps loving her man.

Someday she knows I'll be feeble and old
And unable to leave her again
And someday she knows I'll come home to stay
That's why my woman keeps loving her man.

That's why my woman keeps loving her man...
