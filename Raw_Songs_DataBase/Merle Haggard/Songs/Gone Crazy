Well, you took my love for granted and I gave it all willingly
But seeing you with someone else was the breaking point for me
I know I'm goin' crazy I can feel it comin' on
The signs're all around me and I know I'll soon be gone
Gone crazy I may be hard to find gone crazy somewhere out of my mind.

But there'll be laughter all around me when they come and take me away
And in case you see me leavin' oh you can bet I've gone to stay
I know you're gonna miss me when you find I've gone insane
But I got the right to lose my mind if I can't stand the pain
Gone crazy I may be hard to find gone crazy somewhere out of my mind...
