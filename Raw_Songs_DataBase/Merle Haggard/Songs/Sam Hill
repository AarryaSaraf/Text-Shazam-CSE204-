There's a certain hill outside of town called Sam Hill   
And a certain guy used to go there every day     
They said a certain girl lived up in Sam Hill     
Aw, a pretty girl, not hep to city ways

This certain guy would come down the hill a smilin'
Headed back to town at the crack of dawn
And he had 'em all a wonderin' what he was doin'   
Yeah, wonderin' what in Sam Hill's goin' on

We knew this certain guy was not a goldminer       
Cause he never took a shovel or a pick  
He only took a little box of candy    
And disappeared in Sam Hill mighty quick

We tried to follow him to his destination    
But he had a secret path and soon he was gone      
And he had us all a wonderin' what he was doin'      
Yeah, wonderin' what in Sam Hill's goin' on

I know that you have wondered too about Sam Hill       
You've probably asked "What in Sam Hill's goin' on?"   
All I can say in answer to your question    
Is the goin's on are still goin' on

This certain guy's still takin' up his candy    
He's 99 and all his youth is gone     
But he climbs that hill and still comes down a smilin'         
And we're wonderin' what in Sam Hill's goin' on      
Wish I knew             
What in Sam Hill's goin' on        
He won't tell us'       
What in Sam Hill's goin' on      
He just snickers       
What in Sam Hill's goin' on
