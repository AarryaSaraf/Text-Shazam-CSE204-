Hey Roly Poly eatin' corn and taters
Hungry every minute of the day
Roly Poly knowin' all the biscuits
Long as he can chew it it's okay.

He can eat an apple pie and never even bat an eye
He likes everything from a soup to hay
Roly Poly daddy's little fatty
And he's gonna be a man someday.

Roly Poly scrambled eggs for breakfast bread
And jelly twenty times a day
Roly Poly eats a hard day dinner
It takes lots of strenght to run and play.

Bowls up weeds and does the chores
Run both ways to Holday's stores
He wears up that apetite that way
Roly Poly daddy's little fatty
But he's gonna be a man someday...
