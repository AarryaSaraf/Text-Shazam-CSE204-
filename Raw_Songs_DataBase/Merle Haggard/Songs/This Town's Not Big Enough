Today's the day I leave forever
This town where we once loved together
Now that love is gone I guess I'm free
I'll leave behind both you and sorrow

And take just what I'll have tomorrow
When there's miles and miles and miles
Between this town and me
This town's not big enough for both of us to be

I can't go anywhere without your memory
In every window pane your face is all I see
This town's not big enough to hold both you and me
I'll drop the dreams I've held so tightly
Shed my tears and travel lightly

Anything to ease my heavy load
I'll find a town in far-off places
Where the windows have no faces
Many miles from anywhere along this lonely road

This town's not big enough
