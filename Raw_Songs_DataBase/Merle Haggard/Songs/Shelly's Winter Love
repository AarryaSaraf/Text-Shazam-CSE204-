I know I'm only Shelly's winter love
She only seems to need me now and then
I know I'm only Shelly's winter love
But she's mine alone till springtime comes again

When springtime comes I know that she'll be leavin'
When those friends of her's start callin' her uptown
So I live and wait for Shelly's winter season
When her troubled moments bring her back around

I know I'm only Shelly's winter love
She only seems to need me now and then
I know I'm only Shelly's winter love
But she's mine alone till springtime comes again

When Shelly's painted world turns cold and stormy
It's then she finds the need to come around
To these arms of mine she knows are always waiting
But she'll leave when love has thawed the winter ground

I know I'm only Shelly's winter love
She only seems to need me now and then
I know I'm only Shelly's winter love
But she's mine alone till springtime comes again
