I came here because I knew I'd be welcome
And because somehow you always understand
You seem to have a way with lonely people
And you always were my greatest helping hand.

Now once again I'm here to take advantage
Though I don't deserve the arms I left alone
I need to know there's someone who still loves me
And I need a shoulder to cry on.

I overlooked the love you tried so hard to give
The love I never seemed to understand
I always stay just long enough to hurt you
And what little love I gave was second hand.

Now once again I'm here to take advantage
Cause once again the one I love is gone
I need to know there's someone who still loves me
And I need a shoulder to cry on.

I need to know there's someone who still loves me
And I need a shoulder to cry on...
