Yeah I'm a good loser born to be that way this dog he never had his day
Yeah I'm a good loser so don't worry bout my pride
Me don't look back you can't see my hurt inside

There must be a sin I'm payin' for cause I felt my share of heartaches long before
This same life runs in cicles I can't say they're wrong
My lucks been running bad too long
But I'm a good loser...

There's no sign of changes coming soon and I may never sing another tune
Cause losin' you would probly be my biggest hurt today
But don't you let my feelin's make your way
Cause I'm a good loser...
