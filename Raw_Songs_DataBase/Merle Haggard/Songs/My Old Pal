I'm thinking of you tonight old pal
And wishing that you were here
I'm dreaming of the time and the days gone by
When you filled my heart with cheer.

I remember the nights when all alone
We sang Sweet Adoline
No other face can take your place
In my heart old pal of mine.

Now the old pals are always the best you see
New friends you can find every day
But they can't fill their places or ever be
Like the old pals of yesterday.

I'm wondering just where you are tonight
And if you ever think of me
It would make my weary heart so light sweetheart
Your face again to see.

I remember the nights when all alone
We sang Sweet Adoline
No other face can take your place
In my heart old pal of mine.

Now the old pals are always the best you see
New friends you can find every day
But they can't fill their places or ever be
Like the old pals of yesterday...
