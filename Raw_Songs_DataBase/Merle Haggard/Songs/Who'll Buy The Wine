Not so long ago you held our baby's bottle
But the one you're holding now's a different kind
And you'd never know whose lips you'll soon be kissin'
'Cause it all depends on who will buy the wine.

Whoever sets 'em up and tips the waitress
Your kind of love just might as well be blind
And you'd never know whose lips you'll soon be kissin'
And it all depends on who will buy the wine.

The kind of life you're livin' since you left me
I'm sure is not the life you thought you choosed
Your honky tonkin' world is not so flashy
Bright lights and booze is all it really knows.

Whoever sets 'em up and tips the waitress
Your kind of love just might as well be blind
You just sit and wait to be somebody's baby
And it all depends on who will buy the wine...
