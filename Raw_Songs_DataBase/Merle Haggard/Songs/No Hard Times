I got a barrel of flour Lord I got a bucket of lard
I got a barrel of flour Lord I got a bucket of lard
I ain't got no blues got chickens in my backyard.

Got corn in my crib cotton growin' in my patch
I got corn in my crib cotton growin' in my patch
I got that old hen a sittin' waitin' for that old hen to hatch
Yodel lyee-oh hard time blues.

I'm gonna hitch up my mule and take a holt of my line
I'm gonna hitch up my mule and take a holt of my line
I can't be bothered with all those old hard times.

Oh, go ahead and pick one now.

I'm gonna build me a shanty Lord I'm gonna settle down
I'm gonna build me a shanty Lord I'm gonna settle down
Get me a corn fed mama and Lordy quit a runnin round.

Here he comes.

I can make more money with my pick and plow
I can make more money with my pick and plow
With my one-eyed mule and my good ole Jersey cow.

Yodel lyee-oh hard time blues...
