We stopped living when our love died and I wanta live again

Our love grew cold a long time ago we both know love is gone
Yet we stay together, we just keep hanging on
But it's wrong to live together when our love has reached an end
We stopped living when our love died and I wanta live again

I wanna be kissed like I used to be
Thrilled like I used to be
Loved like I used to be
I wanta live again

Each time we kiss we search for love that used to fill our hearts
But it's all wrong the thrill is gone, we're just too far apart
We live a life of loneliness each day that we pretend
We stopped living when our love died and I wanta live again

I wanna be kissed like I used to be
Thrilled like I used to be
Loved like I used to be
I wanta live again
