One of these mornings I'm sure gonna leave this town
One of these mornings I'm sure gonna leave this town
'Cause a triflin' woman sure keeps a good man down.

Yes, she left me this morning midnight was turning day
She left me this morning midnight was turning day
I didn't have no blues till my good gal went away.

I got the blues like midnight moon shining bright as day
I got the blues like midnight moon shining bright as day
I wish a tornado would blow my blues away.

Here come them dobro.

It's like in 1930.

When a man is down and out a woman don't want him round
Hey, when a man is down and out a woman don't want him round
But when a man's got money he's the sweetest guy in town.

A woman will follow you right to the jailhouse door
Hey, a woman will follow you right to the jailhouse door
Then she'll laugh and tell you that you can't fuss and fight no more.

I got the blues like midnight moon shining bright as day Lord Lord
I got the blues like midnight moon shining bright as day
I wish a tornado would blow my blues away.

Yodel le-ee yodel le-ee e-ee e-ee...
