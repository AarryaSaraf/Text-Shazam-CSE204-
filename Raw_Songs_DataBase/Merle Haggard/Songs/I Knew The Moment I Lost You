A man may have his trials and tribulations
And at times he feels so low and so blue
But from now on I will be entirely different
And I knew the moment I lost you.

Well to all my worries and my disappointments
There is still a little light shining through
Still within my heart I know there is another
And I knew the moment I lost you.

There is nothing we can do to get along
Now that's been proved unto me and to you
So why not let's be fair to each other
For I knew the moment I lost you.

If there's something I have done you've not forgiven
Just remember that I'm human same as you
Why not let's consider our mistakes dear
For I knew the moment I lost you...
