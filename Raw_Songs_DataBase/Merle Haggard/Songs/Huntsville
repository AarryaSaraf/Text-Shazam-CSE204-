That old white haired judge in Dallas
Didn't pay my story no mind
They're takin' me down to Huntsville
I'm bringin' in a load of time

They caught me on a caper that I planned for days
And proved everything I done
I'm on my way to Huntsville 
Bt I'm looking for a chance to run

My hands don't fit no choppin' pole
And cotton never was my beg
The men better keep both eyes on me
Or they're gonna lose old Hag

Hey there ain't so far to Mexico 
There I can find my way
They're takin' me down to Huntsville
But I'm not gonna stay

They got me chain and leg irons 
I guess they got a good excuse
They know I'm gonna run the first chance
I get cause they never gonna cut me loose

And I really don't care if they shoot me down
I'll never be free again
I've got two long life turns to do 
Both runnin' in the end

Hey there ain't so far to Mexico 
There I can find my way
They're takin' me down to Huntsville
But I'm not gonna stay
