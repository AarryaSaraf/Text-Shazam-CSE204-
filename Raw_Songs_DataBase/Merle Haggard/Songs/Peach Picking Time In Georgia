When it's peach picking time in Georgia apple picking time in Tennessee
Cotton picking time in Mississippi everybody picks on me
And when it's roundup time in Texas the cowboys make whoopee
And way on down in Alabama it's gal picking time to me
Yodel le-ee oh le-ee oh de oh le-ee.

There's a bluegrass down in Kentucky Virginia's where they do the swing
And Carolina now I'm coming to you to spend the spring
Arkansas I hear you calling I know I'll see you soon
And there's where we'll do a little picking underneath the Ozark moon
Yodel le-ee oh le-ee oh de oh le-ee.

When all the pickers picking cotton that's when I pick a wedding ring
We'll go downtown and buy wedding gown for the wedding in the spring
I hope the preacher knows his business I know he can't fool me
When it's peach picking time in Georgia it's gal picking time to me
Yodel le-ee oh le-ee oh de oh le-ee...
