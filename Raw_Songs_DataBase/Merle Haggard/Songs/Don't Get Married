Julie they've taken me to prison
I pulled the gun and robbed the jewelry store
The only thing I took was that big diamond
You know the one you said you wish was yours.

The diamond in the window called for money
The price was just too much for me to pay
But the price I'm paying now is so much bigger
Oh Julie, don't I have the right to say.

Don't get married, Julie wait for me
Don't get married 'cause someday I'll be free.

[Instrumental]

Julie, when I serve the time they gave me
I'll walk out through the gates and I'll be free
I hope you didn't only want the diamond
'Cause I pray that you also wanted me.

Don't get married, Julie wait for me
Don't get married 'cause someday I'll be free...
