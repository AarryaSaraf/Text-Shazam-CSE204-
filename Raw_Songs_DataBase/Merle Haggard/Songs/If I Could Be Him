We're all friends you and I me and him
And it's wrong to want you like I do
And no way can wrong be right but I'd give the world tonight
If I could just be him holding you
I know that you could never trade his love for mine
And I know my dreams can never be
Cause no way can wrong be right but I'd give the world tonight
If I could just be him instead of me
I can see everything in you I ever dreamed of
But someone I call my friend stands in the way
I'd give everything I own for one hour with you alone
Or if I could just be him for just one day
I can see everything in you...
