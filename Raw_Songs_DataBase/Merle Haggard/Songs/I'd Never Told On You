Nobody knew you were hurting me
As long as you were mine no one else could see
But you left me then you left him and he told the things you do
But if you'd love me I'd never told on you.

I was loyal to the pain that you put me through
Even the one who took you never knew
But you left me then you left him and he told the things you do
But if you'd love me I'd never told on you.

But you left me then you left him and he told the things you do
But if you'd love me I'd never told on you...
