Deep within my heart lies
A melody, a song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I lived with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone

It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love

Moon and all your splendor know
Only my heart call back my Rose, Rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals
Falling apart speak once again of my love my own

Oh, broken song empty words
I know still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose my Rose of San Antone
