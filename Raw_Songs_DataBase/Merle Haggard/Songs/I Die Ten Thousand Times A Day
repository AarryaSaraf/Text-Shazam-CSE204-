I come home and I sat down by the door
I just sat and dream my lonely life away
I just can't stand a thought that I won't see you anymore
I guess I die ten thousand times a day.

If that soulful life comes to its end
I ceased to live the night you went away
If you walk through that door then I'll start to live again
I guess I die ten thousand times a day.

I pick up each thing you used to touch
I call to mine each tender word you say
If I've hurt you it's just because I love you much too much
I guess I die ten thousand times a day...
