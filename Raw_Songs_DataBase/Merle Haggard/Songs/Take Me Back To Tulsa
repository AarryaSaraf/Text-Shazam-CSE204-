Where's that gal with red dress on
Some folks called her Dinah
Stole my heart away from me
Way down in Louisiana.

Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry.

Little bee sucks the blossom
Big bee makes the honey
Poor man raise the cotton
Rich man makes the money.

Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry.

Walk and talk to Suzy
Walk and talk to Suzy
Walk and talk to Suzy
Walk and talk to Suzy

Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry.

We always wear a great big smile
We never do look sour
Travel all over the country
Playing by the hour.

Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry.

Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry
Take me back to Tulsa
I'm too young to marry...
