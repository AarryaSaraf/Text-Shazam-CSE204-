Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm.

Too many arms have held you too close
And too many eyes have cried
Too many heartaches are clingin' to you
And most of those heartaches are mine.

When your fair weather love lets you down
And you feel you can't live with the pain
When the sunshine and flowers are gone
I'm somewhere to come when it rains.

Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm.

You had all the lust and the lure of a diamond
But I've learned that a stone is a stone
As long as it's held in the hand it's warm
But it grows cold when you leave it alone.

When your fair weather love lets you down
And you feel you can't live with the pain
When the sunshine and flowers are gone
I'm somewhere to come when it rains.

I'll be waiting for you in the rain...
