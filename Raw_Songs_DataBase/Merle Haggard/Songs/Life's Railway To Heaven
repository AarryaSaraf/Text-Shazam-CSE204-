Life is like a mountain railroad
With an engineer that's brave
We must make the run successful
From the cradle to the grave

Watch the curves, the fills, the tunnels
Never falter, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eyes upon the rail

Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us
Till we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels want to join us
In that grace forevermore

As you roll across the trestle
Spanning Jordon's swelling tide
You'll behold the Union Depot
Into which your train will glide

There you'll meet the superintendent
God the Father, God the Son
With a hearty joyous greetings
"Weary Pilgrims, Welcome Home"

Blessed Savior, Thou will guide us
Till we reach that blessed shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In that grace forevermore
In that grace forevermore
