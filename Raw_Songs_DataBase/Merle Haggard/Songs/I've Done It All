Did you ever steal a quarter when you was 10 years old?
Ever wear a brogan with a hole in the sole?
Did you ever ride a freight train while runnin' from the law?
I've done it all, lawd lawd, I've done it all.

Did you ever spend a winter in a dirty jail?
Did you ever buy a topcoat at a rummage sale?
Did you ever spend a Christmas inside detention hall?
I've done it all, lawd lawd, I've done it all.

Well, I've picked my share of cotton, boys
and I've drove one railroad spike.
And I've been everywhere I talk about
and I can tell you what its like.

I've even been to 'Frisco wearin' reg'lar clothes
With  them modern hippie folks starin' down their nose.
I can proudly say I've answered my patriotic call
I've done it all, lawd lawd, I've done it all.
