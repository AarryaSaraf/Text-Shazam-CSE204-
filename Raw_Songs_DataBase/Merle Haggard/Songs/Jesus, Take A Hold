Like the ancient Roman Empire this world is doomed to fall 
And it's much too big a thing for mortal man 
Just take a look around and see the writing on the wall 
Somehow we've got to find a helping hand 

This world has never been in the awful shape it's in 
And people scorn the things our leaders do 
It's time a prayer was spoken from the hearts of every man 

Jesus take a hold and lead us through 

The mighty roar of gunfire is now a local sound 
And our city streets are filled with angry men 
Law's now a mockery throughout our troubled land 
And destruction seems to be the current trend 

This world has never been in the awful shape it's in 
And our leaders seem in doubt what to do 
It's time a prayer was spoken from the hearts of every man 
Jesus take a hold and lead us through 
Jesus take a hold and lead us through
