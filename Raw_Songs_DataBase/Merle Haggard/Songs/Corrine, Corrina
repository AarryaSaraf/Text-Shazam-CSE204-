I love Corrina tell the world I do
I love Corrina tell the world I do
Just a little more lovin' makes your heart beat true.

Corrine Corrina where you've been so long
Corrine Corrina where you've been so long
Ain't had no lovin' since you been gone.

Corrine Corrina where you stayed last night
Corrine Corrina where you stayed last night
Came home this morning sun was shinin' bright.

Goodbye Corrina this is fare thee well
Goodbye Corrina this is fare thee well
When I get back babe Lord you never can tell...
