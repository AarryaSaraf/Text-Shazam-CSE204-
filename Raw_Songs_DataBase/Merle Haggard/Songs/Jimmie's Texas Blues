The way I been treated sometime I wish I were dead
The way I been treated sometime I wish I were dead
Cause I ain't got no place to lay my weary head.

When I want you woman I always find you gone
Everytime I want you I always find you gone Lord you've gone all time honey
Listen here good mama I'm gonna put your headbreaks on.

Yeah, some like Chicago some love old Memphis Tennessee
Yeah, some like Chicago some love old Memphis Tennessee
And give me sweet Dallas Texas where the women think a world of me
Now here's the dobro.

You may have your troubles I'm having my troubles too
You may have your troubles I'm having my troubles too
Yes I know how it feels when you're feeling so doggone blue.

I'm not singing the blues I'm telling you the hard luck I've had Lord I've had it
I'm not singing the blues I'm telling you the hard luck I've had
Cause the blues ain't nothing but a good man feeling bad.

De yodel le-ee ai-ee yodel e-ee...
