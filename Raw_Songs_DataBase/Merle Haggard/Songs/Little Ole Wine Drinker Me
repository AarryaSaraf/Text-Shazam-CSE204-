I'm praying for rain in California
So the grapes can grow and they can make more wine
And I'm a sittin' at a honky'n in Chicago
With a broken heart and a woman on my mind.

I match the man behind a bar for the jukebox
And the music takes me back to Tennessee
When they ask who's the fool in the corner cryin'
I say a little ole wine drinker me.

I came here last week from down in Nashville
Cause my baby left for Florida on a train
And I thought I'd get a job and just forget her
But in Chicago a broken heart is still the same.

I match the man behind a bar for the jukebox
And the music takes me back to Tennessee
When they ask who's the fool in the corner cryin'
I say a little ole wine drinker me.

Yeah, I say a little ole wine drinker me...
