I just remember something that I forgot to do
The bedroom door needs paintin' and the walls are fadin' too
Angie's bike needs fixin' that all takes time you see
And I know I'm not fooling you goodbye comes hard for me.

So I'll just check for things once more and look in every room
I must have dropped my comb somewhere and a man must stay well groomed
It seems I have the right to stay but I know you don't agree
When it's goodbye to all our love goodbye comes hard for me.

Goodbye comes hard for me and I hoped you'd grab my sleeve
I thought that you might change your mind and ask me not to leave
My face is wet I've dried I guess I loved you now you're free
When it's goodbye to all our love goodbye comes hard for me.

My face is wet I've dried I guess I loved you now you're free
When it's goodbye to all our love goodbye comes hard for me...
