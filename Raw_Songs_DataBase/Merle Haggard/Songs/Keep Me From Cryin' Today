Hold me and love me
And tell me that you decided to stay
At least put it off till tomorrow
And keep me from cryin' today.

Help me make ready with the heartache
Rhat's soon will be coming my way
Consider how little I'm asking of you
And keep me from cryin' today.

Keep me from cryin' today
Help me forget in your own special way
Let's save our goodbyes for tomorrow
And keep me from cryin' today.

Let's save our goodbyes for tomorrow
And keep me from cryin' today...
