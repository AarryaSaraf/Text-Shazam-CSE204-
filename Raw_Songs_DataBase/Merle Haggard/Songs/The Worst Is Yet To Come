Such a little time has passed since you went away
Where are all these heartaches coming from
I can hardly stand the pain of missing you today
And I know the worst is yet to come

If there was something I could find to drive these tears from me
Then I'd go right out and get me one
I've already cried enough to fill the deep blue sea
And I know the worst is yet to come

There'll be all those sleepless nights when I'll just lay and cry
And the hours seem to have no end
There'll be days when it won't matter if I live or die
Wishing I could have you back again

If there was something I could find to drive these tears from me
Then I'd go right out and get me one
I've already cried enough to fill the deep blue sea
And I know the worst is yet to come
