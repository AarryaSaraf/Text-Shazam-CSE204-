I'm gonna break every heart I can 
I'd be a find-'em-and-fool-'em man
I'm gonna dedicate my whole life to this one plan
Well if I live and have enough time 
I'll get evil with the woman kind
I'm gonna break every heart I can in everyone I find
I'm gonna think of lotta good lies
I'm gonna laugh when a woman cries
I'm gonna have myself a style to recognize
I'm gonna travel all around the world 
I'd be a friend to the sweetest girl
I'm gonna break every heart I can 
And all my name ain't Merle

Well if I ever get around to you 
You gonna know about the things I do
They gonna tell about the harm 
I've done in the latest News
Cause if I live and have enough time 
I'll get evil with the woman kind
I'm gonna break every heart 
I can in everyone I find
I'm gonna break every heart I can 
I'd be a love-'em-and-leave-'em man
I'm gonna dedicate my whole life to this one plan

Well if I live and have enough time 
I'll get evil with the woman kind
I'm gonna break every heart I can in everyone I find
I'm gonna break every heart I can in everyone I find
