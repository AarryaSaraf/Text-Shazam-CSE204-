Precious memories, unseen angels
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger ever near me
And the sacred past unfold

Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold

Precious father, loving mother
Fly accross the lonely years
And the home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appears

Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious sacred scenes unfold
