Oh, the sunny side of my life is the side you're living on
Grey skies never come when I'm with you
Good times hang around only when you're here at home
The sunny side of my life is here with you.

Standing at my window watching raindrops hit the ground
Countin' up the days you've been away
It's lonely here without you and the blues had got me down
Come on home and brighten up my days.

Oh, the sunny side of my life is the side you're living on
Grey skies never come when I'm with you
Good times hang around only when you're here at home
The sunny side of my life is here with you.

Sittin' on a park bench with the funnies in my hand
Trying hard to laugh at what I see
The sunny side of my life is shining somewhere else
Nothing's quite the way it ought to be.

Oh, the sunny side of my life is the side you're living on
Grey skies never come when I'm with you
Good times hang around only when you're here at home
The sunny side of my life is here with you...
