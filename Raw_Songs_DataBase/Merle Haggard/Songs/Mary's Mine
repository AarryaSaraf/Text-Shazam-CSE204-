Mary's mine and she'll always be till the end of time
She gave her heart to me
No truer love could I ever find than Mary's love
And Mary's mine

I once lived the life without meaning 
Just the face with no place in this world
At last I found reason for living 
And I owe it all to the love of a girl

Her love gave me reason for living 
To make her happy is first on my mind
Because of her my life has real meaning
I love her so and I know Mary's mine

Mary's mine and she'll always be till the end of time
She gave her heart to me
No truer love could I ever find than Mary's love
And Mary's mine

No truer love could I ever find than Mary's love 
Cause Mary's mine
