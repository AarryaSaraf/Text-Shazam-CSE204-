I can't stand me since I lost you and I can't stand nobody else
I can't stand me since you went away and I gotta get away from myself

I used to be a high-stepper with a lot on the ball my friends all called me Ace 
It took a woman like you to bring a good man down
And make me ashamed to even show my face
I can't stand me since I lost you...

Oh when I look in the glass and see a grown man cry it makes me wanna hang my head
I used to feel real proud just to be alive but now I think I'd rather be dead
I can't stand me since I lost you...

I'm gonna find me a river about ten miles wide with a bridge right all way cross
I'm gonna drag myself about half way over and then I'm gonna throw me off
I can't stand me since I lost you...
Yeah I gotta get away from myself
