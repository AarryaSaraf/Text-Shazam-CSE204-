Warm red wine you know that place where you take me some times
Where my caress have wings and fly right off my shoulder
Where I leave my cares behind and for a while find peace of mind
Help me friend of mine wine take me away.

Wine take me away where I can lose myself
Take me where I won't even see the light of day
It's my life and I wanna live it it's my will and I wanna give it
Help me friend of mine wine take me away.

When my life becomes a grime and when I'm weary and tired
Then I'll tell myself I need a short vacation
I gotta leave this lonely town and you're the quickest way I found
Help me friend of mine wine take me away.

Wine take me away where I can lose myself
Take me where I won't even see the light of day
It's my life and I wanna live it it's my will and I wanna give it
Help me friend of mine wine take me away.

Help me friend of mine wine take me away...
