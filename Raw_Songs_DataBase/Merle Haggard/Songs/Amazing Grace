Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas grace that taught me how to live
And grace my fears relieved
How blessed, how blessed, the son of God
The hour I first believe

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Then when we first begun

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
I was blind, but now I see
