About the time the late and great Jimmie Rodgers career came to an end
Another young fella by the name of Bob Wills
Was makin' preparations to become a legend in his own time
Somewhere round about 1934
He formed the group called the Texas Playboys
With the help of these original musicians
On this album we're gonna turn back the pages of time
And recapture some of the great sounds of legendary Bob Wills and his
Texas Playboys
