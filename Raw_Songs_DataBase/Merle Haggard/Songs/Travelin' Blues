I had a dream last night I thought my good gal had gone
Well, I woke up this morning she really had done me wrong
Well, I know it's not fair but my good gal has done caught air.

Well, I'm goin' away leavin' today, I'm gonna bring my baby back
If that eight wheel driver don't jump the railroad track
I'll take her from that man I'm gonna bring her home if I can.

My gal's been triflin' round about a week I know
Well, several of my friends done told me so and so
She's been triflin' round but now she has turned him down.

I'm goin' away leavin' today, I'm gonna bring my baby back
If that eight wheel driver don't jump the railroad track
I'll take her from that man I'm gonna bring her home if I can.

Now pickin' blues one time.

It's true my baby's gone I know it won't be long
We'll both be on that train my baby's coming home again
She's found a new man but now she can't understand.

That I'm goin' away leavin' today, I'm gonna bring my baby back
If that eight wheel driver don't jump the railroad track
I'll take her from that man I'm gonna bring her home if I can.

Here we go yodel one time...
