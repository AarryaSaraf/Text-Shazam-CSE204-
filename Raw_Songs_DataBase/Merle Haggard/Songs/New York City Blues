Everyone in New York City's got a frowning face
And I'm sure glad that I'm just passing through
This old country boy from Okie sure feels out of place
That's why I'm singing these New York City blues,

Now southern hospitality is far behind
A thing these yankee folks don't ever use
You'll find it somewhere down below that Dixon Line
Oh Lordm I got these New York City blues
Here comes now,

This old town sure gets lonely late at night
When your only friend's a rotgut jug of booze
But come daylight in the morning I'll be out of sight
Lord I got these New York City blues.

Yeah, southern hospitality will soon be mine
'Cause I'm going back where the sidewalks fit my shoes
Mmm, mhm ,mhm, mhm, mhm
I got these New York City blues...
