Tulare dust in a farm boy's nose
Wondering where the freight train goes
Standin' in the field by the railroad track 
Cursin' this strap on my cotton sack

I can see mom and dad with shoulders low 
Both of 'em pickin' on a double row
They do it for a livin' because they must 
That's life like it is in the Tulare dust

The California sun was something new 
That when we arrived in '42
And I can still remember how my daddy cussed
The tumbleweeds here in the Tulare dust

The wally fever was a comin' fate 
To the farmworkers here in the Golden State
And I miss Oklahoma but I'll stay 
If I must and help make a livin' in the Tulare dust

The Tulare dust in a farm boy's nose
Wondering where the freight train goes
Standin' in the field by the railroad track 
Cursin' this strap on my cotton sack
