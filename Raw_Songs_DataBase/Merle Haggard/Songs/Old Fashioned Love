Got that old fashioned love in my heart
And there it will always remain
Like an ivy clinging vine clinging closer all the time
Through these years and these tears just the same.

Got that old fashioned fate in my heart
And nothing can tear us apart
Dry land may turn to sea but there'll be no change in me
Got that old fashioned love in my heart.

Got that old fashioned love in my heart
And there it will always remain
Like an ivy clinging vine clinging closer all the time
Through these years and these tears just the same...
