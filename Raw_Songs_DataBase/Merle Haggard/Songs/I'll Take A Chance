If you don't want to run around
If you wanna settle down
I'll take a chance on loving you
If you will be my very own
If you'll be mine and mine alone
I'll take a chance on loving you

There's a lotta pretty girls in this wide wide world
But none of them should hold a life to you
You're the nicest, the neatest, the cutest and the sweetest
And I'll tell you what I'm gonna do

If you don't want to run around
If you wanna settle down
I'll take a chance on loving you
If you will be my very own
If you'll be mine and mine alone
I'll take a chance on loving you

Did you really mean it or did I just dream it
When you said I was the one for you
Too late to forget it, too late to regret it
That day that I fell in love with you

If you don't want to run around
If you wanna settle down
I'll take a chance on loving you
If you will be my very own
If you'll be mine and mine alone
I'll take the chance on loving you
