Oh, you poor, broke, mixed up, mess of a heart
Yeah, a little, bitty woman gonna tear you all apart
I warned you a thousand times
But you wouldn't listen nor pay me no mind
You poor, broke, mixed up, mess of a heart

Yeah, I watched her buy her tickets in Charlotte, North Carolina
And I heard her say, "One-way, please, to Denver"
She's goin' to meet that other guy and it won't do us no good to cry
'Cause she's wearin' his ring on her finger

Oh, you poor, broke, mixed up, mess of a heart
Yeah, a little, bitty woman gonna tear you all apart
Yeah, I warned you a thousand times
But you wouldn't listen nor pay me no mind
You poor, broke, mixed up, mess of a heart

Well, I watched her tip the porter
As she stepped aboard that midnight train bound to take her faraway forever
I watched the tail light fade away knowing she was goin' to stray
And I wish this broken heart was leavin' with her

Oh, you poor, broke, mixed up, mess of a heart
Yeah, a little, bitty woman gonna tear you all apart
I warned you a thousand times
But you wouldn't listen nor pay me no mind
You poor, broke, mixed up, mess of a heart
You poor, broke, mixed up, mess of a heart
