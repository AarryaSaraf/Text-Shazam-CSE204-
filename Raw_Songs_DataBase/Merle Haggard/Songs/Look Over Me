If some time we're thrown together by our friends
And we're forced to see each other once again
I may lose control inspite of how I try
Please look over me while I cry.

If I'm fool enough to keep on loving you
After all the grief and heartache I've been through
Be kind enough to help me save my pride
Please look over me while I cry.

Pretend you're not aware of how you torture me
And with your help maybe no one else will notice me
Be kind enough to help me save my pride
Please look over me while I cry.

Pretend you're not aware of how you torture me
And with your help maybe no one else will notice me
Be kind enough to help me save my pride
Please look over me while I cry...
