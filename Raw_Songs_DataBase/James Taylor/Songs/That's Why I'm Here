Person to person and man to man, I'm back in touch with my long lost friend.
Listen to reason and understand and think of me from way back when.
He said, me and Melissa, well we fell out of love. We ran out of luck seems like lightning struck.
I've been thinking of leaving but I can't raise a buck,
James, I'm wondering could I borrow your truck?

I said that's why I'm here. Got no other reason,
that's why I'm standing before you, that's why I'm here.

John's gone, found dead, he dies high, he's brown bread. Later said to have drowned in his bed.
After the laughter, the wave of the dread, it hits us like a ton of lead.
It seems "learn not to burn" means to turn on a dime
and walk on if you're walking even if it's an uphill climb.
And try to remember that working's no crime, just don't let 'em take and waste your time.
That's why I'm here.

This is an IOU, I reckon I owe you one now.
Listen Wendy and listen Gloria, this'll be better tomorrow.

Fortune and fame's such a curious game. Perfect strangers can call you by name.
Pay good money to hear fire and rain again and again and again.
Some are like summer coming back every year,
got your baby got your blanket got your bucket of beer.
I break into a grin from ear to ear and suddenly it's perfectly clear.
That's why I'm here.

This is the part about Kitty and Jim, he loved her and she loved him.
Wake 'em up shake 'em up the middle of the night, got to tell me everything's alright.
He said that's why I'm here. That's right.
