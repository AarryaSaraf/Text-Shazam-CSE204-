She's been holding on too long hoping I'm gonna change.
Giving it up just a little bit more each time I come home, looking and acting strange.
Putting her down for putting up with me.

Be as you are, as you see, as I am, I am. Be as you are, as you see, as I am, I am.

Do you think you might improve me, trying to take control?
Watching every little thing I do just like a bleeding movie, just like a leading role?
Mama, this ain't me and I don't believe that's you.

Be as you are, as you see, as I am, I am. Be as you are, as you see, as I am, I am.

First you make believe, I believe the things that you make believe
and I'm bound to let you down.
Then it's I who have been deceiving, purposely misleading,
and all along you believed in me.

So we circle around one another playing I guessing game, strangers at this masquerade.
Pretending to know each other, we strain to catch a name
and never see the mistakes we must have made.

Be as you are, as you see, as I am, I am. Be as you are, as you see, as I am, I am.
