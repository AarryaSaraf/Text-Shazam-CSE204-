Just knocking around the zoo on a Thursday afternoon,
there's bars on all the windows and they're counting up the spoons, yeah.
And if I'm feeling edgy, there's a chick who's paid to be my slave, yeah, watch out James.
But she'll hit me with a needle if she thinks I'm trying to misbehave.

Now the keeper's trying to cool me/ says I'm bound to be all right,
but I know that he can't fool me cause I'm putting him uptight, yeah.
And I can feel him getting edgy every time I make a sudden move, whoa, yes it's true.
And I can hear them celebrating every time I up and leave the room.

Now my friends all come to see me, they just point at me and stare.
Said, he's just like the rest of us so what's he doing there?
They hide in their movie theaters drinking juice, keeping tight, watch that bright light.
Cause they're certain about one thing, babe, that zoo's no place to spend the night, no.

Just knocking around the zoo on a Thursday afternoon,
there's bars on all the windows and they're counting up the spoons, yeah.
And if I'm feeling edgy, there's a chick who's paid to be my slave, watch out Kootch.
But she'll hit me with a needle if she thinks I'm trying to misbehave.
