Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon. Oh, Mud Slide, I'm dependent on you.
I don't know but I've been told, there's a time from time to time.
I can't eat, I can't sleep but I just might move my feet.
Cause there's nothing like the sound of sweet soul music to change a young lady's mind.
And there's nothing like a walk on down by the bayou to leave the world behind, whoa,
Mud Slide I'm depending upon you. Mister Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon.

I've been letting the time go by, letting the time go by,
yes, I'm letting the time go by, letting the time go by.

I'm gonna cash in my hand and pick up on a piece of land
and build myself a cabin back in the woods.
Lord, it's there I'm gonna stay until there comes a day
when this old world starts to changing for the good.
Now the reason I'm smiling is over on a island on a hillside in the woods where I belong.
I wanna thank Jimmy, Jimmy, John, Nick and Laurie, the No Jets Construction
for setting me down a homestead on the farm, whoa, ooooo.

Mud Slide, I'm depending upon you. Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon.
Night goes on and on, don't want to come at all.  Baby, baby, baby, I know.
Stoney Lee Blue Borne, picking on a fretless bass, yeah, yeah.
Oil slick, slipping and a sliding and a slapping on.  Kootcheroo.
