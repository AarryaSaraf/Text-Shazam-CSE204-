It's written in the surface of her skin, there's been a baby there, given away in love.
I see it in the little lines around her eyes, across her brow.
She'll be drifting away from me now.
She'll shape all the feeling that's not quite there inside my soul.
Love has gone away now, leaving behind an empty hole.
And who am I to try to compete with the din, as the silence so easily rushes in?
I will fly away.

It was something I only dreamed of, something that I'm not quite sure of,
something that I'll never tell you about.
