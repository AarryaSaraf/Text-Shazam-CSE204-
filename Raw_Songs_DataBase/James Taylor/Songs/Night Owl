A catfish, he tends to groove on the water, it's just where he's bound to be.
And a monkey kinds of flashes on fruits and bananas, so he lives in the top of a tree.
But my eyes are made for darkness and so the nighttime is right for me,
Said I'm a night owl, honey, sleep all day long.

Now most folks they like the good day time, they like to see the shining sun.
They're up in the morning off and running till they're too tired for having fun.
But when the sun goes down and them bright lights shine, my daytime has just begun.
I'm a night owl, honey, sleep all day long.

Said turn off that bright light, baby, you're just about to drive me blind.
Draw them curtains for me, mama, you watch and you'll see how my love light shines.

Now, there's two sides to this great big world, and one of them is always night.
Hey, if you can take care of business in the sunshine, baby, I guess you're gonna be all right.
But don't come looking for string bean to lend you a hand,
because my eyes they can't stand the light,
No, I'm a night owl, honey, sleep all day long. I said sleep all day long, I'm a night owl, honey.
