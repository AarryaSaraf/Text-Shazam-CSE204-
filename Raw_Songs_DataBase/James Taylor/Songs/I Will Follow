Yonder mountain so high, I can't make it all on my own, no.
Rolling river, why so wide? To sweep me up and to bear me on,
up against the sky so bright that I can't even close my eyes.

I know I will follow, follow love, yes, yes, I will follow, follow love.
I know I will follow, follow love.

Growing slowly like a tree, someday soon, darling I love you, I love you.
Soft and gentle, full Summer moon, set my soul free, thank you, baby.
Drifting like a cloud in the sky, I can see myself from high above.

I know I must follow, follow love, yes, yes, I will follow, follow love.
I know I will follow, follow love.

Oh, half the future and half the past, they're waiting inside your eyes.
Yes, and after all of this, to last and last till at last it's your time to rise, rise.

True believer that I am, I am blind, lead me on, lead me on.
Blessed receiver of your love, I own my own time and I've been holding on, holding on.
Leave the word unspoken and the spell will not be broken.

And I'm bound to follow, now, follow love. I know I must go, follow love.
I must follow, follow love. Yes, I must follow, follow love.
Someone to hold my hand, follow love. Somebody to lead me on, follow love.
Somebody to walk beside me, follow love. Someone to follow me now, follow love.
I must follow love, follow love. I will fall in love.
I will follow love, follow love, anywhere it leads me.
I will follow love, follow love, follow love.
