Gotta watchdog watching me, doggy, watching me packing my bags.
He knows I'm leaving town, I can see that it's a drag.
Why leave the life I love here in the great state of Maine
just to ride that shining rail, just to size that ball and chain?

Oh, I gotta spend just a little more time with you, that's why.
Gotta spend just a little more time with you, oh oh oh.

I passed on the cocaine, said bye-bye to my methadone.
Put down the bottle for one more day, backing off of my tobacco jones.
Still feel like a hopeless junkie, like a man who can't say no.
I look back and there's that monkey, rascal won't let go, let me go.

Gotta spend just a little more time with you, that's right.
Gotta spend just a little more time with you, oh oh.
Gotta spend just a little more time with you, yes I do, yes I do, now.
Gotta spend just a little more time with you, oh oh oh.

I get high and I can't come down, I get high just hanging around.
I get high, I go lost and found, I get high oh I oh I,
gotta spend just a little more time with you, I'll be walking in the light.
Gotta spend just a little bit more time with you, oh oh.
Gotta spend just a little more time with you, just a little more time, just a little more time.
Gotta spend just a little bit more time with you, oh oh....
