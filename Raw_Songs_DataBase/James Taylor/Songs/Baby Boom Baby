Somehow the season always brings a picture of you, baby boom baby
Holding on for everything you figured you're due, little turtleneck girl
The moon on your shoulder, the wind in your lovely hair, oh what a night
We sat on the beach and watched as the sun rose into the Summer air

You said we couldn't miss what we never knew
something about something that you had to do
sitting on the sand with a hole in my shoe

I had no way of knowing where you might have been, time goes by
All on my own I imagine you a life in between, all own my own
Wrote a long letter but it never made it out of my head, oh, oh
somehow reading your name it wasn't the same as leaving the thing unsaid

How come I miss what I never knew
drag out the past just to paint it blue
and spend my days with a dream of you?

Oh, after the fall, here I'm trying to find our name on the wall
It was neither yours nor mine, it was something of the two combined
from a time spent out of time

I work hard to see that you remember my name, nod your head yes
Do all I can to make you want to see me again, oh what a night
Got a letter from the mail, got a message from the telephone
Seems you're working in town, moving around and living alone

Now I'm caught in the spotlight, walking the wire
my feet are frozen and my heart's on fire
what do I do if my dream comes true?
La la la, la la la la la...
