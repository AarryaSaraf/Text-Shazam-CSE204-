I'll tell you about Machine Gun Kelly he rode along the outlaw trail.
Machine Gun Kelly was a simple man but the woman was as hard as hell.
Watch out Machine Gun, don't let her run you round.
Don't let the woman put you six feet in the ground, Machine Gun.

I'll tell you about Katherine Kelly, tired of being such small time, now.
Figured they'd kidnap a rich man's son, make it in the world of crime.
Watch out Machine Gun, don't let her run you round.
Don't let the woman put you six feet in the ground, Machine Gun.

You'd better watch out Machine Gun Kelly, careful of what you do, now.
If you keep listening to your old lady, ain't no telling what'll happen to you, now,
Machine Gun.

The government boys they came for Machine Gun, took the poor boy away.
Stuck him in a hole in Leavenworth prison where he lived until his dying day.

Watch out Machine Gun, don't let her put you down.
Don't let a woman make you out to be a clown, Machine Gun.
Watch out Machine Gun.
