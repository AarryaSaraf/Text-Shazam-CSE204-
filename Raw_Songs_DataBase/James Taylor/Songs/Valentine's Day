Beneath the tide the fishes glide, fin to fin and side to side.
For fishy love has now begun, fishy love, finny fun.

Paper moon, paper heart, pink balloon, work of art. Al Capone, Bugs Moran, Valentine's Day.
Bootleg gin, porkpie hat, dew Drop Inn, dirty rat, through the heart Cupid's dart, Valentine's Day.

Oh, day to repay the one that you love, Gentlemen, take off your hats as I speak thereof.
Just a brief break from the push and the shove, we may go a few rounds without boxing gloves.

Land your punch, I stand my ground, we break for lunch and a second round.
We set them up, we knock them down, Valentine's Day.

Me and you, you and him, him and her, us and them, we keep score love as war, Valentine's Day.

I lost my teeth, I lost my hair, I lost my mind, you don't care.
Love is war, all is fair on Valentine's Day.
