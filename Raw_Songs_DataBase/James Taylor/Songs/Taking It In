Morning, sing me a song, afternoon, bring it along, nighttime, show me a friend,
say it again, send a good dream my way.

Wednesday, feeling just fine, I got to say time on my hands. Friday, look at them run,
show me some fun, taking the sunshine in.

God knows you've got to give yourself time to think these days,
Lord knows you've got to take enough, time to look both ways, the pieces fly by so quickly now.

Laura, look at you walk, I swear you've got eyes in my head.
I'd like to follow you down, show you around, borrow the crown you wear.

Bacon, lie on the plate, two black-eyed peas wait on the side.
Gravy, chicken and rice, isn't it nice? Tell me the price of the food.

What happens when the answers they give you aren't good enough?
What happens when it rains for eight days on your week off?
You know you can't buy tomorrow, no, it's all a matter of opening up your eyes.
And looking around cause it's all there, it's all there, I said taking the sunshine in.
