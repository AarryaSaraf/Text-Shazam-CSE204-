I forget what to ask for, there isn't anything I haven't been given.
How could I wish for anything more as I am here living in heaven?
This moment in the sun to feel the wheel turning on.

Carry me on my way, carry me on my way.
Carry me on my way, carry me on my way.

I worry about my actions, I think about the damage I do.
I've seen the coming attractions, Armageddon and Waterloo.
I tried to change my mind, I wasted precious time.

Carry me on my way, carry me on my way.
Carry me on my way, carry me on my way.

Who knows where the time goes, only everything is everything.
Feels like I'm wearing my father's clothes, singing a song my brother would sing.
I turned to hide my face, they're gone without a trace.

Carry me on my way, carry me on my way.
Carry me on my way, carry me on my way.
