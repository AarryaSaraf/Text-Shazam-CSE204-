I got holy children to show me the light, singing hallelujah, brother how about you?
Yeah, we got holy scriptures here that prove us to be right,
in believing out loud what we wish to be true.

I got stoned out neighbors to take me in tow, singing close your eyes, singing open wide.
Watch the world fall away below, let the winter wind blow,
and where will we hide when it comes from inside?

Oh, hear me now, hear me now, hear me now, hear me now, hear me now, hear me now,
hear me now, listen I got sweet, sweet music inside.

Yes, a child inside me was alone in the night,
Now has come to me, love has set my soul free.
As a man and a woman stand alone in the night, here is reason to be like sun on the sea.
