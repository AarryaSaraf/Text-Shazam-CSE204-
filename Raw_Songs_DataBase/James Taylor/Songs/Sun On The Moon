In line, in line, it's all in line, my ducks are all in a row.
They do not change, they do not move, they have nowhere to go.
I've been talking to a friend of mine, he says making money's just a waste of time.
He's a lazy gent, he don't pay no rent, he's all bent out of shape from living in a tent.
It's hard to hear what he has to say cause everyone around me is just the same way.
More, more, Daddy gimme some, gimme some more, more, Daddy gimme some more.

Some kind of funny looking money machine it is, saddest looking people that I've ever seen.
Living in a hole, body and soul, strung out on the company dole.
One for a nickel and two for a dime, time may be money but your money won't buy time.

In line, in line, it's all in a line, my ducks are all in a row,
They do not shift, they do not move, they have nowhere to go.

Me and my flea we were down by the water, fell in a hole with Superman's daughter.
Living alone, chewing on a bone, pretty as homemade sin.
She had to be high by the look in her eye, her hands were wet and her mouth was dry.
The sun on the moon, the sun on the moon, the sun on the moon made a mighty nice light.
Bow wow wow, honk your horn.

In line, in line, it's all in a line, my ducks are all in a row,
They do not shift, they do not move, they have nowhere to go.
Sometimes I'm hungry, I don't know what to do. You can take a taco to Katama too.
