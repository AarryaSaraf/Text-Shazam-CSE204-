My romance doesn't need to have a moon in the sky.
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by.
No month of May, no shining star, no hideaway, no soft guitar.

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain
nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain.
Wide-awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
'cause my romance doesn't need a thing but you.
