When Liberty Valance came to town, the women folk would hide, they'd hide.
When Liberty Valance walked around, the men would step aside
because the point of a gun was the only law that Liberty understood.
When it came to shooting straight and fast, he was mighty good.

From out of the east a stranger came, a law book in his hand.
A man, the kind of man the west would need to ease a troubled land.
because the point of a gun was the only law that Liberty understood.
When it came to shooting straight and fast, he was mighty good.

Many a man would face his gun and many a man would fall.
The man who shot Liberty Valance, he shot Liberty Valance, he was the bravest of them all.

Now the love of a woman can make a man stay on when he should go, stay on.
just trying to build a peaceful life where love is free to go.
But the point of a gun was the only law that Liberty understood.
When it came to shooting straight and fast, he was mighty good.

Alone and afraid she prayed that he'd return that fateful night, that night.
when nothing she said could keep her man from going out to fight.
But the point of a gun was the only law that Liberty understood.
When it came to shooting straight and fast, he was mighty good.

Out in the sun, two shots rang out, the shots made Liberty fall.
The man who shot Liberty Valance, he shot Liberty Valance he was the bravest of them all.
