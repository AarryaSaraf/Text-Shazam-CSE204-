Mama knows and papa knows that rock 'n roll is music now.
Baby's been cutting his teeth on Bo Diddley's, I'm a man, man,
Listen to the Wolfman howl.

See the white man sailing his ship up on the sea,
watch the white man shackle the black man to a tree.
To the invader go the fruits of war, he misses home and his boots are sore.
He has not got no roots no more, he comes for your gold, watch out for your soul.

Cause tennis shoes, and rhythm and blues are second generation
all across the nation, now, and mama knows, papa too rock 'n roll is music,
rock 'n roll is music, now.

To the invader go the fruits of war, he misses home and his boots are sore.
He has not got no roots no more, he comes for your gold, watch out for your soul.

Mama knows and papa knows that rock 'n roll is music, rock 'n roll is music, now.
