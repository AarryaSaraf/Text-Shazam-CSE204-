If I keep on talking now, I'll only start repeating myself and all I can say is
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.
If I slip and tip my hand, I'm certain to scare you away, then what would I say?
I'd be hurting, I'm certain, I'd be uncool to let you know that you're the one,
the fool who jumped the gun.

Cause I've been advised by other guys you've left behind,
your good byes are somewhat unrefined.
But if I play my role just right, tonight could be my lucky night and you could be mine.
If I present it to you with a flower in the moonlight, shiny and new,
well, you couldn't say no tonight, if I keep my heart out of sight.

If I play my role just right, tonight could be my lucky night and you could be mine.
If I present it to you with a flower in the moonlight, shiny and new,
well, you couldn't say no tonight, if I keep my heart out of sight.
