This land is a lovely green, it reminds me of my own home.
Such children I've seldom seen, even in my own home.
The sky is so bright and clean, just like my home.
Kind people as have ever been, won't you take me back to my own home?

Jump up behind me, my love, jump up behind me.
Old Dan can bear us both, jump up behind me.
We follow this road till we reach the sea, jump up behind me.
We'll catch the tide and set Dan free, jump up behind me.

I've been in this world awhile and I've seen a lot of country.
Many days and many miles, all various and sundry.
I've had my way and I've had my fun and I've had my chance to run free,
burning hot beneath the sun, freezing cold and wintry.

Jump up behind me, my love, jump up behind me.
Old Danny can carry us both, jump up behind me.
We follow this road till we reach the sea, jump up behind me.
We'll catch the tide and set old Dan free, jump up behind me.

I know now, only one thing matters in these day.
One thing, true love, love and love alone, true love.

Came out of a dream last night, thought I was back in my old home.
Mom and Dad were both still alive and the babies not yet born, no.
Felt like a festival and it felt like a Christmas morning,
felt the darkness fall away even as the world was turning on,
I mean even as the world was turning on.  La la la la la, la la la la. I say.
Jump up behind me, my love, jump up behind me.
Follow the road to the western sea...
