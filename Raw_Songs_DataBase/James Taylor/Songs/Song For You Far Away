People around me are at it again. God only knows how they do it.
One to another then back again, something keeps putting them through it.
Me, I've been watching more than fifteen years and it hasn't changed a bit.
People keep talking about a different line but it never seems to fit.

This is a song for you far away, far away. This is a song for you far away from me.
This is a song for you far away, far away. This is a song for you far away from me.

Sitting here all alone is bringing it on again, I'm gone again.
Sitting here thinking of you is driving it home again.
This is a song for you far away, far away. This is a song for you far away from me.
Open the door it takes me back, oh it takes me back.
Mention your name and I'm gone again, oh I'm gone again.
This is a song for you far away from me, far away from me.
