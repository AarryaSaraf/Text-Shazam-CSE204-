Little one done run out of money now, no, it doesn't seem to have a home.
Left to fend for yourself in the wilderness, out there living life all alone.

Whenever you're ready, you could see a dream come true.
Whenever you're ready, I'm just saying it's up to you.
Whenever you're ready, things could start looking up.
Whenever you're ready, take a big sip from the loving cup.

Making that face carved out of stone, coping real hard with a losing hand.
Sound of a dog choking on a chicken bone,
it just can't be the way that you had things planned, my friend.

Whenever you're ready, yeah, yeah, things could start to happen real fast.
Whenever you're ready, my good friend, sure we could get one built to last.
Whenever you're ready, oh, we could get it done today.
Whenever you're ready, sure enough you could come out and play.

Cold, hot, ready or not, whatever you've got.
What have you got to lose, my good friend?
Whenever you're ready, whenever you're ready, my good friend...
