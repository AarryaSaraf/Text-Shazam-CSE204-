Gosh almighty baby, yes, indeed. You supply the satisfy and I'll supply the need.
I can't help the way I feel though I know just where it leads,
you make it easy, yes you do, for a man to fall, for a man to fall.

Heaven knows I love my woman , just bound to fuss and fight.
Now I wind up on the barroom stool buying drinks and keeping tight.
But you know I've never done what's come in my mind tonight,
You make it easy, just sitting there looking good, for a man to fall, for a man to fall.

Now me and my wife, we've got the rest of our life
to make this thing right, but you and me will only see tonight.

So baby, won't you turn me down and point me out the door,
I'll head home and sleep it off just like every time before.
You keep on looking good my way, I won't hold out anymore,
you make it easy, you sure do make it easy, babe, for a man to fall, for a man to fall.

You don't have to make it so easy, babe, for another wise good man to fall,
You don't have to make it so easy, babe, no, no no,
for another wise good man to fall, you don't have to make it so easy, babe.
