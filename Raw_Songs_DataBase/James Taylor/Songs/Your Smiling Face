Whenever I see your smiling face, I have to smile myself because I love you, yes, I do.
And when you give me that pretty little pout, it turns me inside out.
There's something about you, baby, I don't know.

Isn't it amazing a man like me can feel this way,
tell me how much longer, it could grow stronger every day. Oh, how much longer?

I thought I was in love a couple of times before with the girl next door,
but that was long before I met you, now I'm sure that I won't forget you.
And I thank my lucky stars that you are who you are,
and not just another lovely lady set out to break my heart.

Isn't it amazing a man like me can feel this way,
tell me how much longer, it could grow stronger every day.

No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today, whenever I see you smile at me.
No one can tell me that I'm doing wrong today whenever I see your smiling face my way.
No one can tell me that I'm doing it wrong today.
No one can tell me that I'm doing it wrong today.
