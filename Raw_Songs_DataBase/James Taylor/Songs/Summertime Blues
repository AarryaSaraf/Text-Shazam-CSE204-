Well I'm a- gonna raise a fuss, I'm a- gonna raise a holler
I've been a- workin' all summer just to try to earn a dollar
Tried to get the car go out on a date
The boss says "No dice son, you gotta work late"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a- gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well, my mom and poppa told me "Son, you gotta earn some money
If you wanna use the car to go riding next Sunday"
Well I wouldn't go to work, I told the boss I was sick
He said "You can't use the car 'cause you didn't work a lick"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Gonna take two weeks, gonna have a fine vacation
Gonna take my problem to the United Nations
Well I called my Congressman and he said quote
"I'd like to help you son, but you're too young to vote"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do
But there ain't to cure for the summertime blues
