The sky was light and the land all dark, the sun rose up over Central Park.
I was walking home from work, Gaia.

The petal sky and the rosy dawn, the world turning on the burning sun.
Sacred wet green one we live on, Gaia.

Run, run, run, run said the automobile and it ran, run for your life, take to your heels.
Foolish school of fish on wheels, Gaia, Gaia

Turn away from your animal kind, try to leave your body just to live in your mind.
Leave your cold cruel mother earth behind, Gaia.

As if you were your own creation, as if you were the chosen nation.
The world around you, just a rude and dangerous invasion, Gaia, Gaia, Gaia.

Someone's got to stop us now, save us from us Gaia, no one's gonna stop us now.

We thought we ought to walk awhile, so we left that town in a single file.
Up and up and up, mile after mile after mile.
We reached the tree line and I dropped my pack,
sat down on my haunches and I looked back down over the mountain,
helpless and speechless and breathless, Gaia.

Pray for the forest pray for the tree, pray for the fish in the deep blue sea.
Pray for yourself and for God's sake, say one for me, poor wretched unbeliever.

Someone's got to stop us now, save us from us Gaia, no one's gonna stop us now.
