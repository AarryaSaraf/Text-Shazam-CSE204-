Lonely by day, empty and cold, only to say lo and behold.
Deep in the night, down in my dreams, glorious sight this soul has seen.

There's a well on the hill, you just can't kill for Jesus, there's a well on the hill, let it be.
Don't build no heathen temples where the Lord has done laid his hand, now,
there's a well on the hill, let it be

Everyone's talking 'bout the gospel story, some shall sink and some shall rise.
Everyone's talking 'bout the train to glory. Long, long time till it gets here to you, baby.

There's a well on the hill, you just can't kill for Jesus, there's a well on the hill, let it be.
Don't build no heathen temples where the Lord has done laid his hand, now,
there's a well on the hill, let it be
