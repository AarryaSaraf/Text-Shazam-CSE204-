Excuse me? Excuse me, yes?
Is that the way you look?  Is that the way you look?
Is that the way you look? Is that really the way that you look now?
Oh darling, darling, is that the way you look?

Is that really your eyes, is that really your hair?
Is that really the way you walk on by, are those the clothes you wear?
Oh darling, darling, is that the way you look?

Woh, baby, oh baby. Woh, baby, baby, baby, I got the question for you
Woh, baby, oh baby. Woh, baby, baby, baby, tell me now is it true?
Is that the way you look? No, no I mean is that the way you really look?
Is that the way you look, is that the way you look?

Baby, maybe I'm dreaming, but I'll be bound-
whoever wakes me up, I'm going to knock him down.
Oh darling, darling, is that the way you look?

Well I rubbed my eyes and I pinched my leg.
And I asked my friend and I shook my head,
But baby, is that the way you look?
