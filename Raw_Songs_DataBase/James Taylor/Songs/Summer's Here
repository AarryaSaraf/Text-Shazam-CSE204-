Summer's here, I'm for that. Got my rubber sandals, got my straw hat.
Got my cold beer, I'm just glad that I'm here.

Summer's here, that suits me fine. It may rain today but I don't mind.
It's my favorite time of the year and I'm glad that I'm here.

Old man wintertime, he goes so slow. It's ten degrees below, you know.
You can take your ice and snow and let my balmy breezes blow.

Yeah, the water's cold but I've been in. Baby, lose the laundry and jump on in.
I mean all God's children got skin and it's summer again.

Old man wintertime, he goes so slow. It's ten degrees below, you know.
You can take your ice and snow and let my balmy breezes blow.

Summer's here, I'm for that. Got my rubber sandals, got my straw hat.
Drinking cold beer, man, I'm just glad that I'm here.
It's my favorite time of the year and I'm glad that I'm here, yeah.
