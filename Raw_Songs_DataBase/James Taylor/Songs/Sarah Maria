Well the moon is in the ocean and the stars are in the sky.
And all that I can see is my sweet Maria's eyes.
Sarah, Sarah Maria. Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya.

Well, you know about the sugar cane that comes from way down South.
She's got one end in her hand, she's got one end in her mouth.
Come on, Sarah, Sarah Maria. Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya.

She took me out walking to the corner of the world
Where everyone was a-talking about such a pretty little girl.
Come on, Sarah, Sarah Maria. Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya.

Well the moon is in the ocean and the stars are in the sky.
And all that I can see is my sweet Maria's eyes.
Sarah, Sarah Maria. Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya.
Sarah, Sarah Maria. Sarah Maria, ya, ya, ya, ya.
