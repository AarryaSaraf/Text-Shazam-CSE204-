// Rainy Day Man //

What good is that happy lie? All you wanted from the start was to cry, girl.
It looks like another fall. Your friends they don't seem to help at all.
Now, when you're feeling kind of cold and small, just look up your rainy day man.

It does you no good to pretend, child. You've made a hole much too big to mend.
And it looks like you lose again, my friend, so go on home and look up your rainy day man.

Now rainy day man, he don't like sunshine,
he don't chase rainbows, he don't need good times, no.
Grey days rolling, then you'll see him, I said empty feeling, Lord now you need him.

All those noble thoughts, they just don't belong. You can't hide the truth with a happy song.
And since you knew where you stood all along, just go call up your rainy day man.

Now simple pleasures they all evade you, store-bought treasures, Lord none can save you.
Look for signs to ease the pain, I said ask again, go on and pray for rain.

It looks like another fall. Your good friends they don't seem to help at all.
Now, when you're feeling kind of cold and small, just look up your rainy day man,
all I'm asking just to look up your rainy day man.

// Company Man //

It seems you've been living on your own, Lonely and free.
Looking to make yourself known, same as me.
Well I see you in the public eyes, I see you're looking fine.
The boy would be a businessman and he signs the bottom line.

Singing company man, do what you can with my name.
Rock and roll man, here I am, I'm staking my claim to fame.

He's got the smiling face of a friend, still you're not quite certain you know him.
The smile turns into a grin, what do you owe him? You know you owe him.

So if there's something you do well, something you're proud of,
better to save some for yourself if that's allowed.
The crowd will never know you, you'll hardly know yourself,
they'll turn you round and blow you up till you think you're someone else.

Singing company man, do what you can with my name.
Rock and roll man, here I am, I'm staking my claim to fame.

He can turn your time to gold, you better make as much as you can my friend.
Cause his money will turn you old and they need a young man.
The job takes a young man.

// Johnnie Comes Back //

All last week and half of today, Johnnie has been a good little girl.
Trying to keep her devils at bay, watching her health return.
But she always comes back for more, hanging her head and banging my door,
Johnnie comes back again.
I said, Johnnie remember, oh, Johnnie be good, "Please give me some medicine, man."
Oh Johnnie comes back again.
Where'd she get that tear in her eye?
Whoever said she could leave me, where'd she learn to say good-bye?
She's been watching too much T.V., she only shows up for meals,
my medicine chest and my automobiles. Johnnie comes back again.
I said, Johnnie remember, oh, Johnnie be good, "Please give me some medicine, man."
Oh Johnnie comes back again.

Me, I'm just an evil demon, I'm playing on her weakness,
counting on her sickness to bring her home again.

To use me up and to rob me blind, I guess it shouldn't surprise me.
Fighting and flashing like a fish on a line, my God, she must despise me.
But she always comes back again, now it won't be long 'til she's gone again,
Johnnie comes back again.

I said, Johnnie remember, oh, Johnnie be good, "Please give me some medicine, man."
Oh Johnnie comes back again.

// Day Tripper //

I've got a good reason for taking the easy way out.
I got a good reason for taking the easy way out.
She was a day tripper, one way ticket, yeah.
It took me so long to find out but I found out.

Now she's a big teaser, she took me half the way there.
She's a big teaser, she took me half the way there.
It was a day tripper, Sunday driver now.
It took me so long but you know I found out.

You can try to please her, she only plays one night stands.
You can try just to please her, she only plays one night stands.
She was a day tripper, one way baggage, yeah.
It took me so long, well you know that I found out.
When I found out, when I found out.

I've got a good reason for taking the easy way out.
I got a good reason for taking the easy way out.
She was a day tripper, one way driver, yeah.
It took me so long to find out but I found out.

Well, I got a good reason for taking the easy way out.
Yes, I got a good reason, girl, for taking the easy way out.
She was a day tripper, one way ticket, yeah.
It took me so long to find out but I found out.

// I Will Not Lie For You //

I will not lie, I will not lie. I will not lie, I will not lie for you.

Every time I see you fooling around on him,
I can't help but remember that he calls me his friend.
It's only right for me to tell you when it's the wrong thing to do.
It's only right that you should know-
if he comes to me, I will not lie for you, no, I won't lie for you.

It's hard enough to see him stumbling blind,
I refuse to see him lose you and me at the same time.
It's only right for me to tell you when it's the wrong thing to do.
It's only right that you should know-
if he comes to me, I will not lie for you, no, I won't lie for you.

To come here as your friend and have you come on like my lover,
like to bring things to an end between myself and my brother.
If it was any other man I would not interfere
But if you come on to me again, I don't see how to stand clear.
It's only right for me to tell you when it's the wrong thing to do.
It's only right that you should know-
if he asks me, I will not lie for you, mama, I won't lie for you.

If it was any other man I would not interfere
But if you come on to me again, I don't see how to stand clear.
It's only right for me to tell you when it's the wrong thing to do.
It's only right that you should know-
If he asks me, I will not lie, I will not lie, I will not lie, I will not lie for you.

No, I won't lie for you, little girl, I won't lie for you.
No, I won't lie to him for you, I will not lie for you.
