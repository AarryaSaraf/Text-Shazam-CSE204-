// It's Growing //

Like a snowball rolling down the side of a snow covered hill, it's growing.
Like the size of a fish that the man claims broke his reel, it's growing.
Like a rosebud blooming in the warm of the summer sun, it's growing.
Like the tale by the time it's been told by more than one, wooo, it's growing.

Everyday it grows a little more than it was the day before.
My love for you just grows and grows.
Oh, how it grows and it grows.
And where it's gonna stop I'm sure, nobody knows.

(Hey, hey, hey, nobody knows)
How it grows, and it grows, and it grows.
(Nobody knows) Wooo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Nobody knows. It grows, it grows, where is it gonna stop)

Wooo, like a need in a guy to see his girl.
When she's gone away, it's growing.
Like the sadness in his little heart
When he knows that she's gone to stay, wooo, it growing.

Everyday it grows a little more than it was the day before.
My love for you just grows and grows.
Oh, how it grows and it grows.
And where it's gonna stop I'm sure, nobody knows.

(Hey, hey, hey, nobody knows) It gets a little wider.
(Nobody knows) Oh, it gets a little stronger.
(Hey, hey, hey) The feeling for each kiss, baby.
(Hey, hey, hey) Oh, it lasts a little longer, yeah.
(Hey, hey, hey) Oooo, so much... oooo, so much.
Can't you see it's growing, baby
It grows, and it grows, and it grows, and it grows.

// (I'm A) Road Runner //

Money, who needs it
Let me live a life free and easy
Put a toothbrush in my hand
Let me be a travelling man
I'm a roadrunner baby

I'm a road runner baby
Any place is my home
I'm a road runner baby
You look for me and I'll be gone

Well you can love me if you want
But I do declare
When I get restless
I've got to move somewhere

I'm a road runner baby
Just got to keep on keeping on
And I love the life I live
And I'm gonna live the life I love

Don't want no woman
To tie me down
Gotta be free baby
To roam around

All my life it's been like this
If you love me it's your own risk
When the dust hits my shoes
I got the urge to move

I'm a road runner baby
Anyplace is my home
And I love the life I live
And I'm gonna live the life I love
Roadrunner baby

// Wichita Lineman //

I am a lineman for the county and I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singin' in the wire, I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita Lineman is still on the line

I know I need a small vacation but it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you, and I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman is still on the line

And I need you more than want you, and I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman is still on the line

// Why Baby Why //

Tell me why baby, why baby, why baby why
You make me cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Lord, I can't help but love you 'til the day that I die
So tell me, why baby, why baby, why baby why

Well I got a crow I wanna pick with you
Just like last time when the feathers flew
You're runnin' wild kickin' up your heels
A-leavin' me home with a hand full of bills
Lord, I can't live without you and you know it's true
But there's no livin' with you so what'll I do
I'm goin' honky tonkin', get as tight as I can
And maybe by then you'll 'preciate a good man

Tell me why baby, why baby, why baby why
You make me cry baby, cry baby, cry baby cry
No, I can't help but love you 'til the day that I die
So tell me why baby, why baby, why baby why

Well, now I don't know, but I've heard say
That ever' little dog is a-gonna have his day
You'd better pay attention, don't you dare forget
'Cause I'm just a little bitty puppy yet
Well, I caught you honky tonkin' with my best friend
The thing to do was leave you, but I should'a left then
Now I'm too old to leave you, but I still get sore
When you come home a-feelin' for the knob on the door

Tell me why baby, why baby, why baby why
You make me cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Lord, I can't help but love you 'til the day that I die
So tell me, why baby, why baby, why baby why

Tell me, why baby, why baby, why baby why

// Some Days You Gotta Dance //

It was about five till five on Friday
We were all getting ready to go
And the boss man started screaming
And his veins began to show

He said you and you come with me
'Cause you're gonna have to stay
My heart was thumping, I was jumping
I had to get away

Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
'Cause when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little too tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance

Well, I was talking with my baby
Over a small glass of tea
He asked the loaded question
He said how do you feel about me

My mind was racin', I was pacin'
But the word just wouldn't come
And there was only one thing
Left to do I feel it comin' on

Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
'Cause when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little too tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance

Some days you gotta dance
Live it up when you get the chance
'Cause when the world doesn't make no sense
And you're feeling just a little too tense
Gotta loosen up those chains and dance

You gotta loosen up those chains and dance
Come on and loosen up those chains and dance

// Seminole Wind //

Ever since the days of old
Men would search for wealth untold
They'd dig for silver and for gold
And leave the empty holes
And way down south in the Everglades
Where the black water rolls and the saw grass waves
The eagles fly and the otters play
In the land of the Seminole

So blow, blow Seminole wind
Blow like you're never gonna blow again
I'm calling to you like a long lost friend
But I know who you are
And blow, blow from the Okeechobee
All the way up to Micanopy
Blow across the home of the Seminole
The alligators and the gar

And progress came and took its toll
And in the name of flood control
They made their plans and they drained the land
Now the glades are going dry
And the last time I walked in the swamp
I sat upon a Cypress stump
I listened close and I heard the ghost
Of Osceola cry

So blow, blow Seminole wind
Blow like you're never gonna blow again
I'm calling to you like a long lost friend
But I know who you are
And blow, blow from the Okeechobee
All the way up to Micanopy
Blow across the home of the Seminole
The alligators and the gar

// Suzanne //

Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night beside her
And you know that she's half crazy
But that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind.

And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said "All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them"
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind.

Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbour
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.

// Hound Dog //

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time.
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time.
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine.

Well they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie.
Yeah they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie.
Yeah, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine.

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time.
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time.
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine.

Well they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie.
Yeah they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie.
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine.

Well they said you was high classed,
Well, that was just a lie.
You know they said you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie.
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine.

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time.
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time.
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
You ain't no friend of mine.

// Sadie //

Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table
There was no time to eat
She said to me, Boy, hurry to Sunday school

Filled with her load of glory
We learned the Holy story
She'll always have her dreams
Despite the things this troubled world can bring

Oh, Sadie
Don't you know we love you
Sweet Sadie
Place no one above you

Sweet Sadie (Well, well, well)
Living in the past
Some times it seems so funny
But no money will turn your life around

Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than papa's old brandy
Always that needed smile
Once in awhile she would break down and cry

Some times she'd be so happy
Just being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times
Breaking the binds with just a simple song

Oh, Sadie (Oh, Sadie, baby)
Don't you know we love you (She'll love us all in a special way)
Sweet Sadie (Well, well, well)
Place no one above you

Sweet Sadie (Sweet Sadie livin' in the past)
Living in the past
Oh, she's never sinnin'
In love she's always winnin', yeah

Sadie (My, my, my, my, my)
Don't you know we love you (I love you, mama)
Sweet Sadie
Place no one above you (I just can't forget)

Sweet Sadie (How you gave me love, oh, Lord)
Living in the past
If there's a heaven up above
I know she's teaching angels how to love

Sadie (It's a mean world without you)
Don't you know we love you
Sweet Sadie (All the love you showed)
Place no one above you (Oh, I could never, ever doubt her lovely word)

Sweet Sadie
Living in the past
Ain't it funny that in the end it's not money
It's just the love you gave us all

// On Broadway //

They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway
They say there's always magic in the air
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't had enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the girls are something else on Broadway
But looking at them just gives me the blues
'Cause how ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime?
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes

Ha! They say that I won't last too long on Broadway
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say
But oh! They're dead wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway

Oh, they're dead wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway (on Broadway)
On Broadway (on Broadway)

// Summertime Blues //

Well I'm a- gonna raise a fuss, I'm a- gonna raise a holler
I've been a- workin' all summer just to try to earn a dollar
Tried to get the car go out on a date
The boss says "No dice son, you gotta work late"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a- gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well, my mom and poppa told me "Son, you gotta earn some money
If you wanna use the car to go riding next Sunday"
Well I wouldn't go to work, I told the boss I was sick
He said "You can't use the car 'cause you didn't work a lick"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Gonna take two weeks, gonna have a fine vacation
Gonna take my problem to the United Nations
Well I called my Congressman and he said quote
"I'd like to help you son, but you're too young to vote"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do
But there ain't to cure for the summertime blues

// Not Fade Away //

I'm a-gonna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know my love a-not fade away
A-well, you know my love a-not fade away

My love a-bigger than a cadillac
I try to show it and you drive a-me back
Your love for me a-got to be real
For you to know just how I feel
A love for real not fade away

I'm a-gonna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
A love to last a-more than one day
A love that's love - not fade away
A well, a-love that's love - not fade away
