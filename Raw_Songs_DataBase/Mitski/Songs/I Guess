I guess, I guess
I guess this is the end
I'll have to learn
To be somebody else

It's been you and me
Since before I was me
Without you I don't yet know
Quite how to live

If I could keep
Anything of you
I would keep
Just this quiet after you

It's still as a pond
I am staring into
From here I can say
Thank you
From here I can tell you
Thank you
