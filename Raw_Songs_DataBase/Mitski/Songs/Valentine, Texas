Let's step carefully into the dark
Once we're in, I'll remember my way around
Who will I be tonight
Who will I become tonight
I'll show you who my sweetheart's never met
Wet teeth, shining eyes
Glimmering by a fire

Let's drive out to where dust devils are made
By dancing ghosts as they kick up clouds of sand
Where clouds look like mountains
Clouds look like mountains
Let me watch those mountains from underneath
And maybe they'll finally float off of me
