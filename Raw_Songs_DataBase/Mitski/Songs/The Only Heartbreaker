If you would just make one mistake
What a relief that would be
But I think for as long as we're together
I'll be the only heartbreaker

I'll be the only heartbreaker
I'll be the only heartbreaker

So I'll be the loser in this game
I'll be the bad guy in the play
I'll be the water main that's burst and flooding
You'll be by the window, only watching

I'll be the only heartbreaker
I'll be the only heartbreaker

(I apologize)
(You forgive me)
(I apologize)
(You forgive me)

And make me the only heartbreaker
So I'll be the only heartbreaker
