Hmm
Hmm

Treasure hunter, you are dead
The light of the world is fading
You cannot see the other end
Your body's lost all feeling
Those creatures of your woken mind
Don't fear them or their hunger
Forgive the sea, follow the tide
With the monsters on your shoulder

Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down
Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down

Oh, hunter, if you didn't want
The beautiful so badly
Perhaps you would've found it
In your spirit singing softly
But hunter, you were human
Don't forget it and go safely
And I, I'll live without you
Though the struggle will be daily

Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down
Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down

Oh, oh
Oh, ooh

Treasure hunter, you are dead
The light of the world is fading
