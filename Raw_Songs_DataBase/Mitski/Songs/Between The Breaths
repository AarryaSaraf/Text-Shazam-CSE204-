As you look to the stars
Oh, you could find
Illuminated in scars
A face aligned
I am saving the space
Between the breaths
I am making your place
Between the breaths

As the flame is to snow
First love to last
I will laugh in your face
Like shattered glass
I'm saving the space
Between the breaths
We are saving a place
Between the breaths

Between the breaths
Between the breaths
Between the breaths
Between the breaths
I've seen it
Oh, and I'll breathe it
I've seen it
Oh, and I'll breathe it
(Between the breaths)

I never said where I came from
You never asked what I was made of
You didn't need to know
You already know
I said it even so
You didn't need to know
You never said you couldn't see me
Never a hint you couldn't be me
I could never say
I didn't need to say
Now I'm fine although
It was touch-and-go

Counting the breaths
Until you
Oh, la la
Oh, la la
Oh, la la
Oh, la la

The distance between us
Solved by a shrug
Just a shrug of dark matter
Just a shrug of dark matter

You thought you saw a new star
You caught a fright
You think you wish you may
You wish you might
Be saving the space
Between the breaths
We are saving a place
Between the breaths

I've seen it
Oh, and I'll breathe it
I've seen it
Oh, and I'll breathe it
Between the breaths
Between the breaths
Between the breaths

You never said you couldn't see me
Never a hint you couldn't be me
I could never say
I didn't need to say
I said it even though
You didn't need to know

A sky full of messages
Sealed up in bottles
Smash the omens
Our days are not numbered
Scream in my mouth
I'll barely hear you

Flame to snow
First love to last
Brand on brow
First love to now
Questions posed
Uncut the throat
You don't have to ask
First love to last

Let's meet at the same time
Every night
Starlight on skin
Is a million years old
You never asked my age.
You never questioned my rage
Let's meet at the same time
Every morning
The blood in my gut
Is a thousand years old
But you are the sweetest infection
You are the sweetest infection

I could never know
I didn't need to know
You said it even though
You could never know

Oh, no no oh
Oh, no no oh
Oh, no no oh
