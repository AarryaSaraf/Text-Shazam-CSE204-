I'll live in the bathtub
It's cool and clean
It's smooth and it's steady
It's all that I need

I broke our belongings
They're all on the floor
The room is now empty
Nothing left to throw

All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch

All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch

I'll live in the bathtub
Surrounded by tiles
All so square and so steady
I will die in their cool, cool arms

I broke what you gave me
But you kept giving more
And I'm sorry for taking
But I keep wanting more, more, more

All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch

All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But, Humpty Dumpty, you're much too much
Too frail for me to touch

Humpty Dumpty
It's much too much

All the eggshells are on the ground
