I get mean when I'm nervous like a bad dog
I get mean when I'm nervous like a bad dog
I want to jump into blue water
And I miss riding horses, I miss running fast
I miss riding horses, I miss running fast
I was meant for running fast
I pretended you were mine, it made me calm, babe

I am cruel, I am gentle, I can make you laugh
I am cruel, I am gentle, I can make you laugh
I've loved many boys, I've loved many girls
I don't think about the past, it's always there anyway
Don't think about the past, always there anyway
And I will never die, I will never die
I will never die, I will never die
I will never die, I will never die
I will never die, I will never die

I've preemptively blocked all the exits
I've preemptively blocked all the exits
So I will burn in this movie theater, hey
