The baddy man was creepin' through the alleys of your mind
Sneakin' an' a schemin' just to see what he could find
Creepin' an' a crawlin' through the wanton avenues
Walkin' through your secrets like them expert sneaks can do

What those dead men say that they do
Will never be the absolute truth
'Cause the baddy man was creepin' through the alleys of your mind
Oh yeah, I tell ya

You still there, robot lady?
'Cause I hate singing alone

Oh yeah, what those dead men say that they do
Will never be the absolute truth
'Cause the baddy man was creepin' through the alleys of your mind
Oh yeah, I tell ya
