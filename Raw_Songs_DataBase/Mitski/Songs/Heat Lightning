Heat lightning
Running outside the window
I've laid awake since 1:00 and, now, it's 4 o'clock
Though I've held on
Can't carry it much longer
On the ceiling dancing are the things all come and gone

And there's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
So, I give it up to you
I hope that's okay
There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you
I surrender

Heat lightning
Watch it from my doorstep
Sleeping eyelid of the sky
Flutters in a dream
Well I've held on
But feel a storm approaching
Trees are swaying in the wind like sea anemones

And there's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
Can I give it up to you?
Would that be okay?
There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you
I surrender

There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you
I surrender
