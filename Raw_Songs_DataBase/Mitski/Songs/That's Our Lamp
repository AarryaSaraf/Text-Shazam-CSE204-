We fought again
I ran out the apartment
You say you love me
I believe you do
But I walk down and up and down
And up and down this street
'Cause you just don't like me
Not like you used to

That's our lamp
It shines like a big moon
We may be ending
I'm standing in the dark
Looking up into our room
Where you'll be waiting for me
Thinking that's where you loved me
That's where you loved me

Thinking that's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
