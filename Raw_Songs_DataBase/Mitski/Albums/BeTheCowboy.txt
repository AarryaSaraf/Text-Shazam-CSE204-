// Geyser //

You're my number one
You're the one I want
And I've turned down
Every hand that has beckoned me to come
You're my number one
You're the one I want
And I've turned down
Every hand that has beckoned me to come

'Cause you're the one I got
You're the one I got
So I'll keep turning down the hands
That beckon me to come

Though I'm a geyser, feel it bubbling from below
Hear it call, hear it call, hear it call to me, constantly
And hear the harmony only when it's harming me
It's not real, it's not real, it's not real enough

But I will be the one you need
The way I can't be without you
I will be the one you need
I just can't be without you

// Why Didn't You Stop Me? //

I know that I ended it, but
Why won't you chase after me?
You know me better than I do
So why didn't you stop me?

Why didn't you stop me
Why didn't you stop me
And paint it over?

I look for a picture of you
To keep in my pocket
But I can't seem to find one
Where you look how I remember

Look how I remember
Look how I remember
Paint it over

// Old Friend //

We nearly drowned
For such a silly thing
Someone who loves me now
Better than you
And that pretty friend is
Finally yours, and
I'll be around on Sunday, if

You'll meet me at Blue Diner
I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take anything you wanna give me, baby

I haven't told anyone
Just like we promised
Have you?
Every time I drive through the city where you're from
I squeeze a little

Meet me at Blue Diner
I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take anything you wanna give me, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
Blue Diner, I'll take anything you wanna give me, baby

// A Pearl //

You're growing tired of me
You love me so hard and I still can't sleep
You're growing tired of me
And all the things I don't talk about

Sorry, I don't want your touch
It's not that I don't want you
Sorry, I can't take your touch

It's just that I fell in love with a war
Nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around
Every night, just to watch it glow
Every night, baby, that's where I go

Sorry, I don't want your touch
It's not that I don't want you
Sorry, I can't take your touch

There's a hole that you fill
You fill, you fill

But it's just that I fell in love with a war
And nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around
Every night, just to watch it glow
Every night, baby, that's where I go
Just to watch it glow

// Lonesome Love //

I call you, to see you again
So I can win, and this can finally end
Spend an hour on my makeup
To prove something

Walk up in my high heels
All high and mighty
And you say, "Hello"
And I lose

'Cause nobody butters me up like you, and
Nobody fucks me like me

In the morning, in a taxi
I'm so very paying for
Why am I lonely for lonesome love?
Why am I lonely for lonesome love?
Why am I lonely?

// Remember My Name //

I gave too much of my heart tonight
Can you come to where I'm staying and make some extra love?
That I can save 'til tomorrow's show

'Cause I need somebody to remember my name
After all that I can do for them is done
I need someone to remember me

I need something bigger than the sky
Hold it in my arms and know it's mine
Just how many stars will I need to hang around me
To finally call it heaven?

I need somebody to remember my name
After all that I can do for them is done
I need someone to remember me

I need something bigger than the sky
Hold it in my arms and know it's mine
Just how many stars will I need to hang around me
To finally get somewhere I can be all done
Somewhere like heaven

// Me And My Husband //

I steal a few breaths from the world for a minute
And then I'll be nothing forever
And all of my memories
And all of the things I have seen will be gone
With my eyes, with my body, with me

But me and my husband
We are doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together

And I'm the idiot with the painted face
In the corner, taking up space
But when he walks in, I am loved, I am loved

Me and my husband
We are doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We are doing better

// Come Into The Water //

Come into the water!
Do you wanna be my baby?
Are you waiting to touch me?
You look so good, but I keep my hands
'Til you come into the water

Maybe I'm the same as all those men
Writing songs of all they're dreaming
But would you tell me if you want me?
'Cause I can't move until you show me

I didn't know I had a dream
I didn't know until I saw you
So would you tell me if you want me?
'Cause I can't move until you show me

// Nobody //

My God, I'm so lonely
So I open the window
To hear sounds of people
To hear sounds of people

Venus, planet of love
Was destroyed by global warming
Did its people want too much too?
Did its people want too much?

And I don't want your pity
I just want somebody near me
Guess I'm a coward
I just want to feel alright

And I know no one will save me
I just need someone to kiss
Give me one good honest kiss
And I'll be alright

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody, nobody

I've been big and small and
Big and small and
Big and small again
And still nobody wants me
Still nobody wants me

And I know no one will save me
I'm just asking for a kiss
Give me one good movie kiss
And I'll be alright

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, no

// Pink In The Night //

I glow pink in the night in my room
I've been blossoming alone over you
And I hear my heart breaking tonight
I hear my heart breaking tonight
Do you hear it too?
It's like a summer shower
With every drop of rain singing
"I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you!"

I could stare at your back all day
I could stare at your back all day
And I know I've kissed you before, but
I didn't do it right
Can I try again, try again, try again
Try again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again?

// Washing Machine Heart //

Toss your dirty shoes in my washing-machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside
I'm not wearing my usual lipstick
I thought maybe we would kiss tonight
Baby, will you kiss me already, and
Toss your dirty shoes in my washing-machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside

Baby, though I've closed my eyes
I know who you pretend I am
I know who you pretend I am

But do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
Do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
Do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?

// Blue Light //

Somebody kiss me, I'm going crazy
I'm walking 'round the house naked
Silver in the night
Singing, "Do-do, do-do..."

Out there I'm a sharp knife
Are you that blue light?
Are you that blue light?
Are you that blue light?
Are you?

"Do-do, do-do..."

// Two Slow Dancers //

Does it smell like a school gymnasium in here?
It's funny how they're all the same
It's funny how you always remember
And we've both done it all a hundred times before
It's funny how I still forgot

It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is
And it is
We're just two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out

And the ground has been slowly pulling us back down
You see it on both our skin
We get a few years and then it wants us back

It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is
And it is
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
But we're two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out
Two slow dancers, last ones out
