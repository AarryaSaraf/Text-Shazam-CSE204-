I got a kindhearted mama
Do anything in this world for me
I got a kindhearted mama
Do anything in this world for me
But these evil-hearted women
Man they will not let me be

I love my baby
My baby don't love me
I love my baby, oooh
My baby don't love me
I really love that woman,
Can't stand to leave her be

Now there ain't but the one thing
Makes Mister Johnson drink
Its worried bout how you treat me baby
I begin to think
Oh babe, my life don't feel the same
You breaks my heart,	
When you call me Mister So-and-So's name

She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
You wells to kill me, baby
As to have it on your mind

Some day, some day 
I would shake your hand good-bye
Some day, some day, hee
I would shake you hand good-bye
I can't give you anymore of my lovin'
'Cause I just ain't satisfied
