Get off the car
Kick his chain
Kick his pride, get him soaked, hit, run
Lift up your toes
In my mouth
And we can make love
And we can go

And we can go
And we can go
We're covered by the sacred fire
When you come to me, you come to broke

Get off the car
Kick his chain
Kick his pride, get him soaked, hit, run
Lift up your toes in my mouth
And we can make love
And we can go

And we can go
And we can go
And we can go
And we can go
We're covered by the sacred fire
When you come to me, you come to broke

Without a doubt 
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without
Without a doubt 
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Without a doubt

We're covered by the sacred fire
When you come to me, you come to me broke
Guilty girl, guilty boy
Get to make out, him chocked with mousse
Lift up your toes in my mouth
And we can make love
And we can go
Guilty girl, guilty boy
Get to make out, him chocked with mousse
Lift up your toes in my mouth
And we can make love
And we can go
