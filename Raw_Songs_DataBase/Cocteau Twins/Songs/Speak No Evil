My soul I sold
I can't forget to ask
There's nothing movin' it again
Wolf thirst said me

Hear no, see no, speak no evil
Hear no, see no, speak no evil

I heal, I hurt
I can't forget to ask
There's nothing movin' it again
Wolf thrist said me

Hear no, see no, speak no evil
Hear no, see no, speak no evil
Hear no, see no, speak no evil
Hear no, see no, speak no evil
