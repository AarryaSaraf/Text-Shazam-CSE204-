Hey, the chances I must waste 
Hey, ever dirge, even their moth got a jar 
Is what it takes 
Is what it takes 
Is what it takes 
Is what it takes 

Paper chase is on 
These are on my speed 
For you are but 
But around the fold 
On the charnel, by your gin trap 
Paper chase is on 
These are on my space 

Paper chase is on (hey, the chances I must waste)
Hey, the chances I must waste
These are on my speed 
For you are but 
But around the fold 
On the charnel, by your gin trap (hey, ever dirge, even their moth got a jar)
Oh, you are but ever by the jar
Paper chase is on 
These are on my space 
I watch him trail
I watch him trail
I watch him trail
I watch him trail
