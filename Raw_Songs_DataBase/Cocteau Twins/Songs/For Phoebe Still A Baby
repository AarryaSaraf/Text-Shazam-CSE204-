Little Phoebe
Who I've never seen
Had you asked, I'd be right out
And maybe
In a good time
Phoebe, then I'll tuck you in

How is it
(Listen angel)
You do
(Listen angel)
Run along and shine the world
(This night, angel)
Don't tell
(Please smile on, angel)
Run along and shine the whole night away

And, say
And maybe
In a good time
Phoebe then I'll tuck you in
Little Phoebe
Who I've never seen
Had you asked, I'd be right out

For love feels
(Listen angel)
Feels
(Listen angel)
Run along and shine the world
(This night, now, angel)
It's all the same
(Listen, now, angel)
Run along and shine the whole world, angel
How is it
(Listen angel)
You do
(Listen angel)
Run along and shine the world
(This night, angel)
Don't tell
(Please smile on, angel)
Run and shine the whole world now, my angel
