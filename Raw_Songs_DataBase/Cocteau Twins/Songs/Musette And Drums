Did it again
Real fast for a genius
Meridienne
Were genius too, ah
Writes a song
Their favourite genius
Somebody's 
She turned thirteen oh

Tragedienne
Am I pretty enough

Musette and drums
I'm also genius
Somebody's 
She turned thirteen oh

Writes a song
Their favourite genius
Somebody's
She turned thirteen oh

Tragedienne
Am I pretty enough

Musette and drums
They are genius too
