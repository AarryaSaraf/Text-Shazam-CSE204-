He's the droplets
He's that droplet on my truth
He's the spangle
He is that spangle maker

Oh, for that's
Awful that worked it shattering heads
She is his
She's his spangle baby
And the rest made sure it's the droplet

Singing
Broke and winded
Broke and winded
Whistling

Singing
Broke and winded
Broke and winded
Whistling

He's the droplets
He's that droplet on my truth
He's the spangle
He is that spangle maker
And the rest made sure it's the droplet

Singing
Broke and winded
Broke and winded
Whistling

Singing
Broke and winded
Broke and winded
Whistling

He's the droplets
He's that droplet on my truth
He's the spangle
He is that spangle maker
And the rest made sure it's the droplet

Singing
Broke and winded
Broke and winded
Whistling

Singing
Broke and winded
Broke and winded
Whistling

He's the droplets
He's that droplet on my truth
He's the spangle
He is that spangle maker

His part of the plan, it hadn't gone and there you are
It scattered then, it didn't bond and there you are
Oh, perhaps it's just the droplet singing
Broke and winded, I whistle and there you hide

His part of the plan, it hadn't gone and there you are
It scattered then, it didn't bond and there you are
Oh, perhaps it's just the droplet singing
Broke and winded, I whistle and there you hide

His part of the plan, it hadn't gone and there you are
It scattered then, it didn't bond and there you are
Oh, perhaps it's just the droplet singing
Broke and winded, I whistle and there you hide
