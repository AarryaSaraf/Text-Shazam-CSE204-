They are beaten
You'd feel danger there

Through the edged are beaten
You'd feel danger there

How heavy you are on this faded hatch
Tinderbox of a heart left a shell is all

How heavy you are on this faded hatch
Tinderbox of a heart left a shell is all

How heavy you are on this faded hatch
Tinderbox of a heart left a shell is all

Bleed in your fate's ground through the edge
It's so bloody and blunt of big crystal eyes
How heavy you are; it's fading your hatch
Tinderbox of a heart left a shell is all

Bleed in your fate's ground through the edge
It's so bloody and blunt of big crystal eyes
How heavy you are; it's fading your hatch
Tinderbox of a heart left a shell is all
