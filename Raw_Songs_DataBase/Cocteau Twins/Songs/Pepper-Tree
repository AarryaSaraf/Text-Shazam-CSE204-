Gotta, gotta, gotta gain his voice
On pepper tree
Harden, harden, harden dont's and wont's
My easel she

You gotta, gotta, gotta gain his voice
On purple scotch
Harden, harden, harden dont's and wont's
My easel touch

Gain his voice
On pepper tree
Heart's been swallowed whole
Who's real muse and she

You gotta, gotta, gotta gain his voice
On purple scotch
Harden, harden, harden dont's and wont's
My easel touch

Gain his voice
On pepper tree
Heart's been swallowed whole
Who's real muse and she

Heart's been swallowed whole
Who's real muse and she

You gotta, gotta, gotta gain his voice
On purple scotch
Harden, harden, harden dont's and wont's
My easel touch
