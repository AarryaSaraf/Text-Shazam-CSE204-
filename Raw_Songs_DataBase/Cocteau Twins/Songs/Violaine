Ik does a dashik dozen
Ik does a yield gig does
Ik does alone cheyenne
Mad at them who tease him scrawling

And I knew deeper darlin
Idiom a deus is dos
Indeared look he loves it
Your elan new sub dearie

Says your supper should shout
As you eat up seisured
Evil oh it will 
Evolve evil vamos a la

Ik does a dashik dozen
Ik does a yield gig does
Ik does alone cheyenne
Mad at them who tease him scrawling

He tear them off, he tear them off 
He tear them off and eat the meal too
Oh eat off your toe
As you eat up
Slow eat that meal, slow eat that meal
Slow eat that meal, no way down
No way down, you're close
Chew too slow, you're close
And how can you mock me
How can you be in the nude
When you're my friend
When you're my friend
He tear them off, he tear them off
ik does
Oh eat off your toe

I know I need to tell you
All I've seen, all i catch
Put in the poster girl
And shake like dogs of tiding scholar

Ik does a dashik dozen
Ik does a yield gig does
Ik does alone cheyenne
Mad at them who tease him scrawling

He tear them off, he tear them off 
He tear them off and eat the meal too
Oh eat off your toe
As you eat up
Slow eat that meal, slow eat that meal
Slow eat that meal, no way down
No way down, you're close
Chew too slow, you're close
And how can you mock me
How can you be in the nude
When you're my friend
When you're my friend
He tear them off, he tear them off
Ik does
Oh eat off your toe
