You become a world for his
New heart, accepting
And you can work
Through the pain
Or enjoy the pleasure
Commit to the work of both
If your love has energy
You have chemistry
And you can work
Through the pain
Or enjoy the pleasure
You can you can you can work
Through the pain
Or enjoy the pleasure
You can you can you can work
Through the pain
And come to peace
It's frightening
Exciting

Something shakes of forlorn understanding
The truth is not perfect
But it fools and confuses
Every moment vaguely
You can you can you can work
Through the pain 
Or enjoy the pleasure
You can you can you can work
Through the pain
And come to peace
I remember my secret
I write it down and then I tell you it
It's not harm free
Outside of myself
What has saved me?

C-c-c-c-can work through the pain
Or enjoy the pleasure
You c-c-c-c-c-c-can work through the pain
And come to peace
You can work through the pain
Or enjoy the pleasure
