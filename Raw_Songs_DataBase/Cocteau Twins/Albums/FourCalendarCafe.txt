// Know Who You Are At Every Age //

It seems things are indictive to, 
A distinct desire to observe such, heal such
Behave such that makes this hard for me
I'm not real and I deny, I won't heal unless I cry
I can't grieve, so I won't grow, I won't heal 'til I let it go
I'm not real and I deny, I won't heal unless I cry
It seems things are indicative to, A distinct desire to
Observe such, Heal such
Behave such that makes this hard for me

I'm not real and I deny, I won't heal unless I cry
I can't grieve, so I won't grow, I won't heal 'til I let it go

I'm not real and I deny, I won't heal unless I cry
I can't grieve, so I won't grow, I won't heal 'til I let it go

Cry, cry, cry 'til you know why, I lost myself, identify
Cry, cry, cry 'til you know why, I lost myself, identify

I'm not real and I deny, I won't heal unless I cry
I can't grieve, so I won't grow, I won't heal 'til I let it go

// Evangeline //

Don't settle for letting someone else define you
Know who you are at every age
What impression am I making?
I see me as other people see me

There is no going back
I can't stop feeling now
I am not the same, I'm growing up again
I am not the same
I'm growing up again
There's no going back I can't stop feeling now

I had to fantasize
I was a princess, Mum and Dad were Queen and King
I ought to have what feeling?
I see me as other people see me

There is no going back
I can't stop feeling now
I am not the same, I'm growing up again
I am not the same 
I'm growing up again
There's no going back I can't stop feeling now

Feeling now

There is no going back, and
I can't stop feeling now
I am not the same, I'm growing up again
I am not the same
I'm growing up again
There's no going back I can't stop feeling now

I had to fantasize
Just to survive
I was a famous artist
Everybody took me seriously

Even those who did
Never understood me
I had to fantasize
Just to survive

Are you the right man for me?
Are you safe? Are you my friend?
Are you the right man for me?
Are you safe? Are you my friend?

Aliveness
Exploration
Fulfillment
Creativity

It may be diverting
For some part of him

Are you the right man for me?
Are you safe? Are you my friend?
Or are you toxic for me?
Will you betray my confidence?

Are you the right man for me?
Are you safe? Are you my friend?
Or are you toxic for me?
Will you betray my confidence?

Naming things is empowering
I balance, walk, and coordinate myself, alive
Aliveness energy

Healthy dependence
And healthy independence
And healthy assurances
This love's a nameless dream
And healthy boundaries
And how long would you miss me

Are you the right man for me?
Are you safe? Are you my friend?
Or are you toxic for me?
Will you mistreat me
Or betray all my confidence?

Are you the right man for me?

Or betray all my confidence?

Or betray all my confidence?

// Theft And Wandering Around Lost //

The man is an offender
He took my value
And I give back his shame
And I take back my power
My body is my own
My body is mine alone
And I deserve protection
And I can create it for you
Is this what my body said?

"Use me
Drain me
Fall around me"
Is this what my body said?
"Engulf me
I'm already dead"

I have a feel of things
Cry and shakes the wall for you
And I am moving to poison love 
And drown the stars above you
My body is my own
My body is mine alone
And I deserve protection
And I can create it for you
Is this what my body said?

"Use me
Drain me
Fall around me"
Is this what my body said?
"Engulf me
I'm already dead"

Keep cutting myself on the edges of reality
Keep cutting myself on the edges of reality

Is this what my body said? 
Keep cutting myself on the edges of
"Use me Reality
Drain me
Fall around me"
Is this what my body said? 
Keep cutting myself on the edges of
"Engulf me Reality
I'm already dead"

// Oil Of Angels //

First, he's inched her latch down
Anxious, her hand begs, and now my distraction
Distraction
I will learn, To focus on
Oh, you hoo hoo..., Cause you won't

Recognize it, stablize it
Things take-take me
To exception look for respect
Respect
Down- down there
You're not a nice track footfall
Round
Will we still hold, rain
Things we couldn't do 
Strive, for me to leave
Rights of her, Rights
Treasure her, treasure
Her freshness
First 
He's inched her latch down
Anxious
Oh, her hand begs
And my distraction
Distraction
I will learn to, I will learn
Focus on you, to focus on
You hoo hoo... 
Cause you won't

Recognize it, recognize
Stablize it, stablize it
He even finds a way
Supreme, man improves
Lkie what might see
Her life for everyone
Will it still hold
Rain
Things we couldn't do
Strive
For me to give
Rights of her
Rights
Treasure her
Treasure
Her freshness
I will learn
To focus on you
You hoo hoo...
Cause you won't

// Squeeze-Wax //

There is a wait and that's what hurt
Makes it happen, fill the gap
It spreads her hair all about
My steps
If I do it slow

No, no threats
No, no fights
No fantasies
Lucy

I hurry back to make him feel Lucy, Lucy, Lucy
I have to make him feel better Lucy, Lucy, Lucy
And oh, I know, no I can't
Freshness 
You amaze me

No, no threats
No, no fights
No fantasies
Lucy

No, no threats
No, no fights
No fantasies
Lucy

How he'll never come to freshness 
You amaze me
How he'll never come to freshness
You amaze me
You amaze me
You amaze me

How he'll never come to freshness
You amaze me
Looking at love as faces I could give this
You amaze me
No threats, no fights, no fantasies
You amaze me
You amaze me
You amaze me

No, no threats No threats, no fights
No, no fights No threats, no fights
No fantasies No fights, no fantasies
Lucy

No, no, no threats
No, no threats No fights, Lucy, Lucy, Lucy, Lucy
No, no fights 
No fantasies No threats, no fights 
No fantasies No threats no fights
Lucy No fights, no fantasies
Lucy, Lucy, Lucy

// My Truth //

You become a world for his
New heart, accepting
And you can work
Through the pain
Or enjoy the pleasure
Commit to the work of both
If your love has energy
You have chemistry
And you can work
Through the pain
Or enjoy the pleasure
You can you can you can work
Through the pain
Or enjoy the pleasure
You can you can you can work
Through the pain
And come to peace
It's frightening
Exciting

Something shakes of forlorn understanding
The truth is not perfect
But it fools and confuses
Every moment vaguely
You can you can you can work
Through the pain 
Or enjoy the pleasure
You can you can you can work
Through the pain
And come to peace
I remember my secret
I write it down and then I tell you it
It's not harm free
Outside of myself
What has saved me?

C-c-c-c-can work through the pain
Or enjoy the pleasure
You c-c-c-c-c-c-can work through the pain
And come to peace
You can work through the pain
Or enjoy the pleasure

// Essence //

I don't have to be specific when I wanna hug you
You had a natural right to be born to become
Yes having my small niece becomes acceptable to me
I'd feel angry had I lost you 
And can't imagine where you might be

Where do baby leaves go when they die
Oh, why I do not mourn
God is a feeling of loving yourself
You're precious to me, you know that

Stretch in your arms
Wrap 'em 'round tight
Loving myself
With all my might

Where do baby leaves go when they die
Oh, why I do not mourn
God is a feeling of loving yourself
You're precious to me, you know that

Take a look inside you'll see
See how I'm doing
A message, something says to me
Tells me I'm right
So you want a potion to send me away
Daddy, my love, cannot get in today

// Summerhead //

My dreams end with us
My tears have run away
Our goal, goal collapsed
Energy of lonesome goal
May pushes, leaves and never feels
Shame casts offense
Shame casts her face
Star reason starring of the place

Safe at last
Seeing my thoughts in order
Safe, fallen down this way
I will be just what I am

Steal more treasures, steal more gifts
This'll size creative lies
Until we drop
It won't free you to go look for the key
My consciousness don't look away
What might keep them, but a slave
What might keep them, but a slave
My truth's not even, even half of what's

Safe at last
Seeing my thoughts in order
Safe, fallen down this way
I will be just what I am

Safe at last
Seeing my thoughts in order
Safe, fallen down this way
I will be just what I am

Safe at last
Seeing my thoughts in order
Safe at last

Safe at last
Seeing my thoughts in order
Safe, fallen down this way
I will be just what I am

Safe at last
Seeing my thoughts in order
Safe, fallen down this way
I will be just what I am

// Pur //

I'm glad you are a girl
I'm pleased to know you
I like you for you
I'm happy you're growing up

Reach and you won't lose me
Destroy the objective, but still sur-vur-vive
You are angry and that's okay

Forgetful or pretending
Tired, ill, or angry, or cold
More assured of what to do
But I do care for you (What a beautiful gift for me)

Reach and you won't lose me
Destroy the objective, but still survive
You are angry and that's okay... yes
I am not afraid of your anger
What do you need? What do you want?
I love you and I know that you can figure it out

Reach and you won't lose me
Destroy the objective, but still survive
You are angry and that's okay... yes
I am not afraid of your anger
What do you need? What do you want?
I love you and I know that you can figure it out

Reach and you won't lose me
Destroy the objective, but still survive
You are angry and that's okay... yes
I am not afraid of your anger
What do you need? What do you want?
I love you and I know that you can figure it out
