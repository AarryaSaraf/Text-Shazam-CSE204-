California
It crossed my mind
Once we were pressed into the
Love we were pressed into the breeze up on the mountain
I was by your side

Do you remember
A conversation with our heads against the pillow?
Dust my shoes before I enter through your doorstep
I was on your side

Coming in like a western wind
Do you feel home from all directions
First bloom, you know it's Spring
Reminding me love that it's all connected
(The wind is coming)
Coming in like a western wind

A jubilation
A celebration
Take me back into your corner
To the center of the room, we made a dance floor
I was charmed to let go

Coming in like a western wind
Do you feel home from all directions
First bloom, you know it's Spring
Reminding me love that it's all connected
(The wind is coming)
Coming in like a western wind

But could you give me peace of mind
If I return to you in time, my golden arrow
Mmm

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Coming in like a western wind
Do you feel home from all directions
First bloom, you know it's Spring
Reminding me love that it's all connected
(The wind is coming)
Coming in like a western wind

Coming in like a western wind
Do you feel home from all directions
First bloom, you know it's Spring
Reminding me love that it's all connected
(The wind is coming)
Coming in like a western wind

Coming in like a western wind
Do you feel home from all directions
First bloom, you know it's Spring
Reminding me love that it's all connected
(The wind is coming)
Coming in like a western wind
