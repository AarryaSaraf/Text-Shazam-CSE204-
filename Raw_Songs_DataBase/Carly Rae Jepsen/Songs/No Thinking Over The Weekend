I was looking for you on the beach
When it's good, was it always out of reach?
In the hotel, someone sent me flowers
Getting dressed now, meet you in an hour

London, sunset ocean
Feeling it, stealing kisses from your neck
Summer haze, the nights are getting hotter
Pick me up when you're ready for the water

Do you think about star signs?
Because I think I saw Jupiter
Dive into the black sky

No thinking over the weekend
(Our lips have no secrets)
No thinking over the weekend
(This love has no limits)

I'm in this spiritual dream and-
(Dream and-, dream and-, dream and)
No thinking
(Thinking, thinking, thinking)

Holiday, take the train off the track
The windows were closed, so we keep the door open
Everyone waved at us

Do you think about star signs?
Because I think I saw Jupiter
Dive into the black sky

No thinking over the weekend
(Our lips have no secrets)
No thinking over the weekend
(This love has no limits)

I'm in this spiritual dream and-
(Dream and-, dream and-, dream and)
No thinking
(Thinking, thinking, thinking)

I'm in this spiritual dream and-
(Dream and-, dream and-, dream and)
No thinking
(Thinking, thinking, thinking)

Tried but I couldn't get away (Tried but I couldn't get away with it)
Tried but I couldn't get away (Tried but I couldn't get away with it)
No thinking over the weekend
No thinking over the weekend
I'm in this spiritual dream and-
(Dream and-, dream and-, dream and)
No thinking
(Thinking, thinking, thinking)
