Every morning as I go walking by
I feel you looking, that's why I take my time
Oh oh, yeah

I can see what you wanna do to me
You can feel it, something's gonna break
Well, I'm in if you're in
Let's make a big mistake

Talk to me
Why won't you talk to me?
Can't you see I'm burning up?
When you look like that and I'm looking right back
Why don't you talk to me?
Walk with me, baby

When he's singing his song
While all the young girls sigh
And we'll be wearing those things
That make a grown man cry
Oh oh, yeah

I can see what you wanna do to me
You can feel it, something's gonna break
Well, I'm in if you're in
Let's make a big mistake

Talk to me
Why won't you talk to me?
Can't you see I'm burning up?
When you look like that and I'm looking right back
Why don't you talk to me?
Walk with me, baby

Come on, take me away
I've been yours from the start
Summer nights, summer days
I'll be your summer heart
Come on, take me away
I've been yours from the start

When it's love like that and you look like that

Talk to me
Why won't you talk to me?
Can't you see I'm burning up?
When you look like that and I'm looking right back
Why don't you talk to me?
Walk with me, baby

Come on, take me away
I've been yours from the start
Summer nights, summer days
I'll be your summer heart
Come on, take me away
I've been yours from the start

Talk to me
Why won't you talk to me?
Can't you see I'm burning up?
When you look like that and I'm looking right back
Why don't you talk to me?
Talk to me
Why don't you talk to me?
