Sunshine, somewhere in Mexico
Long day, I didn't feel so good
Lonely, am I being sensitive?
Blue eyes, you were the sensitive one
Just say this isn't happening
Do do do do do do do do do

It's too late for that flight
To see you, how can this be life?
How can this be life?

I can feel the sun on you
Warm me up the way you do
After all the clouds have dried
Here's a jar of tears I've cried
Keep it in a sacred place
Hold me in your humble grace
'Cause I can feel the darkness sometimes too

Moonlight, stars in the water glow
Swim out, baptize me indigo
Just me and all of my cousins know
Blue eyes, we are the sensitive ones
Tell me this isn't happening
Do do do do do do do do do

In tree forts I'll see you
True wild one, where are you tonight?
Where are you tonight?
Where's your home tonight?
How can this be life?

And I can feel the sun on you
Warm me up the way you do
After all the clouds have dried
Here's a jar of tears I've cried
Oh keep it in a sacred place
Hold me in your humble grace
'Cause I can feel the darkness sometimes too
But I can feel the sun on you
