And it hit me like a lightning bolt
I know, I know the feeling
When I'm just about to lose control
I know, I know the feeling

I don't wanna be another one of your loves
I don't wanna be another one of your loves
'Cause you never wanna get too close
Right now I'm on your lips

But you are always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You are always on my mind
Like every day and night
You're always on my mind (always on my mind)

Scared of thunder when I hear it calling
I know, I know the danger
You're looking at me like the sky is falling
I know, I know the danger

I don't wanna be another one of your loves
I don't wanna be another one of your loves
Got me feeling like a lightning bolt
Right now I'm on your lips

But you are always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You are always on my mind
Like every day and night
You're always on my mind (always on my mind)

You're like a holiday
I hope it lasts a lifetime
And I'm not scared to say
That you are always on my mind

(Always on my mind)
(Always on my mind)

I don't wanna be another one of your loves
I don't wanna be another one of your loves
I don't wanna be another one of your loves
I don't wanna be another one, I want only you

You are always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind (always on my mind)
You are always on my mind
Like every day and night
You're always on my mind (always on my mind)

You're like a holiday
I hope it lasts a lifetime
And I'm not scared to say
That you are always on my mind
I know we'll make it, babe
I hope it lasts a lifetime
And I'm not scared to say
That you are always on my mind
