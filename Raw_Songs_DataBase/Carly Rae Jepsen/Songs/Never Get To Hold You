Oh baby, don't you go
You know I didn't mean it, darling
Sweet, like the morning light
Goes late into the evening
All I want is to hold you
Make you rock away this feeling for me
Oh baby, don't you go
You know I didn't mean it

Until I saw you in my thunderstorm, I didn't see you
I wanna be the one that's in your arms
I wanna feel you

I never get to hold you as long as I want to
Remember, I told you you're all that I need
You're all that I need
I never get to hold you as long as I want to
Remember, I told you you're all that I need
You're all that I need, babe

Oh, sugar, sugar, spice and all things nice
I'll be there for you
Just say you'll stay the night
I need you 'til the morning light
'Cause, oh darling, don't you know
My only heart is beating for you
Oh baby, don't you go
You know I didn't mean it

Until I saw you in my thunderstorm, I didn't see you
I wanna be the one that's in your arms
I wanna feel you (I wanna feel you)

I never get to hold you as long as I want to
Remember, I told you you're all that I need
You're all that I need
I never get to hold you as long as I want to
Remember, I told you you're all that I need
You're all that I need, babe

But I don't think that anybody understands you the way I do, the way I do
I know you'll let it go to your head if I say I'll stay
I don't think that anybody understands you the way I do, the way I do
I know you'll let it go to your head if I say I'll stay

I never get to hold you as long as I want to
Remember, I told you you're all that I need
You're all that I need
I never get to hold you as long as I want to
Remember, I told you you're all that I need
You're all that I need, baby
