I could take a picture
Of you and me together
No one would believe me
No one would believe me

Say it in a whisper
That baby it don't get much better
Would I like to see you again?

You name the day
And I will pick the city
We'll fly away
'Til then, call me when you miss me
If you're asking if I'd really like to see you again
I say, oh just say when

Tell me that you feel it
This you and me together
No one would believe me
Even I cannot believe it

You kiss me like you mean it
Oh baby, it don't get much better
Would I like to see you again?

Darling just say when

You name the day
And I will pick the city
We'll fly away
'Til then, call me when you miss me
If you're asking if I'd really like to see you again
I say oh...just say when

Two different worlds
I thought they'd keep us apart
I'm ignoring my head
Follow my heart

Oh you pick the day, darling
And I will pick the city
We'll fly away
'Til then, call me when you miss me
I am willing to wait
Cause I just gotta see you again
So, don't ask. No. Just say when

You name the day and I will pick the city
(Just say when)
We'll fly away
'Til then, call me when you miss me
If you're asking if I'd really like to see you again
I say oh oh oh

I could take a picture
Of you and me together
No one would believe me
No one would believe me
