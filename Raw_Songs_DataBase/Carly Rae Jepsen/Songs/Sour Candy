Sour candy endings
Coffee stained but aware
Oh, I'm so tangled up in my big sunglasses
And bed hungry, second-day fare

No, we went under
The weight was too much to carry and
I felt the thunder
Mister, don't look so scared
I never knew, I never knew that I could be so sad
We went under

And I've been very cautious
Trying numbness instead of pain
All your humor makes me, makes me nauseous
What a twisted, twisted, twisted game

No, we went under
The weight was too much to carry and
I felt the thunder
Mister, don't look so scared
I never knew, I never knew that I could be so sad
We went under

Oh, get yourself home
You leave him alone
On second thought, I regret the pink stiletto
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Sour candy endings
And I was barely even there

No, we went under
The weight was too much to carry and
I felt the thunder
Mister, don't look so scared
I never knew, I never knew that I could be so sad (we went under)
So sad (we went under)
So sad (we went under)
So sad (we went under)
So sad we went under
