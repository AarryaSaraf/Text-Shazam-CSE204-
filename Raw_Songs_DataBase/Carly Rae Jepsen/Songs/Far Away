I'd give this love a second try
First I just imagined all your qualities and that's my fault
But if you could put my feet back on the ground
We could try to introduce ourselves
I'd like to get to know you

Let me kiss all of these tears coming down
I heard a night bird singing
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Your face is calming me down
Maybe I'll just stop thinking
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Just tell me you need me side by side
The sweetest words of my whole life
Oh baby not far away not far away from that conversation

Just tell me you need me side by side
The sweetest words of my whole life
Oh baby not far away not far away from that conversation

Trying not to talk first
'Cause words don't mean authority
And you look powerful just standing tall in front of me
But if you could put my feet back on the ground
We could try to introduce ourselves
I'd like to get to know you

Let me kiss all of these tears coming down
I heard a night bird singing

The sweetest words of my whole life
Oh baby not far away not far away from that conversation

Just tell me you need me side by side
The sweetest words of my whole life
Oh baby not far away not far away from that conversation

A night bird singing

Just tell me you need me side by side
The sweetest words of my whole life
Oh baby not far away not far away from that conversation

Just tell me you need me side by side
The sweetest words of my whole life
Oh baby not far away not far away from that conversation
