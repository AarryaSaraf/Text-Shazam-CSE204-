Call out your persuasions
I got the feeling that you don't know what to say, it's a
A black-dress occasion
Nobody's dying, it's a dinner, not a date, but I
Feel young and inspired
That this is over and I'm hoping you'll agree, so I
Phase out and smile over
That little phrase, "It isn't you, baby, it's me"

So take the tarot card
And tell a fortune gold
The past heartbreaks, the lies we told, we tell again

Let's be friends, then never speak again (Ooh)
It's cool (Cool), we can just pretend
We're friends and never speak again (Never speak again)
See you soon, hope we can remain good friends

You take it, the bottle down
Man, this is easier than how I thought it'd go
You're smiling like a devil
You tell me you were coming here to let me know that
It's over when it's over
And it's over, baby

So take the tarot card (Take the tarot card)
And tell a fortune gold
The past heartbreaks, the lies we told, we tell again

Let's be friends, then never speak again (Ooh)
It's cool (Cool), we can just pretend
We're friends and never speak again (Never speak again)
See you soon, hope we can remain good friends

Catch you later
Never gonna see you again
See you never
Let's be friends
Catch you later
Never gonna see you again
See you never

I had a really nice time with you
I mean, you're sort of a dick sometimes 
But someone out there is surely gonna love a dick
Uh, check, please

Let's be friends, then never speak again (Ooh)
It's cool (Cool), we can just pretend
We're friends and never speak again (Never speak again)
See you soon, hope we can remain good friends

Catch you later
Never gonna see you again
See you never
Let's be friends
Catch you later
Never gonna see you again
See you never
Let's be friends

Let's be friends
Let's be friends
Not really though
