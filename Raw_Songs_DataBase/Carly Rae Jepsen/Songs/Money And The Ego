Make my house of bricks
And I'll stick here when the world
Comes crashing down around me
Make your arms a willow tree
And you can bend with me
Anywhere that I am going

Sometimes it's hard to see anything lovely
All the people around me going for
Money, and the money, and the egos
How can you ask me "Why?"?
I need to know before I try
I've got to be sure there's more than
Money, and the money, and the egos

Keep your eyes on me
And I'll look to you so I can see
What I am here for
Pull the wool over my eyes
Please kiss this day goodbye
Only you can get me going

Sometimes it's hard to see anything lovely
All the people around me going for
Money, and the money, and the egos
How can you ask me "Why?"?
I need to know before I try
I've got to be sure there's more than
Money, and the money, and the egos

Giving up is all you've got
And giving up is all you want
You hear yourself say you've lost the will, the power
Giving up is all you've got
And giving up is all you want
But don't be afraid to sit down in your shower
Stay in there for hours

Make my house of bricks
And I'll stick here when the world
Comes crashing down around me

Sometimes it's hard to see anything lovely
All the people around me going for
Money, and the money, and the egos
How can you ask me "Why?"?
I need to know before I try
I've got to be sure there's more than
Money, and the money, and the egos

(Got to be sure there's more)
Money, and the money and the egos
(Got to be sure there's more)
Money, and the money and the egos
