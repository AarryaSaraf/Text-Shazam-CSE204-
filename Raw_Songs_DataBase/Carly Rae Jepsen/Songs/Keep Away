Hands touch all night, I remember
I stayed behind and you were tender
In my whole life, I wish I never knew this kind of love

I'm keepin' company
Company with all the friends I got from you
It's not easy to sever
Think you're onto me
Hard to keep it cool, I know you want me too

I, I'm tryin' to keep away from you
Gonna need some land between our bodies though
I'm tryin' to keep away from you
I can't control the things I do
God, I miss your hands over my body though
I'm tryin' to keep away from you

Wake up this time, it's now or never
You've made your mind up and I surrender
My heart was blind, I wish I never knew this kind of love

I'm keepin' company
Company with all the friends I got from you
It's not easy to sever
Think you're onto me
Hard to keep it cool, I know you want me too
It takes all of my pride

I, I'm tryin' to keep away from you
We're gonna need some land between our bodies though
I'm tryin' to keep away from you
I can't control the things I do
God, I miss your hands over my body though
I'm tryin' to keep away from you

(Keep away, away, keep away, away)
(Keep away, away, keep away, away)
Keep away, away, keep away, away
Keep away, away, keep away, away
Keep away, away, keep away, away (Been tryin' to keep away from you)
Keep away, away, keep away, away
Keep away, away, keep away, away (Been tryin' keep away from you)
Keep away, away, keep away, away
Just one word from you and I'm all out of reasons
(Keep away, away, keep away, away)
Wakin' up, makin' up for the lost time
(Keep away, away, keep away, away)
Just one word from you and I'm all out of reasons
(Keep away, away, keep away, away)
Close the door, I've been yours for the longest time
(Keep away, away, keep away, away)

Keep away, away, keep away, away
God, I miss your hands over my body
Keep away, away, keep away, away
Keep away, away, keep away, away
God, I miss your hands over my body
Keep away, away, keep away, away
