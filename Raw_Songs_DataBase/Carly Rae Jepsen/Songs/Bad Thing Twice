I don't remember
I don't remember you
I try not to go there
I need a spotless mind

I was born in November
You were born in a different moon
The push and the pull there
What do you want this time

Cross the rivers of my mind
You're my little rock skipper
Skipper, skipper, skipper

Every time I close my eyes
You're my little heart hiccup
Give it up give it up
Yeah

Is it my
Is it my destiny?
I wanna do a bad thing twice

A critical
Critical test to me
I wanna do a bad thing twice

Can't stop feeling the rain before the thunder
I thought it through and
I wanna do a bad thing twice

Is it my
Is it my destiny?
I wanna do a bad thing twice

You were the king and I was a soldier babe
I fought for your attention
Fought for you lonely eyes

I had a vision I had to run away
Let's play this thing over
I wanna go back in time

Cross the rivers of my mind
You're my little rock skipper
Skipper, skipper, skipper

Every time I close my eyes
You're my little heart hiccup
Give it up
Give it up
Yeah

Is it my
Is it my destiny?
I wanna do a bad thing twice

A critical
Critical test to me
I wanna do a bad thing twice

Can't stop feeling the rain before the thunder
I thought it through and
I wanna do a bad thing twice

Is it my
Is it my destiny?
I wanna do a bad thing twice

Caught that fever
I shouldn't be here
Only got me to blame

Caught that fever
I shouldn't be here
Only got me to blame

Caught that fever
I shouldn't be here
Only got me to blame
