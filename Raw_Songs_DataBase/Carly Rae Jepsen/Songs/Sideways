Smudged red lipstick on you
I'm so satisfied
We spilled that coffee cup
On my couch a thousand times

Oh now I smile at strangers
I'm that annoying type
Who don't care if there's traffic
Cause I've got plans tonight

Later we'll meet at your place
Later we'll be together ah ah
Ever since you said that you were mine

Everything's going my way
And I like to get my way
Even when things go sideways
Raining on my parade
I get all my confidence from you
I get all my confidence from you
Mmmm

One more cute disaster
Said, "I love you twice"
Before you could even answer
It's hard here in paradise

I'm living to look at your face
Living it up together
Ever since you said that you were mine

Everything's going my way
And I like to get my way
Even when things go sideways
Raining on my parade
I get all my confidence from you
I get all my confidence from you
Mmm

Ever since you said la da da da da
