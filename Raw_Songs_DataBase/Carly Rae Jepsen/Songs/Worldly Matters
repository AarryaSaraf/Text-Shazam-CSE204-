Hot pink skies
Twilight of the day
I think that I've been going 'bout this the wrong way
Kids on my street got it right, man
Barefoot hide and seek
My best friend, she lives up the road
Haven't talked to her in weeks

Oh, time don't blind me, I am so sorry
I've been swept up in my own concerns
And the worldly matters
They just don't matter at all
No, not at all

I keep on walking
I stop ditching all my plans
I want to climb that cedar tree
And leave me in good hands
What happened to me
On the way to something higher?
What will be left when I have all that I desire?

Oh, time don't blind me, I am so sorry
I've been swept up in my own concerns
And the worldly matters
They just don't matter at all
No, not at all
No, not at all

(Time got from me, I'm so sorry)
(I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry)
(Just don't cry, just don't cry)
(Just don't cry, just don't cry)
(Time got from me, I'm so sorry)
(I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry)
(Just don't cry, just don't cry)
(Just don't cry, just don't cry)
(Just don't cry, just don't cry)
(Just don't cry, just don't cry)
(Just don't cry, just don't cry)
(Just don't cry, just don't cry)
