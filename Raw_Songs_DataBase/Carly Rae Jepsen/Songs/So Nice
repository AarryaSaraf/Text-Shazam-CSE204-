So nice
How refreshing you crush all the competition
You can ask me if I'm busy tonight
I could be free for you and me
And maybe we can go for a drive

So light
Keep it easy 'cause I'm kinda independent
But I really need to stay on your mind
No other guy can help me fly
And hold me down at the same time

So nice
Incredibly honest
Polite
So nice all night
He's right to me
It's turning me on that
He's the kind of superstar that would only steal your heart
He's so nice

La, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la-la (La, la, la, la-la)
La, la, la, la-la (All of the reasons I know)
La, la, la, la-la

I'm back in the middle of what could be complicated
But it's different yeah it's easy this time
Communicate, don't make me wait
And say whatever comes to your mind (I love you)

So nice
Incredibly honest
Polite
So nice all night
He's right to me
It's turning me on that
He's the kind of superstar that would only steal your heart
He's so nice

La, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la-la (La, la, la, la-la)
La, la, la, la-la (Give me all of the reasons I know)
(All of your reasons)
(So niggai-i-i-i-)

He's my cup of tea
Sugar on my street
Hope he never leaves
I hope he never leaves me
'Cause he's all of the reasons I know
Give me all of the reasons

Apple of my eye
He took me by surprise
He swept me off my feet
I hope he never leaves me
'Cause he's all of the reasons I know
Give me all of the reasons
