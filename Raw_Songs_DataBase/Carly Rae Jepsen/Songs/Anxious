I need love to keep me satisfied
But you know, but you know
I want more than what they advertise
And you're so rational

But you didn't even notice (even notice)
I was hoping you would open up (I was hoping)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Boy, you got a reputation

I get anxious
'Cause I need a little headroom
So damn, baby
Moving over to the bedroom
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Boy you got a reputation
I get anxious
Moving over to the bedroom

I should cool it off, I know you're tired
But you know (you know), but you know (you know)
But I never take my own advice
And you're so rational

But you didn't even notice
I was jealous of your company
Boy, you got a reputation
(Mmh, mmh)

I get anxious
'Cause I need a little headroom (I need a little headroom)
So damn (so damn), baby
Moving over to the bedroom
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Boy you got a reputation
(Mmh, mmh)
I get anxious
Moving over to the bedroom
(Mmh, mmh)

Ooh, ooh
Boy, you got a reputation
