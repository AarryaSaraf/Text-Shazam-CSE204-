I survive on hotel shampoos
I'll be runnin' out soon
You've gone away again
Gone to collect some more
Your hands pressed hard into me
I thought summer you'd be gone away again
Ooh, he's gone away again

We were poor
Yeah, we were dream chasers, baby
Skyscrapers are not too tall
He's gonna prove me right 'til I'm wrong

I'm craving all the gold and the riches
I don't want to wash my own dishes
He's gone away again, hmm, he's gone away again
I'm driving in a sweet brand new car
I'm living the life of a superstar
I got my way again, hmm, I got my way again

We were poor
Yeah, we were dream chasers, baby
Skyscrapers are not too tall
He's gonna prove me right 'til I'm wrong

He says that he don't recognize us
In all our pretty disguises
In all out pretty disguises
Work hard, oh, we work until we're sleepin'
And we sleep, but we're not dreaming
Oh, we sleep, but we're not dreaming
(Where's his love)
Where's his love? Where's his kisses?
He says, "Sorry babe, this has got away from me"
He's gone away from me

We were poor
Yeah, we were dream chasers, baby
Skyscrapers are not too tall
He's gonna prove me right
I know he'll prove me right
He's gonna prove me right 'til I'm wrong
