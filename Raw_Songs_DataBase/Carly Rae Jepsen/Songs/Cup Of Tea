A cup of tea, a cup of tea
I've been driving all night, you won't turn on your light that easily
A neon sign offers some shelter across the street
Guess I'll drink my trouble down with a cup of tea

You're over me, you're over me
I howl at your room like a wolf to the moon, going crazy
Ring one more time, it won't bring your footsteps down to me
Guess I'll sit and wait all night with my cup of tea

But it's getting cold in here, 24 hours dear
Are you with someone else tonight?
Distance was killing me, I thought how surprised you'd be
I hope we make sweet love after we fight

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

I let it be, try to let it be
I'll be hot to your touch, you say I think too much, call me 'baby'
And it'll all be fine once you are walking up the street
'Til then I'll sit and wait all night with my cup of tea

But darling, it's getting cold in here, yeah, 24 hours dear
Are you with someone else tonight?
Distance was killing me, I thought how surprised you'd be
I hope we make sweet love after we fight

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

A cup of tea, a cup of tea
She's holding your waist like she'd give you a taste so easily
I won't cry, no, I'll just watch, and I will see
And I'll say my last goodbye with a cup of tea
