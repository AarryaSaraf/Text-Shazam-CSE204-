Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since with no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Oh, it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought some corn for popping
Since the lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear is still goodbye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
