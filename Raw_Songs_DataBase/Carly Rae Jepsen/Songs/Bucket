(There is a hole in your bucket)

Sun's out we got a beach day
Forget yourself say why don't we people watch?
Kids are playin' 'round in the sand

(Little boy crying)
Oh no, he's got some troubles
Got us laughing as he throws his shovel
Nothing's really going as planned

I don't know how we're going to build a castle now
Do you wanna start again somehow?
I'll stay until the sun comes down, down, down

(Are you smiling?)
Look over my shoulder
See your laughter bubble over
Lately you've been working too hard

And I've been waiting to recognize
That sparkle that's in your eye
Those two dimples on your cheeks
The joy that lights the fire

I don't know how we're going to build a castle now
Do you wanna start again somehow?
I'll stay until the sun comes down, down, down

There's a hole in my bucket
Dear Liza, Dear Liza
There's a hole in my bucket
Dear Liza, a hole

And I don't know how we're supposed to build a castle now
Do you wanna start again somehow?
I'll stay until the sun comes down, down, down
I'll stay until the sun comes

I don't know how we're gonna build a castle now
Do you wanna start again somehow?
I'll stay until the sun comes down, down, down
'Til the sun comes down

(Sun's down, here come the waves, and there goes the castle)
Sun's coming down, I'll stay
(Sun's down, here come the waves, and there goes the castle)
Sun's coming down, I'll stay
(Sun's down, here come the waves, and there goes the castle)
Sun's coming down, I'll stay
(Sun's down, here come the waves, and there goes the castle)
