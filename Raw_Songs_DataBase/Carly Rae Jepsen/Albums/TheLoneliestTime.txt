// Surrender My Heart //

So I've been trying hard to open up
When I lost someone it hit me rough
I paid to toughen up in therapy
She said to me, 'soften up'

I'm sorry if I push your good away
Especially when I'm needing you to stay
I know you hate that I still test your love
I'm trying not to fuck this up

But the benefit of all the broken hearts
That I broke before they could break me
Is a little bit of life regrets
I won't bring that mess to you when you're with me
And I wanna be brave enough to show you my not-so-perfect family
And I wanna be brave enough for everything

Surrender my heart
(I'm out here in the open)
I wanna get closer
(I believe in you every night)
Surrender my heart
I wanna be open
I wanna be honest with you

I used to soldier through my hardest days
I used to switch it off, ignore the pain
I craved to feel it all entirely in your arms, baby

But the benefit of all the broken hearts
That I broke before they could break me
Is a little bit of life regrets
I won't bring that mess to you when you're with me
And I wanna be brave enough to show you my not-so-perfect family
And I wanna be brave enough for everything

Surrender my heart
(I'm out here in the open)
I wanna get closer
(I believe in you every night)
Surrender my heart
I wanna be open
I wanna be honest with you

I believe in you every night
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Every night
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Every night
(I believe in you every night)
I believe in you every night
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Every night
(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
Every night
(I believe in you every night)

Surrender my heart
(I'm out here in the open)
I wanna get closer
(I believe in you every night)
Surrender my heart
I wanna be open
I wanna be honest with you

// Joshua Tree //

Running from the night
I drove miles away to finally feel alone
There's no moon in sight
But the desert lights could lead the way back home

I'm in the moment
Living undercover
Painting on each other
All the colors
I can't get enough

California dreaming's
Never what it seems but
Here it comes
I know what I must do now

I need it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I feel it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I see it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I know it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I own it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I show it (da, da, da, da, da, da)

Give me paradise
I'll eclipse the stars and fall like once before
I'm like Aphrodite
And it's fine to only know the things I know

I'm in the moment
Living undercover
Painting on each other
All the colors
I can't get enough

California dreaming's
Never what it seems but
Here it comes
I know what I must do now

I need it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I feel it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I see it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I know it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I own it (da, da, da, da, da, da)
I show it (da, da, da, da, da, da)

I'm feeling dramatic
I like the moon and the magic
Of this
Oh, I, Oh, I, Oh

I'm feeling dramatic
I like the moon and the magic
Of this
Oh, I, Oh, I, Oh
