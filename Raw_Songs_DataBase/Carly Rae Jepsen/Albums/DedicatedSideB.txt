// This Love Isn't Crazy //

Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

For some time, I've been
Waiting for your star to shine so bright
I should say that it's your right to hurt me, baby
If you wanted to, oh, but love isn't cruel
And for some time, I've been
Singing you a lullaby each night
Whispering that it's your right to hurt me, baby
If you wanted to, oh, but love isn't cruel

That's why we got to hold on, baby
We could believe that this love isn't crazy
This loving could save me
This love isn't crazy (This love, it isn't crazy)
You gotta stand where (Stand where) I stand
Who could believe that you're holding my hand now?
This loving could save me
This love isn't crazy (This love isn't crazy)

Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

For some time, I've been
Pillow-talking in my head, my heart's vulnerable
But in my bed, I want you, baby
And all you put me through, oh, but love isn't cruel
Another night I swear I saw you in my dream, dream
We didn't say too much, but I understood everything
That you could hurt me, baby, and I could hurt you too
Oh, but love isn't cruel (Hold on, hold on)

That's why we got to hold on, baby
We could believe that this love isn't crazy
This loving could save me
This love isn't crazy (This love, it isn't crazy)
You gotta stand where (Stand where) I stand
Gimme the seasons, I'm holding your hand now
This loving could save me
This love isn't crazy (This love, it isn't crazy)

(I know it) And I want you bad
(I feel it) And I feel it bad
(I know it and I feel it and) Every day, want you more
We were so insecure
(This love, it isn't crazy) Every day, learning more
We were so immature
(I know it) I want you bad
(I feel it) And I feel it bad
(I know it and I feel it and) Every day, want you more
We were so insecure
(This love, it isn't crazy) Every day, learning more
We were so immature (Hold on, hold on)

That's why we got to hold on, baby (I know it)
I can believe that this love isn't crazy (I feel it)
This loving could save me (I know it and I feel it and)
This love isn't crazy (This love, it isn't crazy, hold on, hold on)
You gotta stand where (Stand where) I stand (I know it)
I can believe that you're holding my hand now (I feel it)
This loving could save me (I know it and I feel it and)
This love isn't crazy (This love, it isn't crazy)

Ooh

// Window //

Baby, I could praise you
Try to turn your head around
Could you take a compliment? Oh, oh, oh
Everything I say, you
I find a way to drown it out
Make it like an argument

I see you a different way
So take my eyes to borrow

Keep a window for me open
Open for me always
Please don't lock the door
Ooh, I'll be your special somebody
Hands over your body
Keep you wantin' more

I know you're not sleepin'
Thinkin' that the sky could fall
You never let the dreams get in, oh, oh, oh
The secrets that you're keepin'
Well, I want you to share them all
'Cause, baby, I can handle it

Just hold my hand a different way
And take my eyes to borrow

Keep a window for me open
Open for me always
Please don't lock the door
Ooh, I'll be your special somebody
Not just anybody
Keep you wantin' more

You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I'm needin' ya
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I need your love
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I'm needin' ya
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one

Keep a window for me open
Open for me always
Please don't lock the door
Ooh, I'll be your special somebody
God, I love your body
Keep me wantin' more
Keep a window for me open
Open for me always
Please don't lock the door
Ooh, I'll be your special somebody
Hands over your body
Keep me wantin' more

You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I'm needin' ya
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I need your love
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I'm needin' ya
You were the one, you were the one, you were the one
And I need your love

// Felt This Way //

I tried your mouth and I can't come back
So little time and I'm way off track
I can't stay away
(Away away away away)
I can't stay away
(Away away away away)

The city's so hard when you sleep alone
I need your hands when you drive me home
I can't stay away
(Away away away away)
I can't stay away
(Away away away away)

But I can't take much more of your hesitating
Both our hands speak for us and complicate it
My home is your body
How can I stay away?

And if my love's too strong for you, walk away
But I can't make this wrong when I see your face
My home is your body
How can I stay away?

Oh, if it was only an attraction
How come nobody ever felt this way?
If it was only a distraction
How come I can't stay away?

Oh, you were a party to the action
I think nobody ever felt this way
If it was only a distraction
How come I can't stay away?

Wherever I go I still see your face
So little time there's no time to waste
I can't stay away
(Away away away away)
I can't stay away
(Away away away away)

Reading your mind's getting hard to do
Breaking my heart if you don't come through
I can't stay away
(Away away away away)
I can't stay away
(Away away away away)

But, I can't take much more of your hesitating
Both our hands speak for us and complicate it
My home is your body
How can I stay away?

And if my love's too strong for you, walk away
But I can't make this wrong when I see your face
My home is your body
How can I stay away?

Oh, if it was only an attraction
How come nobody ever felt this way?
If it was only a distraction
How come I can't stay away?

Oh, you were a party to the action
I think nobody ever felt this way
If it was only a distraction
How come I can't stay away?

Those sweet summer lies
Your night after night
Come closer I'll hold you
I need you now, now

It's still on my mind
Yeah time after time
Come closer, come closer

Oh, if it was only an attraction
How come nobody ever felt this way?
If it was only a distraction
How come I can't stay away?

Oh, you were a party to the action
I think nobody ever felt this way
If it was only a distraction
How come I can't stay away?

// Stay Away //

How can I stay away?

I tried your mouth and I can't come back
So little time and I'm way off track
I can't stay away, away, away, away for one night

Hey, wherever I go I still see your face
So little time, there's no time to waste
I can't stay away, away, away, away for one night

Hey, I don't know where your head is now
I've been only thinkin 'bout us
(Thinkin 'bout us)

Don't know what your hands are doin'
I've been only thinkin 'bout touch
Touch, touch, touch me

I can't take much more of your hesitating
Both our hands speak for us and complicate it
My home is your body
How can I stay away?
(Away, away, away, away)

If my love's too strong for you, walk away
But I can't make this wrong when I see your face
My home is your body
How can I stay away?
(Away, away, away, away)

The city's so hard when you sleep alone
I need your hands when you drive me home
I can't stay away, away, away, away for one night

Hey, I don't know where your head is now
I've been only thinkin 'bout us
(Thinkin 'bout us)

Don't know what your hands are doin'
I've been only thinkin 'bout touch
Touch, touch, touch me

I can't take much more of your hesitating
Both our hands speak for us and complicate it
My home is your body
How can I stay away?
(Away, away, away, away)

If my love's too strong for you, walk away
But I can't make this wrong when I see your face
My home is your body
How can I stay away?
(Away, away, away, away)

How can I stay away?
How can I stay away?

Don't know where your head is now
I've been only thinkin 'bout us

Don't know what your hands are doin'
I've been only thinkin 'bout touch
Touch, touch, touch me

I can't take much more of your hesitating
Both our hands speak for us and complicate it
My home is your body
How can I stay away?
(Away, away, away, away)

If my love's too strong for you, walk away
But I can't make this wrong when I see your face

(Away, away, away, away)

How can I stay away?

// Heartbeat //

Thinking that I need you to go now
'Cause this could really get out of hand (Oh, wow)
I'm hiding things I don't wanna show now (Oh, wow)
'Cause I don't know if you're ready for that

I was busy sleeping, sleeping with you
I thought I'd never feel this way, but I do

And I don't wanna tell you
Anything about me
'Cause everything about you
Is speeding up my heartbeat
And I don't wanna tell you
You're better off without me, ah, ah
'Cause everything about you
Is speeding up my, speeding up my
Speeding up my, speeding up my
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Heartbeat, heart

Everything's a little bit clearer
How my body feels in your hands
It makes me want to get a little bit nearer
Yeah, but I don't know if you're ready for that

I was busy sleeping, sleeping with you
I thought I'd never feel this way, but I do

And I don't wanna tell you (I don't wanna tell you)
Anything about me (Anything about me)
'Cause everything about you ('Cause everything about you)
Is speeding up my heartbeat
And I don't wanna tell you (I don't wanna tell you)
You're better off without me, ah, ah
'Cause everything about you ('Cause everything about you)
Is speeding up my, speeding up my
Speeding up my, speeding up my
Heartbeat, heartbeat
Heartbeat, heart

I don't know if you should hear this
'Cause it's a mess inside my head
Maybe you should go instead (You should go)
I'm suddenly scared of my feelings
This might be all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted to happen to me
To me, to me
You've been like a light
Like a light

And I don't wanna tell you (I don't wanna tell you)
Anything about me (Anything about me)
'Cause everything about you ('Cause everything about you)
Is speeding up my heartbeat
And I don't wanna tell you (I don't wanna tell you)
You're better off without me, ah, ah
'Cause everything about you
Is speeding up my, speeding up my
Speeding up my, speeding up my
Heartbeat (Heartbeat), heartbeat (Speeding)
Heartbeat, heart

'Cause I live for the feeling
Dance to the feeling

// Fake Mona Lisa //

He's born in Vegas among the stars
And on his cheek beauty mark
Barely noticed it from the start
A constellation to stir my heart

Every night I'm wearing my black in case you're comin' 'round
Fifty-seven days and it still feels like I'm not comin' down

The night we painted over your fake Mona Lisa
Lipstick on the corners, said her smile was teasin' ya
Oh, you took my clothes off, said, "It's gettin' hotter."
Don't know how to swim, but let's breathe underwater

I was born a dreamer
And I'm still that way
Live for tomorrow or yesterday

Every night I'm wearing my black in case you're comin' 'round
Fifty-seven days and it still feels like I'm not comin' down

The night we painted over your fake Mona Lisa
Lipstick on the corners, said her smile was teasin' ya
Oh, you took my clothes off, said, "It's gettin' hotter."
Don't know how to swim, but let's breathe underwater

// Let's Sort The Whole Thing Out //

What it feels like when I'm next to you
It's a soft touch that I read into
Was it just me, did you linger for too long?
But it's alright if it's on your mind
'Cause it's all I'm thinkin' all the time
There was one thing that I wanted all my life
For real

Somebody wants you, somebody cares (For real)
Somebody wants you, somebody cares (Then he said)

I love you, this is a new thing
One more drink, let's get to the bottom of it
I love you, let's sort the whole thing out (Then he said)
I love you, this is a new thing
One more drink, let's get to the bottom of it
I love you, let's sort the whole thing out
Let's sort the whole thing out

Let's sort the whole thing out

I was broken in a million ways
Then I met you and I saw your face
I was certain I could not want something more
Goin' crazy 'cause you're hard to read
But I know you want this bad as me
It's a good thing and I want you to be sure
For real

Somebody wants you, somebody cares (For real)
Somebody wants you, somebody cares (Then he said)

I love you, this is a new thing
One more drink, let's get to the bottom of it
I love you, let's sort the whole thing out (Then he said)
I love you, this is a new thing
One more drink, let's get to the bottom of it
I love you, let's sort the whole thing out
Let's sort the whole thing out

Let's sort the whole thing out

I love you
I love you

Never thought I'd hear you say
I've been hopin' every day
Never thought I'd hear you say
I've been hopin' every day (Then he said)

I love you, this is a new thing
One more drink, let's get to the bottom of it
I love you, let's sort the whole thing out (Then he said)
I love you, this is a new thing
One more drink, let's get to the bottom of it
I love you, let's sort the whole thing out
Let's sort the whole thing out

Let's sort the whole thing out
I love you

// Comeback //

I'm at a war with myself
We go back to my place
Take my makeup off
Show you my best disguise
You believe in my heart
You believe in my kind
It's a tragedy boy
Every time you ask me

I don't know what I'm feelin', but I believe
I was thinkin' 'bout makin' a comeback
Back to me
And I won't say you're the reason I was on my knees
But I'm thinkin' 'bout makin' a comeback
Back to me

I'm at peace in the dark
When I know that you're near
Hear the breath of your heart
Singing me a lullaby
All those travelin' years
'Til we said our goodbye
And I show up to your place
You don't even ask me why

I don't know what I'm feelin', but I believe
I was thinkin' 'bout makin' a comeback
Back to me
And I won't say you're the reason I was on my knees
But I'm thinkin' 'bout makin' a comeback
Back to me

And if you wanna know why I have no regrets
Sometimes you've gotta dig low to get 'round to it
And there is nothing I'm so sure of
Nothing I'm so sure of
If you wanna know why I have no regrets

Well, then you'll come with me, I'm the keeper of that beat
And the fire under your feet
I'm the keeper man
I am the keeper
Come baby, dance the night down on your knees
Dance your heart down onto your sleeve
I'm the keeper man
And I am the keeper

And I am the keeper

I don't know what I'm feelin', but I believe
I was thinkin' 'bout makin' a comeback
Back to me

I don't know what I'm feelin', but I believe
I was thinkin' that maybe you'll come back
Back to me
And I won't say you're the reason I was on my knees
But I'm thinkin' that maybe you'll come back
Come back to me

Come with me, I'm the keeper of that beat
And the fire under your feet
I'm the keeper man
I am the keeper
Come baby, dance the night down on your knees
Dance your heart down onto your sleeve
I'm the keeper man
I am the keeper

// Solo //

And I know what it feels like
To be alone on a cold night
No one you can hold tight (Hold tight, ah, ah, ah)
And I'm not trying to play it down
But it's all gonna turn around
And I swear it'll be alright (Alright, ah, ah, ah)

You let go, she moved on
A thousand stories before
You felt it, then lost it
You're lonely, your heart aches
But get yourself off the floor
I can't stand to see you crying

So what you're not in love?
Don't go wasting your nights getting so low
So what you're not in love?
You shine bright by yourself dancing solo

It looks nice from the outside
When they all got the perfect guy
Hold on for the long ride (Long ride, ah, ah, ah)
But your fears got it all wrong
That he's right and there's something wrong
'Cause I swear, you'll be alright (Alright, ah, ah, ah)

You let go, she moved on
A thousand stories before
You felt it, then lost it
You're lonely, your heart aches
But get yourself off the floor
I can't stand to see you crying

So what you're not in love?
Don't go wasting your nights getting so low
So what you're not in love?
You shine bright by yourself dancing solo

You let go, she moved on
A thousand stories before
You felt it, then lost it
You're lonely, your heart aches
But get yourself off the floor
I can't stand to see you crying

So what you're not in love?
Don't go wasting your nights getting so low
So what you're not in love?
You shine bright by yourself dancing solo

// Now I Don't Hate California After All //

My lover don't mind if
I follow him 'round
I'm high as a kite when I'm with him
All of the time

He gives me the holiday I needed all the time (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Maybe this is temporary, I don't even mind (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now I don't hate California after all
Now I don't hate California after all

Love on the beach and the tide is high
Ooh, ooh
Moon in the water and the open sky
Ooh, ooh

And now that he noticed
I follow him 'round
He's all kinds of hardness and heartless
But I know he's down

He gives me the holiday I needed all the time (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Maybe this is temporary, I don't even mind (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now I don't hate California after all
Now I don't hate California after all

Love on the beach and the tide is high
Ooh, ooh
Moon in the water and the open sky
Ooh, ooh

I just wanna stay
Another night, another day
We could wash the world away
We could play like children play

Love on the beach and the tide is high
(Love on the beach and the tide is high)
Ooh, ooh
Moon in the water and the open sky
(Moon in the water and the open sky)
Ooh, ooh
Love on the beach and the tide is high
(Love on the beach and the tide is high)
Ooh, ooh
Moon in the water and the open sky
(Moon in the water and the open sky)
Ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh

// Let's Be Friends //

Call out your persuasions
I got the feeling that you don't know what to say, it's a
A black-dress occasion
Nobody's dying, it's a dinner, not a date, but I
Feel young and inspired
That this is over and I'm hoping you'll agree, so I
Phase out and smile over
That little phrase, "It isn't you, baby, it's me"

So take the tarot card
And tell a fortune gold
The past heartbreaks, the lies we told, we tell again

Let's be friends, then never speak again (Ooh)
It's cool (Cool), we can just pretend
We're friends and never speak again (Never speak again)
See you soon, hope we can remain good friends

You take it, the bottle down
Man, this is easier than how I thought it'd go
You're smiling like a devil
You tell me you were coming here to let me know that
It's over when it's over
And it's over, baby

So take the tarot card (Take the tarot card)
And tell a fortune gold
The past heartbreaks, the lies we told, we tell again

Let's be friends, then never speak again (Ooh)
It's cool (Cool), we can just pretend
We're friends and never speak again (Never speak again)
See you soon, hope we can remain good friends

Catch you later
Never gonna see you again
See you never
Let's be friends
Catch you later
Never gonna see you again
See you never

I had a really nice time with you
I mean, you're sort of a dick sometimes 
But someone out there is surely gonna love a dick
Uh, check, please

Let's be friends, then never speak again (Ooh)
It's cool (Cool), we can just pretend
We're friends and never speak again (Never speak again)
See you soon, hope we can remain good friends

Catch you later
Never gonna see you again
See you never
Let's be friends
Catch you later
Never gonna see you again
See you never
Let's be friends

Let's be friends
Let's be friends
Not really though

// Always On My Mind //

And it hit me like a lightning bolt
I know, I know the feeling
When I'm just about to lose control
I know, I know the feeling

I don't wanna be another one of your loves
I don't wanna be another one of your loves
'Cause you never wanna get too close
Right now I'm on your lips

But you are always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You are always on my mind
Like every day and night
You're always on my mind (always on my mind)

Scared of thunder when I hear it calling
I know, I know the danger
You're looking at me like the sky is falling
I know, I know the danger

I don't wanna be another one of your loves
I don't wanna be another one of your loves
Got me feeling like a lightning bolt
Right now I'm on your lips

But you are always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You are always on my mind
Like every day and night
You're always on my mind (always on my mind)

You're like a holiday
I hope it lasts a lifetime
And I'm not scared to say
That you are always on my mind

(Always on my mind)
(Always on my mind)

I don't wanna be another one of your loves
I don't wanna be another one of your loves
I don't wanna be another one of your loves
I don't wanna be another one, I want only you

You are always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind (always on my mind)
You are always on my mind
Like every day and night
You're always on my mind (always on my mind)

You're like a holiday

And I'm not scared to say
That you are always on my mind
I know we'll make it, babe
I hope it lasts a lifetime
And I'm not scared to say
That you are always on my mind
