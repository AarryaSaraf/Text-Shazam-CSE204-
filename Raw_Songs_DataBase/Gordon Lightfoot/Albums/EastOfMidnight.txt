// Stay Loose //

If you've got a heartache
Of the kind that will not pass by
Even if you don't see the end
Of what lies around the bend
Don't stay that way
It's all in a day believe me
Even the best of dreams must end
Even so it grieves me
Stay loose, don't fight it
Let it take you all the way and
If it's wrong, you will right it
Do not waste these hours away

How many times have I told you
These are the tears I've shed
Could it be that I need help
Is it maybe I've come undone
And one thing more
You know it don't come easy
Even the best of friends must part
Even so it grieves me

Stay loose, don't fight it
Let love take a holiday
If it's wrong, you're gonna right it
Do not waste these hours away

Soon the storm will be over
And the clouds will all pass by
To be insane beyond belief
Is sometimes the best relief
And one thing sure
Love never did come easy
Even the best of dreams must end
Even so it grieves me

Stay loose, don't fight it
Let it take you all the way and
If it's wrong, you will right it
Do not waste these hours away

Stay loose, don't fight it
Let love take a holiday
If it's wrong, you're gonna right it
Do not waste these hours away

// Morning Glory //

Pretty faces everywhere
A few hard cases stop and stare
They've got charm that is not right
Pretty faces late at night
Morning Glory what's the story
Will it ever end
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay
And all the way back again
All the way back again 
I remember our old rendezvous
The key was kept inside a shoe
Those moments will remain frozen in time
Morning Glory's on my mind
What's the story Morning Glory
Will it ever end
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay
And all the way back again
All the way back again 

It seems like only yesterday
She married me and carried me away
I found out what life was all about
Morning Glory threw me out
Hey Morning Glory what's the story
Will it ever end
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay
And all the way back again
Alimony, Palimony
Puts a dent in me
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay
For a dip in the shining sea
A dip in the shining sea 

Pretty faces everywhere
A few hard cases stop and stare
Even when I know it ain't my day
A lot of good faces anyway
Morning Glory what's the story
What is it to be
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay
For a dip in the shining sea
A dip in the shining sea 

What's the story Morning Glory
Will it ever end
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay
And all the way back again
All the way back again
Hey Morning Glory what's the story
Will it ever end
I've been all the way to Biscayne Bay
And all the way back again
All the way back again

// East Of Midnight //

Put me somewhere east of midnight
West of the turnpike
Anywhere I wander is where I'll take my rest
As I lie down, toss some thoughts around
Dreams I'm told will come true if you
Believe in those who love you right now
Sea of dreams I long for you
Forget about the others
This is my hike, you can come if you like
To feel good, I would help you if I could 
But I am out here searching
For the things that might have been
I need no more reminders
Not one love letter have I seen
And that's a pretty good start
The ocean is where lovers meet again
Sea of dreams by all means
Float me out of danger until then
Forever amen 

It's a long long hike
We'll be leavin' early travelin' light
That's alright Heaven will be ours tonight 

The road is paved with moonbeams
There are faces that I knew
They all came back to haunt me
But that ain't fair to the folks like me and you
It takes a bit of my heart
Tonight I shall be watching from the shore
Sea of dreams from now on
Forget about all the others
Back where the line forms
Destination sea of storms
By all means ever onward sea of dreams 

Put me somewhere east of midnight
Along about daylight
Anywhere I wander is where I'll take my rest
If we could just lie down
Toss some thoughts around
It's a tough and a dirty long hike
You can come if you like
If we could just lie down
Toss some thoughts around

// A Lesson In Love //

Nothing is for certain
That's what the showman said
First you must open the curtain
And stand'em on their heads
There can be no inhibitions
No prima donna ways
If you want to pass the audition
And times is tough these days 
Remember when Mr. Barnum
Presented Jenny Lind
They named a candy after her
A circus after him
End of my story
The rest is history
She in all of her glory
He lived quietly
He needed her, she needed him
As sure as the sky above
In a way it was for them
A lesson in love
A lesson in love 

You look like the moonglow
That follows me home
Always makes me turn around
Won't leave me alone
First to come are the midgets
A monkey and a kid
Followed by those two one-armed jugglers
The ego and the id 

Songs of the season
Apples of the sun
There is no rhyme or reason
Just a time for each and every one
Hang on Mr. Barnum
Hang on Jenny Lind
We will meet you in streets of gold
Where eternity begins
We will let it all hangout
Go hand in glove
Life was meant to live and learn
A lesson in love
A lesson in love

// Anything For Love //

In my life
In my time and in each line I've ever sung
And in my life
Was it my imagination or are you still the one
Who lingers on 
I'd do anything for you
You'd do anything for me
We'd do anything for love
Oh you'd use any means
And I would try any scheme for love
We'd do anything for love 

Once or twice
In my loneliness I watched the world go by
There was I
One too many miles beyond where you might say
Some luck was due, after all 

We could have touched the sky
You had no alibi because
We'd do anything for love
Oh I would try any means
To have you in all my dreams because
You'd do anything for love 

Not long ago as I remember
Once upon a dark and windy day
When love looked like a dying ember
Before you came to call
The beauty of it all I though I'd lost and yet 

Cause in my life
Here in my mind in it now shines
A guiding light
Never again will I lose my way
Oh I would not tell a lie and
You had no alibi because
We'd do anything for love
Oh You'd use any means
And I would try any scheme for love
Simply anything for love
Oh I would do anything
Just about anything because
We'd do anything for love
Anything for love

// Let It Ride //

These are just the simple facts
I will relate to you
Though they are not connected
Each and every one is true
If they seem a bit untidy
Well unraveling them is fun
I will not stand corrected
I have not harmed anyone 
I just let it ride
Ride let it ride
Leave on the evenin' tide
Just let it ride 

When I listen to my heart
I sometimes fail to find
One sane and simple answer
On the bright side of my mind
Even when I'm sleeping
I can't seem to unwind
I just let it ride 

I knew a man from Windsor
Who went to Detroit every night
And stateside of the tunnel
Customs agents gave him flight
He threw his stash in the river
And his bedroll on the ground
And when they finally got there
A sleeping man was all that they found 

He just let it ride
Ride let it ride
Leavin' on the evenin' tide
Just let it ride 

Hear the steeple bell ring out
Above my lobster pots
I might be out here fishin' man
But that ain't where it stops
The mouths I feed are many
And they all say thanks a lot
They just let it ride 

One day when I'm old and gray
'N consider what's gone by
I always will be proud of
Every tear I've ever cried
And all of the old jokes we told
Around the candle light
To all those tender damsels
Who had helped us through the night 

They just let it ride
Ride let it ride
Leavin' on the evenin' tide
Just let it ride
I'm gonna let it ride 

Here's to the girls of London
And the ones from Montreal
We never will forget them
We still fantasize them all
I knew one in St. Louis
On a Missouri afternoon
I met one up in Shanghai
And another in Rangoon 

I just let it ride
Ride let it ride
Leavin' on the evenin' tide
Just let it ride
Ride ride ride
I'm gonna let it ride
Leavin' on the evenin' tide
Just let it ride

// Ecstasy Made Easy //

I can always try to forget somehow
What's a part of the past
Have a little laughter if you please
I won't even mind if it takes awhile
I've got time on my hands
I feel another chapter in the breeze 
Somebody touched my heart string
Somebody made my heart sing
Somebody stole my heart away
Nobody's sayin' their sorry
It's a mighty sweet music
You can dance all night
Put some wood on the fire right now
Ecstacy made easy 

Ecstasy I ask you, are you a name
Or just another patron with a smile
Let me analyze you, are you a flame
Or just the dying embers
Of a kiss run wild 

Somebody found my heart string
Somebody made my heart sing
Somebody touched my heart last night
Somebody set me in flight
It's a mighty sweet music
Take a chance they say
Put some fire on the old iron stove
Ecstasy made easy, made easy 

I hope I never lose what belongs to me
By the right of my birth
At midnight sailing out of Perth
Getting under way we turned 'er westward bound
On that southern sea
To sea what ecstasy was worth

// You Just Gotta Be //

If I satisfy you, if you satisfy me
Once the course has been set
Gonna need all the help I can get but
You just gotta be you, 'n I just gotta be me
I can't classify you, you can't pacify me
We can't make it at all
You won't even take my calls
I just want ta be loved
'N you just gotta be free 
I'll smile and tell it to the world
You just gotta be 
Pardon me for sayin'
What a price you've been payin'
What more can I say
You might feel different some day 

If it matter to you, it still matters to me
You'll find me by the bayou
Thinkin' wicked thoughts of you
I just want ta be strong, you just gotta be wrong
I can't clarify you, you can't verify me
I can't make it by stealth
You won't even share the wealth so
You just gotta be you
And I just gotta be me
And I will tell that to the world
You just gotta be 

With a gratified mind, I'll be on the highway
Just as soon as I can
Where there's a will there's a way so until then
I just want ta be me, and you just gotta be

// A Passing Ship //

A passing ship
I have found the open ocean
Give me no lip
The waves roll by as I pass on
A snulit sea
On the first day of April
How fresh the wind
Will you miss me when I'm gone 
How many words
How many songs still unwritten
How many ships
Of the line have come and gone
In the good old days
May they never be forgotten
They had heavy wind
Or they had no wind at all 

A passing ship
It is midnight on the ocean
Had a real long trip
I have been at sea all winter
When my ship came in
I was givin' up the ghost
I think I should be
Leavin' those passing ships alone 

When the sea runs high
The sea runs wild and I'm unsteady
And I think of you
In the warmth of your home and family
When love is true
There is no truer occupation
And may this gale
Blow us to the ones we love 

Another day 
Another ocean
Give me no lip
But stand aside as I pass on
A sunlit sea
On the last day of October
How fresh the wind
Will you miss me from now on
I guess I should be
Leavin' passing ships alone

// I'll Tag Along //

You've got time enough for two of us
What is mine I will share
We've got things that we can do without
Most anytime anywhere
Every little daydream that appears in all we do
Gives us some problems of our own
If you turn back to that page again
And you can't win
If you ask me I'll tag along 
Paper matches in the afternoon
Cups of tea and all of that Zen
I think it's time we took a walk outside
It seems there is no oxygen
This time tomorrow we might all be packed and gone
I believe it's best we carry on
Smoke rings rising til they disappear
In the sky above
If you ask me I'll tag along 

Each and every bad dream will be hammered into dust
When we get back where we belong
If you ever turn that page again
And you need a friend
If you ask me I'll tag along 

This time tomorrow we might all be packed and gone
I believe it's best we carry on
Smoke rings rising til they disappear
In the sky above
If you ask me I'll tag along
