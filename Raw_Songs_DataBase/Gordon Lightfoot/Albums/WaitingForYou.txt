Album: WaitingForYou

// Restless //

There's a kind of a restless feeling and it pulls me from within
It sets my senses reeling and my wheels begin to spin
In the quietude of winter you can hear the wild geese cry
And I will always love that sound until the day I die 
There's a plain and a simple answer to each and every quest
From every quiet dance who might be a special guest
In a movie made for TV or a late night interview
You might even find them on the Young and the Restless too 

Do ya get that restless feelin' when you hear a whistle blast
Like an echo from the past
Of an old engine flyin' down a road that's ironcast 

The lake is blue, the sky is gray, the leaves have turned to gold
The wild goose will be on her way, the weather's much too cold
When the muskie and the old trout too have all gone down to rest
We will be returning to the things that we love best 

Do ya get that restless yearning when you think about your dad
And the scrimshaw that he had
Of an old schooner rovin' 'neath a sky that's ironclad 

There's a kind of a restless feeling and it catches you off guard
As we gaze off at the distance through the trees in my back yard
I can feel that restless yearning of those geese as off they roam
Then trade that for a warm bed and a place I can call home 

Will ya get that restless yearning when you hear the wicked blast
Of a spectre from the past
Of a cold diesel rollin' down a road that's built to last 

Still I get that restless feelin' when I hear a whistle blast
See an image from the past
Of an old schooner flyin' down a sky that's overcast

// Ring Them Bells //

Ring them bells ye heathen from the city that dreams
Ring them bell from the sanctuaries, 'cross the valleys and streams
For they're deep and they're wide, and the world's on its side
And time is a-runnin' backwards and so is the bride 
Ring them bells St. Peter where the four winds blow
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know
Oh it's rush hour now. on the wheel of the plow
And the sun is a-goin' down upon the sacred cow 

Ring them bells sweet Martha for the poor man's son
Ring them bells so the world will know that God is one
For the shepherd is asleep where the willow weep
And the mountain is filled with lost sheep 

Ring them bells - for the blind and the deaf
Ring them bells - all those who are left
Ring them bells - for the chosen few
Who'll judge the many when the game is through
Ring them bells - for the time that flies
For the child who cries when innocence dies 

Ring them bells St. Catherine from the top of the roof
Ring the bells from the fortress for the lilies that bloom
For the lines are long and the fighting is strong
And they're breakin' down the distance between right and wrong

// Fading Away //

I was at the breakwall, I was lookin' at the sea
In back of the eight ball in some misery
There on the horizon stood a mighty ship of fools
They were headin' into the harbor with all their broken rules 
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long way from home
Any way I can lose myself
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin', I'm
Fading away, fading away 

They sailed right to meet me, I said what's it all about
Please try to excuse me, we can work things out
If you've ever wondered if that mighty ship is real
Let me tell ya 'bout it brother, it was somethin' you could feel 

Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I let twilight set the tone
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long way to roam
Ain't livin' high on the hog right now
Time is wastin', I'm hesitatin', I'm
Fading away, fading away 

One more day on the calendar on my mind
I am down around the breakwall puttin' in some time
The whole ship of fools has gotten safely under way
And I was proud to be a part of what it was they had to say 

Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long piece from home
Any way I can lose myself
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin', I'm
Fading away, fading away
Fading away, fading away

// Only Love Would Know //

Does the light of passion still burn bright
Only love would know, my imagination
Tells me I'm a pent-up fool
In the deep end of the pool 
Is the light of passion burnin' bright
Only love would know, only love would know
She lives on the other side, you wanna know the reason why
She arrives at promises and you believe in what she says
Everywhere you go 

Is the light of passion burnin' bright
Everywhere you go, only love would know
You think you've been wronged again
Oh what a way to treat a friend
She belongs to other eyes and surely you must realize
She ain't the kind who would soon step aside
Pay any dues at the expense of her pride
Everywhere she goes, only love would know 

In the days gone by I came to believe
Everything is trust, all the rest is dust
Mother nature, mother dear, listen to us over here
Are the sounds of laughter ringing true
Only love would know, only love would do
She lives on another plane away from the drivin' rain
She says no, you say yes, and that's how it should be I guess
Only love would know 

May the light of love surround you tonight
Everywhere you go, only love would know
You think you were wrong until
You learned once and for all it's still
Once more lesson on the way
Or that is what it seemed to say
She's not the kind who would soon step down
Not the kind you would try to walk around
When only a thought would go very well
You can tell by the touch
Ah but only love would know 

Passion burnin' bright
Tears of passion late at night
Is the light of passion burning bright
Everywhereyou go, only love would know

// Welcome To Try //

I have been down in the valley of tears
I have stood on the highest peak
For the best part of a week
Battered and bruised I had pulled myself through
Every seen I would never repeat 
I have hung out with the beasts of the field
And with them I've spent many long nights
Got in some awful bad fights
I came unstuck, I was down on my luck
And I'm still gettin' over the bites 

Sounds of my own heart breaking, not to mention my mind
Nothing can hurt me, a small voice said into a mike, take a hike
No one will lead me astray anymore 
You are welcome to try if you like
Welcome to try if you like 

I had been down in the valley so long
I had almost run out of respect
Got in right up to my neck
Battered but wise to the truth and the lies
That no layman would ever accept 

Reaching for all of the good things in life
Can provide some suprises I guess
It may be the way we are dressed
These threads that you see mean so little to me
They don't count when they put us to rest 

Late about dusk I would start to feel
One more day had been lost
Nothing I'd say ever seemed to convey
How I felt with that I have dealt
All of my children are healthy and sane
They may say anything that they like
Say anything that they like 

Sitting alone in the Blue Ridge Saloon
Is no place for an angel to be
Ladies make faces at me
Battered but clean I had pulled my machine
Off the road, I was too tired to see 

Wearing a smile like the rim of a cup
I will get down to my final point
There is no one left to annoint
And the sowing of seed was it good, yes indeed
It thrills me but only to a point 

Use your imagination, try every trick in the book
My mother said with the life that I led I'd be broke
Holy smoke
All of my children are healthy and wise
They may say anything that they like
If they want ta preach and are not within reach
They may say anything that they like
Say anything that they like

// I'll Prove My Love //

Any way the wind may blow
Any way the creek may flow
Any way the crow may fly
Within the confines of the sky
I will prove my love to you
In everything I say and in all I do 
Anywhere the song is king
Anywhere the robin sings
Anywhere the lake is cold
Anywhere the bell is tolled
I will prove my love to you
In everything I say and in all I do 

Anytime our paths don't cross
And the losin' dice are tossed
Anytime you know what's best
Anytime I can't care less
I'll make it up to you
In everything I say and in all I do 

Any way the wind may blow
Any way I stub my toe
Any way the tree might bend
Any way the day might end
I will prove my love to you
In everything I say and in all I do
I will make it up to you
In everything I say and in all I do

// Waiting For You //

Say what you will, I will miss you my friends
Let me move along for the road never ends
Vowing to live till the end of all time
All the way to the ends of the earth because I'm
Waiting for you to say you will be mine 
Many long days, many long years
Many wrong plays, many wrong fears
I could be tossed in the arms of the sea
I could be caught between decks eternally
Waiting for you to ask what's keeping me 

What would we do at the end of the day
When the hours are asleep and the time slips away
Children are all that the earth has to show
Children are all that the earth wants to know
Up here in the northland, up here in the snow 

Up in the wilderness, land of our birth
Land of our toil, land of our worth
I could stay healthy and wealthy and wise
For I love the snow other snowbirds criticize
Tell that to a wife and you'll get a surprise 

The skies of North America are covered in stars
Over factories and farms, over hamlets and bars
The breeze of North America is breathless at night
Out there in the distance some souls are in flight
Some soft-hearted lovers whose goals are in sight 

Here in my on-again, off-again style
Here in my on-again, off-again smile
Here in my off-again, on-again grin
Here in my off-again, on-again skin
Waiting for you to say let us begin

// Wild Strawberries //

If I had a dollar, if I had a cent
I would play most anywhere if it would pay my rent
I'd be livin' on the downside in my old apartment
For the rest of my days 
People always ask why the world is on the run
People like you and like me
Is it really true you can really never win
Movin' to the upside, tell me when does the fun begin 

Deep as the see and as wild as the weather
We will go just you and me to pick wild strawberries together
Or be livin' on our own, in a cabin in a meadow
Or meanderin' alone, we can face the world forever or we'll
Hit the bounding main or be on a railroad train
Hit the boundless tide or be on a steamboat ride
Hit the bounding main or be on a midnight plane
Hit the pounding tide or be on a rainbow ride 

People often ask me just the way it must feel
To be standing up here with you down there
Let it now be known that throughout all of these years
I have been wearing polka dot underwear 

Deep as the sea and as wild as the weather
We will go just you and me to gather crabapples together
And be wandering along toward a cabin in the meadow
Or meandering alone, we can face the world together or we'll
Hit the bounding main or be on a railroad train
Hit the boundless tide or be on a steamboat ride
Hit the bounding main or be on a midnight plane
Hit the pounding tide or be on a rainbow ride 

People always ask why the world is on the slide
People like you and like me
Is it really true there will be no peace left to hide
Turning to the upside, when does the fun begin 

Deep as the sea and as wild as the weather
We might go just you and me to pick wild strawberries together
Or be livin' on our own in a cabin in a meadow
And the cows will come home
They can face the world forever and we'll
Hit the bounding main or be on a railroad train
Hit the boundless tide or be on a steamboat ride
Hit the bounding main or be on a midnight plane
Hit the pounding tide or be on a rainbow ride
Hit the bounding main or be on a midnight plane

// I'd Rather Press On //

Is it my imagination or is it my iron pride
I wonder if it matters much if time is on my side
I'd rather press on, I don't wanna rest easy
Anywhere I stray, I will make it a brand new day
Anyway, that's all I've got to say 
I'd rather be by the seaside, than be playin' a one night stand
I've been too wrapped up in my own dreams, I will change things if I can
I gotta press on, don't wanna rest easy
Wouldn't it feel fine to return to the women and the wine
And all of the sunshine that we knew 

You will never know what blue is until you have played the game
Till you live life in solitare where no one knows your name
I'd rather press on, I don't want to rest easy
Have it anyway you will, I will be with you right up until
The spell is broken and all is well 

If you'd rather be by the seashore, well I sure can understand
Are you too wrapped up in your own scene, I would change things if I can
I'd rather press on, don't wanna rest easy
Wouldn't it feel fine, but remembering the rhythm and the rhymes
And all of the good times makes me blue 

Wouldn't it feel fine to return to the women and the wine
And all of the sunshine that we knew

// Drink Yer Glasses Empty //

Listen up and I'll tell you what you'll do
Forget about music and alcohol to
Forget about yer baby, we've got other work for you
Better drink yer glasses empty now, it's time to rise 'n shine
There's one less cause in the world to be leavin' for 
It was back in '39 when I was one year old
Sitting by the backyard fence and the world had turned to cold
Drink yer glasses empty now was all that they were told
Drink yer glasses girls and boys, it's time to hit the sky
To the tune of thunder, there's no time to wonder why 

We'd love to take life over, that is plain
Forget about sorrow, forget about pain
And watch a John Wayne movie to remind us once again
Better drink yer glasses empty now, it's time to hit the line
You got one less cause in the world to be leavin' for
Drink yer glasses girls and boys, it's time to hit the sky
To the tune of thunder, there's a tear in every eye 

I'd like to take things one at a time
Forget about reason, forget about rhyme
Because beg, steal, or borrow you got another hill to climb
So drink yer glasses empty now, it's time to hit the road
There's one less cause in the world to be leavin' for
Drink yer glasses girls and boys, it's time to hit the sky
To the tune of thunder, there's no time to wonder why 

We'd like to take life over again
When time of war had passed away into the rain
And watch a John Wayne movie to remind us of the planes
Just drink yer glasses empty now, it's time to rise 'n shine
There's one less cause in the world to be leavin' for
