Album: Sundown

// Somewhere U.S.A. //

Out on the road like a low-down Joe
And the bar where we are is so cool I'd like to stay
Misunderstood like I knew I would be
The one I care for don't mind, she's built that way
I would gladly offer you my love
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A. 
This rental car never went so far
But with each passing mile one more dream has turned to clay
Now that we've met and your eyes are all wet
Let me fetch my guitar, there's a song I'd like to play
I would gladly offer you my song
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A. 

One never knows where the good times go
If you got some to spend, we'll do anything you say
I'd never lie, well you know I've tried
Though you think it's the drink that has made me behave this way
I would gladly offer you my love
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A.

// High And Dry //

With ladylike devotion, she sails the bitter ocean,
if it wasn't for lovesick sailors,
there'd be nothin' left but flotsam.

Singin' why, me oh my, is there a better man than I?
I hope you find your way back home,
before you're lyin, high and dry,
I hope you find your way back home before you die.

Her sails below like bubbles, 
while you sip your daily doubles,
if she wasn't so fond of the weather,
she might give the deckhands trouble,

Singin' why, me oh my, is there a better man than I?
I hope you find your way back home,
before you're lyin, high and dry,
I hope you find your way back home before you die.

One day when I grew older, 
I found I could not hold her,
she took on a fine young skipper,
who soon ran her up on a boulder.

Singin' why, me oh my, is there a better man than I?
I hope you find your way back home,
before you're lyin, high and dry,
I hope you find your way back home before you die.

Now the pleasures of the harbor, 
don't include a lady barber,
if it wasn't for Long John Silver,
all of us pirates would've been martyrs,

Singin' why, me oh my, is there a better man than I?
I hope you find your way back home,
before you're lyin, high and dry,
I hope you find your way back home,
before you're lyin, high and dry,
I hope you find your way back home before you die.

// Seven Island Suite //

Seven islands to the high side of the bay, 'cross the bay
To the sunset through the blue light of a fiery autumn haze
We went walking on the high side of the bay on a chilly morn
And we saw how leaves had fallen on the beds where trees are born
Any man in his right mind could not fail to be made aware
Any woman with a gift of wisdom would not seek her answers there 
Seven islands to the high side of the bay if you're looking west
To the sunset you can see it, all in fiery autumn dress
Anytime would be the right time to come up to your bed of boughs
Anybody with a wish to wander could not fail but to be aroused 

Living high in the city, guess you think it's a pretty good way
You get to learn but when you get burned you got nothing to say
You seem to think because you got chicken to go you're in luck
Fortune will not find you in your mansion or your truck
Brothers will desert you when you're down and shit out'a luck 

Look around at the morning, guess you're doing the best you can
Surely you know that when you go nobody gives you a hand
Think of the air you're breathing in, think of the time you waste
Think of the right and wrong and consider the frown on your face 

It's time you tried living on the high side of the bay, you need a rest
Any woman or a man with a wish to fade away could be so blessed
Fortune will not find you in your mansion turned to gold
Brothers will desert you when your nights turn long and cold 

If you feel it you better believe it, you're gonna see it, do you really know
It is rising like a feather, dipping and dancing from below
There's a new wave that is breaking in the wake of a passing ship
Every nation's gonna be shaken, put it together, don't let it slip 

It's time you tried living on the high side of the bay, you need a rest
Any man or a woman with a wish to fade away could be so blessed 

Seven islands to the high side of the bay, 'cross the bay
To the sunset through the blue light of a fiery autumn haze
To the sunset through the blue light of a fiery autumn haze

// Circle Of Steel //

Rows of lights in a circle of steel
Where you place your bets on a great big wheel
High windows flickerin' down through the snow
A time you know
Sights and sounds of the people goin' 'round
Everybody's in step with the season 

A child is born to a welfare case
Where the rats run around like they own the place
The room is chilly, the building is old
That's how it goes
The doctor's found on his welfare round
And he comes and he leaves on the double 

Deck The Halls was the song they played
In the flat next door where they shout all day
She tips her gin bottle back till it's gone
The child is strong
A week, a day, they will take it away
For they know about all her bad habits 

Christmas dawns and the snow lets up
And the sun hits the handle of her heirloom cup
She hides her face in her hands for a while
Says look here child
Your father's pride was his means to provide
And he's servin' three years for that reason 

Rows of lights in a circle of steel
Where you place your bets on a great big wheel
High windows flickerin' down through the snow
A time you know
Sights and sounds of the people goin' 'round
Everybody's in step with the season

// Is There Anyone Home //

Is there anyone home in this house made of stone?
Anyone inside know my name
I've been around for a half of a hundred days.
Never saw a door shut so tight
Turn around, don't look down
There's a man behind you with a gun 
Like any wandering child in the wilderness,
Wild and uncaged are your ways
I think I heard
Someone stirred
I think I heard
Someone stirred 

There's a light around you
I've come to switch it on
It will brighten every room
Don't be ashamed if you feel a whole lot warmer in you heart.
You got that feelin' in your soul 

Is there anyone home in this house made of stone?
Anyone in there who might care
I've grown weary and wise and I feel much amazed.
Got a few good tales to unwind
Turn around, don't look down
There's a man behind you with a gun.
Like any wandering minstrel I've dawned in the house of a thousand delights. 

I think I heard
Someone stirred
I think I heard
Someone stirred
I think I heard
Someone stirred
I think I heard
Someone stirred
I think I heard
Someone stirred
I think I heard
Someone stirred

// The Watchman's Gone //

Just like birds of a feather
We too have followed the golden sun
It feels so good, 
Knowin' the watchman's gone 
If I give you a rose, buddy
Would you please bury it in the fields?
I seen a rose
Watchin' it all fold out 

There's a train down at the station
It's come to carry my bones away
Two engines on
Twenty-one coaches long
End to end
Twenty-one coaches bend
The watchman's out
Kickin' the bums about 

If I wait for the right moment
You can bet I'll climb aboard unseen
I've done it before
I know I can do it in my sleep 

The watchman's out
Kickin' the bums about
The watchman's out
Kickin' your dreams about 

As I leave you in the sunset
Got one more nothin' I'd like to say
"You don't know me
A son of the sea am I"
As I say to you, my brother
If you live to follow the golden sun
You better beware
Knowin' the watchman's always there 

If you find me feedin' daisies
Please turn my face up to the sky
And leave me be
Watchin' the moon roll by
Whatever I was
You know it was all because
I've been on the town
Washin' the bullshit down 

The watchman's out
Kickin' your dreams about
It feels so good
Knowin' the watchman's gone
It's like a song
Knowin' the watchman's gone

// Sundown //

I can see her lying back in her satin dress
In a room where you do what you don't confess

Sundown, you better take care
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs
Sundown, you better take care
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs

She's been looking like a queen in a sailor's dream
And she don't always say what she really means

Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feeling better when I'm feeling no pain
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feeling better when I'm feeling no pain

I can picture every move that a man could make
Getting lost in her loving is your first mistake

Sundown, you better take care
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winning when I'm losing again

I can see her looking fast in her faded jeans
She's a hard loving woman, got me feeling mean

Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feeling better when I'm feeling no pain
Sundown, you better take care
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs
Sundown, you better take care
If I find you been creeping 'round my back stairs
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winning when I'm losing again

// Carefree Highway //

Picking up the pieces of my sweet shattered dream
I wonder how the old folks are tonight
Her name was Ann and I'll be damned if I recall her face
She left me not knowing what to do

Carefree highway, let me slip away on you
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The morning after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away, slip away on you

Turning back the pages to the times I love best
I wonder if she'll ever do the same
Now the thing that I call living is just being satisfied
With knowing I got no one left to blame

Carefree highway, got to see you my old flame
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The morning after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away, slip away on you

Searching through the fragments of my dream shattered sleep
I wonder if the years have closed her mind
I guess it must be wanderlust or trying to get free
From the good old faithful feeling we once knew

Carefree highway, let me slip away on you
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The morning after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away, slip away on you
Let me slip away on you
Carefree highway, got to see you my old flame
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The morning after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree Highway, let me slip away, slip away on you

// The List //

There's a little room on my list for tonight
Will ya be the one to fill it in
Toss around what is up, what is down 
In between, would ya like to dream
Step on in, ya don't have to play to win
But then you might 

There's a little song on my list for tonight
Would ya like to try and make it rhyme
Sing and sway, if your heart feels that way
We can leave the blues behind 

There's a little lovin' on my list for tonight
With a bit of luck, I'll check it off
Toss around what is up, what is down 

In between, d' ya know what I mean
Rain, rain all day long
You've made it pay, you can do no wrong tonight
Pick and grin, ya don't have to play to win
But then you might
Thick and thin, ya don't have to play to win
But then you might 

There's a little room on my list for tonight
Will ya be the one to fill it in
Toss around what is up, what is down 

In between, would ya like to dream
Step on in, ya don't have to play to win
But then you might
Thick and thin, ya don't have to play to win
But then you might

// Too Late For Prayin' //

It was only yesterday
When I heard the teacher say
Patiently, one and two make three
We were children, you and me
Let us pray for the ones they call
The children of today 
Nothin' left but promises
Nothin' much is certain
All we see is want and need across the board, why thank you lord
We're livin' in the glory of your care
Skies of blue have all turned brown
To the sound of cryin
Lord abide, let us stem the tide
Of broken dreams
Sometimes you seem to tell us
It's too late for prayin' 

See the ocean wild and blue
Think of all that's in her
She will not surrender to the likes of us, but then she must
They tell us, wise men tell us, it's too late
For each child with eyes that smile
There'll be ten more cryin'
Lord abide, let us stem the time
Of helplessness
But then I guess we're livin'
Is it too late for prayin' 

Nothin' here but grains of sand
Nothin' much worth savin'
Guess we've all got problems of our own to bear, and still we share
Tomorrow could get better than today
To the ones who've loved in vain
Will ya be beholden
Lord abide, let us stem the tide
Of broken dreams
Sometimes ya seem to tell us
It's too late for prayin'
