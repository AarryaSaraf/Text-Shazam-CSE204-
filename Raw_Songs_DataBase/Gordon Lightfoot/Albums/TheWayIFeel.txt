// The Way I Feel //

The way I feel is like a robin
whose babes have flown to come no more
like a tall oak tree alone and cryin'
when the birds have flown and the nest is bare 
Now a woman Lord is like a young bird
and the tall oak tree is a young man's heart
among his boughs you'll find her nesting
when the nights are cool she's warm and dry 

Your coat of green it will protect her
her wings will grow your love will too
But all too soon your mighty branches
will cease to hold her and she'll fly from you 

Now the way I feel is like a robin
whose babes have flown to come no more
like a  tall oak tree alone and cryin'
when the birds have flown and the nest is bare
when the birds have flown and the nest is bare

// Walls //

I'm not ashamed
To say that I've loved you well
I'm not ashamed
To let you know
I'm just a name that's all
Scratched upon your wall
You've used it well but what the hell
That's what walls are for 
I'm not ashamed
To listen to the fast-fallin' rain
In the morning upon my window
I'm not afraid to cry
I'm not ashamed to try
To be your friend once again
'Cause that's what's friends are for 

Friends are for sorting out the hang-ups that we hide 
Walls are for shutting out the love we feel inside 

I'm not ashamed no to talk it over once again 
To rearrange my vocabulary
But I can't seem to find 
Any words to change your mind 
Because I left them all behind
And that's what words are for 

Words are for explaining the mistakes we might have made
Names are for calling when there's nothing left to say 

I'm not ashamed, no, to say that I've loved you well 
I'm not ashamed, and yet I know
I'm just a name, that's all
Scratched upon your wall
You've used it well, but what the hell
That's what walls are for 

I'm not ashamed of wearing out my old grey socks 
Chasing you around the back woods
I'm not ashamed to darn
Nor to proud to find some yarn
To sew them up once again
'Cause that's what socks are for

// If You Got It //

If you got it
Don't lose it girl it's got to be
The one creative thing that's left for you and me 
If you find it
Don't lose it all the very next day
Lock it in your soul and throw the key away 
So, don't you let it go
Let it stay let it grow
Like the snow
Don't let it melt away
If you find it
Then give it girl with all your might
Forget about yourself you're not the losin' kind 

If you get it
Then keep it cool don't let it die
You may only see it once don't let it pass you by 
So don't you let it go
Let it stay let it grow
Like the snow
Don't let it melt away 

If you find it
Then give it girl with all your might
Forget about yourself you're not the losin' kind 

If you get it
Then keep it cool don't let it die
You may only see it once don't let it pass you by 
Pass you by, don't let it die
Don't let it go

// Crossroads //

When first I did appear upon this native soil
All up and down this country at labor I did toil
I slumbered in the moonlight and I rose with the sun
I rambled through the canyons where the cold rivers run 
When first I did come down where the land meets the sea
The people said Who are you and what would your name be
I said I have no home and I am no man's son 
'Twas inland I was born and from inland that I come 

In the good land I was young and I was strong
No one dared to call me son
Happy just to see my day's work done
See my day's work done 

So I swung an axe as a timberjack
And I worked the Quebec mines
And on the golden prairie I rode the big combines
I sailed the maritime waters of many a seaport town
Built the highways and the byways to the western salmon grounds 

I've gazed upon the good times I've seen the bad times too
Felt many a cold and bitter wind and many a mornin' dew
I've watched the country growin' like a fair and mighty thing
And on the still of a summer night I've heard the mountains ring 

In the good land I was young and I was strong
No one dared to call me son
Happy just to see my day's work done
See my day's work done 

But now the seeds are planted and the gates are open wide
The old ways are forgotten there's no place left to hide
And the legacy I'm leavin' you is not very hard to find
You'll see it all around you at this crossroads of time
In the sweet soil it's a-growin' At the crossroads of time

// A Minor Ballad //

Beyond the wild misty mountain
Within the valley so free
There dwells a maid with a heart so mellow 
Soft as the wind and wild as the sea
When will you love me
As I love thee 
I have no gold to give her
Nor gowns of soft crimson hue
Nor poems of love no rhymes to bring her 
Into my heart so strong so true
When will you love me
As I love you 

Beyond the wild misty mountain
Within the valley so free
There dwells a maid with a heart so mellow 
Soft as the wind and wild as the sea
When will you love me
As I love thee?

// Go-Go Round //

Alone upon the sidewalks of despair
'Twas there she wandered
With her suitcase in her hand
Her fate she pondered
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care 
She met him on a night so rare when her friends were there 
And the band was groovin' 
When he gave a glance that said how much he would like to meet her
How was she to know at the time
He would mistreat her 

In her case she danced for him although a hundred eyes were turned her way
And before the set was through he knew
She would be his loved one 

Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere 

He's playin' up in Michigan with a group they call The Intended
With a kiss, and a promise, he was gone
The song was ended 

But as she walks, she waits for him the pavement is a shoulder for her tears
But in her heart she knows there is no way
She can hope to change him 

Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere 

Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care 
A go-go girl in love

// Rosanna //

Rosanna makes my day begin
With kisses for a king
And coffee on a silver tray
She sees the shape I'm in
And if she should ever break away
I'd follow close behind her
'Cause Rosanna yes Rosanna
Rules my heart 
Rosanna knows the times I keep
A fire softly glows
And the shadows lick the walls
She knows when I'm asleep
The dinner's served at eight o'clock on time
And all is well by nine
'Cause Rosanna yes Rosanna
Rules my heart 

Rosanna moves across the floor
Her perfume fills the air
As she walks beside my easy chair
I touch her hand once more
And I may never sleep again
I like the bag she put me in 

Rosanna knows the ways of a man
But not the way I feel
I don't really care what happens now
It's catch me if you can
For no matter what occasion should arise
She likes to sympathize
'Cause Rosanna yes Rosanna
Rosanna, Rosanna
Rules my heart

// Home From The Forest //

Oh the neon lights were flashin'
And the icy wind did blow
The water seeped into his shoes
And the drizzle turned to snow
His eyes were red, his hopes were dead
And the wine was runnin' low
And the old man came home
From the forest 
His tears fell on the sidewalk
As he stumbled in the street
A dozen faces stopped to stare
But no one stopped to speak
For his castle was a hallway
And the bottle was his friend
And the old man stumbled in
From the forest 

Up a dark and dingy staircase
The old man made his way
His ragged coat around him
As upon his cot he lay
And he wondered how it happened
That he ended up this way
Getting lost like a fool
In the forest 

And as he lay there sleeping
A vision did appear
Upon his mantle shining
A face of one so dear
Who had loved him in the springtime
Of a long-forgotten year
When the wildflowers did bloom
In the forest 

She touched his grizzled fingers
And she called him by his name
And then he heard the joyful sound
Of children at their games
In an old house on a hillside
In some forgotten town
Where the river runs down
From the forest 

With a mighty roar the big jets soar
Above the canyon streets
And the con men con but life goes on
For the city never sleeps
And to an old forgotten soldier
The dawn will come no more
For the old man has come home
From the forest

// Song For A Winter's Night //

The lamp is burnin' low upon my table top
The snow is softly falling
The air is still in the silence of my room
I hear your voice softly calling

If I could only have you near
To breathe a sigh or two
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
On this winter night with you

The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead
My glass is almost empty
I read again between the lines upon the page
The words of love you sent me

If I could know within my heart
That you were lonely too
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
On this winter night with you

The fire is dying now, my lamp is growing dim
The shades of night are lifting
The morning light steals across my window pane
Where webs of snow are drifting

If I could only have you near
To breathe a sigh or two
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love
And to be once again with with you
To be once again with you
