With ladylike devotion, she sails the bitter ocean,
if it wasn't for lovesick sailors,
there'd be nothin' left but flotsam.

Singin' why, me oh my, is there a better man than I?
I hope you find your way back home,
before you're lyin, high and dry,
I hope you find your way back home before you die.

Her sails below like bubbles, 
while you sip your daily doubles,
if she wasn't so fond of the weather,
she might give the deckhands trouble,

Singin' why, me oh my, is there a better man than I?
I hope you find your way back home,
before you're lyin, high and dry,
I hope you find your way back home before you die.

One day when I grew older, 
I found I could not hold her,
she took on a fine young skipper,
who soon ran her up on a boulder.

Singin' why, me oh my, is there a better man than I?
I hope you find your way back home,
before you're lyin, high and dry,
I hope you find your way back home before you die.

Now the pleasures of the harbor, 
don't include a lady barber,
if it wasn't for Long John Silver,
all of us pirates would've been martyrs,

Singin' why, me oh my, is there a better man than I?
I hope you find your way back home,
before you're lyin, high and dry,
I hope you find your way back home,
before you're lyin, high and dry,
I hope you find your way back home before you die.
