Travel with me if you choose
Into a land of notions
Through the ruins of yesteryear
Set yer mind in motion
Be beside me win or lose
I will no forsake thee
I must do, so must you
Now will you go with me 
I will build a home for you
To keep you warm each winter
Lemon lilies at your door
To give you in September
I will take you as you stand
I promise to defend thee
I must do, so must you
Now will you go with me 

Whisper my name as you pass through my life
Whisper my name when you fall
I'm just a dusty old mem'ry ya trust
I'll be close by when you call 

Give and take ain't always so
Seeing is believing
Down and out don't stop the show
Staying is not leaving
What we say ain't always so
But I won't deceive thee
I must do, so must you
Now will you go with me 

Talk to me, run to me, whisper my name
Don't waste your love makin' friends
We've both had enough of that wonderful stuff
It's too easy to sin 

Travel with me if you choose
Into a land of notions
Through the ruins of yesteryear
Set yer mind in motion
Be beside me win or lose
I will no forsake thee
I must do, so must you
Now will you go with me 

Travel with me if you choose
I promise to protect thee
I must do, so must you
Now will you go with me
Now will you go with me
