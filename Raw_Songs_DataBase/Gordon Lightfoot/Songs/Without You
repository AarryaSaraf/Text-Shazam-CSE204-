If I can last through another sunrise
In the past I knew what to do
But this was such a grim surprise
If I wait for the sun to shine
How can I pass the time
Without you, without you 
If I can break the spell that is in me
Any fool would no where to go
I guess I'd better send a mayday
If I find me a rainbow's end
how will I find it then
Without you, without you
Without you 

Wait 'til I see you next time
Maybe I'll lose my mind
Livin' without you 

If I can last, wait until the wind dies
I've been all up and down like a clown
And this is such a thin disguise
If I wait for the sun to shine
How will I pass the time
Without you, without you
Without you 

Wait 'til I see you next time
Maybe I'll lose my mind
Livin' without you
Without you, without you
Without you, without you
