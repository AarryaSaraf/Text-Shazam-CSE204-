The soul is the rock and the rock will not be moved
Nothing is disputed, yet nothing is disproved
And the seeds of the earth that were planted long ago
Still yield a better harvest than the rock was prone to grow 
Say what you like to, do what you do
Everyone's sleeping now two by two
Bats in the roof, cats in the hall
Dust on the stairway, gnats on the wall 

Big rain comin'
Big rain comin' this way
Rain on the rock
Rain on the rock
Rain on the rock 

The sea is the space which the rock has displaced
The mind is some stranger that some soul has embraced
And somewhere between, in a no-man's land of dreams
The heart becomes the soldier yet the rock is not redeemed 

Say what you like to, do what you can
Live like a sheep, die like a lamb
Bats in the roof, cats in the hall
Dust on the stairway, gnats on the wall 

Big rain comin'
Big rain comin' this way
Rain on the rock
Rain on the rock
Rain on the rock 

The soul is the rock and the rock will always roll
In circles 'round the sun doing rings around the pole
When the mind is not sure what the heart will do next
The rock becomes the master and the road becomes what's left 

Late one night when the moon shone down
We went to the mill on the edge of the town
She wore white, I wore black
The town was sleeping when we got back 

Big rain comin'
Big rain comin' this way
Rain on the rock
Rain on the rock
Rain on the rock 

The soul is the rock and the rock will not be harmed
Though man must be cheated just as women must be charmed
And the mind is the light for the heart which cannot see
The soul becomes the stranger but the rock will always be 

Say what you like to, do what you do
Everyone's sleeping now two by two
Bats in the roof, cats in the hall
Dust on the stairway, gnats on the wall 

Oh.. Big rain comin'
Big rain comin' this way
Rain on the rock
Rain on the rock
Rain on the rock 

The soul is the rock and the rock will not be moved
Nothing is disputed yet nothing is disproved
And the seeds of the earth that were planted long ago
Still yield a better harvest than the rock was prone to grow 

And the seeds of the earth that were planted long ago
Still yield a better harvest than the rock was prone to grow
