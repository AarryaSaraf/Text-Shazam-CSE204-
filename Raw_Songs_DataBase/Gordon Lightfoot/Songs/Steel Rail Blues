Well I got my mail late last night
A letter from a girl who found the time to write
To her lonesome boy somewheres in the night
She sent me a railroad ticket too
To take me to her lovin' arms
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love 

Well I been out here many long days
I haven't found a place that I could call my own
Not a two bit bed to lay my body on
I been stood up I bin shook down
I been dragged into the sand
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love 

Well I been uptight most every night
Walkin' along the streets of this old town
Not a friend around to tell my troubles to
My good old car she done broke down
'Cause I drove it into the ground
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love 

Well I look over yonder across the plain
The big drive wheels are poundin' along the ground
Gonna get on board and I'll be homeward bound
Now I ain't had a home cooked meal 
And Lord I need one now
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love 

Now here I am with my hat in my hand
Standin' on the broad highway will you give a ride
To a lonesome boy who missed the train last night
I went in town for one last round
And I gambled my ticket away
And the big steel rail won't carry me home to the one I love
