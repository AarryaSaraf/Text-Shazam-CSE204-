That long thin dawn
That long thin dawn
Is comin' on again 
I've seen the hills of Frisco and the streets of Montreal
In every town I've been to I've had someone to call
From Winnipeg to Edmonton, Vancouver to St. Paul
I've had so many good friends I couldn't miss them all 

And that long thin dawn
That long thin dawn
Is comin' on again 

Last night I came to Denver beneath the snow-capped ridge
I thought about my darlin' as I stood beneath the bridge
And there were times I made her cry but I guess by now she's learned
That any time I've wandered I always have returned 

And that long thin dawn
That long thin dawn
Is comin' on again 

Right now I'm on a highway just east of Omaha
Riding shotgun on the biggest rig you ever saw
With forty tons of pig iron and a trucker known as Bill
All the way to Windsor, we've got some miles to kill 

And that long thin dawn
That long thin dawn
Is comin' on again 

While climbin' up a hillside, Bill drops 'er down a gear
And the engine sings so sweetly 'tis music to my ear
I tell him how I long to be just like him if I can
Drivin' like the restless wind across this precious land 

Says Bill "the air is clean tonight" as he puffs a big cigar
"And if this rig keeps rollin', my boy you'll travel far
But when you are a trucker you'll come to realize
The only thing a man can do is watch the world go by" 

And that long thin dawn
That long thin dawn
Is comin' on again 

That long thin dawn
That long thin dawn
Is comin' on again
