Touch me
Every minute, please touch me
Oh I see you pass my way again
And your call, call yourself my friend
Well let me tell you what's good to be
It's no no more than your love cannot be
So touch me said I ride on
Just a ride oh as I'm riding I'll be, o yeah

Oh I see you pass my way again
And your call, call yourself my friend
Well let me tell you what's good to be
We two cannot walk unless we agree
So touch me
Every minute
