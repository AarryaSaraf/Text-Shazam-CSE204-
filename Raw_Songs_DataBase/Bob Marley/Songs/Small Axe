Why boasteth thyself
Oh, he-vil man
Playing smart
And not being clever, oh, no
I said you're working iniquity
To achieve vanity, yeah, if a-so a-so
But the goodness of Jah-Jah
I-dureth for-i-ver

If you are the big tree
We are the small axe
Sharpened to cut you down (Well sharp)
Ready to cut you down, oh, yeah

These are the words
Of my master, keep on telling me, oh
No weak heart shall prosper, oh, no, they can't, eh, eh

Whosoever diggeth a pit, Lord
Shall fall in it, shall fall in it
Whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall bury in it, shall bury in it

If you are the big tree
We are the small axe
Sharpened to cut you down
Ready to cut you down

Eh, whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it, fall in it, eh
Whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall bury in it, shall bury in it

If you have a big tree
We have a small axe
Ready to cut you down (Well sharp)
Sharpened to cut you down, oh

If you are the big tree, let me tell you this
We are the small axe
Ready to cut you down (Well sharp)
Sharpened to cut you down
If you are the big tree
We are the small axe
