You running and you running
And you running away
You running and you running
And you running away
You running and you running
And you running away
You running and you running
But you can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself

You must have done (must have done)
Somethin' wrong (something wrong)
Said: you must have done (must have done)
Wo! Somethin' wrong (something wrong)
Why you can't find the
Place where you belong?
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (running away)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (running away)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (running away)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (running away)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (running away)

Every man thinketh his
Burden is the heaviest (heaviest)
Every man thinketh his
Burden is the heaviest (heaviest)
You still mean it: Who feels it knows it, Lord
Who feels it knows it, Lord
Who feels it knows it, Lord
Who feels it knows it, Lord

You running and you running
And you running away
You running and you running
And you running away
You running and you running
And you running away
You running and you running
But you can't run away from yourself
Could you run away from yourself?
Can you run away from yourself?
Can't run away from yourself!
Can't run away from yourself!
Yeah-eah-eah-eah - from yourself

Brr - you must have done somethin'
Somethin' - somethin' - somethin'
Somethin' you don't want nobody to know about:
You must have, Lord - somethin' wrong
What you must have done - you must have done somethin' wrong
Why you can't find where you belong?

Well, well, well, well, you running away, heh, no
You running away, ooh, no, no, no
I'm not (running away), no, don't say that - don't say that
'Cause (running away) I'm not running away, ooh! (running away)
I've got to protect my life, (running away)
And I don't want to live with no strife. (running away)
It is better to live on the housetop (running away)
Than to live in a house full of confusion. (running away)
So, I made my decision and I left you; (running away)
Now you comin' to tell me (running away)
That I'm runnin' away. (running away)
But it's not true, (running away)
I am not runnin' away. (running away)
