Ooh ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Slave driver
The table has turned (Catch a fire)
Catch a fire (Catch a fire)
So you can get burned now
(Catch a fire)

Slave driver
The table has turned (Catch a fire)
Catch a fire (Catch a fire)
You're gonna get burned
(Catch a fire)

Whoa now

Every time I hear the crack of a whip
My blood runs cold
I remember on the slave ship
How they brutalize our very souls
Today they say that we are free
Only to be chained in poverty
Good God, I think it's illiteracy
It's only a machine that make money

(Slave driver)
The table has turned, y'all
(Ooh ooh ooh)
(Slave driver, ugh)
The table has turned, baby now! (Catch a fire)
(Catch a fire)
So you can get burned, baby now! (Catch a fire)
(Slave driver)
The table is turned y'all (Catch a fire)
(Catch a fire)
So you can get burned now (Catch a fire)

Every time I hear the crack of a whip
My blood runs cold
I remember on the slave ship
How they brutalize our very souls
(Ooh ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh)
Oh God have mercy on our souls!
(Ooh ooh ooh)
Oh!

Slave driver
The table has turned, y'all (Catch a fire)
Catch a fire (Catch a fire)
So you can get burned
(Catch a fire)
Slave driver (Slave driver)
The table has turned, y'all (Catch a fire)
Catch a fire
So you can get burned (Catch a fire)
