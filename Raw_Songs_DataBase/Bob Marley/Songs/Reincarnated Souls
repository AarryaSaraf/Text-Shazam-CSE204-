(We are reincarnated souls from that time)
And we are living on earth
Heat air and water (This time)

(We are reincarnated souls from that time)
And we are living on earth
Heat air and water (This time)

In the beginning was the word
And the word manifested itself in the flesh
Which even became man, all because of the divine plan
Man being lowered and the angel
Over all the earth was he given dominion
He devised his own destruction
(But the word lives on and on)

(He who is weary)Let him come hither
(He who has eyes to see)Let him look yonder
(All who are thirsty)Let them drink clear water
(Drink water, drink water)

(We are reincarnated souls from that time)
And we are living on earth
Heat air and water (This time)

(We are reincarnated souls from that time)
And we are living on earth
Heat air and water (This time)

Nothing is new under the sun;
All has been here since time begun
With all the years we spent
(Only changing names protect the innocent)
Like seed that is planted by the water
A prayer to die before new birth
Changing its form to another
Taking on a structure just as the first

(He who is weary)Let him come hither
(He who has eyes to see)Let him look yonder
(All who are thirsty)Let them drink clear water
(Drink water, drink water)
