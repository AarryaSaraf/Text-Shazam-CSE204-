There she goes, with the pieces from my heart
There she goes, and now my teardrops start

And here I go, once again
Through these lonely heartaches and pain
That's all remain, all remain
Now I know, love is a guessing game

She goes, with the pieces from my heart
There she goes, and now my teardrops start

Who's gonna put back, the pieces, to my broken heart? (ooh ooh ooh)
Once again, once again, now I know, this could be the end
And she gone (with the pieces from my heart)
There she goes, let me tell ya (and now my teardrops start)

And here I go, once again
Through these lonely heartaches and pain
That's all remain
Now I know, this could be the end
She goes (with the pieces from my heart)

There she goes, and now my teardrops start
There she goes, with the pieces from my heart
(Pieces, pieces from mine heart)
Then, there she goes
