Nobody knows the troubles I bear
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
(Nobody knows it, none at all)
Nobody knows the heartaches I share
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
Nobody knows it (nobody knows it, none at all)

Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down (oh, my Lord)
Sometimes I feel like running away (oh, my Lord)
Oh, my Lord

Nobody knows, I say, the heartaches that I share
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
(Nobody knows it, none at all), nobody knows it!
I said, nobody knows the troubles I bear
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
(Nobody knows it, none at all)

Some say that I'm lazy, some say that I'm crazy (oh, my Lord)
And at the times when I'm sad, some say I'm mad (oh, my Lord)
Oh, my Lord

I said, nobody, nobody knows
Nobody knows the troubles, the troubles that I bear
Nobody knows it
Nobody else knows it, nobody knows it, nobody knows it
None at all, I say how much I
Nobody knows the heartaches I share, nobody knows it
(Nobody knows it, none at all)

Some say that I'm lazy, some say that I'm crazy (oh, my Lord)
And at times when I'm sad, some say I'm mad (oh, my Lord)
Oh, my Lord, only you know, only you know
