Yes, me friend
We de a street again
Yes, me friend, me good friend
Them say we free again

The bars could not hold me
Force could not control me, now
They try to keep me down
But Jah put I around
Yes, I've been accused, many a times
And wrongly abused now
But through the powers of the Most High
They've got to turn me loose

Don't try to cold me up on this bridge, now
I've got to reach Mount Zion
The highest region
If you a bull-bucker
Let me tell you this
I'm a duppy conqueror, conqueror

Yes, me friend, me good friend
We de a street again
Yes, me friend, me good friend
Them say we free again

Don't try to cold me up on this bridge, now
I've got to reach Mount Zion
The highest region
So if you a bull-bucker
Let me tell you this
I'm a duppy conqueror, conqueror

Yes, me friend
Them say we're free again
Yes, me friend, me good friend
Them set de a street again
