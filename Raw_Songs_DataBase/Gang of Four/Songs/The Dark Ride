I wore out time
Used up all that should be mine
Shit faced, watch soaps
I only laugh at my own jokes

Gunfingered, I pop
Competitors on gameshow spots
Lucked out, she wins
A home to fake orgasms in

Sirens they call to me
"Come on the dark ride"
Sirens they call me
In from the outside

The dark ride, the dark ride
Sirens call me on the dark ride

Idle, I pray
Wish me on a holiday
No sweat, I kneel
Faking hope until it's real

I drowned the years
In a honeymooner's tears
Stranger, here's the proof
That's me in the photo booth

Sirens they call to me
"Come on the dark ride"
Sirens they call me
In from the outside

The dark ride, the dark ride
Sirens call me on the dark ride

The dark ride, the dark ride
Sirens call me on the dark ride

(Unintelligible)
I'll make your bad times disappear
Don't need a shrink, I got no fear

I'll make your bad times disappear
Don't need a shrink, I got no fear
Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear

The dark ride, the dark ride
Sirens call me

The dark ride, the dark ride
Sirens call me, sirens call me

The dark ride, the dark ride
Sirens call me, sirens call me

The dark ride, the dark ride
Sirens call me on the dark ride
