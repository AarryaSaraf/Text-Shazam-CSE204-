If I keep my eyes on it
I will have more than I might need
To have the fingers crossed for
The break that I'm not sure may be
It don't matter
It don't matter
It don't matter
Before they slip away
Just look at where I'm at today
Not bad, huh, what do you say?
If I take the chance that comes
Put life into the days
Before they slip away
Make sure that times no luxury
To check off all the days
Before they slip away
It don't matter...
(Let's surrender, it's not our fight)
Remember when I was a child
I looked for things all the while
But look at where I am today
Not bad, huh?
It don't matter...
