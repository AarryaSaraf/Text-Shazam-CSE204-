All unplanned
All unplanned

There you go

And I'm at the top of the tree
If you're an Alpha Male like me
And you think it's pretty good as it stands
Magic Mirror, where do we go?
And was this all unplanned
Or are we heading for the Fatherland?

Night vision sex, for all your tomorrows
Yearning, shame and sorrow
If you've been affected by stories, depraved
There's help online for all the issues raised

What you praying for?
What you praying for?

British and American rats
Take meetings with Russian diplomats
There on the floor, in the urine pool
As a fully waxed Klaus Barbie drools

So sad, so pathetic

You don't know what you're missing

Then I awoke, but it was no dream
Ministers, oligarchs and showgirls were all with me
In a steam room with the deep fake tans
Clinging to the shipwrecks of our lives and all our plans

All unplanned
And you think it's pretty good as it stands
All unplanned
And you think it's pretty good as it stands
All unplanned
Where do we go?
All unplanned
Where do we go?

Magic Mirror, where do we go?
And was this all unplanned
Or are we heading for the Fatherland?

Then I awoke, but it was no dream
Ministers, oligarchs and showgirls were all with me
In a steam room with the deep fake tans
Clinging to the shipwrecks of our lives and all our plans
