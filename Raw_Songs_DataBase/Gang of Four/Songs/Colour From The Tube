Now that everything is true
I believe in me and you
What I see in magazines
I believe in everything

I believe in politics
When we're playing pick up sticks
I believe in five year plans
I believe it in advance

I believe in innocence
College boys wash your hands!
I believe in one night stands
No-one gets a second chance

I believe that dogs are bit
Even fakes are counterfeit
I believe the BBC
I believe in everything

So if the times don't fit
You can't go look for another
Use the colour from the tube
There is nothing else to do

So if the times don't fit
You can't go look for another
Use the colour from the tube
There is nothing else that you can do
(There is nothing else that you can do)

Now that everything is real
I believe I really feel
Even hear the churchbells ring
I believe in everything

I believe in Postman Pat
I'll leave my kidneys to the bank
I believe in even tans
I believe in everything

So if the times don't fit
You can't go look for another
Use the colour from the tube
There is nothing else to do

So if the times don't fit
You can't go look for another
Use the colour from the tube
There is nothing else for you to do
(There is nothing else for you to do)
