Innocents all, kept in the dark
Centre cannot hold, things fall apart
Sex and death walk hand in hand
And Elvis's body will never be found
Put another quarter in the bandit machine
And then you come alive in the Vegas Dream

I'm still waiting for payday to arrive
Money is law in the 10 cent store
And the groove's our only guide
In the Promised Land

Money talks in the street so we walk
Look at the world that's real, Money makes it a deal
Lovers wish in the night for something that they missed
Money talks in the street, so we walk

(U.S. forces in defence of democracy)
(Sounds complicated!)

Aliens are born in space, but make their base in Russia
The curtain tears, but Bush don't care
Fights on like General Custer
Marines maintain control
The newspaper said you can weigh the human soul
Here's the dope on Noriega's jones
A pineapple on the U.S. payroll

I'm still waiting for payday to arrive
Money is law in the 10 cent store
And the bible belts are tightening
I'm still waiting for payday to arrive
Money is law in the 10 cent store
And the groove's our only guide
In the Promised Land

Money talks in the street so we walk
Look at the world that's real, Money makes it a deal
Lovers wish in the night for something that they missed
Money talks in the street, so we walk

In the Promised Land

Money talks in the street so we walk
Look at the world that's real, Money makes it a deal
Lovers wish in the night for something that they missed
Money talks in the street, so we walk

Money talks in the street so we walk
Look at the world that's real, Money makes it a deal
Lovers wish in the night for something that they missed
Money talks in the street, so we walk
