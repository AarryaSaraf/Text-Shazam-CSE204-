Null null zero one
Shows me my life rerun
Like stupid jokes
From my favourite comedian
We made laws and bank accounts
Invented God
To tell the women what it's all about
What it's all about

We can escape the web
Don't let the monsters follow you to bed
Feed them, treat them lovingly
Then later on let them all walk free
Let them all walk free

It's not the world as you might want it
But it is what you see
And if you don't get it
Why are you asking
Why'd you keep asking me?

Don't ask me
Don't ask me
Don't ask me
Don't ask me

Stand to attention, there's work to be done
My border guards with their sub-machine guns
Sub-machine guns
It's right and it's popular and now it's time for fun
The good times have only just begun
Only just begun

It's riotously funny
I laughed myself into an early grave
As I look down on the little world
Does anyone expect to be saved?

Powerful while men rule the world
Uphold democracy
But I keep giving the wrong answers
So don't bother asking, don't ask me
