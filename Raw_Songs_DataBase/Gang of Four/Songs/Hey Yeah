Who is wanting to be perfect?
Too many angels in heaven
You're looking at a road block
At least my fingerprints are mine

Hey yeah, we got it all
Refugees come flooding in
Sell them all our cigarettes
And send them home like friends

If I can't find truth, justice, happiness
I'm wanting the new, show me something else
(Show me something else)

Say yeah when you're meaning no
Catch Beirut on the TV tonight
Fake some love at a quarter to ten
Don't admit it - what you say

Maybe the earth's still got an edge
Who cares if it's second hand
Salmonella in the batteries
This car is from Japan

If I can't find truth, justice, happiness
I'm wanting the new, show me something else
(Show me something else)

Say yeah when you're meaning no
Catch Beirut on the TV tonight
Fake some love at a quarter to ten
Don't admit it - what you say

Say yeah when you're meaning no
Catch Beirut on the TV tonight
Fake some love at a quarter to ten
Don't admit it - what you said

Say yeah when you're meaning no
Catch Beirut on the TV tonight
Fake some love at a quarter to ten
Don't admit it - what you say

(Yeah yeah...)
(Yeah yeah...)
(Yeah yeah...)
