Waiting for my elevator
I hear you don't want to delay her
I'm not looking for a confrontation
But she's looking for an explanation

Waiting for my elevator
I'm thinking I should come later
Waiting for my elevator
I'm thinking I should have come later

I tell her that I'm for the first floor
She tells me that she's for the first floor
We wait until we get to the first floor
But she don't get out the door

Waiting for my elevator
I'm thinking I should come later
Waiting for my elevator
I'm thinking I should have come later

Waiting for my elevator
I really don't know what to say her
There's something I really hate
I wish to God I could relate

Waiting for my elevator
I'm thinking I should have come later
Waiting for my elevator
I'm thinking I should have come later

Waiting for my elevator
I really don't want to delay her
I'm not looking for a confrontation
But she's looking for an explanation

Waiting for my elevator
I'm thinking I should have come later
Waiting for my elevator
I'm thinking I should have come later
