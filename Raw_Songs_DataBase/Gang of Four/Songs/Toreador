See me drive, catch the light in my car
I'm breaking all the rules
I disappear, I'm gonna reappear
In a puff of smoke, I'm here
In my despair in the maze
I curse the way she holds my gaze
Where you been? Missing you
And we've got so much catching up to do

Can you hear me now? I've been missing you
And we've got so much catching up to do
Look in my eyes, show me your respect
There's things I want to forget

Toreador
Kill the bull, the Minotaur
Then you walk through the open door

Let's celebrate me!
I'm bound, but I believe I'm free
You diggin' me? I'm your friend, family
You must never stop talking about me
Pocket dolly, plastic fork
Cappuccino foam
I get all the air in the room
'Cause that's my home

Toreador
Kill the bull, the Minotaur
Then you walk through the open door
Toreador
Kill the bull, the Minotaur
Then you walk through the open door

Get into me, friendly
Let's explore my sexuality
Lying in filth
Since 1000 BC
I never said, I never said
That I was a people person
