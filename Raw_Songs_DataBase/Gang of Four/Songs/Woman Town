This was my first night in woman town
But I somehow feel (I knew), I'd been here before
It ain't no wonder that you caught on
How long it took
I want to get all my kicks and thrills
I've seen the pictures
Enchant the eyes of all who pass by
She said it's no surprize that you wear shades
Every want rebounds from such a perfect curve
I don't need you, I'm a woman not some naming game
Somehow I know I'd been there hundreds of nights before
Woman after woman walked tall
So long back
Before we learnt to talk to you as them
And she said
I don't need for you to talk about me
You have the picture don't you see
It's no surprise that you wear shades
Every want rebounds from such a perfect curve
I don't need you, I'm a woman not some naming game
