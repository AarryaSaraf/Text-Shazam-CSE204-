Indiscernible identity
So many passing by, she seems
Silver sprayed living statue
She stands watching the absurdity

The idea of self is a placebo
Run the data, it knows where you go
I'm a construct
Oh I'm a suspect but don't want it known

Change the locks, the system's down
They say everyone's a suspect now
Don't have to change the locks, we can change our minds
Smoke signals wake the drones in the hive

Do what you want, you won't be found out
You'll never be held to account
We're just getting static on the line
A broken voice says everything's fine

You and a friend could be our guest
At our request, come and fine dine
It's our gift for you to celebrate
The last of the mall's great redesign

Change the locks, the system's down
They say everyone's a suspect now
Change the locks, don't change the plan
They're applauding me but 

The kings of comedy
The kings of comedy

Bang, bang on the drum
Bang, bang on the drum
Bang, bang but we just didn't see it

Change the locks, the system's down
They say everyone's a suspect now
Don't have to change the locks, we can change our minds
Smoke signals wake the drones in the hive
