(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)

Where once were her eyes
Ivanka now sees through pearls
She said I don't know
What it means to be complicit
Be complicit

Need to believe
You got to understand
Need to believe
You got to understand

You mustn't want the things you can't have
It's only worth something if you work for it
You mustn't want the things you can't have
It's only worth something if my name's on it

I saw how hard daddy worked for his money
Daddy loves women and he believes in family
Need to believe, you gotta understand
Need to believe

You mustn't want the things you can't have
It's only worth something if you work for it
You mustn't want the things you can't have
It's only worth something if my name's on it

She said
It's clear to me
That things would not just be given to me
Given to me
She said
It's clear to me
That things would not just be given to me
Given to me
(Given to me)
Given to me

In the morning daddy wants me in his room, it's where we get together
It's not true that daddy calls my name in stormy weather

(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)

Daddy loves women and he believes in family (In family)
He and I know the worst sins are lust and avarice (Lust and avarice)
Now we're a long way from home (A long way from home)
Now we're a long way from home

Someone said that we can make a better version of ourselves
You need to know I'll do my best for you (Do my best for you)
You need to know I'll do my best for you
