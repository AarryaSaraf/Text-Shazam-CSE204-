Don't stop out too late at night
Stop! It's a caution

Don't cross the red light
Stop! It's a caution

To act for the good for congressman is money
A balance of power will ensure our safety

(Making money is making sense)
Life!
(Making money is making sense)
It's a shame
(It's logical, making sense)
(Making money is making sense)

Don't stop out too late at night
Stop! It's a caution

Don't cross the red light
Stop! It's a caution

To act for the good for congressman is money
The right to get rich is in the constitution
Talk of corruption is to preach insurrection
Elected to power men suspend self-interest

You and I, we are satellites, it's a shame
You and I, we are satellites, it's a shame

Life!

To act for the good is to defend our homeland
A balance of power will ensure our safety
To step out of line is to risk disaster
To walk in the rain is to risk pneumonia
A balance of power will ensure our safety

You and I, we are satellites
(Making money is making sense)

It's a shame
