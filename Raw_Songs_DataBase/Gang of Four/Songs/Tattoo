(Can't make out what he is saying)
Like you
Like you

You don't know who I am
You don't know where I come from
From the soul of this land
I am lost and you're soon gone

I don't want you to change
I love you just as you are
Don't go biting your nails
Those little fingers work too hard

Looks like it's a day for night
Shadows in the daylight
I was born to waste some time
And you're next in line

When you discover my name
When you discover my name
I'll tattoo it on your heart
Tattoo it on your heart

Don't be shy like you are
You don't want me to stay
I'm drinking Lite at the bar
A quiet guy in every way
Looks like it's a day for night
Shadows in the tail lights
I was born to waste some time
And you're next in line

When you discover my name
When you discover my name
I'll tattoo it on your heart
Tattoo it on your heart

As the pictures fly
Rushing by
Will the teardrops dry
On their eyes?

When you discover my name
When you discover my name

When you discover my name
I'll tattoo it on your heart
When you discover my name
I'll tattoo it on your heart
When you find out my name
I'll tattoo it on your heart
When you find out my name
I'll tattoo it on your heart

I'm no delinquent
I'm an artist
I'm a collector
Life into art
You are my next work
