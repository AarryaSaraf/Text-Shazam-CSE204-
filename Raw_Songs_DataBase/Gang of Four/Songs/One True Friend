Well I'm your one true friend
Ask of me anything
Ask of me what you want
I'll take you by the hand

We learn from what you know
Harvest the seeds you sow
Start your thought, I'll take it
Where it needs to go

You can be yourself with me
I can set you free
I know what you have been
Share what we believe
This too shall pass
Even if the memory lasts
All the pain is on a tab
In your name

You know I'll help you out
With anything
Run my fingers through your hair
We don't know who we are
The genie's left the jar
To what do you aspire?
I can help us get what we require

You can be yourself with me
I can set you free
I know what you have been
Share what we believe
This too shall pass
Even if the memory lasts
All the pain is on a tab
In your name

You can be yourself with me
I can set you free
I know what you have been
Share what we believe
This too shall pass
Even if the memory lasts
All the pain is on a tab
In your name
