Call for history, the past is dark
They make it up as they like
We put down a flag, we put down a line in the sand

I had no innocent mind
It's not hidden, it's there to find
They don't own the past, they say that the future glows

We double-lock the doors but these walls are paper thin
We await the next message to enter within
The future looked good but in space we spin
Everything was solid, but now it's all paper thin

You have an opinion
Confrontation, us and them
Just because you move your mouth don't mean a debate

We double-lock the doors but these walls are paper thin
Can't stop the endless messages pouring in
The clouds fill the sky and as the light dims
Moving so fast but everything is paper thin

We double-lock the doors but these walls are paper thin
We await the next message to enter within
The future looked good but in space we spin
Everything was solid, but now it's all paper thin

Everything is paper thin
