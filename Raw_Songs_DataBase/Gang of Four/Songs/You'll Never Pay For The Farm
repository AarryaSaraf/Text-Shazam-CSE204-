You'll never pay for the farm
Someone should raise the alarm
I think you're losing your charm
You can't undo all the harm

You can't regret what you get
You can't get back what you bet
You can't divorce from your fate
You're lying drunk at the wake

You never wanted to live alone
But never share what you don't own
Don't want to die upon your feet
You always want to keep the receipt

You think you're a winner
But you'll never pay, you'll never pay for the farm
You think you're a winner
Change the locks, change your life

You're never able to rest
You can't get thoughts off your chest
I think you lost the romance
You walk around in a trance

You got no 'cause to have regrets
You stuffed your face and then you wept
You're dreaming of World War the Third
Between the Shi-ites & the Kurds

You think you're a winner. Change the locks,
Change your life. You think you're a winner
But you'll never pay, you'll never pay for the farm

You think you're a winner. Change the locks, change your life
You think you're a winner. But you'll never pay for the farm

What you steal is crap
What you steal is crap
You should send it all back
Married your mother, buried your father
Hated your brother, locked up your sister
Change your life. No need for a sacrifice
