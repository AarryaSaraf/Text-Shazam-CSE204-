I'm a dissident; I say what we say is true
It's not, but we avow our sins
We saw it as the creed; I'm an alien hiding
Among the worker bees

The story's told
We'll be rats in a fight
I see in time
We are dead before we die

Well, they make the laws to keep control
But in the end, I'll join the line of dead souls

The shrink explains: I'm dysfunctional or ill
Just by some other name
I'm not cut out for this role
And in the end, I join the line of dead souls

Because those died without ever living
We only take what we are given

It was rushing by, everyone's on the run
And I pass the time in the line of dead souls

Well, they make the laws to keep control
But in the end, I'll join the line of dead souls
