The pilgrim can't sleep The pilgrim's a spy!
The pilgrim can't sleep 'cause his prayers won't fly
The dumb won't speak The truth is lies!
The dumb won't speak make their tongues get fired
The cripple won't walk The crooks all cry
The cripple won't walk put the stilts on trial
The dead man talks Didn't say goodbye
The dead man talks and the phone is wired

Who can steal when everything is free?
Who am I when everything is me?
Who am I when everything is me?
Who am I when everything is me?

Betting on tilt I make a deal
When I get up I take a pill
Come on down and come on in
The little lambs jump and I could kill them still

Creationists creep They walk in the street!
Creationists creep and the citizens buy
All the shoppers asleep They're in way too deep!
All the shoppers asleep and the cameras lie

Who can lie when everything is true?
Who wants old when everything is new

Who am I when everything is me?
Who am I when everything is me?

Betting on tilt I make a deal
When I get up I take a pill
Come on down and come on in
The little lambs jump and I could kill them still

Who am I when everything is me?
Who am I when everything is me?
Who am I when everything is me?

The little lambs jump and I could kill them still
