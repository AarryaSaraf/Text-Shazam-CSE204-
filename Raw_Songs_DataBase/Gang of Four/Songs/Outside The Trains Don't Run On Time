He's become nostalgic
Wants to own tomorrow
Discipline - is his passion
Now - he says there's none

Outside the trains don't run on time
He believes it's no coincidence
He thinks sunblock will track him down
Home - it's no castle
He wants his wife to run - and fetch
Order - he's obsessed with order order

Discipline - is his passion
Now - he says there's none
Order - his obsession
Order - his obsession
Now - he says there's none

Outside the trains don't run on time
He believes it's no coincidence
He thinks sunblock will track him down
Home - it's no castle
He wants his wife - to run - and fetch
Order
The trains don't run on time

Nostalgia
Discipline
Is his passion
Now - he says there's none

Outside the trains don't run on time
