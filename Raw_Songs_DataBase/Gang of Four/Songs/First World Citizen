She walked out of the station in flames
Crossed over the 38th parallel, hitched, made a ride to the west

Big appetites, those American guys
Chew up whatever the dollar buys

To be a first world citizen
To be a first world citizen

She will take up all your checks, no respect
I will work all the hours in the day
When they say "jump," they wanna hear "how high?"

I have lost everything
Didn't ask for anything
I would take anything, anything at all

To be a first world citizen
To be a first world citizen

I have lost everything
Didn't ask for anything
I would take anything, anything at all

To be a first world citizen
To be a first world citizen
To be a first world citizen
To be a first world citizen
