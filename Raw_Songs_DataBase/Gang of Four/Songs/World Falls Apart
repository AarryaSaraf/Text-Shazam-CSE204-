This sombitch nowhere's jewelled lights
Overflashing trade marks at war
"Hungry eat cake!" - "Thirsty Drink Cola!"
Piss stained boy slumps in a door

His hundred year old teenage eyes
Watch the lights chase green to red
Stuck to his head seed bun and fries
Waiting for the world to end

I'm gonna live right in your face
I'm gonna lie here while you play
Fuck you, yeah and fuck this place
Don't think you're chasing me away

Don't think you're better than I am
The music stops, your chair is gone
When they weigh the balance, man
You done no good and I done no wrong

I am the mess on your doorstep
You'll see me here until I die
Yeah, walk on by, look straight ahead
I'll be here till the whales can fly

The angel says: 'The gate's unlocked
But it ain't you must make amends
The rich guys try and beat the clock
Waiting for the sale to end -

Don't think they're better than you are
The music stops, their chair is gone
When they weigh the balance, man
They done no good and you done no wrong'

Yeah, I'm stopped in front of you
Waiting for the world to start
Yeah, I'm stuck at the front of the queue
Waiting till your world falls apart

My day begins when your party ends,
A booby trap in your bouquet
Dynamite in these happy times,
Valium for the mortgage rate
I'll cough in your face as the markets crash
I'll dog your steps from Pall Mall to The Strand
My time and place is real, yours incomplete
As we dream the future we make it wake

Yeah, I'm up at the front of the queue
And when you fall you'll fall just once
Yeah I'm up at the front of the queue
Waiting till your world falls apart
