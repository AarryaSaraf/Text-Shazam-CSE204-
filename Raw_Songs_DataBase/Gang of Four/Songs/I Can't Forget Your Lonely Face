You weren't around in the compound
Could not be found, had gone to ground
Hiding out in a public space, everyone was on display
I can't forget your lonely face

On your nights out, you danced alone
You loved the sights, the siren's moan
All the other losers dreaming of a break, everyone had been displaced
I can't forget your lonely face

Send me a picture of you on your escape
Send me a photo of you on holiday

I look at you, looking at me, can't come in here, with no ID
But when you're in you can have all you see,
Just got to reach up and pick from the tree

Just reach out pick fruit from the tree
Just reach out pick fruit from the tree

We are all broke, we celebrate
There's no punchline to jokes we make
We are not thin enough to fill in space, everything is in one place
I can't forget your lonely face

Send me a photo of you on holiday
Send me a photo of you on holiday

I look at you, you don't look like me, can't come in here, with no ID
But when you're in you can have all you see,
Just got to reach up and pick from the tree

Just reach out pick fruit from the tree
Just reach out pick fruit from the tree

Everything is in one place
Everything is in one place
