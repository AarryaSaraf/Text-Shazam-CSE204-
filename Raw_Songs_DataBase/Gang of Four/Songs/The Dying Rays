Stop the seconds flow
Oh, I'm too late
I'm back where I began at the start
I'm caught in the wake
I'll have my due and drag the rock up the hill
Nothing to lose that's not been lost
I wish the sun anchored still

What I wanted disappears in the haze
A speck of dust held forever in the dying rays

Breath on the mirror; nothing inside
The horizon's bare, but in the night, I miss the pilot's light

Control and power, empires were built in our minds
But it will all go up in a blaze; only dust in the dying rays
