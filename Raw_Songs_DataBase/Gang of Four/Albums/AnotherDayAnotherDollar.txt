// To Hell With Poverty //

In my arms we shall begin with none of the rocks well there's no charge
In this land right now, some are insane, and they're in charge
To hell with poverty we'll get drunk on cheap wine
To hell with poverty the check will arrive we'll turn the Boast again
To hell with poverty the check will arrive we'll turn to Boast again

In my arms we shall begin with none of the rocks and There's no charge
In this land right now, some are insane, and they're in charge
To hell with poverty we'll get drunk on cheap wine
To hell with poverty

// Capital (It Fails Us Now) //

The moment I was born
I opened my eyes
I reached out
For my credit card
Oh no, I left it in my other suit!

Capital, it fails us now
Comrade let us seize the time
(I left it in my other suit!)

On the first day of my life
I opened my eyes
Guess where?
With superstars
Surrounded by luxury goods

I need a freezer,
I need a hi-fi

No credit, no goods
Call my bank, I say
They say "we're bankrupt"

Capital, it fails us now
Come out, let us seize the time
Capital, it fails us now
Comrades, let us seize the time

Capital it fails us now
(I reached out, for my credit card)
Oh no! I left it in my other suit!

One day old and I'm living on credit
One day old and I'm living on credit
(I'm selling credit, just)
One day old and I'm living on credit

([unintelligle] at a superstore)

One day old and I'm living on credit

One day old and I'm living on credit

[unintelligible chant and response between Gill and King here]

// History's Bunk! //

What I'd like to hear desert people's history
Not the styles of strategic combat
We could lose our bent we hear about
They weren't the ones to get it in the neck
Fighting it out for some other's causes
They're invisible they didn't exist!
History's bunk our government
In the future will they make more junk?
What I'd like to hear tales of people's history
Fighting it out for some other's causes
They're invisible they didn't exist!
There are no lessons in the past [6x]

// Cheeseburger (Live) //

(I need a cheeseburger to go)

I move from one place to the next
I hope they keep down the price of gas
I shoot fast while you talk dollars
See how I will run the table
I won't see my dollar go where they rig it
High numbers low numbers 8 ball break

The last cent is coming out of his head
To be honest or a son like his own
And all this changed we're sure of the rides
The old country's in the back of his mind
I hope his home is somewhere you go to sleep
High numbers low numbers 8 ball break

No classes in the u s of a
Improve yourself the choice is yours
Work at your job you can make it pay
Make friends quick buy them beer
You never know when you're gonna lose them
High numbers low numbers 8 ball break

I'm at the wheel of the company truck
On the road and all alone
Sometimes I think money is my only goal
It makes me sad
Work on up another four miles
Coffee fries and a cheeseburger

// What We All Want (Live) //

This wheel spins letting me off
It's not the lack of trying
Can't put my finger on it

You can't help being hard up
Can't trust the gods we trusted
Don't think that's any insurance

Could I be happy with something else
I need something to fill my time
Could I be happy with someone else
I need someone to fill my time

This wheel spins letting me off
These doubts and nagging worries
Nothing to work towards

This demon on my back
Preaches the razors cut
The hope that does not fade

Could I be happy with something else
I need something to fill my time
Could I be happy with someone else
I need someone to fill my time

This wheel spins letting me off
It's not the lack of trying
Can't put my finger on it

You can't help being hard up
Can't trust the gods we trusted
Don't think that's any insurance

Could I be happy with something else
I need something to fill my time
Could I be happy with someone else
I need someone to fill my time

Could I be happy with something else
I need something to fill my time
Could I be happy with someone else
I need someone to fill my time

What we want's not what we get
