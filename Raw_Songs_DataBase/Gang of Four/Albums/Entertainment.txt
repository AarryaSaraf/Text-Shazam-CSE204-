Album: Entertainment

// Ether //

Trapped in heaven life style (Locked in Long Kesh)
You're looking out for pleasure (H-block torture)
It's at the end of the rainbow (White noise in)
The happy ever after (A white room)

Dirt behind the daydream
Dirt behind the daydream
The happy ever after
It's at the end of the rainbow

Dig at the root of the problem (Fly the flag on foreign soil)
It breaks your new dreams daily (H-block Long Kesh)
Father's contradictions (Censor six counties' news)
And breaks your new dreams daily (Each day more deaths)

Dirt behind the daydream
Dirt behind the daydream
The happy ever after
It's at the end of the rainbow

White noise in a white room
White noise in a white room
White noise in a white room
White noise in a white room

Trapped in heaven life style (Locked in Long Kesh)
Your looking out for pleasure (H-block torture)
It's at the end of the rainbow (White noise in)
The happy ever after (A white room)

Dirt behind the daydream
Dirt behind the daydream
The happy ever after
It's at the end of the rainbow

Dig at the root of the problem (Fly the flag on foreign soil)
It breaks your new dreams daily (H-block Long Kesh)
Father's contradictions (Censor six counties' news)
And breaks your new dreams daily (Each day more deaths)

Dirt behind the daydream
Dirt behind the daydream
The happy ever after
It's at the end of the rainbow

(There may be oil)
You're looking out for pleasure (Under Rockall)
It's at the end of the rainbow (There may be oil)
The happy ever after (under Rockall)
It's corked up with the ether (There may be oil)
It's corked up with the ether (under Rockall)
It's corked up with the ether (There may be oil)

// Natural's Not In It //

The problem of leisure
What to do for pleasure
Ideal love, a new purchase
A market of the senses

Dream of the perfect life
Economic circumstances
The body is good business
Sell out, maintain the interest

Remember Lot's wife
Renounce all sin and vice
Dream of the perfect life
This heaven gives me migraine

The problem of leisure
What to do for pleasure

Coercion of the senses
We are not so gullible
Our great expectations
A future for the good

Fornication makes you happy
No escape from society
Natural is not in it
Your relations are of power

We all have good intentions
But all with strings attached

Repackaged sex keeps your interest
Repackaged sex keeps your interest
Repackaged sex keeps your interest
Repackaged sex keeps your interest
Repackaged sex keeps your interest
Repackaged sex keeps your interest

The problem of leisure
What to do for pleasure
Ideal love, a new purchase
A market of the senses

Dream of the perfect life
Economic circumstances
The body is good business
Sell out, maintain the interest

Remember Lot's wife
Renounce all sin and vice
Dream of the perfect life
This heaven gives me migraine

This heaven gives me migraine
This heaven gives me migraine

// Not Great Men //

No weak men in the books at home
The strong men who have made the world
History lives on the books at home
The books at home

It's not made by great men
It's not made by great men
It's not made by great men
It's not made by great men

The past lives on in your front room
The poor still weak, the rich still rule
History lives in the books at home
The books at home

It's not made by great men
It's not made by great men
It's not made by great men
It's not made by great men

The past lives in the books at home
No weak men in the books at home
History lives in the books at home
The books at home

It's not made by great men
It's not made by great men
It's not made by great men
It's not made by great men

// Damaged Goods //

The change will do you good
I always knew it would
Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust

Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour
Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour

Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust
The sins of the flesh
Are simply sins of lust

Sweat's running down your back
Sweat's running down your neck
Heated couplings in the sun (Or is that untrue?)
Colder couplings in the night (Never saw your body)

Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour
Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust

The change will do you good
I always knew it would
You know the change will do you good
You know the change will do you good

Damaged goods, send 'em back
I can't work, I can't achieve, send me back
Open the till, give me the change you said would do me good
Refund the cost, you said you're cheap but you're so smart

Your sweat so sour
Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust

The change will do you good
I always knew it would
You know the change will do you good
You know the change will do you good

I'm kissing you goodbye
I'm kissing you goodbye
I'm kissing you goodbye
I'm kissing you goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

// Guns Before Butter //

All this talk of blood and iron
Is the 'cause of all my shaking
All this talk of blood and iron
Is the 'cause of all my shaking
All this talk of blood and iron
Is the 'cause of all my shaking

All this talk about blood and iron
It's the 'cause of all my shaking
The fatherland's no place to die for
It makes me want to run out shaking

I hear some talk of guns and butter
That's something we can do without
If men are only blood and iron
O Doctor Doctor, what's in my shirt?

Just keep quiet, no room for doubt

I'm hearing talk of joy in labour
I'll tell you this, you can leave me out
The motherland's no place to cry for
I want some sand to hide my head in

I'm hearing talk of strength in labour
That's something I can do without
If I'm only blood and iron
O Doctor Doctor, what's in my shirt?

Just keep quiet, no room for doubt

All this talk of blood and iron
It's the 'cause of all my shaking
The fatherland's no place to cry for
It makes me want to run out shouting

I hear some talk of guns and butter
That's something I can do without
If men are only blood and iron
O Doctor Doctor, what's in my shirt?

Just keep quiet, no room for doubt

// I Found That Essence Rare //

Aim for the body rare, you'll see it on TV
The worst thing in 1954 was the bikini
See the girl on the TV dressed in a bikini
She doesn't think so, but she's dressed for the H-bomb
(For the H-bomb)

I found that essence rare, it's what I looked for
I knew I'd get what I asked for

Aim for the country fair, you read it in the paper
The worst thing happens any week, a scandal on the front page
You see the happy pair smiling close like they are monkeys
They wouldn't think so, but they're holding themselves down
(Hold themselves down)

I found that essence rare, it's what I looked for
I knew I'd get what I asked for

I found that essence rare, it's what I looked for
I knew I'd get what I asked for

Aim for politicians fair who'll treat your vote hope well
The last thing they'll ever do, act in your interest
Look at the world through your polaroid glasses
Things'll look a whole lot better for the working classes
(Working classes)

I found that essence rare, it's what I looked for
I knew I'd get what I asked for

I found that essence rare, it's what I looked for
I knew I'd get what I asked for

// Glass //

Look through the window
Look through the window
Look through the window
I'm looking through a pane of glass

Look through the window and what do you see?
Look through the window and what do you see?
Look through the window and what do you see?
I'm looking through a pane of glass

I'm so restless
I'm so restless
I'm so restless
We talk about this and we talk about that

I'm so restless, I'm bored as a cat
I'm so restless, I'm bored as a cat
I'm so restless, I'm bored as a cat
We talk about this and we talk about that

Light myself
Light myself
Light myself
Nicotine really goes to my head

Light myself up a cigarette
Light myself up a cigarette
Light myself up a cigarette
Nicotine really goes to my head

If you're feeling all in take some asprin
If you feel in a mess put your head on a head rest
Your back on a back rest, foot on a foot rest
Or your arm on an arm rest or your leg on a leg rest

Your back on a back rest, if you feel in a real mess
When you're feeling all in
Take some asprin
Or some paracetamol

Always thought life should be so easy
It seems that I have misunderstood
Nothing I do can seem to please me
What I say don't sound so good

I always thought
I always thought
I always thought
It seems that I have misunderstood

// Contract //

The same again, another disagreement
You dreamed of scenes like you read of in magazines
A new romance, invented in the bedroom
Is this so private, our struggle in the bedroom?

Is this really the way it is?
Or a contract in our mutual interest?

The same again, another disappointment
We couldn't perform in the way the other wanted
These social dreams put in practise in the bedroom
Is this so private, our struggle in the bedroom?

Is this really the way it is?
Or a contract in our mutual interest?

Our bodies make us worry
Our bodies make us worry
Our bodies make us worry
Our bodies make us worry

Is this really the way it is?
Or a contract in our mutual interest?
Is this really the way it is?
Or a contract in our mutual interest?

// At Home He's A Tourist //

At home he feels like a tourist
At home he feels like a tourist
He fills his head with culture
He gives himself an ulcer
He fills his head with culture
He gives himself an ulcer

Down on the disco floor
They make their profit
From the things they sell
To help you cover
All the rubbers you hide
In your top left pocket

At home she's looking for interest
At home she's looking for interest
She said she was ambitious
So she accepts the process
She said she was ambitious
So she accepts the process

Down on the disco floor
They make their profit
From the things they sell
To help you cob off
And the rubbers you hide
In your top left pocket

Two steps forward
(Six steps back)
(Six steps back)
(Six steps back)
(Six steps back)
Small step for him
(Big jump for me)
(Big jump for me)
(Big jump for me)
(Big jump for me)

At home she feels like a tourist
At home she feels like a tourist
She fills her head with culture
She gives herself an ulcer
Why make yourself so anxious
You give yourself an ulcer

// 5.45 //

How can I sit and eat my tea
With all that blood flowing from the television
At a quarter to six, I watch the news
Eating, eating all my food
As I sit watching the red spot
In the egg which looks like
All the blood you don't see on the television.

Still body now, no movement yet
Five men lie die flat on their backs
Were they born to lie in state
Defend the ever stagnate great?

Down on the street assassinate
All of them look so desperate
Declared blood war on the bourgeois state

Watch new blood on the 18 inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Ionic charge gives immortality
The corpse is a new personality

Down on the street assassinate
All of them look so desperate

Declared blood war on the bourgeois state

Watch new blood on the 18 inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Watch new blood on the 18 inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Watch new blood on the 18 inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Watch new blood on the 18 inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Watch new blood on the 18 inch screen
The corpse is a new personality

Guerilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerilla war struggle is a new entertainment
Guerilla war struggle is a new entertainment

Down on the street assassinate
All of them look so desperate
Declared blood war on the bourgeois state

// Anthrax //

Woke up this morning desperation a. m
What I've been saying won't say them again
My head's not empty, it's full with my brain
The thoughts I'm thinking
Like piss down a drain

And I feel like a beetle on its back
And there's no way for me to get up
Love'll get you like a case of anthrax
And that's something I don't want to catch

Ought to control what I do to my mind
Nothing in there but sunshades for the blind
Only yesterday I said to myself
The things I'm doing are not good
For my health

"Love crops up quite a lot as something to sing about
Cos most groups make most of their songs about falling in love
Or how happy they are to be in love
You occasionally wonder why these groups do sing about it all the time -
It's because these groups think there's something very special about it
Either that or else it's because everybody else sings about it and always has
You know to burst into song you have to be inspired
And nothing inspires quite like love

These groups and singers think that they appeal to everyone
By singing about love because apparently everyone has or can love
Or so they would have you believe anyway
But these groups seem to go along with what, the belief
That love is deep in everyone's personality
I don't think we're saying there's anything wrong with love
We just don't think that what goes on between two people
Should be shrouded with mystery."

Love'll get you like a case of anthrax
And that's something I don't want to catch
Love'll get you like a case of anthrax
And that's something I don't want to catch
