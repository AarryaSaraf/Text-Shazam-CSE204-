Album: Shrinkwrapped

// Tattoo //

(Can't make out what he is saying)
Like you
Like you

You don't know who I am
You don't know where I come from
From the soul of this land
I am lost and you're soon gone

I don't want you to change
I love you just as you are
Don't go biting your nails
Those little fingers work too hard

Looks like it's a day for night
Shadows in the daylight
I was born to waste some time
And you're next in line

When you discover my name
When you discover my name
I'll tattoo it on your heart
Tattoo it on your heart

Don't be shy like you are
You don't want me to stay
I'm drinking Lite at the bar
A quiet guy in every way
Looks like it's a day for night
Shadows in the tail lights
I was born to waste some time
And you're next in line

When you discover my name
When you discover my name
I'll tattoo it on your heart
Tattoo it on your heart

As the pictures fly
Rushing by
Will the teardrops dry
On their eyes?

When you discover my name
When you discover my name

When you discover my name
I'll tattoo it on your heart
When you discover my name
I'll tattoo it on your heart
When you find out my name
I'll tattoo it on your heart
When you find out my name
I'll tattoo it on your heart

I'm no delinquent
I'm an artist
I'm a collector
Life into art
You are my next work

// Sleepwalker //

I'm an understudy for myself
I'm on standby waiting at the gate
I'm a window shopper staring at an empty shelf
I'm sleepwalking while I'm awake

I'm a phoney guest drinking at a wake
I'm a milktooth werewolf in the lambing barn
I'm a sucker swallowing the bait
I'm a claustrophobic in a caravan

I'm sleepwalking while I'm awake
I'm sleepwalking while I'm awake

I'm a moon shift cleaner burning in the sun
I'm a man's man but I can't cut the cord
I'm nobody but I'm not no one
I only want what I can't afford
I'm sleepwalking while I'm awake

I'm sleepwalking while I'm awake

I'm sleepwalking while I'm awake
I'm sleepwalking while I'm awake

// I Parade Myself //

Look at me, ain't I fine
Brand new me, dig my mine
I parade myself

One on one, I am nouveau
Here I come, there I go
I parade myself

Catch my eyes, aren't we a pair
I'm not shy, touch me there
I parade myself

I win
When
I invent myself again
I parade myself
I win
When
I make myself again
I parade myself

Ain't I ripe, what a peach
Everything is in my reach
I parade myself

Now I accuse, face to face
The one to lose this one man race
I parade myself

I win
When
I invent myself again
I parade myself

I am civilized
I live wall to wall
But I ain't shy
Don't avoid my eyes
Hid some razor blades
In the wedding cake
I walk on by
Singing bye, bye, bye

I parade
I parade myself
Bye, bye, bye
I parade

// Unburden //

Hi baby, what do you want to talk about?

I'm here, right here
Behind me the road, in front, a grey wall
There is no background, no story to tell, no point
The search is over

I bet you're naked, I know what you're doing

Don't imagine I'm honest
I dress up everything I say as integrity
And they believe me
God, whose name I so often invoke
God, is silent: and I babble.

Honey, is there something you want me to say?
Do you wanna know what I'm doing?
I'm pulling my dress off. That's better.
Now I'm picking up my cigarette.

I can see you. I can see the brush caressing your hair
And the cigarette hanging from your pretty hands.
I smell your perfume.
We could be as one.
You are my chance, I know you.

Are you ready baby,
Are you going to do it for me now?

We're alone and on fire
The years spin backwards, forgotten, to a blank horizon
But here the lines cross.
At this point, nothing

// Better Him Than Me //

He drives all week
Where does he go?
Only down one way streets
He does not know

The car's not his
Car's not his
What does he care?
Does he care?
Goes A to Zed
A to Zed
And back from there
And back from there

Parks in a mall
Hears taped birds call
They built these walls
A palace for us all
They built these walls
A palace for us all
A palace for us all
A palace for us all

Sits fountain side
To ease his mind
The passers by
Avoid his eyes

He always says
Always says
You got your health
Got your health
Shit happens, yeah
Happens, yeah
Just be yourself
Just be yourself

Delayed when he
Slowed down to see
Crash casualty
Better him than me

Crash casualty
Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me

Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me

Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me

He listens to
Talk radio
Strangers who
Break down on the phone

Strangers who
Break down on the phone
Down on the phone
Down on the phone

Delayed when he
Slowed down to see
Crash casualty
Better him than me

Crash casualty
Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me

Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me

Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me
Better him than me

// Something 99 //

I volunteer to serve myself
Words, comma, sentence, end.
Addicted to sentiment
Hopes, postponed sleepless, end.
Necrophiliac desires
Cock culture, I defend
Overdose nostalgic rides
Pause, scarequotes, fullstop.

Fuel stop, steak, wipe its arse
Something 99
Someone's got what should be mine
Something 99

I'm a consumer of myself
Reminiscence, and self love, end.
Memories I never had
Dash, semi colon

Fuel stop, steak, wipe its arse
Something 99
12 inch Jesus on the dash
Something 99

Someone's got what should be mine
Something 99
(Unintelligible)..all I can find
Something 99

Fuel stop, steak, wipe its arse
Something 99
Someone's got what should be mine
Something 99

Fuel stop, steak, wipe its arse
Something 99
Someone's got what should be mine
Something 99

// Showtime, Valentine //

HOTEL flash, shadows mash grey and black to white
40 watt bulb has shot out it's last light
Sirens uncoil the sound of the nighttime
Got no smoke and drunk the wine

Cable's on Porno 1 - sound off - lips are red
Silent stud pumping between her legs
Through the wall a talkshow's bleeding into my brain
People laugh at what they are saying

Showtime, Valentine

Not the face - waste of space - freezeframe
Fucking, see -
On command in her hand seed spills free
I am remote, in control behind my eyes
Zap the screen and the picture dies

I got to feel, have to steal something real instead
Got no power, every hour gold turns to lead
I can hear a roach that's scratching under my bed
I rule the world and crush it dead

Showtime, Valentine

I found my distance
Locked out the other
Shat on your doorstep
The unknown soldier
I'm a showtime, valentine
This is showtime, valentine
I will not walk
Don't need the day
I am the sun king of all I survey

Now it's showtime, every day
Now it's showtime, every day

// Unburden Unbound //

He's so alienated he doesn't even understand
That, that what he's asking for is what he already knows
He would expect to masturbate

She's very two dimensional, you know, deliberately so
I mean she, in the interchange, she has no personality

She could be a tape recording

He knows she's real to the extent one knows anybody
Is real. You can't get away from that

She, who's the victim? Is he the victim?

// The Dark Ride //

I wore out time
Used up all that should be mine
Shit faced, watch soaps
I only laugh at my own jokes

Gunfingered, I pop
Competitors on gameshow spots
Lucked out, she wins
A home to fake orgasms in

Sirens they call to me
"Come on the dark ride"
Sirens they call me
In from the outside

The dark ride, the dark ride
Sirens call me on the dark ride

Idle, I pray
Wish me on a holiday
No sweat, I kneel
Faking hope until it's real

I drowned the years
In a honeymooner's tears
Stranger, here's the proof
That's me in the photo booth

Sirens they call to me
"Come on the dark ride"
Sirens they call me
In from the outside

The dark ride, the dark ride
Sirens call me on the dark ride

The dark ride, the dark ride
Sirens call me on the dark ride

(Unintelligible)
I'll make your bad times disappear
Don't need a shrink, I got no fear

I'll make your bad times disappear
Don't need a shrink, I got no fear
Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear

The dark ride, the dark ride
Sirens call me

The dark ride, the dark ride
Sirens call me, sirens call me

The dark ride, the dark ride
Sirens call me, sirens call me

The dark ride, the dark ride
Sirens call me on the dark ride

// I Absolve You //

Now, confess
Face your fears
I'm tuned in for
Your drivetime tears

Don't hold back
Share your shame
Feel the pain
You're not to blame

I forcefeed on the ruins of childhood
And lovers crimes
This showtrial
Come on down victim mic

Don't hold back
Share your shame
Feel the pain
You're not to blame

If I could
I'd let you cry on my shoulders
I've no friends either
Lonely, I absolve you

Now, confess
You're not to blame
Now, confess
You're not to blame
Not to blame

// Shrinkwrapped //

I don't walk, I always take the car
Tune to talkshow talk about the stars
I don't speak, I got nothing to say
I'm a Capricorn anyway

I don't act, I react
Live as if, then I will be
Shrinkwrapped
I'm Shrinkwrapped

Fate's barcoded in my DNA
I've been living someone else's day
Doppleganger is my nemesis
Stole my luck and made my planets miss

I don't act, I react
Live as if, then I will be
Shrinkwrapped
I'm Shrinkwrapped

I, I don't need, I don't need to see
I could catch a green and drive blind
I could catch a green
Everything's the same, called by different names
I don't decide, I just do
Roll loaded dice, cross my fingers and trust

I hold my breath
I am turning blue
I hold my breath
I am turning blue

I don't act, I react
Live as if, then I will be
Shrinkwrapped
I'm Shrinkwrapped
I'm Shrinkwrapped
I'm Shrinkwrapped
