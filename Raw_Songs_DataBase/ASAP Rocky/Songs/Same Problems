Niggas dyin' every other night
Niggas cryin' that's a part of life
Lyin' to my face tryin' to say
That it's all good, no nuttin' right

Put your five fingers high to the sky
On the stand, put it on your life
Stand by, nigga, wrong right
Not new to drama, nigga, all my life
Not new to trauma, nigga, all my life
Been duckin' karma, nigga, all my life

How many problems get solved?
Am I a product of things that I saw?
How many problems get solved?
Am I a product of things in my songs?
How many problems get solved?
Am I a product of all of my flaws?
How many problems get solved?
If we don't get involved

Don't bite that hand that feed you
I don't hear or see no evil
Dilated like my pupils
Mean I already peeped you
Annihilate on my people
Violated
Till we tower like were skyscrapers
Jumpin' off the porch or fire escape
We ain't even tryin' to break it
All black like we tryin' to break it
This that crack all 'em Ronald Regan
ASAP mode, I'm tired of waitin'
Let's get it

How many problems get solved?
Am I a product of things that I saw?
How many problems get solved?
Am I a product of things in my songs?
How many problems get solved?
Am I a product of all of my flaws?
How many problems get solved?
If we don't get involved

Silent night, holy night
All is fine, try to duck and dive
Remember ways, that's a way of life
Remember comin' back, say, "Turn on the lights"
Just settle down, shawty, I'm sellin' white
Niggas cryin' and it's just the other night (Shit don't)
Mommas cryin', it's a part of life (Shit)
Momma sayin' I'm a satellite (Ooh, shit don't)
Jumpin' off the Porsche, I ain't 'fraid of heights
I won't drop the bag even when I'm breakin' nice
Breakin' bad, I was breakin' night, Kid Cudi, "Day 'N Nite"

Goin' up, I'm goin' down
Goin' up, I'm goin' down
Goin' up, I'm goin' down
Goin' up, I'm goin' down

Goin' down, goin' down
Goin' down, goin' down
