Came up out the mud, brushed the dirt up off me
Goin' hard, hit 'em where it hurts, kill 'em softly
Bummed, stressed, tryna clear my mind, even smoke less
Hopelessness, but I'm in this shit full fledged
Talk reckless, comin' for your neck, no strep throat
Runnin'-runnin'-runnin' this shit, both legs, bro
Word around town, that they comin' for my head though
Funny thing about it, they don't know what's in my head though
Schizo', maniac like I'm finna go clepto'
So hands-on, kinda hard for me to let go (Let go)
Stackin' presidents like a Lego
Would introduce you to my friends, but they dead though
(Came up out the mud, brushed the dirt up off me)


Ayo, run it, run it, run it, I'ma take it like a clepto'
Anybody want it, they can get it, come correct though
Talk behind my back, but when they see me, it's respect though
Still got the crown, so I never give a 'F' though
Everything is wavy, I'ma hit 'em with the brush stroke
Then I'ma get high, I'ma get the best dope
Yeah I make the rules, I ain't following a dress code
I don't do the mess though, I'ma put a hex though
I ain't with the hugs and kisses, don't do the 'x-o'
Soon as the bell go ding though, I'll be in the ring though
We could shoot cinco
Look at all these clowns, how they studying my lingo
Peekin' out the window, but they'll never win though

I'ma flex, yes, I'm the best, I'm a veteran
In the Lex, yes, big baguettes in my necklace
In his head, neck, and his chest, he gon' catch a fist
I go deck, deck, break his leg, do it effortless
In the ring, ain't no fuckin' game, ain't no Tetris
Hit him, bang, I'ma shake his brain, I'm gon' never miss
Man, I'm amped, I'm the fuckin' champ, I can't fail at this
Money dance, 'bout a million bands, I got hella grip
Hella chips, with a lot of chicks, coming by the clique
Mo' sex with the Rolex, come without a tick
Mo' grip when the dough flip, give me no lip
Whole fist, break his whole shit, take it, lil' bitch
Gettin' fit, have him win a 'ship , watch him catch a fit
