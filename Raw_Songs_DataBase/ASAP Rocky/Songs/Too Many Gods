Tell me why we go to war, too many gods
Tell me what we praying for, too many gods
Feel like things will never change, I swear to God
Sometimes I wonder if God ever prays for me (Ooh)
Tell me why we go to war, too many gods (Ooh)
Tell me what we praying for, too many gods (Ooh)
Feel like things will never change, I swear to God (Ooh)
Sometimes I wonder if God ever prays for me (Ooh)


It's just too many laws
Misfits, too many wars
Battle scars, too many swords

Knight in shining armor, such a pretty horse
Strange screams down the corridors
Divide, conquer, call it yours
Another false prophet's on the thrones
(Who holds the north?) Had a dream

I woke up a king in a peasant body

Killed my pride, I felt less embodied
Still inside, writing papers
Flying ravens with a message 'bout me
On my knees like I'm rectifying
Hand on my heart like I'm testifying
Want the beef, I go prime on it
Fuck a king, I turn God on it


Tell me why we go to war, too many gods
Tell me what we praying for, too many gods
Feel like things will never change, I swear to God
Sometimes I wonder if God ever prays for me (Ooh)
Tell me why we go to war, too many gods (Ooh)
Tell me what we praying for, too many gods (Ooh)
Feel like things will never change, I swear to God (Ooh)
Sometimes I wonder if God ever prays for me (Ooh)

Uh, head start
Sword so sharp, take his head apart (Hmm, hmm, ayy)
Ready for war, I grew up with soldiers like Ned Stark (Yeah)

Dragging my name in the dirt and I'll bury 'em
Playing with fire but I'm no Targaryen

Dire wolves with me, these ain't no Siberians
What's a king to a God? Ain't no comparing them

Bent the flow harder, Valyrian steel

Nobody move or somebody get killed
I got the pole, aim my scope at his head
Look in his eyes and he knew he was dead
This ain't no Dunleavey but he be said
I pray to God, but who pray for the kid?
Life is too short to be living in fear
Especially when you know winter is here
