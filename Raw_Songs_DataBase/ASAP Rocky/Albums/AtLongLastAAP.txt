// Holy Ghost //

Ay, I have a message from the Most High that says:
"This negra kept his soul from the Devil."
It's true, I guess I mean, wait a minute now
Is your people really that God damn ign'ant? Really? Really?

Church bells and choir sounds, tell 'em, "Quiet down"
Bow your head, the Most High's around cocktails
Guys and gals miss me, ties and gowns happen now
My entire sound is how you tryna sound? Stop it now

They ask me why I don't go to church no more
'Cause church is the new club and wine is the new bub
And lies is the new drugs, my sister the next stripper
My brother the next victim, my usher the next tricker

Satan givin' out deals, finna own these rappers
The game is full of slaves and they mostly rappers
You sold your soul first, then your homies after
Let's show these stupid field niggas they could own they masters
Holy smokes, I think my pastor was the only folk
To own the Rollie, Ghost and Rolls Royces with no Holy Ghost
And get your shit prepared, face your fears, all you niggas scared
Say your prayers, pray you fit upstairs, it's our only hope

Church bells and choir sounds, tell 'em, "Quiet down"
Bow your head, the Most High's around, Lord

(These things are not right, these things is not right) Lord
(Hell, nobody's ever defined) Lord

The pastor had a thing for designer glasses
Yeah, I'm talkin' fancy plates and diamond glasses
The ushers keep skimmin' the collection baskets
And they tryna dine us with some damn wine and crackers

Who's more important than your Lord and Savior?

Won't let the pearly gates up in this
Probably due to all your poor behavior

My mental got a couple tips to save ya
Just be sure to count it as my only favor, thank me later
Uh, every night I stayed up sayin' prayer, made me greater, uh
Let's savior chasin' green for collard greens and baked potatoes
On the table, pray for cable, hit the label, now we major
Ha, I got my own relationship with God, Lord

Holy Ghost, I'm on my knees, I'm on my knees
Holy Ghost, you're all I need, you're all I need
Holy Ghost, I'm on my knees, I'm on my knees
Holy Ghost, you're all I need, you're all I need
Holy Ghost, I'm on my knees, I'm on my knees

[A$AP Rocky:]
Yeah, live through the strugglin', life's a every day (hustle)
I hustle every day in life, thinkin' back
Takin' packs up the block, them older niggas said I couldn't (hustle)
Man fuck 'em niggas, I'll be back, strapped backpack
Bitch, I'm flippin' work, hand in hand, I think they call it track (hustle)
Racin' laps, re-up went to waste, it pays to make it stack
Face the fact, there's always niggas out there, tryin' to knock the (hustle)
I guess that's why they say we trap, don't let niggas hold you back
I'm just a kettle from the ghetto with no pot to piss in
So who am I to call it black? Black man, black male
Black ball, black opsy, black diamonds glistenin'
Attract the pigs and all the rats, kitten scratch
I went from roaches on my bump to red brooches on the cuff
Of my tux, chauffeur pullin' up, no if, and's or buts about him
I went to Paris for my trunks, 100 thousand spent on Goyard
Used 'em once, couldn't give a shit, damn or fuck about 'em
Hit Canal Street, vintage gold medallion
Smokin' blunts in front of public housin'
Wildin' 'til they throw me in them cuffs
Mouth full of fronts, look like Master P up in my Cartiers
Diamonds shinin' in the frames
Changed the game and made them say (uhh)
Ain't no limits to this shit, life's a flick, you're stickin' to the script
My life is like a movie, they should film me through it
Take a pic, be sure to frame the shit, forever me, was always G
Way before this famous shit, y'all just pretend to do it

[Bones:]
You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah
You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah

[A$AP Rocky:]
Rap game like the crack game, swear it's all the same (hustle)
Whippin' soda through the pot, watch it bubble
Flexin' muscle, hit the block, I bet I teach you niggas how to (hustle)
Sellin' coca on the charts, watch it double
Uh, takin' meetings on my bus, this shit my mobile office
Gettin' head while at my desk, this shit my oval office
I remember when I got a hundred for recordings
Now the sum of my performances just put me on the Forbes list
Fuck jiggy, I'm flawless, fuck pretty, I'm gorgeous
Your favourite rappers' corpses couldn't measure my importance
My mind is out in orbits, plus my ego got endorsements
Heard the people want that raw shit, but y'all be talkin' bullshit

[Bones:]
You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah
You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah

// Fine Whine //

[Joe Fox:]
This love, this love, this love won't last forever
This love, this love, this love gon' own our eyes
This love, this love, this love won't last forever
And this love, and this love, and this love gon' own our

[A$AP Rocky:]
I think my cup is getting muddy, oh buddy
Is this that punch, drunk, and love it, no buggy?

Eyes bloody when we out in public
I'm hubby, she say she love me
Wasted money on syrup and honey, she think she Duffy

Then I became a druggy, enhanced my fame and money
And for your pain and suffering, my karma's waiting for me
Expecting payments from me
But she won't get a damn thing from me

She just might get a band-aid from me
You swear the Benz and these bands ain't from me

[A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox:]
I know I'm a scumbag and now your heart broke
The night is still young, for you to sip and whine
(Slow, slow, slow) Lemme see you whine
(Slow, slow, slow, oh yeah)
I know your heart is broken, pick up your wine glass
With your fine ass, before you whine fast whine slow
(Slow, slow, slow) Lemme see you whine
(Slow, slow, slow, oh yeah)

[Joe Fox:]
This love, this love, this love won't last forever
This love, this love, this love gon' own our eyes

[M.I.A.:]
How the fuck am I supposed to live?
How many fucks am I supposed to give?
How the fuck am I supposed to feel?
Treated like a bill, cut the check and split
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick
Tell your new bitch she can suck a dick

[Future:]
You the one that was putting up with me
You see how these streets corrupted me
I gotta conquer everything in front of me
Even though I broke your heart, how can you turn on me?
We with the shits on the real
I do this shit on the real, I like them drinks on the real
I fuck your bitch on the real
We do this shit on the real, keep it real on the real
I was just keeping it G,
 she don't spend money at first
Say you're in love with me, but I know it never gon' work
I come through, top back, hangin' out the Vert
Eyes screwed up, I'm drinkin' syrup

I know that look that you givin' me
It's killing you softly mentally

[A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox:]
I know I'm a scumbag and now your heart broke
The night is still young, for you to sip and whine
(Slow, slow, slow) Lemme see you whine
(Slow, slow, slow, oh yeah)
I know your heart is broken, pick up your wine glass
With your fine ass, before you whine fast whine slow
(Slow, slow, slow) Lemme see you whine
(Slow, slow, slow, oh yeah)

// L$D //

I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams

It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, "I really wanna let it go"

I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold, oh

Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

It started in Hollywood
Duh, duh-duh
Dreamin' of sharin' love
Duh, duh-duh
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all

I look for ways to say, "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD

// Excuse Me //

For all them hoes that was frontin' on niggas back in the days, man

Cause I gave this shit my all, ain't got nothing left to lose

Tell me why these little niggas talking like they killas, bruh
Nowadays these niggas always caught up in they feelings, bruh
But I stay 100 cause you know I keep it trilla, bruh

Mobbin like 2Pacalypse or Bishop how I Hit 'Em Up

Fill 'em up with lyrics, bury all my victims, kill 'em
Dig 'em up again, to say I did it
Snitch, excuse me, mind your business, bruh

Swear that you could get it, girl

[A$AP Rocky:]

- Well I got, I got, James, Jimmy or Byron Dean
- Yeah, I've been feeling that really JD swag lately man

[A$AP Rocky & (A$AP Ferg):]
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye stepped up in this piece
Bust my Glock to ensure that all you niggas rest in peace (Alright!)
Uh, Schwarzenegger I, straight slaughter niggas

I'm offin' niggas, screaming off with niggas' heads
They all surrender, better call for niggas
Come at all you niggas heads, talk 'em off a ledge
I'm arguing with 'em, I'm done talking with 'em
I order coffins for 'em, call the coroner for 'em
Get a comforter for 'em, I did all you niggas' beds
I want all you niggas dead (Yeah!)

You want oil nigga money, royalness, and bread
Royalties instead of rollies for your boys, but loyalty is dead (Grrr! Yeah!)

[A$AP Rocky:]
Now I'm only up again
Kick... kick a man while he's down
Looks dead; can't be safe to say it

Everybody's getting punished
Looking down to sell with you, how have you been?
Probably an undercover, had them undercovers with you
People buying and selling for you
I'll only sell with you if you're blind to sell

[A$AP Rocky & (A$AP Ferg):]
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye stepped up in this piece (Booyah!)
Bust my Glock to ensure that all you niggas rest in peace (Bop, bop, bop, alright)
Rep my block, quick to draw on all you niggas if there's beef (That's right, booyah!)

Blow your spot, better pray to Lord this shit don't hit the streets

Jimmy Dean

(Alright!)

// Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye 2 //

Who the jiggy nigga with the gold links?
Got me reminiscin' 'bout my old day
Three 6, suck a nigga dick, no foreplay, all day

Boomin' out the trap through the hallway
Tell me what you niggas know about it
Auntie sayin' turn it down, or she finna call the cops
We be plottin' on the ops, she the one who got the drop
Just a free quick fix of the A, and it's okay
They gon' take me back to my old ways
I was tryna chill, poppin' seals ever since I got a deal

Kick it with my model chick, sip Cris, fuck niggas wanna diss
Now I gotta let 'em know who's really trill

Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye
Tell these fuck niggas how you been

You been crossin' our minds, niggas talk down every now and then
On the side, who gave em style 9 times out of 10?
It was Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye
Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye

I ain't never lookin' for no handouts
Broke ass niggas never helpin' with they hands out

Find out where the fuck nigga live then we camp out
Screamin' fuck the world, never catch me with my pants down

Always been a stand-up guy, I'd rather stand out
Raf Simons, Stan Smith edition with my bands out

I'm the trillest one to do it since Pimp, nigga hands down
If a nigga put his hands on me, that's a man down
Trick, what? Pimps up, hoes down, whoa now

Slow down, see they runnin' with my old style
Grow foul, gold smile, you ho now, thuggin' with my old style
It's a shame how they low down
Dirty like Adidas on my sneaker feature, uh
Trappin' through the speaker, peep the beeper ringer, uh
Turnin' off phones, just to reach 'em, gotta beep 'em
I'm a Lord motherfucker, better greet him if you see him

Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye
Tell these fuck niggas how you been

You been crossin' our minds, niggas talk down every now and then
On the side, who gave em style 9 times out of 10?
It was Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye

Shake that ass girl, make that coochie wet (Ow-ow-ow)

[ScHoolboy Q:]
Yeah, ever seen a crib like this?
Diamonds in my ear like wrists

Pull off at the light like, "Wuh"
Lookin' like a mil' in that trunk

Two-seater got me lookin' all clumped
Hit a nigga wig on sight (Sight)
Serve a nigga mom off white (White)
I'ma get her so high, I'm Christ
Nigga, ball so hard like Mike
I could whip that bitch like Ike
I can fuck your bitch off hype
Pink ring, got bling all bright
How a hot nigga rock this ice?

14, almost got that strike
14, almost did that time

Clip small, but the shit shoot fine
Shoot a spine, make a nigga recline

Start sparkin', a nigga go blind

// Jukebox Joints //

[Part I]

[A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox:]
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up
But where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know

[A$AP Rocky:]
She the type to seek love and make it everlasting
I'm the type to wake up and say you never happened
I mean, I fucked the girl with hella passion
But it's cold how we smashing, left her sleeping on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice

Good excuse for my absence like, "Flacko, where your ass been?
Heard you done with fashion, now yo' ass is acting"

I'm tripping off the acid, now yo' ass is looking massive

This ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
Rolling spliffs, clique beside me, fingers Liberace

When I seen this bitch in vintage Tommy and some mid Huaraches

I'm all alone though, mood music makes me bop slower

Trippin' on how I shifted pop culture, changed hip-hop on ya
Smoking like a rasta was my pop's culture
I be damned if I die sober, I'll be sure to visit Pac for ya

[A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox:]
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up
But where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know

[A$AP Rocky:]
And shout outs my pretty womens in the spot tonight
Let me see them fuckin' hands
And for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps
Lex, coupes and the Bimmers and the Benz, come again

When my death calls, I pray the Lord accept collect calls
'Cause I be playing with these womens like they sex dolls

Call my Prada prior, cause it's dropping next fall
Don't you short the next ball, my closet like the Met ball
She said, "I just love it when you speak soft-spoken
Up in the magazines with your teeth all golden"
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Dropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'
That touch your soul music, I get you higher
Grab your lighter fluid, might add a preacher and a choir to it
I speak the father's music, hallelujah
Always Strive & Prosper, stupid

Even Montell can't tell you how we do it
Sit back and watch me do it

[A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox:]
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up
But where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know

[Part II]

[A$AP Rocky:]
Okay, let's get past all the swag trapping and fashion talking
You want that take it to gats or keep it in rapping talking
They rap impulsive, get embarrassed, it actually happens often
You my son like my last abortion, I'm just laughing off it
I changed rap, pushed fashion forward, yeah, I'm that important
You jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both acting awkward?
Jiggling baby, nah, go ahead, bitch

Ain't nothing better than the pretty big forehead bitch

Listen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familiar
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia
Did Azalea's from Australia, trips to Venezuela
Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather
Ella, ella, ayy, just play it like I didn't tell ya

Niggas taking pictures any time we get together
And hope to fly away just one day like some love birds
Only one word that I'm afraid of is the "love" word

[Kanye West:]
More power to you, more power to you, my lovely one
More power to you, more power to you, my lonely one
More power to you, more power to you, my lovely one
What's up, bruh? That all depends
With friends like you, who need friends?
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when it's your advice

Oh! Man, remember
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member

Man, everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo
Ayy, bitch, you missed out, #fomo

I got one child, one child
But I'm fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' like I'm tryna make four more
They wanna throw me under a white jail
'Cause I'm a black man with confidence of a white male

Hallelujah

// Max B //

[Max B:]
Through the spot
Everyday was like a beef to me
Little nigga said he'd make it hot
You don't wanna draw heat with me
I got niggas that'll run up in your spot
Cooly nigga, you don't really want beef
I'm Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep

My bitch now tryna comfort me
And baby I wonder, baby I wonder

[A$AP Rocky:]
Uh, buccaneers of rugged gear, nigga fuck a fair
One, since year one, I've been thuggin' here, yeah, uh
Whole shit is ours, you in awe, please don't get involved
This is war, walk around a frame with blaze up in this jawn
Behind prison walls, niggas lickin' balls, pause
Different cause, stricted laws
Damn if I don't break up in the mall, prison yard, prison guard
No principal, detention on your friends and all
Commissary missing like your sibling's paw
Uncle Tom, please don't make my sentence long
Granted what I did was wrong
Pigs don't show remorse if you admit it all
Missing ma, hope that she don't miss the call
Admitted that she'll never visit

Like the hard-headed never listen, Lord
So tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to eat? (nigga)
If the richer's getting richer, the poor's growing weak
(Nigga)
My brother died up in the streets, may he rest in peace
Niggas got heat like Pusha T, get it cheap
Flacko how you been, where you at? I've been kickin' back
Relax place down my favorite thinking cap, scratch my nigga neck
Hitta chit and chat, this and that, A$AP diplomats
I'm missing Max, wish that they could bring the nigga Bigga back

[Joe Fox:]
And I wonder, laying in my bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?

[A$AP Rocky:]
It's like I lace up my boots and call my troops lately
Traded all my hoodie rap for all my suits lately
I'm 26 but I've been living in my youth lately
Pull my wisdom, but I still spit it like my tooth ache me
Duck shots, motherfuck cops, what the blood clot
All I gots my words and my balls and my one cock

Pause, buckshots fly, my young buck died
Passed away from a stray, from some fake tough guy
Now this the kind of story that should make doves cry
Fuck that, this the story that should make thugs cry
Dry your eyes older sis, held 'em close, watch 'em twitch
Gave 'em kiss in the midst of all of this
Ain't too late to pause or skip

[Joe Fox:]
And I wonder, laying in my bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?

[Max B:]
I'm Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep
Baby I wonder, baby I wonder

[Joe Fox:]
And I wonder, as I'm laying in my bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?
And I wonder, as I'm laying down in bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?

Sorry guys

// Pharsyde //

[Joe Fox:]
Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong
Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong
So, so

My ears are ringing, my palms are shaking, my heart is racing
Somebody's mama's heart is aching, can't take it, partly fainted
Found his body parts in awkward places
Like apartments, basements
Garbage, vacant lots, garages, spaces
Harlem's far too spacious

Sometimes I wish I could get away and charter spaceship
To get away from my inhuman race with hearts of Satans
Kick off my Maison Martin's
Lay on back like Martha Mason
Smoke away my iron lung 'til later die at 71, uhh

[Joe Fox & A$AP Rocky:]
I lay down now
There's someone's journey in the streets
Who gotta keep a piece, peace
I lay down now
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to God I rest in peace
I pray to Lord my soul to keep

[A$AP Rocky:]
Gentrification split the nation that I once was raised in
I don't recall no friendly neighbors face on my upraising
Back in my younger days of razor blades with gangs
Who bang and never stood a chance
Them boys don't dance, but left 'em Harlem shaking
On the pavement, and my generation fucked, and my society
Very trippy pages in my diary
It's the irony how LSD inspired me to reach the higher me

Used to never give a damn, now I don't give a fuck entirely
I think my pride died in me, somewhere inside of me
It's gotta be, a whole 'nother side of me
If you seen the shit that I'd have seen in 26 years of living
That's how many fucks I'd give (fuck)
So

[Joe Fox:]
Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong

[Joe Fox & A$AP Rocky:]
I lay down now
There's someone's journey in the streets
Who gotta keep a piece, peace
I lay down now
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to God I rest in peace
So, so

[Joe Fox:]
Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong

The hustle continues
Gettin' money is, gettin' money is
Put your mind to, something you want
Gettin' money is, gettin' money is
It come true

Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)
I thought you knew
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)
I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you baby)
It's what I do
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)

[A$AP Rocky:]
I remember all the nights
On different corners spittin', pitchin' water
Now I'm richer off the shit I thought of
From the home of the richest ballers
I'm Richard Porter mixed with Mr. Porter
This picture all the jiggy shit I ordered
I went to France and almost got deported
The fans is screaming when I hit the border
I visit Nice like it's my sister's daughter

Vision broad, I thought of all the different kids and all
Poor without a sip of water, time to get my shit in order
And do somethin' different, gettin' tired of the same old shit
When I'm spittin' lines 'bout the section lines
I sit you kids who listen for us

I see prison for us until we pull back, that's a true fact
Get money, yeah I do that, thought you knew that

[Juicy J:]
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)
I thought you knew
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)

Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you baby)
It's what I do
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)

[Pimp C:]
Candy low slider, I'm a soul survivor
Keep a Sweet in my visor, bitch I'm keepin' it liver
Than the average Joe, I think fast, talk slow
He think he want a war but he don't really wanna go
Need to get me some head from Sheryl Crow
A helluva blow, from a millionaire snow
You can waste your time, with the goody goody two shoes
Now I'm puttin' em on the spot, I give a ho the blues
I'm touchin' on her cot, I put her on the block
You think I'm startin' over, bitch I ain't never stop
Poppin' the trunk, and testin' the pills
Don't give a fuck 'bout where you're from
Don't give a fuck 'bout how you feel

[Juicy J:]
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)
I thought you knew
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)
I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you baby)
It's what I do
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)
I'm the best still in this game, I'm rich bitch like Rick James
Got a group of hoes in MIA, get a condo in Biscayne

The Louis store, I drop bands, the Gucci store, I drop bands
Prada store, I went HAM, my left wrist, it cost a Lam'
Your girlfriend a groupie, like Trident, she wanna chew me
Hell naw, I ain't cuffin' 'em, I'm a dog just like Snoopy

And when I leave the mall, it's sold out, erryday shoppin'
Taylor Gang, blowin' money, $50,000 on wrist watches
$100,000 in a plastic bag, we takin' off, bitch pack your bags
Bitch I came from having nothin', damn right I have to brag
Try me and I'll pop your ass, stupid nigga, get a body bag
All I talk is money ho, rich niggas don't lollygag

Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)
I thought you knew
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)
I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you baby)
It's what I do
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)

[Bun B:]
Gettin' money is the main reason most people wake up
The root of why most relationships is startin' breakups
While niggas get haircuts, and bitches do makeup
While we take their penitentiary chances, we shake up
It's an everyday struggle for the almighty dollar
Some is in the streets and some is workin' blue collar
Real up in your field and man it make you wanna holler
Say your prayer for a player, amen, inshallah

Been like that, ain't a damn thing change
Money on mind, the red of my brain
Candy paint is gonna drip that stain
Lean on left, the grip of my grain
See, ain't a damn thing change but the weather
So If you ain't breakin' bread then we can't even sit together

[Juicy J:]
Gettin' money is (What I, do)

// Westside Highway //

[A$AP Rocky:]
These days of preference has no complexion
You could be light, dark, mixed or fair skin
Just light the candle
Cold sweats down the handle, life's a gamble

And she know
Love with me is like a casino, outside of Reno
A couple white lines
A cup of white wine of Pinot, Italian Grigio
House keys to P.O
Ride from overseas but that's basic
Wasted, high on the West Side Highway
Drunk enough to fuck with, face it
Hangovers, leftovers in the Range Rover
Shame on her, make up or get a makeover
Think over, Glenfiddich start to takeover

When I brainstorm, all the hoes ain't got a thing on her
Audemars, season order like summer fall
I throw the Audemars, then I throw out all the ball
New Dior from the boutique store
Only thing in common that we got is that we want it all
Little cutie pie, saw her looking super fly
More Justin Timberlake on my suit and tie
Try to scrutinize, cause I keep two inside
Suicides? No sir, hoes get the Uber ride

Or we can kiss 'til the sun come up
Or, sit on my lap 'til somethin' come up
She ain't really wanna club, I don't really wanna judge
Girl just wanna have fun 'til the fun run up

[James Fauntleroy:]
On the highway to my place
It's higher than you ever been
By to my way, be all day
Me, you and all your friends
In love, fuckin'
In love, just too much, ohh

// Better Things //

Don't give a fuck about your man
I'm just seeing what it's hitting for (bitch I'm sayin')
How you fronting on the kid though?
You should fuck with me girl, you know what you need, girl
See I got used to livin' life up on my own, yeah
In search of love and for a wife to call my own, yeah
It's all I think about at nights when I'm alone, yeah
Swear that I can't get no rest in California

Swear that life is, just a whole bunch of vices

Niggas biting off of my shit my dick
Stay up in your chick ride stick without a license
Tell her hold on like some vice grips
Might just call her, let her ride with a baller
Look up on her face was priceless
Wonder what my type is, well, tonight Mrs. Lightskin
With a light mix or a light switch, white chick
Darkskin complexion and she righteous

I take a dyke chick if she like dick
I kissed the dyke chick and I liked it
Fucking each and every Katy Perry for the night bitch, light this

Light it, light it, puff it, puff it, pass it, pass it
(Moving on to better things, I'm sure)
Bless, sit back and relax one time, clear your mind
(Can't feed this addiction anymore)

'Bout to send me back to my old ways, know what I'm saying?
(Moving on to better things, I'm sure)
Yeah, I'm just, she making mistakes
(Can't feed this addiction anymore)

I've been puffing, rolling up
Cop a lot and pourin' up
Plus my niggas know the plug
A generation's thrown on drugs

I swear that bitch Rita Ora got a big mouth
Next time I see her might curse the bitch out
Kicked the bitch out once cause she bitched out, spit my kids out
Jizzed up all in her mouth and made the bitch bounce

Ride with a nigga mane, and you know
I stay fly like the jigga mane, and it figures

Cause here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man, anyways
Nowadays everybody's stressed, yes
Animosity is better off your chest, yes

Guess everybody want to stay blessed, stay fresh
Take a nigga threats, but I'm up next, take debts

Light it, light it, puff it, puff it, pass it, pass it
(Moving on to better things)
Inhale, exhale, relieve your mind of stress, bless
Smoke some one time for your boy A$AP
(Can't feed this addiction anymore)

I've been puffing, rolling up
Cop a lot and pourin' up
Plus my niggas know the plug
A generation's thrown on drugs

// M's //

[Lil Wayne:]
P.O
One time for A$AP Yams
Let's go

[A$AP Rocky:]
What's this I see? Niggas tryna act like G's
Got A$AP, got Fergy with me
It's a new day, no Black Eyed Peas
That's that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, that's that shit

(You ain't got no Flacko in your Serato?)
Mothafucka better blast that shit

Niggas drink quarts of the Clicquot
Bitches sniff raw of the kilos
Flacko makes sales of the perico
She knows, went to ATL for my C-Note
'Member, I ain't ever have no home
Now I got a penthouse and a beach home
Back when I was rockin' least (2 Chainz!!!)
I was trappin' off at least like three phones
Me and Yams made the plan
Then I paid myself and I gave myself advance
Way before I became myself
I'd like to thank myself because I made myself the man
It's like lately I ain't myself
I'd rather hang myself before I play myself
I tell her, "throw on the dress with the pinstripes"
Know the one that fit the booty all skin tight, that's right
Yeah, you that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, move that shit
Frontin' like you did it for the fellas
Get all the bitches jealous when you do that shit
But my neck is gold, the rest is froze
Sex and hoes, best of both, girls and girls, perpetual
Sippin' slow, Texas throwed
Comma, I'm about decimals
Chill and get faded, I'm surprised that we made it
Young niggas know the sky's the limit
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded
Chill and get faded, shit, I'm surprised that we made it
Nowadays stress overrated
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded

I wanna see you take it all off
And she just wanna make it harder
And we just end up takin' longer
Can't impress with them diamonds though, them diamonds

Talkin' about M's
Talkin' bout M's, nigga, M's
Make 'em talk about, make 'em talk about M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Make 'em talk about, talkin' bout M's, nigga
Talkin' bout M's

It's like lately all I ever seem to think about is M's, nigga
Talkin' 'bout M's
See the same thing all up in my bank account
M's, nigga, talkin' 'bout M's
And my YouTube account say the same amount
M's, nigga, talkin' 'bout M's

[Lil Wayne:]
Money talk and dogs bark
I got a pocket full of stones in my stonewashed
Lambo, brand new Lambo
With tiger stripes on it call that bitch a golf cart
I'm outchea, I'm so outchea, I swear niggas have no idea

I swear niggas better wear riot gear
Cause I appear and pow loud and clear give 'em diarrhea, oh
I re-up tonight, I'ma be up tonight, cookin' a key up tonight
Niggas de-up I slide to the right, throw a three up in time
Put a B up, let's fight, don't get beat up tonight
Feet up in my European, I ride with me heater inside

Kill you and your dog then go put on a shirt that say PETA for life
Like you sneeze you on tight, you got beef I got white
You got beef I got white, I got green, I got white
I got pink, I got pints, I got lean, I got ice
I got needles and pipes, I got clean, I got right

I got mean, I got nice, that's that Tina and Ike
I don't lean on her price, I don't cheat on her price
Try to cheat on the dice, you get beat on the spot
I get keys on the spot and I keep it on lock
And I keep it up safe, what you keep in your safe?
S'what I spent on my watch and I wave it like Ma$e
Bout to redo the face, get a see-through AK
I eat seafood and steak
But girl, I'ma treat you like cake til I get a sweet tooth tooth ache
But wait let's talk about M's, not about them

I love my BM's, I love my YM
Ain't no more CM
Let's pluck out the stems
Let's fuck like a nymph
She walk out, she limp, it's dark and we dim, yeah
We dem niggas, handcuffing him niggas back up and skim niggas
See that we strapped up we cap up your brim nigga
Fill my cup up to the rim nigga, Tunechi

// Dreams (Interlude) //

Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's good
Oh shit
Mushrooms, LSD, marijuana

Light that shit
Oh shit

This is every heavy drug, that's known at every level
This assault with deadly metal bumpin' heavy metal

Do this for myself, across my hood and every ghetto
Paper pushin', paper petal, cause I heavy petal
It's real nigga flowin' through my blood and every vessel
Time is money, so I saved the load on every bezel

I just had a dream, I dipped my watch canary yellow
I woke up and then I bought that bitch in every yellow

Let go back to business, my fits Prada for my Devil
Cause life's a bitch with red lipstick and high stilettos
Flacko jumpin' fences from pigs, with 'em them biscuits
I hypnotized my Sig, but my .38 was kinda special

What a life this is, what a sight this is
Where the darks and the light skin kids
Get along with the white persons

All alike when the lights get dim

On a righteous pass, where you don't look back
Nigga spark your cig, niggas light your hash
Niggas light your spliff, where you puff, don't pass, just sip it

I just had an epic dream like Dr. King
Police brutality was on my TV screen

Harmony, love, drugs, and peace is all we need
Harmony, love, drugs, and peace is all we need

// Everyday //

[Rod Stewart & Miguel:]
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go

[A$AP Rocky:]
Off again, there he go, to another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye probably goin' ballistic, but, listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws, they ain't never do drillin' true
You been sippin' away at the truth, a double shot of wisdom'll do
Do, do, rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses, to the bitches, holdin' biscuits
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence, go to prison

Go to church and pray the father, Lord forgive us (Amen)
And only God can judge me (Yeah)
And he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy

Yeah, I'm a piece of shit, I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, "Holler if ya need some dick"

The devotion is gettin' hopeless, but, hold it, I'm gettin' close
As my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts
, a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions, adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions

[Rod Stewart & Miguel:]
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am

So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go

[A$AP Rocky:]
Uh, this type of shit
Make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got 'em bustin' out the clip
In the middle of the office

And a message to the bosses
The Misfits' new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes keep on the sayin' that they 'caused it
'Cause the Porsches get 'em nauseous

Plus I ain't even mad yet, niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Hope they show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new Raf, that's good news

"Hood dudes usually don't look like you"
How it feel to get a deal and come back
And the whole hood look like you?
Screamin', "Pimp Squad, hold it down!"
Can't drive, bitch, I'm legally blind, bitch
If I live or die, it's up to me to decide

Shit, niggas coppin' guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a fa√ßade, bitch
And I'll be fine just-a drinkin' my wine, bitch

[Miguel:]
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine

[Miguel & Rod Stewart:]
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am

Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
I don't care if I ever know
Here I go, here I go, here I go!

[A$AP Rocky:]
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more, oh, no
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more, oh, no
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow

// Back Home //

Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I'm moving

[A$AP Rocky:]
War Lords, we all Lords, but we your Lords
Tryna find home, next stop is the Waldorf
Past the racism and fake-ism
Type of hate that make you feel worse than a rape victim

Raw dogs, you other niggas mad soft, mad I rap my ass off
They throwin' mad salt 'til I go bath salt
On wax, spitting heat to melt the wax off
I'm Mr. Miyagi in Issey Miyake
Asshole flow, fuck name brands, past logos

Now I'm onto grand raps, hands so low, uh
It's like my fashion style is the life saver
Guess she wasn't satisfied with titties that Christ gave her
Bragging that her new ass shots is a life changer
Head is so good on that girl that I might pay her, or nah
Super laid back cat, opposite of fat black, Al Capone
Tell them lil' niggas Flacko home

[Acyde:]
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long

[A$AP Rocky:]
Uhh, Father, Lord forgive me as I load up the semi

Roll through the city, that chose to resent me
Hold it, don't load it, reload it on plenty

Any foe or a
That ever voted against me, dissed me
Pissed me off then tried to hold it against me
Or wish we off the worst of luck that ever hated
Never hesitated, the designated, all of the wrong that they did me
Is stored in my memory all of the thoughts that I thought of
Means more for my enemies
Sippin' holy water like it's bore from my kidneys
Load the smoke like a chimney, make a toast for the memories
Make a toast for the Henny, it's the best for the remedies

Energy, synergy, frienemies, industries
Finna get advantage on him and his nemesis, bitches been sniffing
(Flacko Jodye Season)
If I, if I ain't the greatest, bitch I'm one of em
How in the fuck could you front on 'em?
My old ho beefing, my ex won't be friends

Bronson told me not to eat ham
Rest in peace Yams

[Acyde:]
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home
I've been away too long
Gotta find my way back home

[A$AP Rocky:]
Rest in peace Yams
RIP A$AP Yamborghini

We gon' take it uptown one time
We gon' take em back home, show 'em how we do
They call me Pretty Flacko ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to introduce Pretty Flacko Sr
Yasiin Bey

[Yasiin Bey:]
Magnum spectacular, black man megalas
Shine amethyst, fly champion, it's like that again
What's happening? Mathematics master blin'
Flacko season, all day, erryday
Ask me how it's going, I tell 'em on and on and on and on and

You led me out to Arizona, steady flowing, staying golden
Sand cover, ready rover
Flacko glowing in that Owens
That's how it's going
(Gotta find my way back home)
Huh, awareness to the areas, familiar with the routes
Travellin' man, moving through places
Space and time, in a country called Earth

[A$AP Yams:]
Nah'mean? These tacky ass muh'fuckers be in the pictures
Wearing all types of motherfuckin' red and green stripes
Over accessorizing out this motherfucker

We from Harlem, we gave y'all motherfuckers this wave
Grab y'all surfboards, cause y'all got your boogie boards right now out this motherfucker
Y'all just gon' keep watching us at the beach shore
With your motherfuckin' khakis rolled up
With your chancletas in your hand
And we just gon' keep surfing on this motherfucker

Straight up! It's ya' boy, A$AP Yams, Yamborghini
Yo Rock man, let these motherfuckers know what it is
Out this motherfucker, A$AP, bitch!
