The rum-gagger was about to shake the bullet
He'd enough cat speak to make any wise man dumb, but on this occasion the cat was without claws and destined for hell
Was this where the chicken got the axe? And fuck, he'd only believed parrots deserved almonds...
Taking the dagger from the tall boy, he thought of drowning himself
The highway surveyor had played her ace against his jack
The gagger knew she's bulldoze a show of white feathers
She wasn't about to fear shaking her cloth in the wind
He tried to break a straw with her but blandiloquence drew a blank
Red, red against green
Red, red against green
He'd got ooperzootics on the brain
His father got them, caused the old git to run around the house, naked, whooping and such-like
One-armed, queer-gammed, and sharp as the corner of a square table
Warm as they come
He wore yellow stockings for his queen of the dripping pan
The highway surveyor's former handle
Goodyear's pig had forded the river a spit away
Peeled eyes were the order of the day
Above, sun-dodgers prepared to turn the black spotlight on
