Oklahoma!

I admired your sexy hearse
You could tell I was dying
Under rehearsed

You found a secret place
The outer edge of inner space
A sunbeam hit your face
You were happy being there

I admire your sexy hearse
You knew I was dying
Over rehearsed

Under a pregnant cloud burst sky
You laughed and closed your eyes
We kissed you feigned surprise
Expressed a wish to learn to fly

Oklahoma

I admired your sexy hearse
It was true I was dying
Over rehearsed
I admired your sexy hearse
It was true I was dying
Over rehearsed!
