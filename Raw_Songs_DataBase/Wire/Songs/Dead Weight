Every risk you take could end in a thousand tears
Even triumphs turn to pain as they disappear
Strategies are all fine and good if they play out well
But you might be better off with a wishing well

Buried in a distant forest
Chapters lost and then retrieved
All the unheard answers fly
Glide like butterflies

Simple acts of faith can become a strategy
Elegance of considered thought leading to synergy
Create new pathways between the hemispheres of the brain
An unlikely path that might just keep you sane
