If he had a room, he'd paint it white
Avoids the day, prefers the night
Build sight

Got a head for figures
No time for bickerers, or so he says
Prefers the company of a woman
One, two, three, four

Finds it more physical
That's the important word
Always seen first then heard
Such a rare bird

With praise, he glows
With change, he grows
Finds that important, hates waiting
It's not stimulating, likes celebrating
I can't understand why that is so funny
That is sex
