Always cause for concern (always)
When you're feeling quite (bright) quite
And your filament burns

I feel mysterious today
Everything is humming loudly
I feel mysterious today
Everyone is coming this way

Is it ever appealing
To stand on a ceiling (watch out)
Observe the tension grow (grow, grow, grow)

I feel mysterious today
Everything is humming loudly
I feel mysterious today
Everyone is coming this way

Going walking abroad (walking)
Minus hat before dawn
Bats in profusion there

I feel mysterious today
Everything is humming loudly
I feel mysterious today
Everyone is coming my way

Did you ever conceive
That you too can leave
Exactly when you like
