Can I make it plainer?
I misjudged your intentions
Misread behaviour
That beggars many questions
What happened to our plan
The one that we began?
Are you an also-ran?
Finished? Inconsequential?

Declining, and divining
One of us will live to rue the day we met each other
One of us will live to rue the day we met each other
Breaching, over-reaching
One of us will live to rue the day we met each other
One of us will live to rue the day we met each other

It's a no-brainer
It's time to test the mettle
Reasoned? Insaner?
Infected scores to settle
No safety-netted plan
We're here, we will, we can
Finish what we began
Never, ever damned for trying...
