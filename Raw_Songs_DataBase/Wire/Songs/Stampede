In times of peril such as these
Pleased as punch but not so nimble
Taking chances that you're given

Take the Trabant to Brabant
Find security
In Western arms, in Western arms
Find security

The non-believers can't agree
Hands are tied, we can't discuss it
Swapping pot-pourri for concrete

Take the glitter to Gorky
Find security
In Western arms, in Western arms
Find security

Insiders think they've cracked the nut
Punch to please and not to crumble
Faking answers you are living

Empty larder history
Find security
In Western arms, in Western arms
Find security

The double agent's single cell
Splits the endgame party symbol
Forked, endorsed, but not forgiven

Delegations with stones
Find security
Buy Western charms, buy Western charms
With security
