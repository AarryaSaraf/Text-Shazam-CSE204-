The clouds were high
And the jury was hung

In a moment of doubt
The damage was done

Trust was lost
And the wheels had spun

In a moment of doubt
The damage was done

In a moment of doubt
The damage was done
In a moment of doubt
The damage was done

In a moment of doubt
The damage was done
In a moment of doubt
The damage was done
