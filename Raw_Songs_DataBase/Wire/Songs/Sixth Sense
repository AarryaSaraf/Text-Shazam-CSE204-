Who are the masked men?
Who are the cashed men?
Who are the flash men?

Where is the funman?
Where is the sunman?
Where is the gunman?

Where are the fast men?
Where are the past men?
Where are the last men?

On the table they're pawing the details
They wait for the meal to walk in the door
Edible hunter seeks credible victim
Sincerely rich seeks sceptical poor

In the corner they're shifting the ashes
Loyal traitor seeks empty womb
Oaken Tailor seeks viable impasse
Eternal youth seeks fatal bloom
