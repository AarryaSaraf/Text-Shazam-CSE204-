You're a voyeur junkie, you're a problem boy
The peeping Toms regard you as their toy
The keyboard cowboys have stolen your voice
You'd like to give it up but you haven't got a choice

You've got a morbid fascination and a twisted view
You want big brother to spy on you
The trouble is (and you know it's true)
You like to be watched and be the watcher, too
You tap your Morse from your specimen jar
You are the audience, you are the star

You like to be watched and be the watcher, too

You've got mail - you'd better read it or you will become detached
And you wouldn't want that
Would you?

You like to be watched and be the watcher, too
