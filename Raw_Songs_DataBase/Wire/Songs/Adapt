The tide is high, sandbag your street
Converging, swelling channels meet
The torrent roars, banks are breached
Stay calm, be cool, a part at least

The brakes are on, controlled retreat
Quick-go-slowly, heart valve weak
Fairness flounders, sincere cheats
Disgraced champions, taste defeat

Beware the timely statement leak
The trigger is the price of meat
Barricade your first floor doors
Evacuate your sick and poor

Be larger picture, stronger, deep
Be good, be bad, be more, elite
A prince of bread, a pint of peace
In Middle Earth, in Middle East

Go east, go north, go south, go west
Leave mouths open, with your best
Adapt to change, stay unimpressed
Adopt: 'Chekov', to family crest
