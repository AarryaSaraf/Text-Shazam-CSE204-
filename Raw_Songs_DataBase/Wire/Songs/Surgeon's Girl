Sitting in a surgeon's world, a surgeon's will
A surgeon's girl with me
Standing on a river bed, where weeds can be
I'm on my knee, to you
I've seen in glossy mags
I've seen you and you see me
I've seen you and you see me

Said you weren't a tuna fish, put in a tin
They're very big, ha ha
I've seen in glossy mags
I've seen you and you see me
I've seen you and you see me
