Mist closing in, getting thicker
One drops out, becoming quicker
Lights grow dim, they glimmer
The chances smaller, the odds are slimmer

Dot dash...
Dip flash...
Don't crash...

Loosening my grip
Be sure to tread carefully
Steering a passage
Finding a line

Cross to comply, crossply
Progressive acceleration, skidding but the expression
Remains pan, radiators for all
Radial, I'm still in control
I understand, a hand, a hand moved me

Dot dash...
Dip flash...
Don't crash...

Driven by self-propulsion
Turning right across the stream
The risks increased with sustained leisure
Courting death, so ill at...ease

Dot dash...
Dip flash...
Don't crash...
