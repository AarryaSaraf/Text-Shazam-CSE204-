I catch the word, don't refrain
Oh no, it's not the same
In two halves but quickly growing whole
It's not the past again
In double figures for the first time
Oh no, it's not the same
There may be a story to be told
But it's not the past again

It's time to get out now
Everybody loves the mystery
Everybody loves their history
It's not my problem now
Everybody loves the mystery
Everybody loves their history

Implications, back and up
Oh no, it's not the same
In two parts and waiting to be told
That it's not the past again
In time and sequence, paraphrased
Oh no, it's not the same
In two halves but quickly growing whole
And it's not the past again
