People standing, greeting, talking
People kissing, missing, whistling

Have you ever been
Washed off the beach
Have you ever been
Swept out of reach

People walking, stalking, hawking
Vehicles parking, dogs are barking

Have you ever been
Washed off the beach
Have you ever been
Swept out of reach

People shopping, buying, selling
People smoking, joking, hoping

Have you ever been
Washed off the beach
Have you ever been
Swept out of reach
Have you ever been
Washed off the beach
Have you ever been
Swept out of reach

People praying, disappearing
CC. cameras, knives and hammers

People sleeping, broken, beaten
People lying, homeless, dying
