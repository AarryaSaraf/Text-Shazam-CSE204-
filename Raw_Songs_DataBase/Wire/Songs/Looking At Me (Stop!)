Stop! If I've told you once, I've told you twice
And if I've told you twice, I've told you a thousand times
Just stop! I've give you an inch, but you've taken a mile
Stop! Don't do as I do, do as I say
Stop! It's under your nose. Stop!

It seems to me and it's written here
Not much fun but quite sincere
Information since received
Pardon me if I just breathe

Up down here there nowhere
Bus stop hope stop all flop
Up down here there nowhere
Bus stop hope stop all flop

It seems to me and I've always known
Something I have never owned
Information in progress
Leaves me cold, I do confess

Stop! The streets are filled with howling cheese
The two tailed dog tries hard to please
Sitting on its bag of fleas and barking at the noise of trees
It's under your nose

It seems to me there should have been
Someone who would intervene
Information here attached
Told us that he'd just been snatched

Stop! With a leg of mutton, D beats his wife in an everlasting life
Going to Heaven on a string, the piggers horse shoes ring. Stop!
