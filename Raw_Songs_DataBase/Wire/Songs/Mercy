Crooks lay in a weighted state
Waiting for the dead assassin
While the rust pure powder puffs
A shimmering opaque red
Papers spread, no one driving
We hurled direct ahead
The windows dark-green tinted
The hearse a taxi instead

Snowstorms forecast imminently in areas
Dogger, Viking
Moray, Firth, and Orkney
Keeping cover in denuded scrub
The school destroyed raised the club
Panic spreading with threat of fire
Crowding beneath a layer of foam
Refugees intertwined, alone

Within the institution walls
In pastel blue, clinical white
Slashed red lipsticked walls
Mercy nurse tonight

Seems like dark grey stockings
In the waking torchlight
With a 4 AM stubble
A midnight transvestite

Always fast and bubbly
