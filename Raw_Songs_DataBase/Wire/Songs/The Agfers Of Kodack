Nest in a bird, an enemy flew in
Fashion a life out of audio ruin
Farmers of God, is it good what you're doing?
Chanting a curse whilst religiously chewing

Is it time to repair? Is it time for unlocking?
To the shrine of the nomads, the pilgrims are flocking
Tracing a bee-line to witness a flogging
A slayer of giants in the finest of stockings
Tracing a bee-line to witness a flogging
A slayer of giants in the finest of stockings

Hearing the cheering of mothers and daughters
There's change in the air and a shortage of water
A bounty is posted, conditions: no quarter
Don't bargain with fish which are still in the water

A love of the camera; a stomach for slaughter
Fresh from the front: our favourite reporter
The risks are increasing, she'd hang if they caught her
The odds on survival grow shorter and shorter...

Is it time to repair? Is it time for unlocking?
To the shrine of the nomads, the pilgrims are flocking
Tracing a bee-line to witness a flogging
A slayer of giants in the finest of stockings
