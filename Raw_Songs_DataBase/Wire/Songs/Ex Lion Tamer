There's great danger (danger)
For the loneliest ranger in town
No silver bullets (bullets)
Tonto's split the scene

Next week will solve your problems
But now, fish fingers all in a line
The milk bottles stand empty
Stay glued to your TV set (TV)

There's great danger (danger)
At hand, most caped crusader of all
No cloak of justice (justice)
Robin's quit the scene

Next week will solve your problems
But now, fish fingers all in a line
The milk bottles stand empty
Stay glued to your TV set (TV)

Stay glued to your TV set, oh (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set, oh (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set, oh (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set, oh why don't ya, don't ya, don't ya? (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set, oh why don't ya, don't ya, don't ya? (TV)
Stay glued onto your TV set (TV)
