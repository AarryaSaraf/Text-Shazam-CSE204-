The sun was going down
Shadows lengthened on the ground
Snow fell silently and deep
Blanketing the empty streets
In a fragile way, couldn't face another day
In need of love and care, broken, under repair

I'm the quicksands of despair
In the desert of unfair
You found me drowning there
Caught my glance of do not care
You took me to your bed, laid your hands upon my head
Said, "Sleep now have no fear, you are safe for I am here"

We'd talked the night away, into another day
In the morning, you were gone, now every moment seems too long
My thoughts went round and round, impossible to sleep
I started burning bridges, when I gave up counting sheep

An asbestos chimney, can shorten your life
