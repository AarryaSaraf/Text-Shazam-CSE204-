Starting with an ABC
Wanting to drillfully
Editing skillfully
Arguing forcefully

Want to drill you
Want to drill you

Any small thing that we find
Lengthened moments in the sea
Driving me home
Any places far or near

Want to drill you
Want to drill you

It begins at one and is followed by two
An X marks the spot where I met U

I want to drill you
I want to drill you
In the heart of the earth under the ground
In every city and every town
I want to drill you
I want to drill you
I want to drill you

Want to drill you (I want to drill you)
Want to drill you (I want to drill you)

If you're saved or if you're lost
If you are free, what is the cost?
I want to drill you

Driving me home
Driving me home
Any places far or near
Any places far or near

Want to drill you (I want to drill you)
Want to drill you (I want to drill you)
Want to drill you (I want to drill you)
Want to drill you (I want to drill you)
Want to drill you
Want to drill you

If you're scarred, if you're a fool
If you are hot, if you are cool
It's up to you, it's up to me
There's only one thing that it can be
One

Want to drill you
Want to drill you
