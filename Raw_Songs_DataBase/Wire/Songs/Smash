I remember what he said:
"We are all like spuds and bread!"
Crash at random, road-kill rage
Tarmac trauma auto slain!

I remember what he claimed:
"Shadowed blood and spit remains!"
Fur and guts and stone chip stain
Broken bones on the inner lane

I remember what he said:
"Count to ten when you see red!"
Plus plus ultra uber rage
Plus plus ultra uber rage

Behold the woods of yesterday
Just beyond the motorway
Saw a stag walking away
Thro' the frame of faraway
