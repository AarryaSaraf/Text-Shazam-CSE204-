Under the hammer
A celebration of childhood
An impeding stammer
Words alone matter
When visual sense fails
Estimates broken

Shooting through the shooting forests
On the move and in the hunt
Free to catch fresh scents
The dog flanks
Mend your ways but split your ends

Tiny terror
Orange fly weight
Box above don't hit below
Speeding through the ever
Changing seasons
Come, and people go

Shooting through the shooting forests
On the move and in the hunt
Free to catch fresh scents
The dog flanks
Mend your ways but split your ends

A trawler captain
Scoops the loot
As prices shoot
Purple panther
Pulls the shades
And draws my fire

Shooting through the shooting forests
On the move and in the hunt
Free to catch fresh scents
The dog flanks
Mend your ways but split your ends

Mend your ways but split your
Mend your ways but split your
Mend your ways but split your
Mend your ways but split your
Mend your ways but split your
Mend your ways but split your
Mend your ways but split your
Mend your ways but split your
Ends
