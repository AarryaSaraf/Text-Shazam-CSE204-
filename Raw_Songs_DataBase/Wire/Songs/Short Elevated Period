Skippering a skiff, in the typhoon season
Open to change and in need of a hand

No longer confused by rhyme nor reason
Indian queens paddle dugout canoes

The passenger matches the price that he's asking
Embracing the modern he now understands

It's a pivotal moment, in an uncertain future
A pain relief deal done on the Frankfurt express

Right up to the moment I I.D. you
My reasons for living were under review

A parting of the ways, what had it come to?
Standing in the road, where would I go?

In a short elevated period
In a short elevated period
In a short elevated period
In a short elevated period
In a short, short, short, short elevated period
In a short, short, short, short elevated period
In a short elevated period
