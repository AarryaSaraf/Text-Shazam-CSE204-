Can you tell me what you saw?
Can you tell me what you thought you heard?
Or were you just oblivious?
No recall to re-assess

Was it true or simply words?
Was my answer fully understood?
Or were you just oblivious?
No will left to re-address

Did you believe a thing I said?
To put it yet another way
Was it just too obvious?
Lost between the two of us?

Had you faith in what you tried to do?
Or simply had to have another view
You were being devious
Always dark and circumspect
