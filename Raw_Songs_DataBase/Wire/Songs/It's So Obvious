It's so obvious
It's here, it's there
It's not just the colour
It must be more
At least seventeen and three score

This is '77
Nearly heaven
It's black, white, and pink
Just think
There's more to come
Hum hum hum hum
It's so obvious

Well, it's alright, just listen
Can't wait for '78
God those RPM
Can't wait for them
Don't just watch
Hours happen
Get in there kid and
Snap them
