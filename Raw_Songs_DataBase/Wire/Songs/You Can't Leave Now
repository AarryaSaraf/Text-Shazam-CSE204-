The dogs wait in the street
Sensing fresh meat
It's time they were fed
Even though you're as good as dead
You know you have to go
But your movements are too slow

You've eaten your way through
The whole menu
You've savoured every thrill
But haven't paid the bill
And you can't leave now

Your options have run out
Leaving you on your own

You've eaten your way through
The whole menu
You've savoured every thrill
But haven't paid the bill
And you can't leave now
