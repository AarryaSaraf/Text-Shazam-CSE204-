Gifts of the west winds
Dark and deep
In secret sunset
Places creep

Lock up your hats
Lock up your hats

To practice with at home
A schism with an ism
To practice with at home
A collision with decision
To practice with at home

He transferred his soul
To his imagination
His atoms were excited
And he glowed in the dark
The boiling boy
Was a picture of confusion
But he had the advantage
Of a cold start heart
