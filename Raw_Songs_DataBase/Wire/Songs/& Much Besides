Rescued from uncertain fates aided by subtle metamorphic shifts
An unwrapped past? Maybe. A chance to reconfigure DNA? Perhaps
Could allow new horizons to become our vantage point

Play up, play out, play hard, play fair
Say echoes from an unknowable past
Even though edifices rise and crumble, our narratives give choice
A shining path to absolution, or endless folly?

To bring a culture of new beginnings must surely be the desired result
Directives remain flippant while much remains unresolved

But change becomes us all in time-the course is set
