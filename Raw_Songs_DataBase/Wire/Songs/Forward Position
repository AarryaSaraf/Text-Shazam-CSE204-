Shake me if there's any movement
Warn me if you hear a sound
Coded, flickered, triggered
Signals buried underground

From my ruin, long forgotten
Dreams of hope arise in smoke
I am black box, I remember
Every promise that you broke

Knowing there's no point in running
At daybreak, we'll soon be found
Wake me when you see them coming
Hear their steel keels run aground

From my ruin, long forgotten
Dreams of hope arise in smoke
I am black box, I remember
Every promise that you broke

The canyon floor provides protection
The star-filled sky is dark remote
Satellite and drone detection
Seize the time and catch your throat

Buildings opened to the sky glow
Timbers tumble through the floor
Chopper downwash; overhead noose
Jet buzz lasso, stay indoors
