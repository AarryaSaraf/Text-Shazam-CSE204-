The world is half-eaten
Mother Nature is nearly beaten
And the signs are everywhere
My DJ can't mix it
And God can't fix it
Because his plane is already in the air

The temperature is rising
It isn't surprising
The fires are everywhere
There won't be any water
The winters are getting shorter
I'd like to leave
But have not got the fare
