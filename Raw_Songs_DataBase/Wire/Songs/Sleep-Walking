We're at a tipping point
The arguments may lead
To less cohesion
A mere collection of parts

Sleepwalking to separation
Who'd give the perpetrators
A second chance
If reason could prevail

The narrowest vision
Often has the widest appeal
A lack of decision
Leaves us open for a steal
Left out, abandoned
We're less than ideal

Whose rights to shout the loudest?
Should bully tactics triumph
When no one cares
And all stand idly by

The narrowest vision
Often has the widest appeal
A lack of decision
Leaves us open for a steal
Left out, abandoned
We're less than ideal
