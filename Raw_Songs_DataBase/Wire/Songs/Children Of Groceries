No one from a glass has landed
The beam is down
Colours in regiments
Out of body experiences

The alien kidnappers
They place our graves
Ride the highways
Buying smiles

Bite off your tongue
Swallow it whole
Before it wags
Betrays us all

Purvey sour dreams
Will drink enterprise
Off-white off-set
Children of groceries
