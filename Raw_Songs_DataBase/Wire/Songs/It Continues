It continues, it continues, it continues to escape me
It's not quite right the way you're trying to ape me
Observing my movements, trying to place me
I heard you'd laid plans to finally interface me

It's a cheerless thing, that thing you call a heart
That small black thing that's keeping us apart
Don't even think about it, don't you even try to start
I can see you in the corners, I can see you in the dark

It continues, it continues, it continues to escape me
It's not quite right, the way you're trying to implicate me

What would it be to know?
What would it be to have an answer?
Would it be worth your while?
Could it all end in disaster?

Standing in this garden just before the dawn
A place of amusement, an object of scorn
From the back of beyond to the front of the queue
From the change in the air, I knew it was you

It continues, it continues, it continues to escape me
It's not quite right the way you're trying to trace me

What would it be to know?
What would it be to have an answer?
Would it be worth your while?
Could it all end in disaster?

What would it be to know?
What would it be to have an answer?
Would it be worth your while?
Could it all end in disaster?

Don't you even think about it, don't you even try to start
I can see you in the corners, I can see you in the dark

It continues, it continues, it continues to escape me
It's not quite right they way you're trying to implicate me
Talking to my friends, trying to replace me
Picking up clues to finally trace me

Well, it continues, it continues, it continues to escape me
It's not quite right, the way you're trying to implicate me
It's a simple structure and if it falls apart
How would you replace it, where could you even start?
