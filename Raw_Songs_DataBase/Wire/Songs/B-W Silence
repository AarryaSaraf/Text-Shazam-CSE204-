I'm mourning the passing of a moment, in black and white silence
Uneasily, I slept
I cannot accept your tears as an answer
Or is this an excuse for your selfishness?

I came, it was so... I wanted to go
I came, it was so... I wanted to go

Irrational in the extreme, it makes such perfect sense
Lost in a moment, cold without regret
Was this an excuse for my selfishness?

I came, it was so... I wanted to go
I came, it was so... I wanted to go
