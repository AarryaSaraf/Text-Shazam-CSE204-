Antennaes my currency
Programme your set
My pockets are drunk
The Illinois tool works
The flight nurse attends me
I can't wait to see the doctor
Be smart shrink the world?
But I can't wait to see the doctor

Dust-off ready
Take-off
Oil a mink
Follow the locust

Write a letter, drop a card
Diagram, map a chart
Take a note, pick a snap
Choose a number, dial a code
The flight nurse attends me
But I can't wait to see the doctor
Be smart shrink the world?
But I can't wait to see the doctor

Stay on your feet
And get collected
Enjoy and explore
The gambling museum
The flight nurse attends me
But I can't wait to see the doctor
Be smart shrink the world?
But I can't wait to see the doctor
