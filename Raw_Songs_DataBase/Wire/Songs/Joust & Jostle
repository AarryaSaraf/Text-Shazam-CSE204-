The joust and jostle
Cooking, rolling
Bingo bombing
Off the wall plane
The reason that you're late
I don't speak to them
Winding up they, smell defeat
Crumble dice games
To the 
Ice climb dancing
Dancing shoes on
Whistle for love song
Game is on the move
In a place in which
We belong

The Flying Dutchman
Touches land, he

Tends the land
The lunar land
But the 
Touches gently
It's that moment
Safe from hazard 
Make her stronger
Way that type is
I'm in love with you
Cross our hearts and
Hope to die
The love we're hoping
Start to fly
