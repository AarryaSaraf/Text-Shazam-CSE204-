Think of a number
Divide it by two
Something is nothing
Nothing is nothing
Open a box
Tear off the lid
Then think of a number
Don't think of an answer
Open your eyes
Think of a number
Don't get swept under
A number's a number

A chance encounter you want to avoid
The inevitable
So you do, oh yes you do
The impossible

Now you ain't got a number
You just want to rhumba
And there ain't no way
You're gonna go under

Go under, go under
Go under, go under
You tear me asunder
Go under, go under
Go under, yeah
