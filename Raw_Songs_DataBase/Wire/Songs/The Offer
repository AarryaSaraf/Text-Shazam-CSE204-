I got to be for the offer of virtue
Once in and taken apart
This is the shape of interference
Please don't adjust your heart

Now touching the edges of something
Wanting to find truer response
Could I ever erase the influence?
Brushing in against what's (already) understood

Dredging shifting basing phrasing
Once in and taken to heart
I fought your red colour
I scratch your head again

Staring trying embracing gazing
I shot your silver dollar
Fill the space within your heart
You wear my golden collar
