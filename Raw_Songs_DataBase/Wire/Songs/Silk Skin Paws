You have nothing to fear
I'm just making enquiries
Dog bone hunting
Gives you back to yourself
Standing before me
The gargoyle turns
Jutting jaws
And the stubble burns

I shift the blame
To the worm in the bottle
I shift the blame
To anyone standing before me

I check-up the once over
Give yourself an opening
Keep your mouth shut
In the event of an accident
Contact the following
A certain air
An invading smile
Inbreeding seals the flaw

I shift the blame
To the worm in the bottle
I shift the blame
To anyone standing before me

I shift the blame
To the worm in the bottle
I shift the blame
To anyone standing before me

Silk skin paws
Hang by both feet
Embracing the world
Hang the expense
Breugels cut corners
Wring out the senses
I have nothing like it
I've seen nothing like it

I shift the blame
To the worm in the bottle
I shift the blame
To anyone standing before me
I shift the blame
To the worm in the bottle
I shift the blame
To anyone standing before me
