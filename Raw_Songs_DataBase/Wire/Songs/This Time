Some folks believe in magic
Does voodoo-hoodoo do it for you?
Some folks claim they know all the answers
And for a price they'll share them with you

This time it's going to be better
This time I'm going to be strong
This time I refuse to get bitter!
Even though I knew you were wrong!

Some folks have the gift for living
Others make a living hell
Some folks take love as a given
And can't stop falling under its spell

This time it's going to be better
This time I'm going to be strong
This time I refuse to get bitter!
Even though I knew you were wrong!
