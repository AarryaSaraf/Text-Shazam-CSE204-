One of the men that spawned fibre optic prawns
Barely concealed a grand canyonic yawn
Passed a Nationalist getting buried in Manchester
In Manchester

Tricolour flying, the sun shining, large crowd around
A freshly dug grave, priest arm blesses, the flag is waving
Stern Indian serves original flavourings, in Manchester
In Manchester
In Manchester
Ah huh

I don't yet know how my story will end
Dead or in prison or completely around the bend
A strong punch was essential, dust heads exploded

In Manchester
In Manchester
In Manchester
In Manchester
Ah huh
...
