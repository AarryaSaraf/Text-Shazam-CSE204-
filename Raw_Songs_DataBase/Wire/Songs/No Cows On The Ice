Is it true? It's enough for you
Is it true? Or as before
Is it true? You still need more
Is it true? No marks are left
Is it true? Upon the snow
Is it true? No one will know

No cows on the ice
Every dog has its day
Whilst the cat's away
Blind mice will play

Can it be? Or is it true?
Can it be? There's nothing new
Can it be? It's new to me
Can it be? You milked the moon
Can it be? You jumped too soon
Can it be? You milked the moon

Is it true? Your days are long
And what was right has become wrong
In a room without a view
Your past slips by, no calls come through
