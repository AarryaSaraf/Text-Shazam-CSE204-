I was sold up the river to the red slave trade
The stores were gathered, the plans were laid
Synchronised watches at 18:05
How many dead or alive in 1955?

The pink flags were screaming
Bugle boys sucked and blew
No time for confessions, orders given
Books were cooked, on the fourth of the third
How many seen or heard on the twelfth of the third?

How many dead or alive?
How many dead or alive?
How many dead or alive?
How many dead or alive?

How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?

How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?

Yeah
