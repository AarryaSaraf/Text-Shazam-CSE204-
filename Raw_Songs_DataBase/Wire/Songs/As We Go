Green jungle, the eventual abode
In which the specimen grows

We swim and splash as we go

Adorning your bodies with ornaments
Protecting your borders with armaments

We sing and dance as we go
We sing and dance in the Congo

Shifting your shape and the scenery
Misuse and abuse of machinery

We sing and dance as we go
We sing and dance in the Congo

Remove vegetation, clear the trees
It all becomes part of our history

We swing advance as we go
We swing advance, we're on show
We sing and dance as we go
We sing and dance in the Congo
