Two people in a room
Facial movements betray
(A private display
Of nervous disorder)
And mutual torture

Two people in a room
(Bloody image is conjured
But no one is injured)
The weapons are chosen
But the action is frozen

Two people in a room, positions are shifted
The ceasefire uplifted, the lighting is fierce
It's intended to pierce any cloak of deceit
And encourage retreat, and God they're so gifted
My God, they're so gifted, my God, they're so gifted

Two people in a room
A personal locations
(An indication
Of previous decisions)
Aggressive decisions
