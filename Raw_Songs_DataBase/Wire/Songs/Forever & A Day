Are you in trouble? Are you in pain?
Doubts and pulse doubled? Is it hard to explain?

Ooh! Darling, I want you to stay
Ooh! Darling, forever and a day

The vile double bubble was clearly to blame
The vile double bubble, it had poisoned your brain

Ooh! Darling, I want you to stay ooh!
Darling, forever and a day

Your values are roubled, accounts have been drained
Virtue's been coupled, only shadows remain

Ooh! Darling, I want you to stay ooh!
Darling, forever and a day
