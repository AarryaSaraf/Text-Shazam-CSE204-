Splinter of wood underneath a nail
Spiked on a tree where hope was pinned

Pining for a moment of even more
It just slipped out there

Harping on the old tune, playing the piping
Suspense on a bridgehead distorting and curving classical angles

Hanging in the slipstream
Is there any movement?
Swaying in the shadows
Could this be my moment?

Novel undertakings clear the place where it all feeds in
Promising tomorrows we shall see what we shall see

Forensic score the final test, borrowing blood the final brief
Quicken to the point express arrival, it's yours today
