A grand mute proof at Nemrt Dag
That man's as mad as a hatter

How does it feel when it's revealed?
You've reached the living end

Master cut the stone out
My name is Lubert Das
Abandoned now as the grass grows out
Of the head and groin of the dome

How does it feel with one turn of the wheel?
You reach the living end

Master cut the stone out
My name is Lubert Das
A far-u ranch at Ufra Charin
Fish ponds and a madman's honey

How does it feel, is it hard to conceal?
When you reach the living end
