High on snowploughs
Escape brief loveless
Our maple leaf
Ancestral shame

The where and when to, you aspire
A Wren born guide, to London's spires

Denounce the church
Of herding cats
Build pyramids
Of acrobats

The who and what to, you desire
An arsonistic, love of fire

The how and if
For budding liars
The Trappist guide
To happy hours
