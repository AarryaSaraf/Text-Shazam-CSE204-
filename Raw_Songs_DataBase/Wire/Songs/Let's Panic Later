Lights focused for another country
Diplomatically immune, diplomatically immune
My passport's stamped, my visa's in order
Diplomatically immune, diplomatically immune

A grey sky in March helps me to remember
Ein bier, ein cafe, ein bier, ein cafe
The freezing fog in mid-November
Downhill all the way, downhill all the way

How I wish the roads were straighter
Let's panic later, let's panic later
Let's panic later, let's panic later

My reservations and impatience grow
All of the time, all of the time
Honesty and humour thrive in the harsh city
Stripped and alert, stripped and alert
Stripped and alert, stripped and alert

Highly emotional, but this time composed
What is in store? What is in store?
What is in store? What is in store?
What is in store? What is in store?

This time composed
Let's panic later, let's panic later
Let's panic later, let's panic later
Let's panic later, let's panic later
