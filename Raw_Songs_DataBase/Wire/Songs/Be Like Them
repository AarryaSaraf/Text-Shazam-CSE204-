It's nothing new, hungry cats
Getting fatter minds and thinner ideas
Nothing new about that
Too little of this
Not enough of that
Nothing new about that

Insomnia dogs me, in this tired year

It's history, rabid dogs
Tearing skeletons into piles of bones
Nothing new about that
Too little of this
Not enough of that
Nothing new about that

They play it all for you
They explain it all to you
Telling you to be like them
Be like them

A state of irritation with leisurely pace
They lay it down for you
They set it up for you
Demanding that you too be like them
Be like them

It's a cracker joke, a cheap surprise
Painting in the corner, repeat flagrant lies
A shortage of ice, big increase of less
Standing far apart, world dying at your feet

They play it all for you
They explain it all to you
Telling you to be like them
Be like them demanding that you too be like them
Be like them
Be like them
Be like them
Be like them
