It's coming fast
It's a comet
Coming this way
With your name on it
It's a heaven-sent
Extinction event

And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
B-b-b-b-b-bang
Then a whimper

And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
B-b-b-b-b-bang
And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
B-b-b-b-b-bang
And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
B-b-b-b-b-bang
And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes

And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
B-b-b-b-b-bang
And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
And the chorus goes
