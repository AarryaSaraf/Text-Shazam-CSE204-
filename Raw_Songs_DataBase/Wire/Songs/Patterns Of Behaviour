End part beginning
17 and counting
Erase then cut and paste
From here to another place

Demonstrations, indignations
Colour, colour, collar, nation

Empty and filling
Ready and willing
A brase to cut and dash
It's another current fashion

Patterns of behaviour
I've been to Monrovia
Inflate to make a splash
Cut and diced it always lacks passion
