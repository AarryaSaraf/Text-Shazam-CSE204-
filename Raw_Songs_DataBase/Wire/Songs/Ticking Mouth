Smiles like bullets, looks that could kill
Don't be caught with a hand in the thrill
Not always a matter of choice
And I hear a ticking in your voice

A numbing cold that weakens the will
A wining way that sweetens the pill
Not always a matter of choice
And I hear a ticking in your voice

Close together, we stand apart
Is that a ticking in your heart?
And I hear a ticking in your heart

A raging silence that lies cannot fill
A numbing cold that weakens the will
Not always a matter of choice
And I hear a ticking in your voice

Is that a ticking in your voice?
