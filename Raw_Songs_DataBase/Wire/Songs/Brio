A plumed display, enlarged with brio
A promised four becomes a trio
Two days before, we lost your hero
Scorched the earth, returned to zero

Six cranes graze, a field of clover
Three deer hug the forest fringe

Two days before, we lost your hero
Scorched the earth, returned to zero
Two for one and one for all
The risk is huge, rewards are small

Six cranes graze, a field of clover
Three deer hug the forest fringe
Six cranes graze, a field of clover
Three deer hug the forest fringe
