Day delayed messages, arrive and repeat, ah, ah
Ernest T. died, so we'll now never meet
I set fire to the kitchen, the damage was bad, ah, sad
I sat down by the fountain, went quietly mad

I'm worried, I'm worried, there's cause for concern
I lit the touch paper and it started to burn
I'm worried, I'm worried there's cause for concern
Ignited and cornered, there's nowhere to turn

Better 'fess up, you're right off the scale, ah, but
Lately the second, swallowed a whale
Reality bends, and the hospital curves, ah, ah
Was it the weather, which got into your nerves?

I'm worried, I'm worried, I'm frightened as hell
I heard voices echo way down in my shell
I'm worried, I'm worried, I'm frightened as hell
Walls closing in, I'm feeling unwell

Oh, was it the weather, which got into your nerves?
Oh, was it the weather, that got into your nerves?
Oh, was it the weather, that got into your nerves?
Oh, was it the weather, that got into your nerves?
