Look to the right
Fields on fire
Look to the left
What can you see?
A mint green bathroom
On a walless house

Welcome!

Drive into the Mickey Mouse
The must place to be?
The place we never enter
If we are not with us

Enter!

Look down the street?
A young boy hunting butterflies
Look down the street?
He swallows one
He swallows two
That is not enough

Stay!

In the bed for two hundred crowns
I waited for you
Me and the dancing lamp
With a VIP card
I would have met the blue man
I hear his noise in the stairs

Listen!

Can you hear the ocean?
Did you hear the thunder?
Did you see the signs left by the boy
Who fell through the frozen sea?
The world turned upside down

Down!
