// Take It (For Greedy) //

Take my trip
Take the weight
Take it like a man, or
Take it straight
Take it home
Take the case
Take a break from the human race

Take your time
Take a slice
Take a piece
Take a bite
Take the smooth
Take the rough
Take a pinch
Take enough
Take a cut
Take the best
Take what's yours, and
Take the rest
Take the buck
Take the pot
Take it all, please
Take the lot
Take it all, please, take the lot

Take it on
Take good care
Take to the hills, or
Take to the air
Take the hint
Take the cake
Take the poison for goodness sake

// So And Slow It Grows //

Slow so slow and so it grows
Slow and slow and so it grows
Slow so slow and so it grows
Slow and slow and so it grows

It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if you're captivating
It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if you're charged and waiting
It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if you're celebrating
It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if you're hesitating

Slow so slow and so it grows
And so it shows and so it grows
And so it's slow so slow it grows
It's slow it shows for those who grow

It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if you're fascinating
It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if you're scintillating
It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if your breath's escaping
It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if it makes you happy
