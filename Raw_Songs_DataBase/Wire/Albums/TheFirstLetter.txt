// Take It (For Greedy) //

Take my trip
Take the weight
Take it like a man, or
Take it straight
Take it home
Take the case
Take a break from the human race

Take your time
Take a slice
Take a piece
Take a bite
Take the smooth
Take the rough
Take a pinch
Take enough
Take a cut
Take the best
Take what's yours, and
Take the rest
Take the buck
Take the pot
Take it all, please
Take the lot
Take it all, please, take the lot

Take it on
Take good care
Take to the hills, or
Take to the air
Take the hint
Take the cake
Take the poison for goodness sake

// So And Slow It Grows //

Slow so slow and so it grows
Slow and slow and so it grows
Slow so slow and so it grows
Slow and slow and so it grows

It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if you're captivating
It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if you're charged and waiting
It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if you're celebrating
It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if you're hesitating

Slow so slow and so it grows
And so it shows and so it grows
And so it's slow so slow it grows
It's slow it shows for those who grow

It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if you're fascinating
It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if you're scintillating
It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if your breath's escaping
It's just for now, it's just for now
Even if it makes you happy

// A Bargain At 3 And 20 Yeah! //

Attempts to fly are welcome... They attract a crowd willing to pay for a miracle. If you're homeless I know a roof you can jump off. You're got a cat and I've got a dog that climbs trees. Inevitable's too late. Yes is a bargain! No's a turn off! You either live or... Your edam. You either stretch or... You get stiff. Enjoy the joyride!

Deterministic, anti-ballistic, not too drastic, ritualistic, operatic, automatic, quite grammatic, seldom static, intellectual, not ineffectual, fairly eventful, sometimes pitiful, over critical, unpredictable, semi-stable, fairly-able, unavailable

Push out the voltage, keep up the squeeze
Give me the credit with interest please
I'm here to borrow, I'm here to lend
I'm here to save and I'm here to spend

The numbers travel in electric trade
Men are broken, men are made
Cash and carry, dollars and yen
The world is bent then round again

If you believe in give and take
(Footsi-footsi)
And all the things that you can make
(Footsi-footsi)
In between the ins and outs
(Footsi-footsi)
Channeled life without a doubt

If you believe in give and take
And all the things that you can make
In between the ins and outs
Channeled life without a doubt

Give me the money, listen I care
Guilt edged horizons are under repair
I'm in the market, I'm in the chair
I've got a target, and I want my share

Leisure and plastic and medical mines
Mace and Chanel, breweries and wine
Public order, a coin of two sides
I'm ready to choose and I'm ready to fire

// Ticking Mouth //

Smiles like bullets, looks that could kill
Don't be caught with a hand in the thrill
Not always a matter of choice
And I hear a ticking in your voice

A numbing cold that weakens the will
A wining way that sweetens the pill
Not always a matter of choice
And I hear a ticking in your voice

Close together, we stand apart
Is that a ticking in your heart?
And I hear a ticking in your heart

A raging silence that lies cannot fill
A numbing cold that weakens the will
Not always a matter of choice
And I hear a ticking in your voice

Is that a ticking in your voice?

// It Continues //

It continues, it continues, it continues to escape me
It's not quite right the way you're trying to ape me
Observing my movements, trying to place me
I heard you'd laid plans to finally interface me

It's a cheerless thing, that thing you call a heart
That small black thing that's keeping us apart
Don't even think about it, don't you even try to start
I can see you in the corners, I can see you in the dark

It continues, it continues, it continues to escape me
It's not quite right, the way you're trying to implicate me

What would it be to know?
What would it be to have an answer?
Would it be worth your while?
Could it all end in disaster?

Standing in this garden just before the dawn
A place of amusement, an object of scorn
From the back of beyond to the front of the queue
From the change in the air, I knew it was you

It continues, it continues, it continues to escape me
It's not quite right the way you're trying to trace me

What would it be to know?
What would it be to have an answer?
Would it be worth your while?
Could it all end in disaster?

What would it be to know?
What would it be to have an answer?
Would it be worth your while?
Could it all end in disaster?

Don't you even think about it, don't you even try to start
I can see you in the corners, I can see you in the dark

It continues, it continues, it continues to escape me
It's not quite right they way you're trying to implicate me
Talking to my friends, trying to replace me
Picking up clues to finally trace me

Well, it continues, it continues, it continues to escape me
It's not quite right, the way you're trying to implicate me
It's a simple structure and if it falls apart
How would you replace it, where could you even start?

// Looking At Me (Stop!) //

Stop! If I've told you once, I've told you twice
And if I've told you twice, I've told you a thousand times
Just stop! I've give you an inch, but you've taken a mile
Stop! Don't do as I do, do as I say
Stop! It's under your nose. Stop!

It seems to me and it's written here
Not much fun but quite sincere
Information since received
Pardon me if I just breathe

Up down here there nowhere
Bus stop hope stop all flop
Up down here there nowhere
Bus stop hope stop all flop

It seems to me and I've always known
Something I have never owned
Information in progress
Leaves me cold, I do confess

Stop! The streets are filled with howling cheese
The two tailed dog tries hard to please
Sitting on its bag of fleas and barking at the noise of trees
It's under your nose

It seems to me there should have been
Someone who would intervene
Information here attached
Told us that he'd just been snatched

Stop! With a leg of mutton, D beats his wife in an everlasting life
Going to Heaven on a string, the piggers horse shoes ring. Stop!

// Naked, Whooping And Such-Like (Extended On And On) //

The rum-gagger was about to shake the bullet
He'd enough cat speak to make any wise man dumb, but on this occasion the cat was without claws and destined for hell
Was this where the chicken got the axe? And fuck, he'd only believed parrots deserved almonds...
Taking the dagger from the tall boy, he thought of drowning himself
The highway surveyor had played her ace against his jack
The gagger knew she's bulldoze a show of white feathers
She wasn't about to fear shaking her cloth in the wind
He tried to break a straw with her but blandiloquence drew a blank
Red, red against green
Red, red against green
He'd got ooperzootics on the brain
His father got them, caused the old git to run around the house, naked, whooping and such-like
One-armed, queer-gammed, and sharp as the corner of a square table
Warm as they come
He wore yellow stockings for his queen of the dripping pan
The highway surveyor's former handle
Goodyear's pig had forded the river a spit away
Peeled eyes were the order of the day
Above, sun-dodgers prepared to turn the black spotlight on

// Tailor Made //

Get on parade
Tailor made

Get on the parade, your place in the sun
Uniforms suit everyone
Made to measure, you'll like the shade
Fits like a glove, you're tailor made
Give them the slip, new suits are made
Full protection guaranteed
Your belief will be repaid
Target rich our techno trade

Reliable, reliable witness

In the room full of tame Mary's
It's hard to find the truth
If you ask me, "Is this normal?"
I'll say, "I've got the proof"

In the room full of tame Mary's
It's hard to find the truth
If you ask me, "Is it normal?"
You'll find me on the roof
(Searching for the truth)

Get on parade, a full display
Heed the warning, please don't delay
A shading of eyes, a turning of heads
A dig in the shallows, a collection of lead

// No Cows On The Ice //

Is it true? It's enough for you
Is it true? Or as before
Is it true? You still need more
Is it true? No marks are left
Is it true? Upon the snow
Is it true? No one will know

No cows on the ice
Every dog has its day
Whilst the cat's away
Blind mice will play

Can it be? Or is it true?
Can it be? There's nothing new
Can it be? It's new to me
Can it be? You milked the moon
Can it be? You jumped too soon
Can it be? You milked the moon

Is it true? Your days are long
And what was right has become wrong
In a room without a view
Your past slips by, no calls come through

// A Big Glue Canal //

A big glue canal, sweeping strain
Princess high, you scuzzy royal
The calendar reach of carbon daters
The lowest layers give the richest soup
Drop your guard, drink oyster dredge
Natives stroke long lost remains

Interrelating ideas
Diagnostic tools appear
Please oh please don't put it there
Bang, bang, bang you the killer bees
