// Here Comes The Cowboy //

Here comes the cowboy
Here comes the cowboy
Here comes the cowboy
Here comes the cowboy
Here comes the cowboy
Here comes the cowboy
Here comes the cowboy
Here comes the cowboy
Here comes the cowboy

Here comes the cowboy

// Nobody //

I'm a preacher
A done decision
Another creature
Has lost its vision

Let it go
Reel it in
For the creature
On television

There's no turning back
To nobody
There's no second chance
No third degree

I'm a fixture
A split decision
A pretty picture
A superstition

Let it go
Cash it in
For the creature
On television

There's no turning back
To nobody
There's no second chance
No third degree
There's no turning back
To nobody
There's no second chance
No third degree

// Finally Alone //

Sick of the city locked in with all the pretty people
Need a vacation somewhere that no one ever dreamt to go
Somewhere mundane, hop on the train see where it goes
Finish your ride, hop off and hide
Now that you're finally alone

Honey, you're finally alone

Out in the country tending to all the pretty cattle
Turns out the cowboy dreams of the city
Who could have ever known?
Hop on a plane, fly out to Spain, Int√©ntalo
Pick up your bags enjoy a jet lag
Now that you're finally alone

Honey, you're finally alone
Honey, you're finally alone
Honey, you're finally alone
Honey, you're finally alone

// Little Dogs March //

Hope you had your fun
All those days are over now
The sunset's at the skyline
Say goodnight and kindly take your bow

March on, little doggy
March on, little dog

Hope you got your fill
All those days are over now
The river's all dammed up
So fill your cup and kindly take your bow

And march on, little doggy
March on, little dog
March on, little doggy
March on, little dog

// Preoccupied //

Passin' around, you blacken your body
No conversation to ease up your mind
And nobody sings to see the outside of it

Preoccupied, and nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied, nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied, nobody's hiding it

Open your mind, filled it with bullshit
Locked up your heart, without even knowing it
It must be a sign, the days that we're living in

Preoccupied, and nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied, and nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied, nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied, yeah, and nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied, and nobody's hiding it

// Choo Choo //

Choo choo, take a ride with me
Choo choo, you can die with me
Choo choo, take a ride with me
Choo choo, come and die with me
Choo choo
Choo choo, come and die with me
Choo choo, choo choo, choo choo
You can die with me
Choo choo
Choo choo
Choo choo
Choo choo
Choo choo
Choo choo
Choo choo...

// K //

Has the years blown by, baby?
The more I come to know myself
The more it seems my love grows for you
You sure that I'd be dead, baby
Had I gone with someone else
For this and more, my love sold to you

K, anytime it feels as though my love has gone away
K, settle down, turn around, and take this song, and let it play

Got to know your heart, baby
Still so much for me to learn
And as I do, my love stays with you
You sure that I'd be done, baby
Had I made another turn
Glad the turn that I made was you

K, anytime it feels as though my love has gone away
K, settle down, turn around, and take this song, and let it play
K, anytime it feels as though my love has gone away
K, settle down, turn around, and take this song, and let it play

// Heart To Heart //

To all the days we were together
To all the time we were apart
Of each other's lives, heart to heart
And so I had a late arrival
So we never saw the start
Of each other's lives, heart to heart

Heart to heart, heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart

And though it seems so quick and easy
Sentimentally assumed
Walking parallels, heart to heart
To all the days we were together
To all the time we played apart
In each other's lives, heart to heart

Heart to heart, heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart

Weo! Weo! Weo! Weo!

// Hey Cowgirl //

Hey cowgirl
Hey cowgirl
Will you stay on the farm
Or will you come on back with me?
Hey cowgirl
Give up all of your stars to watch some TV
Hey cowgirl
What's it gonna be?
Hey cowgirl
Try the big city lights for a little while
Hey cowgirl
Sure as hell ain't no stars down the dairy aisle
Hey cowgirl
What's it gonna be?
Hey cowgirl
What's it gonna be?

// On The Square //

Brother's hands
This time it's in brother's hands
Baby are you satisfied
Is this all you had in mind

On the square
Live a life that isn't there
Square it up
Call me once you've had enough

Brother's hands
Feel the grip of brother's hands
Maybe it's been rectified
Locked outside and left to die

On the square
Live a life that isn't there
Square it up
Call me once you've had enough

On the square
Live a life that isn't there
Square it up
Call me once you've had enough

// All Of Our Yesterdays //

Holdin' out
Another day has come and let you down
All of our yesterdays have gone now
Tearin' up
Lookin' for a shoulder to prop you up
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone

And that don't mean your dream is over
And that don't make your heart beat slower
Such a shame to complain
When all of our yesterdays have gone away

Holdin' on
An image of a memory, another song
All of our yesterdays have gone now
Call me up
When you need a shoulder to prop you up
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone now
All of our yesterdays have gone

And that don't mean your dream is over
And that don't make your heart beat slower
Such a shame to complain
When all of our yesterdays have gone away
And that don't mean your dream is over
And that don't make your heart beat slower
Such a shame to complain
When all of our yesterdays have gone away

// Skyless Moon //

Baby blue
I know how things have changed for you
Remember that the days are numbered
Springtime turns to summer
With or without you
Little man
The autumn came and changed up your plans
Remember now their dead had gone
No one wants you singing along

More and more and more and more
More and more and more and more and more

Baby blue
I've been making changes too
Remember now the time's been spent up
There's no place left to rent out
There ain't much else for you to do
Skyless moon
Maybe spring will change up your tune
Remember now its dead had gone
Memories keep singing their songs

More and more and more and more and more
More and more and more and more and more
More and more and more and more and more
More and more and more and more and more

// Baby Bye Bye //

Another night
You don't sleep at all
You lay awake
Waiting for her call
But it never comes
And it never will
One more love to fall
Down from your windowsill

Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye

Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
(So long, darling)
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
(Woo)
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
Bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye
