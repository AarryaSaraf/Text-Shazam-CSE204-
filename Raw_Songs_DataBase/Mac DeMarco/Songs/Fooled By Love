I told her that I loved her
A little early on
There's no use left in crying
Honey, I've been fooled by love, this way before

There's no more conversation
No knocking at her door
There's no use in denying
Baby, I've been fooled by love, this way before

Why am I still crying?
There's no use left in crying
But I'm still out here crying
When I've been fooled by love before

No more early mornings
Waking up alone
And though it feels like dying
Honey, I've been fooled by love, this way before

I told her that I loved her
But what's it even for?
What's the use in crying?
Baby, I've been fooled by love, this way before

Why am I still crying?
There's no use left in crying
But I'm still out here crying
When I've been fooled by love before
