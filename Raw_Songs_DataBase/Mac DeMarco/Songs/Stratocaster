Stratocastor
Played me that one you used to play
Doesn't matter
My heart belongs to yesterday

Just
Me and you and moonlight
Me and you and moon
Your song ends too soon

Live below no master
And all of your troubles blow away
Hold my stratocastor
Play me that one we used to play

Just
Me and you and moonlight
Me and you and moon
Your song ends too soon
