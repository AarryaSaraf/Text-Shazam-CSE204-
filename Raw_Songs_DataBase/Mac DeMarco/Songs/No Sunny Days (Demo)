Talk about a total change of pace
Another day, another lonely face
Another town to kick your boots around in
Never time to learn a single phrase

Suddenly you're home and through your door
It's not the best, but best you can't afford
Wave and kiss goodbye to feeling lonely
A week or two at home and you'll want more

There's no sunny days in outer space
To watch all your tears
Drifting and floating away

Talk about a total change of heart
Handed out and fully ripped apart
Cheers to you for never breaking down
So surprised you ever came this far

Once you're home and settled in your bed
Don't act as though you've simply been misled
Let her know you love her if you do, boy
Let her know what's on the road ahead

There's no sunny days in outer space
To watch all your tears
Drifting and floating away
There's no sunny days in outer space
And truthfully told
I'd have it no other way
