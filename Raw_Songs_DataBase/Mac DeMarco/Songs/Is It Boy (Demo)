Exercise to stay alive
Another year has gone and passed you by
Waking up to coffee cup
Stretch it off, rip it up

When the old man gets to see it
He'll be whistling
All his worries away
And I know just how you see them
Keep believin'
That you'll find your foot someday

But you won't, will you boy
But no you won't, will you boy
It's not what you want, is it boy
It's not what you want

Exercise another way
To live your life, some other day ahead
Sleepin' in the day begins
You decide to rise up from your bed

When the old man gets to see it
Understand that all his dreamin' days are gone
And I hope now that you'll feel it
Your belief in all this nonsense is done

But it's not, is it boy
No it's not, is it boy
So take what you've got, can't you boy
Take what you've got
