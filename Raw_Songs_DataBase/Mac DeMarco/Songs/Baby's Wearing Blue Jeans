Standing on the corner, trying to keep it clean
A fine lookin' woman, in a pair of Lees
Take her back to my place, lay her down in bed
And after she's stripped down, I say leave 'em on instead

Baby's wearing blue jeans 
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans 
Baby's wearing blue jeans

I see you in the evening, keep 'em on in the tub
Washin wearing Wranglers, I think that I'm in love
Straight fit over bootcut, I'm begging down and please
Stay with me forever, don't take off those jeans

Baby's wearing blue jeans, baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans, baby's wearing blue jeans

Baby's wearing blue jeans 
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans
Baby's wearing blue jeans...
