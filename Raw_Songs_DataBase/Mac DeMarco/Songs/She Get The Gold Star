She get the gold star
The keys to my new car
The deed to my heart
Right from the start of it
Oh, how our love grove
Best one that I've known
But since you've been gone
I can't go on with it

But tomorrow
My baby's coming home
Tomorrow
I'll never, ever, ever let her go

She get the set up
She got me messed up
I give her my heart
She can take all of it
How much does love know
Of how much our love grows?
Just one day more
Till we get back to it

But tomorrow
My baby's coming home
Tomorrow
I'll never, ever, ever let her go
Tomorrow
My baby's coming home
Tomorrow
I'll never, ever, ever let her go

Ooh
Ya, ya
Cool, it's cool
It's cool
