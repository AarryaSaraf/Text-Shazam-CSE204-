When the lights come on, take the alley?
There's no driving drunk in the Valley
Sweet heart know
I'll be back around in a few years
Try some other town, sink a few beers
Sweet heart know

I'm the father of the year

Everything I've said has been bullshit
Went and settled down with some new kids
Sweet heart know
Shrug it off and make sure your tune's up
On a street with dimes and your tink up
Sweet heart know

I'm the father of the year
