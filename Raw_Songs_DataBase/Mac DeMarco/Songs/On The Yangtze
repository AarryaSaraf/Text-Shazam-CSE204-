Take a swim just you and me
On the yangtze
Take a dip try a sip
Of the yangtze

Havin' fun out in the sun
On the yangtze
Chores are done nowhere to run
On the yangtze

And so we see a captain
Skimmin' down the shoreline
He asks if we're chilly
And we tell him, cap' we're just fine

Dippin' in its love again
On the yangtze
Swimmin' down we're passin' towns
On the yangtze

Crystal clear the hills are here
On the yangtze
Dippin' in it's love again
On the yangtze

And so we see a young girl
Standin' at the shoreline
She asks if we're happy
And I tell her girl, we're havin' a great time
