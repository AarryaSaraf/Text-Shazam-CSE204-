(One two three four)
Trouble believing
What's been going on
Find yourself a new home
Who knows for how long

Is it wrong to feel afraid
Of things that don't affect you know
But surely will someday?
Is it wrong to try to change
The style of your conversation
Just to get your way

These troubles I'm seeing
These days I don't know what to believe in

Trouble believing
Anything you're told
Nothing is much easier
Only that you've grown

Getting harder now to tell
What's right from wrong by yourself
Getting harder now to see
No one ever understands just what you need

These troubles I'm seeing
These days I don't know what to believe in
These troubles I'm seeing
These days I don't know what to believe in
