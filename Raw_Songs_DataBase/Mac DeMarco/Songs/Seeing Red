(One, Two Three)

The blood's on your hands
Your heart's in your mouth
Chew and spit out
Baby

It's hard to recall, there's no denying it
The bird's in your head, you're busy flying it
Oh, oh, oh
You've been seeing red

The gun's in your mouth
Finger on the the trigger
Which man turns out victor?
Baby

It's hard to recall, there's no denying it
The bird's in your head, you're busy flying it
No need to recall, there's no denying it
The bird's in your head, you're busy flying it
Oh, oh, oh
You've been seeing red
