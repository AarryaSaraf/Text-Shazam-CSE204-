Passin' around, you blacken your body
No conversation to ease up your mind
And nobody sings to see the outside of it

Preoccupied, and nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied, nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied, nobody's hiding it

Open your mind, filled it with bullshit
Locked up your heart, without even knowing it
It must be a sign, the days that we're living in

Preoccupied, and nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied, and nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied, nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied, yeah, and nobody's hiding it
Preoccupied, and nobody's hiding it
