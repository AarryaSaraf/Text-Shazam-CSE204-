// D.A.N.C.E. //

Do the D-A-N-C-E
1, 2, 3, 4, fight
Stick to the B-E-A-T
Get ready to ignite
You were such a P-Y-T
Catching all the lights
Just easy as A-B-C
That's how you make it right

Do the D-A-N-C-E

Just easy as A-B-C
That's how you make it right

Do the D-A-N-C-E

Under the spotlights
Neither black nor white
It doesn't matter
Do the dance, do the dance

As strong as you might
Working day and night
Whatever happens
Do the dance, do the dance

Under the spotlights
Neither black nor white
It doesn't matter
Do the dance, do the dance

As strong as you might
Working day and night
Whatever happens
Do the dance, do the dance

The way you move is a mystery
Do the dance
You're always there for music and me

The way you move is a mystery

Let me tell you what I do when my day is over.
After picking the right clothes for about an hour.
Oooh, I'm turning orange from all the karats around my neck.
Tonight, I'm takin' out the bling and I'm dressed to impress.

I'm gettin' ready for my night out on the town.
I'm lookin' hot cause you know we are holdin' it down.
Rockin' high-tops and sayin' no to stilettos.
Cause I might get drunk off my ass and I don't wanna fall.

Out on the streets all the taxis are showin' me love.
'Cause I shinin' like a princess, in the middle of thugs.
And at the clubs, the bouncers recognize my face.
So while you waitin in the line, we just enter the place.

Let's get this party started right,
Let's get drunk and freaky fly,
You with me so it's all right,
We gonna stay up the whole night.

Let's get this party started right,
Let's get drunk and freaky fly (ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eyyyy)

I'm callin' all my ladies at the table 3.
Throwin' back a couple bottles and the tab's on me.
Havin' some giggles then we start to get crazy
Table dancin', smashin' glasses, it starts to get naughty.

Now we all ready to head out of the VIP
I'm lookin' good and I can feel that all eyes are on me
Its time to show em' how we do on the floor
So while the DJ play my track I want my girls on the floor
Now you know I made an anthem for all my hot chicks.
And I ain't about how we girls are raisin' your dicks.
I got the surround sound so why ya wanna see me? Fuck,
I'm just tryin' to have a blast and I ain't takin' your call.

Let's get this party started right,
Let's get drunk and freaky fly,
You with me so it's alright,
We gonna stay up the whole night.

Let's get this party started right,
Let's get drunk and freaky fly (ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eyyyy)

You know all the fliest ladies are on my team
And we know how to meet the hags that'll fuckin' scream
We gettin' ugly in the club, we look a little trashed
But all the ballers in the club know we got that class

I'm bringing the weirdest cool at the after party 
Just got in the hotel room and this is gettin started
Better wake the fuck up cuz were not here to sleep 
Uffie is hyped up in this bitch and I'm bangin' that beat

No you and you, c'mon lets take it to the next level.
Let's all go to the hotel pool as we finish the bottle.
Baby kiss and don't tell, it's the rule around here.
You must have me under a spell I lose control when you're near.

Let's get this party started right,
Let's Get drunk and freaky fly,
You with me so its alright,
We gonna stay up the whole night. (x3)

Let's get this party started right,
Let's get drunk and freaky fly (ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey-eyyyy)

It's always the same
Always ashamed storytelling
When I can come in
To a hopeless troglodyte 
But one more time my answer stood
I swear I mean no offense
But you better learn to read
It's all about membership

Spelling it for the young and old
Ugly girls and boys
I put you on my list
And make you clap to this 
Is it mayhem or just an ego trip?
But only one can win
And soon you'll say that hymn

Four capital letters
Printed in gold
'Cause details make the girls sweat even more
While they're shaking their belts
No need to ask my name to figure out how cool I am

No need to ask my name to figure out how cool I am

Can anyone read? Anyone feel?
That I'm losing my patience
I just came here to bounce
Ladies are all waxed
They all know I'm coming
I'm losing my patience
I just came here to bounce
