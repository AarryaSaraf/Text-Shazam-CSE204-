There's a tear in my beer 
'cause I'm cryin' for you, dear 
you are on my lonely mind. 
Into these last nine beers 
I have shed a million tears. 
You are on my lonely mind
I'm gonna keep drinkin'
until I'm petrified.
And then maybe these tears 
will leave my eyes.
There's a tear in my beer 
cause I'm crying' for you dear
You are on my lonely mind.

Last night I walked the floor
and the night before
You are on my lonely mind.
It seems my life is through
and I'm so doggone blue
You are on my lonely mind.
I'm gonna keep drinkin'
till I can't move a toe
and then maybe my heart
won't hurt me so.
There's a tear in my beer
cause I'm cryin' for you dear
You are on my lonely mind.

Lord, I've tried and I've tried
But my tears I can't hide
You are on my lonely mind.
All these blues that I've found
Have really got me down
You are on my lonely mind
I'm gonna keep drinkin' till I can't even think
Cause in the last week I ain't slept a wink
There's a tear in my beer
cause I'm crying for you dear
You are on my lonely mind.
