I'm dreaming tonight of Dixie cotton fields and Whippoorwills 
Where I used to live and wander through the rocks and through the rivs 
I can see my old dear mammy while around the place she'd go
On my farm in Louisiana where the old Red River flows

Ayyy deeeeee dooooloooooooooo

You can hear those darkies crooning soft and low 
And the twilight in the evening so loooooo so soft and loooooooo

On my farm in Louisiana where the old Red River flows 

Well the lights tonight on Broadway electric lights shine bright as day 
On the beach at Coney Island where the laughter makes you gay 
But I'm going back tonight love on the icy wind she goes
To my farm in Louisiana where the old Red River flows

Ayyy deeeeee dooooloooooooooo

You can hear those darkies crooning soft and low 
And the twilight in the evening so loooooo so soft and loooooooo

On my farm in Louisiana where the old Red River flows
