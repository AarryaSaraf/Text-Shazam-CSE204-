Oh don't you know that Jesus died to wash your sins away
Please heed His call and in sin don't fall
We're getting closer to the grave each day
They nailed his hands there on the cross
On His head the thorns did lay
Be prepared to go, there's one thing I know
We're getting closer to the grave each day
Sinner man won't you stop now and pray
Leave the road of sin alone
Let Jesus lead you home
We're getting closer to the grave each day
