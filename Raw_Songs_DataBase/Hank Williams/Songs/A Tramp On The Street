Only a tramp was lazarus sad fate
He who lay down at the rich mans gate
He begged for the crumbs from the rich man to eat
He was only a tramp found dead on the street.
he was some mothers darlin, he was some	mothers son
Once he was fair and once he was young
And some mother rocked him, her darlin to sleep
But they left him to die like a tramp on the street.
jesus, he died on calvarys tree
He shed his lifes blood for you and for me
They pierced his side and then his feet
And they left him to die like a tramp on the street.
he was marys own darlin, he was gods chosen son
Once he was fair and once he was young
Mary, she rocked him, her darlin to sleep

Then the gods would deny you on the great judgement day.
