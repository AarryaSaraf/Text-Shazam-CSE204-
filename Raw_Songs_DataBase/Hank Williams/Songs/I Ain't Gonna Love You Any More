No need for you to set alone,
just waiting by your telephone
Cause I ain't gonna call you any more.
Oh I gave you love and you broke my heart,
And you cheated on me from the start.
And now I ain't gonna love you anymore.


I mean I ain't gonna love you anymore,
I know I couldn't love you as before.
So I'm gonna tell you goodbye,
Don't mind these tears there in my eyes
Cause I ain't gonna love you anymore

My darlin' I just worship you,
and look what you have loved me thru.
You left me with a heart so sick and sore.
Oh you're the one that was unfair,
It wasn't in you to play square.
And now I ain't gonna love you anymore.
