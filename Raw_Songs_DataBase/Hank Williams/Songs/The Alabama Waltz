I was sad and blue, I was down-hearted, too
It seemed like the whole world was lost
And I took a chance, and we happened to dance
To the tune of the ALABAMA WALTZ.


Waltz, Waltz, the ALABAMA WALTZ
There all my fears and tears were lost
There in your arms, with all of your charms
We danced to the ALABAMA WALTZ.
