In Life's many battles that you will have to fight
Just stay close to Jesus and journey in His light
Then on that judgement morning when all pain has fled
You'll stand in God's Kingdom, When The Book Of Life Is Read.

When the seals are broken and names are read aloud
You'll see many loved ones standin' in the crowd
So brother keep on prayin' and follow where you're lead
You'll stand in God's Kingdom, When The Book Of Life Is Read.

All your dreams of heaven will come true on that day
When the sky shall open and this earth melt away
Then all God's faithful children will raise up from the dead
United in God's Kingdom, When The Book Of Life Is Read.

What a happy feelin' to know He'll always care
And when our work is over heaven with Him we'll share
There's be no pain or sorrow, no tears will e'er be shed
When we stand there in God's Kingdom and The Book Of Life Is Read.
