Standin' by, a lonesome graveyard
Everything I love is gone
Weeping as, they lay my darlin'
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

In this world, I'm left to wander, with no one to call my own
And the one I love is sleepin'
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

Skies above, were dark and stormin'
For the sunshine all has gone
And the one I love is sleepin'
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone

My heart's dead, and yet I'm livin'
Wanderin' through this world alone
I wish that I was with my darlin'
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone
'Neath a cold gray tomb of stone
