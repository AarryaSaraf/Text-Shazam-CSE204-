Tis a sad but true story from the Bible it came
And it tells us how Judas sold the Savior in shame
He planned with the council of high priest that day
30 pieces of silver was the price they would pay

30 pieces of silver 30 shackles of shame
Was the price paid for Jesus on the cross he was slain
Betrayed and forsaken unloved and unclaimed
In anger they pierced him but he died not in vain

T'was on there on the hillside the multitude came
And found our dear Savior then took him away
They bruised and they mocked him thorns was crowned around his head
And his garment of purple showed the blood stains of red

Far off in the mountains with his face towards the sun
Judas begged mercy for what he had done
He gave back the silver for his heart filled with strife
Then there in the mountain he took his own life

30 pieces of silver 30 shackles of shame
Was the price paid for Jesus on the cross he was slain
