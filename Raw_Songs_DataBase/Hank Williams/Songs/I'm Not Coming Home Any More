When you get home there you will find
This letter dear that I have wrote to you
And when you read it oe'r
Till then you'll understand
Why I'm not coming home anymore

Oh there ain't no use to cry
Because we're saying goodbye
We have discussed that oe'r and oe'r
So you go your way to you may life be kind
For I'm not coming home anymore

Darling we were so happy and had a happy home
The baby we were so proud of you
But then you went astray
I'll never forget that day
For him to know I'd much rather be dead

When from you I'm far away 
I'll long for you each day 
The baby I will miss him so
But from you I will go
For it's all over so
I'm not coming home anymore

Oh there ain't no use to cry
Because we're saying goodbye
We have discussed that oe'r and oe'r
So you go your way to you may life be kind
For I'm not coming home anymore
