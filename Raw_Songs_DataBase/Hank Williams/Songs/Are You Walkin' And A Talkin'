On your journey to the grave
would you stop and try to save
Are you walkin and a-talkin with the lord? 
Would you lend a helping hand
to some poor sinner man
Are you walkin and a-talkin with the lord? 


Are you walkin, (are you walkin)
are you talkin, (are you talkin)
Are you walkin and a-talkin with the lord? 
Are you traveling in his light
every day and every night
Are you walkin and a talkin with the lord? 
If you heart said testify, would the world hear your reply
Are you walkin and a-talkin with the lord?
Would you stand and shout his name or bow your head in shame
Are you walkin and a-talkin with the lord? 



Are you walkin and a-talkin with the lord? 
Will he take you by the hand and lead you to that promised land
Are you walkin and a-talkin with the lord?
