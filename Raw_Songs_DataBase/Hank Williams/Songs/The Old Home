I went to the old home
Where I once use to roam
And all of my friend's
Had everyone gone

How sad, And how drear
No voice did I hear
There was no one
To welcome me home

No one, to welcome me home
Oh no, no one, to welcome me home
How sad and how drear
No voice could I hear
There was no one, to welcome me home

I went to the old school
Where I once loved to play
And all of my playmates
Had everyone gone

So lonesome and drear
No voice did I hear
There was no one
To welcome me home

No one, to welcome me home
There was no one, to welcome me home
But when I behold
That mansion of gold
There'll be someone, to welcome me home
