LORD I WENT TO THE DOCTOR, HE TOOK ONE LOOK,
HE SAID THE TROUBLE WITH YOU AIN'T IN MY BOOK,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS BUT IT AIN'T GOOD NEWS,
YOU'VE GOT AN AWFUL BAD CASE OF THEM LOW DOWN BLUES.


I'VE GOT THE MEAN OLD MISERIES IN MY SOUL,
I WENT TO THE RIVER, BUT THE WATER'S TOO COLD,
I'VE WALKED THE FLOOR 'TILL I'VE WORE OUT MY SHOES,
LORD THEY'RE KILLIN' ME, I MEAN THEM LOW DOWN BLUES.

LORD I NEVER KNEW A MAN COULD FEEL SO BAD,
I NEVER KNEW LIVIN' COULD BE SO SAD,
ALL I DO IS SET AND CRY,
LORD I'D HAVE TO GET BETTER, BEFORE I COULD DIE.
