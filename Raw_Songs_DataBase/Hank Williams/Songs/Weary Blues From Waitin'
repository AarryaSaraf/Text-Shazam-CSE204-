Weary blues from waitin'
Lord, I've been waitin' too long
These blues have got me  cryin'

The snow falls 'round my window
But it can't chill my heart
God knows it died the day you left
My dream world fell a part.

Weary blues from waitin'
Lord, I've been waitin' too long
These blues have got me  cryin'

Thru tears I watch young lovers
As they go strollin' by
Oh, all the things that might have been
God forgive me if I cry.

Weary blues from waitin'
Lord, I've been waitin' too long
These blues have got me  cryin'
