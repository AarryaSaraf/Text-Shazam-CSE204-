You were there in my arms alone in the moonlight
The trees played the waltz of the wind
It was there I knew I'd love you forever
As we danced to the waltz of the wind

The stars up above you look down in your eyes 
And there in the moonlight I knew
So I'll say goodbye dear till tomorrow
Till we dance to the waltz of the wind
