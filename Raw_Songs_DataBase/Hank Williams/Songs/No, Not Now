TOOK MY GAL TO THE PICTURE SHOW, JUST THE OTHER DAY,
BUT WHEN I TRIED TO HOLD HER HAND,
HERE'S WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY.


NO NOT NOW, (no not now), NO NOT NOW, (no not now),
NO NOT NOW, BUT MAYBE NEXT WEEK SOME - HOW.

WALKED MY GAL HOME TO THE DOOR, AND ASKED HER FOR A KISS,
BUT SHE QUICKLY TURNED AWAY, AND THEN SHE TOLD ME THIS.



I ASKED MY GAL TO MARRY ME, RECKON WHAT SHE SAID,
SHE SAID I WOULDN'T MARRY YOU, IF ALL THE REST WERE DEAD.



BUT SHE WENT AND CHANGED HER MIND, HOW I REGRET THAT DAY,
'CAUSE EVERY SINCE I MARRIED HER, HERE'S ALL THAT SHE CAN SAY.
 (YOU GUESSED IT!)



I STAYED OUT TOO LATE LAST NIGHT, ON A LITTLE SPREE,
AND WHEN I ASKED HER TO LET ME IN, HERE'S ALL SHE SAID TO ME.
 (HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID)
