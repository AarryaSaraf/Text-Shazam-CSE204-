I told my heart I didn't love you
That I'd be happy if we'd part
But now I know I was mistaken
I Told A Lie To My Heart.

I told my heart I didn't love you
Now we'll forever be apart
Lonely years of tears and sorrow
I Told A Lie To My Heart.

If we sin somehow we pay
And now the bitter teardrops start
I must learn to live without you
I Told A Lie To My Heart.

I told my heart I didn't love you
That I'd be happy if we'd part
Lonely years of tears and sorrow
I Told A Lie To My Heart.
