// I'm Gonna Git You Sucka //

Whether or not
You know you on the
Eve of destruction
It don't take no Einstein
To figure out that

Well, ya been keepin' them hotties
Slippin' and slidin'
Livin' it big
Sellin' that crack
And that's a natural fact

Well
I'm gonna git you, sucka
Dirty mutha...
(Don't you say that!)
I'm gonna teach you
That crime just don't pay

I'm gonna git you, sucka
Dirty mutha...
(Don't you say that!)
I'm gonna stay on your case
Till they put you away

I know you think that life's
A bowl of cherries
And you can absolutely
Do no wrong

A-Big brother
A word from the wise
Should be sufficient
So I suggest you pay
Close attention to the words
To this song

Woo!
Gold fever
Gold fever
Changin' things
Changin' things

Livin' in the fast lane
Beating up the street kids
Got plenty money to burn

World's a game of double cross
Till you became the boss, now
It's my turn

Get so we don't agree
Menace to society
Smile, yeah, you're on top

'Cause a smile is just
A frown turned upside down
Get ready for the
Big drop
'Cause

I'm gonna git you sucka
Dirty mutha...
(Don't you say that!)
I'm gonna stay on your case
Till they put you away

I know you think that life's
A bowl of cherries
And you can absolutely
Do no wrong

A-Big brother
A word from the wise
Should be sufficient
So I suggest you pay
Close attention to the words
To this song
Woo!

I'm gonna git you sucka
Dirty mutha...
(I ain't gonna tell you again!)
I'm gonna teach you
That crime just don't pay
Hey!

I'm gonna git you sucka
Dirty mutha...
(Oh! You grown now, huh?)
I'm gonna stay on your case
Till they put you away

Baby
I'm gonna git you sucka
Dirty mutha...
(Don't you say that!)
I'm gonna teach you
That crime just don't pay

Ooh-wee
I'm gonna git you sucka
Dirty mutha...
(Boy, I'll slap you down!)
I'm gonna stay on your case
Till they put you away

Doo-doo-doo
I'm gonna git you sucka
Dirty mutha...
(You on my last nerve!)
I'm gonna teach you
That crime just don't pay

Ooh-wee
I'm gonna git you sucka
Dirty mutha...
(Don't you say that!)
I'm gonna stay on your case
Till they put you away

// No Colour Lines //

Ooh why 
Oh why
Why does love hate?
Why do we segregate?
Can we consummate?
Why do we separate?
Love can conquer hate
My friend it's not too late
Why contemplate?
It's time to celebrate

Love conquers all
It's the missing thing
That everybody needs 
It's like a breath of spring
And if we love, love and make peace
Let all this hatred cease
Colour has no place in peace

Hear these words I say
My friend we're on our way
To a brighter day
Love will lead the way

The colour lines are gone
It's time to right our wrongs
Listen to this song
Those days have all darn gone

No colour lines 
No colour lines
Open up your eyes
Your hearts and your minds
Then we will find
We as people all are blind
We're running out of time
You'll see
We're all the same there's no colour lines
Nooo
Ohhh
No no no no no no no no
There are no colour lines
(There is no white or black, black or white, red yellow or brown)
No no no no no no no no no no

No colour lines
No colour lines
Open up your eyes
Your hearts and your minds
Then we will find we as people all are blind
We're running out of time
You'll see
Were all the same there is no colour lines
Were all the same there is no colour lines
Were all the same there is no colour lines

No colour lines
