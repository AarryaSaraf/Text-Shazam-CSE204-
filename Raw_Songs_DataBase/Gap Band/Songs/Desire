You ought to do something to make a living
'Cause I have desire, desire...

Desire!
Desire!
Desire!
Desire!

You give me that desire
Work hard all night long
You give me that desire
Keep me goin' strong

I don't mind workin'
Seven days a week
When I come home to you
I know you're gonna treat me sweet

Desire keeps me goin' strong
Desire keeps me burnin' like a red hot fire

I really don't mind, girl
I don't mind workin' hard
When I come home, girl
I know I'll get my reward

Desire keeps me goin' strong
Desire keeps me burnin' like a red hot fire

Desire

You're my inspiration
Will you keep me, please?
Never run from love, babe
Give me all I need

I remember what you told me
The sweet words in my ear
Each time you love me
I know what I wanna hear

Desire keeps me goin' strong
Desire keeps me burnin' like a red hot fire

Desire
Desire

Do-do-do-do-do-do, desire
Do-do-do-do-do-do, desire

Desire keeps me goin' strong
Desire keeps me burnin' like a red hot fire

Desire, desire

Desire keeps me goin' strong
Desire keeps me burnin' like a red hot fire

Desire keeps me goin' strong
Desire keeps me burnin' like a red hot fire
