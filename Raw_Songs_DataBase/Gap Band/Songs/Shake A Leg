Oh, you left me
With the feelings in my hand
You gave me my papers back
Now I am a free man

So you know that coming back
It's not a part of the plan
What do you think of me
I am a free man, baby

Oh, you left me
At the wrong time
She was a devil in disguise
'Cause she was so fine

You thought you could make me beg
Baby, I'm gonna shake a leg, mmm...
Shake a leg, shake a leg, mm-hmm
Shake a leg, mmm...
Shake a leg, shake a leg

Oh, you left me
At the wrong time
She was a devil in disguise
'Cause she was so fine

You thought you were coming back
But that ain't part of my plan
What do you think of that
I'm now a free man, baby

You said you love me, babe
It was part of the plan
First you said you'll be right by my side
I try to do all I can

You thought you could make me beg
But, baby, I'm gonna
Shake a leg, shake a leg
Shake a leg, shake a leg, mmm...
Shake a leg, shake a leg, mmm...
Shake a leg, shake a leg, baby

Shake a leg, shake a leg, mmm...
Shake a leg, shake a leg
Shake a leg, shake a leg, mmm...
Shake a leg, shake a leg, baby

Shake a leg, shake a leg
Shake a leg, shake a leg
Shake a leg, shake a leg
Shake a leg, shake a leg
Shake a leg

Shake a leg, shake a leg
Shake a leg, shake a leg, whoo!
Shake a leg, shake a leg
Shake a leg, shake a leg, yeah

Shake a leg, shake a leg, oh...
Shake a leg, shake a leg
Shake a leg, shake a leg, baby, hey
Shake a leg, shake a leg

You burned the fire on me
I'm gonna make you see!
Shake a leg, shake a leg...
