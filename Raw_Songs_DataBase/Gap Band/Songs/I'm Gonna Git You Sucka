Whether or not
You know you on the
Eve of destruction
It don't take no Einstein
To figure out that

Well, ya been keepin' them hotties
Slippin' and slidin'
Livin' it big
Sellin' that crack
And that's a natural fact

Well
I'm gonna git you, sucka
Dirty mutha...
(Don't you say that!)
I'm gonna teach you
That crime just don't pay

I'm gonna git you, sucka
Dirty mutha...
(Don't you say that!)
I'm gonna stay on your case
Till they put you away

I know you think that life's
A bowl of cherries
And you can absolutely
Do no wrong

A-Big brother
A word from the wise
Should be sufficient
So I suggest you pay
Close attention to the words
To this song

Woo!
Gold fever
Gold fever
Changin' things
Changin' things

Livin' in the fast lane
Beating up the street kids
Got plenty money to burn

World's a game of double cross
Till you became the boss, now
It's my turn

Get so we don't agree
Menace to society
Smile, yeah, you're on top

'Cause a smile is just
A frown turned upside down
Get ready for the
Big drop
'Cause

I'm gonna git you sucka
Dirty mutha...
(Don't you say that!)
I'm gonna stay on your case
Till they put you away

I know you think that life's
A bowl of cherries
And you can absolutely
Do no wrong

A-Big brother
A word from the wise
Should be sufficient
So I suggest you pay
Close attention to the words
To this song
Woo!

I'm gonna git you sucka
Dirty mutha...
(I ain't gonna tell you again!)
I'm gonna teach you
That crime just don't pay
Hey!

I'm gonna git you sucka
Dirty mutha...
(Oh! You grown now, huh?)
I'm gonna stay on your case
Till they put you away

Baby
I'm gonna git you sucka
Dirty mutha...
(Don't you say that!)
I'm gonna teach you
That crime just don't pay

Ooh-wee
I'm gonna git you sucka
Dirty mutha...
(Boy, I'll slap you down!)
I'm gonna stay on your case
Till they put you away

Doo-doo-doo
I'm gonna git you sucka
Dirty mutha...
(You on my last nerve!)
I'm gonna teach you
That crime just don't pay

Ooh-wee
I'm gonna git you sucka
Dirty mutha...
(Don't you say that!)
I'm gonna stay on your case
Till they put you away
