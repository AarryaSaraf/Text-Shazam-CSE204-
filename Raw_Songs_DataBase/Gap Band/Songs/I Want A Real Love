I want a real love
Don't want someone to play with
I want a real love, oh...
I want a true love
Not just another teaser
I want a real love

True love is hard to find
Infatuation can rob you blind
It's time I leave it all behind
I've reached the point in my life
My future's on the line

I want a real love
Don't want someone to play with
I want a real love, oh...
I want a true love
Not just another teaser
I want a real love

I've come a long, long way
But I still got a long way to go
Now you say you wanna journey with me, lady
Well, I think it's only fair
That I let you know

I want a real love, oh-whoa-whoa...
I want a real love, oh-whoa-whoa...
I want a real love, oh-whoa-whoa...
I want a real love, oh-whoa-whoa...
Yeah, yeah

Oh, girl
Be my lady
I wanna say it just one more time

I want a real love, oh-whoa-whoa...
I want a real love, oh-whoa-whoa...
I want a real love, oh-whoa-whoa...
I want a real love, oh-whoa-whoa...

I want a real love, oh-whoa-whoa...
I want a real love, baby, oh-whoa-whoa...
I want a real love, yeah, oh-whoa-whoa...
I want a real love, baby, oh-whoa-whoa...
