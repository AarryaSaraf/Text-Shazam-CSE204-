Standin' back, on the wall
Lookin' so pretty, you're the best of all
See the smile, written on your face
I know you wanna dance girl
Why would you wait

It's our duty
To make you dance, little cutie
It's our duty
To make you dance, little cutie

It's time we got you, on the floor
We're gonna hold this groove, 'til you want some more
Just feel the rhythm and the beat
Do your dance, girl, move your feet

Tonight's the night
We'll make you feel alright
Do your boogie, in the shining lights
Don't you make us sweat or work so hard
We're doing ours, now will you do your part?

It's our duty
To make you dance, little cutie
It's our duty
To make you dance, little cutie

All you party people just say
"Oh, oh, oh-oh"
"Oh, oh, oh-oh"

Tonight's the night
