I'm living on my memories
I'm drifting on my dreams
It's not so unusual
It's not as strange as it seems

Remembering my yesterdays
And the times from the past
It almost reminds one, yeah
Of seeing life through a looking glass, oh...

I believe you gotta need me
Need me or I won't be around, no
I believe you gotta need me
Need me or I won't be around, no

I'm sharing my memories
Sharing all, sharing all my dreams
With you 'cause you're special, yeah, yeah
Oh, baby, do you know what I mean

I believe you gotta need me
Need me or I won't be around, no
I believe you gotta need me
Need me or I won't be around, no

I believe you gotta need me
Need me or I won't be around
No, no, no, no, no, no
I believe you gotta need me
Need me or I won't be around
No, no, no

I believe
If you really love me
You're gonna need me
And I won't be around, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
(Some, some girls like diamonds)
I believe
You're gonna need me
Need me or I won't be around
