It is no secret 'bout the way I feel
This feeling is for real
I wish that I could find the words to say
I tell you everyday

You are my sun, you're my star
You're everything to me
You are my pride and my joy
Oh, girl, you are my everything
You're my girl, you're my everything

It is no secret 'bout the way I feel
This feeling is for real

Oh, girl, you're everything to me
You're my world, you're my everything
