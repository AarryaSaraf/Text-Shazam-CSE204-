You, you by my side
I'll conquer the world
You'll be my guiding light, mmm...
You, you by my side
We'll spend all our days
Erasing those lonely nights

You, you are my high, oh...
You, you are my high, ooh, baby
You, you are my high
Till the end of time

You, you by my side
I'll conquer the world
You'll be my guiding light, oh-oh...
You, you by my side
We'll spend all our days
Erasing those lonely nights

You, you are my high, oh...
You, you are my high, oh, baby
You, you are my high
Till the end of time

Yeah

Oh, you, you are my high, ooh, baby
You, you are my high, oh, baby
You, you are my high
Till the end of time

You, you by my side
I'll conquer the world
You'll be my guiding light
You, you'll be by my side
I'll spend all my days
Erasing all those lonely nights

You, you by my side
I'll spend all my days
Erasing all those lonely nights
You, you are my high
Till the end of time
