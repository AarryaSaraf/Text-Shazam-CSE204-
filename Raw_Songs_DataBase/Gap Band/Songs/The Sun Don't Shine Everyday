What's wrong?
Why are you crying?
Aw...
Aw, you know the sun don't shine everyday

A lonely smile on your face
A broken heart that can't be replaced
The sun don't shine everyday
Ooh, little girl
The sun don't shine everyday, yeah
Ooh, little girl
The sun don't shine everyday

A lonesome tear on your face
From the rain, from the rain
That has long gone away
A cloud that was left behind
Only the sun can erase
Little girl, little girl, don't cry
'Cause you know
That the sun don't shine everyday
Mmm, little girl, little girl
The sun don't shine everyday

A lonely smile, a broken heart
A shattered mind, a shattered mind
That you left behind
A cloud that the sun could only erase
Little girl, little girl, little girl
The sun don't shine everyday
Mmm-mm, I said, little boy
Little girl, little boy
(Little girl, little boy)
(Little girl, little boy)
The sun don't shine everyday

Lift your face and smile
'Cause a shattered mind
Will take you back in time
Lift your face and smile
'Cause a shattered mind
Will take you back in time
Take you back in time, back in time
Little girl, little boy, little girl
The sun don't shine

I said, lift your face and smile
'Cause a shattered mind
Will take you back in time
The sun don't shine
Little girl, little boy
The sun don't shine everyday
The sun don't shine everyday...
