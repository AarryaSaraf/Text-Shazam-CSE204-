Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sometimes you're up and sometimes you're down
You can't go runnin' with your feet off the ground
Sometimes you're right, sometimes you're wrong
In this world, situations make you very strong

Keep the faith, never bend, be yourself to the end
Don't look back, keep your head towards the sky
Life works out in the sweet by and by
While you give life everything you've got, mm-hmm

Are you living in a bad situation
What you giving, are you giving everything you got
Makes you wonder, wonder do you know who you are
Are you giving life everything you got

Are you living in a bad situation
What you giving, are you giving everything you got

Hey, hey, whoo!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sometimes I'm up and sometimes I'm down
I can't go runnin' with your feet off the ground
Sometimes I'm right but sometimes I'm wrong
Situations makes me very strong

Keep the faith, never bend, be yourself to the end
Don't look back, keep your head towards the sky
Life works out in the sweet by and by
Are you giving life, giving life
