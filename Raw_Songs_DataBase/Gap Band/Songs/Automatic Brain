Deep in the land, there is funk
Music has no alternative to stop
But there's a woman that walks around
And when she gets down, this woman has
Automatic, an automatic brain
An automatic brain

Uh! She has an automatic brain
Uh! The kind that drives you insane
Uh! She has an automatic brain
Ah! The kind that drives you insane

The girl has a personality
She make you wanna scream
The girl, the way she walks
In designer jeans
She make you wanna wiggle
She make you wanna talk
But when she shakes her body
She make you wanna walk, watch out!

Uh! She has an automatic brain
Uh! The kind that drives you insane
Hear me out
Oh! She has an automatic brain
Ah! The kind that drives you insane
Hear my now

She has an automatic
Au-automatic, automatic-tic brain
She has an automatic
Au-automatic, automatic-tic brain

She has an automatic
Au-automatic, automatic-tic brain
She has an automatic
Au-automatic-matic brain
(Deep in the land, there's funk)

Uh! Uh!
(Yeah, oh, yeah)
Uh! Ah!
(Oh, yeah, oh, yeah!)
Uh! Ah!
Uh! Ah!
(Deep in the land, there's funk)
Uh!

Deep in the land, there's funk

Uh! She has an automatic brain
Uh! The kind that drives you insane
Hear me out
Uh! She has an automatic brain
Ah! She gonna drive you insane
(Deep in the land, there's funk)

Uh! She has an automatic brain
Uh! The kind that drives you insane
Uh! She has an automatic brain
Uh! She gonna drive you insane
(Deep in the land, there's funk)
Sing it, fellas!

She has an automatic
Au-automatic, automatic-tic brain
She has an automatic
Au-automatic, automatic-tic brain
(Deep in the land, there's funk)

She has an automatic
Au-automatic, automatic-tic brain
She has an automatic
(She has an automatic brain)
Au-automatic, automatic-tic brain
(Uh! The girl drive you insane)

Uh! The girl is fine
Trust me, hon'
Uh! The girl is fine
The way she walks
And wiggles behind...
