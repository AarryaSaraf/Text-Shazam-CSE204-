One fat hen, a couple of ducks
Three brown bears, four running hares
Five fat Emilies
(You gonna dance)
Six simple Simons sittin' on a stump
Seven Siamese sailors sailin' the seven seas
Eight egotistical egotists
Eekin' in and out of existence
Nine nibblin' nibblin' Nubians
Nibblin' nibblin' gnats, knuckles and nicotine
Ten tenacious turnabouts
Tenaciously tracking through
Thickly Thackeray Timber Town!

Ho-ho! We back at you again
WGAP, and y'all thought we was gone
Now dig!
Tweedly dee, tweedly dum
It's all about that bumpin' in your gums!
F-U-N for fun

Sucker and things, double jaw jackin'
Say it again, fun!

Bumpin' of the gums

To buy you no new dresses and things
