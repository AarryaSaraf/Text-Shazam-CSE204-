Oh, girl
Sometimes you start off as friends
And end up lovers, yeah
You said you needed more time
But just think about what we have
It's love enough to last forever

Let's talk about love
Stop wasting my time
Just open up your heart
Let's talk about love
Let's talk about love
Stop using your mind
Just look inside your heart
And baby you'll find

Oh, girl
Why should we lie about things
That feel so good inside?
Oh, baby

Just let your heart run free
Don't think about yesterday
Don't let tomorrow slip away

Let's talk about love
Stop using your mind
Just open up your heart
Let's talk about love
Let's talk about love
Stop wasting my time
Just look inside your heart
And soon you'll be mine
Let's talk about love
Stop using your mind
Just open up your heart
Stop wasting my time
Let's talk about love
Let's talk about love
Just look inside your heart
And say you'll be mine

Just let your heart run free
Don't think about yesterday
Don't let tomorrow slip away

We been looking at love so long
Both afraid of being the fool
But I don't care
I'll take the chance loving you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh ooh

Let's talk about love (let's talk about love, baby)
Just open up your heart (and just let me in)
Let's talk about love (let's talk about love, yeah)
Just look inside your heart (and say you'll be mine)
Let's talk about love (let's talk about love)
Just open up your heart (let's talk about love)
Let's talk about love (let's talk about love)
Just look inside your heart
Let's talk about love
