I know we'll make it

I know we'll make it
I got you where I want you
This time won't fake it
My love is gettin' stronger

I know we'll make it
I got you where I want you
This time won't fake it
My love is gettin' stronger

You know you're special to me
I'm the kind of guy
Who'll set your heart and soul free
I got, oh, I got what it takes
That makes you wanna shout
Makes you wanna say

I know we'll make it
I got you where I want you
This time won't fake it
My love is gettin' stronger

Your touch, your touch is too much
I can't take it, no, I'll make it
Your style, your style and your smile
Makes me wanna sing, wanna sing about it

Gonna get you, wanna get you
Gonna make you mine
Gonna get you, wanna get you
Gonna make you mine, make you mine
Gonna get you, wanna get you
Gonna make you mine
Gonna get you, wanna get you
Gonna make you mine, make you mine

I know we'll make it

I know we'll make it
I got you where I want you
This time won't fake it
My love is gettin' stronger
