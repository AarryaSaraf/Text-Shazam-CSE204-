You
You are something special to me
If only my eyes could see
You're my only

You
You are very special to me
If only my eyes could see
You're my only, you

Every time I see your face
I think about the day
That you told me that you love me, girl
You made it clear to stay

You
You are something special to me
If only my eyes could see
You're the greatest

You
You are something special to me
If only my eyes could see
You're the greatest

You
You are something special to me
If only my eyes could see
That you're my only

You
You are something special to me
If only my eyes could see
You're my, oh, only

When I see a flower grow
It reminds me of how I love you so
I'd like your friends and the world to know
That you're my love

Hope that you will understand
That when I reach and touch your hand
I only want to be your man
Please don't say no

You, you, you
You are something special to me
If only my eyes could see
(If my eyes could only see)
You're my only

You, you, you
You are something special to me
If only my eyes could see
(If my eyes could only, only see)
That you're my only

You, you, you, you, you
You are something special to me
If only my eyes could see
You're the greatest
(You're my only)

You, you, you
You are something special to me
If only my eyes could see
You're my only

You, you, you, you, you
You are something special to me
If only my eyes could see
You're my only

You, you, you
You are something special to me
If only my eyes could see
You're the greatest

You, you, you
You are something special to me
If only my eyes could see
That you're my only one

You are something special
You're my only love
