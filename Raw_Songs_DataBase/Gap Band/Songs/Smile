Smile, you owe it to yourself
And when there's nothing left
But troubles and heartache
You just smile
No matter what the price
You brighten up your life
Don't you worry 'bout it

Smile when loved ones turn away
There'll be a brighter day
If you just smile
Baby, when you are smiling
Baby, if you just smile

Smile when problems get you down
It hurts so much to frown
Hold your head up high
And you will smile
When loved ones turn away
Just walk away instead
And you will smile
Baby, smile

You just smile
When loved ones turn a head
You just walk away instead
And you will smile
