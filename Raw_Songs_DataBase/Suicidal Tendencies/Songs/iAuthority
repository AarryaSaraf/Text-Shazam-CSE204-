Paging Mr Psycho Michael
Please report to the microphone, immediately

We make it hit, we make you hot
Without the crazy beats that you just can't stop
Just deliver, straight over the top
The attitude is right, full rock
Fuck the name, free, pursuing legacy
Soon the fbi will say its service was after me
Said I shall make it and I'll shoot them again
That's where the love affair all began
They try to shake us down, take us down, break us down
But it takes a whole lot more than a bad rain cloud to
Bring a final fuckin' suicide man
'Cause you can't bring me down
You can't bring us down
Iauthority
You can't bring us down

And it's so beautiful, that's our forte
And it's too beautiful to me
And it's so beautiful, that's our forte
And it's so beautiful to me

(Okay, I think we've heard enough)
(It's time to step away from that mic)

A faster pace, in your face
Anytime or any place
For the power, for the scene or outer space
We'll dish it our like a verse you taste
I remember my first taste of police love
Got my ass beat with a Philly glove
In the alley with my hands right behind my back
That's a test of the devil of a mini attack
For four more days the police riots
The winner out there is their doughnut diets
The sign of the cross says to serve and protect
But we all know that's a bunch of shit
They give a kid a beatdown I'll never forget
So now I'm making sure that they'll never forget

And it's so beautiful, that's our forte
And it's too beautiful to me
And it's so beautiful, that's our forte
And it's so beautiful to me

(Drop the mic and come out slowly with your hands up)
(That was your last warning)

I done a full turn, I took the penalty
Show me no respect, no respect you see
You say fuck me? Fuck you!
Fuck my familia? then fuck yours too
Everyday I face another tear
But that won't change my definition of success
As long as this establishment tries to hold you back
It's your civic duty to be a maniac
A sense yellow pride if it can't fail
And I'll keep pushing until the end
I'll never be a law that can set you free
That's why I keep screaming: one more time

And it's so beautiful, that's our forte
And it's too beautiful to me
And it's so beautiful, that's our forte
And it's so beautiful to me

One more time, one more time
