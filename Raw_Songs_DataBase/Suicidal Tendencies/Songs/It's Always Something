It's always something
It's always something
It's always something
It's always something

It's always something
It's always something
It's always something
It's always something

It's always something that does me wrong
I try to ditch it, it tags along
It's always something of that I'm sure
But I don't know why or what they were

Facing choices I can't make
Living up to another mistake
Problems building up in my face
The answers leave without a trace
It's always, always, always, always, always, always, always something

It's always something
It's always something

It's always something that's what I've found
When I start sailing it brings me down
It's always something happens to me
Can't find the honey but I've stung by the bee

Facing choices I can't make
Living up to another mistake
Playing games I don't wanna play
It's not worth it anyway
It's always, always, always, always, always, always, always something

It's always something

It's always something
It's always something
It's always something
It's always something

It's always something
It's always something
It's always something
It's always something

It's always something that comes my way
I try to ditch it, it wants to play
It's always something at least I know
I feel it coming I gotta go

Facing choices I can't make
Living up to another mistake
Problems building up in my face
The answers leave without a trace
Facing choices I can't make
Living up to another mistake
Playing games I don't wanna play
It's not worth winning anyway
It's always, always, always, always, always, always, always something

It's always something
It's always something

It's always something
It's always something
It's always something
It's always something
