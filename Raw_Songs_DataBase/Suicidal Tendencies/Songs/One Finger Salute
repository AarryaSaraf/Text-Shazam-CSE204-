The power of the sweat
The pain we won't forget
The worst is coming yet
But you know we'll be waiting for it!

Stick your finger in the air, wave it like you just don't care
Battle on another day, give'm hell another way
Hurry up don't you wait, prepare to take on all their hate
Rise on up you got to climb, seize the moment, cause its our time

Stand tall... and hold your head high
Raise your fist middle finger up to the sky
Our conviction you can not dispute
Stand at attention... here's your one finger salute!

Stick your finger in the air, this is how we show we care
Lies and pain and misery, stop the self inflicted agony
Corruption and abuse of power, it's the tyranny of the hour
No better time, no other place, it's our fight, the human race

Stand tall... and hold your head high
Raise your fist with your middle finger to the sky
We won't back down you can not dispute
We stand in contempt... one finger salute

Stick your finger in the air, wave it like you just don't care
Stick your finger in the air, stick your finger in the air

One finger salute... One finger salute
One finger salute... One finger salute

The power of the sweat
The pain we can't forget
The worst is coming yet
But we'll be ready for it... Get ready!

You think you're thinking but your out of  your mind
You got no vision cause your morally blind
Can't fill our hearts when your's is hollow
You can not lead cause we won't follow

One finger salute... The power of the sweat
One finger salute... The pain we won't forget
One finger salute... The worst is coming yet
So you better be ready for it!
