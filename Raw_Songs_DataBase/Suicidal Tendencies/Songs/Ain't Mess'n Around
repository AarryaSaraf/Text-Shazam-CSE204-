I'm sick and tired of the status quo
And here's something else that you should know
You got it, I want it, I ain't mess'n around
I don't care about authority
'Cause they don't give a damn about me
I want it, you got it, I ain't mess'n around

'Cause I'm as free as free can be
'Cause I believe and nothing can take that from me
'Cause I'm as strong as strong can be
And I will fight, I fight for what I believe

We all have our own right to live
You mess with me then something's gonna give
You got it, I want it, I ain't mess'n around
You call it wrong, but I call it right
You try to stop me then you've got a fight
You got it, I want it, I ain't mess'n around

Come and join us and you'll see
That we are proud, 'cause we got the right to believe
Try to stop us and you'll see
That we are strong, and we fight for what we believe

The system doesn't care 'bout you or me
It only cares about prosperity
You got it, I want it, I ain't mess'n around
They lock the gates and they guard the doors
But we're good at sneaking through the cracks and pores
You got it, I want it, I ain't mess'n around

I lost my hope and sensitivity
If that makes me crazy well I guess that's me
You got it, I want it, I ain't mess'n around
You can question my sanity
But you can't question my integrity
You got it, I want it, we ain't mess'n around, no

Come and join us and you'll see
Our future's now, and we back up what we believe
Try and shut us out you'll see
That we don't care, 'cause we know what not to believe

We're sick and tired of the status quo
And here's one more thing that you should know
You got it, we want it, we ain't mess'n around
Don't give a fuck about authority
Cause authority don't give a fuck about me
You got it, we want it, we ain't mess'n around

Ain't mess'n around
Ain't mess'n around
You got it, we want it, we ain't mess'n around
Ain't mess'n around (don't give a fuck about authority)
Ain't mess'n around (cause authority don't give a fuck about me)
You got it, we want it, we ain't mess'n around
