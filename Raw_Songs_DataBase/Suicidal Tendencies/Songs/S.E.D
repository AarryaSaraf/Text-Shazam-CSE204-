My house was kinda lonely
On the cutting of the emerging soil
Crazy hits, shot bitch
Hypnotised by violent fish
Feels like rats chewing under my skin (my skin yeah)
Emotions terrorize growth within
Systematic Emotional Destruction (dysfunction)
DFDS inside
It's almost like you have got nothing (nothing, got nothing)
The pressure on my chest, my tongue, makes me want to breathe
I can't breathe
While the empowered neighbor's putting pressure on me
Fuck me

Feels like rats chewing under my skin (rats under my skin)
Emotions terrorize growth within
Systematic Emotional Destruction (dysfunction)
Yeah to envision my self-hatred, right now
It's a working bombshell (hate, hate, hate myself)
No purpose, no day, no hump, no great protection
(No hope, no nothing)
Like predicted, my soul nicely mangled in suspension
(Dig, dig out of suspension)

After standing, naked and alone
I'm made to wonder just for how many other
Sins must I atone?
And as my mind's a fog and my shredded light is gone
I'm cursed with the knowledge that whatever good deeds
I do is never enough
And as you've said, it seems like things lead to multi
Multi years more
I think I won't quite receive the support I'm looking for
But I'm way too proud to have this taint me as damaged goods
As I'm quick to dare some post redemption and miracles
Sometimes meek and timid cast myself to possibly be
Another mercy, talk of mercy
It's a passing prize, I needed, you can't even care less
Everytime I tried to slay, demons were deep, deep
Deep within
You've been caught by the spirit
To better prevent the course of sin
You better have it in your conscience just as father, mother, mother
A simple deed for you, it's all I want to talk to now

No you, can't take me
No you, won't save me
No you, can't save me
Just change your state of mind
Systematic Emotional Destruction

Feels like rats chewing under my skin (my skin yeah)
Emotions terrorize growth within
Systematic Emotional Distruction
Systematic Emotional Distruction
