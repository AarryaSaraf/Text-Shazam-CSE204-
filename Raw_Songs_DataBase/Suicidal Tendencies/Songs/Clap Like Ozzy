Clap like OZZY 
Slam like a beast!
Clap like OZZY 

Battle off the masses confusion,
Strength and belief are not an illusion
Embrace their laughter, to power on
Forget their faces, they'll soon gone
Wreck the walls that hold you back,
Born again maniac!
It's your journey, you'll laugh and cry
But live to live, don't live to die

Death is coming, there's no place to hide
But while we're living, give it a hell of a ride
Time wait's for no one, on that you can trust
So live life with purpose, and you'll ride that rush

Clap like OZZY 
Slam like a beast!
Clap like OZZY 

Sucking on the kiss of death, funny how they think they're blessed
No horoscope or destiny, can justify this agony
Silhouettes of lost potential, when everyday is not essential
Procrastinate the long good bye,
Live to live, not live to die

Death is knocking, don't answer the door
There's never a good time, we need so much more
Can't pick the moment, no time will ever be right
But while we're breathing, we'll give it a hell of a fight

Now take a second... catch your breath
Now think about what you wanna do
Don't let anyone stop you
Now take a second
Catch your breath... Do that thing you do!

Do that thing you do! Do that thing you do!
Do that thing you do! Do that thing you do!
Do that thing you do!
