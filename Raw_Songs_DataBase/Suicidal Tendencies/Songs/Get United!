Bumped you and what do you get
A wound to your head less you soon forget
It's fast forward, it was mediated
But the vision that never showed up and created
The bye-product of when you divide
And give peace no place to hide
Another soul they say rest in peace
And now and then seeks onto a leash
The place has changed but not the pain
Over and over it gets me wiped again
It will never change until it's decided
Who's to gain by us being divided?
Fuck that, and you soon will see
Who in fact is a real enemy
The real challenge, will you face it or fight it?
It will only happen if you get united

Get united, get united
Get united, get united
Get united
Get united
Get united
Get united
Get united
Get united

Straight for power
United
Straight for peace

Take a second, it's all so clear
The scenario, that's their worst fear
We're all low class scum in their eyes
So let's all give them a hell of a surprise
Suppose I had to take a tour in due course
And let's take it straight to the mother fuckin' source
To all of those that wanna keep us down
It's time that a new sherriff rolled his ass into town
We don't need no stinking badge on our chest
And let's get united and fuck the rest
Getting crazy and breaking laws
Put in work, for the cause
Just getting dope has got to me
We say a freedom fighter you say it's a felony
Put your recorder let's ride out the ride
If we're gonna take a side, let's do it side by side

Get united, get united
Get united, get united
Get united

Brothers united and gangs united and folks united
Get united

Gangsters united and skaters united and suits united

Get united, get united
Get united, get united
