The worst pain is when a tear leaves my eye
I try to fight it cause a grown man shouldn't cry
But when they start it seems I can't make it end
And when I do they just start up again
I try to fight it, I get in the stance
It takes my strength, leaves me deep in a trance
It suffocates me till I wither and wilt
It's the strongest feeling I've ever felt
Feel like a block that's being whittled away
But I'm still holding out for a peaceful day
Sometimes crushing, sometimes subtly
It weighs me down and leaves me empty

Save a peace for me
Save a peace for me
Save a peace for me

Save a peace for me
Save a peace for me
Save a peace for me

Fall to my knees past time to pray
My lips are sealed shut got noting to say
I spend my time trying to forget
All of the times that I felt like shit
Too many things that I did for fun
Now I know I never should have done
I look around, there's nothing to see
I look inside, I'm all empty

Running on empty,
So damn empty,
Hungry and empty,
Please save a peace for me

So many times I've wondered why
So many times I didn't care if I'd die
I learned the things that a sane man don't know
I've lived in places where the law's scared to go
I've seen lives prematurely be spent
I've bent my finger with full intent
I've had more than one intended for me
But I guess it wasn't meant to be

Running on empty,
So damn empty,
Hungry and empty,
Please save a peace for me

Save a peace for me
Save a peace for me

I look around, there's nothing to see
I look inside, I don't like me
I spend my time trying to forget
All of the times that I felt like shit
I may be proud but I need a lift
I'm holding out for a fulfilling gift
When I'm warmed by an inner smile
And that my soul is shining all the while

Save a peace for me,
Save a peace for me,
Save a peace for me,

Save a peace for me
Save a peace for me
Save a peace for me
Save me a peace

Running on empty,
So damn empty,
Hungry and empty,
Please save a peace for me
Please save a peace for me
Please save a peace for me
