Violence isn't the only option
Come on, fist teach your face

Destruction
I love destruction
Destruction

I like to pick a special something
I flick a switch and I blow it to nothing
I got a feeling that I can't resist
Feels so good to clench my fist
Doesn't really matter if I'm wrong or right
Just gives me an excuse for a fight
A violent rage comes over me
Now I'm headed to ecstasy cause

I love, I love destruction (destruction, destroy)
And all I need, all I need is destruction (destruction, I wanna destroy)

Destruction
I love destruction
Destruction

Looky there ain't that something
Looky now I blew it to nothing
Pretty people living pretty lives
Don't expect me to apologize cause

I love, I love destruction (destruction, destroy)
And all I need, all I need is destruction (destruction, destroy)
And when I bleed, I bleed destruction (destruction, destroy)
Cause I love, I love destruction (destruction, I wanna destroy)

Destruction
I love destruction
Destruction
Add a little self destruction

Worked its way from the back of my mind
Imagination that is so unkind
It doesn't take much to make the assumption
That I love, I love destruction

I love, I love destruction (destruction, destroy)
And all I need, all I need is destruction (destruction, destroy)
And when I bleed, I bleed destruction (destruction, destroy)
Cause I love, I love destruction (destruction, I wanna destroy)

Destruction
I love destruction
Destruction
I love destruction

Destruction
I love destruction
Destruction
I love destruction
