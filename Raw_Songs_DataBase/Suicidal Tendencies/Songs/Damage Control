You cloud my reflections
You taint my point of view
You smother my emotions and you poison my dreams too
And when it's time to leave me
I'm sure that you'll be proud
Cause you left me with no strength and a whole lot of doubts
Damage control, I need damage control, where's my damage control?
Damn it control! I need damage control, where's my damage control?

"Yea charlie, you might wanna get down here...
we got a mess going on here... I can't really figure it out,
just when you get down here I'll try and explain it, but, ah, oh shit!"

Sucker, sucker, sucker, sucker, sucker, sucker

Can't eat, think or drink
I so tried, can't even speak
I got no choice, cause I'm too weak
My minds' gone, it's on the bleak
It's time to conjure up all my strength from my head down to my toes
Cause I'm in for the fight of my life it's past time for damage control,
damage control!

Sucker, sucker, sucker, sucker, sucker, sucker

No luck, it's too bad
No hope, it's beyond sad
There's no peace, left in my brain
My heart's swelled, and filled with pain
So how I got myself into this place as my pain eats away at my soul
I hope you're in a forgiving mood cause I need you damage control, damn it control!
Damage control, damage control, damage control
Damage control, I need damage control, where's my damage control

Damn it control, damage control, I need damage control!

Sucker, sucker, sucker, sucker, sucker, sucker

A new game, another dance
The odds still suck, my last chance
Why do I try? It does no good
I shouldn't care, but then who would?
The last the thing, I confess to myself before I let my hatred blow
"I could have avoided all this pain, if I followed damage control!"
Damage control, damage control, damage control
where's my damage control?
