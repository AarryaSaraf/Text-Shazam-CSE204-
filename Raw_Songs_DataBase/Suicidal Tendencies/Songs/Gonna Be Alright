When life seems so weary
And the future looks dreary
If you listen you'll hear me
Say it's gonna be alright

It's gonna be, it's gonna be alright

Drenched in hypocrisy all hardened by the lunacy
But it's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
The truth is not pretty and the lies they come so easily
It's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
Always a part of me that screams to just let it be
It's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
When things don't go your way these three things you gotta say
It's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
Gonna be alright, gonna be alright

It's gonna be, it's gonna be alright


Grasp on to sacrifice if you fear it than you better think twice
It's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
Shame on the weaker ones when all is said and all is done
It's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
Stand up to the enemy I heard a voice it said to me
It's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
I know it's been said before but when you don't think you can take no more
It's gonna be alright, gonna alright
Gonna be alright, gonna be alright

It's gonna be, it's gonna be alright


Forsake the condition
A mental partition
Stay strong to the vision
It's gonna be

It's gonna be, it's gonna be alright

When your patience is spent just sit back and be content
It's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
Cause when the rain goes away it's gonna be a sunny day
It's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
Ain't got no quitter here, I'll shout it out loud and clear
It's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
When things don't go your way these three things I gotta say
It's gonna be alright, gonna alright
Gonna be alright, gonna be alright

It's gonna be, it's gonna be alright


It's gonna be, gonna be alright
It's gonna be, gonna be alright
It's gonna be, gonna be alright
It's gonna be, gonna be alright
Gonna be alright, gonna be alright

It's gonna be, it's gonna be alright


When life seems so weary
And the future looks dreary
If you listen you'll hear me
Say it's gonna be alright
