Just look around you'll see the whole world gone crazy
I used to blame it on the hippies and the stoners and the lazy
Cause you need a clear mind when you take it to the street
When you lift up the pipe you've already admitted defeat
We need not just the fists to lift up but the souls to rise
To fight on against the tyrants and systems we despise
And if you're waiting on a hero then we'll all be damned
While the politicians laugh on cause it's going just as they planned

We're here tonight... so get your fight on!
It's on tonight... so get your right on!
We're here tonight...
It's on tonight... We're here tonight...
It's on tonight
We're here tonight...
Tonight's the night

Just look around you'll see the whole world gone crazy
I used to blame it on the hippies and stoners and the lazy
Cause you need a clear mind when you take it to the street
When you lift up the pipe you've already admitted defeat
We need not just the fists to lift up but the souls to rise
To fight on against the tyrants and systems we despise
And if you're waiting on a hero then we'll all be damned
While the politicians laugh on cause it's going just as they planned

We're here tonight... so get your fight on!
It's on tonight... so get your right on!
We're here tonight... so get your right on!
Tonight's the night... let's get our fight on!

My head is pounding from the terror
That's keeps blasting out of the tv
Don't take a genius or a chemist to figure out it's pure insanity
I know it's instinct that try's
Tells you that you bet to hide and retreat
But we've already lost if you're afraid to be beat

So get your fight on!
And get your right on!
Now get your right on!
And get your fight on!

You got to believe in a purpose, you got to fight for the just cause
You got to know the difference of what's right and what's just a law
And you got to refuse that urge to ever, ever, ever give up
So are you ready to take on the fight
Cause we know the world's so fucked up
Let's get our fight on!

As long as we move as long as we breath now get your right on!
As long as we live, we'll always believe now got your right on!
As long as we breath, we'll always believe now got your fight on!

We're here tonight... so get your fight on!
It's on tonight... so get your right on!
We're here tonight... so get your right on!
Tonight's the night...
It's on tonight... so get your right on
Get your fight on
Get your right on
Get your fight on
Get your right on
Get your fight on

My head is pounding from the terror
That keeps blasting out of the tv
Don't take a genius or a chemist to figure out its pure insanity
I know it's instinct that tries
Tells you that you bet to hide and retreat
But we've already lost if you're afraid to be beat

Get your fight on
Get your right on!
So get your right on!
And get your fight on!
We're here tonight... so get your fight on!
It's on tonight... so get your right on!
We're here tonight... so get your fight on!
Tonight's the night...
It's on tonight... get your right on

You got to believe in a purpose, you got to fight for the just cause
You got to know the difference of what's right and what's just a law
And you got to refuse that urge don't, ever, never give up
So are you ready to take on the fight
Cause we know the world's so fucked up

Get your fight on!
We're here tonight... so get your fight on!
It's on tonight... so get your right on!
We're here tonight... so get your right on!

As long as we move as long as we breath so get your right on!
As long as we live, we'll always believe so get your right on!
As long as we breath, we'll always believe so get your fight on!
