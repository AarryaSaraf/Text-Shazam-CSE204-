She has dead flowers in her hair
But the pain blooms in her mind
And if anyone had carred
It would scare them what they'd find
As her eyes said, Can you help, can you help me?
And her pain pleads
Please please help me
And her silent screams are begging you to help me please
Now her soul whispers: Why?

So many reasons to die for... I just need one to live
Another reason to die for

It's so sad, sad, sad, no one can see it
She's so sad, sad, sad, and nobody is there
She's so sad, sad, sad she feels all alone
It's so sad, sad, sad we're always too late to care

All these reasons to die for... How bout just one to live
Another reason to die for... Just give me one to live
I'm still haunted by the scene
Never was there a pain as real
And as hard as you can try and try to deny and deny
It's so sad, sad, sad, no one can see it
Cause her eyes said: Can you help, can you help?
She's so sad, sad, sad, and nobody is there
As her pain pleads
Please please help me,  please please help me
She's so sad, sad, sad she feels all alone
And her silence screams are begging you to help me please
It's so sad, sad, sad we're always too late to care
And now  her soul whispers: Goodbye
Another reason to die for
Give me one to live
All these reasons to die for
Aren't we dying to live?
All these reasons to die for
How bout one to live?
So many reasons to die for... When we're dying to live

Rise, rise, rise... I want you to rise, rise up and shine
I want you to rise, rise up and shine
I want you to rise, rise up and shine
I want you to rise, rise up and shine
