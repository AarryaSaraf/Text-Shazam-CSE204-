Album: WorldGoneMad

// This World //

I serve my heart up on a platter
The world laughs at me like I don't even matter
You grab my hand just to squeeze too tight
You cause me pain just so I'll feel your might
You cast your vengeance so easily
Again found guilty in absentee
So why's it when everybody looks at me
The always judge me for the things they can't see?

I take your suffering and I eat it like dessert
I'm not a masochist I just can't stand to see you hurt
But every time I think of you my heart and mind disagree
You know I'd love you, why won't you love me?
The voices in my head keep me up all night

Fighting over and over about what's wrong and what's right
So many people have done me wrong, I had to stop the list
'Cause it got too long
You do me wrong yet I still care
there's not a thing that I won't share
I can't win the fight to prove my love
'Cause you're a hawk and I'm a dove

I'd like to show the world my love
I'd like to show the world my love
I'd like to show the world my love
But this world don't deserve my love
I'd like to show the world my love
I'd like to show the world my love
I'd like to show the world my love
But this world don't deserve my love

This world don't deserve my love, this world don't deserve
My love
This world don't deserve my love, this world don't deserve
My love
So I'll save it all for God up above, so I save all for God
Up above

// Clap Like Ozzy //

Clap like OZZY [x3]
Slam like a beast!
Clap like OZZY [x3]

Battle off the masses confusion,
Strength and belief are not an illusion
Embrace their laughter, to power on
Forget their faces, they'll soon gone
Wreck the walls that hold you back,
Born again maniac!
It's your journey, you'll laugh and cry
But live to live, don't live to die

Death is coming, there's no place to hide
But while we're living, give it a hell of a ride
Time wait's for no one, on that you can trust
So live life with purpose, and you'll ride that rush

Clap like OZZY [x3]
Slam like a beast!
Clap like OZZY [x3]

Sucking on the kiss of death, funny how they think they're blessed
No horoscope or destiny, can justify this agony
Silhouettes of lost potential, when everyday is not essential
Procrastinate the long good bye,
Live to live, not live to die

Death is knocking, don't answer the door
There's never a good time, we need so much more
Can't pick the moment, no time will ever be right
But while we're breathing, we'll give it a hell of a fight

Now take a second... catch your breath
Now think about what you wanna do
Don't let anyone stop you
Now take a second
Catch your breath... Do that thing you do!

Do that thing you do! Do that thing you do!
Do that thing you do! Do that thing you do!
Do that thing you do!

Clap like OZZY [x3]
Slam like a beast!
Clap like OZZY [x3]
Slam like a beast!
Clap like OZZY [x3]
Slam like a beast!

// Living For Life //

I'm here to tell you once again
This is the beginning of the end
Sacrificial emotions that torture the mind
Spiritual delusions that lead the blind
Questioning the motives of those that forsake
Adding kerosene to the souls that ache 
I'm just a messenger my friend
I can not stop what you can't end
Living for life!

And now I'm back here once more facing up with what I despise
Face to face
But when you stand up strong and don't give in oh what a rise!
You can't get back what you waste away while you think that life ain't
fair... Life ain't fair!
Cause the seconds, minutes, hours, days, years they don't really care
They don't care!

Oh! The tears and all the sweat
Oh! That pain you'll never forget
Oh! The doubt that rips you apart
But oh! The sweetness of each pulse of the heart

It's a fight till the end
We'll keep that fight till the end
They'll be a fight till the end
It's our fight to the end... Living for life!

I get so pissed, and sick, and tired, of all the lies
Sick of the lies!
But when you face the truth and battle on... oh what a rise!
So when you're down so low and can't find the strength to get back up
Get up!
We'll be there in spirit screaming "yo get your fuck'n ass up!"
Get your ass up!

Oh! The screams and all the cries
Oh! The shame and all of the lies
Oh! The little things that tear us apart
But oh! The sweetness of each pulse of the heart

But now we're living to live... Live your life!
Oh how we're living to live... Living for life!
How we're living to live... Live your life!
Now we're living to live... Living for life!
When life gets hard, then hard is what you need to be
Cause there's nothing wrong with going toe to toe with reality

There's nothing more painful than the ending of the end
They'll be no more warnings ever again 
No more avoidance or looking back
Just the tortured remains of a brutal attack

Sadness was all you were trained to find
Brutally tortured by your own mind
You killed the messengers my friend
But that never kills the pain within

// World Gone Mad! //

The whole world's going insane
The whole world's going insane
The whole world's going insane
Has the whole world gone insane?

I'm angry... and I don't know why
I'm pissed off... and screaming at the sky
Found guilty of... being so confused
Plead guilty... of being so confused
I'm watching... but I don't believe
I'm waiting... for some kinda of of relief
This ignorance... so easily copped.
This sickness... it's gotta be stopped

World gone mad!World gone mad! World gone mad!

The whole world's going insane
The whole world's going insane
The whole world's going insane
Has the whole world gone insane?

Why you laughing? - this is not a joke!
They're trying to blind us – with all the smoke
Leading the people – into the mouth of jaws
It's an illusion, like the Wizard of Oz
Defiance- in the last degree
Breeds reliance- on their insanity
I'm tripped out... you can believe such crap
Why can't you see you're caught in they're trap!

World gone mad!World gone mad! World gone mad!

They're selling us insanity
We're paying with our apathy
This kind of mental bankruptcy
This sickness is their fantasy
But I'm fighting for my sanity
This won't be my reality
I wont be part of this tragedy
Their perversion is not technology

World gone mad!World gone mad! World gone mad!

Plastic surgery, a la carte
Can't photo shop, your broken heart
Can't undo, the lies you post
Can't unfriend, the emotions that hurt the most
We've all lost it, it's so evident
For likes on waste book it's all relevant
How pathetic... fake reality
Just makes me wanna smash it, that damn tv

World gone mad!World gone mad! World gone mad!
They're selling us insanity
World gone mad!World gone mad! World gone mad!
We're paying with our apathy

World gone mad!
The whole world's going insane
Has the whole world gone insane?

// Happy Never After //

Sick to the bone, diagnosis unknown
Sick to the bone, confused and alone

Happy never after, Happy never after, Happy never after,

Feeling nothing... Wanting something
To take away all my pain

Seeing nothing... Hearing something
Please make it all go away

Where's my happy ever after? There's no happy ever after 
Where's my happy ever after? Just a happy never after 

Sensing something... Smelling nothing
But the stench suffocates

Madness – loaded... Mind is bloated
Can't keep going this way

Won't be happy ever after... There ain't no happy ever after
Never a happy ever after... Always a happy never after

Rotting slowly, feeling unholy
Denial seething, rotting, bleeding
Happy never after, happy never after
So stop dreaming

Happy never after, Happy never after, Happy never after
Wake up to another nightmare

Won't be a happy ever after... There ain't no happy ever after
Never a happy ever after... Always a happy never after

Nothing to hide, but all the pain inside
Sick to the bone, confused and alone
Nowhere to hide all the pain that's inside

Nothing left, nothing right
Nothing right, nothing left inside!

Feeling nothing... Wanting something
To take away all this pain

Seeing nothing... Hearing something
Make it go away

Won't be a happy ever after... There ain't no happy ever after
Never a happy ever after... Always a happy never after

Nothing to hide but all the pain that's inside
Sadness turning, emotions burning
Sick to the bone, confused and alone
Creeping faster the final disaster
Rotting out slowly, feeling unholy
Denial and seething, rotting and bleeding

There ain't no happy ever after
Happy never after, Happy never after, Happy never after
Happy never after, Happy never after, Happy never after

Nothing left, nothing right... Where's my happy ever after?
Nothing right, nothing left... Never a  happy ever after
Nothing left, nothing right... Always a happy never after
Nothing right, nothing left inside

// One Finger Salute //

The power of the sweat
The pain we won't forget
The worst is coming yet
But you know we'll be waiting for it!

Stick your finger in the air, wave it like you just don't care
Battle on another day, give'm hell another way
Hurry up don't you wait, prepare to take on all their hate
Rise on up you got to climb, seize the moment, cause its our time

Stand tall... and hold your head high
Raise your fist middle finger up to the sky
Our conviction you can not dispute
Stand at attention... here's your one finger salute!

Stick your finger in the air, this is how we show we care
Lies and pain and misery, stop the self inflicted agony
Corruption and abuse of power, it's the tyranny of the hour
No better time, no other place, it's our fight, the human race

Stand tall... and hold your head high
Raise your fist with your middle finger to the sky
We won't back down you can not dispute
We stand in contempt... one finger salute

Stick your finger in the air, wave it like you just don't care
Stick your finger in the air, stick your finger in the air

One finger salute... One finger salute
One finger salute... One finger salute

The power of the sweat
The pain we can't forget
The worst is coming yet
But we'll be ready for it... Get ready!

You think you're thinking but your out of  your mind
You got no vision cause your morally blind
Can't fill our hearts when your's is hollow
You can not lead cause we won't follow

One finger salute... The power of the sweat
One finger salute... The pain we won't forget
One finger salute... The worst is coming yet
So you better be ready for it!

// Damage Control //

You cloud my reflections
You taint my point of view
You smother my emotions and you poison my dreams too
And when it's time to leave me
I'm sure that you'll be proud
Cause you left me with no strength and a whole lot of doubts
Damage control, I need damage control, where's my damage control?
Damn it control! I need damage control, where's my damage control?

"Yea charlie, you might wanna get down here...
we got a mess going on here... I can't really figure it out,
just when you get down here I'll try and explain it, but, ah, oh shit!"

Sucker, sucker, sucker, sucker, sucker, sucker

Can't eat, think or drink
I so tried, can't even speak
I got no choice, cause I'm too weak
My minds' gone, it's on the bleak
It's time to conjure up all my strength from my head down to my toes
Cause I'm in for the fight of my life it's past time for damage control,
damage control!

Sucker, sucker, sucker, sucker, sucker, sucker

No luck, it's too bad
No hope, it's beyond sad
There's no peace, left in my brain
My heart's swelled, and filled with pain
So how I got myself into this place as my pain eats away at my soul
I hope you're in a forgiving mood cause I need you damage control, damn it control!
Damage control, damage control, damage control
Damage control, I need damage control, where's my damage control

Damn it control, damage control, I need damage control!

Sucker, sucker, sucker, sucker, sucker, sucker

A new game, another dance
The odds still suck, my last chance
Why do I try? It does no good
I shouldn't care, but then who would?
The last the thing, I confess to myself before I let my hatred blow
"I could have avoided all this pain, if I followed damage control!"
Damage control, damage control, damage control
where's my damage control?

// The Struggle Is Real //

Shattered minds, shattered dreams
It's never ever what it seems
Staged random for more questions than clues
Carefully camouflaged just to confuse

How does it feel
Hey, no, oh no, why no? Cause the struggle's real!

Actions shout, lunatic!
Same results, still doesn't click
Heart is racing, brains like mush
Still searching for another rush

Hey, no, oh, why no... How does it feel?
And I say, Hey no, oh no, why no?
When the struggle's real!

And I say, Hey no, oh no, why no?
How does it feel?
And we say, Hey no, oh no, why no?
This struggle is real! The struggle is real!
Pedal to the metal, got no brakes
Close my eyes, raise the stakes
Seeing things I shouldn't see
Wishing this was an anomaly

Hey no, oh, why no
How does it feel?
And I say, Hey no, oh no, why no?
Cause the struggle is real!

Actions speak, war by words
Trampled by the sonic hurds
Questioning how I feel?
Don't waste your time, this struggle's real!

Hey, no, oh, why no... How does it feel?
And I say, Hey no, oh no, why no?
When the struggle's real!
And I say, Hey no, oh no, why no?
How does it feel?

And we say, Hey no, oh no, why no?
The struggle is real! This struggle is real!

// Still Dying To Live //

She has dead flowers in her hair
But the pain blooms in her mind
And if anyone had carred
It would scare them what they'd find
As her eyes said, Can you help, can you help me?
And her pain pleads
Please please help me
And her silent screams are begging you to help me please
Now her soul whispers: Why?

So many reasons to die for... I just need one to live
Another reason to die for

It's so sad, sad, sad, no one can see it
She's so sad, sad, sad, and nobody is there
She's so sad, sad, sad she feels all alone
It's so sad, sad, sad we're always too late to care

All these reasons to die for... How bout just one to live
Another reason to die for... Just give me one to live
I'm still haunted by the scene
Never was there a pain as real
And as hard as you can try and try to deny and deny
It's so sad, sad, sad, no one can see it
Cause her eyes said: Can you help, can you help?
She's so sad, sad, sad, and nobody is there
As her pain pleads
Please please help me,  please please help me
She's so sad, sad, sad she feels all alone
And her silence screams are begging you to help me please
It's so sad, sad, sad we're always too late to care
And now  her soul whispers: Goodbye
Another reason to die for
Give me one to live
All these reasons to die for
Aren't we dying to live?
All these reasons to die for
How bout one to live?
So many reasons to die for... When we're dying to live

Rise, rise, rise... I want you to rise, rise up and shine
I want you to rise, rise up and shine
I want you to rise, rise up and shine
I want you to rise, rise up and shine
