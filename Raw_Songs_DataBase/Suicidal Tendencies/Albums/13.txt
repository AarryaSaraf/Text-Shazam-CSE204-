My name is Cyco Miko, and I'm a maniac

You know you missed me and I guiess I missed you too
It's time for us to share that special magic that we do
I'm sick and tired of watching the whole world get it wrong
Sou you better hope that I can't change the world with a song...
'Cause I'd change it all!

Come on, shake it everybody, it's time to work the demons on out
Suicidal's back!
Come on, shake it everybody, it's time to work the demons on out

Can someone please ge me a diet pepsi?

You can't return to sender all this love I send
You have no choice in this, only I can say when it ends
You may not know it yet, but you're loving it that we're back
'Cause there ain't nothing as sweet as a suicidal maniac, viva los
Maniacs!

Come on, shake it everybody, it's time to work the demons on out
Suicidal's back!

Suicidal's back!
Come on, shake it everybody, it's time to work the demons on out

Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Come on, shake it everybody, it's time to work the demons on out
Suicidal's back!
Come on, shake it everybody, it's time to work the demons on out

// Smash It! //

Smash It!

I got bruises scars and broken bones
One of a kind I can't be cloned
Meditation would be a sin
I love my homie, adrenaline
I've had fears and doubts and lots of pain
Suffered lots of loss, for little gain
While your rules say I can never win
I still love my chances, adrenaline

I'm fired up today's the day! 
I can't be stopped, there ain't no way!
The bodys used to get it done
But the mind is where this battles won

Charge charge charge, bash bash bash... adrenaline
Fight fight fight, smash smash smash... adrenaline

Smash It!

Racing down a hill at 8 adrenaline
Slamming surfing motocross or skate adrenaline
Caco slamming in the pit adrenaline
Riot pigs marching in adrenaline

I can't be stopped, today's the day!
Refuse to fail, there's no way
My destiny's in front of me
This moments like an eternity

Bash bash bash, smash smash smash pure adrenaline
Smash smash smash, bash bash bash pure adrenaline

Adrenaline! Adrenaline! Smash it! Smash it!

Racing down a hill at 8 adrenaline
Slamming surfing motocross or skate adrenaline
Caco slamming in the pit adrenaline
Riot pigs marching in adrenaline

// This Ain't A Celebration //

This ain't a celebration, this ain't a celebration
Pissed off like a mutha it's just par for the course
This ain't a celebration
I've felt a lot of things but never felt remorse
This ain't a celebration
If you go digging inside my head watch out where you probe
This ain't a celebration
I got some messed up shit inside my frontal lobe
This ain't a celebration

They turn the furnace on inside me
The anger burns inside my head
But there's one thing that they didn't count on
Is that I'll fight, fight, fight until the end

This ain't a celebration, this ain't a celebration

The give and take was I give and you just take
This ain't a celebration
Trapped in a situation I'm desperate to escape
This ain't a celebration
Pulled on me way to hard you triggered the silent alarm
This ain't a celebration
I only get violent to minimize the harm
This ain't a celebration

I got pure hatred on the one side
I got an itching for revenge
I got the power all inside me
'Cause I will fight, fight, fight until the end

This ain't a celebration

This ain't a celebration, This ain't a celebration
Pissed off like a mutha it's just par for the course
This ain't a celebration
I've felt a lot of things but never felt remorse
This ain't a celebration
If you go digging inside my head watch out where you probe
This ain't a celebration
I got some messed up shit inside my frontal lobe
This ain't a celebration

They turn the furnace on inside me
The anger burns inside my head
But there's one thing that they didn't count on
Is that I'll fight, fight, fight until the end

This ain't a celebration, this ain't a celebration

The give and take was I give and you just take
This ain't a celebration
Trapped in a situation I'm desperate to escape
This ain't a celebration
Pulled on me way to hard you triggered the silent alarm
This ain't a celebration
I only get violent to minimize the harm
This ain't a celebration

I got pure hatred on the one side
I got an itching for revenge
I got the power all inside me
'Cause I will fight, fight, fight until the end

This ain't a celebration

This ain't a celebration, this ain't a celebration
Pissed off like a mutha it's just par for the course
This ain't a celebration
I've felt a lot of things but never felt remorse
This ain't a celebration
If you go digging inside my head watch out where you probe
This ain't a celebration
I got some messed up shit inside my frontal lobe
This ain't a celebration

They turn the furnace on inside me
The anger burns inside my head
But there's one thing that they didn't count on
Is that I'll fight, fight, fight until the end

This ain't a celebration, this ain't a celebration

The give and take was I give and you just take
This ain't a celebration
Trapped in a situation I'm desperate to escape
This ain't a celebration
Pulled on me way to hard you triggered the silent alarm
This ain't a celebration
I only get violent to minimize the harm
This ain't a celebration

I got pure hatred on the one side
I got an itching for revenge
I got the power all inside me
'Cause I will fight, fight, fight until the end

This ain't a celebration, this ain't a celebration
This ain't a celebration no this ain't a celebration
This ain't a celebration no this ain't a celebration
This ain't a celebration no this ain't a celebration
This ain't a celebration no this ain't a celebration

// God Only Knows Who I Am //

Everybody is born, but not everbody lives
And just because you may be breathing
That don't mean that you are living

I'm not that person, that you want me to be
I'm not that person, you better face the reality
I'm not that person, so don't tell me that you understand
'Cause I am the person, that nobody can

No, no, no you don't get it!
No, no, why can't you get it?
No, no, you never seem to get it
That's why I say just funk it and forget
No, no, no you don't get it
No, no, why can't you get it?
No, no, you never seem to get it
That's why I say just funk it man forget

I'm not that person, that would sit alone and cry
I'm not that person, that didn't care if I lived or died
I'm not that person, that you used to slap around
I am the person, that'll beat your ass down

No, no, no you don't get it!
No, no, why can't you get it?
No, no, you never seem to get it
That's why I say just funk it and forget
No, no, no you don't get it
No, no, why can't you get it?
No, no, you never seem to get it
That's why I say just funk it man forget

And God only knows, and God only knows
And God only knows, and God only knows

No, no, no you don't get it!
No, no, no you don't get it!
No, no, no you don't get it!
No, no, no you don't get it!

Dear God how come it takes a lifetime to live, but only a second to die?

And God only knows, who I am
And God only knows, who I am
And God only knows, who I am
And God only knows... no, no, no you don't get it!
No, no, you never seem to get it!
No, no, why can't you get it? 
No, no, no you don't get it!

// Make Your Stand //

I was railroaded, framed and unjustly found guilty
Then again I was the judge and the jury
I was bashed, beaten, bullied and left battered in the alley
You can chaulk it up to another self inflicted tally

Stand up with conviction, give your demons the eviction
Do not waver, show trepidation
Stand up with conviction

I looked straight into the eyes of evil and I was shaking with fear
Oh Lord how I hate it when I look into the mirror
I fell so far I'd have to climb a mountain just to touch the bottom
I try not to let you see them, but the demons yea I got'm

Stand up with conviction, give your demons an eviction
Do not waver, show trepidation
Make your stand with conviction
Stand up, stand up, stand up, with conviction
Stand up, stand up, stand up, with conviction
Make your stand with conviction

It was so weak and fraile the first time that I meet it
But then it grow so big and strong from all the pain that I feed it
It turned on me so quick that I didn't understand it
But then again it turned out just the way I planned it

'Cause I was down...
Yea I was down
Down down down down down down low
I was so low I had to climb a mountain jut to touch the bottom
Down down down down down low
Make your stand with conviction
You can not make a stand... if you're afraid to fall
Make your stand
Stand up, stand up, stand up with conviction
Make your stand, make your stand, make your stand with conviction
You gotta make your stand, you gotta make your stand, with conviction

// Who's Afraid? //

I wanna know something
Who's, who's, who's afraid to get cyco?

I make up my own rules, don't you remember me?
I still don't give a damn, why can't you look at me
I got a lot more to take, you think you know me?
A Cyco's got a right to know

Who's afraid of a cyco?
Get caco, a Cyco's got a right to know
Who's afraid of a Cyco?
Get cyco, us Cyco's wanna know

I get straight to the oint, you don't know me
I magnify what's inside, you think you know me
And plus I give you my soul, you can't ignore me
I don't conceal or don't disguise

Who's afraid of a Cacy? A Cyco's got a right to know
Who's afraid to go cyco? This Cyco wants to know
Yea, I wanna know
Who's afraid of a Cacy? A Cyco's got a right to know
Who's afraid to go cyco? This Cyco wants to know

Ain't no stopping a Cyco, ain't no stopping a Cyco
Ain't no stopping a Cyco, ain't no stopping a Cyco

I got a feeling coming over me, another battle with reality
Redefining what's called sanity, the Cyco's gonna do it all night
Can't stop that feeling that's inside, that very very special
Part of me
The opposite of a lobotomy, a Caco's gonna do it all night

Let the Cyco's get cyco, let the Cyco's go cyco, let the cyco's
Be cyco all night
Let the Cyco's get cyco, let the Cyco's go cyco, let the cyco's
Be cyco all night
Let the Cyco's get cyco, let the Cyco's go cyco, let the cyco's
Be cyco all night

Can't stop that feeling that's inside, that very very special
Part of me
The opposite of a lobotomy, a Cyco's gonna do it all night

Who's afraid of a Cyco? Who's afraid of a Cyco?
Who's afraid of a Cyco? Who's afraid of a Cyco?

Can't all just get along?

// Show Some Love... Tear It Down //

Show some love... show some love, tear it down!

I wouldn't sing it if it wasn't coming from my heart
It's time to bring the people back together that governments
Tear apart
And I refuse to be a victim, of corporate media tricks
And I'll never, never, never accept status quo politics

They try to tear us apart, they try to bring us down
They try to hold us back, tear it down
They try to tear us apart, they try to bring us down
They try to hold us back, tear it down
Show some love, tear it down, tear it down

Show some love, tear it down, tear it down

I got to teach about the real world, 'cause they're afraid to
Teach that in schools
And you'll never ever get nowhere blindly following other
Peoples rules
And if you think that I'm negative, then no one's ever shwon you
Real love
'Cause there comes a point in everyone's life, when they've had
Enough.

They try to hold us back, they try to bring us down
They try to tear us apart, tear it down
They try to tear us apart, they try to bring us down
They try to hold us back, tear it down
Show some love, tear it down, tear it down
Show some love, tear it down, tear it down

I'm calling out for a new kind of love
One that won't break down when things get tough
I know I may sound like I'm full of dreams
But I still believe we put our hearts and minds together we can
Do anything!

They try to hold us back, they try to bring us down
They try to tear us apart, tear it down
They try to tear us apart, they try to bring us down
They try to hold us back, tear it down
Show some love, tear it down, tear it down
Show some love, tear it down, tear it down

// Slam City //

We are gathered here, to get your slam on!
We're gonna do what we do... slam!
Slam city, slam city, slam city, slam!

We're thrashing around and something's 'bout to go down
If you can't take a hit
Then what the hell you doing going into the pit
Pain is the gift that used right won't let you quit
Bruises are the trophies won from the hits
So if you get into the way of what a pity
'Cause you know you'll be going down when we meet in slam city

Slam city, slam city, slam city, slam!

You're feeling the rage
You're loving flying off the stage
It's all such a blast
To knock someone silly when the groove kicks your ass

You can't blame us for blowing off some steam
You envy us for making our own scene
I said it all before and I'll say it again suicidal
We ain't here to mosh we fuckin' slam

Let's get this cyco pit
Going crazy with some cyco hits
Ready to get your slam on? Slam!
Slam city, slam city, slam city, slam!

We're holding it down
When the circle cloese all around
Now we're making a wall
And we're knocking over suckers like we're a human bowling ball

You can't blame us for blowing off some steam
You envy us for making our own scene "Cyco family"
So if you get in our way of what a pity
'Cause you know you'll be going down when we meet in slam city
This is the last chance
To get down with your slam dance
Hold it, hold it, hold it, slam!

Going on the attack, somebody's gonna get jacked
This punk ain't no punk
So you better move away or you're gonna get slam dunked

Slam! Slam! Slam city, slam! Slam! Slam city
Slam! Slam! Slam city, slam! Slam! Slam city
Get your slam on! Slam!

// Till My Last Breath //

Sunsets and butterflies don't exist in my world
Just trying to find something that to give me comfort as I hurt
This sadness and loneliness is like my siamese twins
But I'll never ever let... all this emptiness win
Till my last breath!

Till my last breath I'll be fighting mad
And you better believe I'll give it everything that I have
Till my last breath I'll refuse to retreat, and I ain't gonna be beat
No, no, no, no, no
Until my last breath I'll be a fighting man
Not just with my fist, but my mind and I got a plan
Till my last breath I'll be good to go, and everything should know
I got to get my mind to where my heart should be
To eliminate the hate, that get's the best to me
And what is left is the rest of necessity
To carry me on home

Till my last breath, I'm never letting go
Until my last breath, the whole world's gonna know
Until my last breath, I'll be keeping a score
Until my last breath, I'll be fighting for more

Until my last breath, I ain't nobodies bitch
Until my last breath, I'll keep pissin' on the rich
Until my last breath, I'm gonna do it, I ain't gonna just try
Until my last breath, I'm gonna hold my head up high
'Cause I know things ain't always gonna be the way that we want them to
And we're all gonna have to put up with something we don't wanna do
But let me tell you that's a hell of a lot better way
Then sitting on your ass and letting someone else lead the way fubb that

Till my last breath, I'm never letting go
Until my last breath, the whole world's gonna know
Until my last breath, I'll be keeping a score
Until my last breath, I'll be fighting for more

Sunsets and butterflies, slowly disappear
As screams from the underworld is all I seem to hear
Progress is slow to see, but yet I still believe
That if I fight the good fight
It'll never get the best of me!
Till my last breath

Never get the best of me, never get the best of me
Never get the best of me, never get the best of me

Till my last breath, until my last breath
Until my last breath, until my last breath
Never get the best of me!

// Living The Fight //

Living the fight, fighting to live
This ain't the end
Fighting to live, living the fight
This is where it begins
You got to make every single second count
You got to make every single heartbeat count
Fight to live, living the fight
It's headed straight for your mind
So many way it can take you out, it's a battle that we'll all face sometime

It's so hard to watch you fighting to live
I wish I could give you, the strength to begin
To win the battle of your demons & confront all your doubts
To remind you of what you should be and what really ruely counts

fighting to live, living the fight, fighting to live

Fighting to live, living the fight, do it again
Living the fight, fighting to live
Stay strong to the end
You gotta make every single moment count
You gotta make every single breath count

I'm so proud, to watch how your living the fight
To be so strong, against such odds, and to show so much might
Although it doesn't seem fair that anyone should have to face such a trial
You still counter the pain and anger with such an angelic smile

Fighting to live, living the fight, fighting to live

Living the fight, fighting to live
Fighting to live, leaving the fight
You got to make every single second count
Living the fight, fighting to live
Make every single moment count

// Life... (Can't Live With It, Can't Live Without It) //

Life, can't live with it, can't live without it
Life, can't live with it, can't live without it

I wish I could touch you, the way that you touched me
If I could have touched you, things would of ended up differently
All the sadness, all the regrets
All the what could have beens, and all the whit ifs?

You know that you touched me, and I'll never be the same
Now I wish I could touch you, 'cause all we feel is the blame

All the emotions, all the should have beens
All the remorse that forces all of this spin
All the confusion, all these questions that burn within

I wish I could touch you, we need to find your touch
How I wish I could touch you, we all need the touch
Now I wish I could touch you, we gotta find the touch
How I wish I could touch you, we need to feel the touch
Lord I wish you could touch us, we gotta find your touch
How I wish you would touch us

So don't you try to tell me, that it's all God's plan
'Cause I'm sure he's up there crying a whole lot more than I am
And if he exists, then it's always such a shame
'Cause how hard it must be to watch over all this pain
And I say this as a father and a son
Who never thought that he could be filled and touched with so much love
And I would do anything, give anthing at
'Cause it just tears me, how it scares me, that they won't be
Touched before they fall

Life, can't live with it, can't live without it
Life, can't live with it, can't live without it
