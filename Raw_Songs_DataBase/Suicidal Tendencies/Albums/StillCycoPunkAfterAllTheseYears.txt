// I Love Destruction //

Violence isn't the only option
Come on, fist teach your face

Destruction
I love destruction
Destruction

I like to pick a special something
I flick a switch and I blow it to nothing
I got a feeling that I can't resist
Feels so good to clench my fist
Doesn't really matter if I'm wrong or right
Just gives me an excuse for a fight
A violent rage comes over me
Now I'm headed to ecstasy cause

I love, I love destruction (destruction, destroy)
And all I need, all I need is destruction (destruction, I wanna destroy)

Destruction
I love destruction
Destruction

Looky there ain't that something
Looky now I blew it to nothing
Pretty people living pretty lives
Don't expect me to apologize cause

I love, I love destruction (destruction, destroy)
And all I need, all I need is destruction (destruction, destroy)
And when I bleed, I bleed destruction (destruction, destroy)
Cause I love, I love destruction (destruction, I wanna destroy)

Destruction
I love destruction
Destruction
Add a little self destruction

Worked its way from the back of my mind
Imagination that is so unkind
It doesn't take much to make the assumption
That I love, I love destruction

I love, I love destruction (destruction, destroy)
And all I need, all I need is destruction (destruction, destroy)
And when I bleed, I bleed destruction (destruction, destroy)
Cause I love, I love destruction (destruction, I wanna destroy)

Destruction
I love destruction
Destruction
I love destruction

Destruction
I love destruction
Destruction
I love destruction

// All Kinda Crazy //

All kinda crazy (crazy)
All kinda crazy (crazy)

You say violence, we say fun
You say violence, we say love
You say violence, we say fun
You say violence, now here it comes

Sitting around thinking about getting crazy
My right and wrong start duken' it out, they knock me hazy
Well I might not be the smartest one
But I got what it takes to get things done
Sitting around thinking all kinda crazy

You see violence, we see none
You see violence, we see fun
You see violence, we see lives
You see violence through closed eyes

Sitting around fighting off thoughts of going crazy
The hate I feel makes my conscience get lazy
The urges that I feel are not new to me
I've been there, done it, do it easily
Sitting around thinking all kinda crazy

You say violence, we say fun
You say violence, we say love
You say violence, we say fun
You say violence, now here it comes

All kinda crazy
All kinda crazy
All kinda crazy

(I) I fuckin' knew it
(My) mind says just screw it
(You) make me the maddest
(I) I fuckin' had it

Do you know what it's like?
You don't know what it's like
Wanna know what it's like?
I'll show you what it's like

(I) won't sit and take it
(Now) I'm gonna break it
(Why?) I have to do it
(There) ain't nothing to it

Sitting around thinking about getting crazy
The who, what, where, when, why, what? Doesn't even faze me

You see violence, we see none
You see violence, we see fun
You see violence, we see lives
You see violence through closed eyes

All kinda crazy
All kinda crazy
All kinda crazy
All kinda

You say violence (all kinda crazy)
We say fun (all kinda crazy)
You say violence (all kinda crazy)
We say love (all kinda crazy)

// Sippin' From The Insanitea //

You ever get that feeling? (Yeah)
You don't know what to do? (Yeah)
Cause every single moment feels
Like life is fuck'n over you! (No)
Don't you hate that feeling? (Yeah)
Can't fight it so you just pretend (No)
That it doesn't really exist
And soon it's all gonna end (It never ends!)
So you put that fake smile back on your face
And say that everything is all ok (No)
But all you really want to do
Is tell them all to get the fuck away! (Get the fuck away!)

Self fulfilled prophesy
Sippin' from the insanitea

Damn I hate that feeling (Yeah)
And here it comes again (No)
It feasts on hope and reason
Keeps pulling me closer to the end (When's it gonna end?)

Drowning in our agony
Sippin' from the insanitea

Damn I hate that feeling
And here it comes again!
Damn I hate that feeling
When's it gonna end?

Disappointments rising (Yeah)
Right before my eyes (No)
Anxiety is charging
Driven by the lies (Fuck'n lies)
Wicked like that nightmare
Destruction just for fun (No)
No one ever understands
A single thing I've done (No)

Cycosematic insanity
Cause everybody is fuck'n with me
Everybody keeps fuck'n with me
Sippin' from the insanitea

Looking past the future (No future)
Dead between the eyes (Rest in peace)
Everyone is triggered (Boom)
You're victims of your own lies (It's all lies!)

Damn I hate that feeling
And here it comes again!
Damn I hate that feeling
When's it gonna end?

Self fulfilled prophesy
Veins chained into the pharmacy
Cycosematic agony
Sippin' from the insanitea

And everybody is sippin'
From the insanitea
And everybody is trippin'
On hostility
And everybody is triggered
Self fulfilled prophesy
And everybody is sippin'
On the insanitea

// It's Always Something //

It's always something
It's always something
It's always something
It's always something

It's always something
It's always something
It's always something
It's always something

It's always something that does me wrong
I try to ditch it, it tags along
It's always something of that I'm sure
But I don't know why or what they were

Facing choices I can't make
Living up to another mistake
Problems building up in my face
The answers leave without a trace
It's always, always, always, always, always, always, always something

It's always something
It's always something

It's always something that's what I've found
When I start sailing it brings me down
It's always something happens to me
Can't find the honey but I've stung by the bee

Facing choices I can't make
Living up to another mistake
Playing games I don't wanna play
It's not worth it anyway
It's always, always, always, always, always, always, always something

It's always something

It's always something
It's always something
It's always something
It's always something

It's always something
It's always something
It's always something
It's always something

It's always something that comes my way
I try to ditch it, it wants to play
It's always something at least I know
I feel it coming I gotta go

Facing choices I can't make
Living up to another mistake
Problems building up in my face
The answers leave without a trace
Facing choices I can't make
Living up to another mistake
Playing games I don't wanna play
It's not worth winning anyway
It's always, always, always, always, always, always, always something

It's always something
It's always something

It's always something
It's always something
It's always something
It's always something

// Lost My Brain...Once Again //

Don't even know where did it go and I don't really care
A phony smile just takes a while, and then I'm out of there
Well I'm a certified nut and my thoughts are in a rut, but I gave it all then gave it again
No cure immature no excuse blame her, why play the game if you can't win?

I lost my brain once again
Well I lost my brain

Spinning around, lost what I found always a part of me
Ran out of luck runaway truck it's all the same to me
I guess my brain's been jacked but I don't really want it back, if you find it just throw it away
No time reward, I got all mine, if I change my mind I'll pick up a stray

Once again I lost my brain
Once again I lost my brain
Once again I lost my brain
Well I lost my brain
Well I lost my brain once again
And again, and again
Yeah I lost my brain once again
And again, and again
Yeah I lost my brain once again
And again, and again
Yeah I lost my brain

An empty space, a basket case born again lunatic
A screw is loose ripe for abuse an extra dosage of sick
I'm battered, hurt and pissed, take my pain with a twist, and I chill it with a scream on the rocks
Half full cerebral get set havoc rules, I'll drop the first person that talks

Once again I lost my brain
Once again I lost my brain
Once again I lost my brain
I lost it

Lost my brain once again
Well I lost my brain once again
And again, and again
Yeah I lost my brain once again
And again, and again
Yeah I lost my brain

Hole in my head, that's what I said and I don't carry no spare
Don't even know where did it go? But I don't really care
I'm a purebred mutt and I know you're thinking what but I gave it all and gave it again
Insane no brain cannot contain I haven't got the time for your pain

Once again I lost my brain
Once again I lost my brain
Once again I lost my brain
I lost my brain
Well I lost my brain once again
And again, and again
Yeah I lost my brain once again
And again, and again
Yeah I lost my brain once again
And again, and again
Well I lost my brain once again
And again, and again
Yeah I lost my brain once again
And again, and again
Well I lost my brain

Once again I lost my brain
Once again I lost my brain
Once again I lost my brain

// Nothin' To Lose //

Pissed of (once again)
Red line (never ends)
Hard times (wanna loose)
Make one (out of two)
Bring down (pay my dues)
Nothing I (get no clues)
Won't quit (win or lose)
Cyco punk attitude

You said you knew the right way
I followed you but I don't like where it got me
So trust me when I say it yes I mean it
This is the truth, there's no fine line in between it

Trust me I got nothing to lose

It's easy to choose when you've got nothing to lose

But you've got a whole world lot to lose

Trust me I got nothing to lose

Hard life? No I don't think so
It's different times and it's just the way that things go
Maybe I got it all wrong
I shouldn't care about their problems I'll just stay strong

It's easy to choose cause I've got nothing to lose

// Gonna Be Alright //

When life seems so weary
And the future looks dreary
If you listen you'll hear me
Say it's gonna be alright

It's gonna be, it's gonna be alright

Drenched in hypocrisy all hardened by the lunacy
But it's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
The truth is not pretty and the lies they come so easily
It's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
Always a part of me that screams to just let it be
It's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
When things don't go your way these three things you gotta say
It's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
Gonna be alright, gonna be alright

It's gonna be, it's gonna be alright
[?]

Grasp on to sacrifice if you fear it than you better think twice
It's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
Shame on the weaker ones when all is said and all is done
It's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
Stand up to the enemy I heard a voice it said to me
It's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
I know it's been said before but when you don't think you can take no more
It's gonna be alright, gonna alright
Gonna be alright, gonna be alright

It's gonna be, it's gonna be alright
[?]

Forsake the condition
A mental partition
Stay strong to the vision
It's gonna be

It's gonna be, it's gonna be alright

When your patience is spent just sit back and be content
It's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
Cause when the rain goes away it's gonna be a sunny day
It's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
Ain't got no quitter here, I'll shout it out loud and clear
It's gonna be alright, gonna be alright
When things don't go your way these three things I gotta say
It's gonna be alright, gonna alright
Gonna be alright, gonna be alright

It's gonna be, it's gonna be alright
[?]

It's gonna be, gonna be alright
It's gonna be, gonna be alright
It's gonna be, gonna be alright
It's gonna be, gonna be alright
Gonna be alright, gonna be alright

It's gonna be, it's gonna be alright
[?]

When life seems so weary
And the future looks dreary
If you listen you'll hear me
Say it's gonna be alright

// Ain't Gonna Get Me //

The days get long, start dragging on
They're out to get me
I contemplate the path of fate
Can't let them get me
I lost the feel, it turns surreal
Don't let 'em get me
The consequence remains in suspense
Ain't gonna get me!

They call it living, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me
They call it reason, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me

Society is against me
They're out to get me
To serve and protect? Yeah. What the neck?
Can't let them get me
They persecute but I dispute
Their right to get me
Not innocent but in my defense
Ain't gonna get me!

They call it reason, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me
They call it living, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me
They call it living, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me
They call it reason, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me

Ain't gonna get me

They call it reason, I call it lies
They call it reason, I call it lies
Won't let 'em get me
Pure hypocrites all full of shit
Can't let 'em get me!
Ain't gonna quit so deal with it
Won't let them get me
Now fully grown my anger's blowing
Ain't gonna get me

Ain't gonna get me, ain't gonna get me
Ain't gonna get me, ain't gonna get me
Ain't gonna get me, ain't gonna get me
Ain't gonna get me, ain't gonna get me

They call it reason, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me
They call it living, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me
They call it living, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me
They call it reason, I call it lies
Ain't gonna get me

Society is against me

// All I Ever Get //

All I ever hear is nothing
All I ever feel is nothing
All you ever say is nothing
All I ever get is nothing

No sense to me, it's just another rhyme
I try so hard but I just waste my time
All I want to get is something better
All I ever get is to wonder why

I'm on the path, the cradle to the tomb
And all the way that's where my anger looms
All I want to get is something better
All I even get is a lie
All I want to get is something better
All I ever get

All I ever get is nothing
All you ever say is nothing
All you ever do is nothing
All I ever get is nothing

All you ever say is nothing
All you ever do is nothing
All you ever think is nothing
All I ever get is nothing

All I get (all I get)
All I get (all I get)
All I get (all I get)
All I get (all I get)

All you ever say is nothing
All you ever do is nothing
All you ever think is nothing
All I ever get is nothing

All I get (all I get)
All I get (all I get)
All I get (all I get)
All I get (all I get)

All you ever say is nothing
All you ever do is nothing
All you ever think is nothing
All you ever give is nothing

All you ever do is nothing
All you ever say is nothing
All you ever think is nothing
All you ever give is nothing

// Save A Peace For Me //

The worst pain is when a tear leaves my eye
I try to fight it cause a grown man shouldn't cry
But when they start it seems I can't make it end
And when I do they just start up again
I try to fight it, I get in the stance
It takes my strength, leaves me deep in a trance
It suffocates me till I wither and wilt
It's the strongest feeling I've ever felt
Feel like a block that's being whittled away
But I'm still holding out for a peaceful day
Sometimes crushing, sometimes subtly
It weighs me down and leaves me empty

Save a peace for me
Save a peace for me
Save a peace for me

Save a peace for me
Save a peace for me
Save a peace for me

Fall to my knees past time to pray
My lips are sealed shut got noting to say
I spend my time trying to forget
All of the times that I felt like shit
Too many things that I did for fun
Now I know I never should have done
I look around, there's nothing to see
I look inside, I'm all empty

Running on empty,
So damn empty,
Hungry and empty,
Please save a peace for me

So many times I've wondered why
So many times I didn't care if I'd die
I learned the things that a sane man don't know
I've lived in places where the law's scared to go
I've seen lives prematurely be spent
I've bent my finger with full intent
I've had more than one intended for me
But I guess it wasn't meant to be

Running on empty,
So damn empty,
Hungry and empty,
Please save a peace for me

Save a peace for me
Save a peace for me

I look around, there's nothing to see
I look inside, I don't like me
I spend my time trying to forget
All of the times that I felt like shit
I may be proud but I need a lift
I'm holding out for a fulfilling gift
When I'm warmed by an inner smile
And that my soul is shining all the while

Save a peace for me,
Save a peace for me,
Save a peace for me,

Save a peace for me
Save a peace for me
Save a peace for me
Save me a peace

Running on empty,
So damn empty,
Hungry and empty,
Please save a peace for me
Please save a peace for me
Please save a peace for me
