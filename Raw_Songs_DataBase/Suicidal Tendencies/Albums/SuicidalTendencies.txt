Album: SuicidalTendencies

// Memories Of Tomorrow //

B-1 bombers in flight
Trident missiles in the air
MX missiles underground
Protect us till we're dead

Memories of tomorrow - too late for sorrow

Push the button
Kiss good-bye the nuclear arsenal
A-bombs flying off their ramps
Nuclear bombs explode

Radio active people
Search for medicine
Pray for shelter
Kill for food

Mass starvation
Contaminated water
Destroyed cities
Mutilated bodies

I'll kill myself
I'd rather die
If you could see in the future
You'd know why

// Possessed //

When I go down the street
The people watch me shiver and shake
I'm a prisoner of a demon
I think my head's about to break
It stays with me wherever I go
I can't break away from its hold
This must be my punishment
For selling my soul

Too much pressure, my pulse is rising
My heart is pounding, my head really hurts
I can't take it, all this pressure
From all these things inside of me
Everywhere I look I see them
Everywhere I go they're at
What did I do to deserve this
Why won't they just leave my body

Are they people or are they spirits
Do they belong to the human race
Why do they want me so bad
Why won't they come out of their hiding place
i can't see them, but I know they're here
i can feel it in my veins
All this pressure on my body
Is causing all my strength to drain

Am I crazy, or am I insane
Or have I already lost my mind
Is it real, or is it fake
Or am I in a permanent bind
Am I in power or am I a slave
Who in hell is in control
Am I still living, or am I dead
Do I still have a soul

I know I can't keep going this way
I have to give my mind some leisure
If I keep on going like this
I never again will taste pleasure
If they will not break the oath
I will have to disband
I have lost all control
this thing has now taken command

// Fascist Pig //

Tense atmosphere in the air
Riot written everywhere
Riot squads coming from over there
Time to go home if you're square

Riot squad, bash their heads
Kick their ass until they're dead
I want to be a fascist pig
Love to fight, what a thrill
We don't stop until we kill
I want to be a fascist pig

Throw a bottle in the air
Put them up to their dare
We'll just laugh while they stare
Let them hit us, see if we care!

Get attacked by them
You'll never heal
They'll rob your conscience
Your sanity they'll steal
They'll beat your brains until they spill
That's the fascist favorite meal!

// I Want More //

Don't wanna pump nobody's gas I want more
Don't wanna kiss my bosses ass I want more
Don't wanna take the first job I find I want more
Don't wanna dig coal out of a mine I want more

Slaving in a factory a different kind of insanity
Feels like I'm locked in a cage
Working like a maniac, gave myself a heart attack
For a job that pays minimum wage

Don't wanna work at the golden arches I want more
Don't wanna wash rich mans cars I want more
Don't wanna be nobody's gardener I want more
Don't wanna be a garbage man I want more

// Suicidal Failure //

Father forgive me for I know not what I do
I tried everything, but I'll leave it up to you
I don't want to live, I don't know why
I don't have no reasons, I just want to die

I'm a suicidal failure, I've got to get some help
I have suicidal tendencies, but I can't kill myself

I'm tired of this way of life, my patience has expired
I'm barely just 19, but my life I will retire
I went down to a rifle store, I bought myself a gun
I pointed it at my head, but I couldn't get the job done

I took all my mothers sleeping pills
I jumped off a freeway bridge
I drank three kinds of poison
And drove my car off a ridge
I beat myself with a bat
Put a noose around my head
I overdosed on heroin
But I'm still not dead

Death may not be the answer, it can't be all that great
But me I'm not into living, with life I can't relate
By some masochistic reasoning, I think that it will be fun
I want to start my second life now
So shoot me with your gun

// Suicide's An Alternative //

Sick of people - no ones real
Sick of chicks - they're all bitches
Sick of you - you're too hip
Sick of life - it sucks

Suicide's an alternative

Sick of trying - what's the point
Sick of talking - no one listens
Sick of listening - it's all lies
Sick of thinking - just end up confused
Sick of moving - never get no where
Sick of myself - don't wanna live
Sick and tired - and no one cares
Sick of life - it sucks

Sick of politics - for the rich
Sick of power - only oppresses
Sick of government - full of tyrants
Sick of school - total brainwash
Sick of music - top 40 sucks
Sick of myself - don't wanna live
Sick and tired - and no one cares
Sick of life - it sucks

Suicide's an alternative

Sick of life - it sucks
Sick and tired - and no one cares
Sick of myself - don't wanna live
Sick of living - I'm gonna die

// Two-Sided Politics //

I'm not anti-society, society's anti-me
I'm not anti-religion, religion is anti-me
I'm not anti-tradition, tradition is anti-me
I'm not anti-anything, I just wanna be free

Fascist state, no freedom
Unless you control yourself
Use self expression, lose your freedom
You're undesirable, you go straight to jail

Kill someone, in a war
Get a medal, you're a hero
Protect yourself in every day war
You're undesirable you go straight to jail

I'm not anti-Reagan, Reagan's anti-me
I'm not anti-government, government's anti-me
I'm not anti-politics, politics is anti-me
I'm not anti-anything, I just wanna be free

Innocent, never guilty
High class lawyer, you are rich
If you're poor must be guilty
Even if innocent you go straight to jail

// I Shot Reagan //

I shot Reagan I shot Sadat
I'm gonna shoot you dead in heaven you'll rot
You're gonna rot in heaven, hear an Angels voice
You're too bad for hell although it's your first choice

Rot in heaven, you're too bad for hell
Rot in heaven, cause you're forgiven in hell

I shot Lennon, I shot the Pope
I shot the devil now you ain't got no hope
You're gonna rot in heaven, hear an Angels voice
You're too bad for hell although it's your first choice

// Subliminal //

Flashing pictures on my screen
Shown too quickly to be seen
Does not register in my conscious mind
Propaganda of another kind
They're Fucking with me subliminally
They're Fucking with me subliminally

Danger - Nightmare
Doomsday - Nightmare
Murder - Nightmare
Nightmare, Nightmare

Watching T.V. I start to cry
For no reason I don't know why
Could it be from messages on my TV
Which I'm getting subliminally?

Mind control the easiest way
Sponsored by the C.I.A.
It's a weapon you cannot see
It's propaganda subliminally

// Won't Fall In Love Today //

Baby don't you be blue
You know that I'll always be true
You know that I'll always love you
And we'll always be together too

Over a thousand things I can say to you
Half of which would be un-true
But the one thing for sure I can say
Is that I won't fall in love today

Baby when you hold me tight
You know everything will be alright
So let's not take any time to fight
Because you know I love you with all my might

Baby you make me feel like a man
When we're rolling in the sand
So come and take me by the hand
And do the things you know we can
