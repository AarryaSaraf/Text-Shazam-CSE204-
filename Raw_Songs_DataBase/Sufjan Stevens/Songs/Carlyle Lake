Oh, stop thinking of tomorrow

Don't stop thinking of today

You're not getting any younger

You've got nothing to explain

You've got resolutions

Fastening in your wake

Take instead the high tide

At the man-made lake

It may take a while

It may take all day

All the implications

At the man-made lake

Oh stop thinking of tomorrow...
