If I was a dif-ferent man,
If I had blood in my-ay-ay-ay,eyes -
I could have read of your heart,
I could have read of your eyes -
But now I'm lonely as that,
I put up a fi-i-i-i-ight -
So pick up your battering ram -
Lo-o-o-o-o-ove, I wanna see it:


There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love.
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love.
There's too much riding on that,
There's too much, too much, too much love.
There's too much riding on that anyway-eyay-ay

And maybe I talk too fast,
Maybe I talk too-o mu-u-uch -
Give me the sensitive laugh,
Or give me the sensiti-ive to-o-ouch -
Even if I could have kissed,
Even if I couldn't apply,
I'm so sorry I tried lo-o-o-o-o-ove, I wanna see it -



Too much love
Too much lo-o-o-ove
Too much love
Too much lo-o-o-ove
Too much love
Too much lo-o-o-ove
Too much love
Too much love
 'love' faintly




Na, na na, na, na, na, na 
Meanwhile, another singer is singing:
'La-aaia-a-aaia' 




There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that word ...




There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that,
There's too much riding on that, there's too much riding on that.
