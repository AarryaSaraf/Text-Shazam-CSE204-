What child is this who lays to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepards watch are keeping

This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepards guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring him love
The Babe, the Son of Mary

Why lies he in such mean estate,
Where ox and ass are feeding?
Good Christians, fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading

Nails, spear shall pierce Him through,
The cross be borne for me, for you.
Hail, hail the Word made flesh,
The Babe, the Son of Mary.

So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,
Come peasant, king to own Him;
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
