Arnica might take out the throes that I threw in my head
Bruno, your wife shakes her bedclothes as she makes up the bed

I'm tired of life; I'm tired of waiting for someone
I'm tired of prices; I'm tired of waiting for something

I have a right to know what's in store; to know what should be said
Could I have it all for a night to have slept in the warmth of your bed?

I'm tired of life; I'm tired of waiting for someone
I'm tired of prices; I'm tired of waiting for something
I'm tired of life; I'm tired of life, etc.

Oh be patient with me; for the night weighs on my chest with a terrible storm
Though we may disagree on how things should be done on how crisis is born
Don't consider it done wait until Leviathan lovingly creeps in your sill
For he waits in the dark, brooding magically; mustering paperback feelings

No I'm not afraid of death or strife or injury, accidents, they are my friends...
