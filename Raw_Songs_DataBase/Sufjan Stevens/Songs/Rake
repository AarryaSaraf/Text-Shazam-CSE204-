I never felt so safe

A line I once told her

Warm resting place

Her arm on my shoulder


you are the rock

you are the rake

you are the one when I watch myself

you are the rock

you are the rake

you are the one when I watch myself


we ran into a cave

when the wars came closer

she turned into a cave

where it turned colder


you are the rock

you are the rake

you are the one when I watch myself

you are the rock

you are the rake

you are the one when I watch myself


you are the rock

you are the rake

you are the one when I watch myself

you are the rock

you are the rake

you are the one when I watch myself
