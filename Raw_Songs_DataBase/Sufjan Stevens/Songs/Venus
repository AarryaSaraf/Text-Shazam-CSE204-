Oh no
There I go twisting your arm
Oracle ghost
Love me completely in song
Methodist summer camp
You show me yours, show you mine
Sensitive thunderclap
Slip beneath sleeping bag spine
Run, radiator, run
Redheaded, horny-eyed friend
Run Taurobolium
Blood that ran off from the stem

Go slow
Pandemos, fill of me
Cherokee jeep in the yard
Pull off your running shoes
Sweet Callipygian, guardian goddess
My guard

Half shell
Half undressed lover of mine
Born Aphrogenia
Jealousy drink of your wine

Crazed nymphomania
Touch me if touching's no sin
Heart shaped
Anemone felt from within

Don't go
Pandemos, fill of me
I never meant to do harm to you, to love
Don't go
Pandemos, fill of me
I never meant to do harm to you, to love
