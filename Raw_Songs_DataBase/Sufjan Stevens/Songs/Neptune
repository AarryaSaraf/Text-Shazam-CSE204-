What's right
And what's wrong?
Don't you hold me too tightly
Two words as I've rounded them off
To the nearest of ten

For I gathered your body
In envious capture
In envious thought

Oh forgive me, oh gods
Or forgive me in fortune
Forgive me in feeling it out for myself
As I ought to have feelings for something
As great as thou art

Some great white rose
Of youth, your pleasure
Gives my own arm
Generous portions, wisely
Breaks of my own heart
I felt the arm's length
While I've gone on my own way

Conserve me, strange waters
Come and obey me, strange waters
Have it your own way

So if you won't hold me
I have no objections
So if you won't please me
I have no commands
So if you don't trust me
It's best if I drown
