In the future, there will be no war
The loneliness outside
And the stones cry out for mercy
Will they see the Lord
The prophecy grows sight
As it is written
I am the God of war
I reside in every creature
Dispose of the future
Or put away your sword

Until the future
There will only be war
The ugliness inside
And after all the devastation
Will we see the Lord
As it is written
I am the future
I am the God of war
I reside in every creature
Dispose of the future
Or put away your sword
