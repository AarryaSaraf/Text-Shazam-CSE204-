A government has gone this far
A covenant prepared to part
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me

If I'm alone in saying, "yes"
I'll change my views and try my best
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me
Peace to me

Take it only if you boldly
Cannot take it
(Jumps and lonely)
Presidents and magistration
Spend on golf
And spring vacation
(Peace to me!
We are the holy ones!)
