We had friends downstate
When we drove we went to Canada
If we were asked to stay
I was brave
I was brave
I was brave

From the top of the mountain
You could see
Lake Erie
Niagara Falls
From the top of the fountain
I could see farther than anyone

Driving through the line
We pretend we are from Africa
If we fall far behind
I am brave
I am brave
I am brave
