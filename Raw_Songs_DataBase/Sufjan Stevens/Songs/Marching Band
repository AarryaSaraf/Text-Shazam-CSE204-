One dark day the trees began a trumpet sound, 
trumpet sound 
We sat listening patiently, the sky was near 
and I felt the trembling motion 
we ran out to see the future, from the ground 
from the ground 
from the ground 
from the ground 
people died and people risen everywhere 
We held hands and made a circle 
quietly from the ground 
quietly from the ground 
We returned and set the table, by the door
