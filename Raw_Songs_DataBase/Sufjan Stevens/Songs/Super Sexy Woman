She's a super human girl

She is super woman.

She is Superman's cousin

She's got superpower lovin'


She's got super human eyes

For seein' through superhuman vision

She's got super human thighs

Sexier than television


She is super duper smart,

I like her for her mind

She'll shoot a super fart,

The deadly silent kind


She's got super human lips, for super suction

She's got super power hips, for super reproduction


She's a super human girl,

She is super woman.

She is Superman's cousin

She's got superpower lovin'


She's got super human eyes

To see through super human vision

She's got super human thighs,

Sexier than television.


She's a lot like Catwoman

Just without the leather

She likes whips and chains

And an electronic feather.


She's got a super long tongue

And spandex underwear

She's got Superman's smile

And Wonderwoman's hair.


She's a super human girl,

She is super woman.

She is Superman's cousin

She's got superpower lovin'


She's got super human eyes

To see through super human vision

She's got super human thighs,

Sexier than television.


She is Supergirl, Superwoman, Supersexywomannnnn...
