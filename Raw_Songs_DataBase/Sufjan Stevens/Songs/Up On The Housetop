Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones, Christmas joys
Who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go?
Oh, oh, oh, who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go?

First comes the stocking of little Nell
Oh, dear Santa fill it well
Give her a dolly that laughs and cries
One that can open and shut its eyes
Who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go?
Oh, oh, oh, who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go?

Next comes the stocking of little Will
Oh, just see what a glorious fill
Here is a hammer and lots of tacks
Whistle, and ball, and a set of jacks
Who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go?
Oh, oh, oh, who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go?

Up on the housetop, spirit of the dead
Anyone particular, everyone fed
I'm in the doorstop holding it down
Waiting for a miracle, waiting for a crowd

One of the scenario, thinking up a cause
Anyone particular, any old cause
Hands on the counter, feet on the floor
Moving to the kitchen and you get your passport

Up on the housetop, spirit of the dead
Down through the chimney is what the man said

Up on the housetop reindeer pause
Out jumps good old Santa Claus
Down through the chimney with lots of toys
All for the little ones, Christmas joys
Who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go?
Oh, oh, oh, who wouldn't go? Who wouldn't go?

Up on the housetop, spirit of the dead
Down through the chimney is what the man said
