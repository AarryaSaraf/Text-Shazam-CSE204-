Something suddenly unclear
Someone suddenly my fear
My eyes demand like broken eaves
The laddle over spills on eaves

If you once knew
How I loved you

And my bruise-colored eyes peeled
Every image to your face and heel
And if you're happy I am, too
And if you're sleeping I'm with you

But you love someone else
But you want to be with someone else
And I can't believe how dumb I sound
And I put my face over the ground
