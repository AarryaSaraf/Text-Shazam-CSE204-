Is the tale of Banks & Conley
The two greatest outlaws America's ever seen
They tied the ropes, down they went
And all they found were sheets in the wind
(Aw, they were blowing)
On the 20th floor, smack downtown
They changed their clothes from white to brown
Caught a cab, and headed south
Way out to Conley's grandma's house
The trail was hot
"You can't stay," Granny turned them both away
They split up, separate ways
Been on the lam about 10 days
They busted out, love in the air
We're all in search of the lion's share


We're all in search of the lion's share
(Give me the lion's share)
We're all in search of the lion's share
(Give me the lion's share)
(Dance, dance)
Put the money in your pants
(Run, run)
We can all get some
(Give me the lion's share)

Is the the tale of Banks & Conley
The two greatest outlaws America's ever seen
They tied the sheets, smack downtown
Jails can't hold these fellas down
Banks had the loot stashed in the safe
In a backyard in the Buckeye State
He picked and picked
Moon lights the air
Work that back for the lion's share
(Give me the lion's share)
Work that back for the lion's share
(Give me the lion's share)
Work that back for the lion's share
Work that back for the lion's share
They both got lost, love in the air
We're all in search of the lion's share



Work that back for the lion's share 
Work that back for the lion's share 
Work that back for the lion's share 
Work that back for the lion's share 
Work that back for the lion's share 
Work that back for the lion's share 
Work that back for the lion's share 

Get the loot, call for Conley
Lovers live in this economy
Let's all get lost, love in the air
We're all in search of the lion's share


We're all in search of the lion's share
(Give me the lion's share)
We're all in search of the lion's share
(Give me the lion's share)
(Dance, dance)
With the booty in your pants
(Run, run)
We can all get some
(Give me the lion's share)
