All things past in the pick-up

Found my brother's badge

Abraham is live and well in the pick-up

And his wife casts no more spells

In the pick-up


Found myself in the pick-up

Seatbelt on my lap

And my sister with her braids

In the pick-up

Kissed my mother on the face

In the pick-up

Clapping with the human race

In the pick-up
