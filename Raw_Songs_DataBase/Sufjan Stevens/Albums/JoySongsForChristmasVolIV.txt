// The Little Drummer Boy //

Come they told me, pa rum pum pum pum
A new born King to see, pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the King, pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum

So to honor Him, pa rum pum pum pum
When we come

Little Baby, pa rum pum pum pum
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pum pum pum
I have no gift to bring, pa rum pum pum pum
That's fit to give our King, pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum

Shall I play for you, pa rum pum pum pum
On my drum?

Mary nodded, pa rum pum pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pum pum pum
I played my drum for Him, pa rum pum pum pum
I played my best for Him, pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum

Then He smiled at me, pa rum pum pum pum
Me and my drum

// Away In A Manger //

Away in a manger, 
no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus 
laid down his sweet head

The stars in the sky 
looked down where he lay
The little Lord Jesus 
asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing, 
the baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus, 
no crying he makes

I love thee, Lord Jesus; 
look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle 
until morning is night

Be near me, be near me,
Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus,
I ask you to stay

Close by me, close by me
Forever, Forever, 
and love me, I pray
and love me, I pray
and love me, I pray

// Hey Guys! It's Christmas Time! //

We can walk out after dark,
Because it's Christmas time
Colored lights glow from the park,
Because it's Christmas time.
And the bells on the reindeer sled say, 
It's Christmas time
And the quilt on the back of the bed say,
It's Christmas time

I think about how we could run away,
Now that it's Christmas time
We travel in a one horse open sleigh, 
Now that it's Christmas time

There's your father with his pipe,
He says it's Christmas time
He might let us stay up all night,
Because it's Christmas time
I might wish you all the best 
Because it's Christmas time
I might kiss you on the back of your neck 
Because it's Christmas time

I think about how we could run away, 
Now that it's Christmas time
We travel in a one horse open sleigh, 
Now that it's Christmas time

It's Christmas time

// Did I Make You Cry On Christmas Day? (Well, You Deserved It!) //

This time of year you always disappear
You tell me not to call
You tell me not to call
And when the door is closed you're wearing different clothes
Or hiding in the paper pretending not to hear

Inexpensive wine
I buy it all the time
You tell me take it back
You say you'll take a nap
But I can see it now 
You always tell me how 
I could do so much better 
You said it in your letter

Did I make you cry
on Christmas day?
Did I let you down
Like every other day?
Did I make you cry
on Christmas day?
Did I let you down
On Christmas day?

The bed that isn't made
The broken window shade
The radiator's on
I loved you along
But I can see it now
You always tell me how
I could do so much better
You said it in your letter

I stay awake at night
After we have a fight
I'm writing poems about you
And they aren't very nice
I didn't mean to yell
I said I couldn't tell
I only grabbed your wrist
Or would you rather we kissed?

Did I make you cry 
On Christmas day?
Did I make you cry
Like every other day?
Did I make you cry
On Christmas day?
Did I make you cry?
