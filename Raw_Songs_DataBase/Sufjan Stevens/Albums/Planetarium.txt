// Neptune //

What's right
And what's wrong?
Don't you hold me too tightly
Two words as I've rounded them off
To the nearest of ten

For I gathered your body
In envious capture
In envious thought

Oh forgive me, oh gods
Or forgive me in fortune
Forgive me in feeling it out for myself
As I ought to have feelings for something
As great as thou art

Some great white rose
Of youth, your pleasure
Gives my own arm
Generous portions, wisely
Breaks of my own heart
I felt the arm's length
While I've gone on my own way

Conserve me, strange waters
Come and obey me, strange waters
Have it your own way

So if you won't hold me
I have no objections
So if you won't please me
I have no commands
So if you don't trust me
It's best if I drown

// Jupiter //

My father, working nights
First shift, eternal light
The curse of Adam labor
Outside, in the parking lot
The current of wind and the light went hot
He held his head in terror
By jove and by surprise
The current of lightning filled with light
It burned his hands with symbols
White noise as Lucifer
The sacred fire, the sacred fern
Conceived with holy water

His radiance in the dark
Mysterious shape or beauty mark
As if it were Minerva
Breastplate of Jupiter
The hovering deep, he spoke the word
The light, the virgin creature
All dreams and all disease are fantasy features, ill-conceived
Illusions worth remembering

My father, late at night
Forbidding death, he kissed the light
As Jupiter transfigured

I need you to change me, prevent you, persuade me
By jove
I need you, sensation, my virtue, persuasion
By jove

Father of light
Father of death
Give us your wisdom, give us your breath
Summoner says that Jupiter is the loneliest planet
Red right eye
Put in its place
Under your foot, carpenter's cape
Sermon of death says Jupiter is the loneliest planet
Floundering star
Failed that you are
Fevering pitch
Figure of speech
Sermon of death says Jupiter is the loneliest planet

Say it with faith
Say it with force
Say it to my face
Put me in place
Sermon of death says Lucifer is the only conquest
Hurricane heart, hurricane haste
Wandering star, pick up your pace
Sermon of death says Jupiter is the only contest
Father of light
Father of death
Give us your wisdom, give us your breath
Sermon of death says Jupiter is the loneliest planet

// Venus //

Oh no
There I go twisting your arm
Oracle ghost
Love me completely in song
Methodist summer camp
You show me yours, show you mine
Sensitive thunderclap
Slip beneath sleeping bag spine
Run, radiator, run
Redheaded, horny-eyed friend
Run Taurobolium
Blood that ran off from the stem

Go slow
Pandemos, fill of me
Cherokee jeep in the yard
Pull off your running shoes
Sweet Callipygian, guardian goddess
My guard

Half shell
Half undressed lover of mine
Born Aphrogenia
Jealousy drink of your wine

Crazed nymphomania
Touch me if touching's no sin
Heart shaped
Anemone felt from within

Don't go
Pandemos, fill of me
I never meant to do harm to you, to love
Don't go
Pandemos, fill of me
I never meant to do harm to you, to love

// Uranus //

What are you now?
Castrated by your son
The odd spring scattered on the deep
From Aphrodesia

You sexless fraud
From chaos choreographed
Defiled us in a fit of rage
The earth will find its way

Violent storm, from mysterious vengeance lies
Born from incest, as the evidence flipped its eyes

Cross me with your wildness
Snake-eyed warrior's knife

Aquarius
The scorpion
Your venom kiss
My guardian
I trust your touch
I trust your cries
Render the knife
Cut off my kind

My, you, they, we, us
My, you, they, we, us
My, you, they, we, us
My, you, they, we, us

// Mars //

In the future, there will be no war
The loneliness outside
And the stones cry out for mercy
Will they see the Lord
The prophecy grows sight
As it is written
I am the God of war
I reside in every creature
Dispose of the future
Or put away your sword

Until the future
There will only be war
The ugliness inside
And after all the devastation
Will we see the Lord
As it is written
I am the future
I am the God of war
I reside in every creature
Dispose of the future
Or put away your sword

// Sun //

Love, peace, forgiveness
And consequence
And trust, and patience, affection
Determining how long
I hold you in as compensate
Contemplate, rhapsody
Energy in tow
The things to look for

Love and peace, forgiveness
And consequence
And trust, and patience, affection
Determining how long
I hold you in as compensate
Contemplate, rhapsody
Energy in tow
The things to look for

Love, I hold you in as
Fantasy, blasphemy
Fallacy, and probably as fate
These are the names for love

// Moon //

Jack rabbit trumped with a generous mood
Offering itself on the fire for food
Touched by his virtue, the fortune approved
Outlining ears on the virtuous moon
As I'm about to enter your world
As I'm about to enter your world
I give you light

Some say the crane was the call for two
Stretched by the weight as her legs withdrew
Carrying the chariot, the rabbit assumed
Washing her face with the redheaded hubris
As I'm about to enter your world
As I'm about to enter your world
I give you blood
