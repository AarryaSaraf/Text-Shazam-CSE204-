// Silent Night //

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night holy night 
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia
Christ the Savior is born 
Christ the Savior is born

// Angels We Have Heard On High //

Angels we have heard on high
Singing for the earth's attention
And the mountains in reply
So much noise for my affection

Shepherds, why this jubilee
Have you seen a flying saucer?
And what the gladsome tidings be
Is it power and wealth you're after?

Gloria, it speaks of pure devotion
Gloria, the counting and commotion
Gloria, I cannot stand to listen
Gloria, it takes from my ambition
Gloria

Come to Bethlehem and see
The Son of God inside a manger
Come, adore on bended knee
Where dreams become your greatest danger

Gloria, it puts your heart in motion
Gloria, like some romantic notion
Gloria, it gives a great petition
Gloria, and takes from your ambition
Gloria

Gloria
Gloria
Gloria
Gloria
Gloria

// Hark! The Herald Angels Sing //

Hark the herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King!
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled!"
Joyful, all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With the angelic host proclaim
"Christ is born in Bethlehem"

Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King!" 

Christ by highest heav'n adored
Christ the everlasting Lord
Late in time behold Him come
Offspring of a virgin's womb
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see
Hail the incarnate Deity
Pleased with us in flesh to dwell
Jesus, our Immanuel

Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the newborn King!"
