Look closer
Through the trees
Do you see it?

// Midnight Summer Jam //

Y'all can't do better than this
Y'all can't do better than this
Y'all can't do better than this
Act like the south ain't the shit
Act like the south ain't the shit
Act like the south ain't the shit
Y'all can't do better than this
Y'all can't do better than this
Act like the south ain't the shit, wait

It's just a midnight summer's jam
The air's so thin, but we don't give a damn
The starry sky across the night
Where we pretend it's our last chance to dance

It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight

It's in the air, hospitality
Anything you want, what's mine is yours
But don't you worry about the way I talk, woo
It's where I'm from, come and get you some, uh
Hey, all of the locals are happy to get out and meet a new face
We dance in circles, on and on, dosey-do and then we sway
Even the old folks'll come out and rock
And we just hopin' the music don't stop 'til the next day

It's just a midnight summer's jam
The air's so thin, but we don't give a damn
The starry sky across the night
Where we pretend it's our last chance to dance

It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight

Y'all can't do better than this
Y'all can't do better than this
Y'all can't do better than this
Act like the south ain't the shit
Act like the south ain't the shit
Act like the south ain't the shit
Y'all can't do better than this
Y'all can't do better than this
Act like the south ain't the shit
Act like the south ain't the shit
Act like the south ain't the, south ain't the...
(Summer nights) I love those
(Summer nights) I love those
(Summer nights) I love those
(Summer nights) it's sweaty out here, baby

Go hard
(I glow, I glow, I glow, I glow...)
Go, go hard
(I glow, I glow, I glow, I glow...)
Brother E, hit me with somethin'

Ugh, come on

I don't like it, I love it, ugh
(I glow, I glow, I glow, I glow...)
Ugh, come on, move somethin'
(I glow, I glow, I glow, I glow...)

Wait, it's just a midnight summer's jam
The air's so thin, but we don't give a damn
The starry sky across the night
Where we pretend it's our last chance to dance

It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight
It starts at midnight, midnight, midnight

Start it over
(I glow, I glow, I glow, I glow...)

(I glow, I glow, I glow, I glow...)
Yeah, come on

Get up and move somethin'
(I glow, I glow, I glow, I glow...)
Uh huh

And we ain't goin' home no time soon
(I glow, I glow, I glow, I glow...)
Uh huh, move somethin'
(I glow, I glow, I glow, I glow...)

After midnight, please don't stop the music
Move somethin', midnight, please don't stop the music
Shake somethin', midnight, please don't stop the music
Feels good, midnight, please don't stop the music

// Sauce //

[Gino Russ:]
Juice, juice is temporary, you know. Anyone can obtain the juice or something
I mean, you could say that just 'cause you got a nice car or something, like
"Oh, man, he got the juice," you know, it's something that kind of comes and goes
But the sauce, the sauce is forever

Ooh, sauce
Uh, you got all of it
Yeah
You know, you got all of it
You got all of it
Go 'head

Ooh, I love your pink, you like my purple
You must be God herself, can I come worship?
Let's make some new details, just for your journal
'Cause you keep lookin' at me with those eyes like you know somethin' I don't
So, go ahead, say I won't
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it, throw away that phone
'Cause I know you miss your snap on a lover, and I can name three or four
But you keep lookin' at me with those eyes like you know somethin' I don't

Hold up
Ooh, ooh, somethin' comes over me
It's always loose screws when you get close to me
It's like too much to describe, yeah, it's enough for two lives
And I could never spend all of it but at least I'm gon' try

Ooh, I love your pink, you like my purple
That color right between those, that's where I worship
Let's make some new details up in your journal
'Cause you keep lookin' at me with those eyes like you know somethin' I don't
So, go ahead, say I won't
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it, throw away that phone
'Cause I know you miss your snap on a lover, and I can name three or four
But you keep lookin' at me with those eyes like you know somethin' I don't

Hold up
Ooh, ooh, somethin' comes over me
It's always loose screws when you get close to me
It's like too much to describe, yeah, it's enough for two lives
And I could never spend all of it but at least I'm gon' try

Four times, huh
Yeah, break it down, woo!
Uh

So, so, so, go ahead
Say I won't
Ain't nothin' to it but to do it, throw away that phone
'Cause I know you miss your snap on a lover, and I can name three or four
But you keep lookin' at me with those eyes like you know somethin' I don't

Hold up
Ooh, ooh, somethin' comes over me
It's always loose screws when you get close to me
It's like too much to describe, yeah, it's enough for two lives
And I could never spend all of it but at least I'm gon' try
Ooh, ooh, somethin' comes over me (over me)
It's always loose screws when you get close to me (yeah)
It's like too much to describe, yeah, it's enough for two lives
And I could never spend all of it but at least I'm gon' try

Ooh, sauce
You got all of it, go 'head

Go 'head, you got all of it, huh

Go 'head, you got all of it, uh

// Man Of The Woods //

I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

Hey, sugar plum, look at where we are
So tonight, if I take it too far
That's okay because you know
(That's okay because you know)
I hear the making up's fun
Been a minute since we've had some time to breathe
So if you see another side of me
That's okay because you know
(That's okay because you know)
I hear the making up's fun

But then your hands talking, fingers walking
Down your legs, hey, there's the faucet
Someone's knocking like they know
But baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching
Your hand slides down the light
And girl you know

I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

Well, I got your sweet with a twist of lime
And this one's neat, well you know that's mine, here we go
And do it twice 'cause you know we like it
And damn anybody if they disagree
They don't understand you're just like me, they don't know
We do it twice 'cause we know we like it

But then your hands talking, fingers walking
Down your legs, hey, there's the faucet
Someone's knocking like they know
But baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching
Your hand slides down the light (light, light, light)
And girl you know

I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

How do I ever explain what I've got with you?
I try to find the words but they hide and that's the truth
And nobody ever will understand what we do
There's only one me and you
Come here, hold me
'Cause there's only one me and you
Yeah, there's only one me and you, uh
There's only one me and you
You know there's only one me and you

I brag about you to anyone outside (anyone outside)
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride (it's my pride)
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

I wrote this to let you know
And I let them feelings show
I'm the man of the woods and you're my pride
Ooh, I can't make them understand
But you know I'm a Southern man
A man of the woods and you're my pride
Ohh, hey, hey
A man of the woods, it's my pride
Now let the beat ride like...

// Higher, Higher //

Uh, stress is cruel, fame's a lie
But you're special, on every level
Success is cool, money is fine
But you're special, another level

Listen
I see the man, they wanna touch ya
That's when I tell 'em, "uh-uh"
I guess I am a jealous lover
'Cause I ain't sharin' with another...

Stress is cruel, fame's a lie
But you're special, on every level
Success is cool, and money is fine
But you're special, another level

I guess you can say I was lovestruck
I met you, you was with your brother
I had to go and get my cousin
Tell a joke and then say, "What's up?"
We both danced to "Lucky Star"
Eyeing each other, then we're laughin'
I might as well have been some butter
Melting all over, girl, what?
Ooh, you are that thunder, lightnin'
I need it to get out the darkness
My body told me I was done, but
I think it meant to say in trouble

If it's for you, it can't be any old thing...

You said get used to change
Nothing would be the same
And we're climbing, once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
To them we might look strange
It's somethin' you can't explain
And we're climbing, once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing, once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing, once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher

Stress is cruel (stress is cruel)
Fame's a lie (fame's a lie)
But you're special (but you're special)
On every level (on every level)
Success is cool (success is cool)
And money is fine (money is fine)
But you're special (but...)
Another level (another level)

Sugar
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
Ay, sugar
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
Hey
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
It can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
I said come on
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
I said, sugar, come on
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing
If it's for you, it can't be any old thing

You said get used to change
Nothing would be the same
And we're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
To them we might look strange
It's somethin' you can't explain
And we're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
We're climbing once again
Gettin' higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher
Ooh, higher, higher, higher

// Wave //

Yeah
This is?
Yeah, come on, go...
Wave...

Let's go to an island
Like we did last year, catch a vibe
The dreamiest weather
Gon' do a spa and bonfires

I got rose-colored glasses
Batten your eyelashes
Come on, don't be passive
So last time will be magic
This is fantastic, and we could get some practice
And miles on our passes for love

Would you believe we're alone
So far from home, but you'd never go
Said you're so free, in the zone
Ain't got no phone, don't need it though

Cause it ain't got no waves (waves)
Waves (waves)
Waves (waves)
Waves (waves)
And just wave (wave)
Wave (wave)
Wave (wave)

Now the other way...
(Uh, okay)

Let's do some more writing
I got a couple fish then we can dine
Look, we're getting better
Aging like your favorite wine

I got rose-colored glasses
Batten your eyelashes
Come on, don't be passive
So last time will be magic
This is fantastic, and we could get some practice
And miles on our passes for love

Would you believe we're alone
So far from home, but you'd never go
Said you're so free, in the zone
Ain't got no phone, don't need it though

I swear that you (yeah, we're goin')
Summer's time, my favorite pursuit (yeah, we're goin')
Bring your ring of shades, no need for shoes (yeah, we're goin')
All I need is your skin and the air
I swear to you (go babe, go babe)
Summer's time, my favorite pursuit (let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)

// Supplies //

Ain't no need of stopping, girl
There ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, okay

Met you out on Broadway
On the hottest night in town
We arrived solo
But we were being chased around
Saw you being caught up by some guy you used to know
Stepped in between the both of ya'll
Said "I'm leaving, do you wanna go?"

'Cause
I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit's 'bout to go down
I'll be the one with the level head
The world can end now
Baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies

I don't know if you remember this
But I was out of town
Flew in on a 3AM just to show up and hear your sounds
The multiple times, stop
Hit the set
You ain't headed that way
I can guarantee you that

I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit's about to go down
I'll be the one with the level head
The world can end now
Baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies

Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Can't nobody top it, girl
Ain't no better option, girl (okay)
Ain't nobody stopping, girl
This here when I drop in, girl
I work, work when I clock in, girl (okay)

I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit's about to go down
I'll be the one with the level head
The world can end now
Baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

Now I wanna know everything
Don't leave a single detail out
I'll get my lighter, just fell out
It makes me a generous lover
Oh, I wanna see everything
So don't leave a single detail out
I want it all on the table
The personal way to
Wait

Ain't no need of stopping, girl
There ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, okay

'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies

// Morning Light //

[Justin Timberlake:]
Look
Every time there's a new sunrise
I open up my eyes
And I say to myself, "In the whole wide world of guys
I must be the luckiest alive"

'Cause I'm in love with you
Laying here, in a morning light
And all I wanna do
Is hold you tight, just one more night

[Alicia Keys:]
Look, I can't even get out of bed
With the thought you putting in my head
So I say to myself, "I don't even wanna try"
Here, every part of me is paralyzed

[Alicia Keys & Justin Timberlake:]
'Cause I'm in love with you
Laying here in the morning light
And all I wanna do
Is hold you tight just one more night
Yes, I'm in love with you
Laying here in a morning light
And all I wanna do
Is hold you tight, just one more night

[Justin Timberlake:]
I know I got somewhere to go
But I'm thinking we should lay here in love (lay here in love)
Ooh, 'cause baby, it's not lie
Ooh, I could watch you 'till the day I die

[Justin Timberlake & Alicia Keys:]
'Cause I'm in love with you
Laying here in the morning light
And all I wanna do
Is hold you tight just one more night
Yes, I'm in love with you
Laying here in a morning light
And all I wanna do
Is hold you tight, just one more, one more night

// Say Something //

[Justin Timberlake:]
Ooh
Yeah, alright
Ooh

Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere
I wanna go there, still I don't go there

Everybody says, "say something that says something"
"Say something that says something", say something that says something
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it

But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Justin Timberlake (Chris Stapleton):]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have

[Chris Stapleton:]
Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere
There's melody and harmony
For you and me, tonight
Whoa, I hear them call my name

Everybody says, "say something that says something"
"Say something that says something", say something that says something
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it

But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Justin Timberlake (Chris Stapleton):]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)

[Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton:]
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing

But I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it

[Justin Timberlake (Chris Stapleton):]
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
(Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have)

[Justin Timberlake & Chris Stapleton:]
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing

// Hers (Interlude) //

When I wear his shirt, it feels like, like his skin over mine
And the little holes and tears and shreds on in are, are, are the, the memories of the past that I wasn't there for, but, that somehow I, I feel like I understand more when it's against my skin
It's an armor, like a barrier from the world
Like, our secret nobody else knows and I like that, you know?
It makes me feel like a woman, it makes me feel sexy, it makes me feel... it makes me feel like I'm his...

// Flannel //

Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm

When a father's love is doin' you wrong
When a mother's love is bringin' you home
When you needed, needed, needed, needed a stone
Someone to lean on
Now I know I could never sit in his chair
And that missin' love left you bare, yeah
But if I'm bein' selfish, that gave me a reason to be there
With my flannel on

Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm

You see, I've been down that road before
And I wouldn't dare say that my hurt was more
But a little spitfire hurt you, boy
With nothin' to lean on (nothin' to lean on)
It's bound to go down after a couple empty cans
And I knew once I saw that fancy record company man
And in her face, she knew I was a stan
I was leavin' with my flannel on

Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm
The character's in the way you wear it
It takes your shape while you keep it on
May we live for many winters
Keepin' each other warm

Now I pledge you'll never ever be alone again
And I pledge these arms and chest are here to hold you in from the cold

Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm
Ooh, here's my flannel
The character's in the way you wear it (the way you wear it)
It takes your shape while you keep it on (all you gotta do is keep it on)
May we live for many winters
Keepin' each other warm
And may we live for many winters
Keepin' each other warm

(Do you see?
Look at all of it from up here
It's beautiful, it's beautiful
Do you see it?
It's in the air
It's in your blood
It's in your skin
Can you see it from up here?
Can you taste it?
Can you touch it?
It's in the earth
It's in the sky
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
Do you see me?)

// Montana //

Couldn't get any better, huh
You and I here together, huh
Love kicked in and hit us, huh
Let your body tingle, uh

Take a light, do you like that?
'Cause it likes you back (likes you back, likes you back, likes you back)
Take a light, do you like that?
'Cause it likes you back (likes you back, likes you back, likes you back)

Everything is heightened
We're feelin' vulnerable
I'm makin' you this vow
That you can have it all
Take whatever you want, take whatever you want

Don't wanna leave, girl, without you
And I can't sleep, no, I wouldn't know how to
When I need a compass, yeah, yeah
You're the one that I come get
And you tell me go wherever you want, go wherever you wanna

Couldn't get any better, huh
You and I here together, huh
Love kicked in and hit us, huh
Let your body tingle, uh

And now my circle of friends got tighter
I don't have time no more
Look, I'm only fuckin' with you, for real
And baby, you can have it all
Take whatever you want, take whatever you want

Don't wanna leave, girl, without you
And I can't sleep, no, I wouldn't know how to
When I need a compass, yeah, yeah
You're the one that I come get
And you tell me go wherever you want, go wherever you wanna

Couldn't get any better, huh
You and I here together, huh
Love kicked in and hit us, huh
Let your body tingle, uh

Now I know it's 8 o'clock
And we've been kissin' for hours
When the moon wakes up the sun
And our shadows kissed up on the mountains
Our kiss is somethin' to watch
Yes I know it's 8 o'clock, oh
And we've been kissin' for hours
But when the moon wakes up the sun
And our shadows kissed up on the mountains
Our kiss is somethin' to watch

Couldn't get any better, huh
You and I here together, huh
Love kicked in and hit us, huh
Let your body tingle, uh

Take a light, do you like that?
'Cause it likes you back (likes you back, likes you back, likes you back)
Take a light, do you like that?
'Cause it likes you back (likes you back, likes you back, likes you back)

Back to you, ooh Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Back to you, ooh Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana
Take me back to you, ooh, Montana

// Breeze Off The Pond //

Like breeze off the pond
Or trees on the lawn
Wind is always there, they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you

Grass is greenest when you're here with me, okay
If what they got is all good then why would they trade
No we are in the zone and we ain't gonna let it go, no way
(No we ain't gonna let it go, gonna let it go, no)
What we got is solid as oak so you know it'll never blow away

Like breeze off the pond
Or trees on the lawn
Wind is always there, they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you

Now the sun dances across the sparkly waves, yeah
While we're canoeing, stoned as "Tiny Dancer" plays
Huff and puff all they want, but this house isn't made of straw
What we got is solid as oak, so you know it'll never blow away

Like breeze off the pond
Or trees on the lawn
Wind is always there, they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you
Like breeze off the pond
Or trees on the lawn
Wind is always there, they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you

You and I against the world, against the world, against the world
You and I against the world, and everything that comes with
No denying what you're worth, what you're worth, what you're worth
I'd be foolish beyond words to lose you

What I'd look like trying to hide my life
One of those guys, I was taught you should keep it low
Nuh-uh, want a billboard space with a big ol' sign
You could see it from the highway
What I'd look like trying to hide my life
One of those guys, I was taught you should keep it low
Nuh-uh, want a billboard space with a big ol' sign
You could see it from the highway, uh

// Livin' Off The Land //

You have to be comfortable with yourself because that's all there is
You and nature
You think you got it all figured out, you know, the wilderness will figure some way to teach you a lesson
As I'm alone in the forest I'm in one with my surroundings and there's a lot of peace in that solitude
I obey my command...

(Living off the land...)

And I break my back
And I work all night
At times I do all their work too
It don't break my stride
I just keep moving forward
At times I wish there were two
So I have somebody else
That could help me help you

I'll be down, sometimes it's hard
To back up the bills on the credit card
She keeps on running to leave
If you don't get on your knees
And repay the money you spend
But like her trust, you cannot get lit
Sunday, you go to church
Back on your knees and you're tryna soul search

Singing I'm just one man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land

Why you waste what you ain't got
On that power box
Has it not quite dawned on you
That don't work at all
See the easy thing to do
Is the hardest thing to do
You just open up yourself
So the truth could come through

I'll be down, sometimes it's hard
To back up the bills on the credit card
She keeps on running to leave
If you don't get on your knees
And repay the money you spend
But like her trust, you cannot get lit
Sunday, you go to church
Back on your knees and you're tryna soul search

Singing I'm just one man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land
Living off the land
Living off the land
Living off the land

I'll be down, sometimes it's hard
To back up the bills on the credit card
She keeps on running to leave
If you don't get on your knees
And repay the money you spend
But like her trust, you cannot get lit
Sunday, you go to church
Back on your knees and you're tryna soul search

Singing I'm just one man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land
Living off the land
Living off the land

I'm just one man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land

If you just open up yourself (if you just open up yourself)
If you just open up yourself (if you just open up yourself)
If you just open up yourself, you'll see, that what you need
When you're living off the land

// The Hard Stuff //

So give me the hard stuff (hard stuff)
Ooh, yeah

Anybody can be in love on a sunny day
Anybody can turn and run when it starts to rain
And everybody wishes all the skies were blue
But that ain't the kind of love I'm lookin' to have with you

So give me the hard stuff
The kind that makes you real
I'll be there when the storm comes
'Cause I want the hard stuff
When they're throwin' sticks and stones
We can cut each other to the bone
I'm never gonna give you up
'Cause I want the hard stuff (hard stuff)
Yeah, I want the hard stuff (hard stuff, yeah)

My god knows I'm not the man that I want to be
And we all know there's things in this life we refuse to see
So just know my fire for you will always burn
And please forgive the things in this life that I have to learn

So give me the hard stuff
The kind that makes you real
I wanna be there when the storm comes
'Cause I want the hard stuff
When they're throwin' sticks and stones
We can cut each other to the bone
I'm never gonna give you up
'Cause I want the hard stuff (hard stuff)

No, we won't have to wonder
Oh, you won't have to wonder
If we're ever goin' under
No, we're never goin' under
No, we're never goin' under

'Cause I want the hard stuff
The kind that makes you real
I wanna be there when the storm comes
'Cause I want the hard stuff (I want the hard stuff)
When they're throwin' sticks and stones
Cut each other to the bone (break each other to the bone)
I'm never gonna give you up
'Cause I want the hard stuff (hard stuff, oh)
Yeah, I want the hard stuff (I want the hard stuff, yeah)

Yeah, I want the hard stuff
(Give me the hard stuff)
Give me the hard stuff
Yeah, I want the... I want the hard stuff
So give me the hard stuff

Beautiful boy, got it from your momma
Damn, she look good, you might get a sister

You can do anything in the world if you listen

We don't ever back down, don't back down
We don't have to act out, don't act out
And even when you fall, don't stay down
If you need me around, you know I stay down
And anywhere you go, you can go your own way
If you ask me how I know these things, remember I once was a

Young man
Sit down, let me tell you how it's s'posed to be

But you gon' have to stand for something

Someday somebody's gonna break your heart in two
And I'll be there
Someday you're gonna break somebody's heart
That's what we do
One day I'll be gone, son, but right now I'm home
No, you'll never be alone
Maybe someday you'll be talking to your own
