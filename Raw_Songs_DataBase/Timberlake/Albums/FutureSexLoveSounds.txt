Album: FutureSexLoveSounds

// FutureSex / LoveSound //

Future sex love sound
Yeah.

You know what you want
And that makes you just like me
See everybody says you're hot, baby
But can you make it hot for me?
Said if you're thinking 'bout holding back
Don't worry, girl
'Cause I'm gonna make it so easy
So slide a little bit closer to me, little girl
Daddy's on a mission to please

Wait a second
She's hopped up on me
I've got her in my zone
Her body's pressed up on me
I think she's ready to blow
Must be my future sex love sound
And when it goes down
Baby all you gotta do is...

Just tell me which way you like that
All you gotta do is
Tell me which way you like that
Do you like it like this?
Do you like it like that?
Tell me which way you like that
Tell me which way you like that

You can't stop, baby
You can't stop once you've turned me on
And your enemy are your thoughts, baby
So just let 'em go
'Cause all I need is a moment alone
To give you my tongue
And put you out of control
And after you let it in
We'll be skin to skin
It's just so natural

Wait a second
She's hopped up on me
I've got her in my zone
Her body's pressed up on me
I think she's ready to blow
Must be my future sex love sound
And when it goes down
Baby all you gotta do is...

Just tell me which way you like that.
All you gotta do is
Tell me which way you like that
Do you like it like this?
Do you like it like that?
Tell me which way you like that
Tell me which way you like that

Future sex love sound

Wait a second
She's hopped up on me

Her body's pressed up on me
I think she's ready to blow
Must be my future sex love sound
And when it goes down
Baby all you gotta do is...

Just tell me which way you like that.
All you gotta do is
Tell me which way you like that
Do you like it like that?
Tell me which way you like that
Tell me which way you like that

// Sexy Ladies / Let Me Talk To You Prelude //

I can tell you want to go girl
You ain't gotta worry no more
You keep my bottles cold and you pop 'em
As soon as I walk in the door
These dude don't know me from Adam and Eve
That's why they can't mess up my flow
And when this beat drops, your heart stops
You feel it from your head to your toes

If you know what I'm talking 'bout
Let me see you work it out
Girl that's what I'm talking 'bout

I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talking to one of the greatest
Who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest
Just letting you know
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more
Let me take it off

I know a little girly from uptown
Just waiting just to cater to me
I know a little betty from downtown
That'll do anything that I please
All my other people that dance around
When they hear me rocking the groove
Now it might sound cocky
But is it really cocky if you know that it's true

If you know what I'm talking 'bout
Let me see you work it out
Girl that's what I'm talking 'bout

I got sexy ladies all over the floor
You're talking to one of the greatest
Who did it before
Now I'm back with one of my latest
Just letting you know
That I got sexy ladies so back up some more
And let me take it off

Walk that body, talk that body
Sexy, sexy, sexy

Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body
Sexy, sexy, sexy
Walk that body, talk that body

Now move a little bit to the left
Now move back over here to the right
Now let me see you walk, walk, yeah
Let me see you walk
Here comes your part girl

// My Love //

Ain't another woman that can take your spot my-

If I wrote you a symphony,
Just to say how much you mean to me
What would you do?
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular
Tell me, would you?

Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl
Like you
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you
Saying "I do"

Yeah, because I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

Girl
My love
My love

Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote
What would you do?
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team
Tell me, would you?

See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl I've never been more sure
That baby, it's you
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for
Just saying "I do"

Yeah, because I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
(So don't give away) My love
(So don't give away) My love

Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

Girl

My love

[T.I.:]
Alright it's time to get it JT
I don't know what she hesitates for man
Shorty, cool as a fan
On the new once again
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls real wild
Throw their hands up high
When you wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And with friends so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I.
They call me Candle Guy (why?)
Simply 'cause I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try
You don't come, I ain't gon' die

Hold up, what you mean, you can't go? Why?
Me and your boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high? Man
Well, baby it's obvious that I ain't your guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
And forget your face, I swear I will
St. Barths, Anguilla anywhere I chill
Just bring with me any pair, I will

I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby, let me make you my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love

(Love) My love
(Love) My love
(Love) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
(Love) My love
(Love) My love
(Love) Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love

// Lovestoned / I Think She Knows Interlude //

She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky and I like it

Listen

She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight

She looks like a model
Except she's got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

[Chorus 1:]
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man I swear she's bad and she knows
I think that she knows

She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it

She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2:]
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's bad and she knows
I think that she knows

Now dance
Get it girl
You're freaky, but I like it
Hot damn!
Let me put my funk on this one time

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[instrumental break]

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
I think I'm love stoned
She's got me love stoned

I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh [repeat 2 more times]

Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her I just stop and stare
I'm love stoned from everywhere and she knows
I think that she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh

And now I walk around without a care
She's got me hooked
It just ain't fair, but I...
I'm love stoned and I could swear
That she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh
She knows, she knows, oh, oh

// What Goes Around... / ...Comes Around Interlude //

Hey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you babe
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong

Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Tell me is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find...

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

Now girl, I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now
And maybe I should do the same
Funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, babe
And now, it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong

Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Can you tell me is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around (should've known better that you were gonna make me cry)
That you were going to make me cry
Now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

What goes around comes around
Yeah
What goes around comes around
You should know that
What goes around comes around
Yeah
What goes around comes around
You should know that

Don't want to think about it (no)
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it (yeah)
I just can't do without ya
Tell me is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around (should've known better that you were gonna make me cry)
That you were going to make me cry
Now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's okay baby 'cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around

[Comes Around interlude:]

Let me paint this picture for you, baby

You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes

When you cheated girl
My heart bleeded girl
So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt
Just a classic case
A scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl you got what you deserved

And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody
That could come and make it right

But girl I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy
You'll see

(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey
(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey

[laughs]
See?
You should've listened to me, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Because
(What goes around comes back around)
[laughs]

// Chop Me Up //

Tennesse

Dirty south
Dirty south
It's how we do what we do, man, when we do what we do

[Justin:]
I know you see me looking, girl go on and act right
A little closer, let me see you in the spotlight
Now turn around and let me see just what ya curved like
Go grab your friends and y'all can come to the back, oh-oh

Why don't you take a sip upon this champagne
Relax, take your coat off, and let me get your name
I love that hour-glass shape you got upon that frame
I like the way you talk your game we might be one and the same

Now I know you got a buzz off that alcohol
I got a house that can entertain all of y'all
Maybe later on I'll give you a phone call
I'm 'bout to slide out, but I'll get back at ya, oh-oh

And when I call don't give me the run-around
I ain't gonna have you tryin' to play me like a silly clown
Don't second guess it, girl
There ain't nothin' to think about
'Cause you got me feigning, but girl you don't hear me

Little lady
You got me just
(screwed up)
Off of your melody
Little lady
C'mon and don't
(chop me up)
Please don't make a fool of me

Little lady
You got me just
(screwed up)
Off of your melody
Easy baby
C'mon girl don't
(chop me up)
Please don't make a fool of me

[Timbaland:]
You're kinda cute
Baby, are you new in town?
My name is Tim
Aka Thomas Crown
I heard you're lost
Do you know your way around
If you gotta problem baby I can hold ya down

I can be your navigator
or your compass
Better yet a genie baby make your first wish
You the party, baby
I'm just the guestlist
I think I need some Tylenol
You got me restless

So grab your friends
And let's take it back to my house
Let's watch Sex and the City or Desperate Housewives
Simon says touch yours while you touch mine
(parental discretion is advised)
Oh-oh

Y'all can be the star in my spotlight
Studio 54 if we get the props right
All we need right now is a little bit, a little bit of act right
Y'all looking shy, but ya act like y'all don't hear me

Little lady
You got me just
(screwed up)
Off of your melody
Little lady
C'mon and don't

Please don't make a fool of me

Little lady
You got me just

Off of your melody
Easy baby
C'mon girl don't
(chop me up)
Please don't make a fool of me

[Three 6 Mafia:]
See girl you stronger than the strongest drug I ever had
You could mix 'em all together you still be twice as bad
'Cause you the worst best girlfriend I ever had
Harder to kick than cigarettes and green bags
Harder to escape than jail cells and bills
You had me lost since the Philly girl with Pigtails.
Like Michael Jackson, "how you do me this way?"
Got me cryin' rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake, yeah

They call me Juicy J straight up out the Three 6 Mafia
Ghetto fab player on these streets I'm tryin' a holla at ya
Quit playing games girl you got my head spinnin' 'round
I ain't gonna chirp your mobile phone and chase you all over town
I just want to pick you up and take you to a wrestling match
Is it good? Is it good?
And have a little smack fest
So if you never call me I'll be somewhere down in Tennessee
Washing away my sorrows in a cold cup of Hennessy

Little lady
You got me just
(screwed up)
Off of your melody
Little lady
C'mon and don't
(chop me up)
Please don't make a fool of me

Little lady
You got me just
(screwed up)
Off of your melody
Easy baby
C'mon girl don't
(chop me up)
Please don't make a fool of me

Screwed up

Screwed up
Off of your melody
Chop me up
Please don't make a fool of me

Ridin' in the drop top with the top down

Pull up to the red light, lookin' right
Come here, let me get your name girl
Tell me where you from, what you do, what you like
Let me pick your brain girl
And tell me how they got that pretty little face on that pretty little frame girl
But let me show you 'round, let me take you out
Bet you we could have some fun girl
'Cause we can do it fast (fast), slow, whichever way you wanna run girl
But let me buy you drinks, better yet rings
Do it how you want it done girl
And who would've thought that you could be the one 'cause I

I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

Come on and lemme show you 'round
Let me take you out, bet you we could have some fun girl
'Cause we can dress it up, we can dress it down
Any way you want it done girl
Or we can stay home, talkin' on the phone
Rappin' 'til we see the sun girl
Do what I gotta do, just gotta show you that I'm the one girl
Well I'mma freak you right, each and every night
I know how to do it insane girl
'Cause I can make it hot, make it stop
Make you wanna say my name girl
Come on baby please 'cause I'm on my knees
Can't get you off my brain girl
But who would've thought that you could be the one 'cause I

I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)
'Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

The summer's over for the both of us
But that doesn't mean we should give up on love
You're the one I've been thinking of
And I knew the day I met you you'd be the one

I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)
'Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

[Set the Mood Prelude]

Let me set the mood right
'Cause I'm gonna make you feel alright
Let me set the mood right
'Cause I'm gonna make you feel alright

Gotta set the mood right
And that may make you feel alright
I'm gonna set the mood right
I promise baby you'll feel alright

Just let me set the mood right
And that may make you feel alright
I'm gonna set the mood right
And you will say my name tonight
If I set the mood right
Promise girl you'll feel alright
If you let me set the mood right
I'll make you feel so good tonight

If it feels good to you then it'll feel good to me
Let me set the mood right

// Until The End Of Time //

Listen

I woke up this morning
Heard the TV sayin' something
'Bout disaster in the world and
It made me wonder where I'm going

There's so much darkness in the world
But I see beauty left in you girl
And what you give me lets me know
That I'll be alright

'Cause if your love was all I had
In this life
Well that would be enough
Until the end of time
So rest your weary heart
And relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you girl
Until the end of time

You've got me singing
Everybody sing
Everybody singing

Now if you're ever wondering
About the way I'm feeling
Well baby girl there ain't no question
Just to be around you is a blessing

Sick and tired of tryna save the world
I just want to spend my time with you girl
And what you're giving me lets me know
That we'll be alright

'Cause if your love was all I had
In this life
Well that would be enough
Until the end of time
So rest your weary heart
And relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you girl
Until the end of time

You've got me singing
Everybody sing
Everybody singing

This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
Break it down one time

'Cause if your love was all I had
In this life
That would be enough
Until the end of time

// Losing My Way //

Yeah... Hum... Yeah... Uh... Excuse me

Hi my name is Bob and I work at my job
I make forty-something dollars a day
I used to be the man in my hometown
Until I started to lose my way
It all goes back to when I dropped out at school
Having fun, I was living the life
But now I got a problem with that little white rock
See I can't put down the pipe

And...

It is breaking me down
Watching the world spin round
While my dreams fall down
Is anybody out there?

It is breaking me down
No more friends around...
And my dreams fall down...
Is anybody out there?

Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself...
There's gotta be a heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself

Losing my way
Keep losing my way...
Keep losing my way...
Can you help me find my way?
Losing my way
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way...
Can you help me find my way?

Now you gotta understand I was a family man
I would have done anything for my own
But I couldn't get a grip on my new found itch
So I ended up all alone
I remember where I was when I got my first buzz
See I thought I was living the life
And the craziest thing is I'll probably never know the color of my daughter's eyes

And it is breaking me down
Watching the world spin round
While my dreams fall down
Is anybody out there?

It is breaking me down
No more friends around...
And my dreams fall down...
Is anybody out there?

Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself.

Losing my way
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help find my way?
Losing my way
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?

Oh my God please forgive me (Father hear my prayer)
'Cause I know I've done some wrong in this life
If I could do it all again
Have just one more chance
To take all those wrongs and make them right

Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself.

Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself

Losing my way
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?
Losing my way
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?

// (Another Song) All Over Again //

You've been alone, you've been afraid
I've been a fool
In so many ways
but I would change my life
If you thought you, might try to love me
So please give me another chance
To write you another song
And take back those things I've done
Cause I'll give you my heart
If you would let me start all over,
Again

I'm not a saint
I'm just a man
Who had heaven and Earth
In the palm of his hand
but I threw it away
So now I stand here today asking forgiveness and if you could just please
Give me another chance
to write you another song
And take back those thing's I've done
Cause I'll give you my heart
If you would let me start all over
Again

Little girl you're all I've got.
Don't you leave me standing here once again?
'Cause I'll give you my life
Yes I would.
If you would let me try to love you

So please give me another chance to write you another song and take back those thing's I've done

'Cause I'll give you my heart
If you would let me start all over
Again

Again, oh,no no ohh

You know I love you, yeah
give me one more chance
No no, no no no no
