// Better Days //

There's a light at the end of the tunnel
Keep your eyes on the road ahead
But if you're feeling lost in the night
It's okay to cry
Just as long as you hold your head

'Cause we're on our way to better
Better's ahead, better's ahead
It get's worse 'fore it gets better
But better's ahead, better's ahead
Better days are comin' (Better and better and better, ooh-ooh)
Better days are comin' (Ooh-ooh, better days)
Better days, better days (Better and better and better, oh-ooh)
Better days are comin' (Better days, better days)

I know you've been kicked down
Slept on, let down, faith gone
Waited for too long for something to lean on (Lean on)
You feel weak, just be strong (Ooh)
Deep breath, stay calm
If you just press on, press on, press on

You gon' see there's a light at the end of the tunnel (At the end of the tunnel)
Keep your eyes on the road ahead (On the road ahead)
And if you're feelin' lost in the night (Lost in the night)
It's okay to cry (It's okay to cry)
Just as long as you hold your head

'Cause we're on our way to better (Aah)
Better's ahead, (Better) better's ahead (Aah)
It get's worse 'fore it gets better (Ah-ah-ah)
But better's ahead, better's ahead
Better days are comin' (Better and better and better, ooh-ooh, I know, I know)
Better days are comin' (Ooh-ooh)
(Better days, better days) (Better and better and better, ooh-ooh)
Better days are comin' (Ooh-ooh)
(Better days, better days)

I know you feel left out and stepped on
Keep goin', keep goin'
Shine bright, don't dim yours for no one
Keep goin' higher, and higher and higher and higher

(Because there's better)
Better days, better days are comin' (Better days)
Better days, better days (On their way) are comin' ('Cause I know)
Better days, better days (Better days) are comin' (Yeah)
Better days, (Oh) better days are comin' (I know)
Better days are comin'

// Better Not Together //

Uuuhh Uuuhh Uuhmm
Love is lost, where is it to be found?
My heart is still here
Do we have to go round and round?
And all the time I was loving you faithfully
And you took my love, and you turned it around on me

Now I don't wanna fight with you
I've done everything I can do
Don't you leave me like that
I just want my girl back
Can we work it out?, or was it over ?

What are we doing? [x2]
Why can't we seem to work things out?
What are we doing? [x2]
Did we forget what love was about?
Feels like I'm losing [x2]
But when that was everything to me
But now I realize
We are just better not together

It's hard to let go
Girl we've been through so many things
But for you to grow
You have to go and spread your wings
I see your tears
You are searching for a brighter day
And you should have thought it through
When you gave my love away

Now I don't wanna fight with you
I've done everything I can do
I hate to leave you like that
But I thought you had my back
We tried to work it out, but it's over

What are we doing? [x2]
Why cant we seem to work things out? (Was you and me together)
What are we doing [x2]
Did we forget what love was about?
Feels like I'm losing [x2]
But when that was everything to me
But now I realize
We are just better not together

Girl it's just too much for me to say
You to tell me that you love me
And then to watch you walk away
But girl the way we fight
It just ain't right
That's why it's better this way (Yeah yeah yeah)
Now no what else to say
But girl you know that
I still love you
yeahhhhh

What are we doing?
Why cant we seem to work things out?
What are we doing? [x2]
Did we forget what love was about? (Come on baby)
Feels like I'm losing [x2]
But that was everything for me
But now I realize
We are just better not together

I've realized
We are just better
Not together

// Can't Stop The Feeling! //

I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavy when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we're in our zone

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it
Moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it
So don't stop

And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

Nothing I can see but you
When you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance
Come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon
So keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
Come on

Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
Don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it
Moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it
So don't stop

And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

Nothing I can see but you
When you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance
Come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon
So keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So keep dancing, come on

I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric wavy when I turn it on
And if you want it inside your soul
Just open up your heart, let music take control

I got that sunshine in my pocket

I can't take my eyes up off it
Moving so phenomenally

Your smile make my day it's simple, your dimple 
Your eyes, your lips, your thighs got me hypnotized 
Communication is deep, I love it when we talk
Hate it when you leave but when you leave I love to watch you walk 
You make a nigga forget about a life full of DRAMA
She got expensive taste she get it from her momma 
Materialistic still a nigga wanna consistantly miss her
Touch what she don't, she smell like CHANEL 
She feelin me and I can tell
With the right woman by my side I feel like I can't fail 
I been around been up my attitude if fuck it now, she a rider 
I'm in heaven when I am inside her 
Workin up a sweat, kissin on her neck 
Twirl play in the deck four bit correct 
Have her drippin wet
She look in my eye and said she like but I know she love it
I just keep doin what I'm doin and think nothing of it

// Don't Slack //

Not anyone can move you this way (No way)
Finally gotcha loose from the cage (Ok)
I ain't tryna smooze with flowers, baby (No playin' no games)
I'd rather make a power play (No playin' no games)
Imagine all the lives that we can change
You don't even know the power you got in them legs
Pick up your face and be proud for once (Proud for once)
Take off your cool, but keep stylin' on 'em (Keep stylin' on 'em)

Ok, now don't slack

No, we don't hold back
Act like you know that

Go get your whole fam'
Fly like the ghost man
Taking all I can

I just came to feel all that is made for me
I was made to be the change we really, really, need

I'm up before the rooster, ya dig? (Ooh, you dig?)
I had to jump the moon to get big (Ooh, to get big)
How many stone grooves will it take? (Ok)
For you to skip on my funk lake (Oh, oh, ok)
Imagine all the lives that we can save
You don't even know the power you got in them legs
Pick up your face and be proud for once (Proud for once)
Go quit ya gig and get down with us (Keep stylin' on 'em)

Ok, now don't slack
I need all my racks
No, we don't hold back
Act like you know that

Go get your whole fam'
Fly like the ghost man

And I drive in the cold rain
And I run like a nose bleed
And can't nobody hold me hold me hold me hold me hold me hold me hold me

Ok, now don't slack

Away from home, away from home,
Away from home, away from home

If you missed the train I'm on
You will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

A hundred miles, a hundred miles
A hundred miles, a hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

// Hair Up //

Hair in the air
Put your hair
Put your hair in the air

Hair in the air
Put your hair
Put your hair in the air
I've got a fever coming on
And now it's beating on my bones
I feel like diamonds or some gold
So DJ play it
That's my song

Go, go, go, go, go
Put your hair in the air
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Hair up

Come on baby
Let's go crazy
We ain't never gonna stop
Hair up
Come on baby
Let's go crazy
We ain't never gonna stop
Hair up

Put your hair in the air (hair up)
We don't care (hair up)
Put your hair in the air (hair up)
We don't care (hair up)

I've got a fever coming on
And now it's beating on my bones
I feel like diamonds or some gold
So DJ play it

Go, go, go, go, go
Put your hair in the air
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Hair up

Come on baby
Let's go crazy
We ain't never gonna stop
Hair up
Come on baby
Let's go crazy
We ain't never gonna stop

// Hallelujah //

Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you
To her kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah 
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

// I'm Lovin' It //

I'm lovin' it
I'm lovin' it
I'm lovin' it
Don't you love it too?

Yo
Hi, I'm not here to waste your time
You know this ain't a pick up line
I just think that you're a dime
Well don't just sit there girl

Well I know that heart that's in your chest
It carries pain and so much stress
But you got to let it go
(Go, go, girl)
Just close your eyes I'll grab your waist
Next think you know you have your pace
Girl you got to let it go
(Go, go, girl)

I know that you wanna get down
You do deserve to get down
Been working hard all week
Just trying to make your money
Girl go on and shake your booty
I'm lovin' it, I'm lovin' it

I'm lovin' it
I'm lovin' it

By the way what's your sign
I bet it is compatible with mine
Probably long lasting years down the line
I'm telling you girl you're a dime
Well don't just sit there girl

I know that heart that's in your chest
It carries pain and so much stress
But you got to let it go
(Go, go, girl)
(Just let go)
Just close your eyes I'll grab your waist
Next think you know you have your pace
Girl you got to let it go
(Go, go, girl)

Oh...
(Remember)
Oh...
(The first time we met)
Oh...
(Butterflies in your stomach)
Oh...
(Couldn't speak)
Oh...
(You)
Oh...
(Close your eyes)
Oh...
(It's ok)
Oh...
(I was lovin' it)
Oh...

How, how you do all the things you do?
(How you do it?)
Like being you, you're so professional
(Professional)
Not to mention you're the baddest of your group
Well don't just sit there girl

I know that you wanna get down
You do deserve to get down
(Wanna get down)
Been working hard all week
(Oh, yea)
Just trying to make your money
(Money)
Girl go on and shake your booty

// Love Don't Love Me //

5 foot 9
She's got legs for days (For days)
Green eyes that cut like a knife
And her own little sexy sway
No, she don't waste no time
Moving to the floor (To the floor)
And when she starts to move
She have you calling your mama saying "You wanna go home"

Baby, tell me
Why can't I have you?
Why you running girl?
I just wanted to love you

I love you, baby

But I guess love don't love me, no

It's OK to be scared
'Cause this girl is super bad (Yeah, yeah)
She will probably be the best thing that you never had
(The best thing that you never had)
Don't waste no time (Waste your time)
Trying to make her your own (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause what she says goes
And like Boyz II Men said, this is the end of the road

Baby, tell me (Tell me)
Why can't I have you? (Why can't I have you?)
Why you running, girl? (Why you running, girl?)
I just wanted to love you

But I guess you don't have time for me
(Don't have the time for me, yeah)
I want you, baby

But I guess love don't love me, no

Baby, you said you loved me (You said you loved me)
But you led me on
Left me feeling strong (Feeling so strong about...)
About you
But I can't take no more, so I'm gonna leave you alone
Girl, I'm gone; girl, I'm gone, OH!

What's it gonna take to get you to love me, baby?
'Cause I can't take it anymore (Take it no more!)
You're gonna be mine for sure, ya know (Hey, hey, yeah)
What's it gonna take to get you to love me, baby?
(Baby, what's it gonna take?)
'Cause I can't take it anymore
(Can't take it no more!)
You're gonna be mine for sure, ya know

I love you, baby
I love you (Love you)
I love you, baby
I love you (Said I love you)
But I guess you don't have time for me
(Guess you ain't interested in me, yeah)
I want you, baby

But I guess love don't love me, no

I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me

(You know what?! Screw you!)
But I guess love don't love me

// Perfect For Me //

I know your favorite song
I hear it everyday
Whoever made your smile
Made it to get in my way
And every time you laugh
You make that little sound
It's just the hardest thing
To love you but not know how

So I spend all my nights in the dark and afraid
'Cause I've tried to forget you but these things just don't go away

I hate that you're perfect, perfect for me
If I didn't know better then I would believe
We were made for each other
But I'd know the truth
You're no good for me, I'm no good for you
And I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me
I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me

What good are words when they always just get in our way
And it hurts the most just to know that you don't feel the same, the same
So sometimes I get down on my knees and I pray things will change
But life is what happens when things they don't work out our way, our way

So I spend all my nights in the dark and afraid
'Cause I've tried to forget you but these things just don't go away, away

I hate that you're perfect, perfect for me
If I didn't know better then I would believe
We were made for each other
But I'd know the truth
You're no good for me, I'm no good for you
And I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me
I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me

// September //

[Justin Timberlake:]
Do you remember
The 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

[Anna Kendrick:]
Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away

[Earth, Wind & Fire:]
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

[Anna Kendrick:]
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

[Justin Timberlake:]
Now December found the love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember, the true love we share today

[Earth, Wind & Fire:]
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

And we say
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

[Justin Timberlake:]
The bell was ringing, aha
Our souls were singing
Do you remember
Never was a cloudy day

[Earth, Wind & Fire:]
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

[Justin Timberlake:]
Break it down for me (say do you remember)
Dancing in September

[Earth, Wind & Fire & Justin Timberlake:]
Ba de ya
Say do you remember
Do you remember?
Ba de ya - dancing in September (dancing in September)
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

Uh huh! (bring it back now)
Dancing in September
Uh huh!
All the way down to the summer

Summer starts now

I love your heartbeat givin' me rhythm
And I can feel your frequency, so unique
In other words, such a freak, set me free

I wanna be, wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be your...

Soulmate, for the night
Let me put my soul on you, it's only right

Two rhythms turn into one heartbeat, yeah
Magic when you get close to me

Make it disappear, that's too many clothes for me

I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be your...

Soulmate, for the night

// The Other Side //

[SZA:]
You're preachin' to the choir, stop hatin' on yourself
Quit playin' with your mind, you're spinnin'
If you think that I'm a liar, just try it for yourself
The clouds will open up, blue skies are willing
Yeah, I know it's so hard to throw away
The clouds will open up, blue skies are willing

[SZA & Justin Timberlake:]
Back on your feet again, lift your head, hold it high
You wanna run it back, but you can't turn the time
You start to feel like you're losing your shine
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
The other side
Got you stuck in your mind
You start to feel like you're losing your shine
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side

[Justin Timberlake:]
Hey you, stop stressin' 'bout what you're missin'
So blue, just take it easy, take your time
If you think my words are wise, just try it for yourself
I promise the stars will light the path you walk, don't give in

[SZA:]
Got a heart of gold, what a shame to go to waste
The clouds will open up, blue skies are willing

[SZA & Justin Timberlake (Justin Timberlake):]
Back on your feet again, lift your head, hold it high
You wanna run it back, but you can't turn the time
You start to feel like you're losing your shine (Losing your shine)
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side (Shine)
The other side (Feet again, lift your head, hold it high)
Got you stuck in your mind (Run it back, but you can't turn the time)
You start to feel like you're losing your shine
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side

[SZA (Justin Timberlake):]
Just take it from me, you'll be okay (You'll be okay)
'Cause it don't matter how sweet it tastes (How sweet it tastes)
The grass ain't green, don't worry
Losin' sleep, still wanna get
Yeah, you get

[SZA & Justin Timberlake:]
Back on your feet again, lift your head, hold it high
You wanna run it back, but you can't turn the time
You start to feel like you're losing your shine
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
You start to feel like you're losing your shine
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side

// TKO (Black Friday Remix) //

[Intro: Justin Timberlake (Timbaland)]
I don't understand it
Tell me, how could you be so low?
(And all in thrilling, new, living sound)
Dammit babe

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Blood thicker than water, right
Fuck bitches, they all alike
Stand up nigga, not the falling type
Heart blacker than a Harlem night
Til I met you, they say the devil wear Prada
But I doubt it cause the Lord did bless you
Damn look at that body
Short bus shorty, cause it sure is special
Cole to the rescue, never save a ho
Hoes like to hide their behavior though
Thought you was a down ass bitch
'til I found that shit a couple days ago
I was home alone, next thing I know
That long ass verse from a song called "Control" was on
The room got nearer, the tune got clearer
That's when I seen the shit playing on your phone
Girl, what is that, a ringtone
Shit, not you too
Man that hype done got you too
Everybody and their momma gassed
Even my momma asked what I'mma do
Decisions, decisions
In case this is war, then I load up on all ammunition
If a nigga want problems, my trigger's on auto
I'll make sure that nobody miss him
Now pack up your shit, you don't believe in me
I don't need you, I got me, bitch
Same nigga moved to NYC, bitch
Got a record deal and a college degree, bitch
Two gold plaques, I produced all the tracks
And I never ever ever lean on Jay-Z, bitch
And after all that achievement
Real nigga never even went and got his teeth fixed
Now you try to play me, bitch?
You try to fuckin' play me? I ought to knock your ass out

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
TKO, I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low
You've been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
All hail Pretty Flacko, bitch, celebrate it
Had the game on lock, streets serenaded
Now you lame mothafuckas lookin' devastated
Bet you niggas wish you never hated, that's the devil ain't it
Fuck that shit, he rich, fuck that shit, he this, fuck that shit, he that
He black, he don't like blacks, fuck that shit, he wack
Fuck that shit he raps, fuck that shit he spits, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch he with, finished talking shit
Get up off my dick
The nonsense is synonymous with comments from the blogs about
Menages with the gossips and the bosses, fuck surprises
I'm monogamous and not to mention, in my closet
Is a model chick, grimey gothic fits, trapped inside of it
Besides it I'd deny the shit, y'all should stop the shit
I'm the shit, not just kinda sick, the doc prescribed my shit
Cock it, click-click, opposite, stop and droppin' shit
'fore poppin' shit, from popular to poppin' picks to poppin' tits
She pop her pussy, pop a Xanny, popular for compliments
Make it rain, she pop that shit, it boosts her confidence
Was supposed to stop this shit but spit like I forgot some shit
Forgot the topic, I hope God forgive you, peep my common sense

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
JT this like deja vu right?
All this album of the year talk, niggas claiming they're the best out
I been hot since the Purple Tape and this cuban's poking my chest out
They keep calling on King Push, this beach chair, I'm stretched out
My name is my name, bitch, until I'm gone and it's etched out
I been known to blow a quarter brick on baby hairs and a messy bun
If I make her mine, I made her mind, she fall in line and we got some
Memoirs of a millionaire, even better I'm a reallionaire
Alaïa skirt, Fendi work, dress my baby like build-a-bear
Fuck you know about the type of rollie, fuck you know about blowin' bands
Bezel on it like a grand circle, diamonds in it, holdin' hands
A1 since day 1, I sold dope and my name rung
I sold dope where I came from and it's all dope what I made from it
No lie, know why? Guy Fish in my bowtie
JT up in the 3 piece and we magic baby like showtime
She ain't know, we ain't know, try to trap her but she ain't slow
Once she trap you with the DA flow, it's lights out, TKO

// Touch You If I Could //

No no...

Forever you told me
I'm the only who was in your heart
So beautiful how you whisper
We would never be apart
And now things are changing
I can see the way you look at me
They say that the eyes are the windows to the soul
So I finally chose the just in me
Why didn't I see you coming?

I'll miss the vision where you stood
And I would touch you if I could
But your lips keep sayin,
What your heart will never do
Someone tell me how can a girl as fine as you be so cold
And treat me like you do?
I'm still lost in your every move
It's just too bad that you're no good

(Just don't tell that you love me
I know that it's just not true)
No
(You gotta give it to me
Cuz you've got me...)
What the hell a man's to do?

Seduction at its finest
Has stripped away all of my dignity 
So beautiful
How you whisper
(Is there any good between you and me?)
No I never imagined myself
In this state of mind
I'm stuck between a dream and nightmare
Help cuz you've rendered me blind
Why didn't I see you coming?

I'll miss the vision where you stood
And I would touch you if I could
But your lips keep sayin,
What your heart will never do
Someone tell me how can a girl as fine as you be so cold
And treat me like you do?
I'm still lost in your every move
It's just too bad that you're no good

(Just don't tell that you love me
I know that it's just not true)
(You gotta give it to me
Cuz you've got me...)
What the hell a man's to do?

Why didn't I see you coming?

I'll miss the vision where you stood
And I would touch you if I could
But your lips keep sayin,
What your heart will never do
Someone tell me how can a girl as fine as you be so cold
And treat me like you do?
I'm still lost in your every move
It's just too bad that you're no good
[x2]

(Just don't tell that you love me
I know that it's just not true)
(You gotta give it to me
Cuz you've got me...)
What the hell a man's to do?

// Words I Say //

Sometimes I can't believe what I am seeing
But I always recive the love that you giving to me
And I still don't know what lead me to you
But I know this, this was meant to be
And girl in your smile I see my everything

[Chorus:]
But if the words I say
Make the tears roll down
And they find their way to where your heart pours out
Your lips can't say enough
Your tongue controls my love
And all that's I need is found
In the corners of your mouth

Tu tu tu tu...

Sometimes I can't believe the things I say to you
But baby every word of it's true, yes it is
And when you kiss me, it's all over
You put me under, I didn't know that love could hurt so good
And girl when you smile I see my everything

[Chorus:]
But if the words I say
Make the tears roll down
And they find their way to where your heart pours out
Your lips can't say enough
Your tongue controls my love
And all that's I need is found
In the corners of your mouth

[Bridge x2:]
Girl when I see you smile, you make my day worthwhile
Girl when you speak to me I can't feel myself breathe

[Chorus:]
But if the words I say
Make the tears roll down
And they find their way to where your heart pours out
Your lips can't say enough
Your tongue controls my love
And all that's I need is found
In the corners of your mouth

// You're My Light (Why, When, How?) //

Dum dum dum dum dum-dum
Do...
Do... Oooh...

You're still captivating even though it's been so long
You used to love me tell me baby what went wrong
'Cause now you march to the beat of a different song

Try to understand that we needed space
But everywhere I turn I see your face
I've been waiting for you to come home
'Cause I don't want to be alone
I still love you

Why did you take away your love
When did you think to just give up
How am I supposed to carry on now
Without you
You are my light

I have changed girl since I last saw you
When you left you don't know what you put me through
But my heart's still racing just being next to you

I can't escape the magic in your eyes
Is there a way to make you realize
There's no one more special to my heart
But you want us to be apart
I still love you

Why did you take away your love, baby
When did you think to just give up, yea
How am I supposed to carry on now
Without you

You were my world
You meant everything to me
You're the air I breathe
The song I sing
You were my queen, I was your king
But if we can try to work it
We'll show the world what love is about
Baby come on cause I can't take no more
Of this loneliness
And emptiness

Why did you take away your love
(Take away your love)
When did you think to just give up
(Oh...)
How am I supposed to carry on now
Without you

Why did you take away your love
When did you think to just give up
How am I supposed to carry on
Without you
You are my
You are my light
