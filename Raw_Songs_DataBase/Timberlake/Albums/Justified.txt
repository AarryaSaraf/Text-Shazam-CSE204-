// Senorita //

[Pharrell:]
Ladies and gentlemen
It's my pleasure to introduce to you
He's a friend of mine

[Justin:]
Yes, yes I am

[Pharrell:]
And he goes by the name...
Justin
Wowoowoooo

All the way
from Memphis, Tennessee
And he's got somethin' special for y'all tonight
He's gonna sing a song for y'all
About this girl

[Justin:]
Come in right here?

[Pharrell:]
Yea, come on

On that sunny day
Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl
Walking down the street
Seen those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down
She deserves a crown
But where is it now
Mamma listen

Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my...

Running fast in my mind
Girl don't you slow it down
If we carry on this way
This thing might leave the ground
How would you like to fly?
That's how my queen should ride
But you still deserve the crown
or hasn't it been found?
Mamma listen

Senorita, I feel for you
(Feel for you)
You deal with things, that you don't have to
(No, no)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
(He don't love ya baby)
But you could feel this real love
(Feel it)
If you just lay in my...

Ah, ah, arms...
(Won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms...
(Mama lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms...
(Baby won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms...

When I look into your eyes
I see something that money can't buy
And I know if you give us a try
I'll work hard for you girl
And no longer will you ever have to cry

Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
(Deal with things you don't have to)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
(No, no)
But you could feel this real love
(Feel it)
If you just lay in my...

Ah, ah, arms...
(Whoa)
Ah, ah, arms...
(My baby)
Ah, ah, arms...
(Oooh, yea)
Ah, ah, arms...

When I look into your eyes
I see something that money can't buy
And I know if you give us a try
I'll work hard for you girl
You won't ever cry

Now listen
I wanna try somethin' right now
See they don't do this anymore
I'ma sing something
And I want the guys to sing wit' me
They go
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
And then the ladies go
"I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you"

Guys sing
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
And ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Feels good don't it, come on
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Yea, ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Show the good to me

Sing it one more time
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Yea, yea..
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you

Gentlemen, good night
Ladies, good morning
[laughs]
That's it

// Like I Love You //

Just somethin' about you
Way I'm lookin at you whatever
keep lookin at me
Gettin' scared now, right?
Don't fear me baby, it's just Justin
It feel good right?
Listen

I kind of noticed something wasn't right
In your colorful face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me your face'll change......

If you smilin', that should set the tone
Just be limber
And If you let go, the music should groove your bones
Just remember
Sing this song with me

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

People are so phony
Nosy cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hating
When it doesn't matter anyway
Cause we're here tonight

If you smiling, that should set the tone
Just be limber baby
And If you let go, the music should groove your bones
Baby just remember
Sing this song with me

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you

Yeah, you know I can make ya happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance
To be your man
I won't let you down baby
If you give me that chance
To be your man
Here baby, put on my jacket
And then ...

Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl
Maybe we'll fly the night away(I just wanna love you baby)
Girl ...

[RAP]
Ma, what you wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
And the mall kids, that's how to change low
From them you heard "wow, it's the same glow"
Look at me, I say "yeah, it's the same dough"
We the same type, you my air of life
You have me sleeping in the same bed, every night

Go rock with me, you deserve the best
Take a few shots
Let it burn in your chest
We could ride down
Pumping N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play this free, joint called "brain"
(I just love your, Brain)
Ma, take a hint
Make me suerve in the lane
The name Malicious
And I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake
Now how heavy is that?

Maybe we'll fly the night away (I just wanna love you baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl
Maybe we'll fly the night away(I just wanna love you baby)
Girl ...

Ain't nobody love you like I love you
(Can't love you like I do)
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
(Trust ya like I do)
Late at night, I talk to you
(Hey)
You will know the difference when I

Break this down

You know, I used to dream about this when I was a
little boy
I never thought it would end up this way, Drums
(Hey)
It's kind of special right? yeah
You know, you think about it
Sometimes people just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is
Now everybody dance.

// (Oh No) What You Got //

Yea...

Mr. JT, now what you got for me
Mr. JT, now what you got for me
Mr. JT, now what you got for me
Mr. JT, now what you got, what you got

Mr. JT, now what you got for me
Mr. JT, now what you got for me
Mr. JT, now what you got for me
Mr. JT, now what you got, what you got

You're sneaky
From the corner of my eye I saw you eyeing me
I know that you're watching
Tell me
What would you do if I encouraged you
To get next to me
When nobody's watching

The way your body keeps moving
Is something that makes me weak
Let's start our own little secrets
For just you and me to keep
Too late to come off shy now
You've already gone this far
So baby make your move, take charge
Show me what you got for me

Oh no
(Girl)
Is that your hands, (your hands), rubbing on me
Oh no
(Girl)
Is that your hands, (your hands), feeling on me
Oh no
(Girl)
Is that your hands, (your hands), rubbing on me
If so
(Girl)
If that's your hands, (your hands), then tell me what you got for me

Baby, I can tell that you want to do more
Than just dance with me
And I don't mind you flirting
But honestly
Do you really wanna spend the whole night
Passing looks at me
(Looks at me)
Come over here and get to working

The way your body keeps moving
Is something that makes me weak
(Makes me weak)
Let's start our own little secrets
(Yea)
For just you and me to keep
(Us to keep)
Too late to come off shy now
You've already gone this far
So baby make your move, take charge

// Take It From Here //

Sometimes, sometimes the world gets hard

Oh na na na
I'm gonna take it from there girl
Don't you worry

I wanna be your lake or your bay
And any problems that you have
I wanna wash 'em away
I wanna be your sky
So blue and high
And everytime you think of me
I wanna blow your mind

I wanna be your air
So sweet and fair
So when you feel that you can't breathe
Ma, I'll be there

I wanna be your answer, all the time
When you see how I put your life before mine
With no question

When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'm gonna take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, everytime
Don't worry, girl
I'm gonna take it from here

I wanna hold your hands
Review all your plans
I wanna make sure everyone of your dreams will stand
I wanna be your broadway show on review
(Why)
So I can act out how God was when he made you
I wanna be your lighthouse when you get lost
I'll light a bright and shining path to help you across
I wanna be your mother, wait
See what I see
And when you see that can't nobody hold you like me
Cause I love you

When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'm gonna take it from here
(Take it from here, baby)
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, everytime
Don't worry, girl (no no)
I'm gonna take it from here

And when there's no one there to hold
And you realize the world is cold
Don't worry, girl
I'm gonna take it from here
That's what I'm gonna do
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, everytime
(Don't you worry, baby girl, baby girl)
Don't worry, girl
(Baby girl)
I'm gonna take it from here
(I'll take you whereever you want)

Give me one reason why we should not be leaving
This world is so deceiving, the time is now
Let's fly away speeding
Through the Garden of Eden
Where all the sweet breathing of love surrounds

When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'm gonna take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, everytime
Don't worry, girl (no no)
I'm gonna take it from here

Give me one reason
Why we should not be leaving
This world is so deceiving
The time is now
Lets fly away speeding
(We'll fly away)
Through the Garden of Eden
Where all the sweet and breathing
Of love surrounds
(Lets get away)

When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'm gonna take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, everytime
Don't worry, girl
I'm gonna take it from here
(I got somethin' I wanna tell ya baby)

Love ain't always the way they write in books
(No, no)
See there's the good guys
And also heartbreak crooks
Your hearts the real book
Just take a look inside
'Cause it's a colorful illustrated guide

So there you go
Don't worry
I'll be the one
To help you weather the storm
I'll be there mami
No matter what time
No matter what place
You can always count on me
I'll take it from here

// Cry Me A River //

You were my sun
You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no

You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance for you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it

You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn
To cry

Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river

Know that they say
That some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
(Don't act like you don't know it)

All of these things people told me
Keep messing with my head
(Messing with my head)
Should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it

You don't have to say what you did
(Don't have to say what you did)
I already know, I found out from him
(I already know)
Now there's just no chance for you and me
There'll never be
(No chance, you and me)
And don't it make you sad about it

You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone
(All alone)
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
(When you call me on the phone)
Girl I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
(I'm not like them baby)
The bridges were burned
And now it's your turn
(It's your turn)
To cry

So cry me a river
(Go on and just)
Cry me a river
(Go on and just)
Cry me a river
(Baby go on and just)
Cry me a river

The damage is done
So I guess I be leaving
The damage is done
So I guess I be leaving
The damage is done
So I guess I be leaving
The damage is done
So I guess I be leaving

You don't have to say what you did
(Don't have to say what you did)
I already know, I found out from him
(I already know)
Now there's just no chance for you and me
There'll never be
(No chance, you and me)
And don't it make you sad about it

Cry me a river
(Go on and just)
Cry me a river
(Baby go on and just)
Cry me a river
(You can go on and just)
Cry me a river

Cry me a river
(Baby go on and just)
Cry me a river
(Go on and just)
Cry me a river
(Cause I've already cried)
Cry me a river
(Ain't gonna cry no more)

Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river

Cry me a river
(Cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river
(Cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river
(Cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river
(Cry me, cry me)

// Nothin' Else //

I was just walking that day
Aimlessly
(Oh, oh no)
You picked a perfect day
To bump into me
(Perfect day, mmm)
Probably should've watched the stars in the sky 
The night before
(Heey, hey)
But for some reason
We still met at your store
(You, baby)
Your eyes have a story that they wish to tell
And I have my whole life
And I listen well
(Hey)
Look, I'll be your confidant
Tell me anything
But please start it off with how you tuck your wings 
(Ohhh ooo ohh)


There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it
Or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look
You don't know what you mean
To me
To me

All my friends meet you and say
You're the one
(You're the one, you're the one... hey ooo)
And all my meaningless friendships Should be done
(I should just leave them alone, baby, eh heh)
You had a friend
But he did you wrong
But I'm a God sent sign
That reads
Please move on
With me
(With me)

You taught me to use my heart 
And forget my eyes
(Use my heart... forget my eyes.. mmm)
And that's the way 
To His kingdom of eternal life
(ooh eh heh hehhh)
Since you're an angel, baby
Your job's never done
Too bad the world won't see you
When they dial 9-1-1
(That's why..)

There's nothin' else that I have seen
There's no getting around it
Or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look
You don't know what you mean
To me
(To me, to me, to me)
To me

There's nothin' else that I have seen
There's no getting around it
Or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look
You don't know what you mean
To me
(To me, to me, to me)
To me

There's nothin' else in this world
(Nothin' else)
Like you
(Yeah)
So why is it so complicated?
(So complicated)
What are you afraid of?

(Oooh, ooh)
I've been asking everybody 
What they think
(Yeah, yeah)
But I don't know why
Because they don't know you
(Oooh, ooh)
I'm even asking other guys
What would they say
(Yeah, yeah)
But I don't know why
'Cause they don't do what I do
(Oooh, ooh)
Girl, I say an ultimatums for you
(Yeah-yeah, yeah)
But you'd probably take that
And just run
(Oooh, ooh)
Now I gotta decide if I'mma help raise your mind
Seems like the ultimatums or me 
That's no fun

I was just walking that day 
Aimlessly

Da da da-dum
Da da da-dum
Da da da-dum
Dum dum dum...

// Last Night //

I just want to enjoy my life
And show this world how to care
And nothing brings more joy to my life
Than knowing my girl will be there

Are ya happy girl?
(Huh?)
Knowing that you right near broke my heart in a piece or two
(Huh?)
Knowing that I would have walked across the ocean for you
Saying you're young and confused
Well that's a lame excuse
That's why the only one to blame is you for

Last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'ma do for me what's right

In your eyes a see a second chance
Maybe I should take another glance
But for now I'll wash my hands
Cause I love ya baby, love ya baby
Pharrell say don't do it the same
But I say ain't playing my games
But for you my soul still remains
Cause I love ya baby, love ya baby

Are ya happy girl?
(Huh?)
Knowing that you right near broke my heart in a piece or two
(Huh?)
Knowing that I would have walked across the ocean for you
Saying you're young and confused
Well that's a lame excuse
That's why the only one to blame is you for

Last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'ma do for me what's right

I hope you're thinking
(Remember girl, when I was your man)
I hope it sinks in
(If you don't understand, then you don't understand)
We're gonna stop dreaming
(The way I feel)
About you

Last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'ma do for me what's right

Last night
(Just-a last night)
Can't believe what I was hearing
(Just can't believe it baby)
Telling me to have a nice life
(Oh)
So tonight
(Yea)
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'ma do for me what's right
(Got something I wanna tell ya girl)

I hope you're thinking
(Tell me girl, when I was your man)
I hope it sinks in
(If you don't understand, then you don't understand)
Well I guess I'm gonna stop dreaming
(The way I feel)
About you
(Let me tell you one more time)

I hope you're thinking
(Tell me girl, when I was your man)

Well I guess I'm gonna stop dreaming

About you

Oh baby
Yea yea yea yea
See I ain't gonna be the one
Ain't gonna play these games with you
But I still love you

Remember girl when I was your man
Ain't nothing gonna take that away
No no no no, no no-no

See I remember
In December
We were walking holding hands
And I was your man
Can't we just get back to that?
Baby?

// Still On My Brain //

The beautiful days are long gone
I can't seem to breathe
It feels like it hasn't been that long
Since you walked away from me
Now I can try to act real strong
But you and I both know I still think of you that way
You should know…that

The beautiful lights the star filled nights
They don't mean a thing
Cause you were my star and so it don't seem right
Without you here with me
Now I can try to act real strong
But you and I both know its hard for me to say
You were my soul…

Now I could say that I don't love you no more
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love
And I can tell you I feel It's time for us to go our separate ways
But baby I just wouldn't be the same
Cause girl your love is still on my brain 

Now when your in love it takes time to heal
When someone's broken your heart it changes how you feel
Girl I thought that you'd never do me that way
But even after all I still think of you that way

Now I could say that I don't love you no more
(I could say this and I could say that)
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love
And I can tell you I feel It's time for us to go our separate ways
But baby I just wouldn't be the same
Cause girl your love is still on my brain

Now love is a game that we both like to play
But will I win or lose if I go or if I stay
Even though I try to hide my broken heart inside
Girl you know me inside out and I can't get you off my mind

Now I could say that I don't love you no more
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love
And I can tell you I feel It's time for us to go our separate ways
But baby I just wouldn't be the same
Cause girl your love is still on my brain

// (And She Said) Take Me Now //

Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
What you waiting for?
I know you're watching me
Hey boy, come on and take me now

What you waiting for?
I know you're watching me
Hey boy, come on and take me now

Can I talk to you for a minute
You've been looking all night for your shining star

// Right For Me //

I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me

I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But you gotta work that thing right for me

Little baby with the sun dress on
Looking so damn right you're wrong
Make me wanna write my own little song for you
The way the thing just wiggle in the air
Turn around and then you flip your hair
I could think of a couple positions for you

Your wasting no time talking to me
Must be something you want me to see
Well baby girl don't mind me if I do
So take the stage just show me what you got
Feeling lucky let me touch your spot
Might be leaving with me before the night is through

I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me

I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But you gotta work that thing right for me

Your body's saying things I ain't never heard
You did the shake-shake and I kinda went beserk
Gotta give it to you girl you're one of a kind
When you took my hand up so calm
Touched it to your cherry lip balm
A million nasty things went through my mind

So baby tell me what you're doing later on
'Cause I'm thinking me and you could get along
Baby girl don't mind me if I do
So take the stage just show me what you got
Feeling lucky let me touch your spot
Might be leaving with me before the night is through

I got plans tonight
And you, you know what I like
And you're approaching me right
But I gotta make sure it's right for me
(You might be right for me)

I got plans tonight

And you're approaching me right
But you gotta work that thing right for me
(Yea, yea, work that thing right)

Yea
Bubba come stumblin' in
Get up huntin 'betty' with justin and them
We must be the flyest of southerner men
That's your girl, well buddy don't fumble it then

You better get her, I'm totally into my zone
Come on girl, close your eyes pretend it's your home
I will be puttin' my signature on
That thing I don't even wanna finish the song, lets go

I'm gettin discouraged with her
Too late now we're friends, I surely prefer
Listen to every word that I slur
Other dudes be huggin and nourishin her, not me

I bet you remember the night
Good ol' Bubba K came into her life
Test the water let me know if the temperature right,
Thank you ma'am, its certainly been a delight, uh-huh

I got plans tonight

// Let's Take A Ride //

Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you wanna feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby

Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you wanna feel the breeze?
And forget everything baby

Got laid off at your job today
You've been working at this place for years
And though you were underpaid
Mami that place isn't worth your tears
(Oh, oh)

I know that life is hard on you
And you can't seem to find out why
I'll explain, just grab your coat, girl
And just join me on this ride

Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away

Girl you're the best
You could be
An angel among society
But you get crushed
From what you see
You try to hard to help and that's enough for me
(Woo..)

Try to change what you can
And accept all the things that you cannot
(Don't stress yourself baby)
I know you wanna fly away from the world
But for now with the time we've got

Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away

Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away
(Let's just get away)
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away
(Let's just get away)

Maybe if you consider us just riding
That once you feel like a winner
No more crying
And baby I know just what you need
(I know)
To let your hair down so that you feel free, yea
(Hair, yea yea yea)

It hurts me to watch you sing the blues
(It hurts me baby)
Girl you're so confused
(Let's get away)
And I know what to do

Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away
(Let's just get away)
(Let's go, girl)
We can spend the night, till the morning light
(Night)
Let's just get away
(Let's just get away)

Let's take a ride
Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you wanna feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby
(Let's take a ride)
Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you wanna feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby

Let's take a ride
Let's go girl
Let's go girl
Let's go girl

// Never Again //

Would have given up my life for you
Guess it's true what they say about love
It's blind
Girl, you lied straight to my face
Looking in my eyes
And I believed you 'cause I loved you more than life
And all you had to do
Was apologize

You didn't say you're sorry
I don't understand
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man
That I used to be when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me, again

No, no, no, no, no, no

Sadness has me at the end of the line
Helpless watched you break this heart of mine
And loneliness only wants you back here with me
Common sense knows that you're not good enough for me
And all you had to do
Was apologize, and mean it

But you didn't say you're sorry
I don't understand
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man
That I used to be when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me

I wish like hell I could go back in time
Maybe then I could see how
Forgiveness says that I should give you one more try
But it's too late, it's over now

You didn't say you're sorry
I don't understand
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man
That I used to be when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me
Again

Again, yeah, yeah
Again, again, again, yeah, yeah, yeah
Never get to love me

// Worthy Of //

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Ohhh, Yeah, Yeah

Girl I find you so amazing
With everyday I learn more about you
The way you work day out and day in
And still find time for us too, yeah

I love the fact that you're there for me when I feel down
No matter what I'm going through
Lately I've been questioning myself
Am I good enough for you?

Am I worthy of?
Am I man enough?
Am I strong enough?
To maintain this love
You've got me questioning (yeah)
Got me wondering (yeah, yeah)
Could I be that man?
That can keep you happy

I know that there'll be times when I'll be miles away
And you'll be all alone
I constantly fight my insecurities
When I can't reach you by phone

And, oh, Lord knows that I'm only human
So please forgive me if I ask so many silly questions
I know that you truly love me but
Fear has me second-guessing

Am I worthy of?
Am I man enough?
Am I strong enough?
To maintain this love
You've got me questioning
Got me wondering
Could I be that man?
That can keep you happy

Girl excuse my ways (excuse my ways)
I'm not trying to push your love away (your love away)
It's just that sometimes my imagination gets the best of me, yeah
I still love you baby everyday, yeah yeah

Am I worthy of?
Am I man enough?
Am I strong enough?
To maintain this love (to maintain this love)
You've got me questioning
Got me wondering (you got me thinking about myself)
Could I be that man (am I good enough for you)
That can keep you happy (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Am I worthy of?
Am I man enough?
Am I strong enough? (strong enough, yeah)
To maintain this love (to maintain this love)
You've got me questioning
Got me wondering (you got me wondering, yeah)
