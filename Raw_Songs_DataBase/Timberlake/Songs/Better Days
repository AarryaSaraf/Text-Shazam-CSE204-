There's a light at the end of the tunnel
Keep your eyes on the road ahead
But if you're feeling lost in the night
It's okay to cry
Just as long as you hold your head

'Cause we're on our way to better
Better's ahead, better's ahead
It get's worse 'fore it gets better
But better's ahead, better's ahead
Better days are comin' (Better and better and better, ooh-ooh)
Better days are comin' (Ooh-ooh, better days)
Better days, better days (Better and better and better, oh-ooh)
Better days are comin' (Better days, better days)

I know you've been kicked down
Slept on, let down, faith gone
Waited for too long for something to lean on (Lean on)
You feel weak, just be strong (Ooh)
Deep breath, stay calm
If you just press on, press on, press on

You gon' see there's a light at the end of the tunnel (At the end of the tunnel)
Keep your eyes on the road ahead (On the road ahead)
And if you're feelin' lost in the night (Lost in the night)
It's okay to cry (It's okay to cry)
Just as long as you hold your head

'Cause we're on our way to better (Aah)
Better's ahead, (Better) better's ahead (Aah)
It get's worse 'fore it gets better (Ah-ah-ah)
But better's ahead, better's ahead
Better days are comin' (Better and better and better, ooh-ooh, I know, I know)
Better days are comin' (Ooh-ooh)
(Better days, better days) (Better and better and better, ooh-ooh)
Better days are comin' (Ooh-ooh)
(Better days, better days)

I know you feel left out and stepped on
Keep goin', keep goin'
Shine bright, don't dim yours for no one
Keep goin' higher, and higher and higher and higher

(Because there's better)
Better days, better days are comin' (Better days)
Better days, better days (On their way) are comin' ('Cause I know)
Better days, better days (Better days) are comin' (Yeah)
Better days, (Oh) better days are comin' (I know)
Better days are comin'
