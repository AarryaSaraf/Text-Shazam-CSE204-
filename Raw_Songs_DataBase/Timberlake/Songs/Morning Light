Look
Every time there's a new sunrise
I open up my eyes
And I say to myself, "In the whole wide world of guys
I must be the luckiest alive"

'Cause I'm in love with you
Laying here, in a morning light
And all I wanna do
Is hold you tight, just one more night


Look, I can't even get out of bed
With the thought you putting in my head
So I say to myself, "I don't even wanna try"
Here, every part of me is paralyzed


'Cause I'm in love with you
Laying here in the morning light
And all I wanna do
Is hold you tight just one more night
Yes, I'm in love with you
Laying here in a morning light
And all I wanna do
Is hold you tight, just one more night


I know I got somewhere to go
But I'm thinking we should lay here in love (lay here in love)
Ooh, 'cause baby, it's not lie
Ooh, I could watch you 'till the day I die


'Cause I'm in love with you
Laying here in the morning light
And all I wanna do
Is hold you tight just one more night
Yes, I'm in love with you
Laying here in a morning light
And all I wanna do
Is hold you tight, just one more, one more night
