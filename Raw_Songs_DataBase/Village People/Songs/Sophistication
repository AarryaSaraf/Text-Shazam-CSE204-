(Who-who) who do you think you are-are, (who-who) looks like a superstar
I'm not too impressed about what I've seen, you're wastin' your precious time starin' at me
You try to look mysterious but it ain't no big deal
So one more time to tell you that it's got to be real

(Who-who) who drives a foreign car-ar, (who-who) who thinks that he's a star
(Who-who) who takes their game too far, who needs some sophistication

You wear-ear (funny clothes) funny clothes, but that's as far as it goes
Halter neck Gucci, can take your life so far
You're not half the man that you think you are

Tell me (who-who) who has an attitude
Tell me (who-who) who's wearin' lots of jewels
I want to know (who-who) who's sometimes very crude
Who needs some sophistication

Who came into see them when you're not away
Everytime you turn around (what-what-what)
What you think you see-ee (what you think you see)
Ahh, was a Vegas scene, no-oh, it really isn't there
(Who-who) Who's living in the past, I wanna know 
(Who-who), who's moving much too fast, is it you 
(Who-who) who needs to find some class, who needs some sophistication

I'm not hard to please but your act is so unreal
And I hope you don't mind hearin' about how I feel
Take a look in the mirror 'cause the mirror won't conceal
Somethin' ain't ri-ight, you don't want to reveal

Tell me (who-who), who's gonna be your friend
I Wanna know-ow (who-who) when all the good times end
(Who-who) who needs to look okay, who needs some sophistication

Ah tell me, (who-who) who has a lot to learn (is it you), (who-who) as far as I'm concerned
Tell me (who-who) who's gonna end up burned, who needs some sophistication
