Mmmmmh Yeahhhh

I swear to you people, it must be my fate.
The cards were against me, now there's no escape.
I have this here problem, who keeps me up late.
(My roommate, my roommate.)

He thinks he's the greatest, dancer of all time.
He never stops dancin', he's out of his mind.
In the bathroom singing, a pitch out of time.
(My roommate, my roommate.)

I can't sleep the day, noon or night.
I can't sleep the day, noon or night.
(I can't take much more.)
(My roommate, my roommate, he's driving me insane.)
(My roommate, my roommate, he plays so many games.)
(My roommate, my roommate, he breaks all of the rules.)
(My roommate, my roommate, he is a dancing fool.)

I go to the closet, to put on my coat.
Instead on the hanger, I find pinned a note.
"I went to the disco, I took your best coat."
(My roommate, my roommate.)

I come home real early, thinking he's asleep.
Instead I am greeted, by big ugly feet.
"I've got this new dance step, five, six, seven, eight."
(My roommate, my roommate.)

I can't sleep the day, noon or night.
I can't sleep the day, noon or night.
(I can't take much more.)
(My roommate, my roommate, he's driving me insane.)
(My roommate, my roommate, he plays so many games.)
(My roommate, my roommate, he breaks all of the rules.)
(My roommate, my roommate, he is a dancing fool.)

He's a dancin' fool, ya'll.
Well, let me tell you about him.

Well, talkin' 'bout my roommate:

My roommate is the kind of guy,
who likes his music playin' high.
My roommate is the kind of guy,
who likes his music playin' high.
He dances all night, he dances all day.
He dances all night, he dances all day.
