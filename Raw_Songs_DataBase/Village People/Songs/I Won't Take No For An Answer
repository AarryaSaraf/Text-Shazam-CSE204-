When I saw you standing there
You were waving down compare
And I knew I had to get you
How I didn't care
When you caught my eye you lit a fire beneath
And it's burring burning to the ground
Flames surround me they won't let me be
It's too hard for me to forget

I won't take no for an answer
Until I get satisfied
I won't take no for an answer
Until I get satisfied
I won't take no for an answer
Until I get satisfied
I won't take no for an answer
No

When I looked into your face
And my heart begins to race
And I melt into the man
I'm gone without a trace
When you touch my hand
It's melting through my soul
I'm electrified like the night
Warnings there and maybe
You've been told
I won't give up I'm going to fight

I won't take no for an answer
Until I get satisfied
I won't take no for an answer
Until I get satisfied
I won't take no for an answer
Until I get satisfied
You know that I need it
I won't take no for an answer
No

I'm going to get you by my side
That where you wanna be
Your gonna be so satisfied
You'll never get away from me
I'm gonna give you what you need
Cause you've got what I want
Satisfaction guaranteed
Baby come on

I won't take no for an answer
Until I get satisfied
I won't take no for an answer
Until I get satisfied
I won't take no for an answer
Until I get satisfied
I won't take no for an answer
No
