A very merry Christmas to you
A very merry Christmas to you

Some girls and boys
Will open up toys
Some parents' hearts
Are filled with joy
Then there are some
Who may feel sad
But they're alive
And should be glad

For Christmas day is here to stay
Not like our dreams which fade away
Love will survive another day
Open your hearts, to you, to you I say

Merry Christmas
A very merry Christmas to you
I heard the children singing
A very merry Christmas to you
About the joy you're bringing
Laughing with joy, joy
Around the world
Today

A very merry Christmas to you
I heard that you've been
I heard that you've been singing
About the joy it's bringing
Laughing with joy, joy
Around the world
Today

A brand new year
Is very near
Let Christmas day
Fill you with cheer
Family and friends
Some young some old
We'll share this day
With heart and soul

You should be thankful
For what you've got
'Cause if you've got love
Then you've got enough

A very merry Christmas to you
Yeah, yeah, you've got a lot
A very merry Christmas to you
I heard the children singing
Laughing with joy, joy
Around the world
Today

A very merry Christmas to you
I heard the children
I heard the children singing
A very merry Christmas to you
About the joy it's bringing
Laughing with joy, joy
Around the world
Today
