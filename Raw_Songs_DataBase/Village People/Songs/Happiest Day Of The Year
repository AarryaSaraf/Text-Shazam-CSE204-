It's the happiest time of the year (Happiest time)
When family come from far and near
It's the happiest time of the year (Happiest time)
When family come from far and near

It's the happiest time, the happiest time
The happiest time of the year
It's the happiest time, the happiest time
When we all spread some cheer

People sharing all over the world (Happiest time)
People care about all boys and girls
So much love you can feel all around (Happiest time)
So much joy spread out over the town

People shopping for gifts to give out (Happiest time)
People running around all about
Some will hang on their doors mistletoe (Happiest time)
Stockings will hang from the fireplace for sure

It's the happiest time, the happiest time
The happiest time of the year
It's the happiest time, the happiest time
When we all spread some cheer
When we all spread some cheer
Oh

It's the happiest time, the happiest time
The happiest time of the year
It's the happiest time, the happiest time
When we all spread some cheer
When we all spread some cheer
Oh
