Baby, my will is wearin' thin, the walls are closin' in
I need you baby
My heart's about to break, it's cruel to make me wait
Come to me baby
We're movin' through the night, a symphony of flight
Fly with me baby
You wanna see me cry, oh can't you see me, I
I need you now-ow, I need you now-ow

Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
Your golden tresses feel like silk on my face
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
We're gonna be just great
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
I like that wiggle that you got in your jeans
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
You cast your spell on me

Baby, it's passion by design, with candlelight and wine
I want you baby
It's very clear to me, my love is what you need
Oh yes you do, you know you do-oo-oo

Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
Come lay beside me by the fireside
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
It's gonna be alright

Everybody, everybody knows that 
You're the hottest thing in town - Samantha
Everybody, everybody knows that 
I am gonna track you down - Samantha

Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
I want to kiss you like you've never been kissed
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
I never felt like this, Oh...

Baby, I need you now-ow-ow
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
I'm like a baby in a candy store
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
Come in and close the door
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
I'll show you my emotion night after night
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
My love won't be denied
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
Say yes and follow me to paradise
Sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-Samantha
