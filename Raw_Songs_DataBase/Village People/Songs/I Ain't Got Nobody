Cause I ain't got nobody 
Well it's - uh - nobody cares for me 
There's nobody cares for me 
Cause I'm so sad and lonely 
Sad and lonely, sad and lonely 
Won't some sweet mamma come take a chance with me 
Cause I ain't so bad 

And I'll sing her sweet love songs 
All of the time 
Hey, she'll only be, 
Only be 
The one and only one for me 

Cause I ain't got nobody 
And it's - uh - nobody cares for me 
There's nobody cares for me 
Nobody cares for me 
There's nobody cares for me 
Nobody cares for me 
There's nobody cares for me 

I'm just a gigollo 
And everywhere I go 
People know the part I'm playing 
Pay for ev'ry dance 
Selling each romance 
Oh what they're sayin' 

And there will come a day 
When youth will pass away 
Well well well well well 
What will they say about me 
When the end comes I know 
They'll say just a gigollo 
Life goes on without me 

Cause I ain't got nobody 
And it's - uh - nobody cares for me 
There's nobody cares for me 
Cause I'm so sad and lonely 
Won't some sweet mamma 
Come and take a chance with me 
Cause I ain't so bad 

Hey 

And I'll sing her sweet love songs 
All of the time 
Hey 
She'll only be, 
Only be 
Sugar 
Honey 
Darling 
Mamma 

I 
Ain't 
Got 
No 
Body 

Hey 

And it's - uh - nobody (nobody) 
No nobody (nobody) 
No one (no one) 
No no no one (no one) 
Loop de loop (Loop de loop) 
Sugar sugar (sugar sugar) 
Godess godess (godess godess) 
Girly girly (girly girly) 

Nobody (nobody) 
Oh yeah (oh yeah) 
Nobody (nobody) 
No no one (no one)
