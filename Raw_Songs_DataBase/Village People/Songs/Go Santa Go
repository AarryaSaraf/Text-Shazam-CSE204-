Hey hey, hey hey
Santa Claus is on the floor
Santa Claus, he wants some more
Santa Claus, he likes to get down
He likes to move his body round and round
Santa Claus, likes to have fun
Santa's work is never done
He likes to go out and pass out toys
To eight children, girls and boys

Santa's on the floor
Go Santa go
Santa wants some more
Go Santa go
Santa's on the floor
Go Santa go
Santa wants some more
Go Santa go

Santa Claus is on the floor
Santa Claus, he wants some more
He wants to hear you yell and scream
As he gets down but no on think
Santa Claus won't never stop
Santa Claus will stay on top
He'll throw his hands up in the air
And shake his body like he just don't care

Santa's on the floor
