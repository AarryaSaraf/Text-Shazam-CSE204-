I'm travellin' throu-ough this game called life
It's a tough game to play-ay, sometimes we play too rou-ou-ough
Now that I go-ot the final okay
You're tryin' so har-ard to take it all away

I've got my education, I've got determination
I've got imagination, come on give me a break
I've got my education, I've got determination
I've got imagination, come on give me a break

Well I started out my life, tried to find a better way
To live in this wor-orld from day-ay to day
Now people don't you know-ow-ow, don't you know-ow
Folks always sai-aid, you've got to reap just what you sew

I've got my education, I've got determination
I've got imagination, come on give me a break, give it up
I've got my education, I've got determination
I've got imagination, come on give me a break, give it up

Come on give me a break, give it up, (won't you give me a brea-eak)
Come on give me a break, give it up, (I deserve a fair sha-a-a-a-ake)
Come on give me a break, (give it up) won't you, give me, give me a brea-eak
Come on give me a brea-ea-eak

I'm a woman - I deserve a fair sha-a-ake
What you don't give, I will take

Oh I tried to find out, what this was all abou-ou-out
Everyone wanted to go their own way
You say I've got the right, no one can stop me now
I'm tryin' so har-ard and now I've learned how

I've got my education, I've got determination
I've got imagination, come on give me a break
I've got my education, I've got determination
I've got imagination, come on give me a break

Now I've got what I deserve, I have settled with my goa-oa-oal
Ain't nothin' I nee-eed, deep down in my ...
