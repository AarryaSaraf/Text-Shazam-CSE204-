Country's all I can see, just buildings and me
Standing here in the jungle
People out on the streets they're so hard to meet
I'm alone in the jungle
Workers living all day burn more than their pay
That's life in the jungle
Traffic's backed up for miles, can't see any smiles
Out here in the jungle

Jungle city
You gotta work so hard to make it to the top
Jungle city
You gotta break your back, no you can't never stop
Jungle city
You gotta work and work until you start to drop
Jungle city, jungle city

Soft fuels fill up the air, it's too much to bear
Down here in the jungle
Crime is here everywhere, some people don't care
It's the law of the jungle
Now it's time to be free, people can't you see
Dying here in the jungle
So hurry up don't you be late, they may lock the gate
You'll be lost in the jungle

Jungle city
You gotta work so hard to make it to the top
Jungle city
You gotta break your back, no you can't never stop
Jungle city
You gotta work and work until you start to drop
Jungle city, jungle city

Jungle city
You gotta work so hard to make it to the top
Jungle city
You gotta break your back, no you can't never stop
Jungle city
You gotta work and work until you start to drop
Jungle city
You gotta work so hard to make it to the top
Jungle city
You gotta break your back, no you can't never stop
Jungle city
You gotta work and work until you start to drop
Jungle city
