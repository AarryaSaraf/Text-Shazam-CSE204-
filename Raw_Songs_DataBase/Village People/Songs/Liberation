Liberation (libera-a-a-ation), liberation
It's time for liberation, (right now-ow-ow)
Liberation (libera-a-a-ation), liberation
It's time for liberation

Out of our way because we're ready to fly (liberation)
And for this right we stand here willing to die (liberation)
No we won't let those small minds stand in our way
If there's a price then we are willing to pay

Stand up and sing together all in one voice (liberatio-io-ion)
If you're in love with freedom you have no choice (liberatio-io-ion)
Even a child can see that now is the ti-i-ime
When will you learn my friend that you're satisfie-ie-ie-ied

Liberation (libera-a-a-ation), liberation
It's time for liberation (right now-ow-ow)
Liberation (libera-a-a-ation), liberation
It's time for liberation

We'll put an end to all this insanity (liberation)

We can't afford to waste our humanity (liberation)
Yes there are lives that we must stand up and shake
If there are contributions we're gonna make

We surely noticed that we won't be denied (liberatio-io-ion)
We are the winners, losers must step aside (liberatio-io-ion)
We have a job that simply has to get do-o-one
We're getting stronger yet we've only begu-u-u-u-un

Yea-ea-ea-ea-ea-eah (right now, right now, right now....)
Libera-a-a-ation, right now, right now-ow-ow
Yea-ea-ea-ea-ea-eah
Libera-a-a-ation, right now, right now-ow-ow

Liberation (libera-a-a-ation), liberation
It's time for liberation 
(We need some libera-a-a-ation)
Liberation, liberation, it's time for liberation
Libera-a-a-a-atio-io-io-ion
