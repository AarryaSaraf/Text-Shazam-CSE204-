Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle everyday
Jingle bells! Jingle bells!
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle everyday
Jingle bells! Jingle bells!

Jingle bells are in the air
Jingle bells are everywhere
You can hear them in the street
You can hear them in the beat
Everybody knows the sound
Can't you hear them all over town
Jingle bells they let you know
Christmas day is near for sure

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle everyday
Jingle bells! Jingle bells!
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle everyday
Jingle bells! Jingle bells!

Jingle bells fill the air
Telling people it's time to share
Have a good time, spread some joy
To our people, give a child a toy
There are needy people everywhere
Don't be greedy, it's time to care
Spread some love in the world
Time to share it with all boys and girls

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle everyday
Jingle bells! Jingle bells!
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle everyday
Jingle bells! Jingle bells!

Jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle bells! Jingle bells!

Jingle bells, jingle bells
