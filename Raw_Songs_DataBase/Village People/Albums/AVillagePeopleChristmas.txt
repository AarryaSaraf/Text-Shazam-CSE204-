// Go Santa Go //

Hey hey, hey hey
Santa Claus is on the floor
Santa Claus, he wants some more
Santa Claus, he likes to get down
He likes to move his body round and round
Santa Claus, likes to have fun
Santa's work is never done
He likes to go out and pass out toys
To eight children, girls and boys

Santa's on the floor
Go Santa go
Santa wants some more
Go Santa go
Santa's on the floor
Go Santa go
Santa wants some more
Go Santa go

Santa Claus is on the floor
Santa Claus, he wants some more
He wants to hear you yell and scream
As he gets down but no on think
Santa Claus won't never stop
Santa Claus will stay on top
He'll throw his hands up in the air
And shake his body like he just don't care

Santa's on the floor
Go Santa go
Santa wants some more
Go Santa go

// Happiest Day Of The Year //

It's the happiest time of the year (Happiest time)
When family come from far and near
It's the happiest time of the year (Happiest time)
When family come from far and near

It's the happiest time, the happiest time
The happiest time of the year
It's the happiest time, the happiest time
When we all spread some cheer

People sharing all over the world (Happiest time)
People care about all boys and girls
So much love you can feel all around (Happiest time)
So much joy spread out over the town

People shopping for gifts to give out (Happiest time)
People running around all about
Some will hang on their doors mistletoe (Happiest time)
Stockings will hang from the fireplace for sure

It's the happiest time, the happiest time
The happiest time of the year
It's the happiest time, the happiest time
When we all spread some cheer
When we all spread some cheer
Oh

It's the happiest time, the happiest time
The happiest time of the year
It's the happiest time, the happiest time
When we all spread some cheer
When we all spread some cheer
Oh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle everyday
Jingle bells! Jingle bells!
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle everyday
Jingle bells! Jingle bells!

Jingle bells are in the air
Jingle bells are everywhere
You can hear them in the street
You can hear them in the beat
Everybody knows the sound
Can't you hear them all over town
Jingle bells they let you know
Christmas day is near for sure

Jingle bells, jingle bells

Jingle bells! Jingle bells!
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle everyday
Jingle bells! Jingle bells!

Jingle bells fill the air
Telling people it's time to share
Have a good time, spread some joy
To our people, give a child a toy
There are needy people everywhere
Don't be greedy, it's time to care
Spread some love in the world
Time to share it with all boys and girls

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle everyday
Jingle bells! Jingle bells!
Jingle bells, jingle bells

// A Very Merry Christmas To You //

A very merry Christmas to you
A very merry Christmas to you

Some girls and boys
Will open up toys
Some parents' hearts
Are filled with joy
Then there are some
Who may feel sad
But they're alive
And should be glad

For Christmas day is here to stay
Not like our dreams which fade away
Love will survive another day
Open your hearts, to you, to you I say

Merry Christmas
A very merry Christmas to you
I heard the children singing
A very merry Christmas to you
About the joy you're bringing
Laughing with joy, joy
Around the world
Today

A very merry Christmas to you
I heard that you've been
I heard that you've been singing
About the joy it's bringing
Laughing with joy, joy
Around the world
Today

A brand new year
Is very near
Let Christmas day
Fill you with cheer
Family and friends
Some young some old
We'll share this day
With heart and soul

You should be thankful
For what you've got
'Cause if you've got love
Then you've got enough

A very merry Christmas to you
Yeah, yeah, you've got a lot
A very merry Christmas to you
I heard the children singing
Laughing with joy, joy
Around the world
Today

A very merry Christmas to you
I heard the children
I heard the children singing
A very merry Christmas to you
About the joy it's bringing
Laughing with joy, joy
Around the world
Today
