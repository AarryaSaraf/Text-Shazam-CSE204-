// Acura Integurl //

She singing, "Bitch, I'm paid, that's all I gotta say."
I'm like, who knew? Who knew? Who knew?
That after all the years, I'd make a Weezy fan
Out of you too, you too, you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke
Chris Martin and U2, U2, U2
When you met me, I was Three 6, Pimp C
Bun B, 8-Ball and MJG, yeah

But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radio's on, always

I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying "Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me"
My girl found it in the car and said
"Baby, why you trying to diss me?"
'Cause you know you're my baby
Oh, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride

Yeah, oh, ah
Yeah, oh, ah
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh

You said, "One day, I'll start up my car and it'll explode."
Well, now that's the last time I'm letting you watch Casino alone
You hate when I leave you in the motel while I hunt for jobs
So now I let you drive and wait outside in the parking lot

I know we're both a long way from home
Just keep the windows down, the radio's on, always

I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying "Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me, kiss me, kiss me"
My girl found it in the car and said
"Baby, why you trying to diss me, diss me, diss me?"
Don't you know you're my baby?
Don't you know you're my baby, ooh?
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah

You'll live a better life
(A better life, young one, a better life, young one)
A dull life ain't nothing
Don't speed, who cares what car you're driving?
No Benz can make you friends
She don't care what car I'm driving
And no Bentley can kiss me back
This song is dedicated to my '91 Acura
My 1991

// Bedtime Story //

My pillows ain't giving no comfort
And the fan is blowing way too loud
Even my heartbeat wakes me up
And I can't drown it out

Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count

Ain't slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh

I never really liked this apartment, no
There's not enough windows
That ain't the reason you left
I did that by myself
But I wish you'd come back before the sun comes up again

Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count

Ain't slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh

You gotta let me read just a page of you baby
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way
Where's my bedtime story
Just three words to my bedtime story, bedtime story oh

Every time I lay my head down
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm thinking of you
Baby I-I'm thinking of you
Every time I lay my head down
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm thinking of you
Baby I-I'm thinking of you

Ain't slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh

You gotta let me read just a page of you baby
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way
Where's my bedtime story
Just three words to my bedtime story, bedtime story oh

I love you, I love you

// Blasted //

She's the prettiest girl I've ever seen on a skateboard
And I'm just a guy with a couple of open ears for her
She told me every story behind all of her tattoos
She's thinking maybe the next one should have something to do with me, to do with me

Okay, well you gotta do mine in color
Cause all of your exes are in black and white

You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul

Said you should get a Rubi's Cube over your heart
But you say I've already figured it out
Already figured out the love
She want me to get a spaceship tatted inside of my lip
Cause that's what she feel like she on when we on each other
Loving on each other, kissing on each other

Okay, well you gotta do mine in color
Cause all of your exes are in black and white

You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul

Paper to pen, needle to skin
I'm in the chair
And she's over there
Taking these pictures
And blowing me kisses
When I asked her to hold my hand
She told me to take that ink like a man
Told me to take that ink like a man
Told me to take that ink like a man
She told me that, told me that

You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul

// Bricks And Steel //

If a tree fell in the forest
And no one was around to hear it
Baby, does it go boom?
Does it go boom?
If I have love for ya
But you were never close enough to feel it
Is my love any good?
Is my love any good?
Oh

But the distance ain't even a room away
You're laying in the bed right next to me
But there might as well be a brick wall in between us
Some soundproof glass
And some bars in the middle
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I'm conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulder
You're cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel

How do I stay in love with your rubbish
All the leftovers and garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel

I know you're somewhere in there
Sometimes I wanna pick up a hammer
And start chiseling away, away
Chiseling away, away
Girl my phone bill is crazy
The rate is sky high when I call ya
But you only let it ring
You only let it ring, oh

But the distance ain't even a room away
You're laying in the bed right next to me
Oh but there might as well be a brick wall in between us
Some soundproof glass
And some bars in the middle
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I'm conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulders
You're cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel

And how do I stay in love with your rubbish
Shorty leftovers in garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel

Stomp, stomp
I think I hear 'em coming down the hall
He don't hear a word I say at all
I'm wishing these 4 walls could talk, talk
Oh, stomp, stomp
I think I hear 'em coming down the hall and
He don't hear a word I said, oh, oh, oh

Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I'm conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulders
You're cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel

How do I stay in love with your rubbish
All the leftovers and garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel

// Broken Pieces //

Reminiscing on a younger love
Blowing kisses to me through the window of the bus
Daddy told you that I was dangerous
But I couldn't stop hustling, even if he asked me
Fast forward now we're grown-ups
But how could I forget that loving you was such a rush
Our future could've been different
But let's just say I wouldn't stop hustling even when you asked me
But you knew me well, you knew I had a love on a different scale
Heavy as the heavens, you could tell
I'm different now but I still carry her with me still
It takes a strong young man to survive out here
Carrying the pieces of two hearts
All the broken pieces of two hearts
Used to have a backpack full of that work
Now I got a backpack full of this hurt
And the broken pieces of two hearts
All the broken pieces of two hearts
It's getting heavier

// Can't Be The Last Time //

Oh, wait a minute baby girl can we just sit down
There's a couple things we need to talk about
Like when you get mad at me, do you really mean what you say?
Or is it just one of them days, when things ain't going your way?
Can we talk about it without the shouting?

I know we got issues, don't wanna lose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think it's time to rewind and start all over again

Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
'Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know it's hard
But we can't let it go, 'cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But it won't be the last time, can't be the last time

Can't be the last time, that you get mad at me
For forgetting every little anniversary
Something silly like me leaving up the toilet seat
And it can't be the last time, when you say I don't do this
When you say I don't do that, but you know I ain't perfect
Got no way to explain it, but I know we can make it

I know we got issues, I don't wanna lose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think it's time to rewind and start all over again

Everybody has there arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
'Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know it's hard
But we can't let it go, 'cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But it won't be the last time, can't be the last time

Girl, I love the things you do
Reminds me of the reasons why I'm with you
Like when you walk out the door
When your clothes hit the floor
You were just about to break up
And now we 'bout to make up (yeah yeah)
Uh oh oh, oh oh oh ooh whoa
Girl just say yeah
Oh oh oh oh, let's make up, oh

Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
'Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know it's hard
But we can't let it go, 'cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But it won't be the last time, it can't be the last time

Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
'Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time

But we can't let it go, 'cause they wanna see us apart

But we can't let it go, 'cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down

// Day Away //

It's 12:07 and I'm thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)
8 minutes ago it was all OK, yeah
I wish the year was just missing one day
I'm wishing I could forget it
'Cause it's still so hard to live with it

I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoe box under my bed
And I swear, every conversation that I have
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know
Maybe if I board a plane, I could be at the sunrise
Better yet grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks (those damn clocks)
No, I don't wanna think about him
I don't wanna dream about him
I don't wanna talk about him
I don't wanna call him
This day doesn't even exist
I keep praying that it won't exist no more

Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wishing the day go away, day go away, today go away

It's 6:47 still thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)
Walking on 42nd tryna clear my brain (no, oh)
He packed his luggage and he left, but some of it still remains
So for 24 hours I'll been sitting here staring at his baggage in my space

I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoe box under my bed
And I swear, every conversation that I have
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know
Maybe if I board a plane, I could be at the sunrise
Better yet grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks (those damn clocks)
No, I don't wanna think about him
I don't wanna dream about him
I don't wanna talk about him
I don't wanna call him
This day doesn't even exist
I keep praying that it won't exist no more

Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wishing the day go away, day go away, today go away

See I don't even wanna think about him
Or dream about him
Even just one day is one too long
There ain't no sense in bringing it up or bringing memory round
'Cause ain't no getting back the love is gone
I won't be crying no more no water will fall
The storm has passed and gone
And I wish amnesia would stay
I don't wanna remember, not even for just one day

Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wishing the day go away, day go away, today go away

// Dying For Your Love //

Do you remember, that October night
The twenty ninth, I almost lost my life
Call myself being a hero trying to guard your heart
No matter how hard I fought, it was over before it started
I thought that we were

On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
I guess what we have doesn't matter

You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love, I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

All I ever did was just try to play my part
Try to be the man who would not let you get taken advantage of
But you let it go on, and every time I see you with him
I wanna crack his dome, (t-tell me that I'm wrong)
But I thought we were

On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
Guess what we have doesn't matter

You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

You have me dying
Fighting, every night
Dying
Fighting, every night

You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

On the same side of the battle, oh

// Greedy Love //

I hated every time we go out
Got everybody complementing you
You love attention from a big crowd
Feels like I'm on the sideline
Right next to sucker, and I am the buster, girl
Who's this other guy, that's sending you these flowers
Oh, now you tell me, that your ex is your best friend

Call me crazy
But all I want is you
To myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous
But I just call it my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love

The smile on your face when you got that text late at night wasn't 'cause of me
Who else could it be?
And why when your with your friends it's always movie night or girls' night
It feels like I'm riding the bench
Right next to sucker, and I am the buster, girl
On the dance floor you're showing off your best moves
You've see my blown fuse, 'cause everybody's on you

Call me crazy
But all I want is you to myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love

The only thing I wish is all that's in your heart
Though it seems like I'm nagging, oh
Is wanting only me too much to ask?

When all I want is you to myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love

// Hardest Thing //

Maybe I should just be clear
It sucks not having you here
There ain't a better way to say
Other than how I just said it, clear, clear, clear, clear
Like a bottle of Evian, you can see through me
My ego ain't here

So many clever words and nice things that I could say
But the truth then and the truth now has been the same

The hardest thing to say is what I ain't saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can't run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you, still

I try to go some months without a call
I mean, I'm an attractive guy and all
Maybe I could find something in the club
Or something in the mall, mall, mall
But them girls didn't matter
And this money ain't distracting me much at all

I know some clever words and nice things that I could say
But the truth then and the truth now have been the same

The hardest thing to say is what I ain't saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can't run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you

Girl I wanted to cry
But I made it look easy (it ain't easy)
To hold it in and save face
And it was harder to stay
So I made it look easy (it ain't easy)
To just get up and walk away
Now I'm alone and the tears do fall
Open my mouth and the words do fall
Now I'm standing here after all, with this broken heart

The hardest thing to say is what I ain't saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can't run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you, still

// I Need Love //

Every girl that I met on tour
I knew none of them would last
Cause it wouldn't work, nah it wouldn't work
A hundred chick contacts in my phone
About half of them I smashed
I put in work, oh, I put in work
But there's something missing there though
Feels like I've gotta Lambo' with no gas to go
And I've got all the world, nothing to show
That girl just let me know

I need love
Yeah, I need you, yeah, I need you
I need love
Yeah, I need you, oh I need

I wouldn't do it, nah, no
Cause fifteen days ago
Never knew you, so never knew how this felt
Had no clue, I was too cool
But now I can't go a day without ya'
I wake up eating breakfast thinking 'bout ya'
We'll go around the world, don't ever go
No, don't ever leave me 'lone

// If I'm In Love //

I got a question I wanna ask my momma
But she's been gone for some years now
I need the answers, I want to ask my friends
But they're to cool to be honest
And she's gone take it the wrong way if I question her
It just might break her heart, man
I can't ask my girl

So I'm gonna ask Lennon
And I'm 'a ask Donny
And I'm 'a ask Stevie
And I'm 'a ask Prince
If I'm in love
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie, if I'm in love
Tell me, tell me
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie, if I'm in love
Tell me, tell me
Am I in love?

Who the hell knows who Purple Rain is?
And am I standing in it?
I sing along to every single word though
And I feel like I need them
'Cause for all I know
Rocket love flew past me yesterday
But I gotta know for sure

So I'm gonna ask Lennon
And I'm 'a ask Donny
And I'm 'a ask Stevie
And I'm 'a ask Prince

// J.O.B. //

I catch Zs at work now
So they're gonna fire me soon
But I've been dreaming of our love
I wish my new day job was you

But they say my checks come from the bank
And not your heart (not your heart)
And not your heart
They tell me think with my brain like I'm sane
And not my heart
And not my heart

But if my job was only to love you, yeah
There wouldn't be no recession
Be no recession, ain't no depression, depression
If my job was only to love you, girl
There wouldn't be no stressing
Be no stressing, ain't no pressure
'Cause it pays way better babe
It pays way better baby, yeah

My boss works my nerves, girl
If you knew him you'd wanna quit too
I just know he's jealous
Cause he's lonely and I've got you
(But what I'mma do)

But they say my checks come from the bank
And not your heart (not your heart)
And not your heart
They tell me think with my brain like I'm sane
And not my heart

But if my job was only to love you, yeah
There wouldn't be no recession
Be no recession, ain't no depression, depression
If my job was only to love you, girl
There wouldn't be no stressing
Be no stressing, ain't no pressure
Cause it pays way better babe

If I left this place today with the love that we made
I'd be paid for the rest of my life, rest of my life
I love you the rest of my life, oh
Be paid for the rest of my life
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

// James Fauntleroy - Dying For Your Love //

Do you remember, that October night
The twenty ninth, I almost lost my life
Call myself being a hero trying to guard your heart
No matter how hard I fought, it was over before it started
I thought that we were

On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
I guess what we have doesn't matter

You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love, I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

All I ever did was just try to play my part
Try to be the man who would not let you get taken advantage of
But you let it go on, and every time I see you with him
I wanna crack his dome, (t-tell me that I'm wrong)
But I thought we were

On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
Guess what we have doesn't matter

You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

You have me dying
Fighting, every night
Dying
Fighting, every night

You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

On the same side of the battle, oh

// Kamikaze //

Look up, look up, look up
You'll see the lies flying in the air
Reach out, reach out
Try to catch one if you can

Oh, right now they're flying
Circling and coasting the sky
When they come crashing down
It'll be the worst surprise

But you just right stand there
You ain't looking 'round
And baby, you won't never see it coming
Causing kamikaze
On they're way down to you
But you won't never see 'em
Oh no, you'll never know he's lying
'Til you look up
And I bet you'd catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

Feels like I'm on the 30th floor
Staring out my window
See them, they about to crash
Right into you
You're marching on the sidewalk
Umbrella up, oblivious
No clouds, shades on, no sun

Oh, right now they're flying
Circling and coasting the sky
When they come crashing down
It'll be the worst surprise

But you just right stand there
You ain't looking 'round
And baby, you won't never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze
On they're way down to you
But you won't never see 'em
Oh no, you'll never know he's lying
'Til you look up
And I bet you'd catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

Look up, look up
You better look all around, all around
Baby you better
Look up, look up, I know
They're coming down, coming down
They're coming down
Look up, you better look up
Look up, look up, look up, look up

But you just right stand there
You ain't looking 'round
And baby, you won't never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze
On they're way down to you
But you won't never see 'em
Oh no, you'll never know he's lying
Till you look up
And I bet you'd catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

Look up, look up
And baby you'll see the light
You'll see him flying
Look up, look up
You'll see the lies
No, look up, look up

Flight 143 was just on the ground

// Know Better //

Aye, listen
It's Lonny
Wait a sec
OK, go

Hey let me tell you something
Don't be fronting like he ever did it like I does it
Every time you wanna argue and stress
You always say you could've stayed with your ex
Well I guess you coulda
But deep inside I know that you don't wish you woulda
'Cause when you was with him
You was always checking for the kid
Late night coming to my crib

I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
He ain't quite me, like me
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better

So so so, tell, tell me, tell me something
You really think it'd be that easy just to let me go
I know I try to play it cool when we fuss
But truth be told, my heart would be crushed
('Cause it's just for you)
I'm trying to settle down
(Tell me who)
You know could make you smile
(Like I can do)
Tell me who, tell me who

I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
Like me, like me
I, I know that you'll never finder
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better

So, so, so
Baby I know
That without you I'd be broken down
But you'd feel the same
If I went away
Why can't you just say it?
Just say it! Just say it!
Forget it baby, it's cool
'Cause I already know

I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
He ain't quite me, like me
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better

I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
Like me, like me

Stop the truck, hand my keys to the valet
That's the moment that I see her as she leaving
I say excuse me, how could I convince you to stay?
Then my phone goes to ringing in, ringing in

Could you wait, it really won't be long?
(And then the kid came) told me he was my biggest fan
Camera flashes, turn around and she's already gone

// Miss You So //

I'll stack these magazines in the corner
After I'm done with them
And I still got the same hope that I started with
That you'll be in one of them
My camera shed some tears since you left him
With nothing, with nothing

How am I supposed to remember?
I got the memories
But memories fade, baby
What am I gonna show to my kids, girl?
When I'm older, and my mind is telling me to forget you
What's gonna make me remember?

That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so

We didn't make love
We celebrated its invention
Confetti on the mattress – I used to have those images
Tonight I came home they were just embers in the fire
Along with my hard drive, no notes, no goodbye

How the hell am I supposed to remember?
Tell me now, I got the memories
But memories don't last
What am I gonna show to my kids, baby?
When I'm older, and my mind's telling me to forget you
What's gonna make me remember?

That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you

No videos, no Polaroids
No record of the love we had
My Nikon wasn't fast enough
To catch my heart break in half
No smiles on my picture frame, no
Just got them little basic ones that the pictures frames come with
Models, wedding pictures, you know

That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures?
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so

// No Bonnie //

I'm running from the man, I'm running from my flag
I made love to my lady before I packed
I left her while she slept
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glovebox
I left the keys to the car by the bed
'Cause I got her

Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
But I won't risk her life for mine
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie, I'm sorry, so sorry

I'm running water through my hands
And flipping pictures in my head of her
I wish I taught the girl how to shoot a gun
So I wouldn't worry as much
Oh, last night
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glovebox
I left the keys to the car by the bed
'Cause I got her
(I got you, oh)

Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(I wish you could be my Bonnie)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(Won't risk your life)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(I know you love me)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(You wanna be where I am, but no, girl)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie

The money should last awhile
But I know without a dime she got me
When the feds come around she got me
No snitching allowed from my baby

Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(My Bonnie)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(My Bonnie)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie
(No Bonnie)
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(Oh girl, I wish you could be mine)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(Won't you risk your life, no Bonnie, your life)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie, I'm sorry, so sorry

So sorry
So sorry
No Bonnie

// No Love //

// Non-Stop //

I'm knocking on your door, and it's cold, yes it's cold
But I brought your favorite flowers, teddy bear and a card
Cause I know that loving me is a chore, it's a chore
But I won't stop loving you that's for sure, that's for sure

You could open your window baby
And ask me to go away
But there's no way, no how I'll stop loving you
It's non-stop, oh no, oh no, oh no
It won't stop, oh no, oh no, oh no
This love is gonna keep going, it ain't gonna slow
It's non stop, oh no, oh no, oh no

I sat down in my car, not to leave, just to park
I'm still not losing hope, though the sky's getting dark
I wish you'd just peak out the blinds to my heart
But you turned your bedroom light on
Well at least that's a start

You could open your window baby
And ask me to go away
But there's no way, no how I'll stop loving you
It's non-stop, oh no, oh no, oh no
It won't stop, oh no, oh no, oh no
This love is gonna keep going, it ain't gonna slow
It's non stop, oh no, oh no, oh no

Said I'm sorry, oh baby
But the love won't stop, no no, nah uh
Take me back, oh love, take me back
Cause the love will keep flowing on
The love will keep flowing on

// Ohh In Love //

Fairy-tales come and take my hand
Turn the page and help me understand
Maybe, I'll fall in love again
If I know how the story ends
Her song has me
Looking for traces of my melody
And I slowly hum, sing the simple phrase
And not another she can deny
Caught in the sound waves
She can feel my every line
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words
For her, yeah

So ohh in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the song she loves
And I never thought I'd say this baby

Found a way to whisper in her ear
Everything I wanted her to hear
Said I would catch her every tear
Hold her through the many years
So long I've been looking
For chances of this heart in me
Now I know that she's the lyric and the tune
That explains the meaning of life
There is no music
Without her to give it to me
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words
For her, yeah

So in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the song she loves
And I never thought I'd say this baby

So in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the one she loves
And I'm hoping that she plays me

Ohh in love

// Old Terror //

No baby don't do that, don't touch that
Could you please be still? (Baby, stop)
No baby, you can't have that, until you eat your dinner
Guess I gotta treat you like a baby girl

You're the cutest, you're the cutest thing, oh oh
But you can't always get your way, like a baby girl
I wanna keep that smile on your face, all for it
But it ain't easy, you won't make it easy

You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two-year-old terror, a twenty-two-year-old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
'Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two-year-old terror, twenty-two-year-old terror

Now you know you should be sleeping, but OK
I'll give you ten more minutes
We've been sleeping in the same bed
'Cause you've been having nightmares
And you need me here
I guess I always treat you like a baby girl

You're the cutest, you're the cutest thing aw yeah
But you can't always get your way, like a baby girl
I wanna keep that smile on your face, uh huh
But it ain't easy, no it ain't easy

You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two-year-old terror, a twenty-two-year-old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
'Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two-year-old terror, twenty-two-year-old terror

You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two-year-old terror, a twenty-two-year-old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
'Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two-year-old terror, twenty-two-year-old terror

You want love? Well no more sugar for you
And you don't know how to act, so no more sugar for you
You're jumping off the walls, no more sugar for you
I said ain't no sugar for you
Well, just a little bit, but

You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two-year-old terror, a twenty-two-year-old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
'Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two-year-old terror, twenty-two-year-old terror

You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two-year-old terror, a twenty-two-year-old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
'Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two-year-old terror, twenty-two-year-old terror

// One Look //

I've seen it and I liked it much
I told myself I had to have it
I looked, but I do not touch
Wondering why does she walk like that (that, that)
There was something in those jeans
Locked up
It was dying to be free
And it was bound to happen, oh

Didn't have a pick up line to use
I was way too cool, way too cool
And instead I hoped you're watching me too
Like I watched you

It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, I couldn't run away from you
No, I couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

That's a good look baby, baby
That's a good look, darling
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look

My eyes must have been on drugs
Your color and your shape looked so crazy
I couldn't see the floor beneath you
But, baby, I could see you pacing on
Thin air, mid-air, no
Long brown hair swinging, no
Red bottoms in your high heels
Like I'm watching a Blu-Ray

You in HD baby
I didn't know what to say
I was way too cool, I'm way too cool
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
And I, you know I'm hoping you're watching me too
Oh yeah, you know it's true

It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, I couldn't run away from you
No, I couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

I wanna stare at you some more
When I can feel you in my soul
I'm not looking from the outside
I could feel your hands in mine
I wanna grab on your body
Touching that booty
Feeling on your booty
Say that you love it
And you said it's all mine

It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, I couldn't run away from you
No, I couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, couldn't run away from you
No, couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

That's a good look baby (baby)
That's a good look, darling
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look
That's a good look baby (baby)
That's a good look, darling
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look

// Open Air //

I had my feet in the water
And right when I was about to get up
Oh, suddenly I caught ya
With a hook line and a sinker
You were swimming at the bottom, yeah
I said why you gon' live down there
Well baby you can love up here, on land
And what a difference it makes, you'll see
What a difference it makes to breathe in
What a difference, it makes it easy to love

The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air's so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

You said you're feeling ways
That you never could've felt under all that pressure
Used to it being dark at night, and you're kinda afraid of the lights
But you still crack a smile, because it makes you feel alive
And what a difference it makes, you'll see
What a difference it makes to breathe in
What a difference, it makes it easy to love

The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air's so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

Baby I could show you the world
And the seed that's inside of my heart, baby
Don't know how you got on land in the first place
Just promise you won't go back again
It's better up here you know
Just trying my best to show you
But you started feeling like you're floating higher and higher
Don't ever go under no more

The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air's so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air's so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

All these memories feel
Like a thousand pounds, oh my
In my bed trying to sleep
The ceiling lowers down
I feel it on me now

I been moving buses, further and further

Overload, overload, but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me

Trying to make by, I'm trying
On the other side, someone's tugging hard
They only getting stronger, oh, I
Balance bricks on shoulders
With the grit in my shoes
I'm not strong enough
Help me out, help me out

I been moving buses, further and further
I just can do this alone

I been pulling airplanes, higher and higher
I just can't move them alone
And I just can't move them alone

But can somebody lend a hand, it's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, overload
Take over for me, it's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me

I been trying to hold up the world with both my hands
Been holding the world in both my hands
Can't hold up the world
It's coming down, it's coming

It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, overload, take over for me
It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand, it's too heavy for me

Overload, overload, overload

// Read The Stars //

I heard my teacher say that I'd be better off
If I just took what I've been given
They said I never know what to do
Unless I'm told
I feel underestimated, so unaccounted for
Then you want to call me to your office right after school
And tell me your version of my future

But let's take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don't talk me out of it
Don't talk me out of it
It's my life, don't talk me out of my life
It's my life

I used to put an apple on Ms. Jacob's desk
But she never liked me
She said I'm gon' fail, no matter what I give
She said 'cause my skin wasn't light enough
Tuition wasn't high enough
I couldn't understand just what I did
So underestimated, you left me unaccounted for
Now you want to call me to your office right after school
And now you wanna tell me, your version of my future

But let's take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"

Don't talk me out of it

You tore me down till there was nothing left
Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
I'm still standing
Look at me
Look at me now, look me in my eyes

But let's take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"

// Real //

Ever since you came into my life I been moving closer to
Tryna build a vault around the both of us
When you're gone baby I ain't cool
No I ain't cool no, I can't move
And I don't know what the hell is happening to us
But I don't wanna know because it feels like something that I want
And baby I ain't never fell in love but if this is what they talk about then I don't ever wanna get up
They say it's infatuation
I say I don't care what you name it

Baby I'm losing my air, I can't breathe love
And I feel like I'm blind, I can't see it love
And as sweet as it is, I can't taste it
But I know it's real love, real love
As the sky is blue, as the moon and the air change colors
Real, I'm in love with you for real, for real

No I don't care who wants to question us or break us up
'cause I'd lose a thousand friends for what I got with you
Right here baby I'm all good, yup, I'm all good, ah
I'm all good, oh
And I don't want nothing but your heart and trust
Every little tender touch
And I know love ain't only made for us but I feel like we own it
Feel like we own it
And I already know what they say, they swear that we will never make it
But if I lost you today it'd be real just the same

Baby I'm losing my air, I can't breathe love
And I feel like I'm blind, I can't see it love
And as sweet as it is, I can't taste it
But I know it's real love, real love
As the sky is blue, as the moon and the air change colors
Real, I'm in love with you for real, for real

Oh I know it all can't be just a figment of imagination
A dream that won't come true
I know it all can't be just and illusion
I know what you're doing to me

Baby I'm losing my air, I can't breathe love
And I feel like I'm blind, I can't see it love
And as sweet as it is, I can't taste it
But I know it's real love, real love
As the sky is blue, as the moon and the air change colors
Real, I'm in love with you for real, for real

// Richest Man In The Room //

Got a heart full of gold, that I own
The clothes on my back and a pencil
I can draw my own money
You wouldn't even tell the difference
But I just can't sketch the feeling
I get when you're not home
Or recreate the paintings
You've hung onto my soul

Oh, oh but I bet they're worth millions
Oh, beautiful works of love
Oh, I'm a go to all the fancy places
All the fancy people and
They can't tell me nothing, nothing

'Cause they all want what I got
And I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can't buy what I got
'Cause I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room

She got a heart made of glass
What's inside of it's like lightning in a bottle
Now what would that be worth in your museum
Recently we traded
And now that hearts my own
And since we're sewed together
I feel like I got both

Oh, and I bet they're worth millions
Oh, beautiful works of love
Oh, I'm a go to all the fancy places
All the fancy people and
They can't tell me nothing, nothing

'Cause they all want what I got
And I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can't buy what I got
'Cause I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room

Time itself wants what I got
So I don't care about what you've got
All I know is my girl is precious
You make me better, baby
You make me happy, baby
Nobody needs to remind me exactly why I'm
The richest man in the room

'Cause they all want what I got
And I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can't buy what I got
'Cause I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you

'Cause they all want what I got
And I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can't buy what I got
'Cause I ain't got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room

// Rocket Love //

"Three minutes forty five seconds and counting, we are still a go at this time"

Listening to Star Trek's star tracks
On the track to stars and back
Only after we get to the end

Passing planets feeling small
On the mattress floating off
How you breathing up here with nothing on, nothing on, baby girl

But you look good in your spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Oh, up here, up here

I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they're burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh

"Two minutes ten seconds and counting"

The candle's burning in the sun
We don't need them but you like them
They glow they glow, oh yeah
We were at the bar for quite a while
Took some time but we collided
Big bang, big bang, look at what we made beautiful

But you look good in that spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Oh, up here, up here

I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they're burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh

We can make believe that we're up there
But we're only in the backseat of this eclipse ooh
If the lights go by, that means the cops flew by
But they won't bother us, no no no no

I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they're burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they're burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh

I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they're burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they're burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh

// Scared Of Beautiful //

Turn a lamp on
Let me talk to you
See that light bulb, does something to you
Makes it a little harder to tell a lie don't it?
Make it difficult to run and hide don't it?
Tell the truth to me, good truth to me
Come close to me if that's you
I wanna see the details inside those beautiful eyes
The lies

Myself ain't never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth he's searching for

No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

Just turn the lamp down
Don't talk to me
That light bulb, took something from me
Or gave something to me
I can't decide, I can't decide
Took freedom, gave purpose
Can't blend in, too perfect
All this beauty ever gave me was a reason for some beautiful lies

Myself ain't never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth he's searching for

No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is the fairest of them all
Mirror, mirror oh you're so unfair to all of the beautiful ones

No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

// She Won't Say Hello //

My best friend
What was cooler than us?
Whole school already knew what it was
Kiddy-crushing, puppy-loving, no
Ah, you are my high school wifey
College made it different
I stayed at home and you didn't
You got a scholarship to Michigan State
Drove my heart two thousand miles away

And now I sit at home, next to the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone

Can't play the same songs in my car
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her
She won't say hello, hello, hello
She won't say hello, hello, hello
Nah, nah, she won't

My best friend, wish I could have went with her
Can't afford to visit her
Let alone stay
But I wanna, I really wanna
Oh, we did everything together, now I'm missing all the silly shit
The way she bit her bottom lip after we kissed
I'm x-ing off the calendar days
I'm praying, oh, you come back again

And now I sit at home, next to the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone

Can't play the same songs in my car
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her

My baby (baby), what am I to do without her?
Whoa I've been losing patience calling her

And now I sit at home, next to the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone

Can't play the same songs in my car
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her
She won't say hello, hello, hello
She won't say hello, hello, hello
Nah, nah, she won't

// Simply //

It's simple, so simple

These hands that I pray with for just one more chance
They also took off the dress of that woman
I'm a simple man, got some simple problems
A simple, simple mistake
Simply made it so hard for you to love me

It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

My mother said, "Son, don't break her heart
And staying in love won't be so hard, it's simple."

These same lips that once said I love you, I do, I do
Admitted, they kiss her over and over and over
Simple man, couple simple problems
One simple, simple mistake
Simply made it hard for you to love me

It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

I wish I could've simply say I'm sorry, baby ooh
I wish you'd say you simply can't fall out of love with me
Then maybe we could move one ('cause I really can't)
Move on (I gotta)
Get on (I gotta)
Get on with our hearts
With ours lives, 'cause they're simply too short
Without love

It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

// So Comfortable //

I'm afraid to say it
Don't wan't you to think I'm playing
My mistakes take the pretentiousness down like I'm standing naked in a crowd
And I'm sorry I know that I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong
If I could I'd go back I'm exposed give me back my clothes 'cause I just can't take it
But look at you, loving a fool, making it easy
I guess it's cool naked with you already seen me

Oh you got me so comfortable
Even when I'm wrong, comfortable
You don't mind them flaws, you've already seen them all
Still got me feeling so comfortable
Feeling so comfortable

You keep on forgiving
Rewrote all my wrongs in pencil
When you stay it makes me forget that I'm down, now it's all so simple
'Til the end, even when, I look dumb like I do when I lie
Feels so good letting go, I'm exposed, you can have my clothes 'cause I'm not afraid
But look at you loving a fool, making it easy
I guess it's cool, naked with you already seen me

Oh you got me so comfortable
Even when I'm wrong, comfortable
You don't mind them flaws, you've already seen them all
Still got me feeling so comfortable
Feeling so comfortable

It don't matter, it don't matter no, you've seen it all before
It don't matter, it don't matter, you've seen it all before
It don't matter, it don't matter no, you've seen it all before
So comfortable, so comfortable, so comfortable

Oh you got me so comfortable
Even when I'm wrong, comfortable
You don't mind them flaws, you've already seen them all
Still got me feeling so comfortable
Feeling so comfortable

// So Fresh //

Oh no
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

So fresh (so fresh) oh yes
And I, know I was in love with you
First moment I met you, butterflies
Kept me floating in the air, that's how it felt
First word that I spoke it made you smile
'Cause I got a little style going
You laugh in my face but I didn't care
'Cause it started the conversation
That led to our first date, now
Old folks used to tell me, I know it and I felt it
I know it's true if they're just like you

So fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh
Each time when I closed my eyes
Fade in and your lips touch mine, oh
So fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh
You're like my favorite
I swear you could play forever

// Standing Still //

I'm standing by your locker
In the hallway after class
Swear I'm amazed, yeah
The drawing in my binder
Every picture I put a halo on your head

I'm on waiting on my angel
My first love
My first kiss
My second, my third
The one my momma like so much

I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still
I'm standing still, standing still
Oh, standing still

Saturdays I'm at the snow cone spot
Trying to guess your favorite flavor
I'm thinking cotton candy, maybe
I bought it and I placed it on the table next to me
I wish you could taste it
'Cause it's surely melting

I'm on waiting on my angel
My first love
My first kiss
My second, my third
The one my momma like so much

I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still

While the rain storm takes over, outrageous baby
I'll be standing here, seconds forward
I'll take it later, I'll be right there
Oh no, matter what I'll be here
However long

I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still

I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still
I'm standing still, standing still
Oh, standing still

// Stay If You Go //

My baby, my sweet pumpkin pie
My honey, my darling, my love
I only really miss him when he's gone
Cause when we're together we argue two thirds of the time
And I miss him more than a fraction when we part

Oh, oh you're calling me crazy
Saying I'm always complaining
I tell you, just leave me alone
Here you go
You're packing your things and
You're lacing your sneakers
I'm screaming get out

But don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
I say that you should leave but don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
Don't go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Sugar bunches of oats
My buttered toast on the side
My full serving of love
And then it's like
Whenever it's just me and you
You know I don't wanna fight
But I know that you know my buttons
And when to press them, baby, dammit

Oh, oh you're calling me crazy
Saying I'm always complaining
I tell you, just leave me alone
Here you go
You're packing your things and
You're lacing your sneakers
I'm screaming get out

But don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
I say that you should leave but don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
Don't go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

I told you to go
So why did you leave
I beg you to stay
I want you to go
So why did you leave
I told you to go
So why don't you stay
I begged you to stay
So why are you here
You gotta leave

Boy, you know I bet the sun won't set
Before we go at it again
It's just gon' happen
I don't understand it
My heart's sane
But my mind's going crazy

But don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
I say that you should leave but don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
Don't go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

I told you to go
So why did you leave
I beg you to stay
I want you to go
So why did you leave
I told you to go
So why don't you stay
I begged you to stay
So why are you here
I want you to leave

Oh, just go
No stay, go
Stay, go, stay, go, stay

// Surprise Ending //

I didn't notice the signs
You covered both of my eyes
(Mix-match text messages, voicemail evidence)
The audience yelling, "Damn, she's blind."
Now it's all so clear
And I was also not scared
(Now I know she missed stunt double skipped on it)
Audience kept yelling, "Not the space

(I could say that I knew the whole time) But I would be lying
(You'd have to be a hidden camera) Recording each take of crying
(I would say that I would just go to your part) To stop the taping
(But the end's here) And I can't change it

The suspense is building
Sitting on edge of my seat now
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
While the plot was thickening
I was hanging off the cliff love
You said it's a surprise! What's the surprise... ending?

You didn't notice the signs
You thought I'd just let it slide
(Guess you kept missing it Homeboys visiting)
The audience yelling, "Yeah, that's right."
And now it's not so clear
You don't know how you missed me (Gone)
Gone while you were gone
Stopped going through your phone
The audience yelling, "'Bout damn time."

(I could say that I knew the whole time) But I would be lying
(You'd have to be a hidden camera) Recording each take of crying
(I would say that I would just go to your part) To stop the taping

Sitting on edge of my seat now
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
While the plot was thickening
I was hanging off the cliff love
You said it's a surprise! What's the surprise... ending?

Everything was okay when I was the victim
Had me made out to be so naive
Never knew I was working on a masterpiece
So by the time you thought you had me, yeah
I worked on my grand finale, yeah
So now as the credits roll
You're shocked to find out how it all unfolds

The suspense is building
Sitting on edge of my seat now
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
While the plot was thickening
I was hanging off the cliff love
You said it's a surprise! What's the surprise... ending?

(Ending... Ending... No...)
You didn't notice the signs
You thought I'd just let it slide
Yeah

// The City //

Give me my power
Give me my power
Give me my power
Give me my power
I built this city

I got plenty concrete, plenty steel
Please give me my trees, give 'em back
Give me tourists, give me traffic
Give me noise, just give it back
Could you bring back all my police, give me order
Turn back on my lights, give me fuel and water
I think I'm begging, cause now that everything's gone
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine
With the streets all dark, it looks like my buildings are gone

I made you the mayor of my town honey
And I'm why you are the senate representative
I gave you the key to my city
Gave you, power over, power over me
Give it to me
Give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more

Tell the government, please give me funding
Can't you see that I'm doing bad?
Give me floodgates, give me levees
Too much water can you push it back
How you just gon' leave me out of order
I ain't got no lights and no fuel to start up
I know I'm begging, cause now that everything's dried up
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine
And with the streets all dark, the buildings look lost

I made you the mayor of my town honey
I'm why you are the senate representative
I gave you the key to my city, all power over, power over me
Give it to me, give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more

The city is mine
Now give it to me
Give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more

// Time Machine //

Get on my bike and I'mma fly through time
Until I'm with you
I promise

I'm scared
I guess I shouldn't be
But I'm a boy
In this adult body
I know I said
That we would grow old together
But I haven't
And that's cost you years

This is has been the one of my fears
That's has only ever caused you tears

So time machine, take me ahead 'til I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
She ain't living by herself
Lift off and go

I tried
With all my might, I peddled as fast as I could
Until the years just started to flicker past
Our life, oh all of it
I saw memories on both sides of the road
I pointed them out as I went along
Right there, we're making out listening to Purple Rain in the basement
And just ahead I can see your heart falling but I can't save it

This is has been the one of my fears
That's has only ever caused you tears

So time machine, take me ahead 'til I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
She ain't living by herself

I'm on my way there
To that time in space
I wish you could see, all that I see now
I'm headed towards you, yeah
I wish that time could wait
I'm on my way home

This is has been the one of my fears
That's has only ever caused you tears

So time machine, take me ahead 'til I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
She ain't living by herself
Lift off and go
Lift off and go

// Together //

Oh, we're in this together
Have a little faith
Oh, you ought to know who you are
Oh, we're all children
We're all human, we're all breathing
We're all needing, more than what they're giving
Can't you feel it?
The space of what's missing

You look up and they tell you it's a godless sky, a godless sky
So you look down
'Cause you've convinced yourself
That this is all you've got, all you've got

But picture four billion hearts beating with yours, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there's one thing about this world I know
It's that we're in it together
You're not alone, I'm not alone
If there's one thing about this world I know
We're together, we're together

I love you
And I don't know you
But I know the light in you
Is the same as in me
I trust you, like a brother
'Cause who could understand the pain
Better than someone who's going through it

You look up and they tell you it's a godless sky, a godless sky
But don't you look down
Don't you convince yourself
That this is all you've got, all you've got

Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there's one thing about this world I know
It's that we're in it together
You're not alone, I'm not alone
If there's one thing about this world I know
We're together

I've searched the souls of my people
For something to believe in
Oh, not words that I could say
But I heard them, I heard them

Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there's one thing about this world I know
It's that we're in it together
You're not alone, I'm not alone
If there's one thing about this world I know
We're together

// Tonight //

You didn't come out tonight so a man could talk to you
Just wore that dress cause you knew that we'd all be watching you
You got enough cash to buy your favorite drink too
Out with the girls for the night and us guys, you give 'em the blues

She said ooh-woo-woo you can't do nothing for me
You can't do nothing for me
That's kinda rude, but I like your attitude
"It's nothing personal"
Girl, I don't take it personal, no no
Cause deep down inside those brown eyes, I'll see you
Tonight-night, at the end of the night-night
And all fucking night-night, it's gon' be tonight-night, yeah
And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down

You see if I was another type I'da run away from you
Off to the nearest one who woulda rolled because of who I am
So tell me your name or something, she said "Is it game or something?"
"You pulling the famous card, it's cute and all but not enough"

She said ooh-woo-woo you can't do nothing for me
You can't do nothing for me
That's kinda rude, but I like your attitude
"It's nothing personal"
Girl, I don't take it personal, no no
Cause deep down inside those brown eyes, I'll see you
Tonight-night, at the end of the night-night
And all fucking night-night, it's gon' be tonight-night, yeah
I see the end of the night

And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down
And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down, oh

// Truce //

Taking turns with pressing ignore
Only to come to the conclusion
That there's no one we both love more
Back and forth, emotional tug of war
Girl I love you
But I just can't do this revolving door any longer

I'm motion sick
Oh, oh, from going in these circles
What happened, we were close
Where did we go wrong
Better yet, how do we make it right
This ain't making sense no more

Yeah, so I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I'm waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I'm calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah

Maybe it's the "me" in you that I dislike the most
Ironically, in the beginning that's what made us close
And now that's the very reason
That we're slamming doors
But we're both adults, it's time we get over it

I'm motion sick
Oh, oh, from going in these circles
What happened, we were close
Where did we go wrong
Better yet, how do we make it right
This ain't making sense no more

So I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I'm waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I'm calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah

If we stop this fighting
We can dance all night in this bitch
Be no fighting if you keep on rocking that shit
Won't be no fighting, I'ma throw the towel in
'Cause I decided, I like us way better like this

So I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I'm waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I'm calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah

// Wake Up //

Just a, just a, just a dream
Just a, just a, just a dream
Just a, just a dream

From my Lou's I'm seeing colors
Turquoise, ocean green, hurricane silver, yeah
I'm falling, down a well
Wish you were the water there
Just like a sun without a flame
Fell asleep without a dream
I saw the light fade
I let it drift away
I'm in that air and it's hard to breathe
Gravity won't hold my feet
(How'd I let my love breathe?)

I saw my life flash by the very minute
Saw my lightning, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle
Said I saw my life flash by that very instant
Saw my lighting, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle

Got to save, save me
I know you see me fall
I know you've come to die
Save, save me
My love is in the glass
My life is in that bottle
Wake up (just tell me that's it's all in my head)
Wake up (remind me that you're still in my bed)
Wake up (the thought of sleeping in my arms again)
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

I'm in Emerald City, looking for Wizard Oz
Maybe he could tell me the way
To your heart again
I click my Js three times wishing she would've stayed
And then I thought I put her on a plane
Found a diamond for your ring
The crows on Saturn, then I'm back in L.A
I woke up, she ain't there
Levitating off the mattress
Baby where you at?
I said, oh, baby where you at?

I saw my life flash by the very minute
Saw my lightning, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle
Said I saw my life flash by that very instant
Saw my lighting, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle

Got to save, save me
I know you see me fall
I know you've come to die
Save, save me
My love is in the glass
My life is in that bottle
Wake up (just tell me that's it's all in my head)
Wake up (remind me that you're still in my bed)
Wake up (the thought of sleeping in my arms again)
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

It's just a dream, that's all our love is
It's just a dream
(It's just a dream)
(My love is in that bottle)
(Save, save me)

// When I'm Done //

Sitting next to your coffee table
I'm trying to fix your cable box, again
Said you couldn't get channel four
And that's the only one you wanted to watch

Last week I was walking your dog, baby
Scrubbing your dishes
Took your clothes to the cleaners
I don't mind, cause

When I'm done
When I'm done
I'm gonna get every little bit of your love
When I'm done (I'm gonna get it)
When I'm done (You're gonna get it)
You gonna feel every little bit of my love

Making love on the coffee table
Knock all the magazines off, yeah
You spilled your wine all over the floor
But guess who had to clean it up, yeah

Last week I was washing your towels
Scrubbing your dishes
Took your clothes to the cleaners
I don't mind, cause

When I'm done
When I'm done
I'm gonna get every little bit of your love
When I'm done (I'm gonna get it)
When I'm done (You're gonna get it)
You gonna feel every little bit of my love

When I'm done
When I'm done
I'm gonna get every little bit of your love
When I'm done (I'm gonna get it)
When I'm done (You're gonna get it)
You gonna feel every little bit of my love

Well, gimme some more baby
Gimme some more
It's never enough baby
You gotta let me know
You need something, tell me something, gather something to hold
Baby I'll do it

When I'm done
When I'm done
I'm gonna get every little bit of your love
When I'm done (I'm gonna get it)
When I'm done (You're gonna get it)
You gonna feel every little bit of my love

When I'm done
When I'm done
I'm gonna get every little bit of your love
When I'm done (I'm gonna get it)
When I'm done (You're gonna get it)
You gonna feel every little bit of my love
