// Slide On Me //

See you peeping out the peep hole
Gambling with your life, nigga, Cee-Lo
Three stripes and they're all green gold
Three strikes in a row mean go
And you die slow, oh
Nigga, die slow
I screamed when I saw the titties on Janet Jackson
I'm screaming from the top of the planet
They first saw my swag, they was laughing
But my bitch bad, she leaving damage
I'm higher than a motherfucking ladder
I'm balling, I'm balling on all you scrubs
Got you riding in your foreign, you're living it up
Front's 21s and the back's on them dubs
Jeffery got a mink on, he look like a cub
Riding in the Rozay away from the world
Oasis on and I'm feeling a grudge
Oasis on when I'm seeing you girl
Oasis on and I'm seeing the dust
Oasis on and I'm feeling like water
Oasis on when I'm serving the plugs
Oasis on when I'm serving these drugs
Off white molly, I sniff it off her
All of y'all on hold on while I tangle my buzz
All white hoes putting dick in their guts
All type of hoes putting dick in their guts
Bad black hoes, they're drinking the cum
Told her when she cum I wanna drink a little some
Molly bite down, man, I need me some gum
Cop me a Sudan I'ma gon' turn up a bomb

Now when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide on peace out, yeah
That's a free slide on me, first time's on me
Next time won't be, oh, yeah, yeah

For your mentality you play ball
You run 5 on 5 least three times a week
Glen Park down the street
Waiting on you to tire
Retire with victory, play so savagely
Always fighting with them you grew up with
When you lose you don't cry but you low-key sad to see
If we cut like some champions you'll redeem yourself
You'll sleep happily, uh-ha-ha, smiling
I'm still working while you dream pop
I could never let a scene stop smiling on me
I don't think they get the point pop
They forgetting that it's me, akh
Akhi tell 'em I ain't gone, wallahi
I'm just all day running numbers
How the fuck you think I live?
Too many heads waiting for my downfall
They're like "something's gotta give"
Boys in the building give me updates like they know the weather
If you ain't in the streets you can't see the sky, I'm out here
I could see the sky and it's paradise
On the regular

Now when you slide on me, you slide on me
You slide on peace out, yeah
That's a free slide on me, first time's on me
Next time won't be, oh yeah

This is for when you change your mind and slide back this way
This is for that night when set backs won't let that much fade
Guess you can't blame the ones you choose

// 4 Tears //

Swag, swag times two

I don't cry cause I'm strong
I don't cry cause nothing lasts forever
I don't cry cause the kids are grown
I don't cry at all
I don't cry cause them days are gone
Ooh child, ooh child

But when the sun sets, just right, ooh I might
Shed a tear
And when the good word hits home
I'll shed a tear
I'll shed two tears

I won't cry in the car
I won't cry in the bathroom stall
I won't cry when I'm home alone
I won't cry at all
I won't cry cause them days are gone
Ooh child, ooh baby doll

But if the sun shines too beautiful, I might
I'll shed two tears
And when the good word hits home
I'll shed two more tears

Now that's four tears â€“ you got enough?
No more tears, you've had enough
That's four tears

// Acura Integurl (Remix) //

You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh

She's singing bitch I'm paid, that's all I gotta say, I'm like who knew?
After all the years I'd make a Weezy fan out of you too, you too, you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke, Chris Martin and U2, U2, U2
When you met me I was Three 6, Pimp C, Bun B, 8Ball and MJG, yeah

But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radios on, on

You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh

While I drive through the city, top down in the rain
I put you through it all can't fathom the pain
Them other chicks left just as fast as they came
But the love that I had for you, that will remain
Still I know how hard it is
It's kinda hard to forgive when it involves a kid
But nothing worth having comes easy so girl let's all be
If the shoe fits you should lace it
As a man I shouldn't have put you them through certain situations
But you here for the ride
My life's a roller-coaster, be prepared for the ride
I walked the clouds for you and write your name in the sky
So every time I look up you're right there in my eyes, right there in my eyes
F all them haters and them jealous chicks
I know you're my baby, don't need a DNA test to tell you this

I wrote a letter to the sky saying maybe one day you'll get to kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
My girl found it in the car and said baby why you trying to diss me, diss me, diss me
Cause you know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah

I know damn well she ride for me
It's all good, get high with me
Take everything that's stressing you and roll it up and smoke it
While them other chicks is angry, you stay happy and we love it
Take your clothes off and roll over
Lick between your legs 'til it's all over, my face
We keep going through these rumours, bitch you keep assuming
You know I love you, when trouble fumbles I keeps it moving
But I come right back cause I can't leave my baby like that
Took my heart gave it back, Santa's home here's my lap
But sometimes I'm thinking maybe she be cheating
Not my baby the sex is so addictive, I'm going crazy coming back like

You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh
You know you're my bad, you know you're my baby, ooh

// Anywhere //

Oh, girl you blow my mind every time that we're alone
Girl, let's do something new, baby tell me where you wanna go
So much opportunity, so many possibilities
I know when we be sexing 'cause you'll never know where we be sexing girl
I can't wait 'til you get off so I can put it on you
I've been thinking about you all day
You got that kind of love make a nigga wanna spend it on you
She ain't like them other girls, she ain't like them other girls
We be all up on the couch, we be all up on my dresser
We be all up in my bed, little shorty ain't scared

We just do it anywhere; we just do it anywhere,
We just do it anywhere; we just do it anywhere
In the back seat of my car, oh no, she don't mind!
We'll be all up in your office, put in that over time!
We just do it anywhere!
We just do it anywhere!
We just do it anywhere!
We just do it anywhere!

// Back //

The love glows, I know the love glows
Oh I know the love glows, I know the love glows
Yeah

If we colored our white walls pitch black
Turn all the lights off and lay back
We can make love with our bare hands
We can make light out of thin air
Or we can close our eyes and sleep well
Dreams feel realer than right now
But whatever you do don't let go
My only nightmare is waking up alone
In a world where you're not mine
And the room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I stare into your eyes, I see my real life
That's why I never sleep with my back to you

When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you

Laying under the covers that I stole
From your side of the bed cause I got cold
You rolled over and whispered ro-robbery
So you been sleeping with a thief in your bed
Stole your heart and your pillows
Whatever you do just don't go
Baby, the worst jail is
Waking up alone in a world where you're not mine
In a room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I'm looking in you eyes, I see my real life
So I never sleep with my back to you

When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you

Like a nightlight
Like a teddy bear
Like a toddler's blanket
Look at us baby, two grownups acting like children
Ooooooo, yeah

When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don't think I'd notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you

// Bend Ya //

All the spoons in my kitchen
(Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
(They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
(Bend, I bend, I bend, I bend)
Bend it girl, bend it girl

Uh, soon as I enter
I put a hurting on it if I don't kill it she injured
For a long time, summer, spring and winter
Fall for anything, you clumsy ass nigga
Jumping off the boat in some eighty-seven locs
She's seen them hundred spokes, and then that woman spoke
But I don't talk back, I put my life on tracks
If that don't work put your wife on track
Show me where the candle wax, it must be you
Because I burn right through everything y'all do
High octane when I bring on my last name
Mr. Lamar a.k.a "The Cash King"
Quicker than pre-cum won't you give her a reason
To not meet/meat up with me like a vegan
Psssh! God Damn I'm the fucking man
She said fuck her man, now she fuck with man

All the spoons in my kitchen
(Bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya up, and bend ya back down
All the girls in my bedroom
(They bend, they bend, they bend, they bend, they bend)
Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I
(Bend, I bend, I bend, I bend)
Bend it girl, bend it girl

What goes, alright, like like
Life goes in cycles
Everything that comes around goes around
'Fore it goes down, get you some ice

Life goes in cycles, what comes around goes around
So 'fore it goes down, nigga, get you some icicles
Audemars before all of y'alls
Wristwatch got a Russian face like an oligarch, uh
12 o'clock, boy, silly nice, huh
Willie in traffic, I'm Philly nice, uh
E.T. on the handles, uh
Handlebars like a Xanax
Shammgod with the AND1 moves
Throw that shit 'round your neck
Right quick, broke boys get fixed
Right quick, Nigel Sylvester with these bike flips
Uh, that's a full cab and a back flip
Uh, sidebar

Arm stretch a tee like I nailed it
Raf moving slow like a creep
Shirt in the breeze like I'm sailing
And I walk in my sleep, I can't help that (I can't)
When's the last time I asked for some help that
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?
I couldn't get from nobody out there (I can't)
When's the last time I asked for some help that
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?
Nobody

I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
Open the sky, get a handful
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fucking with cash?
God gave you what you could handle
Gave you what you could handle
I got the grip like the handle
And I'm biking
I'm biking with me and my Daniel
Hades got the angels
TV's got the angles
I'm braking... got

Biking, I'm biking, I'm biking slow-mo
Maybe the four wheel exciting us mo'
I'm cold when the temperatures dip below 70s
How can I be burr around L.A. coast?
The diamonds is plural, the Tiffany brooch
On my lapel, at the table, I'm giving a toast
The first wedding that I've been in my twenties
Thinking maybe someone is not something to own
Maybe the government got nothing to do with it
Thinking maybe the feeling just comes and it goes
Think I want me a little one that look like my clone
Me and my baby can't do on our own
I landed a trick, got my impossibles
I'm fucking with Addy, I'm watching my dose
24 hours like they never close
I'm biking, I'm biking, I'm biking these blocks, yeah
Since Ben Baller sold all his ice up at Slauson, ooh
I'm biking uphill and it's burning my quads (Obstacles)
I'm biking downhill and it sound like a fishing rod
Savage, I'm biking, yeah

From Coldwater to the Shaw
Alcoholic way I handle the bars
This a PK, PK Ripper
Nah, you can't fuck with the boy
That's my problem, yeah, I got 'em
My tire smoking when I stop
Okay, nobody fucking with me
My accolades hang from my neck
Pedal, I drown in the heat
My sapphires drown in my sweat
White mags, but I jet
Jackson, I'm saving the streets
I'm Roger Rabbit in the air
I don't care, Big Willie Style, yeah
Nigga one wheel, one wheel, one wheel
Nigga one wheel, I fishtail downhill, yeah
I rose my rate, brand new brakes
Why I name it Slater? Ask my date

I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
Open the sky, get a handful
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fucking with cash?

Ashes and remnants of ballers
Body that's gutted
A Bentley that used to be flawless
I'm high up, the raindrops keep falling
Scattered, the showers
Don't scaffold the towers
I'm up, mom, I promise
In class with the honors
No cheat like I'm honest
And how did I become so accomplished?
'Cause I don't see foes
I just see a code
I just see a hole
Chinks in your armor

// Blue Whale //

Tropical vibe, coconut milk and shaved ice
My soul glow with the low cut, no jheri curl, Jerry Rice
Boogie board on the rip tide
Parasail and deep dive, won't think twice
Your little baby bone boy killing me
Swearing he's grown when he got that steel
But he ain't swam with that blue whale
I ain't swam with that ho neither, Earl said that world real
Sit back and watch the water, hope the monster don't wag his tail
And send that big wave over while I'm showing off my pirate grill
To the baddies walking by me, showing skin because it's nothing
My little brother serving molly 'cause that bill due Monday
And my passport's buried and my home town flooded
With just a little bit of water, but my shoes still muddy
And if I ever have a daughter, I wonder what I could call her?
Nine months after I fuck on the beach, I guess I call her Karma
Copped a jet ski with the booster seat, I'm kidding but I'm balling
Just playing but I'm serious, I'm witted and I'm wilding

This life goes on, man, that's one thing about it
This life goes on, dawg, that's one thing about it
I'm feeling what you're saying, you're trying to get around it
But life goes on, pimping, the wise don't doubt it

Stuck in the sky, first time upside down on the whole ride
And I wasn't much into the type that my bros like
So I never really had no wife and that's alright
"Black woman ain't got no man," that's what she said to me
Yeah she did, that you can date outside your race, I mean
I ain't supposed to show my love
Judge gotta like my case, I mean
Somebody please switch my plates, ship my car to Rome
5K on the wheels, still ain't riding chrome
Backpack rapper skills, veteran nigga deal
So let irrelevant nigga do what irrelevant nigga feel
Let a regular nigga judge
Because his gavel fake and he regular, still
How that gravel taste? How you paid your medical bill?
Sands white on my tan feet, Colosseum in the back seat
Straw hut where the beach be
Like screen saver when your Mac sleep
Relaxing, I ain't racing no fucking rats, I'm relaxing
And if it's wrong to ya

Well, life goes on, brother, that's one thing about it
Life goes on, my nigga, one thing about it
I'm saying what you're seeing, we trying to talk around it
But life goes on, pimping, the wise don't doubt it

// Cayendo //

No hablarÃ¡ de mÃ­, ni hablarÃ¡ de esto
Lo que Ã©l quiere de ti, yo no se lo negarÃ­a
Si esto no me ha partÃ­o', ya no me partirÃ© nunca
Si puedo soportar lo que siento, Â¿Por quÃ© me estoy cayendo?

You stood me up, you laid me down
You know too much, I can't be proud
I still really, really love you, yes, I do
When I still really, really love you, like I do
If you won't, then I will
If you can't, then I will
Is it love to keep it from you?

No hablarÃ¡ de mÃ­, ni hablarÃ¡ de esto
Lo que Ã©l quiere de ti, yo no se lo negarÃ­a
Si esto no me ha partÃ­o', ya no me partirÃ© nunca
Si puedo soportar lo que siento, Â¿Por quÃ© me estoy cayendo?

Â¿Acaso voy cayendo?
You stood me up, you lay me down
You know too much (Too much), I can't be proud
I still really, really love you, yes, I do

// Chanel //

My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he twelve
How you looking up to me and talking down? (Yeah)
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the I am (Whoa)
Now film it with that drone cam, in the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, NoÃ©, up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back, yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rolling when you ride, popping
Rolling when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight acting
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016: burnt some discs (Dope)
2017: ideas playing off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, "issa knife" (Knife)
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting (Fighting)
Revenge in the air makes my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick (Pow)
Clips on clips like Mikey (Hello)
It's really all

I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind

V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it driving itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

I see both sides like Chanel
I see both sides like Chanel

My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they're all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazing the dash, counting money at home
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they're all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazing the dash, counting money at home

// Chanel (Remix) //

My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a nigga like he 12
How you looking up to me and talking down?
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the "I Am" (Whoa)
Now film it with that drone cam
In the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, NoÃ©
Up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back
Yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rolling when you ride, popping
Rolling when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight acting
Turned out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016, burnt some discs
2017, ideas playing off a Walkman
This a cult not a clique, on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, "Issa knife" (Knife)
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting (Fighting')
Revenge in the air makes my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick (Yeah)
Clips on clips like Mike
It's really all

I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind

V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by their selves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it driving itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

My pockets snug
They can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa
My Amex and Mastercards
I got new money
And it's all cash
I got new bags
And they're all collabs
I rubber-band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards (I mean my baby bi)
Amazing the cash online unknown (I mean my baby bi)
Blazing the dash counting money at home
My pockets snug
They can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa
My Amex and Mastercards
I got new money
And it's all cash
I got new bags
And they're all collabs
I rubber-band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards (I mean my baby bi)
Amazing the cash online unknown (I mean my baby bi)
Blazing the dash counting money at home

I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld

I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld

Our lives are factual and actual
Plus you natural and match well
Burdens on my back look like a shell
Purple act, I'm moving like a snail
Both sides even like equal
Both eyes gleaning like a scale
Green and blue, hundreds turning teal
Green and blue, money colored tales
Was such a good guy to Chanel
'Til she caught me sleeping with Charel
The Range, Royce, ring, like Pharrell
Bling so she see that I'm for real
Picture me, a fire burn in Hell
Photography like David LaChapelle
Black lapels and nappy ponytail
Make 'em call me Flacko Lagerfeld

I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld

// Dreamkilla //

A dream dream dream
Dream dream dream
Killer killer

You said I'd never make it well I'm here
You told me I should go and sleep off the dreams
You promised I would stop having nightmares
If I could do my best to just not believe

Say I'm infatuated with my future
Too in love with tomorrow
And that tomorrow's a mystery that won't be solved
Tomorrow's a rolling stone that won't be home

Never dream that you tell me lies, lies, lies
Vicious lies looking me in my eyes, lies, lies
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me
I'm running, I'm running, dream killer, dream killer killer

Villain with a dagger was chasing me
I woke up and you were standing right there
You kissed me and said that's just a bad one babe
Then I asked you what's that in your hand

You told me I'm infatuated with my future
Too in love with tomorrow
You say tomorrow's a mystery that won't be solved
Tomorrow's a rolling stone that won't be home

Never dream that you tell me lies, lies, lies
Vicious lies looking me in my eyes, lies, lies
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me
I'm running, I'm running, dream killer, dream killer killer

I'm gon' sleep good as soon as you're gone
But I can't dream good as long as long as

I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me
I'm running, I'm running, dream killer, dream killer killer

Dream killer, dream killer killer

// Eyes Like Sky //

Hell yeah
A blind boy sees a green girl
She drives a green car through a dream world
She meets up with a green club
And talks of saving the earth from itself
A blind boy saw a blue man
Who rides a blue bus through a nightmare
He leaves word to a blue home
But the blue seems different since she's passed away

And the same boy with sunken eyes saw me
And described yellow so perfectly

Said he's watching
Watching
Watching
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen

A blind boy became a kind man
Who painted white lights on a canvas
He once said he didn't write songs
Cause making music would be selfish
And back then he saw the flags fly
Seen them fight and divide for it
He said war is for those who foresee it
But what good is border to me yeah, yeah

And the same man with sunken eyes saw me
And described yellow so perfectly

Said he's watching
Watching
Watching
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen

I said, "I wish you could see the ocean."
He said, "I wish you could see hope."
I said, "Have you ever seen the mountain?"
He said, "No, but my faith could move those."
Oh whoa
I said, "I wish you could see the stars."
He told me I should see love
Love
Oh yeah

Said he's watching
Watching
Watching
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen

// Girlfriend's Best Friend //

It's 2 AM
Got a call
From a girl

She heard a noise
Got a little scared

She hates sleeping alone
But still you ain't home
So since you're nowhere to be found
Don't trip bro I'ma hold her down

I'm your girlfriend's best friend
Soon I'll be taking over

Soon-soon I'll be taking your spot

Now I'm not hating
On your situation
But all I'm saying
These chicks are crazy
You've got a good girl

It's gonna take you losing her
For you to know what you really had
On the spotlight, warming her bed
But as soon as you drop the ball
I'll be ready to pick up where you left off

I'm your girlfriend's best friend
Soon I'll be taking over
I'm your girlfriend's best friend

And it ain't a pretty picture by no means

I'm 'a just sit here and wait my turn

I'm your girlfriend's best friend
Soon I'll be taking over
I'm your girlfriend's best friend

// Godspeed (dvsn remix) //

I will always love you how I do
Let go of a prayer for ya
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you

Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Oh-oh-oh)
Still I'll always be there for you
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I do
I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home, always

God has my soul but you have my heart
Will string to the end, that's where we'll start
And it's a long way, you're lost
I lose myself, I found you
You're like kinda like I found you
Could you use that if I can't guide you
That to me, I'll be

Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Oh-oh-oh)
Still I'll always be there for you
(Oh-oh-oh)
How I do
I let go of my claim on you, it's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home, always

This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
Until it's time
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
It's 'til it's time we die
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind

Oh-oh, oh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh-oh, oh

// Hero //

My flag is American, but I love some queen
I'm young enough to vote, and toke the trees
I'll be playing concerts in the mud, until the sequel
I'll be finding subjects to paint in the buff, behind the easel
Tryna fuck, I'm a bad boy
I'm a punk, I'm a black man, I could dunk

And I'm hanging low, and I'm swinging far
Home, home

What you say
You need a hero
Heard 'em say
You need a save, hey

How high, tell me how high shall we jump
How far, really how far have we come
I've been wondering if we'd be better off without it
I was wondering were we better off before

Who needs you? Who needs you?
Who loves you? Who doesn't?
What you say
You need a save, hey

// I Can Escape //

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
I see your eyes, eyes fall
You don't wanna cry
You keep your eyes closed
I could be great, I'm on my way
I want escape, I can escape
Uh, I could be great, I'm on my way
If I want escape, I can escape
Uh, I could be great, I'm on my way
If I want escape, I could escape
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm
I see your eyes, I see your eyes fall
You don't wanna cry so, you keep your eyes closed
I could be great, I'm on my way
If I want escape, I can escape
I could be great, I'm on my way
If I want escape, I can escape
Uh, comin' out fadin', telephone gauge
I had an M5, headlights, I spotted the keys
Race on a date, race and sedate
I know you lie, you just don't lie to my face
I keep it graceful, I-I can escape, huh, huh
Comin' out fadin', telephone gauge
Had an M5, headlights, I spotted the jakes
Race on a date, race and sedate
I know you lie, you just don't lie to my face
An' I could be great

How was that?
Oh, it's fire? Cool, cool
Yeah

I saw your eyes, I saw your eyes fall
You don't wanna cry, so you kept your eyes closed
I could be great, I'm on my way
If I wanna escape, I can escape
Uh, we was on a date
I took you to Met, kisses, outside your favorite
I don't like fried chicken, I don't want no Chick-fil-A
And I don't even rob, niggas, can't do that job through the day
Comin' out fake, turn off engage
I had the M5 when the headlights was spotted out the jakes
Race on a date, race and sedate
I know you lie to me, you just don't lie to my face
I can be great, so I'm grateful for it
You just wanna hate, you gotta give for it
You don't wanna fight, you ain't built for that, uh?
That roll call, you can see my hands
Jaws gon' break, lip gon' bust, you like
I snuck up on me and ain't say nothin'
Bit until my tongue gushes, I couldn't say that
Huh, I ain't say nothin'
I ain't say nothin', uh, uh
I say nothin', mm, I say nothin'
What you dream for? Dream for, mm

Used to play tough with the cops, had ideas (Go, go)
Through the protests, hold me in spot, and I'll go
Black folk know what talkin' white mean, but still
Hold two open hands up in the sky, finger quotes
In my gang, the youth, my lames used to smell like Polo tees
Mazel tov toss him a bottle, like what Puff did to Steve
You can't tote your own weight, then what's this bullshit even 'bout?
Crystals on your lil' feet, that's all that dust protein
Swoop Tremaine from Calabasas
In a Brit sports car
We used to cypher in Marc Jacobs
Had the library card
At Scott's comparing the silver spoons
To plastic knives and sporks
I was the dog breathless chasing the car up the street
If I ever catch it I'll panic
That's the flaw in me
And nothing glamorous about growing
Up Poor and naive
Standing on the balls of my feet
Trying to pray before I sleep

Go ahead red light, standing at the waterfront district
Now my head on a cushion
Like pink, I'm revvin', like green, I'm swimmin'
Someone like you, someone like me, ring finger, might sure get took it
Wrist like springs, natural springs, waterin' head, no cookie
Other than me and you, and nobody else comin' between a cool star
We got the camera on Monday
We made a movie on Tuesday, fuck
We got to look, to look, we never seen stars, it looks so bright

Damn, I try to sleep, can't get a lot, made dreams bleed into days
The pressure couldn't stop the bleeding, I started seeing things
Watching out for demons
Blocking out them like to screen these plays
I was always reading ya
There's some heaven where the sun don't shine
And I started feeling like pussy poppin was the paradigm
Get my dick wet, maritime
I'm immersified
All my friends in smoke, smoke blazing, trail behind
Or he rose in front of mine
It's rappers who evolve with time
Reductive in all the rhymes
But that time they enforce the biased
You know, it's some cops stop and frisk the guy
'Cause he brown so of course he sized
And all the gangs these lames it's extorted by
Switch lanes in the Porsche I driving
That the police Ford Explorer by
Sirens screaming like they four or five
Throwing tantrums on the 405
So I don't wait, like I'm tryna gain
Don't hibernate in the winter
That's where summer bodies are made
Just leg days like a sprinter
With the brown, baby blue interior
Big Bs like GMOs
And they sting on my eyes closed
All I see with my eyes closed
Blame my emo on time zones
It's the same but different sets of twins, siblings
Experience excesses

Go ahead red light, standing at the waterfront district
Now my head on a cushion
Like pink, I'm revvin', like green, I'm swimmin'
Someone like you, someone like me, ring finger, might sure get took it
Wrist like springs, natural springs, waterin' head, no cookie
Other than me and you and nobody else comin' between a cool star
We got the camera on Monday
We made a movie on Tuesday, fuck
We got the look, good looks, ain't never seen stars that look so bright

Prayin' mantis, flipped by the asian's first fall of rain, big Pharrell prayin' hand
Big P, big P, bust our face, keep up those alien hands
I wanna see the money in cash so that I could truly grasp
Makin' a save, they got that a favor, big for a prayin' hands

Big P, big P, big P, big P
Yeah, huh, big P
Speakin' of God, at ten years old, I switched church homes
Speakin' of God, speakin' of God, speakin' of God
Yeah, hmm
Don't wanna talk me off the ledge, mmm
Gotta get in my, mmm
Gotta get in my own head
Ooh, yeah
You can go there, yeah
Whenever you feel like it, duh, nuh, huh, nuh
Mm, the first, though, maybe keep it in four, though
Uh-huh

Speakin' of God, at ten years old, I switched church homes
The bishop was tweakin', and we was Baptist
So how you a bishop? Like, technically speakin'
You drove a white Rolls, me and my family was tight, bros
Difference between havin' a home and not havin' a home is a tightrope
Vistin' Catholic churches, the pastor was quiet as mice, so
Minister spoke on a microphone
They had no choir, so silent, I thought I heard Christ, cold
Need a messiah, run out the house from home while she's seven months pregnant with Ryan
I figured I'd go to the East with my team for some peace and quiet
I ended up runnin the streets with my cousin sittin' in the back
Listenin' to beats, schemin' on schemes that can't even pass
It's strategy, murder your cells, I'm far according to stats
I pray that the plots clearin', thick, it's bulletproof glass
So much where the death is, the visions of days
You keep speakin' of death, it starts to seem' like a new car you're gonna buy
Starts poppin' up on your way to work
You see it all the time, always passin' by
Call it plan Beetle, Bug, yeah, it's on sight, better throw a punch
Runnin' late to Teterboro, made the plane wait 'cause there's no rush
Calls for no one oceans from above, kinda look like bubbles on the tub
Kinda like mmm

// I Need It //

One winter morning I went for a drive
I stopped somewhere between June and July
I love these warmer days
But maybe I can't see that the snow's still falling
I only see the gift my heart just brought me
(Merry Christmas babe) That's what she said
She didn't have to do much, but she made me smile
December in Manhattan feels like South Beach now
I love my baby, oh yes I do

It ain't about you giving anything, as long as you're my everything
Cause lady what could you give to me better than what you've been giving me
Just keep talking in my ear, cause I need it
And tell me you'll be right here if I need ya
The greatest present you could give is the present (oh, I need it)

It's just a regular morning, I'm a regular guy
Taking the train to my 9 to 9
(But something's different today)
I had an envelope sitting right next to my breakfast
And it's from my baby, not the bill collectors
(Happy Birthday Baby)
Then it said... I know we don't got much but baby we got us
And after you get off, we gon' make sweet love
Now go and get that cake (oh yeah)

It ain't about you giving anything, as long as you're my everything
Cause lady what could you give to me better than what you've been giving me
Just keep talking in my ear, cause I need it
And tell me you'll be right here if I need ya
The greatest present you could give is the present (oh, I need it)

One day the whole world will hear me sing
Then I'mma run and buy you those things
But right now, three months pay barely gets me a diamond baby
But one day I'mma buy you that ring
Oh

Just keep talking in my ear, cause I need it
And tell me you'll be right there if I need ya
The greatest present you could give is the present (oh, I need it)

(Nothing but everything)
(I don't need anything, long as you're my everything)

// In My Room //

No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
You ain't stingy, split your tablets with me
You won't flinch when camera's flashing, flashing
Not fake laid back, no, it's natural
And I think you made for the life I lead
I'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick, huh
That kinda coffin don't need lean
Rest in peace
Got this lust for life in me, yeah
Horny for the game, uh
First they kiss, then they bite soft, uh
Then that bitch wanna play it off, huh
Fuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
While serpents shake some brand new scales
I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos
Acting familiar, took all the rock
And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful, they don't say thank you
They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill
It's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel
Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel
Rocket

Quit being violent with me
Quit being violent with me
Quit being violent with me
You make me violent

My room, my room, my room with me
Every night you were in my room
My room, my room with me
I guess I can't state my feelings too soon
I don't know you
And I can't put no threats in the air

// Lens //

My girl made him wait 'til the hours of the night
Then hit you with the, "You know it's mid, right?"
Can't be on time for the free rides
Can't be my type, I'm a low life
Crammed in some time, now I'm your whole life
Can't make those calls in the low light
Are you ready to go? We gon' be waiting in line
Yeah, you look good, would I fuck? Yeah
Did I? Almost
Back home with that, almost
Back home with that, next time
Bags with all that Rally's in 'em
Trades with all the valley
Top chopped down like blades came through the valley

// Let Me //

I don't know if I ever told you this before, before
But you're the only one I ever waited for this long
And now the room is crowded, right now
So tell me are you about it, right now?

I've been thinking of you all the time
There's been various issues, but would you let me, let me tonight?

Got all them couples floating on your pink champagne
You know there's bottle service, bottle service, babe
Long as the DJ's playing all these raunchy songs
Girl, we can do this on the dance floor all night long
Now I know the room is crowded, right now
But tell me are you about it right now?

I've been thinking of you all the time
There's various issues, but would you let me, let me tonight?
See, I've been dreaming of you in the daytime
And it ain't right, so would you let me, let me tonight?

Now listen, don't you get this twisted girl
If I leave you, without you, I miss you girl
And if I had you right now, I wouldn't change a thing
You tell me this ain't what you're used to
But baby can't no man judge you
I can tell ain't no man loving you
I can tell ain't no man loving you

// Memrise //

Memorize
Memorize
Memorize
Memorize
Memorize
Memorize
Memorize
Memorize
Memorize

I memorized the wayward expressions
Never look down
Never let you see me down
I memorized the way no directions
Can I come over now
I'd like to stay a little while
I memorized your body exposed
I can fuck you all night long
From a memory alone

I never forget a face
Don't go plastic on me
Nothing's set in stone
You're not dipped in gold
Dipped in gold
You can't breathe if you're dipped in gold
You are not on paper
You are not a copy
You're so, you're so so thick, so thick

// Moon River //

One, two

Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday
A dream maker (Maker)
My heart (You heart) breaker
Wherever you're going, I'm going that way (The same)

Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a crazy world to see
We're all chasing after all the same
Chasing after our ends

Moon river, wider than a mile
Crossing in style someday
My dream maker, heart breaker
Wherever you're going, I'm going the same

Two drifters off to see the world
It's such a crazy world you'll see
What I see, who I become
What I see, who I become
We're all chasing after our ends
Chasing after our ends

Life's just around the bend, my friend
Moon river and me

// Orion //

I remember being immortal
I though that I was
I wanted to conquer the world
Before I could drive

I remember when you were born
Oh, how happy I was
'Cause if it didn't go as I planned it
At least you'd double my chances

And it's no pressure, man
'Cause you're special
I know you wanna get big and strong quick
But don't skip one second (Orion)

If I could buy back the years
O-O-Orion
I would empty my pockets here (On everything)
O-Orion
Make my regrets disappear
O-O-Orion
Boy I'm jealous of you I'll admit it
But promise big bro one thing
That you won't go wasting time
(O) Won't go wasting time
(No) That you won't go wasting time
(O) Won't go wasting time
(No) Don't go wasting it

You gotta know you hit the lotto (lotto)
'Cause they don't make 'em like mamma no more
Hug her and tell her that you love her
That's good time spent

And when you're outside running
It's OK to ask where you're going
So that you're never back where you started
Wondering where time went

And it's no pressure, man
'Cause you're special
I know you wanna get big and strong quick
But don't skip one second (Orion)

If I could buy back the years
O-O-Orion
I would empty my pockets here (On everything)
O-Orion
Make my regrets disappear
O-O-Orion
Boy, I'm jealous of you I'll admit it
But promise big bro one thing
That you won't go wasting time
O-O-Orion
I would empty my pockets here (On everything)
O-Orion
To make my regrets disappear
O-O-Orion
Boy I'm jealous of you wiling there
But promise big bro one thing
That you won't go wasting time
(O) Won't go wasting time
(No) That you won't go wasting time
(O) Won't go wasting time
(No) Don't go wasting it

// Paradise //

Trying to find, trying to find the words to say
To show you how I don't want to spend another day without you
The words get lost they all seem to disappear
The thoughts are stuck paralyzed by this love that's here to stay

Tell me, tell me why
You're so damn good to me
It's where I start over-thinking
So is it right for me to say
You are my love
You are my love

More then fast it feels like infinity
I feeling soft ballets and symphonies
If only you could look from where I can see
See my vision on the life between me and you

Tell me, tell me why
You're so damn good to me
It's where I start over-thinking
So is it right for me to say
You are my love
You are my love

// PDA //

Intimate scenes, fresh from my dreams
Of a triple X movie scene
I could care less about being seen
A higher self-esteem if you on me
(Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?)
I say baby do you think
Sugar's so sweet, it'll rot my teeth
But instead it just rottens me, yeah
Spoiled crazy

Public display of affection (Got 'em hating)
Pointing in our direction (Watch 'em watch 'em)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way
We be at the club, the restaurant
The grocery store or the movie
Kissing and touching with my hands all over ya booty
Wherever it is, we is, I'll love it truly
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A

Remember at the beach, we brought the sheets
And were harassed by police
Good thing we didn't go too deep
Everywhere we meet, the passion in me just screams
I just need you in my reach
Baby your suspense, you being tense
Has got me convinced
You're the fingers to my instrument

Public display of affection (Got 'em hating)
Pointing in our direction (Watch 'em watch 'em)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way
We be at the club, the restaurant
The grocery store or the movie
Kissing and touching with my hands all over ya booty
Wherever it is, we is, I'll love it truly
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A

From the lobby to the patio (Boy you're so crazy)
And we so compatible
From the Starbucks to the Navajo (You nasty)
And we so compatible

The club, the restaurant
The grocery store or the movie
Kissing and touching with my hands all over ya booty
Wherever it is, yes, I'll love it truly
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A

Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)

// Pink Matter (Remix) //

Remix
And the peaches and the mangoes that you could sell for me

What do you think my brain is made for?
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, "What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?"
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure
Oh, nah, nah

What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet, then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure over matter

(Hey, hey) Yeah
Doesn't matter if she wanna be with me, so it's cool
I make her call me B. B. King because I give her the blues
But not on purpose though, she was the perfect hostess
When I come over, we would do the grossest
Most beautifulest things on a bed of roses
Would be the coldest when you hit the hardwood floor
We sipping 'gnac, not mimosas
She's in my naked lap, going HAM like she's supposed to
And she could make it clap if I told her
Or make her ass spread like the back of a cobra
Standing at attention like a soldier
A G.I. Joe, man, see, me, I go in (Ask a bitch, nigga)
Yeah, that nigga goes up in it
Like smoke through a chimney (Hey, hey)
Slow stroke, 'cause she feeling me up in her, nigga
Killing me softly, raw dog, she wants me
Strong and black like her coffee, get off me
Act a donkey, I pin her tail to the mattress
I've been a player, make her go from classy to nasty
Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty (Ha, ha, ha)
To sloosh (Hey, hey)

Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, "Naw
She better with some fella with a regular job."
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner, Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Hops into my car, drove far
Far's too close and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I? Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modeling, thick girls are made for cuddling
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands

Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter

You're good at being bad (Yep)
You're bad at being good (Oh)
For Heaven's sakes, go to Hell
Knoâ€”knock on wood, hey
You're good at being bad (You're bad at being good)
You're bad at being good
(For Heaven's sakes, go to Hell, knock on wood)
For Heaven's sakes, go to Hell
Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
Well frankly when that ocean so motherfucking good
Make her swab the motherfucking wood
Make her walk the motherfucking plank
Make her rob a motherfucking bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver

Yeah my best friend ain't backing out, it's still on sight, fool

Babe, just say you miss me, is it that hard?
Too long since I've heard about our love
Am I in this by myself? Hey yeah
With rose colored lenses on my store bought frames
To see something other than these blues and grays
I need something different, hey yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause you ain't feeling the same

Who knows, maybe I'm crazy, that's one big maybe
But even a fool knows when it's gold, gold, gold
I know pyrite from 24 karat, yeah
Cubic's from genuine diamond, yeah
A call from the woman who loves you and hello from a friend
I know when it's real, I know how to tell
I know the difference between what you say and how you feel
Oh, oh I know when it's real

Oh, I can tell the difference every time that you call
But I don't need a drink I need some time in my car
Time to drive and think, time to park and cry
You shoulda known you were beautiful
You shoulda known what I saw in you, yeah
Please forgive me for feeling like it's all your fault
A heavy heart can't carry blame for the loss

Who knows, maybe I'm crazy, that's one big maybe
But even a fool knows when it's gold, gold, gold
I know pyrite from 24 karat, yeah
Cubic's from genuine diamond, yeah

I know when it's real, I know how to tell
I know the difference between what you say and how you feel
Oh, oh I know when it's real

You might not know this but I'm a man with pride
And this hurts me baby deep down, deep down
I can't let go of this, gotta know I tried
It's pathetic baby don't lie, don't lie
I'm a candle, you're the sun
And you're burning baby, you're burning baby
Burning up, burning up
Burning up, burning up, burning up, yeah

Pyrite from 24 karat yeah

And hello from a friend

Darker times
They're telling boulder-heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
(Voodoo)
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
(Voodoo)
Don't let him see divide
Don't you let her see divide
(Voodoo)

She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands, in his hands

I'm out in front of Supreme, like I own it
Buttercream Benz, goldfinger wheels
Driver can't steer, but look like Pam Grier
She like "Where's there parking around here"
That spots reserved, so are those right there
Reserved for who?
For pretty girls in sports cars

Pretty girl driving my sports car
'Cause my license been suspended
Pretty girl driving my sports car
Got my feet up on the wood grain, roof missing

You've got that whip appeal
Whipping my stick, shift, gear
You'd be under the jail, girl
Only if whipping could kill

Up and down Mulholland, on the weekends we chill
You're driving with no shoes â€“ cruise control
Love the way you take the wheel
Got your photo on my air freshener
In a sense just like the

Pretty girl driving my sports car
'Cause my license been suspended
Pretty girl driving my sports car
Got my feet up on the wood grain, roof missing

You've got that whip appeal
Whipping my stick, shift, gear
You'd be under the jail, girl
Only if whipping could kill

I just finished practice
She's on her way to get me, she's in traffic
She said give her 20 minutes (I'm finna hop in the shower)
Girl I hope 20 don't mean an hour
And as the cold water runs over my chest
I've been thinking 'bout your skirt on my head rest

Pretty girl driving my sports car
Pretty, roof missing

You've got that whip appeal
Whipping my stick, shift, gear
You'd be under the jail, girl
Only if whipping could kill

You've got that whip appeal
Whipping my stick, shift, gear
You'd be under the jail, girl
Only if whipping could kill

I let you drive my Benz
Flossing all your friends around town
I let you fill my seats with shopping bags
I let you go do your thing riding with your friends 'round town
Riding with your girlfriends
And I always keep it clean
So why don't you park in the front just to stunt
That'll make all them bitches mad
Why don't you lift up the roof just to stunt
It'll make all them bitches mad
All them girls wanna be you

You've got that whip appeal
Whipping my stick, shift, gear
You'd be under the jail, girl
Only if whipping could kill

When I look out my window there's trees talking like people

I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
I've dreamt of gravity keeping us around
I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely and it was silent

What is this love, I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is, could be given a name
I woke you were there, tracing planets on my forehead

But I'll forget 23 like I forget 17
And I forget my first love, like you forget a day dream
And what of all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
Well I'll fade to grey soon on the TV station

// Wiseman //

Wiseman closes mouth
Madman closes fist
Young man shows his age
Judge man named it sin
Bad man don' exist no
No evil man exists
Good man don't exist no
No righteous man exists
Sad man cannot cry in place where man can see
Never witnessed father weep
This old man thought it weak
But strong man don't exist
No undying man exists
Weak man don't exist no
Just flesh and blood exists
But your mother would be proud of you
I bet your mother would be proud of you

The beast will crawl this earth
Then fall in the dirt to feed the crows
They'll rip apart his flesh
'Til all that's left is glorious bone
So you'll bury your own
Too vain
You saw it unfold
What you know
And you claimed all you could hold
Until death did you part from the mess you made
I bet your mother would be proud of you
I bet your mother would be proud of you

Primate sharpens tool
To survive and thrive in the jungle
Maybe hearts were made to pump blood
Maybe lungs were made for flood
I won't blunt my blade for cut these chains
Rather let my limbs be dragged through mud
You're my brother but your eyes are cold
You're my sister but your womb is bare

I bet our mother would be proud of you
I bet our mother would be proud of you

Bad man don't exist
No evil man exists
I know good man don't exist
No righteous man exists
Strong man don't exist
No undying man exists
Weak man don't exist
No just flesh and blood exists

// You Are Luhh //

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
If you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love

When you feel what you feel
It's hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel more like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about

But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love

(Wait, waiting)
Let me know
You niggas going in
Tell me what it is (Fuck it)
What it is, no need to make believe
Look beyond your world
Try to find, find a place for me

'Cause when you're at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, know
Love

Stay at your best, baby
Let me know, let me know
