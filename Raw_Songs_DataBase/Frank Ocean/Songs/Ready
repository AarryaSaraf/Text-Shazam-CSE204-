Oh, oh, oh, baby
I know I've been gone
I know it's been so long
And girl, I hope you miss me
'cause you know I've been missing ya baby, missing my baby
Yeah we talk on the phone every day
But that just don't do it for me
I need you around yeah
I can't do without you
Shorty, my plane just now touched down
I'mma send a car to come get you from your house
So be ready in an hour
Just be ready

We only got one night the suns gon' be setting in a while
(Be ready, be ready)
We still got moonlight I'm down for whatever right now
(Be ready, be ready)
Oh when the sky starts, sky starts changing
Sweet love we'll be making, oh
Just tell me
(You ready, you ready?)

Open up the door
Girl you got me thrown off
'cause when you came to kiss me yeah
Can you feel my heart beating, oh
Look into your eyes pretty hazel-brown
If you only knew what I'm thinking bout
But now you're right here, oh
And now it's so real
Shorty my plane leave at nine AM tomorrow
But between then and now we can go far
Oh

We only got one night the suns gon' be setting in a while
(Be ready, be ready)
We still got moonlight I'm down for whatever right now
(Be ready, be ready)
Oh when the sky starts, sky starts changing
Sweet love we'll be making, oh
Just tell me
(You ready, you ready?)

Ayo, we got one
Yo, we got one
Yo, we got one, ayo
Oh baby, I'mma take it slow
I don't wanna let you go, never let go
Oh, I know you've been patient
Been waiting on this moment
Right here, right now

We only got one night the suns gon' be setting in a while
(Be ready, be ready)
We still got moonlight I'm down for whatever right now
(Be ready, be ready)
Oh when the sky starts, sky starts changing
Sweet love we'll be making, oh
Just tell me
(You ready, you ready?)
