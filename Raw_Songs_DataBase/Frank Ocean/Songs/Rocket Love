"Three minutes forty five seconds and counting, we are still a go at this time"

Listening to Star Trek's star tracks
On the track to stars and back
Only after we get to the end

Passing planets feeling small
On the mattress floating off
How you breathing up here with nothing on, nothing on, baby girl

But you look good in your spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Oh, up here, up here

I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they're burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh

"Two minutes ten seconds and counting"

The candle's burning in the sun
We don't need them but you like them
They glow they glow, oh yeah
We were at the bar for quite a while
Took some time but we collided
Big bang, big bang, look at what we made beautiful

But you look good in that spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Oh, up here, up here

I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they're burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh

We can make believe that we're up there
But we're only in the backseat of this eclipse ooh
If the lights go by, that means the cops flew by
But they won't bother us, no no no no

I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they're burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they're burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh

I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they're burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they're burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh

"20 seconds and counting
T minus 15 seconds, guidance is internal
12, 11, 10, 9, ignition sequence start
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, all engines running
Lift off, we have a lift off, lift off"
