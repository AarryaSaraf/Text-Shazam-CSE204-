I'm back at it, automatic
I'm back at it, automatic
Let's go

Yeah I know I'm probably wasting my time
But listen here, I got some shit on my mind
I know it's obvious that I'm the talk of the town
You seem to move fame or get the money bringing you down

Everywhere I go it's a media frenzy
All they seem to care about is me Kim or Lindsey
Is the story real? You don't even know
Do you even care? Yeah I thought so
Yeah yeah I know they wanna see me

I can't lose focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money
I'm losing focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money

Yeah I know I'm probably wasting my time
But listen here, I got some shit on my mind
I know it's obvious that I'm the talk of the town
You seem to move fame or get the money bringing you down

Everywhere I go it's a media frenzy
All they seem to care about is me Kim or Lindsey
Is the story real? You don't even know
Do you even care? Yeah I thought so
Yeah yeah I know they wanna see me

I can't lose focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money
I'm losing focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money

I'm back at it, automatic
I'm back at it, automatic

I can't lose focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money
I'm losing focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money

I can't lose focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money
I'm losing focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money
