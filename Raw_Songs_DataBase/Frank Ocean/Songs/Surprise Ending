I didn't notice the signs
You covered both of my eyes
(Mix-match text messages, voicemail evidence)
The audience yelling, "Damn, she's blind."
Now it's all so clear
And I was also not scared
(Now I know she missed stunt double skipped on it)
Audience kept yelling, "Not the space

(I could say that I knew the whole time) But I would be lying
(You'd have to be a hidden camera) Recording each take of crying
(I would say that I would just go to your part) To stop the taping
(But the end's here) And I can't change it

The suspense is building
Sitting on edge of my seat now
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
While the plot was thickening
I was hanging off the cliff love
You said it's a surprise! What's the surprise... ending?

You didn't notice the signs
You thought I'd just let it slide
(Guess you kept missing it Homeboys visiting)
The audience yelling, "Yeah, that's right."
And now it's not so clear
You don't know how you missed me (Gone)
Gone while you were gone
Stopped going through your phone
The audience yelling, "'Bout damn time."

(I could say that I knew the whole time) But I would be lying
(You'd have to be a hidden camera) Recording each take of crying
(I would say that I would just go to your part) To stop the taping
(But the end is here) And you can't change it

The suspense is building
Sitting on edge of my seat now
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
While the plot was thickening
I was hanging off the cliff love
You said it's a surprise! What's the surprise... ending?

Everything was okay when I was the victim
Had me made out to be so naive
Never knew I was working on a masterpiece
So by the time you thought you had me, yeah
I worked on my grand finale, yeah
So now as the credits roll
You're shocked to find out how it all unfolds

The suspense is building
Sitting on edge of my seat now
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
While the plot was thickening
I was hanging off the cliff love
You said it's a surprise! What's the surprise... ending?

(Ending... Ending... No...)
You didn't notice the signs
You thought I'd just let it slide
Yeah
