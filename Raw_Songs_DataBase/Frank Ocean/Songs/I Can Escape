Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
I see your eyes, eyes fall
You don't wanna cry
You keep your eyes closed
I could be great, I'm on my way
I want escape, I can escape
Uh, I could be great, I'm on my way
If I want escape, I can escape
Uh, I could be great, I'm on my way
If I want escape, I could escape
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm
I see your eyes, I see your eyes fall
You don't wanna cry so, you keep your eyes closed
I could be great, I'm on my way
If I want escape, I can escape
I could be great, I'm on my way
If I want escape, I can escape
Uh, comin' out fadin', telephone gauge
I had an M5, headlights, I spotted the keys
Race on a date, race and sedate
I know you lie, you just don't lie to my face
I keep it graceful, I-I can escape, huh, huh
Comin' out fadin', telephone gauge
Had an M5, headlights, I spotted the jakes
Race on a date, race and sedate
I know you lie, you just don't lie to my face
An' I could be great

How was that?
Oh, it's fire? Cool, cool
Yeah

I saw your eyes, I saw your eyes fall
You don't wanna cry, so you kept your eyes closed
I could be great, I'm on my way
If I wanna escape, I can escape
Uh, we was on a date
I took you to Met, kisses, outside your favorite
I don't like fried chicken, I don't want no Chick-fil-A
And I don't even rob, niggas, can't do that job through the day
Comin' out fake, turn off engage
I had the M5 when the headlights was spotted out the jakes
Race on a date, race and sedate
I know you lie to me, you just don't lie to my face
I can be great, so I'm grateful for it
You just wanna hate, you gotta give for it
You don't wanna fight, you ain't built for that, uh?
That roll call, you can see my hands
Jaws gon' break, lip gon' bust, you like
I snuck up on me and ain't say nothin'
Bit until my tongue gushes, I couldn't say that
Huh, I ain't say nothin'
I ain't say nothin', uh, uh
I say nothin', mm, I say nothin'
What you dream for? Dream for, mm

Used to play tough with the cops, had ideas (Go, go)
Through the protests, hold me in spot, and I'll go
Black folk know what talkin' white mean, but still
Hold two open hands up in the sky, finger quotes
In my gang, the youth, my lames used to smell like Polo tees
Mazel tov toss him a bottle, like what Puff did to Steve
You can't tote your own weight, then what's this bullshit even 'bout?
Crystals on your lil' feet, that's all that dust protein
Swoop Tremaine from Calabasas
In a Brit sports car
We used to cypher in Marc Jacobs
Had the library card
At Scott's comparing the silver spoons
To plastic knives and sporks
I was the dog breathless chasing the car up the street
If I ever catch it I'll panic
That's the flaw in me
And nothing glamorous about growing
Up Poor and naive
Standing on the balls of my feet
Trying to pray before I sleep

Go ahead red light, standing at the waterfront district
Now my head on a cushion
Like pink, I'm revvin', like green, I'm swimmin'
Someone like you, someone like me, ring finger, might sure get took it
Wrist like springs, natural springs, waterin' head, no cookie
Other than me and you, and nobody else comin' between a cool star
We got the camera on Monday
We made a movie on Tuesday, fuck
We got to look, to look, we never seen stars, it looks so bright

Damn, I try to sleep, can't get a lot, made dreams bleed into days
The pressure couldn't stop the bleeding, I started seeing things
Watching out for demons
Blocking out them like to screen these plays
I was always reading ya
There's some heaven where the sun don't shine
And I started feeling like pussy poppin was the paradigm
Get my dick wet, maritime
I'm immersified
All my friends in smoke, smoke blazing, trail behind
Or he rose in front of mine
It's rappers who evolve with time
Reductive in all the rhymes
But that time they enforce the biased
You know, it's some cops stop and frisk the guy
'Cause he brown so of course he sized
And all the gangs these lames it's extorted by
Switch lanes in the Porsche I driving
That the police Ford Explorer by
Sirens screaming like they four or five
Throwing tantrums on the 405
So I don't wait, like I'm tryna gain
Don't hibernate in the winter
That's where summer bodies are made
Just leg days like a sprinter
With the brown, baby blue interior
Big Bs like GMOs
And they sting on my eyes closed
All I see with my eyes closed
Blame my emo on time zones
It's the same but different sets of twins, siblings
Experience excesses

Go ahead red light, standing at the waterfront district
Now my head on a cushion
Like pink, I'm revvin', like green, I'm swimmin'
Someone like you, someone like me, ring finger, might sure get took it
Wrist like springs, natural springs, waterin' head, no cookie
Other than me and you and nobody else comin' between a cool star
We got the camera on Monday
We made a movie on Tuesday, fuck
We got the look, good looks, ain't never seen stars that look so bright

Prayin' mantis, flipped by the asian's first fall of rain, big Pharrell prayin' hand
Big P, big P, bust our face, keep up those alien hands
I wanna see the money in cash so that I could truly grasp
Makin' a save, they got that a favor, big for a prayin' hands

Big P, big P, big P, big P
Yeah, huh, big P
Speakin' of God, at ten years old, I switched church homes
Speakin' of God, speakin' of God, speakin' of God
Yeah, hmm
Don't wanna talk me off the ledge, mmm
Gotta get in my, mmm
Gotta get in my own head
Ooh, yeah
You can go there, yeah
Whenever you feel like it, duh, nuh, huh, nuh
Mm, the first, though, maybe keep it in four, though
Uh-huh

Speakin' of God, at ten years old, I switched church homes
The bishop was tweakin', and we was Baptist
So how you a bishop? Like, technically speakin'
You drove a white Rolls, me and my family was tight, bros
Difference between havin' a home and not havin' a home is a tightrope
Vistin' Catholic churches, the pastor was quiet as mice, so
Minister spoke on a microphone
They had no choir, so silent, I thought I heard Christ, cold
Need a messiah, run out the house from home while she's seven months pregnant with Ryan
I figured I'd go to the East with my team for some peace and quiet
I ended up runnin the streets with my cousin sittin' in the back
Listenin' to beats, schemin' on schemes that can't even pass
It's strategy, murder your cells, I'm far according to stats
I pray that the plots clearin', thick, it's bulletproof glass
So much where the death is, the visions of days
You keep speakin' of death, it starts to seem' like a new car you're gonna buy
Starts poppin' up on your way to work
You see it all the time, always passin' by
Call it plan Beetle, Bug, yeah, it's on sight, better throw a punch
Runnin' late to Teterboro, made the plane wait 'cause there's no rush
Calls for no one oceans from above, kinda look like bubbles on the tub
Kinda like mmm
