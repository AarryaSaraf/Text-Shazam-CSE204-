If I had 20 million dollars in the vault somewhere, baby
It wouldn't matter anyway, yeah
Cause the doctor told me that I'm dying slowly
So I guess I gotta love you while I'm here baby
Did you know ?

News said that the sky is falling
The globe is warming
My country's warring
The leaders are lying
Time is running
Lower and lower babe, lower babe

I know we just met
But baby could you love me quickly, quickly
I want you to love me like ya know the worlds about to end, baby
Quickly

You told me I don't even know your name
I said well then we might as well make ours the same
What you think, baby?
(No time)
Vegas might as well be light-years away
So we better lie under the stars
Before they're crashing down
Cause I heard

News said that the sky is falling
The globe is warming
My country's warring
The leaders are lying
Time is running
Lower and lower babe, lower babe

I know we just met
But baby could you love me quickly, quickly
I want you to love me like ya know the worlds about to end, baby
Quickly

That's right baby kiss me like the earth is quaking
Like the Earth is shaking
You got it baby
That's right love me
Feel me like our time is sprinting faster
Running out on us

I know we just met
But baby could you love me quickly, quickly
Gotta love me like you know the worlds about to end, baby
Quickly, yeah

Barely know me baby
But you gotta love me quickly, quickly, oh
Gotta love me like you know the worlds about to end, baby
Quickly

Gotta love me like you know the worlds about to end, baby
Quickly
