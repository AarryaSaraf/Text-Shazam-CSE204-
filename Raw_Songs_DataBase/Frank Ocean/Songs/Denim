A good pair of dark blues
Hand washed by me and by you
We care enough to never let them drag, never let them tear

We kept the tags on them so we could remember
Exactly what it cost us to get here to get this pair (ah)
To get here, to get there to get this pair of ours

Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like, got a love like that
A love that lasts, a love that lasts
A love that lasts, a love that we can wear
Got a love like denim

Good jeans, with good care
A lifetime of good fade and good wear
And what we have with this
Is cut from the same cloth, cut from the same cloth

We kept the tags on them so we could remember
Exactly what it cost us to get here to get this pair (ah)
To get here, to get there to get this pair of ours

Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like, got a love like that
A love that lasts, a love that lasts
A love that lasts, a love that we can wear
Got a love like denim

Come on, put your hand in my back pocket lets walk
Out here, yeah
And let the weather, weather ours
And never mind the sun
And never mind the faded
Cause were strong and we look good in denim

Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like, got a love like that
A love that lasts, a love that lasts
A love that lasts, a love that we can wear
Got a love like denim
