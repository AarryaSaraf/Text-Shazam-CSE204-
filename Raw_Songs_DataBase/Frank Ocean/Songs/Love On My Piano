I just wanna make love
I just wanna make love
I just wanna make love

Play a couple chords, jump on board
If you wanna ride out (if you wanna ride out)
I'mma hit a few keys, bring you down to your knees
So you don't wanna leave now (don't wanna leave)
I got you up in my house now, ow
Fix you up another Mai Thai, Thai
No sun on the horizon, on
Let's make a song for the night time, time

I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano

Stroke of harmony, kiss you on your neck
I'm changing up your voice sound (changing up your sound)
I'ma do what I said and take you to the bridge
And make you climax now (ah ah)
Now we switching up the melody, ay
We take it down to a minor C, C
We making noise like we can't believe, ay
Let's put this moment on replay

I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano

Oh
Girl, what you wanna do?
Back it up, back it up, back it up, up, up
Back it up, back it up, back it up, up, up
I think I got a clue
Girl, what you wanna do?
You wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano

I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano
