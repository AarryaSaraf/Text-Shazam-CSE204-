Yeah, bring an amp up here
Let me plug my guitar in
I wanna play for you baby
Can you hear me?
Oh, it's a sold out crowd
I'm kind of nervous
And they yelling my name out
Can you hear 'em?

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, I would cancel if I could (whoa, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh
You said if I loved you then I would

Make it a private show, intimate affair
Sitting in the front row, only ones here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
If you want a private show
Doors are closing, doors are closing, doors are closing
Private show, intimate affair
Dancing in the front row, only one here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
And you want a
VIP, backstage pass and all that
VIP, backstage pass and all that

I really love my fans
So we gotta move quickly
And once I finish here
Don't shout out encore
You can sing along to my songs, and then
Then I'll applaud you, and then

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, I would cancel if I could (whoa, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh
You said if I loved you then I would

Make it a private show, intimate affair
Sitting in the front row, only ones here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
If you want a private show
Doors are closing, doors are closing, doors are closing
Private show, intimate affair
Dancing in the front row, only one here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
And you want a
VIP, backstage pass and all that
VIP, backstage pass and all that

Live so much better than the radio
Bet-bet-better than the radio
Live so much better than the radio
Bet-bet-better than the radio
Live so much better than the radio
Bet-bet-better than the radio
Live so much better, live so much better

Private show, intimate affair
Sitting in the front row, only ones here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
If you want a private show
Doors are closing, doors are closing, doors are closing
Private show, intimate affair
Dancing in the front row, only one here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
And you want a
VIP, backstage pass and all that
VIP, backstage pass and all that
