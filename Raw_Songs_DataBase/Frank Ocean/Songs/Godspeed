I will always love you how I do
Let go of a prayer for you
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ball so hard, all my boys flex
Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Still I'll always be there for you how I do
I let go of my claim on you
It's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home always

(Godspeed, glory)
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (Oh)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
Until it's time
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (Oh)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (Oh)
Oh, it's 'til it's time we die
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind

Oh-oh, oh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh-oh, oh
