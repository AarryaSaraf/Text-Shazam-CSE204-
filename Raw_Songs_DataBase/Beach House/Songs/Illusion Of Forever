Diamonds down her back
Sunshine in her lap
Centuries of light
Rubies in her hair
Moonlight in her stare
Centuries of light
Diamonds down her back

Sunday song, the way home is long
Sailing to the stars, I wonder why it's so hard?

Always, always
Centuries of light
And I can't believe in nothing just yet
(Always, always, always)
Can't believe in nothing just yet

Diamonds down her back
Baby girl, I know you so well
And I'll always be right here

Rubies in her hair
So we go
To someplace none can know
Sailing to the stars, I wonder why it's so hard?

Always always
Centuries of light
And I can't believe in nothing just yet
(Always, always, always)
Can't believe in nothing just yet

Diamonds down her back
In this world, I know you so well
And I'll always be right here
(Always, always, always)
And I can't believe in nothing just yet
