Invite your sister
into the garden
all cannot play
fist full of wild flowers
hand picked by someone
who nearly fell

(ahhh, ahhh)

friend foe or feather
if we roll together
give my gift to you
in all kinds of weather
if not now not ever
please do not go

hands over your eyes
recalling your size
is it the right time
for the game we play
in all kinds of weather
if not now not ever
this is the right time
for a holiday

(la, la, la, la)

you came to me
in my dreams
and you spoke of everything
sweeter than the days that I was breathing
how on earth did anything...
