Roller skating in the parking lot
I don't care 'case I like it vacant
Do you know what your heart is for?
In case you did forget it

Red sunglasses and a lollipop
See her dressed in the polka dot
Came around in the alley smoke
Confetti on the floor

Is it over? Yeah it's over
The best time of all
I was not looking
For it

Favorite movie on the TV screen
Black sequins disappearing
Another story about a beauty queen
Wore my dress then I ripped against it

Is it over? Yeah it's over
The best time of all
I was not looking
For it

Memory likes to talk a lot
I don't care because I know I'll forget it
When I put my fingers up
All the sparkles wouldn't let it

The best time of all
I was not looking
For it

Do you know better?
Yeah I know better
Yeah I know better

Do you know better?
Yeah I know better
Yeah I know better

Do you know better?
Yeah I know better
Yeah I know better

Do you know better?
Yeah I know better
Yeah I know better

Do you know better?
Yeah I know better
Yeah I know better

Do you know better?
Yeah I know better
Yeah I know better

Do you know better?
Yeah I know better
Yeah I know better
