She comes dressed like Sunday
String of pearls around her neck
Room of mirrors, days of lace
Porcelain and picturesque

Her eyes masquerade, fade to black

Roses on the winding path
Velvet ribbon down her back
Shadows lie across her face
Drowning in a state of grace

Her eyes masquerade, fade to black
They'll come at night, to take her back

Want to need you
Need to please you
Do you see her in the mirror?
In the mirror, do you see her?
Want to need you
Need to please you

Her eyes masquerade, fade to black
They'll come at night, to take her back

Light each candle, here tonight then gone forever
Light each candle, here tonight then gone forever
Here tonight then gone forever
Here tonight then gone forever
Here tonight then gone forever
Here tonight then gone forever
