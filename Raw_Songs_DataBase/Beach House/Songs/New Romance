Days go by, no reply
The smoke high on the avenue
You and I know that
You're not gonna leave it anyway
Pick me up, I know you're close
The headlights running down the wall

Last night I'm messing up
Now I feel like dressing up
I-L-Y-S-F-M

Take my chances, new romances
Eyes roll on the avenue
Left on red, daylight moving backwards
'Cause you're off again
Can you fly higher than a hawk
Flies in a black star sky?

Last night I'm messing up
Now I feel like dressing up
I-L-Y-S-F-M

Block after block
With the speakers on
Night after night
We say our goodbyes

My love drips in red out of my mind at the edge of the sky
You feel your heart break and you don't know why
You're somebody else, somebody new
"Fuck it", you said, "it's beginning to look like the end"
So sick of swimming, I'm in over my head
No wrong or right, I know it's true

Last night I'm messing up
Now I feel like dressing up
Last night I'm messing up
Now I feel like dressing up
