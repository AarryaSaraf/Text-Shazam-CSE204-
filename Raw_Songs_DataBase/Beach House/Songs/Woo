I want it all, but I can't have it
It inches by but I cannot say much
But I want it all and I want it all

I want it all, but I can't have it
It inches by but I cannot say much
But I want it all and I want it all

When she closes her eyes
Looks inside
Never knowing
Shooting for the stars
It's gone too far
And you know it

I can't keep you there
You will braid your hair
Throw it everywhere
You're everywhere
You don't give a fuck
Swimming pools
Forever glowing
You break all the rules

It's a trick of the eye
You will braid your hair
Throw it everywhere
It passes me by
In a swimming pool
You break all the rules
Keeps on going
Backseat, give a fuck

I want it all, but I can't have it
It inches by but I cannot say much
But I want it all and I want it all

You're my trick of the eye
I want it all
That passes me by
But I can't have it
Keeps on going
I can't keep you there
It inches by, but
Or everywhere
I cannot say much
Forever glowing
You're my trick of the eye
But I want it all
That passes me by
And I want it all
Keeps on going
