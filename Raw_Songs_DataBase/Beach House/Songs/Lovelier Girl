Long days of wanting you here
living in fear
shedding a tear for you

Long nights of pasty face tunes
echo in rooms
filling with gloom for me

Letters so hard to mail
feeling like the wind from the sea

Now I step into the line
girl on the
in all the world than you

There's nothing lovelier, girl
in all the world than making love to you

Letters so hard to mail
feeling like the wind from the sea

Lately got to thinking that
how I long to have you here with me
