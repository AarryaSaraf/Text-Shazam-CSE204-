In the night I called your
name - heart of mine
one letter at a time.
I'll be found in a
land of savages
Ah-h...

Maybe you
don't know what you've got,
spent yer money on
desert lots -
holy dances and acronyms
for her.

Bury your maps, they'll find
all you pots and pans
cross all your hands, one
finger at a time
you'll be found in a
land of savages ah-h...

Maybe you don't know what
you've got,
husk to hide and I know you're
not, spending money
on a desert rose -
holy dances and acronyms
for bones.
