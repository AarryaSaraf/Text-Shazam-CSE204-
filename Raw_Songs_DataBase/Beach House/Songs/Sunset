Lay me where the flowers grow
(Lay me where the flowers grow)
For the palace is descending
(For the palace is descending)
Golden fans across the land now
(Golden fans across the land now)

Just one key ties everything

Blackbird red, the wings that spread, winds that turn, a pretty word
Bird of prey, the clothing lay, on the line, and out to dry
Broken fence and two arms length, spidersilk, and sweet nonsense

Just one key ties everything

Sugar on her eyelids, cosmos for the veil

For the palace is descending
(For the palace is descending)
The country where she's going, someday we all shall find
Lay me where the flowers growing
(Lay me where the flowers growing)
Choose the one to follow, take them in your arms
Golden fans across the land now
(Golden fans across the land now)
Golden fans across the land now

Just one key ties everything
