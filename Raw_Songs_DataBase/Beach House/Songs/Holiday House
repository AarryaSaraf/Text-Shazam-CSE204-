Drive all night
Up to the old driveway
Looking for the holiday house
Where love runs about

Friends who wore
Ribbons in their hair
Talked about a new doomsday
And the old window displays

Hang my head
Off of the swimming pool
Into the bittersweet
Under the Milky Way

La la la
La la la la, la
La la la
La la la la, la

Open the holiday book
Look at the pictures you took
When you light the fire
You will see their smiles

Long driveway
Give all your cares away
Look at the skies above
Look at the mourning dove

Look at another day
Sweet little runaway
Running through the high cornfields
Scratches that do feel real

La la la
La la la la, la
La la la
La la la la, la

Drive all night
Up to the old driveway
Looking for the holiday house
Where love runs about

Drive all night
Up to the old driveway
Looking for the holiday house
Where love runs about

Here's to the holiday house (La la la)
We can go nowhere now (La la la la, la)
Here's to the holiday house (La la la)
We can go nowhere now (La la la la, la)
