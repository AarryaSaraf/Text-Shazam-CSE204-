Hello
You're humming tomorrow's never songs

But you're singing the only words you know
Would you cry, If I lied
On the dam

I chose yeah
You're ringing the only wedding bell ell ell
And we're swimming the seas we known so well
I've tried to stay alive, in our bed, in our head

Oh, but your wish is my command

Ahhhh
Is your heart still mine to sail
I enjoy
Nothing
ahhhh

I chose yeah
You're ring the only wedding bell
And we're swimming the seas we known so well
I tried staying alive in our bed in our head

Oh, but your wish is my command
