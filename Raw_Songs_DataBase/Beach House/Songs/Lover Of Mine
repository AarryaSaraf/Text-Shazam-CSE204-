You hear my cry, lover of mine
No tear in the eye or fear in my mind
The forest is thick and you don't recognize
We parted our lips and we reached from inside

In a wide open field we know we can feel
Awake and unreal, off to nowhere

Need more people to be satisfied
No fear of a god and prayer for the night
You come into our minds and rush through our lives
We parted our lips and reached from inside

In a wide open field we know we can feel
Awake and unreal, off to nowhere

The only thing you've got, you know you're better off without it

Youngest fire, you decide
You decide what is right

Near yet so far, isn't it?
