Clouds part
She's rolling down the water
But it always rains

And we'll hold you
The rest of your life

In your lace
Were you lazy?
Always counting
A first time

She's rolling down the window
But it always rains

And we'll hold you
The rest of your life

Spend your money
Acting funny
Get yourselves
In the hallroom

She's rolling down the window
But it's always raining
But it's always raining

And we'll hold you
The rest of your life
