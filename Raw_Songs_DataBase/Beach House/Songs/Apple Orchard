You only give me
what you don't want no more
ask the questions
that you don't know at all

let's lie down for awhile
you can smile
lay your head in the old
old fashion

you know how it is my friend
in the boxes of those picture frames
hold your inside 'cause you're cold at night
warm your heart, love, 'cause you're by my side

let's lie down for awhile
you can smile
lay your head in the old
old fashion

lay your hand on me
apple orchard
take your time
you can settle down
hold your breath
'cause you're, you are nothing
hold your hand on me
for a while
