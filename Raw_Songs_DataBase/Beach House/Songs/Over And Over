When the lights go down and divide the day
Out of nothing comes the moonglow
And all that is left (and all that is left) around you
When all the lights go down

One by one, they open, forever and ever
All the little angels descend

A flicker in the sky reflects the dying light
Wherever you may go, a halo
And all that is lit (and all that is lit) surrounds you
As all the lights go down

One by one, they open, forever and ever
All the little angels descend

Lilac, lily, anemone in poses
Soft, frail and blue, the violets too, and roses

All the little angels, forever and ever
One by one, they open, over and over again

And so, these days, go (over and over)
To each, that follows
The night, that has no end (over and over)
Will be the last, my friend
And so, these days, go (over and over)
To each, that follows
The night, that has no end (over and over)
Will be the last, my friend

Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
Over and over
