A silhouette that comes to me
As your state of infinity
Even in your equal mind
You were passing through this time

Delicate with no defense
You honor what you love to no end
Perfection in the accident
Truly yours is just what I meant

Equal Mind 
Equal Mind 
Equal Mind 


There is no way you could know
These waves they come and they go
In blooms they're chasing the lights
Too soon they say these goodbyes

Equal Mind 
Equal Mind 
Equal Mind
