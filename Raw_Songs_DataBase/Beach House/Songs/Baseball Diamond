You think of tomorrow
The things you'll get done
Your family's a portrait
When spaces come down
She says she will meet you when
It's quite passable
No time like the evening
The baseball diamond
Oh

You can't find your ticket
The hands in the air
So while it's a foul ball
The children won't care
She sits smiling next to you
The sun on the edge
The circle awaits the calm
When he comes to pitch
No hands like the evening
I want you to win
I feel like it's coming
The second steal in

She sits like the season
The sun washes in
A break in the clouds
No time like to win
No time like tomorrow
The baseball diamond

Playmakers waiting for the sun to come down
Playmakers waiting for the sun to come down

Playmakers waiting for the sun
Playmakers waiting for the sun
