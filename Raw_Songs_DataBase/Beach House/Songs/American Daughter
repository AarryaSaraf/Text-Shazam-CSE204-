When I met her
Knees together
She held my head there
Underwater
So I tried harder
To forget her
American Daughter

But my mind wanders
Through visions of her
Heart-shaped letters
She is made of
Every other
She is static
Then technicolor
And to know her
Is to love her
American Daughter

Dreamt about her
Some nights after
Concrete baby
Walked her home late

When I met her
Knees together
We held our heads there
Underwater
She is made of
Every other
Did I lose her?
Did I break her?
American Daughter

And to know her
Is to love her
Dreamt about her
