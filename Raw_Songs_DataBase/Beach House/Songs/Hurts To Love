Lookin' out at the wide wild world
It's a lot for the boys and girls
There's a lot of bad things out there
When they nod and they just don't care
You've got imagination

If it hurts to love
Better do it anyway

A friend of mine is a friend of yours
It's a gift but it's always a curse
To go on without it
You carve it out of a bad bad heart
It's the thing that tears you apart
It's got to come from something

If it hurts to love you
Should I walk away?

If it hurts to love
You better do it anyway
If it hurts too much
Well I loved you anyway

Lookin' out at the wide wild world
It's a lot for the boys and girls
You carve it out of a bad bad heart
It's the thing that tears us apart

If it hurts to love
You better do it anyway
