Open up your mind and let me step inside
Rest your weary head and let your heart decide
It's so easy, when you know the rules
It's so easy, all you have to do is fall in love

Play the game, ev'rybody play, play the game of love

When you're feelin' down and your resistance is low
Light another cigarette and let yourself go
This is your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world, all you have to do is fall in love

Play the game, ev'rybody play, play the game

Love runs from my head down to my toes
My love is pumping through my veins
Driving me insane

Play the game, ev'rybody play, play the game of love

This is your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free, free world, all you have to do is fall in love

Play the game, ev'rybody play, play the game of love
