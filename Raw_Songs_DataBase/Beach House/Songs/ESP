What everybody knows
Not everybody shows

You caught me looking over
Tears were in your eyes
What cuts you, makes you bolder
Could you read my mind?

What everybody knows
Not everybody shows

Look around, little one
All this writing on the wall
You know it comes
When you start to fall

What makes someone a stranger?
Is it someplace you won't go?
Somewhere you could get faded
Someway to keep you close

What everybody knows
Not everybody shows

Here you are, damage done
Pointless aiming in the dark
You will know when it comes
Stick around, little one
All the writings on the wall
You know it comes
When you start to fall
