Cleopatra's portrait, in the bathroom line
All the parties ended with a lust for life
A dark mouth surrounds us, into the stardust

I stand before the ending, carousel ascending
The end is the beginning, beginning to an ending
Like the cells dividing, zeroes multiplying

You tell me it existed, as you lie beside me
From the early wars, to modern love stories
I reach into the darkness, the universe collects us
