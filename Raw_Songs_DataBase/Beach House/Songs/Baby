Baby's having such fun
Baby thinks he's the one
One and only exception
But he'll go down like the rest of them

April comes for one more May
The floor is swept, the clothes are put away
And that's a day

Have you heard the news
Baby had to choose
Now he's on the wall
Can you make a judgement call

April comes for one more May
The floor is swept, the clothes are put away
And that's a day
