Many nights
Spent our light
To a side
Do you recognize?
Many others
Little flowers
Many nights
By your side
Listening high
To suicide

With the stars above you
Do you really want to?

We're on this ride
Two to a side
Do I recognize?
In your eyes

With the stars above you
Do you really want to?

Many nights
Like any other night
I saw
And you know

Play it last
Play it low
Let it ride
Let it go
Slow you rock
Slow you roll

Many nights
Many nights
Many nights
