Down the hill I hoped that I'd find
Something I could rest my hands on
In the distant sun is setting
Deer are jumping over hedges

By the dock of the pond Turtle Island
I will wait for you there, creeping
Silently, I can't keep you
Right behind me
All my days in the sun...

In the waters, trace her features,
Did they scare you, hardened creatures
In that murky, green perfection
Did they warn you of dissection...
How? What, why, when...?

By the dock of the pond Turtle Island
I will wait for you there, creeping
Silently, I can't keep you
Right behind me
All my days in the sun...

How I want Olive to know,
That inside me she'll always grow.
In all colors and prizes
You will always
Remain

By the dock of the pond Turtle Island
By the dock of the pond Turtle Island
I can't keep you
Right behind me
All my days in the sun...
