It's strange and makes you wonder
What is it about her
A certain fascination
With the dark side of the street
It's strange and makes you wonder

Some call it black magic
It's altogether tragic
Living in a moment
You feel has come before
Some call it black magic

It's strange and makes you wonder
You stay a little longer
Secrets to uncover
And every moment numbered
It's strange and makes you wonder

And all of this black magic
Is floating in the air
Where the rivers come together
A million miles away
It's strange and makes you wonder
