The kind you like
To come back in
Wherever you go

No hook inside
The sea will dry
The sun's just set

The brightened lines
Stick by your side
Wherever you go

The kind you like
Have come back here
They told you so

Wherever you go
Nobody is true
The light's off

Wherever you go
Nobody is true

The kind you like
No end in sight
The rest you know
