There's a light going out tonight
Driving fast
Flashing lines
It's too late now to say goodbye
The stars were there
In our eyes

When you were mine
We fell across the sky
Backlit up against the wall
Out there on the run
You're not the only one
Shadow from the sun

Somewhere out on the radio
Look up high
Now you're gone
I see it now in this photograph
Something good
Never meant to last
I don't wanna know how the story ends
From now to then

When you were mine
We fell across the sky
It may be out of sight but never out of mind
Out there on the run
You're not the only one
Shadow from the sun
Backlit up against the wall

Superstar, shining far

When you were mine
We fell across the sky
It may be out of sight but never out of mind
Out there on the run
You're not the only one
Shadow from the sun
Backlit up against the wall

Superstar, shining far

When you were mine
It may be out of sight but never out of mind
Backlit up against the wall
Superstar, shining far
