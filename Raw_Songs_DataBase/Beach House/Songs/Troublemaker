Like a hand you reached out to me
The thunder rolls in with the dark
Tiny fingers on the edges
Watch it unravel
Pulling everything apart

In the back we stay together
The walls are shaking in their skin
Does it become you troublemaker
Watch them unravel you
Pulling everything apart

Someday out of the blue
It will find you
Always
Always a face to remind me
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you

You watch the shape these things are taking
Do you cry out in your sleep
Does it become you when you're under
Your heart is racing you're taking everything too hard

When you walk away
You show me how
Come pull me under

Someday out of the blue
It will find you
Always
Always a face to remind me
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you

Someday out of the blue
It will find you
Always
Always a face to remind you
