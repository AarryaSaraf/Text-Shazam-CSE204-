Out in the summer sun
She was the only one
Days go by
In her eyes
Belle de jour in front of me
No matter where you go
There'll always be your shadow

(La-la-la) Days go by
(La-la-la) In her eyes
Once, twice, Melody

The purple on the vine
The velvet deep tree line
Nights fly by
In her mind
All along the boulevard
She tries to understand
A never, never land

(La-la-la) Across the room
(La-la-la) Sweet perfume
The sun, the moon, the raindrops too

Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da

(La-la-la) Days go by
(La-la-la) In her eyes
Once, twice, Melody

Ba-da-da-da-da
Ba-da-da-da-da

(La-la-la) Days go by
(La-la-la) In her eyes
Once, twice, Melody

Once, twice, Melody
