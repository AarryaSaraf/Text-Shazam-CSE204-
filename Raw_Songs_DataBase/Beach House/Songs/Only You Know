Don't blink...

I saw you standing there
With the sunshine in your hair
You come to my window
You tell me you're high
Where do all the friends go when the fantasies die?
Only you know

Don't blink...

You were sweet like a candy cane
I didn't even know your name
You tell me you're leaving, you tell me you're gone
But you always stay until you hear your song
I go along

In the summer blaze
Under melting days
All tomorrow's skies
Feel it every time
On my way to you
On my way to you

Don't blink...

And while those days are gone
Do you know you were the only one?
Every disaster comes faster and faster
And everyone says it was fun while it lasted
It went right past us

In the summer blaze
Under melting days
All tomorrow's skies
Feel it every time
(You tell me you're leaving, you tell me you're gone)
On my way to you
(But you always stay until you hear your song)
(I go along)
On my way to you (You come to my window, you tell me you're high)
(Where do all the friends go when the fantasies die?)
On my way to you
(Only you know, only you know)
