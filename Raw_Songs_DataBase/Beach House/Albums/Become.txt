Album: Become

// American Daughter //

When I met her
Knees together
She held my head there
Underwater
So I tried harder
To forget her
American Daughter

But my mind wanders
Through visions of her
Heart-shaped letters
She is made of
Every other
She is static
Then technicolor
And to know her
Is to love her
American Daughter

Dreamt about her
Some nights after
Concrete baby
Walked her home late

When I met her
Knees together
We held our heads there
Underwater
She is made of
Every other
Did I lose her?
Did I break her?
American Daughter

And to know her
Is to love her
Dreamt about her

// Devil's Pool //

Never expected too much
We just fell out of touch
With your chances in life
How could you get it right?
It's okay, darling
You're just too far away for talking

You hide the hospital bills
And at night I see pills
They go blue, white, and red
They go straight to your head
In a Devil's pool
You don't know the rules
You're just somebody's fool
But, I love you

Easy come, easy go
Are you high? Are you low?
Should I stay? Should I go?
Easy come, easy go
Easy come, easy go
Are you high? Are you low?

It's okay, darling
You're just too far away for talking

In a Devil's pool
You don't know the rules
You're just somebody's fool
But, I love you

Easy come, easy go
Are you high or low?
Should I stay? Should I go?
Easy come, easy go

// Holiday House //

Drive all night
Up to the old driveway
Looking for the holiday house
Where love runs about

Friends who wore
Ribbons in their hair
Talked about a new doomsday
And the old window displays

Hang my head
Off of the swimming pool
Into the bittersweet
Under the Milky Way

La la la
La la la la, la
La la la
La la la la, la

Open the holiday book
Look at the pictures you took
When you light the fire
You will see their smiles

Long driveway
Give all your cares away
Look at the skies above
Look at the mourning dove

Look at another day
Sweet little runaway
Running through the high cornfields
Scratches that do feel real

La la la
La la la la, la
La la la
La la la la, la

Drive all night
Up to the old driveway
Looking for the holiday house
Where love runs about

Drive all night
Up to the old driveway
Looking for the holiday house
Where love runs about

Here's to the holiday house (La la la)
We can go nowhere now (La la la la, la)
Here's to the holiday house (La la la)
We can go nowhere now (La la la la, la)

// Black Magic //

It's strange and makes you wonder
What is it about her
A certain fascination
With the dark side of the street
It's strange and makes you wonder

Some call it black magic
It's altogether tragic
Living in a moment
You feel has come before
Some call it black magic

It's strange and makes you wonder
You stay a little longer
Secrets to uncover
And every moment numbered
It's strange and makes you wonder

And all of this black magic
Is floating in the air
Where the rivers come together
A million miles away
It's strange and makes you wonder

// Become //

Keep you close to me
Oh, sweet remedy
Bright and crystalline
Take it as it comes
Holy morning sun
Rubies on my tongue
La-la, la-la

Become light
What's inside
All around you
Time goes by
Don't you cry
Become light

Love is like a fire
Light it, it goes high
Keep you close to me
La-la, la-la

Love is like a fire (Time goes by)
Light it, it goes high (What's inside)
Keep you close to me (Become light)

La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la (Time goes by)
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la (What's inside)
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la (Become light)
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la (Time goes by)
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la (What's inside)
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la (Become light)
