// Zebra //

You know you're gold, you don't gotta worry none
Oasis child, born and so wild
Don't I know you better than the rest
All deception, all deception from you

Your love is stag in the white sand
Wilderness for miles, eyes so mild and wise
Don't I know you better than the rest
All deception, all deception from you

Any way you run, you run before us
Black and white horse arching among us

Your love is stag in the white sand
Oasis child born into a man
Don't I know you better than the rest
All deception, all deception from you

Wilderness for miles, eyes so mild and wise
Oasis child, born and so wild
Don't I know you better than the rest
All deception, all deception from you

Any way you run, you run before us
Black and white horse arching among us

// Silver Soul //

We gather medicine for heartache
So we can act a fool
It's incomplete without you
The silver soul is running through
It's a vision, complete illusion, yeahhh

The needle along the spinning wheel
Collecting silver coil
It gathers heat without you,
Whether or not you're turned from it
It's a quick turn
To let it figure out

It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again

The bodies lying in the sand,
They're moving in the dark
It is so quick to let us,
We feel it move through our skin
It's a sickness, a manic weakness, yeahhh

It is happening again...

// Norway //

We were sleeping till
You came along
With your tiny heart
You let us in the wooden house
To share in all the wealth

Don't you know it's true?
Norway-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Norway-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

Seven figures leap the hungry mouths
The beast, he comes to you
He's a hunter for a lonely heart
In the season of the sun

Don't you know it's true?
Norway-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Norway-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay

Where you thinking that you gotta run to now
With the beating of a tiny heart?
Hang on to the things that you're supposed to say
Millions of stars, they open to your fate

Norway...

// Walk In The Park //

You go for a walk in the park 'cause you don't need anything
Your hand that you sometimes hold doesn't do anything
The face that you see in the door isn't standing there anymore

In a matter of time, it would slip from my mind
In and out of my life, you would slip from my mind
In a matter of time

The face that you saw in the door isn't looking at you anymore
The name that you call in its place isn't waiting for your embrace
The world that you love to behold cannot hold you anymore

In a matter of time, it would slip from my mind
In and out of my life, you would slip from my mind
In a matter of time

More, you want more
More, you want more
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more, you tell me
More, only time can run me
More, you want more, you tell me

// Used To Be //

You are coming home, are you still alone, are you not the same as you used to be?
As the sun grows high and you serve your time, does each day just feel like another lie?
Now you know, is it just for show, just a foolish game that you hide behind?
Don't forget the nights when it all felt right, are you not the same as you used to be?
Used to be

In an endless night, could you feel the fright of an age that was and could never be?
So we hold it close when we feel the most like a love that we could not leave behind
Turn the wheel to each way we feel til I'm lost and I cannot find you there
Don't forget the nights when it all felt right, are you not the same as you used to be?
Used to be

Coming home any day now

// Lover Of Mine //

You hear my cry, lover of mine
No tear in the eye or fear in my mind
The forest is thick and you don't recognize
We parted our lips and we reached from inside

In a wide open field we know we can feel
Awake and unreal, off to nowhere

Need more people to be satisfied
No fear of a god and prayer for the night
You come into our minds and rush through our lives
We parted our lips and reached from inside

In a wide open field we know we can feel
Awake and unreal, off to nowhere

The only thing you've got, you know you're better off without it

Youngest fire, you decide
You decide what is right

Near yet so far, isn't it?

// Better Times //

I want you to know the truth
'cause I've been around before
Though I was looking anymore

Been a fool for weeks
'cause my heart stands for nothing and your soul's too weak
Got a will that's been around for days
Goes far if you want it
It needs to behave

But then you, you come around
Big mistake

I don't want to know
We don't need a sign to know better times

Running around 'cause you beat yourself up
And you made a crack and the one that you love is gone
How much longer can you play with fire before you turn into a liar?

I've been around before
Thought you weren't looking anymore
But then we, we come and go, go up in smoke

I don't want to know
We don't need a sign to know better times

// 10 Mile Stereo //

The heart is a stone and this is a stone that we throw
Put your hand on this stone, it's the stone of a home you know
They say we will go far, but they don't know how far we'll go
With our legs on the edge and our feet on the horizon

They say we can throw far but they don't know how far we throw
With our legs on the edge, and our feet on the horizon
The heart is a stone, and this is a stone that we throw
They say we will go far, but they don't know how far we'll go

It can't be gone, we're still right here
It took so long, can't say we heard it all
Limbs parallel, we stood so long we fell
Tear a moment from the days that carry us on forever

This push and pull is the force of a wave of time
In the heat of the night, we would cry, you are not mine
They said we would go far, but they don't know how far we'd go
'cause this heart is a stone, and this is a stone that we throw

It can't be gone, we're still right here
It took so long, can't say we saw it all
Limbs parallel, we stood so long we fell
Tear a moment from the days that carry us on forever

It can't be gone, we're still right here
It took so long, can't say we felt it all
Limbs parallel, we stood so long we fell
Love's like a pantheon, it carries on forever

// Real Love //

I met you somewhere in a hell beneath the stairs
There's someone in that room that frightens you when they go boom

The color you say is black is the one you might lack
In the size of your eyes, is there a righteous prize?

I met you

There's something wrong with our hearts when they beat pure they stand apart
In the black room, the light, watch the seabird fall
Real love, it finds you somewhere with your back to it

I met you

You know, you know, we belong by the stream, to the dawn

// Take Care //

Stand beside it, we can't hide the way it makes us glow
It's no good unless it grows, feel this burning, love of mine
Deep inside the ever-spinning, tell me does it feel
It's no good unless it's real, hill sides burning
Wild-eyed turning til we're running from it

I'd take care of you if you'd ask me to
In a year or two

You say swimming in the lake we'll come across a snake
It is real and then it's fake, feel its heartbeat
Feel what you heat, far so fast it feels too late

I'd take care of you
Take care of you
That's true
