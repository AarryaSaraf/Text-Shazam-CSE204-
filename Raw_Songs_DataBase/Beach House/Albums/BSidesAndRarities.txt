// Wherever You Go //

The kind you like
To come back in
Wherever you go

No hook inside
The sea will dry
The sun's just set

The brightened lines
Stick by your side
Wherever you go

The kind you like
Have come back here
They told you so

Wherever you go
Nobody is true
The light's off

Wherever you go
Nobody is true

The kind you like
No end in sight
The rest you know

// Chariot //

A sunny day in their chariot
Were they waving back to you?

Losing touch, not that much
She was running back to you, to you
No more

But you said, "Angel's wings, time we spent"
Nobody knows how close it will come
The rite of the sands
My heart in your hands
Women chasers, the wives abide
You build a plane to take a land you divide

A sunny day in their chariot
Were they waving back to you?

The way you chased her, the cadillac
Back on the coastline with the sun on his back
Women chasers, the scarlet land
He will be taken, but they'll all love him back

A sunny day in their chariot
Were they waving back to you?

One last call
One last call

// Baby //

Baby's having such fun
Baby thinks he's the one
One and only exception
But he'll go down like the rest of them

April comes for one more May
The floor is swept, the clothes are put away
And that's a day

Have you heard the news
Baby had to choose
Now he's on the wall
Can you make a judgement call

April comes for one more May
The floor is swept, the clothes are put away
And that's a day

// Equal Mind //

A silhouette that comes to me
As your state of infinity
Even in your equal mind
You were passing through this time

Delicate with no defense
You honor what you love to no end
Perfection in the accident
Truly yours is just what I meant

Equal Mind [x3]

There is no way you could know
These waves they come and they go
In blooms they're chasing the lights
Too soon they say these goodbyes

Equal Mind [x3]

// Baseball Diamond //

You think of tomorrow
The things you'll get done
Your family's a portrait
When spaces come down
She says she will meet you when
It's quite passable
No time like the evening
The baseball diamond
Oh

You can't find your ticket
The hands in the air
So while it's a foul ball
The children won't care
She sits smiling next to you
The sun on the edge
The circle awaits the calm
When he comes to pitch
No hands like the evening
I want you to win
I feel like it's coming
The second steal in

She sits like the season
The sun washes in
A break in the clouds
No time like to win
No time like tomorrow
The baseball diamond

Playmakers waiting for the sun to come down
Playmakers waiting for the sun to come down

Playmakers waiting for the sun
Playmakers waiting for the sun

// Play The Game //

Open up your mind and let me step inside
Rest your weary head and let your heart decide
It's so easy, when you know the rules
It's so easy, all you have to do is fall in love

Play the game, ev'rybody play, play the game of love

When you're feelin' down and your resistance is low
Light another cigarette and let yourself go
This is your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world, all you have to do is fall in love

Play the game, ev'rybody play, play the game

Love runs from my head down to my toes
My love is pumping through my veins
Driving me insane

Play the game, ev'rybody play, play the game of love

This is your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free, free world, all you have to do is fall in love

Play the game, ev'rybody play, play the game of love

// The Arrangement //

You were bad before you left a good life
To chase the palm trees swaying in the light
Do you say what you mean
You are only sixteen
And it goes
And it goes

Know that you're really not a dancer
Or good at reading other people's smiles
They are two-faced in the mirror
No vacation from here
And you go
And you go

The arrangement of lies
In a party of spies
Make a good one, do it right
The arrangement of lies

Know that you're really not a dancer
Or good at reading other people's smiles
So you make a choice to leave the good life
To chase the palm trees swaying in the night
What you see in your mind
The bright side of dark light
And you go
And it goes

The arrangement of lies
In a party of spies
Make a good one, do it right
The arrangement of lies

// Saturn Song //

I was looking for a four leaf clover
White snakes play summers for that gunpowder
Out a mile, out a mile

Why give good manners
I just don't matter
Out a mile, out a mile

Why it turn backwards
Out a mile, out a mile

// Rain In Numbers //

Clouds part
She's rolling down the water
But it always rains

And we'll hold you
The rest of your life

In your lace
Were you lazy?
Always counting
A first time

She's rolling down the window
But it always rains

And we'll hold you
The rest of your life

Spend your money
Acting funny
Get yourselves
In the hallroom

She's rolling down the window
But it's always raining
But it's always raining

And we'll hold you
The rest of your life

// I Do Not Care For The Winter Sun //

Snowflakes that fall across my eyes
Cannot compare to a dark surprise
What's new becomes old, what's old is new
When I first laid my eyes on you

I do not care for the winter sun
Windows and fires or the bridge you're on
It doesn't matter
This time of year

Though darkness comes so quick in time
Shortens our days to longer nights
Build a blue fire and kneel beside
Snowflakes that fall across our eyes

It's all that matters
This time of year
It's all that matters
This time of year
