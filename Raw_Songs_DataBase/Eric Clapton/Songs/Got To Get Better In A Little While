Don't you know what is wrong with me?
Seeing things I don't want to see
Sniffing things that ain't no good for me
Going down fast, won't you say a prayer for me?

Got to get better in a little while
Got to get better in a little while
Got to get better in a little while
Got to get better in a little while
The sun is gonna shine on my guitar someday

Revolution all across the land
Just like Sly, you got to take a stand
Please don't hurt nobody, don't knock them down
Give them a helping hand to get off the ground

Got to get better in a little while
Got to get better in a little while
Got to get better in a little while
Got to get better in a little while
The sun is gonna shine on my guitar someday

Still one thing that you can do
Fall down on your knees and pray
I know the Lord's gonna answer you
Don't do it tomorrow, do it today

Got to get better in a little while
Got to get better in a little while
Got to get better in a little while
Got to get better in a little while
The sun is gonna shine on my guitar someday
