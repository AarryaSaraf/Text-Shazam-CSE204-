My love has gone behind the sun
Since she left, the darkness has begun
The smile that used to shine on me
Is nothing more than a memory

I see her face, I hear her voice
She made a move, I had no choice
But walk and cry, wipe tears with my hand
The one that carries a wedding band

And the clouds hang low
And the flowers that used to grow in my heart
Are dying now
Dying now
Dying now
