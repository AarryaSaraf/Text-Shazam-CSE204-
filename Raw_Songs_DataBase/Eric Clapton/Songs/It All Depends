So you think you are something special
I wonder why, baby, is that so?
Could it be, you are something special
Won't you tell me, girl? I'd love to know

Yes, I've seen you with your other girlfriends
I can tell they really think you're fine
And I've seen you with your other men friends
They don't know if you're a love of mine

It all depends on how you feel, baby
I've got to know just how you feel, baby
It all depends on how you feel, baby
I've got to know just how you feel, baby

It all depends on how you feel, baby
I've got to know just how you feel, baby
It all depends on how you feel, baby
I've got to know just how you feel, baby

'Cause you've taken away
The only thing I ever had
Don't you know that I love you?
Why'd you make me feel bad?
'Cause the only thing I ever loved
Was loving you

So you think you are something special
I wonder why, baby, is that so?
Could it be, you are something special
Won't you tell me, girl? I'd love to know

It all depends on how you feel, baby
I've got to know just how you feel, baby
It all depends on how you feel, baby
I've got to know just how you feel, baby

So you think you are something special?
What makes you think you are something special?
