The point on the water, there's a change in the air
A vibe in the darkness, but there's nobody there
I look for the reason, but there's nothing to see
Just a hole in my memory where my mind used to be

Tell me why can I find no relief in my heart?
I reside in a world that has fallen apart

Out of my mind, baby, show me a sign, baby
Show me a way to get back on time, please
Where do we go, baby? How will I know?
Who holds the key? Is it hidden inside of me?

But why should I worry and why do I care
When this road that I walk on is going nowhere?
I stand and I study every face in the crowd
See the fear in their eyes, they must be thinking out loud

Tell me why can I find no relief in my heart?
I reside in a world that has fallen apart

Out of my mind, baby, show me a sign, baby
Show me a way to get back on time, please
Where do we go, baby? How will I know?
Who holds the key? Is it hidden inside of me?

Scratching the surface, it all looks the same
A world full of anger with no one to blame
But who can I turn to? Who holds the key?
And who has the answer? I think it's inside of me

Tell me why can I find no relief in my heart?
I reside in a world that has fallen apart

Out of my mind, baby, show me a sign, baby
Show me a way to get back on time, please
Where do we go, baby? How will I know?
Who holds the key? Is it hidden inside of me?
