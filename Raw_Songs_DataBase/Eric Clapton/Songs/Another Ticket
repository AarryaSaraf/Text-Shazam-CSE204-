Why can't it stay like this forever?
Why does it always have to change?

Every time you think you've paid the price
Seems you've always got to pay it twice
Every time you think you're near the end
You turn around and find another ticket

Oh my love, time is running out
Oh my love, time is running out

Why must we wait until tomorrow
When we already know the score?

Every time you think you've paid the price
Seems you've always got to pay it twice
Every time you think you've got it made
Seems you're only lying in the shade

Every time you think you've run the course
Seems you've got to ride another horse
Every time you think you're near the end
You turn around and find another ticket

Oh my love, time is running out
Oh my love, time is running out

Every time you think you've paid the price
Seems you've always got to pay it twice
Every time you think you've got it made
Seems you're only lying in the shade

Every time you think you've run the course
Seems you've got to ride another horse
Every time you think you're near the end
You turn around and find another ticket

Oh my love, time is running out
Oh my love, time is running out
