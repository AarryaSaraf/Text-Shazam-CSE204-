You said you was hurting
Almost lost your mind
And the man you love
He hurts you all the time

When things go wrong
Go wrong with you
It hurts me, too

You love him more
When you should love him less
I pick up behind him
And take his mess

When things go wrong
Go wrong with you
It hurts me, too

He love another woman
And I love you
But you love him
And stick to him like glue

When things go wrong
Go wrong with you
It hurts me, too

Now you better leave him
He better put you down
Oh, I won't stand
To see you pushed around

When things go wrong
Go wrong with you
It hurts me, too
