// Something Special //

She's something special, I can't explain it
But when she's near me, I can't contain it
And just one look at her face is good enough for me

No way of knowing which way I'm going
But I can't stop it, it keeps on growing
And just one look at her face is good enough for me

She ain't too pretty, she ain't too tall
In fact she ain't too much of anything at all
I don't care what the people say
They're going to find out some sweet day

She is precious, she is charming
She is so innocent it's really disarming
And just one look at her face is good enough for me

She's something special, I can't explain it
But when she's near me, I can't contain it
And just one look at her face is good enough for me

She is precious, she is charming
She is so innocent it's really disarming
And just one look at her face is good enough for me
Is good enough for me
Is good enough for me

// Black Rose //

The dogs are howling at the midnight moon
I'm on my way to where the black rose blooms
The mountain's high, the night is cold
I feel the sunshine; a black rose grows

Together again, we're as common as sin, they say
We just walk around the stones they throw
Night after night, we steal away to where
Love don't see no colors in the shadows
Love don't see no colors in the shadows

Wind in the willows, wild and warm
Just like the woman lying here in my arms
The water's deep, cold and still
I love the feeling that black rose gives

The dogs are howling at the midnight moon
I'm on my way to where the black rose blooms
The mountain's high, the night is cold
I feel the sunshine; a black rose grows

The dogs are howling at the midnight moon
I'm on my way to where the black rose blooms
The mountain's high, the night is cold
I feel the sunshine; a black rose grows

Love don't see no colors in the shadows

// Blow Wind Blow //

When the sun rose this morning
I didn't have my baby by my side
When the sun rose this morning
I didn't have my baby by my side
I don't know where she was
I know she's out with some another guy

Don't the sun look lonesome
Shading down behind the trees?
Don't the sun look lonesome
Shading down behind the trees?
But don't your house look lonesome
When your baby's packed to leave

Blow wind, blow wind
Blow my baby back to me
Blow wind, blow wind
Blow my baby back to me
Well you know if I don't soon find them
I will be in misery

Goodbye baby
That is all I have left to say
Goodbye baby
That is all I have left to say
But you have lost your good thing
Go ahead and have your own way

// Another Ticket //

Why can't it stay like this forever?
Why does it always have to change?

Every time you think you've paid the price
Seems you've always got to pay it twice
Every time you think you're near the end
You turn around and find another ticket

Oh my love, time is running out
Oh my love, time is running out

Why must we wait until tomorrow
When we already know the score?

Every time you think you've paid the price
Seems you've always got to pay it twice
Every time you think you've got it made
Seems you're only lying in the shade

Every time you think you've run the course
Seems you've got to ride another horse
Every time you think you're near the end
You turn around and find another ticket

Oh my love, time is running out
Oh my love, time is running out

Every time you think you've paid the price
Seems you've always got to pay it twice
Every time you think you've got it made
Seems you're only lying in the shade

Every time you think you've run the course
Seems you've got to ride another horse
Every time you think you're near the end
You turn around and find another ticket

Oh my love, time is running out
Oh my love, time is running out

// Hold Me Lord //

Sixteen days in Bethlehem, peddling dope and drinking wine
Pulling women, making gigs, steering clear and doing fine
I moved on down to Galilee, trying to find a few new friends
I'm throwing aces everywhere, trying to forget the end

Hold me Lord, hold me Lord
Hold me tight, I'm slipping through
Hold me Lord, hold me Lord
Hold me tight, I beg of you

I'm cruising through Jerusalem, dust is flying everywhere
I'm dodging bullets, making time, on the level, in the square
They say you kissed your best friend's hand, they say you did it for his love
They say he died in agony, the hand fits well into the glove

Hold me Lord, hold me Lord
Hold me tight, I'm slipping through
Hold me Lord, hold me Lord
Hold me tight, I beg of you

Hold me Lord, hold me Lord
Hold me tight, I'm slipping through
Hold me Lord, hold me Lord
Hold me tight, I beg of you

Hold me Lord, hold me Lord
Hold me tight, I'm slipping through
Hold me Lord, hold me Lord
Hold me tight, I beg of you

// Floating Bridge //

Well, I never will forget that floating bridge
Lord, I never will forget that floating bridge
Lord, I never will forget that floating bridge
They tell me five minutes time underwater I was hid

I was going down and I throwed up my hands
As I was going down, I throwed up my hands
As I was going down, I throwed up my hands
Saying, "Please Lord, take me on dry land!"

Well, they carried me in the house and they laid me 'cross the bed
Well, they carried me in the house, they laid me 'cross the bed
Well, they carried me in a house, they laid me 'cross the bed
I couldn't hear nothing but muddy waters running round my head

Oh my mother often told me, "Quit playing a bum."
My mother always told me, "Quit playing a bum."
Lord, my mother always told me, "Son, quit playing a bum!
Go out somewhere and make a crumb!"

All the people on the bridge were screaming and crying
Well, all the people on the bridge were screaming and crying
All the people on the bridge stood screaming and crying
Saying, "Lord have mercy, we're doing fine"

// Catch Me If You Can //

Catch me if you can; I won't be easy to find
I got a woman at home that's driving me out of my mind
Catch me if you can; it won't be easy to do
And I'm warning you brother I won't be leaving no clues

Catch me if you can; I won't be leaving no scent
I've been running the wrong way, I think it's time that I went
Believe me, I'm a man; I ain't easy to tend
And I'm moving on out, so catch me if you can

There's no use bothering with the lost and found
You'd better find a shovel, 'cause I've gone to ground
Little girl never did pay me no mind
I guess I'll have to go and leave her behind. So

Catch me if you can; I won't be easy to find
I got a woman at home that's driving me out of my mind
Catch me if you can; it won't be easy to do
And I'm warning you brother I won't be leaving no clues

Catch me if you can; I won't be leaving no scent
I've been running the wrong way, I think it's time that I went
Believe me, I'm a man; I ain't easy to tend
And I'm moving on out, so catch me if you can

Catch me if you can; I won't be easy to find
I got a woman at home that's driving me out of my mind
Catch me if you can; it won't be easy to do
And I'm warning you brother I won't be leaving no clues
