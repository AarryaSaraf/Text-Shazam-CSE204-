// Next Time You See Her //

She's got everything a man could ever ask for
She is lovely, brighter than a morning star
She is so beautiful, portrait of a sunset
She got everything including my old car

Next time you see her, tell her that I love her
Next time you see her, tell her that I care
Next time you see her, tell her that I love her
Next time I see you, boy, you'd better beware

I'm just trying to warn you that you're bound to get hurt
I couldn't be her last love, so how could you be her first?
I want to tell you, buddy, things are bound to get rough
I know that she's only flirting, but I think that I've had enough

Next time you see her, tell her that I love her
Next time you see her, tell her that I care
Next time you see her, tell her that I love her
Next time I see you, boy, you'd better beware

And if you see her again, I will surely kill you
And if you see her again, I will surely kill you

Next time you see her, tell her that I love her
Next time you see her, tell her that I care
Next time you see her, tell her that I love her
Next time I see you, boy, you'd better beware

And if you see her again, I will surely kill you
And if you see her again, I will surely kill you

Next time you see her, tell her that I love her
Next time you see her, tell her that I care
Next time you see her, tell her that I love her
Next time I see you, boy, you'd better beware

// We're All The Way //

There's no cause to think that I won't stay
Haven't I been with you all the way?
There's no time like now to make amends
After all, we are more than friends

This could be the time for you and me
We could go wherever we should be
So don't put words between us we shouldn't say
And don't be acting halfway
When you know we're all the way

There are times when I don't see the light
I don't know if what I do is right
But when I'm wrong, it's never meant for you
So don't confuse my words with what I do

This could be the time for you and me
We could go wherever we should be
So don't put words between us we shouldn't say
And don't be acting halfway
When you know we're all the way

// The Core //

Every morning when I wake, a feeling soon begins to overtake me
Ringing in my ears resounds through my brain; it finally surrounds me
There is fire, there is life, there is passion, fever and fury
There is love and there is hate, there is longing, anger and worry

Oh, I have a flame; feel it touch my heart
And down at my core is the hottest part
I can burn without fuel

If it should become too cold, I know I can endure the frostbite
Oh, a blanket then I'll wrap around me; I keep myself so close to my side
No one then can cause me harm, just as the river runs into the sea
'Cause every day, your fire alarm is deafening the silence all around me

Oh, I have a flame; feel it touch my heart
And down at my core is the hottest part
I can burn without fuel

It is burning
It is burning

You can trust me; we can laugh. Together we can share our sorrow
I will give you secrets too, an attitude that you may borrow
Gypsy woman said to me, "One thing you must bear in your mind:
You are young and you are free, but damned if you're deceased in your own lifetime."

Oh, I have a flame; feel it touch my heart
And down at my core is the hottest part
I can burn without fuel

It is burning
It is burning

// May You Never //

May you never lay your head down without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold
May you never lose your temper, if you get hit in a barroom fight
May you never lose your woman overnight

Well, you're just like a great, strong sister to me
And I know that your love is true
And you hold no blade for to stab me in my back
I know that there's some that do

So please, won't you please, won't you bear it in mind?
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
Please, won't you please bear it in mind for me?

May you never lay your head down without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold
May you never lose your temper, if you get hit in a barroom fight
May you never lose your woman overnight

Well, you're just like a great, strong brother to me
And I know that your love is true
And you never talk dirty behind my back
I know that there's some that do

So please, won't you please, won't you bear it in mind?
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
Please, won't you please bear it in mind for me?

May you never lay your head down without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold
May you never lose your temper, if you get hit in a barroom fight
May you never lose your woman overnight

May you never lose your woman overnight
May you never lose your woman overnight

// Looking At The Rain //

Looking at the rain
Feeling the pain
Of love lost running though
My brain
Looking at the wind
Watching it spin
The leaves along the street
You win
Waiting for a line to fall
Telling you it's all a big mistake

Looking at a face
So out of place
Inside that picture frame
Of lace
Looking at the wall
Wishing you'd call
And tell me you're OK
That's all

Wishing this was all a dream
And I'd find you sleeping when I wake

Looking at the trees
So I'll at ease
From sleep that will not come
That's me
Looking at the dawn
Knowing it's wrong
Still thinking of your love
That's gone

Wishing this was all a dream
And I'd find you sleeping when I wake

Looking at the rain
Feeling the pain
Of love lost running though
My brain
Looking at the wind
Watching it spin
The leaves along the street
You win

Waiting for a line to fall
Telling you it's all a big mistake
But the words won't come
I know I'd feel the same
Looking at the rain

// Greyhound Bus //

Ridin' on a Greyhound bus
Tomorrow never seemed to gone
I hear your voice, see your face
I don't know where it's coming from

Voices on the wind, ringing in my mind
People passing by
I think they don't know why

I am everywhere you are
I need you close to me
I am everywhere you are
I need your company

Ridin' on a Greyhound bus
Fields of green pass by
It seems I'm almost there
Sunsets in the sky

Dreams I spend at night
Running through my mind
Things I like to do, things I left behind

I am everywhere you are
I need you close to me
I am everywhere you are
I need your company

I am everywhere you are
I need you close to me
I need your company
I need your company
I need your company
I need your company

// Stars, Strays and Ashtrays //

There are song you can never remember
Songs that you cannot forget
There are people always forgiving
Has heaven forgiven me yet?

Just like stars, strays and ashtrays, they called you her own
Just like stars, strays and ashtrays, they can always be found
Just like stars, strays and ashtrays, they called you her own
Just like stars, strays and ashtrays, they can always be found

Just like stars, strays and ashtrays, they called you around
Just like stars, strays and ashtrays, they can always be found
Just like stars, strays and ashtrays, they called you around
Just like stars, strays and ashtrays, they can always be found, yes!

Just like stars, strays and ashtrays, they called you around
Just like stars, strays and ashtrays, they'll never let you down
