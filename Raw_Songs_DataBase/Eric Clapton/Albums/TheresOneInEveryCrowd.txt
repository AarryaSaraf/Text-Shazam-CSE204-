// We've Been Told (Jesus Coming Soon) //

God is warning the nations
Warning them in every way
To turn away from the evil
And seek the Lord and pray

We've been told that God done warned us
Jesus coming soon
We've been told that God done warned us
Jesus coming soon

God is warning the nations
Warning them in every way
To turn away from the evil
And seek the Lord and pray

We've been told that God done warned us
Jesus coming soon
We've been told that God done warned us
Jesus coming soon

God is warning the nations
Warning them in every way
To turn away from the evil
And seek the Lord and pray

[7x]
We've been told that God done warned us
Jesus coming soon
We've been told that God done warned us
Jesus coming soon

// Swing Low Sweet Chariot //

Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home

I looked over Jordan, what do I see
Coming for to carry me home
A band of angels coming after me
Coming for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home

I looked over Jordan, what do I see
Coming for to carry me home
A band of angels coming after me
Coming for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home

I looked over Jordan, what do I see
Coming for to carry me home
A band of angels coming after me
Coming for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home

// Little Rachel //

You don't need no high IQ
To get right down and sing the blues
If you're down, here's what to do
Me and my guitar will sing for you

Oh, little Rachel, oh
Oh, little Rachel, oh
Oh, little Rachel, oh
Oh, little Rachel, oh

I got a box and an old whisk broom
We gonna rock around the room
When my guitar plays this tune
We gonna dance to the light of the moon

Oh, little Rachel, oh
Oh, little Rachel, oh
Oh, little Rachel, oh
Oh, little Rachel, oh

What you feel, that ain't no jive
The get down sound makes you feel alive

Oh, little Rachel, oh
Oh, little Rachel, oh
Oh, little Rachel, oh
Oh, little Rachel, oh

Push it, little Rachel, push it
Push it, little Rachel, push it

Pull it, little Rachel, pull it
Pull it, little Rachel, pull it

// Don't Blame Me //

Hear my story and listen well
Truth is in all that I tell
It could never have been me
I did not shoot no deputy

Mr. Grant, the deputy
Friend to my whole family
He always tell me when John Brown
Was getting ready to come around

Don't blame me
Don't blame me

I hide it all except a few seeds
And make him think I plant for me
When Mr. Grant and I know all the while
We've got enough for the whole island

Three years now we sell it in town
Under the bucket that goes down
No one knew of it but three:
Mr. Grant, Davis and me

Don't blame me
Don't blame me

I swear by God it is a plot
Davis sent me here to rot
Listen people, can't you see
Mr. Davis shot the deputy

Don't blame me
Don't blame me

Don't blame me
Don't blame me

// Singin' The Blues //

I've been working so hard
Just came home from my job
Looked down in my wallet
Good God, I've been robbed

Now where can my money be
All my hard-earned pay?
What am I going to do now?
I got my bills to pay

You got me singin' the blues
And I'm paying all my dues
You got me singin' the blues
Ain't got nothing to lose

I got to tell you I got the blues down in my pockets
People, what did I say?
Bills are gonna rob me tomorrow
Why I need my ten dollars today

You got me singin' the blues
And I'm paying all my dues
You got me singin' the blues
Ain't got nothing to lose

Ain't no way to get even
Because, you know what I mean
Every time I make me some money
Somebody's going to take it from me

You got me singin' the blues
And I'm paying all my dues
You got me singin' the blues
Ain't got nothing to lose

You got me singin' the blues
And I'm paying all my dues
You got me singin' the blues
Ain't got nothing to lose

// Pretty Blue Eyes //

Left alone to cry
While he goes out singing
And she don't see why
A wedding bell ain't ringing

Left alone to cry
While he goes out rocking
And she can't see why
It ain't her he's socking

Goodbye, pretty blue eyes
Goodbye, pretty blue eyes

Left alone to cry
Life don't seem worth living
I stand to say goodbye
Done enough forgiving

Goodbye, pretty blue eyes
Goodbye, pretty blue eyes

// High //

High upon a mountain top
Where the eagle builds his nest
I shall go wandering
Trying to put my mind at rest
And I shall never cease
Until the day I die

He was once a friend of mine
But I did not know or care
Until she said goodbye
I cried till I could hardly see
The meaning of my life
What do I do now?

High upon a mountain top
Where the eagle builds his nest
I shall go wandering
Trying to put my mind at rest
And I shall never cease
Until the day I die

// Opposites //

Night after day, day after night
White after black, black after white
Fight after peace, peace after fight
Life after death, death after life

Night after day, day after night
White after black, black after white
Fight after peace, peace after fight
Life after death, death after life

Night after day, day after night
White after black, black after white
Fight after peace, peace after fight
Life after death, death after life
