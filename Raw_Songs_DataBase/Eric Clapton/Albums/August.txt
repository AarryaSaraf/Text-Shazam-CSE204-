// It's In The Way That You Use It //

It's in the way that you use it
It comes and it goes
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know

And if you lie you will lose it
Feelings will show
So don't you ever abuse it
Don't let it go

Nobody's right until somebody's wrong
Nobody's weak until somebody's strong
No one gets lucky until luck comes along
Nobody's lonely until somebody's gone

It's in the way that you use it
It comes and it goes
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know
It's in the way that you use it
It comes and it goes
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know

And if you lie you will lose it
Feelings will show
So don't you ever abuse it
Don't let it go

I've seen dark skies, never like this
Walked on some thin ice, never like this
I've told you white lies, never like this
Looked into true eyes, never like this

It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know
It's in the way that you use it
Boy don't you know

// Run //

Love on my mind, I used to be
Living it up, fancy free
Then one night it came to an end
I met that girl and the trouble began

Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run
Whatcha gonna do to me?
Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run
Whatcha gonna do to me?

I was hooked with just one look
Easy prey, child's play
I knew this girl was no one night stand
Felt just like putty in her hands

Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run
Whatcha gonna do to me?
Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run
Whatcha gonna do to me?

Got no answers, got no cure
But one thing I know for sure:
This is the girl, she's the one
She makes it so hard for me to run

Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run
Whatcha gonna do to me?
Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run
Whatcha gonna do to me?

People tell me
You might as well face it, she's covered all the bases
You might as well face it, she's covered all the bases

Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run
Whatcha gonna do to me?
Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run
Whatcha gonna do to me?

Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run
Whatcha gonna do to me?
Something inside of me keeps on telling me to run
Whatcha gonna do to me?

// Tearing Us Apart //

You know the sun is shining; it's raining in my heart
I don't know what to do since we've been apart
Why don't you tell me, babe, what is going on?
You know I love you darling, don't want to be alone

They're tearing us apart
They're breaking up my heart
I knew it from the start:
Your friends are tearing us apart

You know I can't go on, feeling this old way
You know my heart is burning, it's burning everyday
You know I love you, baby, no one else will do
Why don't you reconsider, do what I want you to?

They're tearing us apart
They're breaking up my heart
I knew it from the start:
Your friends are tearing us apart

They're tearing us apart
They're breaking up my heart
I knew it from the start:
Your friends are tearing us apart

Your friends are tearing us apart
Tearing us apart

// Bad Influence //

You used me to get you anything you wanted
Oh, but I'm a changed man now, baby
And your other friend can get you what you want now
If I go through those same things again
I'll be worse off than I started

Oh, you're such a bad influence
Baby, you've got ways to make me do what you want
Girl, you're such a bad influence
I've got to stay away

I've been hurtin' in all of the worst kind of ways
And it's you, pretty baby
I've just got to stay away from
I won't go through those same things again
I'm so glad that we parted

Yea, you're such a bad influence
And you've got ways to make me do what you want
Girl, you're such a bad influence
I've got to stay away

Somebody please, you've got to help me break away
You know I don't like this lonely feeling
It wasn't meant to be this way
I won't go through those same things again
I'm so glad we parted

Girl, you're such a bad influence
And you have got ways to make me do what you want
Babe, you're such a bad influence
I've got to stay away from you, girl

You're such a bad influence
And I have got to stay away
You're such a bad influence
I've got to stay away from you, baby
I've got to stay away

// Walk Away //

You leave a trail of tears wherever you go
One of us will hold you, the other one won't
But I could never share your love or leave it behind
Break his heart, not mine

Do you remember tender moments we shared?
How could this true affection vanish into thin air?
He's not worth the trouble, baby; he's just a waste of your time
Oh, break his heart, not mine

Don't you walk away
You know you're gonna miss me
Don't you walk away, walk away
You're gonna miss me
You're gonna miss my love

So don't you walk away
Don't you walk away, walk away
Don't you walk away, walk away

So I'll be waiting in the backroom, baby, when you kiss him goodbye
Oh, break his heart not mine, but

Don't you walk away
You know you're gonna miss me
Don't you walk away, walk away
You're gonna miss me
You're gonna miss my love

Don't you walk away, walk away
Oh don't you walk away
I know you're gonna miss my love
Don't you walk away, walk away
Don't you walk away
You're gonna miss my love
Don't you walk away, walk away

// Hung Up On Your Love //

I was ready to take a chance
I found myself a new romance
Then you called that same old night
Always change my mind

Oh no, not again
Oh no, not again

Just when I thought it was over, you come back
And I'm hung up on your love again
Just when I thought I was free, you come back
Now I'm hung up on your love again

Just as I was doing good
You come back, just to prove you could
Things will always be the same
With me the victim of the game

Oh no, not again
Oh no, not again

Just when I thought it was over, you come back
And I'm hung up on your love again
Just when I thought I was free, you come back
Now I'm hung up on your love again

Just when I thought it was over, you come back
And I'm hung up on your love again
Just when I thought I was free, you come back
Now I'm hung up on your love again

Just when I thought it was over, you come back
And I'm hung up on your love again
Just when I thought I was free, you come back
Now I'm hung up on your love again

Just when I thought it was over, you come back
And I'm hung up on your love again
Just when I thought I was free, you come back
Now I'm hung up on your love again

// Take A Chance //

If I don't take a chance
If I don't make a move
If I don't go looking for new romance
How will I ever find my groove?

If I don't play around
How am I gonna have my fun?
If I tried to settle down
Would I be fooling anyone?

I'm out on a limb above a sea of bliss
I don't know why I feel this way
I only know I love it

And I feel so free today
You know I feel so free today
That's right, I feel so free, no matter where I go
But I feel so free today

If I don't make mistakes
If I don't play the fool
If I have to worry 'bout the heart I break
How am I ever gonna learn the rules?

I'm looking for danger inside the sweetest smile
I don't know why I feel this way
I only know I love it

If I don't take a chance
If I don't make a move
If I don't go looking for new romance
How will I ever find my groove?

If I don't take a chance
If I don't make a move
If I don't go looking for new romance
How will I ever find my groove?

// Hold On //

Deep down in the dead of night I call out your name
It seems now that nothing is right, there's nothing but pain
If only I'd told you I love you, now all I can do is

Hold on, hold on to the feeling
You've got to hold on, hold on to the feeling
I don't feel right on this sad night
Lord, I've got thistles growing in my pillow

If you could believe in me, then I could be strong
And then we could set our love free and right all these wrongs
You'll know when I touch you how much you still mean to me, baby

Hold on, hold on to the feeling
You've got to hold on, hold on to the feeling
I don't feel right on this sad night
Lord, I've got thistles growing in my pillow

Hold on, hold on

Just give me one more chance
Please give me one more chance
Don't tell me our romance is through

Hold on, hold on to the feeling
You've got to hold on, hold on to the feeling
I don't feel right on this sad night
Lord, I've got thistles growing in my pillow

Hold on, hold on to the feeling
Hold on, hold on to the feeling
You've got to hold on, hold on to the feeling
Hold on, hold on to the feeling

// Holy Mother //

Holy Mother, where are you?
Tonight I feel broken in two
I've seen the stars fall from the sky
Holy Mother, can't keep from crying

Oh, I need your help this time
Get me through this lonely night
Tell me, please, which way to turn
To find myself again

Holy Mother, hear my prayer
Somehow I know you're still there
Send me please some peace of mind
Take away this pain

I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait any longer
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait for you

Holy Mother, hear my cry
I've cursed your name a thousand times
I've felt the anger running through my soul
All I need is a hand to hold

Oh, I feel the end has come
No longer my legs will run
You know I would rather be
In your arms tonight

When my hands no longer play
My voice is still, I fade away
Holy mother, then I'll be
Lying in, safe within your arms

// Behind The Mask //

All along, had to talk about it
Like a two-edged sword, it cuts you and it stabs me
All along, knew you were a phony girl
Sit behind the mask where you control your world

Yesterday, he had you in his arms
When I'm holding you, I feel his bitter charms
I can't judge what you do to me
Camouflage the truth, indulge your fantasy

Who do you love? Is it me now?
Is it him, babe? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me, babe?
Is it him now? I don't know

There is nothing in your eyes, that's the way you cry, girl
All is grand, all is bright, you're just studying my mind
There is nothing in your eyes, that's the way you cry, girl
All is grand, all is bright, you're just studying my mind

Was I invited to your masquerade?
Well the party's over, so now take off your face
You say you love, but it's hard to see
When you're in his arms throwing rocks at me

Who do you love? Is it me now?
Is it him, babe? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me, babe?
Is it him now? I don't know

There is nothing in your eyes, that's the way you cry, girl
All is grand, all is bright, you're just studying my mind
There is nothing in your eyes, that's the way you cry, girl
All is grand, all is bright, you're just studying my mind

I walk around suffering in my gloom
When I come to you sitting in your room
The truth is news I have longed to trace
So take off the mask so I can see your face

Who do you love? Is it me now?
Is it him, babe? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me, babe?
Is it him now? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me now?
Is it him, babe? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me, babe?
Is it him now? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me now?
Is it him, babe? I don't know
Who do you love? Is it me, babe?
Is it him now? I don't know

Who do you love? Is it me, baby?
Is it him? I want to know who do you love?

// Grand Illusion //

I saw you in a dream, it hit me like a bright light
Flashing on a screen, visions of my whole life
I used to chase the moment of desire
Back to when my young heart burned like a fire

It was just nothing but a grand illusion
Heart was quicker than the eye
Nothing but a grand illusion
Legend in my own mind

I held you in my arms 'til the other side of midnight
Kept you in my mind, you got me through some long nights
Standing on the threshold of desire
Caught between the madness and the fire

It was just nothing but a grand illusion
Heart was quicker than the eye
Nothing but a grand illusion
Legend in my own mind

It was all a grand illusion
Heart was quicker than the eye
Nothing but a grand illusion
Legends in our own minds

I used to chase the moment of desire
Back to when my young heart burned like a fire

It was just a, nothing but a
It was all a grand illusion
Nothing but a grand illusion
It was all a grand illusion
Legend in my own mind
It was just a grand illusion
Nothing but a grand illusion
It was just a grand illusion
Legend in our own minds
