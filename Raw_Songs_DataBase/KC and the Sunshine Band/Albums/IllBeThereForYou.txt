Album: IllBeThereForYou

// When I Close My Eyes //

When I close my eyes
Oh, oh, yeah
Ah-ha, ah, yeah

Girl I used to play around
Never thought you would happen to me
I played a nice song and cleared the doubt
When my heart skipped a beat suddenly

I couldn't take my eyes off you
Couldn't cleave when you were touching me
And after we dance in the night all through
In my dreams you were all I could see, yeah

(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(When I close my eyes) can't stop thinking of you
(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(I close my eyes) ah, ah, yeah

I can't believe what I have found
Girl you're all that I need
Every night when the lights go down
You face is all that I see, yeah

(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(When I close my eyes) can't stop thinking of you
(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(I close my eyes) I, I could see the light, yeah

(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(When I close my eyes) can't stop thinking of you
(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes, ooh
(I close my eyes) yeah

When I close my eyes, I can see your smile
Girl I see the light in you
And when I close my eyes, I feel just like a child
Girl you give me something new

When I close my eyes, I can see your smile
Girl I see the light in you
When I close my eyes, I feel just like a child
Girl you give me something new

Girl I used to run around
Never thought you would happen to me
And late at night, when my heart starts to pound
In my dreams you were all I could see, oh

(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(When I close my eyes) I can't stop thinking of you
(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(I close my eyes) I know when I close my eyes

(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(When I close my eyes) all I see is you, yeah
(When I close my eyes) when I close my eyes
(I close my eyes) yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When I close my eyes, I can see you smile
(Oh, I see you smile)
Oh, I see the light in you
(I see the light in you, yeah)
When I close my eyes, I feel just like a child
Girl you give me something new

When I close my eyes, I can see you smile
(I can see you smile)
Girl I see the light in you
(I see the light in you, yeah)
When I close my eyes I feel just like a child
(Feel like a child)
Girl you give me something new

// I'll Be There For You (Remix) //

I'll be there for you
(I'll be there)

Telling me no secrets, baby telling me no lies
Everything about you bringing tears to my eyes
Tell you baby, if you only knew, uh
And I'll be right there for you

Standing right through all the struggle and the strife
Every single minute through the hays and the days of our life
If you only knew, uh
I'll be right there for you

Oh, if you are missing me
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you, yeah
Oh, if you are needing me
I'll be there for you
I want to, I want to
I want to be there for you

Sometimes you feel that you're down and so low
And don't know which way you're even gonna go
All you need to know is that, uh, I'll be there for you
If you stop thinking, make another day
Life just seems to be getting in the way
All you need to know is that, uh, I'll be right there for you

Oh, if you are needing me
I'll be there for you, I'll be there for you, yeah
Oh, if you are needing me
I'll be there for you
I want to, I want to
I want to be there for you

No matter how dark, no matter how deep
I don't wanna see you lose, I wanna see you win
If you ever need me uh, I'll be there for you
Anytime, anywhere, anything you need
All you have to do is just reach out for me
Uh, if you're ever in need
Uh, I'll be there for you (if you want me to)

Telling me no secrets, baby telling me no lies
Everything about you bringing tears to my eyes
Tell you baby, if you only knew, uh
And I'll be right there for you

Standing right through all the struggle and the strife
Every single minute through the hays and the days of our life
If you only knew, uh
I'll be there for you (if you want me to)

(Yes I do) I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
(Right there, right there) I'll be there for you (yeah)
(Oh, yeah) I'll be there for you
(Oh, right there, right there if you need me)
I'll be there
Right there, right there, right there
I'll be there by your side
