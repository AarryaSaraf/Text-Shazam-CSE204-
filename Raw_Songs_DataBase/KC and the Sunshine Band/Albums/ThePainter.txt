// It Happens Every Night //

Hello babe
Are you there?
Had to call you up

And hear your voice again
Living without you
Is the hardest thing I've ever had to do
And I've tried to love again
And get you out of my head
But all I get a loneliness in this empty bed

A light of cigarette
Try to read a book or watch TV
But it's no use
'Cause I lie here awake
And my hands start to shake
'Cause I can't get to sleep without you

It happens every night
The feeling comes on stronger
And I don't know why
I want you any longer

But there's something pulling
And my heart won't let it go
It's something I can't fight
You see it happens every night

When I'm alone like this at 3 a.m
I think of you and me
And how things might have been
If we knew how to give
Instead of acting like two jealous kids

It might have worked
But in spite of the pain
There's some love that remains
And it won't let me go back to sleep

It happens every night
The feeling comes on stronger
And I don't know why
I want you any longer

But there's something pulling
And my heart won't let it go
It's something I can't fight
You see it happens every night

It happens every night
The feeling comes on stronger
And I don't know why
Love you any longer

But there's something pulling
And my heart won't let it go
It's something I can't fight
You see it happens every night

It happens every night
The feeling comes on stronger
And I don't know why
Love you any longer

But there's something pulling
And my heart won't let it go
It's something I can't fight
You see it happens every night

// Go Now (Before There's Trouble) //

I've got this funny feeling
You're gonna let me down
And I see by your expression

That you've been messing around
I know that you've been lying
So take me for a clown, think about it

Go now before there's trouble (go now)
Go now before I lose my mind (I get that)
Go now before there's trouble (go now)
Go now before you make me cry

I thought I loved you dearly
Guess I was hypnotised
'Cause now I see you clearly
And I can't believe my eyes
You know what you doing
Don't leave me double-tied, think about it

Go now before there's trouble (go now)
Go now before I lose my mind (I get that)
Go now before there's trouble (go now)
Go now before you make me cry

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah!

Hey there baby
I've got to give away love when my tears are falling
You tearing me apart
All my friends are laughing at my back now baby
I should've known, that you were no good from the start
So don't ask me for no mercy
The pain don't leave my heart, think about it

Go now before there's trouble (go now)
Go now before I lose my mind (I get that)
Go now before there's trouble (go now)
Go now before you make me cry (make me cry)
Go now before there's trouble (I get that)
Go now before I lose my mind (lose my mind)
Go now before there's trouble (I get that)
Go now before I spit in your eye (get out of my life)
Go now before there's trouble (go now baby)
Go now before I lose my mind (I get that)
Go now before there's trouble (go now baby)
Go now before you make me cry

// Summer Nights //

Watching raindrops falling
Taking me back to when I saw you
In those summer nights
I've been often wondering
How could I fall into a thing that was so right?

But you appeared to me
Your love was heavenly
Hot summer memories
Taking me back, taking me back

Those summer nights, those summer nights
(Those summer nights)
You stepped out of a dream
A summer breeze, what a sensual sea
(Summer nights, those summer nights)
Cupids arrows at me cling
(Summer nights, those summer nights)

We were often running
Suddenly summer disappeared and so did you
Should have seen it coming
Nothing so good could ever last a whole life through

Now just your ghost remains
Living inside my brain
Now every time it rains
It takes me back, it takes me back

Those summer nights, those summer nights
Stepped out of a dream
A summer breeze, what a sensual sea
(Summer nights, those summer nights)
Cupids arrows at me cling
(Summer nights, those summer nights)

Now just your ghost remains
Living inside my brain
Now every time it rains
It takes me back, it takes me back

Those summer nights, those summer nights
Stepped out of a dream
A summer breeze, what a sensual sea
(Summer nights, those summer nights)
Cupid's arrows at me cling
(Summer nights, those summer nights)
(Summer nights, those summer nights, those summer nights)

Stepped out of a dream
A summer breeze, what a sensual sea
(Summer nights, those summer nights)
Cupid's arrows at me cling
(Summer nights, those summer nights, those summer nights)

Summer nights, those summer nights
(Those summer nights)
Stepped out of a dream
Summer nights, summer nights
A sensual sea
Summer nights, summer nights
