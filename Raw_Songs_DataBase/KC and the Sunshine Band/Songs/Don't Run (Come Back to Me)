Strangely as it seems
You're the one, it's not make believe
Something's wrong, you're caught again
I'm chasing you to just nowhere

(Don't run) come back to me, baby
(Don't run) I need your loving
(Don't run) turn around, turn around
(Don't run) come back to me, baby

(Don't run) come back to me, baby
(Don't run) I need your loving
(Don't run) turn around, turn around
(Don't run) come back to me

Don't go breaking our hearts
It's just not the way to start
I say I can change all that
One chance I'll prove you that

To find the love is often hard
So many times it falls apart
I know this is not the same
It's love for real, I can't explain

(Don't run) come back to me, baby
(Don't run) I need your loving
(Don't run) turn around, turn around
(Don't run) come back to me, baby

(Don't run) come back, come back to me
(Don't run) don't walk away no, no
(Don't run) I need your loving
(Don't run) come back to me, baby

(Don't run) come back, come back to me
(Don't run) you're the one, you're the one, my darling
(Don't run) don't run away from me, no
(Don't run) 'cause you know where you belong

(Don't run) come back, come back to me
(Don't run) don't walk away no, no
(Don't run) I need your loving (you're the one, you're the one, you're the one)
I need your loving
