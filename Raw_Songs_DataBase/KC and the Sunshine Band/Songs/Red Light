She's nasty
Aha, hey eh yeah

There's a red light, and it's burning in your eyes
But it's a green light, I can tell there's no disguise
There's a red light, it's a bright red light
It says you've got some good love for me tonight

Show me, all about your love
Take me, take me in your heart
Baby, never let me go
Teach me, teach me what you know

There's a red light, and it's burning in your eyes
But it's a green light, I can tell there's no disguise
There's a red light, it's a bright red light
It says you've got some good love for me tonight

Baby, that's the way we do it
Take me, never let me go
Shake it, shake it down to the floor
I love it, baby do it some more

There's a red light, and it's burning in your eyes
But it's a green light, I can tell there's no disguise
There's a red light, it's a bright red light
It says you've got some good love for me tonight

Red light, red light
Tonight, red light

Oh, there's a red light, and it's burning in your eyes
But it's a green light, I can tell there's no disguise
There's a red light, it's a bright red light
It says you've got, you've got love for me tonight

It's a red light, it's a bright red light
And it shows me, you've got love for me tonight
It's a red light, and it's burning in your eyes
But it's a green light, I can tell there's no disguise

Red light, tonight
Red light, tonight
Oh red light, tonight
It's alright
Red light, burning bright
Red light

Oh, there's a red light, and it's burning in your eyes
But it's a green light, I can tell there's no disguise
There's a red light, it's a bright red light
It says you've got, you've got love for me tonight

Tonight, tonight
I see red light
Says you've got love, for me tonight
Says you've got love
