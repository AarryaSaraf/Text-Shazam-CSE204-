We got to get that strawberry

Sway
Sway, with you there
Sway
Sway, with you there

Midnight magic's got the best of me
Sweet street music everywhere
My feet won't listen to the rest of me
It's the moonlight madness in the air
And now the time has come (time has come)
And I'm ready (I'm ready)

I'm here to sway
Sway, with you there
Sway
Sway, with you there

Join the sound of people in the street
Cyborg dancing in the night
Swing your baby and you're crazy
Cast your spell on me tonight
And now the time has come (time has come)
And I'm ready (I'm ready)

I'm here to sway
Sway, with you there
Sway
Sway, with you there

Like the music
I like the music
Play what you wanna play
Everybody sway

Sway
Sway (sway)
Sway (sway)
Everybody sway (sway)
Sway (sway) with you there
(With that magic start to, burst the beat)

Sway (sway)
Sway (sway) with you there
(Suck up dancing in the night)
Sway (sway)
Sway (sway) with you there
(My feet won't listen to me)

Sway (sway)
Sway (sway) with you there
(Swing your baby and you're crazy)
Sway (sway)
Sway (sway)
