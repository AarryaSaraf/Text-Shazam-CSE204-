Kicking it high and kicking it low
Take a little less and take a little more
Whether we drink or whether we smoke
The radio's coming on with every song
Should I stay? Should I go?
Do you not? or do you know?
Won't you give me one more try?
Kicking it baby, I can tell no lie

Come back, come back
Baby, baby come back home
Come back, come back
Bring your love and come back home
Come back, come back
Baby, baby come back home
Come back, come back
Bring your love and come back

Baby those things that I have learnt
Do I take them to my grave?
But do you forgive me, baby please
I'm down please, begging on my knees
Please baby boo, I want you
I gotta make this all up to you
Whether it's right or whether it's wrong
I bet you I can be so nice

Come back, come back
Baby, baby come back home
Come back, come back
Bring your love and come back home
Come back, come back
Baby, baby come back home
Come back, come back
Bring your love and come back

Come back, come back
Baby, baby come back home
Come back, come back
Bring your love and come back home
Come back, come back
Baby, baby come back home
Come back, come back
Bring your love and come back
