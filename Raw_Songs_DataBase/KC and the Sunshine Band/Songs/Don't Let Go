Here we are
Living our dreams
Wrapped in each other's hearts
You and me

Sufferin' loss
Look what you've done to me
You set my heart free
With your love

So don't let go
And I need you so, so much
Darling no
Don't let go
Don't let go of me

Here we are
Wrapped in each other's love
Nothing like this before
I let her go

So through our love
You brought it back to me
So soft and mellowy
Some thing you do

So don't let go
And I need you so, so much
Oh no
Don't let go

Don't let go of me
No, no
So don't let go

So don't let go
All I need is
So, so much
No don't
Don't let go
Don't let of me

Don't let go
Don't let go

So don't let go
All I need is
So, so much
No don't
Don't let go
Don't let of me

Oh, don't let go

All I need's you
So, so much
Don't let go of me
