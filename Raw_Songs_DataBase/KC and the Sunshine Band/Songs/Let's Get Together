Oh, yeah!
Yeah-eah!

Everybody is looking, we don't wanna see
Life is so much better, living in a fantasy
We all need to wake up, we've been asleep too long
Everybody, let's get together, before it's all gone

Let's get together!
Let's get together!
Let's get together!
Let's get to-gether!

Oh yeah!
Ye-ah!
Yeah-eah-eah!

People, don't we realize, don't we give a damn (damn)
Aren't we really interested in the brotherhood of men?
Has it gotten to the point, giving no return? (Yeah)
It's not too hard to get together, but we try and learn

Let's get together!
Let's get together!
Let's get together!
Let's get to-gether!

Now everybody all over, you know we need to look
'Cause history repeats itself, it's written in the book
Think about each other, help a fellow man (why not?)
Is that so hard to do? Reach out a helping hand (Yeah)

Yeah! Let's keep together!
Let's keep together!
Let's keep together!
Let's keep to-gether!

Oh yeah!
Ye-ah!
Yeah-eah-eah!

Get together now! (Together)
Who-oho! Everybody, let's get together now! (Together)
Who-oho! Everywhere, let's get together now! (Together)
Who-oho! Everybody, let's get together now! (Together)
Who-oho! Time to care, let's get together now! (Together)
Who-oho! Everybody, let's get together now! (Together)
Who-oho! Nod to keep, let's get together now! (The more we get together, together, together)
Who-oho! Everybody, let's get together now! (The more we get together, the happier we'll be)
Who-oho! Everywhere, let's get together now! (The more we get together, together, together)
(The more we get together, the happier we'll be)
(The more we get together, together, together)
(The more we get together, the happier we'll be)
(The more we get together, together, together)
(The more we get together, the happier we'll be)
