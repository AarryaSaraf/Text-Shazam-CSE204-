I was gathering all the things I had to tell you
Then I found there were more things I, I had to hide
Like lovers and tears, doubts and fears inside me, oh yeah
'Cause when you're away, I've nothing to say at all

When you're not here
Love disappears

I was thinking of the last time we lied together
Seems whenever I need you you're across the sea
Pressured by peers
Sometimes it appear you don't want me, no, no, no
'Cause when you're away, I've nothing to say at all, no, no way

When you're not here
Love disappear, ooh yeah

Frame after frame
Dream ends the same without you, oh 'cause love
'Cause when you're away, I've not much to say at all

When you're not here
Love disappears
