All I really wanna do is hold you
Spend night and days together
All I really wanna do is feel you
Spend our live this way forever

I know what I'm gonna do
Hold you close to me and me close to you
There's no doubt in my mind
I'll be there for you day and night

I'll never stop, I'll never go
I'll just keep on loving you more and more
I'll never stop, I'll never go
I'll just keep on loving you more and more

All I really wanna do is hold you
Spend night and days together
All I really wanna do is feel you
Spend our live this way forever

I know what I'm gonna do
I'll never change the way I feel about you
You'll never have to worry again
I'm gonna be 'till the very end

I'll never stop, I'll never go
I'll just keep on loving you more and more
I'll never stop, I'll never go
I'll just keep on loving you more and more

All I really wanna do is hold you
Spend night and days together
All I really wanna do is feel you
Spend our live this way forever

All I really wanna do
(All I really wanna do) Is hold you
Spend night and days together
All I really wanna do is feel you
Spend our live this way forever

All I really wanna do
All I really wanna do
All I really wanna do
All I really wanna do

All I really wanna do is hold you
Spend night and days together
All I really wanna do is feel you
