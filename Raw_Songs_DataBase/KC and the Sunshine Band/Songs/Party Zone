You got to keep on moving
Moving (party), moving (party zone)
Moving (party, party zone, party zone)

You can dance, you can swing whatever is your thing
You can touch, you can feel a fuseable healing
You can love you can hug my body you can rock
From left to the right, side side to side

Dance into the night
Can you feel it
Living it all up
Living in the party zone
Loving all night long
You got to keep on moving, moving, moving
Welcome to the party zone

Living it all up (whoa)
Living it all up (shot)
Living it all up (whoa)
Living it all up

From day to the night
The lights are up to the dance floor
Keep them bounce, spinning around to the rhythm of the sound
Feel the beat move your feet, there it takes you higher
Screaming and shout, talking about a new love you found

Dance into the night
Can you feel it
Living it all up
Living in the party zone
Loving all night long
You got to keep on moving, moving, moving
Welcome to the party zone

Living it all up (whoa)
Living it all up (shout)
Living it all up (whoa)
Living it all up (shout)

Living it all up (whoa)
Living it all up (shout)
Living it all up (whoa)
