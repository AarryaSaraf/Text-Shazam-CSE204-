I don't wanna make love if you don't babe
I don't wanna make a fool out of me
I don't want no hot conversation
I got to feel the real love in me
You're never gonna make a fool out of me

Ha ha ha
You try to break my heart
You tease me to the limit
And leave me in the dark
Who who who
Who do you think you are?
You don't go all the way
You only go so far

I don't wanna make love if you don't babe
I don't wanna make a fool out of me
Heard about your bad reputation
You're a teaser, but I won't play
If you wanna break a heart, stay away

The way you move your body
Fire in your eyes
But I don't need nobody
Trying to tell me li-i-i-i-i-ies, oh

Oh oh oh oh
No no no

I don't wanna make love if you don't babe
I don't wanna make a fool out of me
I don't need no false invitation
I gotta feel the real love in me
Oh, you're never gonna make a fool out of me

Oh, no no, I don't wanna make love if you don't babe
No, no, I don't wanna make a fool out of me

Ha ha ha
Here we are
You didn't get what you were after
I'm the one who laughs, ha ha ha

I don't wanna make love if you don't babe (no, no)
I don't wanna make a fool out of me (don't wanna)
Heard about your bad reputation (yeah)
You're a teaser and I won't play, oh, no no

I don't wanna make love if you don't (oh, no no)
I don't wanna make a fool out of me (no, no no no)
I don't wanna make, I don't wanna make love, baby, no no (don't wanna make love)
I don't wanna make a fool out of me (oh, na na na)

I don't wanna make love if you don't (oh, no no no no no)
I don't wanna make a fool out of me (no, baby)
(I don't wanna make if you don't)
Not gonna, not gonna do to me
(I don't wanna make a fool out of me)
You're not gonna make a fool out of me...
