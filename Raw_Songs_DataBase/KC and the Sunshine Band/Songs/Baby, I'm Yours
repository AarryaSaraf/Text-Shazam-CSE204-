Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours)
Until the stars fall from the sky
Yours (yours)
Until the rivers all run dry

In other words (in other words)
I'll do at die
Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours)
Until the sun no longer shine
Yours (yours)
Until the poetries run out of price

In other words (in other words)
I'll do 'til the end of times
I'm gonna stay right here by your side
Do my best to keep you satisfied
Nothing in this world can drop me away
Cause every pain you hit me say

Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
And I'll be yours (yours)
Until the mountain crumbles to the sea
Yours (yours)
Until that 2+2 = 3

In other words (in other words)
Until eternity
Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
Oh, yeah

Ohhh until the mountain (yours), mountain, oh the mountains (yours)
Crumbles to the sea (baby, I'm yours)
Oh 'til two (yours), two and two is three (yours)
Oh babe (baby, I'm yours), yeah
Oh until (yours)
Oh until (yours)
'Til eternity

Baby, I'm yours
Baby, I'm yours (yours)
Baby, I'm yours (yours)
Baby, I'm yours (baby, I'm yours)
Oh and I got, got to tell you
