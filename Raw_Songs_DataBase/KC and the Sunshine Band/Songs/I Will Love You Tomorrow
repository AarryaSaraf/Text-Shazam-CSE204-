I will love you tomorrow
I will love you all the way
I will love you tomorrow
If you'll just love me today

You're the one that I've been dreaming of
You're the one I want to give my love
Everyday I want you more and more
Baby, please, open up your door (I will love)

I will love you tomorrow
I will love you all the way
I will love you tomorrow
If you'll just love me today

When you're near me, can't you hear my heart?
Sending out the message to never part
Please, don't leave me now, I need you so
If you love me now I'll never go (I will love)

I will love you tomorrow
I will love you all the way
I will love you tomorrow
If you'll just love me today

Hey, hey, hey
Oh, today
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, today (I will love)

I will love you tomorrow
I will love you all the way
I will love you tomorrow
If you'll just love me today, hey, hey, hey

(I will love you tomorrow) Oh, today
(I will love you all the way) I will love you tomorrow
(I will love you tomorrow) If you'll just love me today
(If you'll just love me today) Oh, hey, hey!

I will love you tomorrow
I will love you all the way
I will love you tomorrow
If you'll just love me today

I will love you tomorrow
I will love you all the way
I will love you tomorrow
If you'll just love me today
