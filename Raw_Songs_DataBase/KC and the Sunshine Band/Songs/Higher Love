Take it higher (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Take it higher (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Take it higher (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Take it higher (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Let us all be happy now, let's go have some fun
Forget about our troubles and give love to everyone
Let's cling on the good times and let the good times roll
Let's go dancing, let the music take control
Let's go get it on
Let's go get it on

Take it to a higher love
Take it to a higher love
Uh
Uh (yeah)
Uh (yeah)
Uh (yeah)

Hold on this love and then never let it stop (let it stop)
Give off feeling is good and never give it stop (give it up)
Let us get ready to lose complete control
Let's go do it baby, little more, little more
Let's go get it on (let's go and get it on)
Let's go get it on (get it on, get it on)

Take it to a higher love
Take it to a higher love
(Take it higher)
(Take it higher)
(Take it higher)
(Take it higher)

(Take it higher)
(Take it higher)
(Take it higher)
(Take it higher)

(Take it higher)
(Take it higher)
(Take it higher)
(Take it higher)

Let's go get it on (let's go get it on, yeah)
Let's go get it on (get it on, get it on, get it on)

Take it to a higher love (ooh, let's take it higher)
Take it to a higher love
Take it to a higher love
Take it to a higher love
