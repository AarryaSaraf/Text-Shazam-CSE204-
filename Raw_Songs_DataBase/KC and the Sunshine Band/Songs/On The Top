The stars are bright, the mood is right
I'm getting on the top 2night
My body's hot, never stop
You know, I know you know I'm right
Ow!

When I get that feeling, I get wound up
I'm on the top
When we lay it down, I'm on the top
Gotta get that feeling

In the nighttime 'til the sun shines
With a fantasy that drives my mind
With my body heat, with my body heat
Baby, let me lay it on the line
Ow!

When I get that feeling, I get wound up
I'm on the top
When we lay it down, I'm on the top
Gotta get that feeling

When I get that feeling, my body gets hot
I'm on the top
I can't stop I need some healing
I'm wound up, huh!
I'm on the top
I feel real hot
I'm on the top
You're my job
I'm on the top
Working you hard
I'm on the top
Feel my body heat
I'm on the top
When I get that feeling...
