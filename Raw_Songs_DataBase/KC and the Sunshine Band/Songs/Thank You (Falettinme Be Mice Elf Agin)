Lookin' at the devil
Grinnin' at his gun
Things start shakin'
I begin to run

Bullets start chasin'
I begin to stop
We begin to wrestle
I was on the top

I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
Thank you for lettin' me be myself again

Stiff all in the collar
Struck me in the face
Chit-chat chatter tryin'
Stuffy in the place
Thank you for the party
But I could never stay
Many things on my mind
Words in the way

I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
Thank you for lettin' me be myself again

Dance to the music
All night long
Everyday people
Sing a simple song
Mama's so happy
Mama starts to cry
Papa still singin'
You can make it if you try (you can make it if you try)

I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
Thank you for lettin' me be myself again

Screamin' eyes of people's fear
Burning into you
Many men are missing nights
Hatin' what we do
Youth and truth are makin' love
Taken for a starter
Dying young is hard to take
Selling out is harder

Thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
Thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again

I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
I want to thank you for lettin' me be myself again
