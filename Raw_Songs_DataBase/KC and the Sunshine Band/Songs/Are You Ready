Give it up
Start me up
Don't stop
I can't get enough

It's time to make a move
Come on baby, get in the groove
Get ready, get on your mind
One, two, three, let's start

Are you ready?
Let's have a good time
Are you ready?
I want you to be mine

Body talk
No walk
Sh-sh-sh-show me
Your hot stuff

It's time to make a move
Come on baby, get in the groove
Get ready, get on your mind
One, two, three, let's start

Are you ready?

Are you ready?
Let's have a good time
Are you ready?
I want you to be mine

It's time to make a move
Come on baby, get in the groove
Get ready, get on your mind
One, two, three, let's start

Are you ready?
Let's have a good time
Are you ready?
I want you to be mine

Are you ready?
Let's have a good time
Are you ready?
I want you to be mine

Are you ready?
Let's have a good time
Are you ready?
I want you to be mine

Are you ready?
Let's have a good time
Are you ready?
I want you to be mine
