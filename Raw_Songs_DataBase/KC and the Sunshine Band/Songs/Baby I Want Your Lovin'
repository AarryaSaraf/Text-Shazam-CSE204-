Can I get it?

Baby I want your loving

Do you want mine, yeah?
Baby I want your loving
Do you want mine, darling?

Girl is there any chance of us
Ever getting together?
And sure, I know a place we can go
And have nothing but pleasure
Oh, oh, yeah, eh

Baby I want your loving
Do you want mine, honey?
Baby I want your loving
Do you want mine, honey?

I know that I'm pushing strong
How long can I go wrong?
Waiting for you to make up your mind
If what I'm asking is wrong
Oh, oh, yeah

Baby, I'm sure you want a good time
Just put your hand in mine
I'll give you good loving you'll never forget, no
If you just give me some time
Oh-oh, oh, a long time
