Come on, stand up
Stand up and shout loud
Stand up, let it all out
Stand up
Stand up and shout loud
Stand up
What's life all about?

Feels good, have a good time
Everybody let's party down
Get up, let's go
Funky to the, hate no more

Come on and stand up
Stand up and shout loud
Stand up, let it all out
Stand up
Stand up and shout loud
Stand up

Get in the groove, somebody move
Let's get on, we've got to
Dance, dance, party
Funking with the solid beat

Come on and stand up
Stand up and shout loud
Stand up, let it all out
Stand up
Stand up and shout loud
Stand up
What's life all about? Woo

Alright (stand up)
Funking 'til we're satisfied

Stand up and shout loud
Stand up, let it all out
