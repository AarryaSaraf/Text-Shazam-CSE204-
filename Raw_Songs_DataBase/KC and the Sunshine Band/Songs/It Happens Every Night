Hello babe
Are you there?
Had to call you up

And hear your voice again
Living without you
Is the hardest thing I've ever had to do
And I've tried to love again
And get you out of my head
But all I get a loneliness in this empty bed

A light of cigarette
Try to read a book or watch TV
But it's no use
'Cause I lie here awake
And my hands start to shake
'Cause I can't get to sleep without you

It happens every night
The feeling comes on stronger
And I don't know why
I want you any longer

But there's something pulling
And my heart won't let it go
It's something I can't fight
You see it happens every night

When I'm alone like this at 3 a.m
I think of you and me
And how things might have been
If we knew how to give
Instead of acting like two jealous kids

It might have worked
But in spite of the pain
There's some love that remains
And it won't let me go back to sleep

It happens every night
The feeling comes on stronger
And I don't know why
I want you any longer

But there's something pulling
And my heart won't let it go
It's something I can't fight
You see it happens every night

It happens every night
The feeling comes on stronger
And I don't know why
Love you any longer

But there's something pulling
And my heart won't let it go
It's something I can't fight
You see it happens every night

It happens every night
The feeling comes on stronger
And I don't know why
Love you any longer

But there's something pulling
And my heart won't let it go
It's something I can't fight
You see it happens every night
