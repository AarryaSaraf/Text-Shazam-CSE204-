// B.Y.O.B. (Bring Your Own Baby) //

I've been noticing
You've been hitting on every man in the room
Now you're working on mine
And it's time we did some talking, me and you
Oh yeah
I guess you didn't read an invitation, carefully
Let me tell you how the invitation reads
This party's strictly

B.Y.O.B
And that means, bring your own baby
B.Y.O.B
And that means, bring your own guy
B.Y.O.B
And that means, bring your own baby
B.Y.O.B
Don't try to take away mine

You come strutting in
Acting like your the best thing happening tonight
(La la la la la la) Oh yeah
(la la la la la la)
Well you better think again
If you think you can leave with any man that you like
(la la la la la la) Uh, uh
(la la la la la la)
My man is staying here with here
He could see he's in love with me
What you're looking for, this ain't the place to be
This party's strictly

B.Y.O.B
And that means, bring your own baby
B.Y.O.B
And that means, bring your own guy
B.Y.O.B
And that means, bring your own baby
B.Y.O.B
Don't try, to take away mine

This party is strictly

B.Y.O.B
And that means, bring your own baby
B.Y.O.B
And that means, bring your own guy

Yeah, uh uh
And that means, bring your own baby

Don't try, to take away mine
Nah nah, nah nah, nah nah
Bring your own baby
B.Y.O.B
And that means, bring your own guy

// Once In Your Life //

Content with your life
It's still very something more than you got
Go and find it
You once had a dream
Don't let it fade away
Find a love to remind you

Once in your life
Follow your heart
Whatever it takes you, no matter how far
Once in your life
Follow your star shining for you

You lived lonely days
They turn into lonely nights
You can change it if you wanted to

Once in your life (Once in your life)
Follow your heart
Whatever it takes you, no matter how far
Once in your life (Once in your life)
Follow your star shining for you
Ooh, ooh

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

With your heart it's the pleasure of you
You can fly

Once in your life

Follow your heart
Whatever it takes you, no matter how far
Once in your life (Once in your life)
Follow your star shining for you

Once in your life (Once in your life)
Follow your heart
Whatever it takes you, no matter how far
Once in your life (Once in your life)
Follow your star shining for you (Shining, shining, shining for you)

Once in your life
Follow your heart
Whatever it takes you, no matter how far (No matter how far)
Once in your life

// Shake Me Down //

Just out of high school, I was seventeen
Using mama's makeup and sister's fake I.D
Out on the dance floor where I wanted to be
With the fever going 'round, everybody say shake

My legs were moving, having so much fun
So glad I didn't wait til I was twenty-one
Livin' up the good times, we were second to none
With the fever going 'round
Everybody say shake (shake) shake me down
Shake me down
(Shake me down)

Used to be a model of agency
Now I'm a lady and I'm living out my dreams
Out on the dance floor where I'll always be
With the fever going 'round
Everybody say shake (shake), shake me down
Shake me down

Music is driving me wild
And I just want you to move my body
Let no one cramp my style
When the others shake it up
Shake, shake, shake me down, hey, hey
Shake

Just out of high school, I was seventeen
Using mama's makeup and sister's fake I.D
Out on the dance floor where I'll always be

With the fever going 'round
Everybody say shake (shake)

Shake me down, ah
Shake me down, woo, ooh, hey

And let the fever going 'round, everybody say shake me down
Let the fever going 'round
Everybody say shake (shake, shake me down)
Let the fever going 'round, everybody say shake me down
Let the fever going 'round
Everybody say shake (shake)

Music is driving me wild
And I just want you to move my body
Let no one cramp my style
When the others shake it up
Shake, shake, shake me doooown

Yeah (shake me down)

Let the fever going 'round, everybody say shake me down
Let the fever going 'round
Everybody say shake (shake me down)
Let the fever going 'round, everybody say shake me down
Let the fever going 'round
Everybody say shake (shake, shake me down)

Let the fever going 'round, everybody say shake me down
Let the fever going 'round
Everybody say shake (shake, shake me down)
Let the fever going 'round, everybody say shake me down
Let the fever going 'round
Everybody say shake (shake, shake me down)
Let the fever going 'round, everybody say shake me down

// Gotta Get Back To Love //

Gotta get back to love
Gotta get back to love
Gotta get back to love and romance

What happened to that old feelin' we knew
Remember how my lovin' eyes would dance all over you
And when you touched my hand, makin' love was the plan
Stop that clock upon the wall and turn it back where we started

Gotta get back to love like how it used to be
Oh baby, think of all the memories
Gotta get back to love
I wanna be endlessly in romance

Why can't we be like the rainbow sea
'Cause right behind the raging storm, the colors all agree
Uh, lay down beside me, boy, we'll talk about what went wrong
Take the shining from my love and let the bright light start shining

Gotta get back to love like how it used to be
Oh baby, think of all the memories
Gotta get back to love
I wanna be endlessly in romance
All that time together, we gotta make the lovin' better

We can't turn back now at following a dream
We gotta keep reachin' for that higher star
Where you gonna run to if I turn and walk away
Don't give up on me, baby, when you know, when you know there's a way
Uh, I know, I know, I know, we can make it

Gotta get back to love like how it used to be
Oh baby, think of all the memories
Gotta get back to love
I wanna be endlessly in romance

Gotta get back to love
Uh, I know, I know, I
Gotta get back to love
Like how it used to be
Gotta get back to love
I wanna be endlessly in romance with you
