Brother, hear me
I'm talking to you
There's something I've got to say
Brother, clearly
I'm speaking the truth
I know my words can't erase

All the feelings you fear inside
All the hurt you buy
The confusion then know that you're going trough

Brother, brother
Stop hurting each other
Brother, where's your soul now?
Brother to brother, we won't need each other
You're making me cry
It's hurting a little bit of you

Ooh, brother
My heart is on fire
I've yet so much of your pain
Brother, sincerely
I feel your desire
I know that you're not to blame

All the feelings you fear inside
All the hurt you buy
The confusion then know that you're going trough

Brother, brother
Stop hurting each other
Brother, where's your soul now?
Brother to brother, we won't need each other
You're making me cry
It's hurting a little bit of you

Angels, let it consume
I know the world can be cruel, yeah
Your brother should rather love you
This is a fight we can't lose

Brother, brother
Stop hurting each other
Brother, where's your soul now?
Brother to brother, we won't need each other
You're making me cry
It's hurting a little bit of you
