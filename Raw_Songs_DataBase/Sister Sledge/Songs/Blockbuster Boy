I think I'm in love
You got my soul on fire
I can't get enough, no, no, no
You got my soul on fire
So let us get down, down
You got my soul on fire
Gonna have you around
You're so bad (You're so bad, you're so bad)
And that's good

Blockbuster boy
You caused a love explosion
Blockbuster boy
You really blew my mind
Blockbuster boy
Baby, I got all my love feeling for you
My blockbuster boy
I feel so right

So let your love flow
You got my soul on fire
Come on you got to let it show
You got my soul on fire
Whatever you do
You got my soul on fire
No one does it like you
You're so bad (you're so bad, you're so bad)
And that's good

Blockbuster boy
You caused a love explosion
Blockbuster boy
You really blew my mind
Blockbuster boy
Baby, I got all my love feeling for you
My blockbuster boy
I feel so right
