Baby, this time I know
Yes you fooled around
And you fell in love
Honey, I'll tell you so
Yes you fooled around
And you fell in love

Boy, you came along
And you took my heart
Gave it quite a start
You had a love, fit like a glove
Yes, it was the perfect love
Don't get me wrong
But I've heard that song
I've seen that dance
And I've known romance
All this to say, it's a new day
I've spoken to the owl, the jig is up!

Baby, this time I know
Yes you fooled around
And you fell in love
Honey, I'll tell you so
Yes you fooled around

And you fell in love

Now, there you go
You found a toy, that brings you joy
The love I feel it still reamins
But you're not the same
I've seen the change
You've been acting strange
I feel the pain
I can't stand the strain
What can I do
I still love you
Wanting you, needing you, holding you,
Loving you

Baby, this time I know
Yes you fooled around
And you fell in love
Honey, I'll tell you so
Yes you fooled around
And you fell in love
