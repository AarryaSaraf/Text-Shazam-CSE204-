It's tearing me apart
To watch you go
Believing with my heart
And my soul
That all I ever wanted
Was loving you
I never knew you'd
Leave this way

Ooh I don't want
To say good bye

You'd think by now
I'd be fooled
I don't want to say good bye
So turn around
And walk away
Never look behind
Cause I don't want to
Say good bye

You're the only one
Deep inside
Why you want to run
And hide
Cause all I ever wanted
Was loving you
And all you've got to do is stay

Ooh I don't want
To say good bye
