Mmm, mm, mmm
Mmm-hmmm, mmm

The taxi's waiting and I've go to go
Just for the last time, let me kiss you
Please don't forget me 'cause I love you so
And every day now I will miss you

It's over (It's over)
It's over (I know it's over)
Once we were dreaming
Mmm, life had a meaning

We'll follow the sun (We'll follow the sun)
Where has it gone? (Where has it gone?)

CHORUS:
Hands full of nothing, eyes full of tears
Words I can't say going away
Days full of memories, nights full of fears
Life without you will be blue
Hands full of nothing, ways I can't go
Knowing it's true we are through
Hands full of nothing, arms full of woe
Whispering goodbye, tell me why

Tell me why
I wanna know is why, tell me why

I can't stay longer, I got to go
I don't wanna show you that I'm crying
I've lost your sweet love and that's all I know
Your lips are cold now, they're not lying

It's over (I know it's over)
It's over
Once love was growing
Ooh, your eyes were glowing
We'll follow the sun (We'll follow the sun)
Where has it gone? (Where has it gone?)

Hands full of nothing, eyes full of tears
Words I can't say going away
Days full of memories, nights full of fears
Life without you will be blue
Hands full of nothing, ways I can't go
Knowing it's true we are through
Hands full of nothing, arms full of woe
Whispering goodbye, tell me why

Hands full of nothing, eyes full of tears
Words I can't say going away
Days full of memories, nights full of fears
Life without you will be blue
Hands full of nothing, ways I can't go
Knowing it's true we are through
Hands full of nothing, arms full of woe
Whispering goodbye, tell me why
