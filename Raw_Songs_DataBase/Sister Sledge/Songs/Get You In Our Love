Night moves feel it sway
Eyes meet hear them say come closer
Don't move. Oh we'll rock you
Don't wait. Oh baby, come little closer

Just like a heartbeat
You're under my skin

There's only one way
This night's gonna end

We gonna get you in our love
Get you into our love
Gonna wrap you up we're not gonna stop
Till we fit you like a glove
Before the night is over
Gonna get you into our love

Sweet rush when we touch
Can't you feel how much we want you
Cool ocean of the night
Whispers it's alright we want you
No one before you could reach us like
This might be surrender
But we can't resist no

We gonna get you in our love
Get you into our love
Gonna wrap you up we're not gonna stop
Till we fit you like a glove
Before the night is over
Gonna get you into our love
