I know how to sing a pretty song
I can carry on talking all night long
But, when it comes to you
I don't know what to do

I guess I never knew how to love
I have to fulfill all of my dreams
My frustrations are bursting at the seams
Sometimes I don't have time
When you want to wine and dine

But, you are still the one I'm thinking of
I guess I never knew how to love
I never knew just how to love
I guess I never knew how to love
I never knew just how to love

I didn't plan to be a star
Didn't you tell me to be just what you are?
You're so important to be
These things I have to be
I guess I never knew how to love

I see you, why you want to go?
I love, but it doesn't show
I am just being myself
Can't be anybody else

But, you are still the one I'm thinking of
I just don't know how to love
I just don't know how, how to love
When it comes you
I just don't know what to do

No, no, I don't know how to love, love baby
I just don't know what to do

I guess I never knew just how to love
I guess I never knew just how to love
I guess I never knew how to love

Without you
I just don't know what to do
Without you
I just don't know what to do
Without you
I just don't know what to do
Without you
