So I'm losing you
And I know it's goodbye
I see our good love dying
And I'll be strong
You think that I'm crying
But you're wrong

Baby, it's the rain (Baby it's the rain
Nothing but the rain (Nothing but the rain)
No, no, I'm not crying (I'm not crying)

I'm smiling again (Whoa yeah)
Baby, it's the rain (Baby, it's the rain)
Nothing but the rain
It looks like I'm crying (Oh yeah)
But you're not to blame (You're not the blame)
'Cause baby, it's the rain (Baby, it's the rain)

Ooh ooh ooh ooh

I know life goes on
And I'll try to forget
I see our good
I see our good love dying
And it's so sad
But I know the tears can't
Can't keep you back

Baby, it's the rain (Baby, it's the rain)

Nothing but the rain (Nothing but the rain)
No, no, I'm not crying (Oh no)
I'm smiling again (I'm smiling)
Baby, it's the rain (It's the rain)
Nothing but the rain
It looks like I'm crying (Ooooh, ooh, ooh)
But you're not the rain (You're not to blame)
'Cause baby, it's the rain (Baby, it's the rain)

Baby, it's the rain (It's the rain)
Nothing but the rain
No, no, I'm not crying
I'm smiling again
Baby, it's the rain (Baby, it's the rain)
Nothing but the rain (Nothing but the rain)
It looks like I'm crying (It looks like I'm crying)
But you're not the rain (No, no)
'Cause baby, it's the rain (Baby, it's the rain)

It's the rain....
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do
