She gives you nothing
But you'll give your all
The harder you try
The deeper you fall
Won't be long before you find
Her love is just a waste of time
Soon you agree
You're much better loving me
(Loving me, loving me)
She's never home
Leaves you there all alone (all alone)
You hurt deep inside
'Cause life's passing you by
Won't be long before you see
Her love is only make-believe
Soon you agree
You're much better off loving me
(Loving me, loving me)
I'll gave you a new love
One you can depend on
Then you will see
How beautiful love can be
(Love can be, love can be) yeah
Mmm
Mm
Oh, won't be long before you find
Her love is just a waste of time
Soon you agree
You're much better off loving me
(Loving me, loving me)
Yeah, soon you agree
You're much better off loving me
(Loving me, loving me)
Mmm (much better off)
Ooh, I see you, oh oh (much better off)
You're much better off loving me, boy
Oooh ooh ooh
You gonna find she won't care (much better off)
