Easy Street
The sidewalk's cleaner
Easy Street
The grass is greener
Easy Street, Easy Street

I've spent some time on lonely street
Right 'crosstown that's where I used to be
When I fell by the wayside you see
I got wrapped up in me
And moved to only street
I was searching high and low
Looking for a place to go
I caught the bus of opportunity
Hopped into the front seat
And I got off on

Easy Street
The sidewalk's cleaner
Easy Street
The grass is greener
Easy Street, Easy Street

Easy Street
The sidewalk's cleaner
Easy Street
The grass is greener
Easy Street, Easy Street

Poundin' down the meanest streets
And my stomach's wonderin'
Where am I gonna get my next meal
Been handed quite a deal
My cycle's incomplete
I had corns on my feet
From the hours I walked the beat
I'd like to drop it from my memory
I found a way in me to wake the dead end

Easy Street
The sidewalk's cleaner
Easy Street
The grass is greener
Easy Street, Easy Street

Easy Street
The sidewalk's cleaner
Easy Street
The grass is greener
Easy Street, Easy Street

Easy Street
The sidewalk's cleaner
Easy Street
The grass is greener
Easy Street, Easy Street

Easy Street
The sidewalk's cleaner
Easy Street
The grass is greener
Easy Street, Easy Street

Easy Street
The sidewalk's cleaner
Easy Street
The grass is greener
Easy Street, Easy Street
