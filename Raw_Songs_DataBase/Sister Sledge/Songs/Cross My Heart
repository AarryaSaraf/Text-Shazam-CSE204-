Cross my heart, I love you
Hope to die if you walk out on me
If you ever leave
And take your love from me, boy

Can't believe (can't believe)
That you could be so cruel and mean (cruel and mean)
Leave me hangin' like a leaf on a tree
Blowing it away (blowing it away)
Don't say love is over
Before it begins

Cross my heart, I love you
Hope to die if you walk out on me
If you ever leave
And take your love from me, boy

You thought love (you thought love)
Was free and easy
Now you find (now you find)
That it's not so easy
Don't throw up your hands
And walk away (and walk away)
Let's work together
And make our love's first rate

Cross my heart, I love you
Hope to die if you walk out on me
If you ever leave
And take your love from me, boy

Don't throw up your hands
And walk away (and walk away)
Let's work together, baby
And make our love's first rate, ohhhh

Cross my heart, I love you
Hope to die, no, no
Cross my heart, baby
I love you, boy
(Hope to die)

Ohhh, ohhh, ohh yeah
Baby, baby, baby, ohh yeahhhh
Ooooh, ooooh, oooh, no, baby
Oh, oh, I love you, boy
Love you, boy
Ohh, ohh, no, don't ever leave me
Ohh, yeahh, ohhh, ohhh, ooooh
