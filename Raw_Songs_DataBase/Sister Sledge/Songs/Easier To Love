Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Won't somebody please explain
Why all the hurt and the pain?
Can't you make'em see
It's not supposed to be
All this beautiful land
See the children playing in the sand
I put to you this question
What you at tolerate destruction?
And I don't understand why

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

What more can I say
War is this game to play
Give a person a little might
Well that don't make him right
And I hope and pray
Oh please let the children play
All this killing each other
You should be loving your brother
And I don't understand why

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Let me hear you say:

(I do) I love you 

And I don't understand why

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see

Sometimes it seems that way to me
It's easier to love, don't you see
