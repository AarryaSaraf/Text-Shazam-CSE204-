If you really want me
You've got to learn to love me right
Come on tonight
If you really want me
You've got to make it right

If you really want me
You've got to learn to love me right
Come on tonight
If you really want me
You've got to make it right

So you've got me
Deep in your heart, babe
Look into my eyes
They say that you need me
You've got to peel
What you say is for real
Inside your love
Promise me to please me
Baby don't tease me

If you really want me
You've got to learn to love me right
Come on tonight
If you really want me
You've got to make it right

Say you want me
To stay by your side babe
Open up your heart
Say that you'll keep me
You've got to hold me
Inside of your love
And say you will
Never leave me
Say that you need it

If you really want me
You've got to learn to love me right
Come on tonight
If you really want me
You've got to make it right
