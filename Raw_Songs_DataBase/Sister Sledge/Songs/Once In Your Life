Content with your life
It's still very something more than you got
Go and find it
You once had a dream
Don't let it fade away
Find a love to remind you

Once in your life
Follow your heart
Whatever it takes you, no matter how far
Once in your life
Follow your star shining for you

You lived lonely days
They turn into lonely nights
You can change it if you wanted to

Once in your life (Once in your life)
Follow your heart
Whatever it takes you, no matter how far
Once in your life (Once in your life)
Follow your star shining for you
Ooh, ooh

Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh

With your heart it's the pleasure of you
You can fly

Once in your life

Follow your heart
Whatever it takes you, no matter how far
Once in your life (Once in your life)
Follow your star shining for you

Once in your life (Once in your life)
Follow your heart
Whatever it takes you, no matter how far
Once in your life (Once in your life)
Follow your star shining for you (Shining, shining, shining for you)

Once in your life
Follow your heart
Whatever it takes you, no matter how far (No matter how far)
Once in your life
