Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the
Max is where it's at
Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the
Max is where it's at

Oh, you're walkin' tall
Lookin' slick in your three-piece at 4 AM
You got a shiny ring
On your pinky with your zodiac sign
On the surface you're cool
But inside you can't count past three
But then your pretty smile
Ain't sayin' nothin' to me

Just do it to the max, 'cause the
Max is where it's at
Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the

Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the
Max is where it's at

 never, ever be born with
And remember the beautiful people
Can only relate the truth
You will shine
When folks believe in you

There's just no need in  steppin'
Steppin', steppin', steppin', steppin'

Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the
Max is where it's at
Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the
Max is where it's at
Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the
Max is where it's at
Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the
Max is where it's at
Don't do it to death
Just do it to the max, 'cause the...
