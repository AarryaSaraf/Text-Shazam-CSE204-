Oh! What is this feeling I feel?
I don't like it no, honey.

I don't know what's come over me.
I must lose control.
You see I'm a good girl.

Oh! What is this feeling I feel?
I don't like it no, honey.

I don't know what's come over me.
I must lose control of my senses.

If, then, when, I don't want you baby,
I can't stop the feeling.
It just seems to happen.

And if, then, when
I don't need you baby.
I can't help myself.
You always see through it.

I don't know what is this feeling I feel.
I don't like it no, honey.

I don't know what's come over me.
I must lose control.
You see I'm a good girl.

Oh! What is this feeling I feel?
I don't like it no, honey.

I don't know what's come over me.
I must lose control of my senses.

If, then, when, I first met you boy,
You know it'd be good.
Oh, but never like this.

And if, then, when you're so bad.
I can't hurt you, no
'Cause I'll just hurt myself.

I don't know what is this feeling I feel.
I don't like it no, honey.

I don't know what's come over me.
I must lose control.
You see I'm a good girl.

Oh! What is this feeling I feel?
I don't like it no, honey.

I don't know what's come over me.
I must lose control of my senses.

Oh! What is this feeling I feel?
I don't like it no, honey.

I don't know what's come over me.
I must lose control.
You see I'm a good girl.

Hey. Ooh. Ah.

What is this feeling I'm feeling?
I don't like it. I don't like it.
Tell me what, what's come over me.
I'm a good girl.
