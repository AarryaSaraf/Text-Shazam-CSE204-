You need somebody
Who needs somebody
I need somebody
I need someone like you

You got that new talk
You got that cool walk
I want what you got
Don't ya need somebody too?

So right
So young
So here I come

I'm feelin' the heat around the world
When the boys meet the girls
Jump to the beat around the world
When the boys meet the girls
I need somebody
You need somebody too

The girls are dancing
The boys advancing
Casual glances
I wanna dance with you

Rockin' and slammin'
Up on the bandstand
Excellent jammin'
Don't ya need somebody too

The night is young
We're havin' fun

I'm feelin' the heat all over the world
When the boys meet the girls
Passion runs deep all over the world
When the boys meet the girls
Freak out your feet all over the world
When the boys meet the girls
