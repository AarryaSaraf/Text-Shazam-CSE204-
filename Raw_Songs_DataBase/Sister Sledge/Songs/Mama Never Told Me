Mama sure made sure
Her words were fit
For justifyin'
From the kinda lyin'
That the guys were tryin'

Yeah, I sure learned a lot
But somehow she forgot
All about the guys
With the tender eyes
Who can steal your mind

Mama never told me
About the quiet man
Mama never warned me, no
Look out for the quiet man

So shy
So bashful
Just a part of the master plan
Mama never told me
Look out for the quiet man
Mama never warned me, no
Look out for the quiet man

Ooh-ooh yeah
My mama never told me

Mama did her best now
I do believe
But she forgot to tell me
That still water runs deep

Now I've fallen in
Well, so far so good
Now I ask myself
Could it be somehow
I misunderstood?

'Cos mama never told me
About the quiet man
Mama never warned me, no
Look out for the quiet man

So shy
So bashful
Just a part of the master plan
Mama never told me
Look out for the quiet man
Mama couldn't help herself
'Cos my daddy was a quiet man
