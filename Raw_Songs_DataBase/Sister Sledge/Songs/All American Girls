We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
We're all American girls
Hear what we say, know what we mean

We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
We're all American girls
Hear what we say, know what we mean

The day has finally come
We're reaching out for number one
We've worked hard all of our lives
It's a fight just to survive

You'd better get this straight
Wise up before it's too late
We're not threatened by your lies
Or your goodbyes

We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
We're all American girls
Hear what we say, know what we mean

Sometimes the struggle gets rough
You give your all, but it's not enough
A vacant job at the top
Don't let them tell you that right you're not

We're not asking to reverse
Roles so long rehearsed
Give us an equal share
That's just fair

We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
We're all American girls
Hear what we say, know what we mean

We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
We're all American girls
Hear what we say, know what we mean

All American
All American girls
All American
All American

We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
We're all American girls
Hear what we say, and know what we mean

We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
'Cause we're all American girls
Hear what we say, and know what we mean

We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
We're all American girls
Hear what we say
