Every round gets a little bit rougher
I come back just trying a little tougher
To protect our love
Gonna let nobody take it
Ain't gonna share no love
'Cause it took too long to make it, yeah, huh

Oh, every hurt sinks a little bit deeper
I come back just trying to be sweeter
To protect our love
Gonna keep that fire burning
Ain't gonna share no love

Long as if our world keeps turning

Neither one of us would care to endanger (Endanger)
Love behind a stranger (A stranger)
We knew the stakes would be high
Still we give love a try
Now I refuse to stand by
And just let it die, yeah, yeah

Every round gets a little bit rougher
I come back, hey, just trying a little tougher
To protect our love
Gonna keep that fire burning
Ain't gonna share no love
Long as if our world keeps turning
Mm, come on and sing it to me

No, no, no

Your love is right
Keeps everything hard to find, now
No, no, no
I love you
You know it's true, ah, ha
No, no, no
You love me
That's the way it's got to, got to be
No (Ooh, yeah), no, no
Uh huh, baby, yeah, yeah

We knew the stakes would be high
Still we give love a try
Now I refuse to stand by
And just let it die, yeah, yeah

Every round gets a little bit rougher
I come back just trying a little tougher

To protect our love
Gonna keep that fire burning
Ain't gonna share no love
Long as if our world keeps turning

Come on, everybody, come on
Sing, sing a little soft to me

No (Yeah, ooh, uh), no (ha), no
We've got to, got to, got to stay together now
No (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on), no (Yeah), no

Stay together, baby
