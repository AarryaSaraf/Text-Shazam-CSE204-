I like dancing
To the music
Cause it makes me feel
Real, real
Makes me feel
Makes me feel good

I like dancing
To the music
Cause it makes me feel
Real, real
Makes me feel
Makes me feel good

My body is feeling free
It lets the music
Flow through me

If you feel like dancing
Feeling fine
Let your body rock
Shake it
Let the music keep time

I like dancing
To the music
Cause it makes me feel
Real, real
Makes me feel
Makes me feel good

Ooh in the music
Makes you feel good
You should get up and move
Let the music
Makes you feel good
You, you've got to groove

I like dancing
To the music
Cause it makes me feel
Real, real
Makes me feel
Makes me feel good

The rhythm is in my feet
I can't stand it
When the music
Starts to beat, no
When I feel it creeping
Up my soul
I begin to groove
Move it
Let the music take control

I like dancing
To the music
Cause it makes me feel
Real, real
Makes me feel
Makes me feel good
