Snaking Sally through the alley
He's sneaking Sally through the alley

He's sneaking Sally through the alley
Trying to keep her out of sight
He's sneaking Sally through the alley
When up pops his wife

He said, "He can't find nothing wrong with being friends
'Coz sometimes she lets me use her car"
She said, "If you can't find nothing wrong with your mind
You better find something wrong with her"

So he began to try to explain
That it just wasn't, just wasn't, just wasn't what she thought
He'd better find something to do with his time
The fact is he's just been caught
He's got no business

Sneaking Sally through the alley
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
She caught you sneaking through the alley with Sally

He's sneaking Sally through the alley
Oh, he's trying to get away, trying to get away
Trying to get away clean, yeah
He's sneaking through the alley with Sally, yeah
When up pops the queen

Trying to double talk, get himself in double talk
Catching himself in lies
Mama just looked at him as if he was crazy
Oh, she didn't even bat an eye

So he began to try to explain
That it just wasn't, just wasn't, just wasn't what she thought
He'd better find something to do with his time
The fact is he's just been caught, oh
He's got no business

Sneaking Sally through the alley
Hey, hey
Hey, hey now
She caught you sneaking through the alley with Sally
Sneaking Sally through the alley, yeah
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
She caught you sneaking through the alley with Sally
Oh, she caught you sneaking through the alley with Sally
