The sun is shinin' down
There's not one cloud around
And the mornin' hits me
Where I lay
And everything is green
A perfect day, it seems
Yes, he's got everything
Goin' his way

But I've seen better days
I've seen better days
When the rain was fallin' down
And he had his lovin' arms
Wrapped around me
(Wrapped around me)
I've seen better days
(I've seen better days
I've seen better days)

The neighbors come and go
They smile and wave hello
And all the kids are out
To play
Lollipops and good times
They look so much like mine
But he has taken mine
Away

I've seen better days
I've seen better days
When the rain was fallin' down
(When the rain was fallin' down)
And he had his lovin' arms
Wrapped around me
(Wrapped around me)
I've seen, I've seen better days

(I've seen better days
I've seen better days)
When the rain was fallin' down
(When the rain was fallin' down)
And he had his lovin' arms
Wrapped around me
(I've seen better days)
I've seen better days
(I've seen better days)
