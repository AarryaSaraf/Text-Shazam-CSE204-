Wanna hold you in my arms
You're a friend to me, you're a friend to me
Wanna hold you in my arms
You're a friend to me, you're a friend to me

Hello, how have you been?
It's so nice to see you again
I've been thinkin' of ways to make you feel good
Anything you want, it's understood

'Cause you're more than a lover, you're a friend
Do or die you're still the end
And I remember it well, it was on a sunny morn'
On that day, a beautiful love was born

Wanna hold you in my arms
You're a friend to me, you're a friend to me
Wanna hold you in my arms
You're a friend to me, you're a friend to me

I need and you are there
I'm so glad to know that you care
Only for me, baby and what I need
A friend in need is truly a friend indeed

And you look in my eyes when I cry
You hold my hand, you understand
Always I know, I can depend on you
To make all of my dreams come true

Wanna hold you in my arms
You're a friend to me, you're a friend to me
Wanna hold you in my arms
You're a friend to me, you're a friend to me

All this huggin' and squeezin'
And lovin' and pleasin'
And cuddlin' and teasin'
The thought of you leavin', just forget it, boy
