I used to cry, I used to cry each night
But that was all before you came
I thought love had to hurt to turn out right
But now you're here, it's not the same, it's not the same

You fill me up, you give me love
More love than I've ever seen
You're all I've got, you're all I've got in this world
But you're all the man I need

And in the evening when the moon is high
I'll take you down and rock you slow
And in the morning when I kiss your eyes
I hold you close and won't let go, I won't let go, no

You fill me up, you give me love
More love than I've ever seen
You're all I've got, you're all I've got in this world
But you're all, all I need

You know something?
You're the most beautiful lady in the world!

I love you!
You fill me up, you give me love
More love than I've ever seen
You're all I've got, you're all I've got in this world
But you're all, all I need

Baby, baby, baby

You fill me up, you give me love
More love than I've ever seen
You're all I've got, you're all I've got in this world
But you're all the man that I need
