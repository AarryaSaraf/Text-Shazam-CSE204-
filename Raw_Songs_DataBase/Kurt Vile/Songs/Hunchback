I've got a hunchback big as a humpback whale
ain't a damn man on earth now who could cure it

In the morning I'm begging please don't make me wake it
but I've got a will, know what big as my hunchback

Floppin an flippin around like a fish on the sheet
floppin an flippin around like a fish along the sand
floppin for dead uptown like when a fish drowns outta water

Left a man neck deep in dirty wood
turned your back when he was down bound

Oh I've got a hangover make you just wanna keel over
You don't gotta stick a four-leaf clover in your pants you got no chance

In the morning I'm pleading please
but I've got a will we all know by now, big as my hunchback

To get up on top these days you gotta be a low life trick just to
slither up just like a snake upon a spiral staircase
