Wakin in the dawn of day
I gotta think about what I wanna say
Phone ringin off the shelf
I guess he wanted to kill himself
Wakin on a pretty day
Don't know why I ever go away
It's hard to explain
My love in this daze

You can say I've been most all around
But honey I ain't goin nowhere
Don't worry bout a thing
It's only dying
I love along a straight line
Nothin always comes to mind
To be frank, I'm fried
But I don't mind

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Been diggin
Layin low, low, low
I'm diggin
Layin low, low, low
Dig, dig in
To these lives that we are livin
Livin low
Lackadaisically so

Risin at the crack of dawn
I gotta think about what wisecrack
I'm gonna drop along the way today
Phone ringin off the shelf
I guess somebody got somethin they
Really wanna prove to us today

Wakin on a pretty day
For any place
No use sayin nothin
To explain it
To my loved ones today
