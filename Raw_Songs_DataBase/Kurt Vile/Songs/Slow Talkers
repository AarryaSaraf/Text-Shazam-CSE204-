Everyone I know
Talks to me way too slow
I lose track what they say
Before they walk away

I told you once before
Ain't gonna say no more
Next time you come clothed in inquisitive suits
I'll consider myself mute

You're on my mind most times
When fear does not overflow
When that cranial cup runneth over
With things I despise over and over
My chalice of skin, bones, and blood
Pouring forth like the flood
