In the mornin', I'm not done sleepin'
In the evening, I guess I'm alive
It's alright, can still peel myself off sleepwalking
In a ghost town

Think I'll never leave my couch again
'Cause when I'm out, I'm only on my mind
And then again I guess it ain't always that way

In the mornin' I'm not done sleepin'
In the evening I guess I'm alive
It's alright, could still peel myself off sleepwalking
In a ghost town

Think I'll never leave my couch again
'Cause when I'm out, I'm only on my mind

Christ was born, I was there
You know me, I'm a ram
I got friends, well, wait where was I?
Well, I am tryin'

When I'm drivin'
I find on dreamin', dreamin' two's and drifting
It's just these towns, I wanna pull over, open up and stay
And rain drops might fall on my hair sometimes
But I don't pay 'em any mind

Christ was here, you just missed Him
Now I'm out, goin' down second
To all the stores to see my friend
If I can't survive oceans

When I'm drinkin' I get to joke and
And I'm laughing, falling down
But that's just fine and I just pick myself up
And walk down ghost town

Rain drops might fall on my hair sometimes
But I don't pay 'em any mind
Then again I guess it ain't always that way
