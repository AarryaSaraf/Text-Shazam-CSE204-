I got a freeway in mind, let go of my head
Walk down my line, better be sure you'll be dead
I got a trumpet, I know where to dump it
I'm glad that you came if the sound is the same

Sometimes my reckless ways, shock my self system for days
Now I'm channelling my faze in an anacin haze
But it ain't gonna do me in, I know when to dump it
A hole in my way again, I'll surely just jump it

There was a kid in a tree among the birds and the bees
Between bee hive and bird nest and I think you know the rest
He wanted to be free with them but they weren't believing
Pecking and stinging him till he wasn't breathing
But it ain't gonna do him in, he'll just go to heaven
Not done just a dreamer of ten or eleven

I've got a freeway in mind, let go of my head
Walk down my line, better be sure you'll be dead
I got a trumpet, I know where to dump it
