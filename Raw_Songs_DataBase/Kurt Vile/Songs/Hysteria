Don't you know I never knew you
But I, but I think I love you girl and
What's your name?
Boy you know the devil's in the details
Oh girl you gave me 
And I don't mean maybe

Don't you know I never knew you
But I, but I think I love you girl and
What's your name?
Boy you know the devil's in the details
Oh girl you gave me 
And I don't mean maybe

Took a drink of head dream smoothie
All of a sudden I'm feeling very loopy
Don't you know I really love you now

Stop this plane cause I wanna get off
Pull over somewhere on the side of a cloud
Watch me get out yeah
Watch me go, down
And the rest is hysteria
And I stole that
But  will get me now

Stop this plane cause I wanna get off
Pull over somewhere on the side of a cloud
Watch me get out yeah
Watch me go, down
And the rest is hysteria
And I stole that
But  will get me now

Don't you know I never knew you
But I, but I think I love you girl and
What's your name?
Boy you know the devil's in the details, just like
But  will get me now
