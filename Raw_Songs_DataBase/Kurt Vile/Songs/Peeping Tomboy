I wanna change but I don't wanna stay the same
I wanna go but I'm running
I wanna work but I don't wanna sit around
All day frowning

I wanna give up but I kinda wanna lie down
But not sleep, just rest
Give me a break, how much does it really take
Get my head out of here

I've been searching, I don't know what for
I came across some girl, she was a tomboy
And I was a peeping tom on that scene
I was a peeping Tom, you know what I mean
I was a, I was a, I was a, I was a

I wanna go but it's a one-way street with me
So I've been told and I'm goin'
When I'm down, I would never come around
But you should be kind and read my mind

I've been searching, I don't know what for
She was a tomboy and I admired her
'Cause I was a peeping Tom on that scene
I was a peeping tom, you know what I mean
I was a, I was a, I was a, I was a

I wanna change but I don't wanna stay the same
I wanna go but I'm running
I wanna work but I don't wanna sit around
All day frowning
