Yo, lemonade, my girl, what it is?
Gleamin' in the sun you're the one, you're the one, you're the one
Hey like a child you walked into my life
Hey like a mild high I'm feelin fine

Feelin' on the climb till I slide back down
From out of the sun you spun me around and around
Hey like a child you waltzed into my life
Hey like a mild high, I'm feelin' fine

In a dream I drew my blueprint
Thought I'd better get a load of the way that I do this

In the mornin' time the glorious spring
Feel I got a handle on everything
Wait for the words to form on the line

Hey like a mild high I'm feelin fine
Hey like a child you shine into my life
Hey when I'm flyin I'm high as hell on love

In a dream I drew my blueprint
Thought I'd better get a load of the way that I do this

Feelin' on the climb till I slide back down
From out of the maze you spun me the world back around
Yo, lemonade, my girl, what it is?
Reach for your hand through the sun, through the sun, through the sun

Hey like a ray you shine into my life
Hey like a cure for all things under the sun
In a dream I drew my blueprint
And it was you on every page that I drew there

Hey like a ray you shine into my life
Hey like a cure for all things under the sun
In a dream I drew my blueprint
And it was you on every page that I drew there
