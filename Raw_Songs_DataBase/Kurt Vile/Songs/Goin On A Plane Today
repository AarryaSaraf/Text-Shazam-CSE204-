Goin' on a plane today
Gonna chug a beer and curse my name
See you on the other side
Either on the tarmac or the after life

Things gettin' a little weird
My mind gone foggy, my memory's unclear
Manhood compromised
Watch me shrinkin' back into a little kid
Just as I'm just gettin' old

Goin' on a plane today

Listenin' to "Heart of Gold"
Gonna open up for Neil Young
Man, life can sure be fun
Imagine if I knew this when I was young
Too

As well
