Stuffed leopard on a windowsill
It's a just a toy, just a toy
I'm playin' Candy's Room
"She knows I wanna be Candy's boy"

I've been drivin' all day and night inside my mind
And inside I'm 'a stay for awhile
Yeah

For a while
While
While
While
For a while

There he goes again
Watch him go

Dream police in the marketplace
Turnin' my eyes so blurry
Wake up, turn 'em back on and refocus
And I'm just in the same place again

Song for my Father was ripped off for Ricky Don't Lose
"Aw, Ricky"
And these chords here: who was the first to play 'em?
Well, who could say? Who could say?

Who's to say?
Say
Say
Say
Say
Who's to say?
There he goes again
He's my friend
(Say)
(Who is to say?)
Who is to say?
