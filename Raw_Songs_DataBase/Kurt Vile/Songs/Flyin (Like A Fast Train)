Check now hey is this yep

Flyin' like a fast train, I don't feel a thing
'Til when I pull into my station, I just crash n' burn (Yeah)

Playing in the music room in my underwear
Feeling fine and then my psyche crumble, pell-mell, stumble
I been bamboozled (Better watch out we got vampires lurkin')

Flyin' like a fast train, I don't feel a thing
'Til when I pull into my station, I just crash n' burn

Flyin', acid flashback, flyin' saucers, black coffee
Pink lemonade from the faucet, seein' dragons
But they're so pretty, baby, come on let's go tear up the city
Naw, think we better slow it down

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(La, la, la)

Flyin' like a fast train, I don't feel a thing
'Til when I pull into my station, I just crash n' burn, oh

Cooped up creature of discomfort can't touch a thing
So I take a walk 'round the block then I come back and sing
Say, what's wearing you down, kid?
Well, try a little, lot of everything

Flyin' like a fast train, I don't feel a thing
'Til when I pull into my station, I just crash n' burn

(Mm, mm, mm, mm)

Flyin' like a fast train, I don't feel a thing
'Til when I pull into my station, I just crash n' burn
