I wanted everything , but I think that I only got most of it
I wanted everything , but I think that I only got most of it
I wanted everything , but I think that I only got most of it


Lord willing and if the creek don't rise
I'm gonna love ya all the time
I ain't never gonna go to work no more
Kickin and screamin and
alright, I'm goin out the door

I wanted everything , but I think that I only got most of it
I wanted everything , but I think that I only got most of it
I wanted everything , but I think that I only got most of it


Lord willing and if the creek don't rise
I'm gonna sit around til I get wise
I ain't never goin to go work no more
Cos I was an old man and that's all I ever did

I wanted everything , but I think that I only got most of it
I wanted everything , but I think that I only got most of it
I wanted everything , but I think that I only got most of it
