Yeah, I know I got religion
It took me away
It took me away
Yeah, relocating my caddy to the golden highway

Getting myself all cracked up on the poppy and pills
Cranberry orange vodka spills
But I can see those distant hills
And this is where I want to be
With human of her craft is made
Now everything I see like Jesus drafted me

Yeah, I dropped myself a penny off the william penn's head
Yeah, I watched the fall off the city hall
Yeah, I get my pictures  in seventy-six

Friends of the mind in a jar of the psychedelical kind
I won't be kind, I won't rewind
The friends that I had played too cool, I cut them off from the fire
Now I stopped using picks and not a thing between me and my guitar
Now I'm strumming away
Everyday when I feel blue I write a strummer for you
You yourself have said we can't get an ahead
But I said that you have won if we got religion
Religion, it's got me in its sway
It's got me in its sway

Yeah I know I got religion
It took me away
It took me away
Yeah, relocating my caddy to the golden highway
