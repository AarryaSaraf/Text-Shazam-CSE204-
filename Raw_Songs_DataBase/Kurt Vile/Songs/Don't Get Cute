Don't get cute, you know I can't compute
Competing with a man in an alligator suit
Gonna slap that man looking so damn daft

But can I use you? I wanna be a success, give me my style
Back home on the range is a baby who has my eyes

Don't get cut you crazy little slut
Turing all the tricks in a 12 block radius
You may look cute but you puke all over it
Can I use you? I wanna be a success, give me my style
Back one mile back is my baby with the brown brown eyes

Don't get cute

Don't get caught you're a man not a fish
And diving face first into a frozen lake baits with another
Don't you wanna be a success? Then show me some style
Cus with you the guitar is the one thing that you really make sing
Do you wanna be a success? Mmmm yeah I wanna be a success
Can I use you? I wanna be a success, give me my style
