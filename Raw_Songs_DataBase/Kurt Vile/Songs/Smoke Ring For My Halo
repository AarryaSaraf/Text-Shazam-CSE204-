Smoke ring for my halo
Angel, demon, human
Oh, the rest have made it
Over and over

Think I could see it now
Think I could see it now
Think I could see it now
Think I could see it now

Smoke ring for my halo
Human, angel, demon
Hundreds have made it
Right under the roof of your house

Thought you could see it then
Thought you could see it then
Thought you could see it then
Thought you could see it then, yeah

Sippin' from the soda can
Exercises mind
Pacifies the land
Makes a move steady, a jilted man

I feel like layin' down
I feel like layin' down
Yeah, and I wanna do it again
Oh, what a mess I guess I'm in
