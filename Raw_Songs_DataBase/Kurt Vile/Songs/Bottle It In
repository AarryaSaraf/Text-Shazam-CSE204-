Don't tell them
That you love them
For your own sake
Naw, you better bottle it in

Don't tell them
That you love them
For your own sake
'Cause you never know
'Cause you never know when
Your heart's gonna break
And that's a chance we just can't take

You bottled it in
You bottled it in

You never got back at me when
When I most needed it
I would say I didn't mind
But you done it over and over
All the time
All the time
You better bottle it in

Don't tell them
That you love them
For your own sake
'Cause you never know when
Your heart's gonna break
And that's a chance you can't take
Don't, don't don't don't- dammit

When nobody calls you on the phone
Don't break your bones over it
You'll only leave yourself lonesome to show for it
And that's somethin' you can't have

I wanted everything but I think that I got only most of it (hello hello hello)
But I think that I, I wanted everything
Aw yeah, black tongue
 with a black and the whites of my eyes
Black tear on it down the sides
And black  the chest of my soul
And it was daytime but it was black, black outside
So you bottled it in (bottled it in)

Don't tell them
That you love them (that you love me)
For your own sake (for your own sake)
'Cause you never know when (when)
Your heart's a-gonna break
And that's a chance you just can't take (can't take, hello hello)
You bottled it in, never got back

Alright
When I most needed it
Alright
Yeah
All the time, all the
All, all the time

But I think that I only got most of it
But I think that I only got most of it
Yeah I think that I only got most of it
And I think that I
Saw a bottle of 
And I went to bed
And in the morning
I woke up with a black in the whites of my eyes
And a black tongue
Dragged down the sides
