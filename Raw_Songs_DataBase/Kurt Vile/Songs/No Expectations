So take me to the station
And put me on a train
I got no expectations
To pass through here again

Once I was a rich man
But now I am so poor
But never in my sweet short life
Have I felt like this before

Your heart is like a diamond
You throw your pearls at swine
And as I watch you leaving me
You pack my peace of mind

Our love was like the water
That splashes on a stone
Our love was like our music
It's here, and then it's gone

So take me to the airport
And put me on a plane
I got no expectations
To pass through here again
