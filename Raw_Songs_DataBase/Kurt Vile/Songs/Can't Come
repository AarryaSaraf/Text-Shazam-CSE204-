To come through for you must first include me too
And I can't come through for me
No I can't come through for. . 
Oh my honey child stole my money clout(?)
No I can't come through for it
No I can't come through for shit's greed calls
And damned if I did answer
And If that it ain't you
I can't come through for you

The words we share with our human heads
We spend all day filing it
Well thats one big pile of shit

Life was fun until I met someone
Then 4 then 3 then 2
So whats it gotta do with you?
When I was young I had everyone
Then 3 then 2 then 1
Could there never be a no one
Oh my honey child stole my money clout
No I can't come through with it
No I can't get through with it

If I ever come through hmm then why not well you
But it ain't easy like that, better take a long nap yeah
Oh money honey child stole my money clout
If I can't come through for me
I can't come through for you
