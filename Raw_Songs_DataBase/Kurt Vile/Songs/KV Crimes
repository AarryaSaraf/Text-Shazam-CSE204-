i should have known:
my heart has overgrown
"do ya risk it exploding all over?"
well you better get a load o this one
with a load on
the time has come
and i believe i've come too,
for to tell you
but somethin's always in the way

all right, what now?
that's fine, i think i'm ready
to claim what's mine,
rightfully, yeah...

crestfallen
dejected with the
east coast crutch
day dreamin, thru the dark days
club mate, on holiday
with the Moon Duo
(space partners)

all right, what now?
...the time has come
and i think i came too
bleedin, bleedin
ever so slightly, yeah...

i could have called this
saw it a mile away:
"baby, stay."
