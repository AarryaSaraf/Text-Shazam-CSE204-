You're telling me a good man is hard to find well what are you blind?
Well never mind let's try and have a good time
There was a war of independence if a man's a hindrance well you know where you've got a right to go

Better take a breather till you're better till you're breathin till you stop sweatin
Better take a breather till you stop sweatin and knit me a sweater

You're tellin me a good man is hard to find,
What was that? you better rewind
Cos there's me mama, I'm showin everybody a good time
You're always lookin for a few good men well here's one
Baby, won't get wasted on a gun

Call me old dog when I'm gone but when I'm back it's always
Oh man where ya been so long, where ya been so long
And then since then it's just been alright, a-okay
Ain't always oh man where ya been so long where ya been so long
In a world that gets me high I'm tied up in all the time
