// Over Everything //

When I'm all alone on my own by my lonesome
And there ain't a single 'nother soul around
I wanna dig into my guitar, bend a blues riff that hangs
Over everything

When I'm by myself and it's daytime cuz down-under
Or wherever it is I live when it's evening
You know I speed-read the morning news and come up with my own little song also
...too

When I step outside to a beautiful morning
Where the trees are all waggin', my hair-flag waving
The scenery ragin', my life/love cascading, and the smog hangs
Over everything

When I'm outside in a real good mood
You could almost forget 'bout all the other things
Like a big old ominous cloud in my periphery

Don't wanna talk about it
Simultaneous I shout it

When I was young I liked to hear music blarin'
And I wasn't carin' to neuter my jams with earplugs
But these days I inhabitate a high-pitched ring over things
So these days I plug 'em up

When I'm strugglin' with my songs I do the same thing too
And then I crunch 'em up in headphones, cause why wouldn't you?
You could say I hear you on several levels at high decibels
Over everything

When I'm all alone on my own by myself
And there ain't another single one around
I wanna dig into my guitar, bend a blues riff that hangs
Over everything

// Let It Go //

What time do you usually wake up?
Depends on what time I sleep
Technicolour rainbow horror
Sweet dreams

Keep on rolling on the impulse
Ignore backstage lethargy and
All those obligations lost in
Reverie

You've gotta let it go
Before it takes you over
Eastern standard open G
Transpacific malady and
Calm is more conducive to the
Remedy

Speckled sunlight on my freckles
Salty water curls my hair
Run the race at your own pace
You'll get there

What comes first - the chorus or the verse?
I'm a bit blocked at the moment
They say the more you learn the less that
You know

You've gotta let it go
Before it takes you over
You've gotta let it go
Before it takes you over
You've gotta let it go
Before it takes you over
You've gotta let it go
Before it takes you over

// Fear Is Like A Forest //

Fear is like a forest
The dark of the unknown
Love is like a promise
That you'll never be alone

Touch is like a tourist
You know when you are home
It's not that I'm a purist
It's just I'd rather be alone

Books waiting to be written
Love is waiting to be loved
Songs here, underneath my fingers
Waiting to be sung

Nothing will be written
And no-one ever will I love
No song will I be singing
If it's where I'm running off

But I know that it works
'Cause I've seen that it's true
If you just let it go
It will come back to you

It'll come back in space
It'll come back in pairs
It'll come back in ways
It'll come back 'cause it cares
Come back 'cause it cares

// Outta The Woodwork //

I was busy underwater
Seeing how long I could hold my breath
A drowning spider caught my eye and I
Had to come on up for air
Just because you're older than me
Doesn't mean you have to be so condescending
I still see the same things that you see
I'm a little shady on my history

I am normally pretty forgiving but only if you are

She's so easy

I noticed you stopped talking to me
Now you're talking to me all the time
Do you know you're no good at listening?
But you're really good at saying everything on your mind
It must be tiring trying so hard
To look like you're not really trying at all
I guess if you're afraid of aiming too high
Then you're not really gonna have too far to fall

I am normally pretty forgiving but only if you are

She's so easy

Climb aboard the wagon when it comes on through
Jump up on your horse and tell me how's the view
Look over my shoulder when I talk to you
Where's the more important person in the room?

She's so easy

// Continental Breakfast //

You won't believe what I coulda told ya
But I don't believe I've the balls to let you know
I can say that 'cause I'm a man
But I feel like a little boy... today

I cherish my intercontinental friendships
We talk it over continental breakfast
In a hotel in East Bumble-wherever
Somewhere on the sphere, around here

I cherish my intercontinental friendships
Not much very big on enemies
So I kick a can way up into the sun, man
But it falls down into a ravine
I don't mean to even think about it that way, but I do

Watchin' the waves come in at night
From my back porch stoop, porch swing swingin' on its own
See it's just an inhabitant of some holy ghost

I walk like a bruised ego along shorefront property un-owned to me
But I'm feelin' inferior on the interior don't ya see
Guarded and sentimental (and after all, its just a rental)
(Like better luck performin' telekinesis on a priestess)
You won't believe what I mighta, coulda told ya
But I wouldn't wanna leave ya trippin' out over it
OK, more-so me, but...
(Or just me)

Watchin' the waves come in at night
From my back porch stoop, porch swing swingin' on its own
See it's just an inhabitant of some holy ghost

I cherish my intercontinental friendships
We talk it over continental breakfast
In a hotel in East Bumble-wherever
Somewhere on the sphere, around here

// On Script //

On script every night
Like a well-rehearsed stage show
Wet your lips, it won't take long
To break this ode to hate and love

Wings clipped, no need to fly
What, do you think that you're special?
No reflex, it's just a bend of the elbow
I know it's getting old

Nondescript, every night
Like a well-versed get well card
Barely dressed, and I just might
Take you up on your offer, yeah

// Blue Cheese //

Chinese rock and roll
Blue cheese up your - well you know
And I'm busting out of my seams
If you know what I mean
Because I'm-a-getting f'old

I didn't mean to cough on her
Forgot to add the fabric softener
I met a girl named Tina
That girl, that girl, supplies the reeferina

So kiss me with your mouth
Girl of my dreams
I've grown these agonising eyeballs
Hanging on all the Kurtisy calls and creamin in my j...
Game genie: a million lives
Never gonna die again
It's alright

Now I'm calling the cops on you
Nanny nanny boo boo
Narcin' you out
That's very funny and pray tell
Dare say, come again?
Rather very amusing as well

So kiss me with your mouth once more
Girl in real life
And cheer up Tom Scharpling: The King
And I'm singing and singing and...
Yeah, get a load of my song

Chinese rock and roll
Blue cheese up your woo hoo!

// Peepin' Tom //

I don't want to change but I don't want to stay the same
I don't want to go but I'm running
I don't want to work but I don't want to sit around
All day frowning

I don't want to give up but I kinda want to lie down
But not sleep just rest
Give me a break, how much does it really take?
To get my head out of here

I've been searching
And I don't know what for
I came across some girl
And she was a tomboy

And I was a peeping tom
More than it seems
I was a peeping tom
You know what I mean
I was a, I was a, I was a, I was a

Now I want to go but it's a one way street with me
So I've been told and I'm going
When I'm down I would never come around
But you should be kind and read my mind

I been searching
I don't know what for
I came across some girl
And I admired her

I was a peeping tom
More than it seems
I was a peeping tom
You know what I mean
I was a, I was a, I was a, I was a

I don't want to change but I don't want to stay the same
I don't want to go but I'm running
I don't want to work but I don't want to sit around
All day frowning

// Untogether //

I was friendly with this girl
Who insisted on touching my face
She told outrages stories
I believed them 'til the endings were changing from endings before
She's not touching me anymore

Untogether
I couldn't help it, I got hard
You can try your life
But you can't save the unsaveably
Untogether

I was shipwrecked with this frog
Who was endlessly testing my faith
He made outrageous demangs
I ignored him 'til I strapped on my boat feet and surfed into shore
He's not touching me anymore

Untogether
I couldn't help it, it got hard
You can try your life
But you can't change the unchangeably
Untogether

Now the bird nest on my back
Keeps my turning and straining to see
We threw outrageous parties
We were golden
Now the bird keeps a distance and I keep my speed
Sometimes there's no poison like a dream

Untogether
I couldn't help it, it got hard
You can dry your eyes
But you can't hold the impossibly
Untogether
