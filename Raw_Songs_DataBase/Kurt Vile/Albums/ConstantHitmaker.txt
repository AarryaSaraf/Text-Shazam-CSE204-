// Freeway //

I got a freeway in mind, let go of my head
Walk down my line, better be sure you'll be dead
I got a trumpet, I know where to dump it
I'm glad that you came if the sound is the same

Sometimes my reckless ways, shock my self system for days
Now I'm channelling my faze in an anacin haze
But it ain't gonna do me in, I know when to dump it
A hole in my way again, I'll surely just jump it

There was a kid in a tree among the birds and the bees
Between bee hive and bird nest and I think you know the rest
He wanted to be free with them but they weren't believing
Pecking and stinging him till he wasn't breathing
But it ain't gonna do him in, he'll just go to heaven
Not done just a dreamer of ten or eleven

I've got a freeway in mind, let go of my head
Walk down my line, better be sure you'll be dead
I got a trumpet, I know where to dump it

// Breathin Out //

Last night I was high, I heard you say
It was my body or my brain that said my soul was dead
You can only argue with yourself for so long
Through my body or my brain I got myself insane

Hey, yeah, you got yourself all mixed up
Didn't you, yeah, didn't you, yeah?
Hey, yeah, you forgot that you gotta be
Taking in it all and breathing out slow

Last night I was high, I heard you say
It was my body or my brain that said my soul was dead
You can only argue with yourself for so long
Through my body or my brain I got myself insane

Hey, yeah, you got yourself all mixed up
Didn't you, yeah, didn't you, yeah?
Hey, yeah, you forgot that you gotta be
Taking in it all and breathing out slow

Ouch! Ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh

Last night I was high, I heard you say
It was my body or my brain that said my soul was dead
Was it action or emotion? Said we're traveling in the ocean
Oh, am I still alive? There ain't no hell or heaven

Hey, yeah, you got a little screw loose
Didn't you, yeah, didn't you, yeah?
Hey, yeah, did you forge your own signature?
No longer in the picture, there's no permanent fixture
Hey, yeah, you got yourself all mixed up
Didn't you, yeah, didn't you, yeah?
Hey, yeah, you forgot that you gotta be
Taking in it all and breathing out slow

You take in it all and breathe it out slow
You take in it all and breathe it out slow

// Space Forklift //

I see an orange shimmer on the horizon
Swallowing some airplane pulling an airflag
So gravity brought back my banana
But that orange is still millions of miles above me
I see the foreign girls colonizing college benches babe
I see their Russian burly boyfriends shining comprehensively
I see my own lonely reflection within the very girl I love
I see a zigzag embroidered above my family

So as a human tractor trailer I push forward
Into the bright but wild unknown
With gasoline up to my eyelids
But is it real? Is it real? Is it real?
Little Mitchell round my head singing and saying grace
And diesel fumes up in my personal space
Forklift mirage a foot in front of my mind
It's always me behind the controls

You can't pull the stops on a one-eyed cop
My drop, a drip, a Freudian slip
When your mind speed peels out at a hundred and three
But view 'cause even one I can see
Because you can't, you won't, you don't do nothing
You don't stay young, true
Because you can't, you won't, you don't do nothing
You don't stay young, true

Babe, I see it all the time now
In VCR's and passing cars
From VCO's through XLR's
But is it real? Is it real? Is it real?

// Slow Talkers //

Everyone I know
Talks to me way too slow
I lose track what they say
Before they walk away

I told you once before
Ain't gonna say no more
Next time you come clothed in inquisitive suits
I'll consider myself mute

You're on my mind most times
When fear does not overflow
When that cranial cup runneth over
With things I despise over and over
My chalice of skin, bones, and blood
Pouring forth like the flood

// Don't Get Cute //

Don't get cute, you know I can't compute
Competing with a man in an alligator suit
Gonna slap that man looking so damn daft

But can I use you? I wanna be a success, give me my style
Back home on the range is a baby who has my eyes

Don't get cut you crazy little slut
Turing all the tricks in a 12 block radius
You may look cute but you puke all over it
Can I use you? I wanna be a success, give me my style
Back one mile back is my baby with the brown brown eyes

Don't get cute

Don't get caught you're a man not a fish
And diving face first into a frozen lake baits with another
Don't you wanna be a success? Then show me some style
Cus with you the guitar is the one thing that you really make sing
Do you wanna be a success? Mmmm yeah I wanna be a success
Can I use you? I wanna be a success, give me my style

// Best Love //

The best kind of love is found when you're not looking
It comes and goes who plant the rose that you least expect it to
Its only true and true if you don't have to ask for it
True friends come disguised and go beyond the call of duty
Take for example
Recognize my cousin you'll see he's like a brother to me
I got a good friend that looks up for me like a father figure
Do to distant relatives
Sometimes I lay awake at night turning cus I lost my best friend
If you had a true friend I'm sorry and you know I feel for you
Me I lost someone like a doctor so its deeper than I talk to you
It makes me feel like a part of me is dead too
Take into account she's my mother
She looks to me to protect younger kin, its a family thing
Every son would fight for your sisters and brothers
Your the man of the house but Daddy's gonna stop at nothing

// Classic Rock In Spring / Freeway In Mind //

["Classic Rock In Spring"]

Hey how are ya?
You sure got a way of greeting a man
Might I add the perfect sun tan
You're riding on your yellow Schwinn
While blasting classic rock in spring
A couple of summer demons
With battery recharging
When you hear the Bob Seger song
You know I'll be long gone
Cutting all my classes
Like a hit of acid
Hey how are ya?

Like a dog on a telephone
There is nonsense sustaining
And staying on ya getting off
You find yourself much better off
Feeling a bit less softer even
But coughing up a lung and then some
Yeah, you know i got your battery recharger right here
And hey how are ya?

["Freeway In Mind"]

I got a freeway in mind, let go of my head
Walk down my line, better be sure you'll be dead
I got a trumpet, I know where to dump it
I'm glad that you came if the sound is the same

Sometimes my reckless ways, shock my self system for days
Now I'm channelling my faze in an anacin haze
But it ain't gonna do me in, I know when to dump it
A hole in my way again, I'll surely just jump it

There was a kid in a tree among the birds and the bees
Between bee hive and bird nest and I think you know the rest
He wanted to be free with them but they weren't believing
Pecking and stinging him till he wasn't breathing
But it ain't gonna do him in, he'll just go to heaven
Not done just a dreamer of ten or eleven

I've got a freeway in mind, let go of my head
Walk down my line, better be sure you'll be dead
I got a trumpet, I know where to dump it
