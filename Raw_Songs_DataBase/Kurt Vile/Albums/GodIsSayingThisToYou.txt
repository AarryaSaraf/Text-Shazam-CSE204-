Album: GodIsSayingThisToYou

// Song For John In D //

The candy ball has got a center
It's so nice and sweet
She calls my name in the winter
It's so nice and sweet
I said, "Hey boys we got a winner"
It's so nice and sweet
Sin is in my skin just like a splinter
It's so nice and sweet

// My Sympathy //

So you wanna marry me, oh you got my sympathy
In a daydream I saw my soul in a flashing neon sign
Waving to myself

So you want a baby well its got my sympathy
In a nightmare I saw myself briefcase, watch and a tie

// Red Apples //

Hey old man
How many times we gotta tell you?
Where you been so long?
We don't want none
Hey girl come one over
That'll be just fine
Two packs of red apples for the long ride home
That'll be just fine

Hey yeah

// Beach On The Moon (Recycled Lyrics) //

I got a freeway in mind, let go of my head
Walk down my line better be sure you'll be dead
You get up on top, these days you gotta a be a low-life drifter so
Slither up just like a snake upon a spiral staircase

Get your damn hands off of my land
Why don't you sock me and get off of my street
Cus I scared you out of your own shoes
Now I'm gonna tie'em together and hang'em on a wire
Til its junkies for hire
And I got a hunchback

// Can't Come //

To come through for you must first include me too
And I can't come through for me
No I can't come through for. . 
Oh my honey child stole my money clout(?)
No I can't come through for it
No I can't come through for shit's greed calls
And damned if I did answer
And If that it ain't you
I can't come through for you

The words we share with our human heads
We spend all day filing it
Well thats one big pile of shit

Life was fun until I met someone
Then 4 then 3 then 2
So whats it gotta do with you?
When I was young I had everyone
Then 3 then 2 then 1
Could there never be a no one
Oh my honey child stole my money clout
No I can't come through with it
No I can't get through with it

If I ever come through hmm then why not well you
But it ain't easy like that, better take a long nap yeah
Oh money honey child stole my money clout
If I can't come through for me
I can't come through for you

// My Best Friends (Don't Even Pass This) //

My best friends don't even pass this way again
I think I must've insulted them

I don't want you to cry
I'm just sayin goodbye
I don't want you to come
And I don't know why

I never did understand the words comin out of a man
Givin answers to questions
That I didn't ask

Count to ten and then I'm just a tool again
You wasn't never no great pretender

I can't go on like this
With a clenching fist
But nicotine is even in my dreams
We tried to school you but you just cut class
Get your head out of your ass
Heads all rainin me, thoughts takin up all my time
Eyes all aglow my baby know she blows my mind
You think that I'll just drop by
Catchin wind of all my cries
Just hearin all the weight I'm feelin

But my best friends don't even pass this way again
