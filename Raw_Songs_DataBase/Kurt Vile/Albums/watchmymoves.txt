// Goin On A Plane Today //

Goin' on a plane today
Gonna chug a beer and curse my name
See you on the other side
Either on the tarmac or the after life

Things gettin' a little weird
My mind gone foggy, my memory's unclear
Manhood compromised
Watch me shrinkin' back into a little kid
Just as I'm just gettin' old

Goin' on a plane today

Listenin' to "Heart of Gold"
Gonna open up for Neil Young
Man, life can sure be fun
Imagine if I knew this when I was young
Too

As well

// Flyin (Like A Fast Train) //

Check now hey is this yep

Flyin' like a fast train, I don't feel a thing
'Til when I pull into my station, I just crash n' burn (Yeah)

Playing in the music room in my underwear
Feeling fine and then my psyche crumble, pell-mell, stumble
I been bamboozled (Better watch out we got vampires lurkin')

Flyin' like a fast train, I don't feel a thing
'Til when I pull into my station, I just crash n' burn

Flyin', acid flashback, flyin' saucers, black coffee
Pink lemonade from the faucet, seein' dragons
But they're so pretty, baby, come on let's go tear up the city
Naw, think we better slow it down

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(La, la, la)

Flyin' like a fast train, I don't feel a thing
'Til when I pull into my station, I just crash n' burn, oh

Cooped up creature of discomfort can't touch a thing
So I take a walk 'round the block then I come back and sing
Say, what's wearing you down, kid?
Well, try a little, lot of everything

Flyin' like a fast train, I don't feel a thing
'Til when I pull into my station, I just crash n' burn

(Mm, mm, mm, mm)

Flyin' like a fast train, I don't feel a thing
'Til when I pull into my station, I just crash n' burn

// Palace Of OKV In Reverse //

Palace of OKV in reverse
Dreamin' up a storm in my soul
There's a great flood of blood
Pumpin' through to my heart
That goes out to the world

Dreamin' dreams or was it real or was it only just a dream?

Second verse same as the reverse
Was it real or was it only but a dream?
Dreamin' up a storm in my soul
There's a great flood of blood then of course, well, all the rest

Standin' on top of the world when it's startin' to burn

And that's the way that I feel with my head down on the pillow sometimes

Palace of OKV in reverse gets unbuilt
Roots pulled back down in the ground

// Like Exploding Stones //

(Got me goin'... 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2...)
Got me goin' "woo"...

Pain ricochet in my brain like exploding stones
Thoughts runnin' round in my cranium like pinball machine-a-mania
Dreamin' of a time when everything rhymed and I was cool, calm and collected
And all my heroes dropped by just to hear me play

Thoughts become pictures, become movies in my mind
Welcome to the KV horror drive in movie marathon
But I'm just kiddin' and I'm just playin'
And this is just the way that I'm makin' a living
Everyday... In my mind and in real life too

Goin' "woo"
Singin' "yeah"
Goin' "woo"
Singin' "yeah"

Goin' "woo"
Singin' "yeah"
Goin' "woo"
Singin' "yeah"

("Takin' off now...")
("Moog makin' noise now...")

Pain ricochet in my brain like exploding stones

("And guitars feedin' back now...")
("Feedback massaging my cranium")

Painful calculations bruise my brain in the pouring rain
Baby red maples growin' in the hedges
Sometimes the silver linings come in brown and red
So to see with your eyes you gotta turn your head to the light
You gotta see with your eyes to look at what's outta sight

Outta sight

(Sight)

Pain ricochet in my brain like exploding stones

Pain ricochet in my brain like exploding stones

// Mount Airy Hill (Way Gone) //

Standing on top of Mount Airy Hill
Thinkin 'bout, flyin'
Been around but now I'm gone
Been gone but now I'm goin' down

I was flyin' high through the night when the mornin' came
But I was gone, if you know, what I mean
I was around but now I'm gone
Been done down but now I'm just way down low
(Watch my moves)

He do the snake in the grass
He do the wiggle it around now, way down low
I been around but now I'm gone
Been gone but now I'm just way gone
I been around but now I'm gone
Been gone but now I'm way gone

I been around but now I'm gone (Yeah)
Been around but now I'm gone
Been gone but now I'm-a-just way gone
(Watch my moves)

He do the snake in the grass

// Hey Like A Child //

Yo, lemonade, my girl, what it is?
Gleamin' in the sun you're the one, you're the one, you're the one
Hey like a child you walked into my life
Hey like a mild high I'm feelin fine

Feelin' on the climb till I slide back down
From out of the sun you spun me around and around
Hey like a child you waltzed into my life
Hey like a mild high, I'm feelin' fine

In a dream I drew my blueprint
Thought I'd better get a load of the way that I do this

In the mornin' time the glorious spring
Feel I got a handle on everything
Wait for the words to form on the line

Hey like a mild high I'm feelin fine
Hey like a child you shine into my life
Hey when I'm flyin I'm high as hell on love

In a dream I drew my blueprint
Thought I'd better get a load of the way that I do this

Feelin' on the climb till I slide back down
From out of the maze you spun me the world back around
Yo, lemonade, my girl, what it is?
Reach for your hand through the sun, through the sun, through the sun

Hey like a ray you shine into my life
Hey like a cure for all things under the sun
In a dream I drew my blueprint
And it was you on every page that I drew there

Hey like a ray you shine into my life
Hey like a cure for all things under the sun
In a dream I drew my blueprint
And it was you on every page that I drew there

// Jesus On A Wire //

Jesus on the phone talking 'bout a nervous breakdown
Even he don't know how to bail us out of this one
"What a mess," I sing to myself thinkin' 'bout another song
I wanna reach out to old Jesus (and) tell him I, too, feel alone
And I'm here to save you

Jesus on a wire
And he's lookin' very tired
And me. I don't blame him
And I almost want to claim him

So I ring a couple chords out on my Martin Double O
And I see them floating upward and I watch 'em as they go
Into the pockets of Judas Iscariot in the sky

Up through the cracks in the ceiling

Jesus on the edge and I feel the same way lately
And he hammers down some numbers
And it shakes the sky like thunder

I saw him risin'
O'er the horizon
And I saw him fall
When the scene dissipated
And the world just waited and waited
For a return

Built

// Fo Sho //

Even if I'm wrong
Even if I'm wrong
Gonna sing-a-my song
'Til the break o' dawn like "Woo"

But even 'cause I'm real
Even 'cause I'm real
Even 'cause I'm real
Gonna peal another smash poem
Out a yellow legal pad for ya, baby
While I can

Even if it's sike
'Cause I know that I'm right
And I been doin' this a long time
Since before I was born

And it's prolly gonna be another
Prolly gonna be another long song
Prolly gonna be another long song

Even if I'm wrong
Gonna sing-a-my song
'Til the ass crack o' dawn

And it's prolly gonna be another long song
Long song
Long song
Long song

// Cool Water //

Hey, where you goin' now?
Are you goin' home?
Where is that at, baby?
I, I been thinkin'
I been drinkin'
I been dyin' and craving some

Cool water
Cool water
Just like Hank sang
Hank sang

Wait, wait your turn
And do ya got something to burn?
'Cause now, now is the time
To smoke 'em if you got 'em
But when, when you're done
Bite your tongue and put out the cherry with some

Cool water
Cool water
Just like Hank sang
Hank sang

But a Son of a Pioneer wrote

Hey, where you going now?
Are you goin' home?
Where is that at, baby?
'Cause I, I been thinkin'
And I been drinkin'
For a while
But when you're done bite your tongue and
'Cause now I could use some, we all could use some

Cool water
Cool water
Just like Hank sang
Hank sang

But a one Marty Robbins slayed with the brothers Glaser

// Chazzy Don't Mind //

Strummin' a song
That teapot wants to sing along but
I don't mind
No, I don't mind

Write about what you see around you
Children and flowers
And days for hours
Songs for miles

And I don't mind
No, I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind

My girlfriend's Chazzybelt
They got a song like this too, prolly, but
I don't mind
No, I don't mind
I don't
I don't mind

My mind is hummin'
When I walk I'm dreamin', riding skateboards downhill

Smooth hiss of brand new blacktop swells
All just from, well
I'm really just lookin' outside from inside
Leanin' on my windowsill

Strummin' a song
That teapot sings in a beautiful falsetto
And I don't mind
I don't mind
Oh, I don't mind
Oh, I don't mind

// Say The Word //

One, two, three, four

I wrote the words to this song drivin' from Philly to Amherst
I wrote the words to this song settin' still in, mm, Saskatoon
Words to this song come and go and, fly away
Words to this song how can I sing to say?

When every time I grow into a man
Chaos comin' 'round the bend

I don't know much for true but I do know the only word is love to see us through
And if I grow into a tree later well make mine be a beach wood with long limbs
'Cause times they be tremblin' so let me do some of that then in the wind
To this song 'cause how can I sing to say?
'Cause every time

They told me change takes slow, well
Watch me wiggle it around then way down low
To pull on the lever and
Watch me make a believer out of them
I wrote the words to this song
But they came out all screwed up in the
Mess of the hullabaloo
Go

I don't know much for true but I do know the only word is love to see us through
And if I grow into a tree later well

And every time I grow into a man
Chaos comin' 'round the bend
When every time I grow into a boy
Chaos comin' 'round again
And every time I grow into a boy
Chaos is comin' 'round again
When every time I grow into a

// Wages Of Sin //

When we fight, I wanna talk it out
You won't say nothin', nothin' at all
You just sit, there you won't open that pretty mouth
I think you like keeping my back up against the wall

Wages of sin you keep me payin'
Wages of sin for the wrongs that I've done and
Wages of sin you keep me payin'
Wages of sin, one by one

I walk in the apartment, there's clothes thrown all over the place
You're crouched in the corner with make-up runnin' down your face and
I don't wanna believe what my, what my heart keeps sayin'
You keep me on the line so you can keep me payin'

Wages of sin, yeah we keep payin'
Wages of sin for the wrongs that we've done and
Wages of sin, yeah we keep payin'
Wages of sin, that's how we have our fun

I remember when I was a little boy out where cottonwoods grow tall
Tryin' to make it home through the forest before the darkness falls
Baby, all the sounds I heard, even if they weren't real
I was runnin' down that broken path with the devil snappin' at my heels
And I tried so hard, so hard in every way
Swore some day I'd grow up and just throw it all away
Cried all the tears, baby, that I could cry
Stomached all my fears 'til they just rushed up inside
Darlin', I'm losing and it's a mean game
Still, I play on and on just the same

Wages of sin, yeah I keep payin'
Wages of sin for some wrongs that I've done and
Wages of sin, yeah I keep payin'
Wages of sin, one by one

// Stuffed Leopard //

Stuffed leopard on a windowsill
It's a just a toy, just a toy
I'm playin' Candy's Room
"She knows I wanna be Candy's boy"

I've been drivin' all day and night inside my mind
And inside I'm 'a stay for awhile
Yeah

For a while
While
While
While
For a while

There he goes again
Watch him go

Dream police in the marketplace
Turnin' my eyes so blurry
Wake up, turn 'em back on and refocus
And I'm just in the same place again

Song for my Father was ripped off for Ricky Don't Lose
"Aw, Ricky"
And these chords here: who was the first to play 'em?
Well, who could say? Who could say?

Who's to say?
Say
Say
Say
Say
Who's to say?
There he goes again
He's my friend
(Say)
(Who is to say?)
Who is to say?
