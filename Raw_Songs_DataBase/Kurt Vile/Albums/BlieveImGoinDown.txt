// Pretty Pimpin //

I woke up this morning
Didn't recognize the man in the mirror
Then I laughed and I said, "Oh silly me, that's just me"
Then I proceeded to brush some stranger's teeth
But they were my teeth, and I was weightless
Just quivering like some leaf come in the window of a restroom

I couldn't tell you what the hell it was supposed to mean
But it was a Monday, no a Tuesday, no Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Then Saturday came around and I said "Who's this stupid clown blocking the bathroom sink?"

All he ever wanted was to be someone in life that was just like
All I want is to just have fun
Live my life like a son of a gun
I could be one thousand miles away but still mean what I say

Then I woke up one morning
Didn't recognize the man in the mirror
Then I laughed and I said, "Oh silly me, that's just me"
Then I proceeded to not comb some stranger's hair
Never was my style

But I couldn't tell you what the hell it was supposed to mean
Because it was a Monday, no a Tuesday, no Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Then Saturday came around and I said "Who's this stupid clown blocking the bathroom sink?"
But he was sporting all my clothes
I gotta say I'm pretty pimpin

All he ever wanted was to be a man
But he was always a little too cute to be admitted under marbles lost
He was always a thousand miles away while still standing in front of your face

Then he woke up this morning
Didn't recognize the boy in the mirror
Then laughed and said, "Oh silly me, that's just me"
Then I proceeded to brush some stranger's teeth
But they were my teeth, and I was weightless
Just quivering like some leaf come in the window of a restroom

And I couldn't tell you what the hell it was supposed to mean
Cause it was a Monday, no a Tuesday, no Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Then Saturday came around and I said, "Who's this stupid clown blocking the bathroom sink?"
But he was sporting all my clothes
I gotta say pretty pimpin

I woke up this morning, didn't recognize the boy in the mirror [x6]

// I'm An Outlaw //

Do you got wise blood that come when [?]
I'm an outlaw on the brink of
Self-implosion
Alone in a crowd on the corner
Going nowhere slow

I'm an outlaw on the brink of
Self-implosion
Alone in a crowd on the corner
In my walkman in a snowglobe
Going nowhere slow

I'm an outlaw by the ocean
Watch it come crashing against my skin
He pulled from Gene Clark to Clarence White
And then he's alright

I'm an outlaw on the brink of
Imploding
Alone in a crowd on the corner
Burned from vinyl, dimed from cans, peaked to the dome

I'm an outlaw under Orion's belt
What a dumb thing to sing but it had a ring to it
Do you got wise blood [?]
As my eardrum drums on through the night now

Under exile, the constellations
Just-a-idling in slow motion
So is the life of the outlaw
[?] human being

// Dust Bunnies //

You may think that it's funny now
That I got a headache like a shop vac coughin' dust bunnies
It's hard to see when it's all red
And all you hear are just white noises

This little one she's a delicate creature
No safety features to hold her down
Girl you've been running on all cylinders
Pulling the yard and cutting hard

But no they won't find us lying down on the ground
And it ain't at the bar where I am or you are
We'll take a puff on a cigarette and see what we get
An invigorating fix and a black lung

Don't know much about history
Don't know much about the shape I'm in
There ain't no manual to our minds
We're always looking baby all the time

But no we won't find it rolling around on the ground
And it ain't at the bar where I am, where you are
I took a puff on a cigarette, saw what I get
An invigorating fix and a black lung

You think you're tired, put your face in my place
We swap faces and I see you're tired
It's hard to think with a squashed brain and
Let's hope that don't leave a permanent stain

How can you talk over all that racket
What's there to feel but totally whacked

But we don't got time to wallow around in it
Though it don't look so far away from where we are
I wanna put out the cigarette and leave it behind
Hold you real close, take you by the hand
We'll walk away
Walk away

// That's Life, Tho (Almost Hate To Say) //

When I go out, I take pills to take the edge off
Or to just take a chillax, man and forget about it
Just a certified badass out for a night on the town
Ain't it oh-exciting, the way one can fake their way through life
But that's neither here or there
In a way how could one ever prove you're just putting them all on

That's life, tho
Almost hate to say it
That's life, tho
In every brutal way

From Horse Point I hang glide into the valley of ashes
Just as powder head has long been burned to the ground
Yeah with fire, with fire
A chosen one just levelled the farm
I guess hell has finally frozen over
I wanna run into the rolling hills along some mid-western highway
But there are scorpions out there
There was a man who touched the lives of many
And when he died he left so many people crying

That's life tho
So sad, so true
That's life tho
So sad to say

Stay Puft was on top of the world
Then he fell all the way back down naturally
The laws of physics have shown that a man must walk through life via peaks and valleys
It was a man, a big-old-hearted man that we all put on a pedestal
And when he left this earth, but he left so many loved ones behind ('hind)

That's life tho
Hate to point out the painfully obvious
That's life tho
So sad, so true
That's life tho [x3]
Almost hate to say

// Wheelhouse //

Sometimes I talk too much but I gotta get it out
But I don't wanna talk, I only wanna listen
My baby talks soft, my ears are always ringing now
Humming a sad song when I'm alone
But you gotta be alone to figure things out sometimes
Be alone, when even in a crowd of friends and not so
Sometimes of whom you just can't distinguish but
Thank god for the former, yeah

Some bow down a hundred times a day or more
To find a way, to get back down to the temple one day
Find the temple, to bask in the glory of
Roll around on a floor of furry carpet then
Sleep soundly for the first time in forever and
Breathing deep inside

There's a desert down below the earth's core
A hidden staircase in the house that you reside in
A little something from the cupboard over there
A little medicine, it's a medication situation

Some bow down a hundred times a day or more
To find a way, to get back down to the temple one day
Find the temple, to bask in the glory of
Roll around on a floor of furry carpet then
Sleep soundly for the first time in forever and
Breathing deep inside

// Life Like This //

Wanna live, wanna live
Live a life like mine
Well I been doin' it, baby all the time
To do so you gotta roll with the punches
Jump from the sweetest to the toughest of tough love

Maybe you think I'm a talking tube
Baby try playing, that's all I really ever wanna do
You didn't hear me right, oh yeah

That's right I wanna live, live
A life like this, yeah
You wish

Wanna live, wanna live
A life like mine
Ay baby, well, get in line
Ready to take a life test
What it is, is it is the best

Maybe you don't hear me talking strange
Well, hang on you better wait
Maybe you didn't hear me right

Well it's up and down and out of sight
Do you got what it takes?
Well, I think you might

Wanna live, wanna live
A life like mine
Well I been doin' it, baby all the time
To do so you gotta roll with the punches
Jump from the sweetest to the toughest of tough love
Maybe you don't hear me talking strange
Well hold on, you better wait
Maybe you must think that I'm talking crooked
Well, that's all good
Wanna live, wanna live
A life like some
Young and dumb and full of
"come on over to my house - there's a party goin' on here" all the time
Wanna live, wanna live
A life like mine

Eh, you wish [x4]

Wanna live, wanna live
Live a life like mine
Well I been doin' it, baby all the time
To do so you gotta roll with the punches
Jump from the sweetest to the toughest of tough love

Well it's up and down and out of sight
Have you got what it takes?
Well, I think you might

// All In A Daze Work //

Chinese charms and well-tanked in Burbank
Strumming unsuccessfully but moreso just pressin' keys and
Hey Jack of diamonds all jack of horse and
Hey man I believe I'm floating and of course of course
Guess I got my mind well twisted didn't I, well…

All in a daze work, and [x5]
All in a… all in a… all in a daze work

She come flying through like a traveling gypsy show tornado
Leaving us lying there bleedin'
Cut wide open, hearts broken
Guess I got my mind well twisted didn't I, well…

All in a daze work, and [x5]
All in a… all in a… all in a daze work

// Lost My Head There //

Lost my head there [x3]
I don't wanna sit around, walk around today
I'd much rather levitate

I was buggin' out 'bout a couple-two-three things
Picked up my microphone and started to sing
I was feeling worse than the words come out
Fell on some keys, and this song walked outta me

Lost my head [?]
Lost my head there
I don't wanna talk about it, yell about it, oh no
Me, I just wanna sing about it

Lost my head there for a second
Had a little funky psychosis - oh sweet relief!
I don't wanna sit around and walk around at all today
So I gone went ahead and just levitated

Lost my head there, whoops!
Lost my head there again
Didn't wanna mess around, look around at all of it
But then I did though

// Stand Inside //

Don't talk to me
Just walk to me
I'm distant
Sure I'm your man
Do what I can
But don't stand by my side
Stand inside

That's my good girl
My whole world
Turning on the couch
Close that cute mouth
And kiss me

Like all the pretty things you see outside
Imma gonna make you satisfied
All the silly things inside my mind
Imma gonna make you satisfied
Imma gonna pick on my guitar
Baby 'til we feel it, future [?]
We gonna live in a house together
With me on the couch and my guitar, singing
"Oh my god I love you, I love you"

And if I'm not dead
North Country, your Scarborough faded
Every window everywhere I go
You spy on me
Keep me all lonely

Like all the pretty things you see outside
Imma gonna make you satisfied, and
All the silly things inside my mind
Imma gonna make you satisfied
Imma gonna pick on my guitar
Baby 'til we feel it, future [?]
We gonna live in a house together
With me on the couch and my guitar, singing
"Oh my god I love you, I love you"

// Kidding Around //

Walking on the straight and narrow
Straight between your eyes comes an arrow
Blood all over the house you reside in
But it's all an illusion

On vacation at the seashore
By the bay but far away
Inside your mind has been unkind
It brings along your brain you think

What's the meaning of this song
And what's this piece of wood
I don't care it sounds so pretty
It's change is so sublime
What was the meaning of that last line

But I'm just kidding around over here

Ooo...

Ain't it funny when others try to tell you what you're trying to do
But I'm all ears, clearly, have you not been listening to my pretty song

Walking on the straight and narrow
Straight between your eyes comes an arrow
Blood all over the house you reside in
But it's all an illusion

Walking on the rocky brawlway
Forget what I was trying to say
Now I know one way to kill me
Way to go KV
Hey can I hear me?

But I'm just kidding around over here

Ooo...

// Wild Imagination //

I'm looking at you
But it's only a picture so I take that back
But it ain't really a picture
It's just an image on a screen
You can imagine if I was though, right?
Just like I can imagine you can imagine it, can't you?
I got a wild imagination

Give it some time 
Give it some time 
Give it some time 
Give ya some time
Give ya some time

I'm laughing out loud
So much it appears that I'm crying babe, yes
Come out on the porch, mama
I'll tell you about my past
There's believers and lovers
And druggers and dreamers
And drunkards and schemers
And I'm afraid that I am feeling much too many feelings
Simultaneously, at such a rapid clip

Give it some time 
Give it some time 
Give it some time 
Give ya some time
Give ya some time [x2]

I'm looking at you
But it's only a picture so I take that back
But it ain't really a picture
It's just an image on a screen
You can imagine if I was though, right?
Just like I can imagine you can imagine it, can't you?
I got a wild imagination

Give it some time 
Give it some time 
Give it some time 
Give ya some time
Give ya some time
