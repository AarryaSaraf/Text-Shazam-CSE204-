Patience
I've got no goddamn patience
But I tried to shake shake shake it up
But I shook myself to boredom

Best friend
I do not like your best friend
And all those shades of grey-ah
They turn my blood so cold cold cold cold!

When it comes around
We barely scream or shout
Or rarely am I there
And neither of us care

'Cause I I I I I
Guess we
Was born
To fail

I I I I I
Guess we
Was born
To fail

No no no you don't
Not a-fucking-gain
With your rhyme and your reason
And your cause

Shepherd
You want to be a shepherd
Well good for you
Go ahead
Your life won't be so tepid

But when it comes around
We barely scream or shout
And rarely am I there
And neither of us care

'Cause I I I I I
Guess we
Was born
To fail

I I I I I
Guess we
Was born
To fail

Yak yak heart attack
Sat in a taxi all clad in black
Yak yak heart attack
Sat in a taxi all clad in black

I'm from the migrant crew
I don't live in a menagerie
I don't give a fuck about me or you

'Cause I'm so cold
I'm so cold

'Cause I I I I I
Guess we
Was born
To fail

I I I I I
Guess we
Was born
To fail

Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no
