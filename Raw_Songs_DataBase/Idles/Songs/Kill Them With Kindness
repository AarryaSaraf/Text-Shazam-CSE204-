"Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!", said the puppy to the snake
I've got a real big mirror of a smile and I hold it to the fakes
Hard boot sound to the ground so I see what shakes

And I'll kill them with kindness
I'll kill them with kindness
Ain't no dormouse here

It doesn't mean you have to bow, or say "Your Highness"
Just kill them with kindness
If you wanna beat the machine, keep your teeth clean

And kill them with kindness
Kill them with kindness
Kill them with kindness
Kill them with kindness
Kill them with kindness
Kindness

I guess you cannot tell from my tone, I mean ba-ba-business and I ain't on my own
I'm guessing it is hard for you to see, that-that-that-that empathy will cut down your throne
Don't you mind people grinning in your face, ding-ding-ding-ding-ding, set the champ to the chase
Woo

'Cause you'll kill them with kindness (kill them with kindness)

Your hum-drum, sarky slow lines don't bother me none
"Wa-wa-wa, woo-woo-woo" said the flower to the sun
Our love-locked congregation gift will get you slapped
"Na na na na na gnaw", said the beaver to the dam

'Cause we're killing with kindness
Killing with kindness
We're killing with kindness

Woo!
Ay ya ya ya ya ya ya ya there ain't no dormouse here
