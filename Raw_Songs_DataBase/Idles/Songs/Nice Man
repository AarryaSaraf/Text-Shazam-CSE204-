Gotta' take drugs if you want to win
Gotta' make love if you want a kiss
Get it when you're on your own
So you buy a new telephone

Hallelujah, he's wearing thin
Even the blind can see through him
Lucid cracks in the dream
Bruises into the scene

Defecated freedoms
And overusing the word
You will always see him
For what your heart would prefer

Rage
Takes time
The way my heart
It bleeds straight in
It bleeds straight in

Gotta' shout loud if you want to know
Gotta' break bones if it's not enough
Always part of the game
Pulling heart strings to maim

Is that what you will tell your kids?
He's only violent when he's wasted
Maybe he's just insecure?
Maybe he'll beat up for cure

Defecated freedoms
And overusing the word
You will always see him
For what your heart would prefer

Rage
Takes time
The way my heart
It bleeds straight in
It bleeds straight in

Rage
Takes time

I know you don't care
I tear apart my soul
I tear apart my soul

Down
Down
Down
Down
