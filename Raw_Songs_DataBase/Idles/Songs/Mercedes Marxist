Forgive my crippled head
Our revolution's dead
They've gambled all our pride
They want money instead
They've gone and speared my side
I think they want me dead

Yeah (yeah!), I think I second what he said
Yeah (yeah!), I think I second what she said
Yeah (yeah!), I think I second what I said
Check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check what I said
Chuck, chuck, chuck, check, check, check, chick, chick, chick, chick what she said

"Suicide's for cowards", he said
Whilst sat drinking himself to death

I'd bow on my knees for you
But I'm already wasted
I'd wait at the gates for you
But I'm already wasted
I'd bow on my knees for you
But I'm already wasted

Wait out
Wait out
Wait out
Wait out
Wait out
Wait out

Forgive my crippled head
Our revolution's dead
