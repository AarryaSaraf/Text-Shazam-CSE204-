God damn!
God damn!
Woo!

Cuts like a knife, stings like a tick, kicks like a mule
Acts like a prick, acts like a prick

Burn like a fire, feels like an itch, hum like a choir
Act like a dick, act like a dick

Cuts like a knife, stings like a tick, kicks like a mule
Acts like a prick, acts like a prick

Burns like a fire, feels like an itch, hung like a choir
Act like a dick, act like a dick

God damn!
God damn!

In spite of it all
Life is beautiful

In spite of it all
Life is beautiful

Strong like an ox, bruise like a peach
Eyes like a hawk, drunk as a lord
Acts like a prick

Sick as a dog, white as a sheet
Sleep like a log, work like a charm
Lost in a dream

God damn!
God damn!

In spite of it all
Life is beautiful

God damn!
God damn!
