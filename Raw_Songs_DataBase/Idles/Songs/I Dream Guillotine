My jaded visions of a
Jaded city broken
By a jaded wealthy jettison
We're not fine, we're not fine, we're not fine

Put your children in a chokehold
Put the poor in a chokehold
There's no such thing as a broken home
There's no such thing as a broken home

Tell that to the front line
The bread line, the welfare line
The factory line, the factory line
The factory line, the factory line

I dream
Guillotine
Don't tell me where we'll end
You'll be sorry when we're good and dead

My bastard visions of a
Bastard city broken
By a bastard wealthy jettison
We're not fine, we're not fine, we're not fine

Put the children in a chokehold
Put the poor in a chokehold
There's no such thing as a broken home
There's no such thing as a broken home

Tell that to the front line
The bread line, the welfare line
The lottery line, the lottery line
The lottery line, the lottery line

I dream
Guillotine
Don't tell me when we're fed
You'll be sorry when we're good and dead

All aboard
All aboard
All aboard
All aboard

All aboard the cocaine ghost train
All aboard the cocaine ghost train
All aboard the cocaine ghost train
We're not fine, we're not fine, we're not fine

I dream
Guillotine
Don't tell me when we're fed
You'll be sorry when we're good and dead
