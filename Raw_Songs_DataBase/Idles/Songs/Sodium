I feel like I understand
How it feels to kill a man
Sure fire I retire your plans
Tastes like metal

Tendon piercing like a dog
Elbow teeth crack feels like God
Shake your money maker
Tastes like metal

Kni-kni-kni-kni-knives out
I'm flying
I'm flying
I'm flying

They say fame is a hell of a drug
Until they peel the wings of a dove
It's a losing streak I'm on
Tastes like metal

Hear the bells, they ring for you
You can run but I'll run too
Dark light shine bright like a blood sheen
Tastes like metal

Kni-kni-kni-kni-knives out
I'm flying
I'm flying
I'm flying
I'm flying
I'm flying
I'm flying
