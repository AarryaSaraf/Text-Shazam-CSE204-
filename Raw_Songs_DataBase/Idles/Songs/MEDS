Jesus loves a trier
Call off the town crier
Climb that razor wire and medicate, meditate, medicate

Hide your crescent bruise
Shine your nation's shoes
Tie your owner's noose and medicate, meditate, medicate

Class guilt got me here
Smash pills, feel no fear
I came in from the rear to medicate, meditate, medicate

Drugs lost what I had found
Burnt friendships to the ground
Turn my frown upside down and medicate, meditate, medicate

Adorn the house within
Lather baby skin
Alleviate your kin, now that's what I call medication

Medication

Ornament is crime
Appreciate the wine
Your card has been declined, so medicate, meditate, medicate

(Real nice Bo, real nice
Yeah)

I'm crazy about my baby
I'm crazier inside
I've got plenty who'd come and save me
But I choose to run and hide

I'm crazy about my baby
But I'm crazier inside
I've got plenty who'd come and save me
But I choose to run and hide

Draft your pedants will
Embalm the shoes you fill
Only shoot to kill, then meditate, medicate, meditate
