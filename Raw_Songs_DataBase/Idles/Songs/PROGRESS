As heavy as my bones were
I wanna feel myself get high, high
Come home to

As light as your grace was
I don't wanna feel myself come down
High, don't come home

As heavy as my bones were
I don't wanna feel myself get high
Come home to, to

As light as your grace was
I don't wanna feel myself come down
High, come, come home

As heavy as your bones were
I don't wanna feel myself get high, high
Come home to

As light as your grace was
I don't wanna feel myself come down
High, come home to

As heavy as my bones were
I don't wanna feel myself get high, high, high
Come

As light as your grace was
I don't wanna feel myself come down
High, come home to

As heavy as my bones were
I don't wanna feel myself get high
I come home to

As light as your grace was
I don't wanna feel myself come down
I don't come to

As heavy as your bones were
I don't wanna feel myself get high
I come home to

As light as your grace was
I don't wanna feel myself come down
I don't come home to

As heavy as your bones were
I don't wanna feel myself get high
I come home to

As light as your grace was
I don't wanna feel myself come down
I don't come home to

As heavy as your bones were
I don't wanna feel myself get high
I, come, home, to

As light as your grace was
I don't wanna feel myself come down
I come
