Covered in blood
He was there for the taking
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
Dancing on the city
Walls we were breaking
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
Indigenous Children
Littered the streets
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
Contorted and wasted
While we eat for free
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
Parading around
Some Buddhist temple
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
I saw a man
Sat doused in petrol
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
Caked in Vigour
And colours of pride
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
The smell of victory
Blows my mind

QUEENS
Stop taking photos of yourself

I dream about
Burying you in a forest
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
If I were you
I wouldn't wait for the chorus
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
I've seen your face
A thousand times
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
Ignorant smiles
A mile wide
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
No one loves you
I can tell
(YEH, YEAH / YEH, YEAH)
As you spill your guts
In personal hell

QUEENS
Stop taking photos of yourself
Stop taking photos of yourself

Well heaven knows
Who will help you now
So take some photos
If you're hanging 'round
If I had my way
You would see what for
You would see me waiting
From the Ocean floor

Well heaven knows
Who will help you now
So take some photos
If you're hanging 'round
