Pride you took
Pride you feel
Pride that you felt when you'd kneel

Not the word
Not the love
Not what you thought from above

I see faith in your eyes
Never hear the lies
I hear faith in your cries

Broken is the promise of betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed
Follow the god that failed

Find your peace
Find your say
Find the smooth road on your way

Trust you gave
A child to save
Left you cold and him in grave

I see faith in your eyes
Never hear the lies
I hear faith in your cries

Broken is the promise of betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed
The god that failed

I see faith in your eyes
Never hear the lies
I hear faith in your cries

Broken is the promise of betrayal
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail
Follow the god that failed
Follow the god that failed
