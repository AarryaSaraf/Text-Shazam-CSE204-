Wa-ching!
That's the sound of the sword going in
Clack-clack, clack-a-clang clang!
That's the sound of the gun going bang-bang
Tukka-tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk-tukka
That's the sound of the drone button pusher
Shh, shhh, shhh!
That's the sound of the children tooker

Ahhh! (ahhh!)
Ahhh! (ahhh!)
Ahhh! (ahhh!)
Ahhh! (ahhh!)

This means war!
Anti-war!
WAR!
This means war!
Anti-war!
Anti-war!

Send Sally to the sandbox, baby
Send Johnny into open fire
Send Sally to the sandbox, baby
We're gunning for the stone-faced liars
Send Johnny to the sandbox, baby
Send Sally into open fire
Send Johnny to the sandbox, baby
We're gunning for the stone-faced liars

And we're all going straight to hell
