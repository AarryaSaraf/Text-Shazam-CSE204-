My girlfriend just dumped me
For Friday night TV
And a boy who's six-foot-three
She hates me
I fixed the numb, but the numb don't fix
Now I fixed and I just feel sick
Sick sick, I feel kicks
But the kicks don't kick so I act a prick

I've got anxiety
It has got the best of me
Satisfaction guaranteed
Anxiety

Our government hates the poor
Cold leaders, cold class war
Given drugs you can't afford
So the poor can't buy the cure
Car crash country, car crash scene
Car crash dislocated knee
Car crash tabloid guillotine
Car crash cash for the bones you see

I have got anxiety
It has got the best of me
Satisfaction guaranteed
Anxiety
Anxiety
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah!
Yah-yah-yah-yah-yah-yah!
Anxiety (anxiety)
Anxiety (anxiety)
