I'm council housed and violent
I'm laughing at the tyrants
I'm sleeping under sirens
Whilst wondering where the time went
I'm scum
I'm scum
I'll sing at fascists 'til my head comes off
I am Dennis Skinner's molotov
I'm lefty, I'm soft
I'm minimum wage job
I am a mongrel dog
I'm just another cog
I'm scum
I'm scum

This snowflake's an avalanche

Dirty rotten filthy scum
For a long long while I'm known as
Dirty rotten filthy scum
For a long old while I'm known as scum
I'm scum

Spit in your percolator
I am procrastinator
I over-tip the waiter
Sarcastic computator
'Cause I'm scum
I'm scum
I don't care about the next James Bond
He kills for country, queen and god
We don't need another murderous toff
I'm just wondering where the high street's gone
'Cause I'm scum
I'm scum

This snowflake's an avalanche

Dirty rotten filthy scum
For a long long while I'm known as
Dirty rotten filthy scum
For a long old while I've known I'm scum
For a long old while I've known I'm scum
For a long old while I've known I'm scum
For a long old while I've known I'm scum
