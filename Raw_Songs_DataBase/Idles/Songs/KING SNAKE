I'm the duke of nothing, I'm the sultan of sans
The, the king of diddly, I'm the shell of man
I'm the emperor of zip, the leader of nought
I'm the God of zilch, a vacuum of thought

Here lies
Here lies

The jack of fuck all, the master of none
The champion of nada, a neglectable sum
I'm yesterday's news, tomorrow's chip paper
I'm in between jobs, and I will be later

Here lies
Here lies

A drop in the ocean, a shadow in the night
A wheel with no motion, a dog with no, bite
The deputy manager's assistant's assistant's assistant's assistant's
Assistant's assistant's assistant's assistant's assistant

Don't like, don't listen
Yeah

Here lies
Here lies
Here lies
Here lies
