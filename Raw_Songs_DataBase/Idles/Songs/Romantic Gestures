Death by chocolate
Atlantic salt
Take my heart
And the flowers I stole

Sunday morning
Kurosawa
You
Are
Beautiful
You
Are
Beautiful

It seems to me
I've saved all my romantic gestures for you
If I recall
I've saved all my romantic gestures for you

The life you save
Marrying
The life you save
Marrying

It seems to me
I've saved all my romantic gestures for you
If I recall
I've saved all my romantic gestures for you

We danced to Stagger Lee
In the moonlight
Draped in gold
We dance to exploding boy
Like we were five years old

I will sack all my friends off
Pretend I like Elvis
I won't do those things
You could colour me selfish

The life you save
Marrying
The life you save
Marrying

The life you save
Marrying
The life you save
Marrying
