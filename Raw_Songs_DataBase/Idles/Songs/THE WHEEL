I got on my knees, and I begged my mother
With the bottle in one hand, it's one or the other
And so it turns, again and again

She woke from a slumber, with a crippled stance
She said she missed my brother, and wanted one more chance
And so it turns, again and again

The wheel

And so, it turns
And so, it turns

Can I get a hallelujah?
The one from the back, now
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get a hallelujah?
Hear it from the back, now
Can I get a hallelujah?
Hey!

Hey!

So, I put up a poster, saying, "Where's my dog
My friends, my family, my job?"

Nobody turned back now, except for my man
With a mournful pious grin, and a bag in his hand
And so it turns, again and again

And then the seagulls found me, I couldn't tell what year
But with no one around me, the motion was clear
And so it turns, again and again

The wheel

And so it turns
And so it turns

Can I get a hallelujah?
Hear it from the back now
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get a hallelujah
Hear it for the users?
Can I get a hallelujah?

Can I get a hallelujah
Can I hear it from the back now?
Can I hear the hallelujah?
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get a hallelujah?
Can I get a hallelujah?
