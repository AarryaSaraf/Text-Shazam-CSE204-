So alive
Some way up
So tired
Some lay up

I a bleeder
Oh, I yearn
High seer
So K up

Hold the phone
Put the call in
Don't go
I'm falling
For a bore
Appalling
I'm so
So foreign

"Goddamn, I'm feeling good"
Said the liar to the congregation
And I know I'm not what I should
That's why I'm smashing my pretty face in

Yeah, I'm on my knees for porcelain
'Cause it felt like good to me
And, yeah, I'm a fucking crawler
Crawling hurts but it works for me
I'm alright, I'm alright
I'm alright, I'm alright

I'm feeling mani-fucking-fique
I'm feeling mani-fucking-fique

So pure
So heater
So sure
So beat up
So I
So way up
So far
Seven seater
Oh no
I'm the sleeper
No go
Long teether
Blind fold
Gold seeker
I'm told
Old feeder

"Goddamn, I'm feeling good"
Said the liar to the congregation
And I know I'm not what I should
That's why I'm smashing my pretty face in

Yeah, I'm on my knees for porcelain
'Cause it felt like good to me
And, yeah, I'm a fucking crawler
Crawling hurts but it works for me
I'm alright, I'm alright
I'm alright, I'm alright

I'm feeling mani-fucking-fique
I'm feeling mani-fucking-fique

I'm on the way
I know it looks bad but I cannot wait
I ride the wave
No rest for the lamb as he goes all day
I ride the wave
No rest for the lamb as he goes all day
I'm on the way
I know it looks bad but I cannot wait
I ride the wave
I ride the wave

And, yeah, I'm on my knees for porcelain
'Cause it felt like good to me
And, yeah, I'm a fucking crawler
Crawling hurts but it works for me
I'm alright, I'm alright
I'm alright, I'm alright

I'm feeling mani-fucking-fique
I'm feeling mani-fucking-fique
I'm feeling mani-fucking-fique
