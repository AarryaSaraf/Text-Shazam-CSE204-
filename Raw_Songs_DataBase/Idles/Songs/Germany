Better son, better son
I know I should have been a better son
Makes me feel like the one, the one

Surrey, surrey
Sat in the dark in his latter days
Makes me feel pretty strong, strong

Ha ha, hey
Balling upon the laudanum
Ha ha, hey
Balling upon the laudanum
Ha ha, hey
Balling upon the laudanum
Ha ha, hey
Balling upon the laudanum

Murder, murder
You said you're too soft for murder
Makes you feel pretty strong, strong

Can't lay, can't lay
Mother of two kids from Adelaide
Makes you feel pretty strong, strong

Ha ha, hey
Balling upon the laudanum
Ha ha, hey
Balling upon the laudanum
Ha ha, hey
Balling upon the laudanum
Ha ha, hey
Balling upon the laudanum

Medicine, medicine
I know that I need some medicine
But it won't make me feel strong, strong
Holiday, holiday
I know you want to go on holiday
But it won't make you feel strong, strong
