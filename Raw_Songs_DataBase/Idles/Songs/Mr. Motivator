Repeat after me

I am I and I intend to go, go, go
Like Conor McGregor with a samurai sword on rollerblades
Like Vasily Lomachenko after four pints of Gatorade
Like Kathleen Hanna with bear claws grabbing Trump by the pussy
Like Delia Smith after ten chardonnays making me a nice cookie

How'd you like them cliches?

Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
You can do it
You can do it
Yes you can
Woo-hoo!

I am I and I intend to go, go, go
Like a Frida Kahlo painting of the poor on your fuck off wall
Like Tracey Emin in her unmade bed listening to The Fall
Like Flava Flav in the club riding on the back of John Wayne
Like David Attenborough clubbing seal clubbers with LeBron James

How'd you like them cliches?

Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
You can do it
You can do it
You can do it
Woo!

It's all about the confidence
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe
You're Joe Cal-fucking-zaghe

Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
Let's seize the day
All hold hands, chase the pricks away
You can do it
You can do it
