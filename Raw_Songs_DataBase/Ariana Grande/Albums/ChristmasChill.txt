// Wit It This Christmas //

Come and kiss me, baby
We don't need no mistletoe, hmm
We don't need no fireplace
Boy, I'll keep you nice and warm, hey

Are you down for some of these milk and cookies?
Down for loving, you'll be my drummer boy
And I'm the only drum that you gonna play

'Tis the season for some love giving
So I think you should give your love to me
Baby, let me know

Are you with it? Are you with it?
Are you with it this Christmas?
(baby, let me know)
Are you with it? Are you with it?
Are you with it this Christmas?

We don't need no presents
We don't need that kitchen
We don't need them recipes
You know I'm tasty like a candy cane or gingerbread
I'm made with love

Are you down for some of these milk and cookies?
Down for loving, you'll be my drummer boy
And I'm the only drum that you gonna play

'Tis the season for some love giving
So I think you should give your love to me
Baby, let me know

Are you with it? Are you with it?
Are you with it this Christmas?
(baby, let me know)
Are you with it? Are you with it?
Are you with it this Christmas?

// Not Just On Christmas //

I'll love you till I die, boy
Every day of my life
I celebrate you, baby
I adore you, not just on Christmas

Wanna show you in so many ways
Three-hundred sixty-five days
I'll give you all my presents, boy
I'm for you, not just on Christmas

Baby, whether rain or shine
Naughty or nice, I'm by your side

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ah-ah

I'll love you till I die, boy
Every day of my life
I celebrate you, baby
I adore you, not just on Christmas

Baby, whether rain or shine
Naughty or nice, I'm by your side

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ah-ah

// True Love //

On that first day of Christmas
When you gave me all them kisses
Boy, you showed me things
Come hold me, please, and never let me go
On that second day of Christmas
Said you felt like something's missing
So you promised me that promise ring to keep 'til we get old, boy

On that third day of Christmas
We got all in our feelings
Said "I love you" and meant it, oh
On the fourth, we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it

Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh-oh, ah-ah, ah-ah
You are my true love

On the fifth day of Christmas
You asked me what's on my wish list
And I told you all I wanted was forever with my boo
After six days in your arms
I got that tattoo on my heart
'Cause I'm your moonlight, you're my star
Ain't nothin' shining more than you, boy

You completed the vision
Now I feel like I'm living
You're so one in a million, oh-oh
I'm so glad we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one, I know it

Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love
You are my true love
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
(You are my true love)
My true love, my true love
You are my true love
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, oh-oh, ah-ah, ah-ah
You are my true love

// Winter Things //

It ain't even cold outside, not where I'm from
Feeling like it's mid-July under the sun
My jacket don't get no love
No hats and no gloves
Not even a chance to rain
But my baby's in town, and we're gonna do some winter things

Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice-cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey

Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown
(No, no, no, downtown)
Even though it's a hundred degrees, gotta get out
Ain't no ice or no chills
No snowmen to build
Most of our friends at the beach
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things

Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice-cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey

Just imagine that we're laughing
In the cabin, chilling by the fireside
Even though this sun is blasting
We can be wherever if we visualize

Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice-cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey

// Into You (Remix) //

[Ariana Grande:]
I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough 'til we cross the line, hey, yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

So baby, come light me up and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah

[Mac Miller:]
Baby this a microphone check
What you gettin' into when you get 'em
When I wake up probably I'm gonna text ya
Heard you got a man
Baby I could do it better
And I really ain't complaining
I just want you to remember
How it was, how it is, how it could be
You could put me here, you could push me
Or we can go for a ride, in the sky
Looking up, you're a high
You ain't never gotta lie
Cause it's more than just pussy
For the night everything's alright
When you lay down I'mma hit the lights
If you say so
What's a life if you don't got me
Give you what you want, what you need
What you came for
Hit me up when you're feeling blue
And I tell how I'm feeling too, so you know
I just want to get into you
Right here in the living room
Let's go

[Ariana Grande:]
So baby, come light me up and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah

Tell me what you came here for
Cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge with no control
And I need, I need you to know
You to know, oh

So baby, come light me up and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah

So come light me up
So come light me up, my baby
A little dangerous
A little dangerous, my baby
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
