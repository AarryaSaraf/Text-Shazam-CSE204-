// Raindrops (An Angel Cried) //

When raindrops fell down from the sky
The day you left me, an angel cried
Oh, she cried, an angel cried
She cried!

// Blazed //

[Pharrell Williams (Ariana Grande):]
There is something between us, I can see it right now
Your magnetic demeanor, that's something can't be found
(I thought that I was dreaming 'til my love came around)
(Now I just come on over, show you how we get down)
Shawty, you can get blazed

[Ariana Grande:]
I can't believe that you are here, I can't believe it's happening
What are the odds that you'd appear?
The universe so vast to me
Seven billion is on the Earth
Could've been anywhere, but you're here with me
Should I play lotto? What's it worth?
I must be on, so clear to me

Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you

Look at you, love, you are the same
You have a light you cannot hide
Yes, you may have a different face
But your soul is the same inside

They wouldn't laugh if they were inside my past life
With you and they were me

Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you

Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me

"Excuse me, um, I love you"
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
You're like: "I love you—who starts a conversation like that?" Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself

Got me feeling so out of place
Think 'bout you all of my days
Wish you'd chew on me like fresh grapes
Not tryna cuff you or crowd your space
I'm tryna find cute words just to say
"Dang, you fine, and look at that face"
At the borderline, beside me, you lay

[Ariana Grande:]
Baby, I just want you to be mine
Won't you give me a bit of your time? Oh, whoa
Chasin' you, no, I won't stop tryin'
Just meet me at the borderline

// Better Off //

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

You keep me in your orbit
Well, I know I'm a hard one to please
Give it too much importance
My love will have you fall to your knees
I tell 'em this too often
Know better than to bark up my tree
Just for me to fall and leave
Nah, I'd rather just watch you smoke and drink, yeah

Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart
Or jealous-ridden comments
That come when you let in them feelings that I don't want
I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional, yeah

I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya

Go on and face it, I'll never be ready for you, ready for you
I swear my love is a curse, make you head over shoes, head over shoes
Let's put them topics to bed and go fuck on the roof, just to say that we did it
You keep insisting I listen to your proposition
I dismiss 'em all, no offense, yeah

Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart
Or jealous-ridden comments
That come when you let in them feelings that I don't want
I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional, yeah

I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya

I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya, uh

// Goodnight N Go //

Tell me why you gotta look at me that way
You know what it does to me
So baby, what you tryna say? Ayy
Lately, all I want is you on top of me
You know where your hands should be
So baby, won't you come show me? Mmm
I got you, I got you dreamin' (Ahh)
You close your eyes and you're screamin' (Ahh)
Play with your mind for no reason
I know you love how I tease it (Ahh-ah)
You know that I'm playin', so don't be mistaken
You already know what I'm thinkin', boy

Oh, why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you, woah
Why must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well

Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Just say goodnight and go

One of these days
You'll miss your train and come stay with me
(It's always say goodnight and go)
We'll have drinks and talk about things
And any excuse to stay awake with you
And you'd sleep here, I'd sleep there
But then the heating may be down again
(At my convenience)
We'd be good, we'd be great together

Why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you, woah
Why must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well

Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh

I know how you want it, baby, just like this
Know you're thinkin' 'bout it, baby, just one kiss
While you're lookin' at 'em, baby, read my lips
I know what you want, but you can't have this

Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Wanna say goodnight
Honey, say goodnight and go
Wanna say goodnight
Baby, say goodnight and go
Wanna say goodnight
Say goodnight and go

// Pete Davidson //

Mmm, yeah, yuh

I thought you into my life (Whoa), look at my mind (Yuh)
No better place or a time, (Look) how they align
Universe must have my back, fell from the sky into my lap
And I know you know that you're my soulmate and all that
I'm like ooh, ooh, my whole life got me ready for you, ooh, ooh

Got me happy, happy
I'ma be happy, happy, yeah

I'ma be happy, happy, yeah
Gonna be happy, happy

// Get Well Soon //

You can feel it, feel it
(Yeah, yeah)

They say my system is overloaded
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
I'm too much in my head, did you notice?
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
My body's here on Earth, but I'm floatin'
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
Disconnected, so sometimes, I feel frozen and alone

This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body, yuh yuh yuh
Ain't no time to deny it, that is why we're talking about it
Yeah, we're talking about it
To deal with it, don't try to get by it
Ain't no time to deny it
So we had to sit down and just write it

Want you to get better (Woo!)
My life is so controlled by the what-ifs
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
Is there anybody else whose mind does this, mmm?
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
Down, down, down, down
Is there such a ladder to get above this?
(Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
(Girl, what's wrong with you? Come back down)
(Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
Maybe I should ground myself where the mud is
Before I'm gone

This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body, yuh yuh yuh
Ain't no time to deny it, that is why we're talking about it (Baby)
Yeah, we're talking about it
To deal with it, don't try to get by it (Ooh)
Ain't no time to deny it (Yeah)
So we had to sit down and just write it

You can work your way to the top
(You can feel it, feel it, whoo)
Just know that there's up and downs and there's drops
(You can feel it, feel it, whoo)
Unfollow fear and just say "You are blocked"
(You can feel it, feel it, yuh, woo)
Just know there is so much room at the top
(You can feel it, feel it, yee, woo)

(Ah, ah, ah)
Well here's one thing you can trust (Yuh)
It takes you and me to make us (Yeah)
One of those days you had enough (Yeah), I'll be there
(Yuh yuh yuh)
'Cause if it ain't one thing, it's another (It's another)
When you need someone to pull you out the bubble (Out the bubble)
I'll be right there just to hug you (Just to hug you), I'll be there
Where are you? Are you home?
(Where are you? Are you home?)
Call me right on the phone (Call me right on the phone)
I'll be there (Ayy, sheesh), yeah, I'll be there
I don't care who is gone (I don't care who is gone), you shouldn't be alone (You shouldn't be alone)
I'll be there (Mmm), there

You can work your way to the top (Woo!)

No matter the issue)
No matter what, ah, ah, ah
