// Last Christmas //

I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget
What you did last December
You left my heart a mess (a mess)
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it, oh, yeah, oh, yeah?

(It's The Rascals)

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special, oh, yeah, yeah

But last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Thought we belong together
At least that's what you said
I should've known better
You broke my heart again (again)
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it, oh, yeah?

But last Christmas
I gave you my heart, gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears (you got it)
I'll give it to someone special

But last Christmas (oh, baby)
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (gave it away)
This year (you got it)
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Ooh, yeah
How could you leave Christmas morning?
You broke my heart with no warning
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it, oh, yeah?

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart (gave you my heart)
But the very next day you gave it away (you gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears (oh, baby)
I'll give it to someone special

This is our last (last) last (last) Christmas
You broke my heart
Last (last) last (last) Christmas
You broke my heart
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget
What you did last December
You left my heart a mess (you left my heart a mess)
(This year)
To save me from tears (oh, baby)
I'll give it to someone special)
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?

I hate that I remember
I wish I could forget
What you did last December
You left my heart a mess (you left my heart a mess)
(This year)
To save me from tears (oh, baby)
I'll give it to someone special)

// Snow In California //

Dear Santa, it's me, Ariana
I know it's been a while but I really need your help this year
Let me make this clear
See, I, I really love him and it's been kinda tough
'Cause he's only in town for the holidays
Tomorrow he's flyin' away, away from me

I don't need another gift, I just have one wish
This year, can you

Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow mornin'
Give me somethin' to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow in California

Dear Santa, what happened to the plan we had?
I checked the news and it said it'd be a sunny day
Make it go away, mm-mm
See, I, I really need him to stay for a couple more days
Can't you make his five o'clock flight delay?
Won't you find a way?

I don't need another gift, I just have one wish, oh, yeah
This year, can you

Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow mornin'
Give me somethin' to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow in California

I know I'm askin' for the impossible, but I believe in miracles
I need my baby right here with me, so please, please

Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow mornin'
Give me somethin' to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow (Let it snow) in California

I'll even settle for rain
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh, yeah, yeah
(Let it snow) Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow

// Santa Baby //

[Ariana Grande:]
Santa, baby, slip a Sable under the tree for me (Mm-hmm)
I've been an awful good girl
Santa, baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Liz Gillies:]
Santa, baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue
I'll wait up for you, dear
Santa, baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight

[Ariana Grande (Liz Gillies) {Both}:]
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
(Next year, I could be just as good)
{If you check off} my {Christmas list}

[Liz Gillies (Ariana Grande):]
(Santa, baby), I want a yacht and really that's (not a lie)
I've been an angel all year
(Santa, baby), and hurry down the chimney tonight

[Ariana Grande:]
Mm, yeah
Santa, honey, the one thing that I really do need
The deed to a platinum mine
Santa, honey, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Liz Gillies (Ariana Grande) {Both}:]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
(I really do believe in you)
{Let's see if you believe in me}

[Ariana Grande (Liz Gillies) {Both}:]
Santa, baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring, yeah
But I don't mean on the phone
(Santa, baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight)
{So hurry down the chimney tonight}

[Ariana Grande (Liz Gillies):]
Waiting
(Hurry, tonight)
Hurry down the chimney tonight
