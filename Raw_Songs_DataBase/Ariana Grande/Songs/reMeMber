It's a blue world without you
It's a blue world alone

Swear it was just like a year ago
Side of the stage, I was at the show
Right person, wrong life
Thought I could make it all right
See you in the next life
Hope you're close to the light, yeah

Didn't get to say goodbye to you
But I feel like I never needed to
'Cause in my mind, you ain't gone
Still be hittin' your phone
Even though it ain't on
So just in case you don't know

Look at this love we have for you
They say the good ones go too soon
I didn't want it to be you, oh
I remember (Remember, remember, ah)
I remember (Remember, remember)
I remember (Remember, remember, ah)
I remember (Remember, remember)

I'm flippin' through all these images (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So troubled but you were so innocent (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Always kept it so cool, tryin' to be just like you (Ooh, just like you)
My nightmare came true
'Least you're up on the moon, babe (Ooh-ooh)

Look at these lights, they just for you
They say the good ones go too soon
I really wish it weren't you
I remember (Remember, remember, ah)
I remember (Remember, remember)
I remember (Remember, remember, ah)
I remember (Remember, remember)
