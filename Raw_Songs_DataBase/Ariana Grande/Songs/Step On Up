Hey, hey, oh
Oh, step on up to this
Step, step on up to this
Step on up to this crazy love

Hey, I'm classy
But I don't mind if you get at me
It's okay to get nasty, just the way that you like
You say I'm sexy
So bad, they should arrest me
You can't forget me
Gave you the time of your life

What you need, babe, is a number one
Can't you see, babe?
I have what you've been waiting for
What you need, babe, is a work of art
What you need, babe
Come get it, I got it

Oh, step on up to this
Step, step on up to this
Step on up to this crazy love
Oh, step on up to this
Step, step on up to this
Step on up to this crazy love

Hey, I'm waiting
Standing here with my ladies
No shame in chasing if we got what you like
Don't stop, keep moving
'Cause I love what you're doing
Let's rock to this music
Have the time of your life

What you need, babe, is a number one
Can't you see, babe?
I have what you've been waiting for
What you need, babe, is a work of art
What you need, babe
Come get it, I got it

Oh, step on up to this (Hey-ey)
Step, step on up to this
Step on up to this crazy love
Oh, step on up to this
Step, step on up to this
Step on up to this crazy love

Don't be ashamed, any time, any place
Let him know that you got it like that (Uh-uh)
When you love him that good, and you treat him like you should
Gonna keep him coming right back (That's right)
Don't be ashamed, any time, any place (Don't be ashamed, boy)
Let him know that you got it like that
When you love him that good, and you treat him like you should
Gonna keep him coming right back (Oh, ooh, no-no, yeah)

What you need, babe, is a number one
Can't you see, babe?
I have what you've been waiting for
What you need, babe, is a work of art (What you need)
What you need, babe
Come, get it, I got it

Step on up to this (Step, step on up to this)
Step, step on up to this
Step on up to this crazy love (Boy)
Step on up to this
Step, step on up to this
Step on up to this crazy love

Don't be ashamed, any time, any place
Let him know that you got it like that
