Ari, BIA, oye

I'm out with Ari in Boca Raton
I like my men like my trees, keep me blown
I give you more, you won't leave me alone
But there's things that I need, like my space and my phone
Otra vez, can you feel me?
Can you keep it real? One trilly
See me, do me dirt, real filthy
I'll be on the run 'til we both found guilty
Behind closed doors
I'ma let you see the real me, ya feel me?


Ooh baby, nothing's too much
Ooh baby, nothing's too much
Ooh baby, nothing's too much
Ooh baby, nothing's too much

More, I'll give you more, more (more)
I'll give you more
I'll give you more (Can you feel it?)
I'll give you more (Can you feel it?)

I realize ain't no use to
Talkin' 'bout what she won't do
No, there ain't nothing she won't go through
Come on, boo, we're talking 'bout you
I never want to ever be the cause of someone else's therapy
But she, won't understand my love for you is past lifelong

Love infinite and it is pure (And it is pure)
Only windows and open doors (And open doors)
No ceilings, there shouldn't be floors (There shouldn't be floors)
If it's what you're getting, that's what I'm for (That's what I'm for)

More, I'll give you more, more (more)
I'll give you more
I'll give you more (Can you feel it?)
I'll give you more (Can you feel it?)


I hate to be on your coattails
This the good stuff you know well
You call me when you're by yourself
Listening to my voice mails
All the hurting you go through
(Wastin' time) cause I know you
Your life could change but it's on you
So what do you say? What you gon' do?


Love infinite and it is pure (And it is pure)
Only windows and open doors (And open doors)
No ceilings, there shouldn't be floors (There shouldn't be floors)
If it's what you're getting, that's what I'm for (That's what I'm for)

More, I'll give you more, more (more)
I'll give you more
I'll give you more (Can you feel it?)
I'll give you more (Can you feel it?)


Uh, uh
Tu quieres mas, abre la boca
I flex like you see me doing yoga
I like my money, es mi aroma
Shopping sprees at Neiman's with mi mosa
I'm here to give you much as you can handle
Love is like a game, I'm the one you can gamble
Bet on, bad gals don't get lead on
Girls like these make you dive in, head on, come on


More, I'll give you more, more
More, I'll give you more, more (More)
I'll give you more (Can you feel it?)
I'll give you more (Can you feel it?)

Ooh baby, nothing's too much
Ooh baby, nothing's too much
Ooh baby, nothing's too much
Ooh baby, nothing's too much
