Hey, hey
There is freedom within
There is freedom without
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead
Many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

 Hey now, hey now
 Don't dream it's over
 Hey now, hey now
 When the world comes in
 They come, they come
 To build a wall between us
 And we know they won't win


Now I'm towing my car
There's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion, but there's no proof
In the paper today
Tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the TV page

 Hey now, hey now
 Don't dream it's over
 Hey now, hey now
 When the world comes in
 They come, they come
 To build a wall between us
 And we know they won't win

 Are you a mouse or a bear? Or...
 Um...
 Whatever you are it's probably the cutest mouse bear thing I've ever seen.
Get it!
I'm a unicorn if you can't tell
 You're the cutest unicorn in the world

 That's fine, we can just go to riff on it!
 Fuck!
 Sorry I was fucking up,
I was drifting, sorry
I was flirting, sorry
SORRY, I was flirting, sorry,
Alright, anyway
 Now I'm walking again
 Alright, everybody sorry, I'll fuck off, here we go, I'm sorry here

 Now I'm walking again
To the beat of a drum
 And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
 Only shadows ahead
Barely clearing the roof
 Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief

 Hey now, hey now
 Don't dream it's over
 Hey now, hey now
 When the world comes in
 They come, they come
 To build a wall between us
 And we know they won't win

 Hey now, hey now
 Don't dream
 Hey now, hey now
 World
 You're an angel Ariana Grande
 Hey now, hey
Hey now, hey now
 Now
