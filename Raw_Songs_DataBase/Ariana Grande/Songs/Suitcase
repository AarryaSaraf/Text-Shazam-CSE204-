I was there in the rain
Crying again
You said that you changed
But you're just the same

Now don't make it worse
By trying to lie
I saw you kiss her
With my own eyes

Don't worry
I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you
Don't you worry about me

I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready

I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone

And when I get back
You know you better be gone
Boy you know you better be gone
(You better be gone)

Boy don't look so confused
Remember the truth
Now when I met you
You had nothing at all
I guess with true love
What mine is yours
And maybe it was
But it's not anymore

Don't worry I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you
Don't you worry about me

I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready

I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone

And when I get back
You know you better be gone
You better be gone

So we believed the one that loved
Would have to hurt and lie
So we don't make the same mistakes
The problem isn't mine

I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready

I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone

And when I get back
You know you better be gone
You better be gone
You better be gone
You better be gone
