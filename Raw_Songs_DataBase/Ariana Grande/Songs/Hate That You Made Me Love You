I hate your eyes
Cause when they look into mine, mine, mine
They make me blind, blind, blind
I hate your lips
Cause when you put them on me, me, me
They make me weak, weak, weak

No, this is not, this is not what I wanted
Oh, but you got, but you got your claws in
No way to stop, I can't stop, there's no stopping now

Hate that you made me love you
Last thing I wanted to do
Hate that you made me need you
Need you so bad
Hate that you own my mind, and stole my pride, and took my head too
Why did you do it, babe
Why did you, you, you
Why did you, you, you

I hate your eyes
Cause when they look into mine, mine, mine
They make me blind, blind, blind
I hate your lips
Cause when you put them on me, me, me
They make me weak, weak, weak

No, this is not, this is not what I wanted
Oh, but you got, but you got your claws in
No way to stop, I can't stop, there's no stopping now

Hate that you made me love you
Last thing I wanted to do
Hate that you made me need you
Need you so bad
Hate that you own my mind, and stole my pride, and took my head too
Why did you do it, babe
Why did you, you, you
Why did you, you, you
