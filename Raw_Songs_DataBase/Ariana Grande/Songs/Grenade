Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open?

I gave you all I had, you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask, 'cause
What you don't understand is I'd

Catch a grenade for ya
I'd throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya
Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you baby
But you won't do the same

You wouldn't do the same

Black, black, black and blue
Beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "hey" when you get back to where you're from
Mad boy, bad boy, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face and rip the brakes out my car

I gave you all I had, you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did
To give me all your love is all I'd ever ask, 'cause
What you don't understand is I'd

Catch a grenade for ya
I'd throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya
Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you baby
But you won't do the same

If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby
But darlin', I'd still

Catch a grenade for ya
I'd throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya
Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet through my brain
Yes, I would die for you baby
But you won't do the same

You wouldn't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Oh, you wouldn't do the same
Oh, no, no, no
