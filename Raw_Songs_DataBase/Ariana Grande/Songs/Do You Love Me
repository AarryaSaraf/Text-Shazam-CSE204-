Do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Oh, do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Now that I can dance
Watch me now! Drop


I can mash potato
I can do the twist
Now tell me, baby
Do you like it like this?
Ariana, and your boy Sky Blu
I gotta tell you something, baby
I think I love you

Born to party, born to rock
Big bad, baby, we're on top, uh
Rolling in the cadi
Hilowitz making hits like granddaddy
Bust a move, get in the groove
Baby girl, I'm into you
Show me what you can do
I got you, boom
You're feeling some new


Tell me if it's meant to be
I'd give my love, but it ain't for free
So watch it now, talk is cheap
Save your cash, spend time with me
Say dance, dance, young romance
You bad boy, better take a chance
On a great date, you can hold my hand
But nothing more
Baby boy, I need to know

Do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Do you love me, baby? (Do you love me?)
Oh, do you love me ? (Do you love me?)
Now that I can dance
Watch me now!
Drop

I can mash potato
And I can do the twist
Now tell me, baby
Do you like it like this
Ariana and my boy Sky Blu
I gotta tell you, baby
I think I love you!


Got the money, got the cash
On the dance floor, I'm Michael Jackson
Time for some action, here we go
Sky Blu in the stereo
Turn it up, hurry up
She doing it Grande, that's what's up
Her plus me, you can add it up
Oh, you'll never get enough of that


Tell me if it's meant to be
I'd give my love, but it ain't for free
So watch it now, talk is cheap
Save your cash, spend time with me
Say dance, dance, young romance
You bad boy better take a chance
On a great date you can hold my hand
But nothing more
Baby boy, I need to know

Do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Do you love me? (Do you love me?)
Oh, do you love me, boy? (Do you love me ?)
Now that I can dance
Watch me now


You broke my heart 'cause I couldn't dance
You didn't even want me around
But now I'm back to let you know
I can really shuffle 'em down, yeah !


Do you love me? (Hey, hey, hey! Whoo!)
Do you love me? (Yeah ! Hey, hey, oh!)
Do you love m ? (Sky Blu, baby!)
Do you love me? (Ariana Grande)
Do you love me? (Be rockin', be rockin', don't stop me!)
Do you love me? (Put your hands up, put your hands up, put your hands up!)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!)
(Dance, dance young romance, oh)
