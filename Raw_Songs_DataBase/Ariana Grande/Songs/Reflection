Look at me, I will never pass
For a perfect bride, or a perfect daughter
Can it be, I'm not meant to play this part
Now I see, that if I were truly to be myself
I would break my family's heart

Who is that girl I see, staring straight back at me
Why is my reflection someone I don't know
Somehow I cannot hide, who I am, though I've tried
When will my reflection show who I am inside
When will my reflection show who I am inside
