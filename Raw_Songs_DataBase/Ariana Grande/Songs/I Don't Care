Used to cry 'bout some crazy shit before
I used to feel so obligated to be so much more
I used to let some people tell me how to live and what to be
But if I can't be me, the fuck's the point?
No...

I don't care about it anymore, oh
I don't care about it anymore

Now I laugh about the things that used to be important to me
Used to have a hold on me, used to have a hold on me
Like what do you think, and what he thinks, and what they think
But I love me, yeah

I don't care about it anymore, oh
I don't care about it anymore

Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
I-I-I, ooh-ooh, uh
I-I don't care about it anymore
I-I don't care about it anymore
