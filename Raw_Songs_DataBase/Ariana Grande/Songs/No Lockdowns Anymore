Oh, oh, oh, woke up today
Feeling ok, wow this is new
Oh, oh, oh, got the vaccine
And it's been two weeks
There's life in the streets
Hot people at brunch
And I've got a hunch
Mimosas are gonna be bottomless
Oh, oh, oh, turning off Zoom
After fifteen long months stuck on mute

No lockdowns anymore
We can finally walk out the door
The sunlight is a fantasy
It still doesn't feel real to me
No lockdowns anymore
Will they still take my temp at the door?
Shout out to our favorite M.D
Anthony Fauci

Oh, oh, oh, look at my hair
I'm no longer scared to have it cut
Oh, oh, oh, back in the gym where I start to sweat
Um, maybe not yet
Say, "Hi" on the street
Air kiss on the cheek
It's been so long since I've put on my shoes
So, oh, oh, let's hit the club
Or get drunk and get matching tattoos

No lockdowns anymore
Time to go back to work indoors
No more sweatpants or Zooming in
While I really watch Bridgerton
No lockdowns anymore
Traffic is so much worse than before
The world's such a new place to me
What's an NFT? I have no idea. What?

So, oh, oh, been a long wait
I'm so ready for life to re-start
(No lockdowns, no lockdowns)
(Ready for life to re-start)
No lockdowns anymore
Gonna live the next year outdoors
We could see a movie at three
Making plans is like sex to me
It's what we've been waiting for
To embrace all that life has in store
It's time to make new memories
Once you've got the vaccine (Once you've got the vaccine)
Hug your family (It's time to hug your family)
Feeling so relieved (Oh yeah, we're feeling so relieved)
No lockdowns, we're free
