I wanna mix a potion up
Make a special drink for you
Mm-mm
Just a little sip
And you're never gonna know what hit you, yeah, when I'm through
Oh, yeah

Now I'm not talking 'bout movies
Don't need no happy end
I just wanna make you love me and stay through thick and thin
I'm just gonna use some magic
Might feel a little drunk
And if you try to leave me, I'll lock you in my trunk

I'm gonna witch you
I'll stick a pin right in you
My voodoo's so addicting
3 silver spoons of branded wine
Just a frog and a little thyme, and baby, you'll be mine
With my voodoo love, aw yeah
With my voodoo love, aw yeah

Boy, I really knew you were the one
The moment that I saw your eyes
Mm-hmm
Strong, and wise, and sweet, and quiet
Yeah, you're just my type
Mm-hmm

Now I'm not talking 'bout movies
Don't need no happy end
I just wanna make you love me and be my shiny prince
I'm just gonna use some magic
Might feel a little high
But we'll be so enchanted and you'll feel so alive

I'm gonna witch you
I'll stick a pin right in you
My voodoo's so addicting
3 silver spoons of branded wine
Just a frog and a little thyme, and baby, you'll be mine
With my voodoo love, aw yeah
With my voodoo love, aw yeah

I always get just what I want, and boy, I really want you now
So just say "yes"
Can't second guess the power of my voodoo love
My voodoo love
My voodoo love

I'm gonna witch you
I'll stick a pin right in you
My voodoo's so addicting
3 silver spoons of branded wine
Just a frog and a little thyme, and baby, you'll be mine
With my voodoo love, aw yeah
With my voodoo love, aw yeah
