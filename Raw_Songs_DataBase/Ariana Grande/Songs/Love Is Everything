It's time for us to all give something
(It's time for us to all give something)
All around the world this time of year
(All around the world this time of year)
As a matter of fact, it won't cost you nothing
(As a matter of fact, it won't cost you nothing)
It's in your heart, you got it right there, you got it right there

The truth is your heart is the biggest gift you can give anyone
I know we can do it
'Cause when I look around, there's enough for everyone (Uh-huh)
If you spend a little time, look deep inside
Search your heart and I'm sure you'll find
That the best gift you could give this Christmas

All we need is love (Give love, love, love, love)
Love is all we need (Give love, love, love, love)
Love underneath the tree, love is everything (Love is everything)
All we need is love (Give love, love, love, love)
Love is all we need (Give love, love, love, love)
Let your heart believe that love is everything (Love is everything)

We'll give it all 'cause it's the season
(We'll give it all 'cause it's the season)
Spreading lots of joy and lots of cheer
(Lots of joy and lots of cheer)
If you need a cost, if you need a reason, oh yeah
It's the gift that just won't disappear, won't disappear

The truth is your heart is the biggest gift you can give anyone
I know we can do it
'Cause when I look around, there's enough for everyone (Uh-huh)
If you spend a little time, look deep inside
Search your heart and I'm sure you'll find
That the best gift you could give this Christmas

All we need is love (Give love, love, love, love)
Love is all we need (Give love, love, love, love)

Love who you love, no one can judge
Follow your heart and don't give up
'Cause that's what this day's about, ooh
So grab 'em close and hold them in
And don't let go, 'cause Christmas is here
