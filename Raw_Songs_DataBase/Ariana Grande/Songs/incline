Hey, I can't get nowhere (Get nowhere)
Get nowhere (Get nowhere)
Get nowhere (Get nowhere)
Get nowhere (Get nowhere)
'Cause I keep running back to you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)

Dear diary, it's me again
I know that you've heard this before
Don't laugh at me, I told my friends too
This time I'm mentally ready to go (Sheesh)

Something's wrong as I look around, I'm getting nowhere
'Cause I am not moving, instead, I'm sitting dead still
Something's wrong as I look around, I'm getting nowhere
I thought I was on an escalator but I'm really on a treadmill

Hey, I can't get nowhere (Get nowhere)
Get nowhere (Get nowhere)
Get nowhere (Get nowhere)
Get nowhere (Get nowhere)
'Cause I keep running back to you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)

Gettin' rid of pictures, all memorabilia (Yeah)
And I know it sounds silly but it's in the way
That's what you gotta do when you're making moves
Yeah, my mind has a better picture of your face (Sheesh)

Something's wrong as I look around, I'm getting nowhere
'Cause I am not moving, instead, I'm sitting dead still
Something's wrong as I look around, I'm getting nowhere
I thought I was on an escalator but I'm really on a treadmill

Hey, I can't get nowhere (Get nowhere)
Get nowhere (Get nowhere)
Get nowhere (Get nowhere)
Get nowhere (Get nowhere)
'Cause I keep running back to you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)

You think it's funny now?
'Cause I ain't got nowhere
But I got a heart like Wonder Woman (Wonder Woman)
Wonder Woman (Wonder Woman)
Won't be able to run me down
'Cause I won't be there
You'll be looking for your Wonder Woman (Wonder Woman)
Wonder Woman (Wonder Woman)

Something's wrong as I look around, I'm getting nowhere
'Cause I am not moving, instead, I'm sitting dead still
Something's wrong as I look around, I'm getting nowhere
I thought I was on an escalator but I'm really on a treadmill

Hey, I can't get nowhere (Get nowhere)
Get nowhere (Get nowhere)
Get nowhere (Get nowhere), Get nowhere (Get nowhere)
'Cause I keep running back to you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
To you (to you, to you, to you)
