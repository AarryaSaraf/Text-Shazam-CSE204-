Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world

Y-Y-Y-You think you're so small like you're itty-bitty
Just one match in the lights of the city
Walking by strangers on the side of the street, like
A quarter in a cup will get 'em up on their feet, like
You think you're never gonna make your mark
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like
Out of sight, out of m-m-m-mind, like
Like it's just a waste of time, like-like-like

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
I said
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Sing it if you're with me, all you boys and all you girls

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world

W-W-W-Wishing on a shooting star in the sky
We can do anything if we try
Can't resurrect Gandhi, resurrect King
But if we put our heads together, we can do anything, like
You don't have to be a billionaire
You don't have to have much to show how much you care, like
Give a wink, give a kiss, like
Give a little happiness, like-like-like

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
(Maybe we can change the world) I said
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Sing it if you're with me, all you boys and all you girls
(Sing it if you're with me, all you boys and all you girls)

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
(Let me see you, let me see you put your hearts up)
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
(Let me see you, let me see you put your hearts up)
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world

Don't let it bring you down now, down now
Don't let it bring you down now, down now
Ain't got nothing but love now, love now
Ain't got nothing but love now, love now
Don't let it bring you down now, down now
Don't let it bring you down now, down now
Ain't got nothing but love now, love now
Ain't got nothing but love now, love now

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah (Hey, yeah, yeah)
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
(We can change the world, we can change the world) I said
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah (Hey, yeah, yeah)
Sing it if you're with me, all you boys and all you girls
(Sing it all you boys and girls)

Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
(Let me see you, let me see you put your hearts up)
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
(Let me see you, let me see you put your hearts up)
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
(Let me see you, let me see you put your hearts up)
Put your hearts up, yeah
(Let me see you, let me see you put your hearts up)
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world
(We can change the world)

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
