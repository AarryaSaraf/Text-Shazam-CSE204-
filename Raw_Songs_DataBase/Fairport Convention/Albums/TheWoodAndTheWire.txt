Album: TheWoodAndTheWire

// The Wood And The Wire //

Still at school, hand of fate
On a radio show one night so late
Teacher's words didn't inspire
But he heard some truth in the wood and the wire

In a high street window it winked and beckoned
Turned his head in a single second
First month's wage, heart's desire
Under the spell of the wood and the wire

The wood and the wire can clam a man
Dreams in his fingers, power in his hands
Louder than laughter, brighter than fire
The promise that lives in the wood and the wire

Every night through the bedroom door
Every heart-throb's favourite score
Singing to his only one
All the songs that ever sung

Soaking It up like it was spilt
Every note with every hit
Even the mirror no longer a liar
Caught his moves in the wood and the wire

The wood and the wire can clam a man
Dreams in his fingers, power in his hands
Louder than laughter, brighter than fire
The promise that lives in the wood and the wire

Wheels turn round, years go by
Dreams that live and dreams that die
Hopes get swallowed by those cracks
Tears he sheds with words he lacks
Head won't rise from the mire
But It all makes sense with the wood and the wire

The wood and the wire cuts through rules
Hope to the lonely sense to the fools
Love to the stranger, truth to the liar
You've got the means with the wood and the wire

The wood and the were cuts through rules
Hope to the lonely, sense to the fools
Love to the stranger, truth to the liar
Well you've got the means with the wood and the wire

The wood and the wire can clam a man
Dreams in his fingers, power in his hands
Louder than laughter, brighter than fire
The promise that lives in the wood and the wire

// The Dancer //

His father was a dancer before him
And his father before him, and his father before him
Moving in line with the steps that came down through the years

Like a spell through the streets
Everyone had their stories and family glories
Ribbons swayed in the air of a new summer breeze

It's in his very heart, it's in his very bone
Absorbed in all its glory, absorbed in all its glory
It was written in the stone
You can see it in the stone

Fiddles played with such joy
It's hard to remember, so hard to remember
When feet felt so light they couldn't keep still
They said farewell to each spot with a Bonny Green Garter

Joking and laughter
This age-old round carried on
In tune with the year

It's in his very heart, it's in his very bone
Absorbed in all its glory, absorbed in all its glory
It was written in the stone
You can see it in the stone

The silver watch carried near his breast would have so impressed
Many younger men who were dancing then
Never missing out a day at school, he was no-one's fool
And every now and then he'd sing a song for friends

Abroad for pleasure as I was a-walking
Abroad for pleasure as I was a-walking
Abroad for pleasure as I was a-walking
Abroad for pleasure as I was a-walking

When the day's end is near the streets start to clear
At the end of the beer
His thoughts take him back to the old dancing days
His father a dancer before him and his father before him
And his father before him
Kept alive all those steps
And the tunes that they played

'Cause its in his very heart, it's in his very bone
Absorbed in all its glory, absorbed in all its glory
Lt was written in the stone
It was written in the stone
It was written in the stone
You can see it in the stone

// Wandering Man //

See how a wandering man crosses the open plain
Sure foot, inclusive he divines, you know it's not in vain
That he travels
Footprints left in the earth, show how far he's come
A long way from a baby he was born, into this great unknown
That he travels

Deep down in the diamond mines, he could fall and cut his skin
Fooled by a trick of the light, the way that he came in
There's a land beneath the moon, after his damp and cold
A place where everything's been said, but nothing has been told
Back the shadows

He could lift his head and turn to the sun
To bury that borderline
Freedom is only as good as you feel
So grasp and hold this moment in time

Lives on an ancient ground for his company
Casting out the shadows of doubt, wherever he may be
Soldier of the peaceful way, fighting from dusk 'til dawn
Everything's been ripped apart, but nothing has been torn
Except the shadows

He could lift his head and turn to the sun
To bury that borderline
Freedom is only as good as you feel
So grasp and hold this moment in time

Could I be a wandering man, making my way to you
You're on my mind all of the time, in everything I do
All great ventures ever made, needed a place to start
So every step I'm planning today, might take me to your heart
That it travels

So I lift my head and turn to the sun
And bury that borderline
Freedom is only as good as you feel
So grasp and hold this moment in time
Freedom is only as good as you feel
So grasp and hold this moment in time

// The Heart Of The Song //

Oh, come all you weary travellers
Let us take time from our journey
A few moments long
Through the way all tribulation
In the cooling breath of silence
At the heart of a song
The heart of the song

As we journey through mountains in pursuit of our dreams
How we hurry to capture the tide
Catching glimpses of valleys of tumbling streams
Where we'll stop someday when we have time

Oh, come all you weary travellers
Let us take time from our journey
A few moments long
If we lose sight of each other
I will meet you in a silence
At the heart of a song
The heart of the song

All those questions in despair that discomfort your mind
From a torrent you give for one sign
There may not be the answer you've been hoping to find
But the questions will glitter and shine

Like the starry eyes of lovers
And the moon beneath the waters
Where the magic is drawn
If we lose sight of each other
I will meet you in a silence
At the heart of a song
The heart of the song

// The Game Pieces //

We are the game pieces
We see what comes to pass
You can bury us in your earth
Or plate us behind glass

You think we're in the hands
Of the frightened or the clever
But the game pieces know
And the game goes on forever

It came about one night, mist was on the water
Everything was still, still for miles around
Darkness won her day but other eyes were watching
Into the Lewis night from the water crawled a man

All hands were lost as the vessel took on water
Panic shook the decks leaving no-one in command
He'd seen a velvet bag floating in the moonlight
He lay alive and thankful that he had it in his hand

Cutting of a knife, last words stifled
The killer took his money and rifled through his clothes
Then he found the bag with the many staring faces
Holding up a figure now he swallowed hard and froze

We are the game pieces
We see what comes to pass
You can bury us m your earth
Or plate us behind glass

You think we're in the hands
Of the frightened or the clever
But the game pieces know
And the game goes on forever

They caught up with a man many years later
Blood still on has hands, thunder in his eye
They bound him up in chains, pointed to the gallows
He told the strangest tale on the day he was to die

Told them of a sailor whose life he had taken
Told them of the bag he'd committed to the clay
Told them of the strange gods' black eyes shining
They shivered then they said, in the ground is where they stay

We are the game pieces
We see what comes to pass
You can bury us in your earth
Or place us behind glass

You think we're in the hands
Of the frightened or the clever
But the game pieces know
And the game goes on forever

Now digging on the land a crofter found a jacket
Muddy torn and faded, just a purple hue
Came across the pieces scattered in their chamber
Like finding gold to the man without a shoe

Valued as a lot the hammer moves them on and on
Sold to a name, they stand and they wait
Silent air around, none to touch them
A law unto themselves only moved by hands of fate

We are the game pieces
We see what comes to pass
You can bury us in your earth
Or place us behind glass

You think we're in the hands
Of the frightened or the clever
But the game pieces know
And the game goes on forever

// Close To You //

Ships are sailing, looks like rain out on the Island
On the rushing wind I taste the salt upon my tongue
Waves meet and fall as one against the headland
The kind of day that makes me wish that you had come

And fishing boats head out in the driving rain
Up against the swell they seem insane
And you know they'll put to sea again and again
I want to be close to you

Back on dry land people hurry about their business
Here the clock hands slowly come around
I turn my way to the top of this sultry fortress
To light the way so others won't come aground

And you know your smile is in this light
That l will send into the night
It doesn't seem to matter now just who was wrong
As I write these words to you

Ships pass, tall masts, out in the sound
Dark night, no moonlight, we've run aground

And love makes, love breaks
There's no solid ground
How my heart aches, as this lamplight
It goes round and round and round

Lonely seabird, do you have a wish to fly
Out across the decks of the unknown
There'll be nameless people trading out across the ocean
Hoping to return to hearts and their homes

While all around me now the tide has turned
I can only say what I hare learned
Another storm has come and gone but I stood firm
I want to be close to you

All around me now the tide has turned
I can only say what I have learned
Another storm has come and gone but I stood firm
I want to be close to you

// Still A Mystery //

Look to the left then to the right
Down where you're walking
You're like a spark to dynamite
The way that you're talking

Every lover that you've ever known
Has tried to find someone inside
And there's tears unanswered on your telephone
So many places to hide
You're still a mystery

You're acting out the part and giving out the orders
There's footprints on your heart and ghosts on every corner
You run to the darkness and you touch the flame
To see who's coming out to play

You run one finger down your list of names
Who's going to get it today?
You're still a mystery
You're still a mystery

Stay out late on the tiles running loose
Acting wild - never worry
Take what's mine, give too much on the line
Need no crutch - end of story

Is this the person that I love
Or a shadow that I'm chasing?
Are those dark clouds up above
Or just the way I'm facing?

I tried hard to be the one you need
Holding out for what was true
With you dissatisfaction's guaranteed
Where can I go, what can I do?

You're still a mystery
You're still a mystery
Stop playing games with me
You're still a mystery

// Banbury Fair //

The month of October, nights drawing in
A crescent moon hung in the sky
Smoke out of chimneys, a frost on the ground
Nothing is passing us by...

Me and a friend, with an evening to spare
My shirt collar whiter then white
We talked our way down to the middle of town
With the music and movement and light

I rode the big wheel and got stuck at the top
With the loveliest girl at the fair
We had a different view of the old town hall clock
As we swung to-and-fro in the air...

Shot on the rifle range, knocked them all down
Missed at the coconut shy
Closed eyes on the waters, we're spinning so fast
We thought we were going to die

At the Talk Of The Town, you've got to be old enough
Down by the boxing booth, acting all rough and tough
The thrills and the spills of it, I had my share
We were coming together for Banbury Fair

To the Teller Of Fate, we both had a go
To see if she proved to be wrong
We palmed her with silver, held onto our breath
She gazed in her huge crystal ball...

"Seeing an animal, seven hands high
Galloping wild and free
Now the picture is fading, I see nothing more
But a very good omen, you'll see"

We bet on a horse, promised another win
With the name on our ticket, Live Duck
So slow, even slower, she was the last post
I thought we were in with some luck

Jumping into the air, "Damn, you bet mine"
A winner right out of the blue
Our hearts were in laughter as we both realized
That's what the old gypsy knew

At the Talk Of The Town, you've got to be old enough
Down by the boxing booth, acting all rough and tough
The thrills and the spills of it, I had my share
We were coming together for Banbury Fair

At the Talk Of The Town, you've got to be old enough
Down by the boxing booth, acting all rough and tough
The thrills and the spills of it, I had my share
We were coming together for Banbury Fair
(Coming together for Banbury Fair)
Coming together for Banbury Fair
(Coming together for Banbury Fair)

// The Lady Vanishes //

I've seen the trick performed, but not on one so rare
She's finery in motion with ease and savoir faire
But when that name is mentioned and when her guard is down
The gaze will drop so sharply, her heart begins to pound

And in a fleeting moment
The watchful eye discerns
The Lady vanishes - the child returns

Her conversation dances, her jewels and trinkets gleam
She walks in grace and laughter as one who treads a dream
What ghost or broken remnant is it that clouds her face
And puts a frightened stranger there helpless in her place

And in a fleeting moment
A torch that always burns
The Lady vanishes - the child returns

There is a strange expression that rises and is gone
Deep fear comes into her eyes like clouds across the sun
Mysterious disappearance, unclear from where we stand
I look for smoke and mirrors, I watch for sleight of hand

She takes a breath and settles
Laughs quickly and denies
Before my words are ready
Before my very eyes

And in a fleeting moment
The watchful eye discerns
The Lady vanishes - the child returns
And in a fleeting moment
Her face still dreams and yearns
The Lady vanishes - the child returns

// Western Wind //

Oh western wind when will thou blow
The small rain down can rain
And if my love were in my arms
And I in my bed again
And I in my bed again, and I in my bed again
And I in my bed again

Now western winds and slaughtering guns
Bring autumn's pleasant weather
The moorcock springs on whirring wings
Among the blooming heather

Now waving grain wild o'er the plain
Delights the weary farmer
The moon shines bright as I rove at night
To muse upon my charier

The partridge loves the fruitful fells
The plover loves the mountain
The woodcock haunts the lonely dells
The soaring hern the fountains

Through lofty groves the cushat roves
Tine path of man to shun it
The hazel bush o'erhangs the thrush
The spreading thorn the linnet

Thus every kind their pleasure find
The savage and the tender
Some social join, some leagues combine
And some solitary wander

Avaunt, away the cruel sway
Tyranme man's dommion
The sportsman's joy the murdering cry
The fluttering gory pinion

But Polly dear the evening's here
Swift flies the skimming swallow
The sky is blue, the field's in view
All fading green and yellow

Come let us stray our gladsome way
And view the charms of nature
The rustling corn the fruited thorn
And every happy creature

We'll gently talk and sweetly walk
Till the silent moon shines clearly
I'll grasp thy waist and fondly pressed
Swear how I love thee dearly

Not vernal showers to budding flowers
Not autumn to the farmer
So dear can be as thou to me
My fair, my lovely charmer

Oh western wind when will thou blow
The small rain down can rain
And if my love were in my arms
And I in my bed again
And I in my bed again
And I in my bed again

// Don't Leave Too Soon //

Don't leave too soon, don't say goodbye yet
Your gaze is quiet and misty as if your course is set
But there's life in this party, there's a bright harvest moon
Friend of mine, see it shine, don't leave too soon

Don't leave too soon, I know it feels late
And evening's a mask in shadows, the seasons do not wait
But laughter still rings here, it can light up the room
So fix your eyes on the sweet sunrise, don't leave too soon

Oh, haven't we still got songs to sing, new colours every day
Now is not the time to disappear into the grey

Don't leave too soon, don't tell me you're tired
Your heart still has the magic, your eyes still have the fire
While there's pride and there's music, add your voice to the tune
Sweet trusted one I'm counting on, don't leave too soon
Oh, sweet trusted one I'm counting on, don't leave too soon

Haven't we still got songs to sing
Haven't we still got songs to sing
Haven't we still got songs to sing
Haven't we still got songs to sing
Haven't we still got songs to sing

// Rocky Road //

All you fine young bloods must think yourselves immune
From the traps that time will set in the sweetest tune
You must whistle up your winds and rosin up your bow
But none can foretell which is the path the restless muse will go

Oh, this rocky road, it makes a poor heart sore
If I ever get off this rocky road, I'll ne'er get on it any more

Oh, this rocky road, it makes a poor heart sore
If I ever get off this rocky road, I'll ne'er get on it any more

I used to take delight in my 'baccy and strong beer
I'd blow the smoke rings way up high, watch them disappear
And I'd drain the tumblers dry, just to loosen up my tongue
And I'd sing the weary miles behind with a rambling song

Oh, this rocky road, it makes a poor heart sore
If I ever get off this rocky road, I'll ne'er get on it any more

Oh, this rocky road, it makes a poor heart sore
If I ever get off this rocky road, I'll ne'er get on it any more

Well, I've roamed around this world and I've rode the clouds and the waves
I've met with poor men who were kings and rich men who were slaves
And I've knelt beneath the spires and I've heard some holy men
Bend the words to fit the world as it seems to them

Oh, this rocky road, it makes a poor heart sore
If I ever get off this rocky road, I'll ne'er get on it any more

Oh, this rocky road, it makes a poor heart sore
If I ever get off this rocky road, I'll ne'er get on it any more
Not any more
Not any more
