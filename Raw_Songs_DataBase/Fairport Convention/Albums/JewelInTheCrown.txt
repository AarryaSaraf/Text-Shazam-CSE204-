// Jewel In The Crown //

We are a proud land, we stand for freedom
We've got the franchise, on how to lead them
We've got the history, and books to prove it
Give us the mountain, and we will move it

We rule the waves, and, the seven seas, we
Bring the mighty, to their knees
We offer hope, and inspiration
A fine example, to lesser nations

We are Britannia, jewel in the crown

We brought a system, to the masses
Divide a nation, into classes
It's in our breeding, and on our faces
At least we're all born, knowing our places

We stay within our, social borders
We only take what, our class affords us
It doesn't matter, that it's not even
This is the nature, of the demon

We are Britannia, jewel in the crown

We are Britannia
We crowned an empire
We came and conquered
We tore their borders down
We need no conscience
God is on our side
We are Britannia
Jewel in the crown

We are your friendly, liberators
We'll free you countries, from your dictators
For a small slice, of your oil wells
We'll send our boys in, with their bombshells

We are a refuge, for the needy
Always caring, never greedy
Whatever gesture, could be finer
We've given Hong Kong, back to China

We are Britannia, jewel in the crown

Jewel in the crown
Jewel in the crown
Jewel in the crown

// Slip Jigs And Reels //

He was barely a man in his grandfather's coat
Sewn into the lining a ten shilling note
Goodbye to the family, farewell to the shore
Till I taste good fortune you'll see me no more

Now the boat on the ocean tossed like a cork
Then one fine mornin' they sighted New York
He stood on the gangplank and breathed in the air
Hello land of plenty, I've come for my share 

And he did like the ladies, the rise and the fall
Of their ankles and dresses down on the dance floor
And rollin' the dice, and spinnin' the wheel
But he took most delight in the slip jigs and reels

There's talk of a pistol, and some say a knife
But all are agreed there was somebody's wife
A dreadful commotion, a terrible fight
He left a man dead and ran into the night

On a train to St. Louis, just one jump ahead
He slept one eye open, a six-gun in bed
He dreamt of the mountains and green fields of home
While crossing the plain where the buffalo roam

And he did like the ladies, the rise and the fall
Of their ankles and dresses down on the dance floor
And rollin' the dice, and spinnin' the wheel
But he took most delight in the slip jigs and reels

A bad reputation's a hard thing to bear
Mothers pour scorn, and children they stare
So he found consolation in flash company
Things ain't so bad with a girl on each knee

Oh, they called him The Kid, and by 21
All that he knew was the power of the gun
And by 23, he'd shot 5 men down
That got in his way as he rambled around

And he did like the ladies, the rise and the fall
Of their ankles and dresses down on the dance floor
And rollin' the dice, and spinnin' the wheel
But he took most delight in the slip jigs and reels

There's bones on the desert and buzzards that fly
In the highest of circles, just wishing he'd die
But in manners of cruelty, it must be said
A landlord will pick your bones before you're dead

It was wild mescaleros I heard someone say
In the deadliest ambush near old Santa Fe
And the young buck was taken, dressed in a coat
And inside the lining a ten shilling note

And he did like the ladies, the rise and the fall
Of their ankles and dresses down on the dance floor
And rollin' the dice, and spinnin' the wheel
But he took most delight in the slip jigs and reels

// Kind Fortune //

One evening, one evening, one evening in May,
Twelve young maidens came out for to play.
A regiment of soldiers they chanced to pass by.
On one of those ladies the drummer cast an eye
And it's oh, kind fortune.

Said this little drummer to his own comrades:
"One of those ladies my heart she has won
One of those ladies my heart she has won
And if she denies me I'm surely undone
And it's oh, hard fortune."

So early next morning the drummer he rose.
Dressed himself up in his best suit of clothes.
With his watch and his fob and his sword in his hand,
He went to the lady right down on the strand
And it's oh, kind fortune.

Now he took off his hat and he made a low bow:
"Miss, I ask pardon for making so free,
Dear honourable lady, my heart you have won
And if you deny me I'm surely undone
And it'll be my hard fortune."

"Well, you silly little drummer, now what do you mean?
My father's a captain of honour and fame.
I am his daughter, a treasure to he,
Do you think I'd tie myself down to slavery?
That'd be your good fortune."

"Well my soul shall go quickly to heaven or hell,
For my innocent blood I shall spill.
'Tis with my broadsword I quickly will strike,
I'll cut through the innocent threads of my life,
That'll be your hard fortune."

"Come back, little drummer, I'm here at your will,
'Tis a pity your innocent blood for to spill.
We'll saddle our horse and to Plymouth we'll go,
It's there we'll get married in spite of our foe
And it's oh, kind fortune.

And when we are married and all fastened in,
What can they say but that we followed the drum?
And it's oh, kind fortune."

// Diamonds And Gold //

Beautiful dreamer lays in her bed
Wonderful visions go round in her head
Her father has told her the stories of old
Of princes and ladies and diamonds and gold

Lets take a photograph, pictures don't lie
Her long hair so golden, the blue of her eye

She taunts and she teases the boys in her school
They don't understand, they don't know her rules
Soon she'll be leaving to get on a train
With mirror and makeup, for fortune and fame

Lets take a photograph, pictures don't lie
Clutching her suitcase, she waves us goodbye

He comes from the shadows, with a gleam in his eye
And a golden medallion your money can't buy
He takes her to Soho and he takes her up West
He fills her with lines, he's rehearsed all the best

Now I'll give you diamonds and I'll give you gold
You'll live the stories your father has told
So he gives her the diamonds that she sniffs from a spoon
And he leaves her on satin in some darkened room

So the boys can take photographs, pictures don't lie
You'll never leave here, don't even try

So she looks at the river, so deep and so cold
Just one more victim of diamonds and gold
Just one more victim of diamonds and gold
Just one more victim of diamonds and gold

// The Naked Highwayman //

As I rode out one summer's day for profit and for pleasure
I planned to rob the London coach and take it at my leisure
A brace of pistols duly primed, a saber fit to shave on
I waited underneath the trees that lined the banks of Avon

I didn't hear her dainty step as she appeared before me
A face to charm a singing bird with words that did implore me
"Can you help me sir?" she said, "I fear the time is near run
For me to cross before the tide swells the banks of Avon"

All you roving fellows listen, while you can
Of the time that I became a naked highwayman
All you roving fellows listen, while you can
Of the time that I became a naked highwayman

So gallantly I did dismount and walked into the water
As she told me that she was a wealthy merchant's daughter
So I thought I'd try my luck and do my best to charm her
Said I was the only son of a country farmer

"Your hands they are a smooth as silk, they never touched a plough sir
And I suppose these pistols help you milking of your cows"
She looked at me with mocking eyes as coal-black as a raven
And then she fell into my arms beside the banks of Avon

All you roving fellows listen, while you can
Of the time that I became a naked highwayman
All you roving fellows listen, while you can
Of the time that I became a naked highwayman

Her honeyed lips, I was beguiled, a lamb led to the slaughter
Eventually I fell asleep in the arms of the merchant's daughter
When I awoke I was alone, my clothes and pistols taken
With just the leaves to hide my shame beside the banks of Avon

In vain I tried to catch a glimpse of the city spires
Running like a rabbit through the bushes and the briars
Then I heard the London coach and I was all a-shiver
A lady's voice was calling out: "Stand-to and deliver!"

All you roving fellows listen, while you can
Of the time that I became a naked highwayman
All you roving fellows listen, while you can
Of the time that I became a naked highwayman

"Your money or your life I'll have, it's all the same to me
It's hanged for a sheep or murder in the first degree"
She stood there in my overcoat, brandishing my pistols
And reliever the London coach of the gold of Bristol

And it's up she's mounted on my horse and rode into the distance
And I went naked to the coach begging for assistance
No more I'll play the highwaymen, nor more I'll put the mask on
I'll leave it to the bright-eyed girl who roams the banks of Avon

All you roving fellows listen, while you can
Of the time that I became a naked highwayman
All you roving fellows listen, while you can
Of the time that I became a naked highwayman

As I rode out one summer's day for profit and for pleasure
I planned to rob the London coach and take it at my leisure
A brace of pistols duly primed, a saber fit to shave on
I waited underneath the trees that lined the banks of Avon

// The Islands //

We do not fear the long ships
We've seen long ships before
Men sailed here from the Northlands
And hauled their boats ashore

They brought with them their music
Their language and their lore
And they burned their boats and stayed here on the Islands

It's midday in the wintertime
Before the moon goes pale
The winter songs are very long
The storm winds and the gales

The midnightsun's as distant
As the calling of the whales
Till spring returns again to paint the Islands

The grey seals and the otter
The salmon and the char
The land locked and the sea trapped
The free birds in the air

The shepherd and the farmer
And all those in their care
Harmonize the music of the Islands

We never feared the long ships
Till the coming of the Braer
The roaring sea in anger threw
That broken boat ashore

Spilled fuel enough to take that ship
Twice round the world or more
Filled the air with oil to paint the Islands

As if the sea had realized
The tragedy in store
Its waves continued pounding
About a week or more

Most of the crude was washed away
And never came ashore
And the sea regained its temper round the Islands

So may this be a warning
To those whose faceless greed
Would sail close to our shoreline
To save both fuel and speed

The sea is our protector
Provider of our needs
And a jealous guard and keeper of these Islands

// London Danny //

London Danny, you're a real bad penny
You're the one man that time has taught me I should fear
For the girl you left behind, she said that she'll be mine
So why'd you have to come and show your face round here?

'Cos she always said that time would make it right
And now I often wake and hear her sighing in the night
And don't think I don't know, if you asked her then she'd go
Now please don't try and take her from me, London Danny

Well I've learned to listen for your name round town
When people talk of your success in city life
And I can never tell if she hears them talk as well
And rues the day she ever was a poor man's wife

And we always said that time would make it right
And now I often wake and hear her sighing in the night
And don't think I don't know, if you asked her then she'd go
Oh now please don't try and take her from me, London Danny

Well my hands are black while yours are clean and clever
And there's ways you know to turn her pretty head
And it's all that I can do when my working day is through
To let her heart beat me to sleep at night in bed

And we always said that time would make it right
And now I often wake and hear her sighing in the night
And don't think I don't know, if you asked her then she'd go
Oh now please don't try and take her from me, London Danny

London Danny, you're a real bad penny
You're the one man that time has taught me I should fear
For the girl you left behind, she said that she'll be mine
So why'd you have to come and show your face round here?

'Cos she always said that time would make it right
And now I often wake and hear her sighing in the night
And don't think I don't know, if you asked her then she'd go
Now please don't try and take her from me, London Danny

// Travelling By Steam //

With a steady hand on the lever
And the signal ready to pass
Keep the light burning, fireman
And the water, well up in the glass

With a shoulder to the rail
There's no better place to be
Than the right side of the footplate
When you're travelling by steam

Stand in the bight, look for the green light
Voices that echo and ring down the line
One load to shed, then homeward we tread
Till morning and the coal-boy comes singing

Me granddaddy worked in the railway
A bigwig, so I've heard talk
Me father, he was a driver
Travelling pit to port

And there's no better life for a young man
With them you must agree
When you're right side of the footplate
And you're travelling by steam

Stand in the bight, look for the green light
Voices that echo and ring down the line
One load to shed, then homeward we tread
Till morning and the coal-boy comes singing

Tomorrow it's off up to Banbury
A lodging term for me
Where I can lay my head on a pillow
In a room where I can sleep

Then it's up and away in the morning
And wipe the clock-face clean
And you're right side of the footplate
And you're travelling by steam

Stand in the bight, look for the green light
Voices that echo and ring down the line
One load to shed, then homeward we tread
Till morning and the coal-boy comes singing

So pick up yer traps and yer Tommy-box
We're reaching the end of the line
Keep yer eye on your watch, lad
We'll bring her in on time

And it could have been life on the dole queue
Or mining for coal at the seam
But you're right side of the footplate
And you're travelling by steam

Stand in the bight, look for the green light
Voices that echo and ring down the line
One load to shed, then homeward we tread
Till morning and the coal-boy comes singing

// She's Like The Swallow //

She's like the swallow that flies so high
She's like the river that never runs dry
She's like the sunshine on the lee shore
I love my love and love is no more

'Tis out in the garden this fair maid did go
A-picking the beautiful primrose
The more she plucked, the more she pulled
Until she's got her apron full

And it's out of these flowers she's made her bed
A stony pillow for her head
She's laid herself down, no word did she say
Until this fair maid's heart it did break

She's like the swallow that flies so high
She's like the river that never runs dry
She's like the sunshine on the lee shore
I love my love and love is no more

// Red Tide //

She's laying in bed with a pillow to her head and the red tide rising
It came out of nowhere this morning like a red tide
And yesterday it hadn't started - big plans, big plans
She's caught between the blue of the ocean and the red of the red tide

And I would give anything to be with you again
To have you on my side and face the red, red tide

He's out in the bar and he's going too far with the red tide rising
Her face is a shadow and her open mouth is like a red tide
Tonight was gonna be so perfect - big plans, big plans
There's no holds barred in the back of the car 'cos this is the red tide

I would give anything to be with you again
To have you on my side and face the red, red tide

It's dark on the stair when there's nobody there but the red tide rising
The cloth that they covered his body with was like a red tide
And all the years they were together - big plans, big plans
No farewells, no parting laughs, just the red tide

And I would give anything to be with you again
To have you on my side and face the red, red tide

// Home Is Where The Heart Is //

Well I've been away such a long time now
And my life has changed so much
And I broke my promise that no matter how
I would always keep in touch
I could hear the whistle of the telephone wires
I could hear the trains roll by
If I can hear the whistle and the engine's whine
Why can't I hear you cry
That home is where the heart is

Who's that knocking on your front door?
Is it the friend that you never knew?
Well why don't you make sure
That home is where the heart is
Three short steps and I'll be there
Into the arms of the one you love
And never roam no more

Well you tracked me down to this foreign town
Your long distance call came through
And a voice that I'd not heard for years
Said, darlin', is that you?
And a voice of my own said, I'll be there
When I get these wheels to start
And it's not my promise that I'll break this time
But someone else's heart
'Cause home is where the heart is

Guess who's knocking at your front door?
Is it the friend that you never knew?
Well why don't you make sure
That home is where the heart is
Take those steps across the floor
Into the arms of the one who loves you
And never roam no more

// Closing Time //

Ah we're drinking and we're dancing
And the band is really happening
And the johnny walker wisdom running high
And my very sweet companion
She's the angel of compassion
She's rubbing half the world against her thigh
And every drinker every dancer
Lifts a happy face to thank her
The fiddler fiddles something so sublime
All the women tear their blouses off
And the men they dance on the polka-dots
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
It's closing time
Yeah the women tear their blouses off
And the men they dance on the polka-dots
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
It's closing time

Ah we're lonely, we're romantic
And the cider's laced with acid
And the holy spirit's crying, "where's the beef?"
And the moon is swimming naked
And the summer night is fragrant
With a mighty expectation of relief
So we struggle and we stagger
Down the snakes and up the ladder
To the tower where the blessed hours chime
And I swear it happened just like this
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
The gates of love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
But closing time

I swear it happened just like this
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
The gates of love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
Closing time

I loved you for your beauty
But that doesn't make a fool of me
You were in it for your beauty too
And I loved you for your body
There's a voice that sounds like god to me
Declaring, declaring, declaring that your body's really you
And I loved you when our love was blessed
And I love you now there's nothing left
But sorrow and a sense of overtime
And I missed you since the place got wrecked
And I just don't care what happens next
Looks like freedom but it feels like death
It's something in between, I guess
It's closing time

Yeah I missed you since the place got wrecked
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex
Looks like freedom but it feels like death
It's something in between, I guess
It's closing time

Yeah we're drinking and we're dancing
But there's nothing really happening
And the place is dead as heaven on a Saturday night
And my very close companion
Gets me fumbling gets me laughing
She's a hundred but she's wearing
Something tight
And I lift my glass to the awful truth
Which you can't reveal to the ears of youth
Except to say it isn't worth a dime
And the whole damn place goes crazy twice
And it's once for the devil and once for Christ
But the boss don't like these dizzy heights
We're busted in the blinding lights
Busted in the blinding lights
Of closing time

The whole damn place goes crazy twice
And it's once for the devil and once for Christ
But the boss don't like these dizzy heights
We're busted in the blinding lights
Busted in the blinding lights
Of closing time

Oh the women tear their blouses off
And the men they dance on the polka-dots
It's closing time
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
It's closing time
I swear it happened just like this
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
It's closing time
The gates of love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
But closing time
I loved you when our love was blessed
I love you now there's nothing left
But closing time
I miss you since the place got wrecked
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex
