// Set Me Up //

Standing here, holding an empty cup
You can set me up
You have set me up

Took an inch, but you needed that extra look
You can set me up
You have set me up

Took an apple, sit from the tree
You can set me up
You have set me up

Just one bite, straight into ecstasy
You can set me up
You have set me up

No logic can be used to explain
How I'm in this situation
There's no answers
This is only a game
I'm choking on the seeds of doubt

On the front page, a mother she was crying
You can set me up
You have set me up

To the children she knew she was denying
You can set me up
You have set me up

Next to her, leaning on her shoulder
You can set me up
You have set me up

Crazy man, paid a price for what he told her
You can set me up
You have set me up

No logic can be used to explain
How I'm in this situation
There's no answers
This is only a game
I'm choking on the seeds of doubt

Cased in gold, a future I can see
You can set me up
You have set me up

Fix my eyes are nothing but a memory
You can set me up
You have set me up

Open the door there was just an empty space
You can set me up
You have set me up

What I shot at, I could only see your face
You can set me up
You have set me up

No logic can be used to explain
How I'm in this situation
There's no answers
This is only a game
I'm choking on the seeds of doubt

Standing here, holding an empty cup
You can set me up
You have set me up

Took an inch, but you needed that extra look
You can set me up
You have set me up

// Red And Gold //

Red and Gold are royal colours
Peasant colours are green and brown
Green is the corn in the brown earth when it's growing
Red and gold when the harvest is cut down

Through Cropredy in Oxfordshire the Cherwell takes its course
And the willows weep into its waters clear
My name it is Will Tims and it's here that I was born
And raised in faith my King and God to fear

In 1644 the King in Oxford Town did dwell
Though we'd heard that Cromwell's army was nearby
It did not occur to me that little Cropredy
Could be witness to the meeting of both sides

On June the 29th that year I was about my work
Cutting hedges in the meadow by the stream
My blade slipped, I cut my hand and my own dear blood did flow
Upon the brown earth and the corn still green

Now it did distress me so to watch my own blood flow
And quickly soak into the greedy ground
In red and gold my colours swam and sweat broke on my brow
And faint I knew that I must lay me down

At first I thought the thundering was just inside my head
So I raised myself above the hedge to see
And I watched as in a dream as the armies fought downstream
The Battle for the Bridge at Cropredy

Now the King's men fought in red and gold though Cromwell's men were plainer
The blood they spilled was coloured just the same
Through the hedgerow's fragile cover I saw brother killing brother
And all of this was done in Jesus' name

All that day and all the next the battle it was raging
Though when darkness came I slipped away
But the crying of the dying kept me wakeful and just lying
In my bed until the dawning of the day

And the dreams I had were red and gold
And the little stream became a flood
From all my brothers killing one another
Till waking I realized it was all my own dear blood

Some were buried in the church and some just where they fell
With no markers to declare their place of rest
But the poppies they do grow where they were never sown
And to my mind they do declare it best

And each year when the green corn once again turns into gold
And the poppies in the field again remind me
Like the scar upon my hand and the blood spilled on this land
And the hungry earth so eager to confine me

For read and gold they are the colours
One is blood and one is power
Though I may find my rest in Cropredy Church
In golden fields forever will spring the poppy flower

By Cropredy the Cherwell is still bidden to keep flowing
And the willows by its side still gently weep
But still in restless dreams by this most peaceful stream
The poppies wake me from my rightful sleep

And the dreams I have are red and gold
And the little stream becomes a flood
From all my brothers killing one another
Till waking I realize it's all my own dear blood

// Dark Eyed Molly //

Deep and dark are my true love's eyes
Blacker still is the winter turning
As the sadness of parting proves
And brighter now is the lantern burning
That lightens my path to her

No fiddle tune will take the air
But I'll see her swift feet a-dancing
And the swirl of her long brown hair
Her smiling face and her dark eyes glancing
As we stepped up from Banbury Fair

If my waiting prove in vain
Then I'll pack and track ever take me
And the long road will ease my pain
No jewelled mankind will ever make me
Whisper love's words again

For in drink I'll seek good company
My ears will ring with the tavern's laughter
And I'll hear not her last sweet sigh
And who's to know in the morning after
How I long for her dear dark eyes
And I long for her dear dark eyes
How I long for her dear dark eyes

// London River //

London River, oh the London River
All the love I have I'll give her
London River, oh the London River
That's the river for me

First time that I set my eyes upon her
Tell no lie, upon my honour
Sights and sounds that made my heart a-shiver
Then I saw her on the London River...

London River, oh the London River
All the love I have I'll give her
London River, oh the London River
That's the river for me

Signed to my master in the 1930s
The hours were long and the work was dirty
Out in the indies where the Rum is brewed
Had me a drop and got me kidneys too

London River, oh the London River
All the love I have I'll give her
London River, oh the London River
That's the river for me

Signed for a while on the old rasover
Some of them stewards they'll blow you over
Lipstick and Makeup, and all that muck
Walk like a woman and they call you duck

London River, oh the London River
All the love I have I'll give her
London River, oh the London River
That's the river for me

First time that I set my eyes upon her
Tell no lie, upon my honour
Sights and sounds that made my heart a-shiver
Then I saw her on the London River...

London River, oh the London River
All the love I have I'll give her
London River, oh the London River
That's the river for me

// The Summer Before The War //

All on a Saturday
Bright as a Bell
Early, and just for the ride
We took a trip
Cycling down to the sea
You and your lady, and I

Oh what a summer
Oh what a sun
Bright in the blue sky it clung

One day at whitsun
The sea and the shore
The summer before the war

All summer places where
You could taste the country air
Racing our shadows we'd fly
Down through the narrow lanes
Chasing the slow trains
The last of an age going by

We had a good time
We had some fun
There was time then and we all were young

One day at whitsun
The sea and the shore
The summer before the war

Young hearts and young souls
Young minds to unfold
Knowing the untold somehow

One day at whitsun
The sea and the shore
The summer before the war

Young hearts and young souls
Young minds to unfold
Knowing the untold somehow

One day at whitsun
The sea and the shore
The summer before the war

We found a small cove
By the sand and the water
Salt air brushing our skin
Your hand in her mind
Her hand in mine
Watching the sea rushing in

Oh what a moment
Oh what a day
We held it, and it never slipped away

One day at whitsun
The sea and the shore
The summer before the war

// Open The Door, Richard //

Well, there's certain things
That I learned from Jim
He'd always make sure I'd understand
That there is a certain way
That we all must swim
If we expect to live off
Of the fat of the land

Open the door, Richard
I've heard it said before
Open the door, Richard
I've heard it said before
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more

There's a certain thing
That I learned from my friend, Mouse
A man who never even blushes
That we must expect to always flush out our house
If we don't want goin' 'round housing flushes

Open the door, Richard
I've heard it said before
Open the door, Richard
I've heard it said before
And I ain't gonna hear it said no more

"Take care of all your memories"
Said Mick
"For you cannot relive them
Remember that when you're out there
Tryin' to heal the sick
That you must always
First forgive them"

Open the door, Richard
I've heard it said before
Open the door, Richard
I've heard it said before
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more

Open the door, Richard
I've heard it said before
Open the door, Richard
I've heard it said before
And I ain't gonna hear it said no more
