// How Many Times //

You broke my heart so many times that I can't count the pieces
Every time you push me down, it seems my love increases
How many times do you have to fall, while others stand there gawking?
How many times do you have to fall, before you end up walking?

I tried to give you all I have, to prove that I'm not bluffing
They say it's a man with nothing to lose who winds up losing nothing
My head is full of dreams and schemes and my tongue tied up from talking
How many times do you have to fall, before you end up walking?

I tried to give you all I have, I thought our love was strong
I always thought I'd treat you right, how did I get you wrong?
Won't you even open up the door to see the wares I'm hawking?
How many times do you have to fall, before you end up walking?

Won't you give me one more chance? I couldn't do much worse
I emptied out my heart for you before it has to burst
I'm too hungry not to wait, you're the game I'm stalking
How many times do you have to fall, before you end up walking?

// Honour And Praise //

On a fine summer's morning as we lay at the quay
The holds were filled high with the treasures of the sea
So that they could be transported by men such as we
To homeland and for Queen

When the loading was done, we hoisted full sail
Prayed for good winds to guide us and deliverance from gales
And the thoughts of the crew turned to home and strong ale
As we cast off the ropes and set sail

Fight for honour and for praise
Sailed the sea throughout the days
In cold ground I'll never lay
I'd rather die on the ocean

Thirty days out to sea and the weather was fine
The wind that we'd prayed for and making good time
The honour of first home was soon to be mine
To homeland and to Queen

But the night became stormy and the wind changed our course
A gale was a-blowing and the wind gathered force
And I wondered if ever we'd reach our home port
Or if we'd all be lost in the storm

Fight for honour and for praise
Sailed the sea throughout the days
In cold ground I'll never lay
I'd rather die on the ocean

Well, the waves washed the deck, in the wind we were locked
I fought with the wheel to stay clear of the rocks
But the fighting is in vain, in the storm we were lost
And our prayers blew away on the wind

Well, I coughed and I choked and I tasted the sea
I looked over the sands, there was no one but me
And I knew that the might of the sea had finished me
And I wished that I'd drowned in the storm

Fight for honour and for praise
Sailed the sea throughout the days
In cold ground I'll never lay
I'd rather die on the ocean

And I've lived with the thought for the rest of m' days
That I'd given the lives of the crew just to pay
In search of the garlands of honour and praise
And I wish that I'd drowned in the storm

Fight for honour and for praise
Sailed the sea throughout the days
In cold ground I'll never lay
I'd rather die on the ocean

Fight for honour and for praise
Sailed the sea throughout the days
In cold ground I'll never lay
I'd rather die on the ocean

// The Hiring Fair //

Well, I went down to the hiring fair for to sell my labour
I noticed a maid in the very next row and
I hoped she'd be my neighbour
Imagine then my delight when the farmer picked us both
I spoke not a word on the cart to the farm
But my heart beat in my throat

Well, my lodgings were dry and my master fair
And I gave him full measure
But my envy grew like the corn in the field
For in his house was my treasure
I'd watch her carry water or drive cows from the byre
And the heat from the sun made the corn grow strong
And with it my desire

Well, I'd see her in my dreaming, and in my dreams caress
Her eyes, her lips, and her dark brown hair
The curves beneath her dress
When harvest time it came at last, so heavy was the task
That the women and the men worked side by side
And I had her near at last

So I swung harder with my scythe. Few words between us passed
And I cursed my tongue-tied youthfulness
And hoped that she'd hear my heart
When all was safely gathered in, and we sat down to rest
My trembling fingers touched her arm and
She placed them on her breast

And then she turned to me as the sun went down
And all my senses reeled
As we lay there on the scented ground and
The moon rose over the field...

Well she was safely gathered in my arms when from the barn
Drifted the sound of a violin and we hurried back to the farm
And all were dancing in the lantern light and music filled the air
And I thanked my stars for the harvest moon and
The girl from the hiring fair

And all were dancing in the lantern light and music filled the air
And I thanked my stars for the harvest moon and
The girl from the hiring fair

// Wat Tyler //

And on the field at Blackheath
Us commons covered the earth
More men than ever I did see
Poor honest men from birth

The men were up from Kent, and out of Essex too
Though naught but the Thames divides us and unites us onwards
Through all the villages of England and on to London town
Where we poor men would meet our king and lay our grievance down
Wat Tyler led us men from Kent, rough hands were shaken there
King Richard and the commons our bold resolve and prayer

We knew our king would hear us, our loyalty was clear
T'was the bloody lawyers' poll tax that had brought us labourers here
And yet he wouldn't see us, so to London we did roar
And the poor there and the Essex men burst down the prison door
What happened at the Tower was justice, rough in part
The murders of the Flemish boys sat uneasy in my heart
"And now the king must see us" said Tyler to his men
And the very next day young Richard came and met us at Mile End

And on the field at Blackheath
Us commons covered the earth
More men than ever I did see
Poor honest men from birth

Kent and Essex, Bedford, Sussex received King Richard's word
No harm nor blame would come to them if home they would return
And Lincoln, Cambridge, Stafford too received our young king's favour
And thirty thousand left us there, believing it was over
But Tyler, he was not convinced and told us to remain
"I want to hear his words again, for nothing much has changed"
So Tyler, he approached the king and took Richard by the arm
And his rough but friendly gesture caused Richard's knights alarm

"Ah my lord" said Tyler, "companions we shall be"
"I shall trust in you my lord, if you will trust in me"
And so he called for water, and then he called for ale
And his manner shocked young Richard's knights and I watched the Lord Mayor pale
"I know this man" a voice accused, "Wat Tyler is a thief"
The Lord Mayor feared he'd harm the king, that was his true belief
And there at Smithfield drew his sword, and cut our captain down
And the heart went out of all of us with his blood upon the ground

And on the field at Blackheath
Us commons covered the earth
More men than ever I did see
Poor honest men from birth

Young Richard, he was merciful and he pardoned one and all
But home to Kent like beaten dogs, still serfs we had to crawl
But how precious was our liberty and the hope that filled us all
That left poor Tyler's severed head upon a bloody pole
