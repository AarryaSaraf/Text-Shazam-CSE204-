// Come All Ye //

Come all ye rolling minstrels
And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the air
And move the rolling sky

Those that dance will start to dance
And those who don't will sway
In time to this our merry tune
That we play for you today

So come all ye rolling minstrels
And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the air
And move the rolling sky

Our fiddler, he just loves to play
And that's why he plays so good
And now he plays a violin
Made out of solid wood

So come all ye rolling minstrels
And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the air
And move the rolling sky

Possessor of the magic touch
But no magician, he
Will play for you some magic notes
Instead as you will see

So come all ye rolling minstrels
And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the air
And move the rolling sky

The sound of beating on the drums
From behind you hear
And to the rhythm of guitar
We hope you'll lend an ear

So come all ye rolling minstrels
And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the air
And move the rolling sky

Well, the man who plays the bass does make
Those low notes that you hear
And the high notes come from you and me
For we will sing so clear

So come all ye rolling minstrels
And together we will try
To rouse the spirit of the air
And move the rolling sky

// Reynardine //

One evening as I rambled
Among the leaves so green
I overheard a young woman
Converse with Reynardine

Her hair was black, her eyes
Were blue, her lips as red as wine
And he smiled to gaze upon her
Did that sly, bold Reynardine

She said, "Kind sir, be civil
My company forsake
For in my own opinion
I fear you are some rake"

"Oh no," he said, "no rake am I
Brought up in Venus' train
But I'm seeking for concealment
All along the lonesome plain"

"Your beauty so enticed me
I could not pass it by
So it's with my gun I'll guard you
All on the mountain side"

"And if by chance you should look
For me, perhaps you'll not me find
For I'll be in my castle
Inquire for Reynardine"

Sun and dark she followed him
His teeth did brightly shine
And he led her up a-the mountains
Did that sly, bold Reynardine

// Farewell, Farewell //

Farewell, farewell to you who would hear
You lonely travelers all
The cold north wind will blow again
The winding road does call

And will you never return to see
Your bruised and beaten sons?
"Oh, I would, I would, if welcome I were
For they loathe me, every one"

And will you never cut the cloth
Or drink the light to be?
And can you never swear a year
To any one of we?

"No, I will never cut the cloth
Or drink the light to be
But I'll swear a year to one who lies
Asleep along side of me"

Farewell, farewell to you who would hear
You lonely travelers all
The cold north wind will blow again
The winding road does call

// Crazy Man Michael //

Within the fire and out upon the sea
Crazy Man Michael was walking
He met with a raven with eyes black as coals
And shortly they were a-talking
Your future, your future I would tell to you
Your future you often have asked me
Your true love will die by your own right hand
And crazy man Michael will cursed be

Michael he ranted and Michael he raved
And beat up the four winds with his fists-o
He laughed and he cried, he shouted and he swore
For his mad mind had trapped him with a kiss-o
You speak with an evil, you speak with a hate
You speak for the devil that haunts me
For is she not the fairest in all the broad land
Your sorcerer's words are to taunt me

He took out his dagger of fire and of steel
And struck down the raven through the heart-o
The bird fluttered long and the sky it did spin
And the cold earth did wonder and start-o
O where is the raven that I struck down dead
And here did lie on the ground-o
I see that my true love with a wound so red
Where her lover's heart it did pound-o

Crazy Man Michael he wanders and calls
And talks to the night and the day-o
But his eyes they are sane and his speech it is plain
And he longs to be far away-o
Michael he whistles the simplest of tunes
And asks the wild wolves their pardon
For his true love is flown into every flower grown
And he must be keeper of the garden

// The Quiet Joys Of Brotherhood //

I can't believe that it's so cold

As gentle tides go rolling by
Along the salt sea strand
The colours blend and roll as one
Together in the sand
And often do the winds entwine
Do send their distant call
The quiet joys of brotherhood
And love is lord of all

The oak and weed together rise
Along the common ground
The mare and stallion light and dark
Have thunder in their sound
The rainbow sign, the blended flower
Still have my heart in thrall
The quiet joys of brotherhood
And love is lord of all

But man has come to plough the tide
The oak lies on the ground
I hear their fires in the fields
They drive the stallion down
The roses bleed both light and dark
The winds do seldom call
The running sands recall the time
When love was lord of all
