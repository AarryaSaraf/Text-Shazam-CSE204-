// Lord Marlborough //

You generals all and champions bold that takes delight in fields
That knocks down churches and castle walls but now to death must yield
We must go and face our daring foes and with a sword and shield
I often fought with my merry men but now to death must yield

I am an Englishman by birth, Lord Marlborough is my name
And I was brought up in London town, a place of noted fame
I was beloved by all my men, kings and princes likewise
And then all the towns we took to all the world's surprise

King Charles the Second I did serve to face our foes in France
And at the battle of Ramillies we boldly did advance
The sun was down, the earth did quake, so loudly did he cry
"Fight on, my boys, for old England's sake, we'll conquer or we'll die"

But now we gain for victory and bravely kept the field
We took great numbers of prisoners and forced them all to yield
That very day my horse got shot, 'twas by a musket ball
And as I mounted up again, my aide-de-camp did fall

Now I on a bed of sickness lie, I am resigned to die
You generals and champions bold stand true as well as I
"Stand true my lads and fight no man but fight with courage bold"
I led my men through smoke and fire but ne'er was slight with gold

// Sir William Gower //

I am a sailor, both stout and strong
To a goodly vessel I do belong
Well guard and anchored and well equipped
Sir William Gower and a very fine ship

Our captain in his cabin lay
When a dreadful voice to him did say
"This night with me in the deep you'll be
So prepare yourself and your company"

The sky grew dark and the sea grew still
Bold men were fearful and the air was chill
Sir William rose to meet his men
Saying "Hear me now for I'll not speak again"

"I loved my mother when she was alive
And to my sister I gave babies five
I killed my wife and her children three
So I now must face what has come for me"

"You'll lash a timber close to my side
And throw me out on the water wide
And if I swim then let me be
But if I sink then pray for me"

So we tied his head and we tied his feet
And around his middle a winding sheet
At every knot the sea did stir
Grew ready for the murderer

And then we saw his open grave
The likeness of a single wave
That swept our ship from her stern to her bow
And bore away Sir William Gower

// Wizard Of The Worldly Game //

For seven years I've stood right here
And the flowers grow green by day
All for the yarns that I was told
I spread my arms when they grew cold
And warded off the rain
The bigger the tree, the deeper the roots
The grass that is trodden underfoot
Give it time and it will surely rise again

I'm rocked by winds and I'm soaked by rains
And I'll bow and sometimes bend
Until I fall and crush the forms
Of a few small friends who stood through storms
And who will rise again
The bigger the tree, the deeper the roots
The grass that is trodden underfoot
Give it time and it will surely rise again

It's laughter dust, the Derby's just
Be do be law be done
Wile to win and wise to pain
Wizard of the worldly game
Treasoned into trust
The bigger the tree, the deeper the roots
The grass that is trodden underfoot
Give it time and it will surely rise again

// The Journeyman's Grace //

Someone told me there's a grace that leads you straight from place to place
And you always leave the road behind you
You don't need your horses shod, just a dowser and his rod
Leave your mistress, she won't need to find you

Oh please, journeyman, help me on my way
Oh please, help me please, I won't be afraid
Oh please, journeyman, help me on my way
Oh please, help me please, I won't be afraid

Leave my weary flesh and bone to a circle made of stone
Take me to the mountains for my pleasure
And if the dead man won't depart, drive a stake into his heart
And let me ere deliver him his leisure

Oh please, journeyman, help me on my way
Oh please, help me please, I won't be afraid
Oh please, journeyman, help me on my way
Oh please, help me please, I won't be afraid

Oh please, journeyman, help me on my way
Oh please, help me please, I won't be afraid
Oh please, journeyman, help me on my way
Oh please, help me please, I won't be afraid

When you see the race is run and the dark has just begun
Come on with the few and leave the many
There you'll find the journeyman with a lantern in his hand
He'll show you a good time for a penny

Oh please, journeyman, help me on my way
Oh please, help me please, I won't be afraid
Oh please, journeyman, help me on my way
Oh please, help me please, I won't be afraid

// Angel Delight //

John the Wood went out one day
To view the scene from a different angle
He stood and watched a child at play
A-tinkling on an old triangle
Dave the Drum who was passing by
Bought the toy with a coin he'd picked up
You should have seen the gleam in his eye
As he saw it soon, his, cleaned-up shined-up
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la

Out in the rain if you want a cup of tea
Dodge the puddles in the yard
The lord of the land's coming round to complain
It's hard

The peacock flew to a very high tree
He didn't like grass or concrete fairies
Put me where the action is
I'd rather be with the next-door hairies
Simon spied the bathroom door
In his hand's a herb shampoo
Waiting for the waters raw
So little time, so much to do
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la

Stand in a line, take a book along
There's time for a game of cards
Now it's your turn and the water's all gone
It's cold

The next to appear was the Mighty Gled
He needs a rest or at least he says so
You probably think that he's flipped his lid
'Cause he wears high heels and a snow-white trousseau
Five foot three yet he stands so tall
And on the ground his feet are never
Friends may come and friends may go
But the fiddle bill goes on for ever
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la

The music room would make you grin
It's cold as a freezing pit
There's a hole in the wall where a lorry came in
Let's split

I quite like a breast of chicken
And I'm crazy about aspic and roast quails
But the sight to make my pulse rate quicken
Is a dozen nice fat snails
On the other hand, there's Pegg on the bass
Whose tastes in food are very much wider
You'll see a smile light up his face
At a couple of kippers and a glass of cider
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la

Stand on a chair if you want to watch the box
The fleas can jump a mile
Peer through the haze watching Top Of The Pops
And smile

// Banks Of The Sweet Primroses //

As I walked out on a midsummer's morning
For to view the fields and to take the air
Down by the banks of the sweet primroses
There I beheld a most love lie fair

Three short steps, I stepped up to her
Not knowing her as she passed me by
I stepped up to her, thinking for to view her
She appeared to be like some virtuous bride

I says: 'Fair maid, where are you going?'
'And what's the occasion of all your grief?'
'I will make you as happy as any lady'
'If you will grant to me one small relief'

'Stand off, stand off, you're a false deceiver'
'You are a false deceitful man, I know'
Tis you that has caused my poor heart to wander'
'And in your comfort lies no refrain'

So I'll go down to some lonesome valley
Where no man on earth shall there me find
Where the pretty little small birds do change their voices
And every moment blows blusterous wind

So come all young men who go a-sailing
Pray pay attention to what I say
For there's many a dark and a cloudy morning
Turns out to be a sunshiny day

// The Bonny Black Hare //

On the fourteenth of May at the dawn of the day
With my gun on my shoulder to the woods I did stray
In search of some game if the weather proved fair
To see could I get a shot at the bonny black hare

Oh, I met a young girl there with her face as a rose
And her skin was as fair as the lily that blows
I says "My fair maiden, why ramble you so?
Can you tell me where the bonny black hare do go?"

Oh, the answer she gave me, her answer was "No
But it's under me apron they say it do go
And if you'll not deceive me I vow and declare
We'll both go together to hunt the bonny black hare"

Well, I laid this girl down with her face to the skies
And I took out my ramrod and my bullets likewise
I says "Lock your legs round me and dig in with your heels
For the closer we get, oh, the better it feels"

The birds they were singing in the bushes and trees
And the song that they sang was "Oh, she's easy to please"
I felt her heart quiver and I knew what I'd done
Says I "Have you had enough of my old sporting gun?"

Oh, the answer she gave me, her answer was "Nay
It's not often young sportsmen like you come this way
And if your powder is willing and your bullets play fair
Why don't you keep firing at the bonny black hare?"

"Oh, my powder is wasted and my bullets all gone
My ramrod is limp and I cannot fire on
But I'll be back in the morning and if you are still here
We'll both go together to hunt the bonny black hare"

// Sickness And Diseases //

I do hate to see a rover crippled in the stones
Now he's one step nearer to the ground
And I do hate to see a hawker broken in the bones

Sickness and diseases pull you down, pull you down
Sickness and diseases pull you down

Everybody's got the sickness, everybody's down
Running to the doctor with a pound
"Doctor, doctor, do you have a needle big enough for me?"

Sickness and diseases pull you down, pull you down
Sickness and diseases pull you down

Sickness and diseases pull you down, pull you down
Sickness and diseases pull you down

My friend Billy, well he looks so ill, his face is white as milk
Everybody runs for miles when he's in town
He's got every known disease and some without a name

Sickness and diseases pull you down, pull you down
Sickness and diseases pull you down

If you want to live to be a poor man or a prince
Pay good attention when evil times abound
Always listen to what your mother says and stay in bed at night

Sickness and diseases pull you down, pull you down
Sickness and diseases pull you down

Sickness and diseases pull you down, pull you down
Sickness and diseases pull you down
