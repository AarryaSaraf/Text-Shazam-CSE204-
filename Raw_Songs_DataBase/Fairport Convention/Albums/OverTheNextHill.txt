Album: OverTheNextHill

// Si Tu Dois Partir //

C'est pas que je te demande
De faire ce que tu n'as jamais fait
C'est seulement qu'il fait trop tard
Et il fait trop noir pour trouver la porte

Mais si tu dois partir, va t'en
Mais si tu dois partir, va t'en
Si non, tu dois rester la nuit

C'est pas que je te demande
De prendre part dans ce jeu
C'est seulement que je n'ai pas de montre
Et tu demandes toujours le par contre

Mais si tu dois partir, va t'en
Mais si tu dois partir, va t'en
Si non, tu dois rester la nuit

Tu sais j'aurais des cauchemars
Et aussi mauvaise conscience
Si je t'empèchais de faire
Ce que vraiment tu espères

Mais si tu dois partir, va t'en
Mais si tu dois partir, va t'en
Si non, tu dois rester la nuit

La, la, la...

Mais si tu dois partir, va t'en
Mais si tu dois partir, va t'en
Si non, tu dois rester la nuit

// Over The Next Hill //

Forever, forever the road goes on forever

If your wheels are burning up the miles
And you're wearing down shoe leather
And your face is frozen in a smile
And the road goes on forever

Forever, forever
The road goes on forever
Over the next hill
Maybe there's good weather

If you're flying over table top
Eyes wide with wine and wonder
Or lazy counting kangaroos
In the dingle days down under

Down under, down under
In dingle days down under
Over the next hill
There's no more rain or thunder

Though you chose the open road when you were willing
To sing and dance and take the tambourine and the shilling
All the secret tricks and footsteps you were learning
But once the stone begins to roll, it's not the turning

Like a rolling stone
With no direction home

Though you chose the open road when you were willing
To sing and dance and take the tambourine and the shilling
All the secret tricks and footsteps you were learning
But once the stone begins to roll, it's not the turning

Like a rolling stone
With no direction home

If you're pacing in the dressing room
Where there's no fresh paint or windows
Or you're strutting on some dusty stage
And wondering where the time goes

The time goes, the time goes
Wondering where the time goes
Over the next hill
They say there will be rainbows

Oh rainbows, rainbows
Somewhere over rainbows
Over the next hill
Who knows where the time goes

// I'm Already There //

Was homeward bound, one night on the deep
Swinging in my hammock I fell asleep

Across the ocean we set sail
It was a rough and mighty sea
Our strength and courage beat the gale
Till our ship she landed free

I sail my vessel for my lord in Banbury
So no come to harm
It was my calling from the start my destiny
In a sea of calm

And I dream at night
Of those frozen waves
Of that curtained sky
In its shimmering state

Land of great white bears
Across that crystal flow
And the snow flakes fall
I'm already there

At Hudson bay we made out camp
To heal our wounds and take on stores
With native Indians as our guides
We found the copper mine shore

We headed down through Canada
Our bow was breaking through the ice
But it got thicker when we stopped
Held in a frozen vice

I wonder how you are, across the mighty sea
Through the turquoise spray
And all the people that you meet, a lot like me
Is there much to say

And I dream at night
Of those frozen waves
And that curtained sky
In its shimmering state

Land of great white bears
Across that crystal flow
Like the snowflakes fall
I'm already there

Franklin said he had to leave
And take our chance with dog and sled
I thought of you and hoped you pray for me
We are brothers come what may

So much good will
Out in the streets of this old town
As people ask your name

So many thoughts my humble prayers
Go out to you
On that ice bound plain

And I dream at night
Of those frozen waves
Of that curtained sky
In its shimmering state

Land of great white bears
Across that crystal flow
Like the snowflakes fall
I'm already there

// Wait For The Tide To Come In //

There's a time I remember
When I tired to be free
I fought like a lion
But I couldn't see
That I was a loser
Before I fired the very first shot
And a back row seat in life
Was all I got

It was all right protesting
I could see it wearing thin
So I walk along the back roads
Waiting for the tide to come in

So the baliff makes you
A traveling man
You swap your house
For a Bedford Van
The countryside I closed
The law wont let you move
They'll push you through the country
What are they tryin' to prove

When you've no harm
Committed no big sin
Just get out along the back roads
And wait for the tide to come in

Hold on
Do you believe the politicians?
Hold on
Do you really think they'll listen
Hold on
Fighting to see it through

Hold back
Before you make a big decision
Hold back
They'll strain to see your vision
Hold back
Don't believe what you read in the news

As you grow older
You gotta realize
You've gotta bend a little
You've got to compromise
And get out on the back roads
Stay off the highway line
Ooh stay while no lies
You will see it come in time

They can't keep you down forever
Their wedge is wearing thin
So get out on the back roads
And wait for the tide to come in

There was a time I remember
When I tried to be free
I fought like a lion
But I couldn't see
That I was a loser
Before I fired the very first shot
And a back row seat in life
Was all I got

It was all right protecting
I could see it wearing thin
So I walk along the back roads
And wait for the tide to come in

Yeah I walk along the backroads
And wait for the tide to come in

// Over The Falls //

Won't you save me
Engage me
Don't evade me
Persuade me

He's standing on the edge
Looking out across the flow
He puts his feet up to the wire
To feel the tension with his toe

Now he knows the time is right
A final dust of chalk on hand
A certain dryness in his mouth
Everything is how he planned

A hush goes round the watching crowd
They hold their breath beneath the mist
A pair of eyes look to his face
A gasp from lips that he's just kissed

She hoped that he would change the ways
She prays that God is on his side
A glance to heaven for a sign
She knows this water is so wide

I have to walk a similar line
Across this twisted breed of love
With every step I fear I'll fall
No one to catch me from above
So hold me tight here in your arms
When winds of change can blow
You are my balance on the wire

The roaring canyon calls him on
The pole now held across his chest
While rainbows play across the sun
He puts his muscle to the test

He edges out into the void
Cameras click to catch the sight
No going back, just straight ahead
Between the darkness and the light

Won't you save me
Engage me
Don't evade me
Persuade me

Won't you save me
Engage me
Don't evade me
Persuade me

Hold me tight here in your arms
When winds of change can blow
You are my balance on the wire

As if a diamond held his gaze
Above Niagara's loudest roar
Treading softly with his soul now
To reach where he's not been before

Now he's standing on the edge
Looking back across the flow
Seems like he's walked a million miles

I have to walk a similar line
Across this twisted breed of love
With every step I fear I'll fall
No one to catch me from above
So hold me tight here in your arms
When winds of change can blow
You are my balance on the wire
You are my balance on the wire
You are my balance on the wire

// The Wassail Song //

Wassail and wassail all over the town
Our cup it is white and our ale it is brown
Our wassail is made of the good ale and true
Some nutmeg and ginger, the best that we could brew

It's your wassail and it's our wassail
Love and joy come to you and our jolly wassail

It's your wassail and it's our wassail
Love and joy come to you and our jolly wassail

Our wassail is made of an elderberry bough
And so my good neighbour, we'll drink unto thou
Besides all on earth, we have apples in store
Let us come in for it's cold by the door

It's your wassail, it's our wassail
Love and joy come to you and your jolly wassail

We know by the sky that we are not too high
We know by the stars that we are not too far
We know by the moon that we are not too soon
We know by the ground that we are within sound

It's your wassail, it's our wassail
Love and joy come to you and your jolly wassail

It's your wassail, it's our wassail
Love and joy come to you and your jolly wassail

// The Fossil Hunter //

A small girl is holding a carpenter's hand
Their eyes are looking down on the sand
Down on the sand
Holding a pebble that she's found
He shows her secrets in this jewel from the ground
This jewel in the ground

She sells shells upon the sea shore
Things slip through her hands so fast
She won't find love anymore
Not find love anymore

The wind tells tales in sails and masts
The girl's a woman now, her childhood past
Her childhood's past
She sells her finds to those who'll buy
Lends a hand to those who try
To those who try

She sells shells upon the sea shore
Things slip through her hands so fast
She won't find love anymore
Not find love anymore

Winter's fury throws waves ashore
An unchanged flow of an ancient law
This ancient law
Black then gives way to liquid jaws
Millions of years to settle a score
They settle a score

She sells shells upon the sea shore
Things slip through her hands so fast
She won't find love anymore
Not find love anymore

Walking to a spot she knows
Where the land has slipped again
A hammer held tight in her hand
She works on in the rain

A lighthouse beam moves into the sea
She moves the earth so patiently
So patiently
A landmark of history she will find
Her father's face appears in her mind
He comes to her mind

She sells shells upon the sea shore
Things slip through her hands so fast
She won't find love anymore
Not find love anymore

Mary is running by the sea
Mary is running by the sea
Mary is running by the sea
Mary is running by the sea...

// Willow Creek //

Over the brow she came low on a nut brown mare
She and the mare as one, just like the mane was her hair
Loud were the the hoof beats, hard beating just as one
Pounding past where I stood pounding the earth like a drum

I swear she called my name, just when I caught her eye
That's when she stole my heart as she went thundering by
Down to the water's edge, down where the willows weep
Pausing not one blink, over in one mighty leap

Up through the wooded slopes on then to stand and stare
Trying to catch a glimpse of the girl on the nut brown mare
Between the dappled leaps, swifter than any dart
Trying to mouth the words: "Hey, bring me back my heart"

Along the road they came, five of King George's men
Blood on their silver spurs tell us the way that she went
Down at the willow creek above the waters flow
Pointing away down stream, that was the way I saw her go

Off like the hounds of hell splashing along the stream
Pinching my very skin to know that it wasn't all a dream
Upon the highest ridge something caught my eye
The girl on the nut brown mare was waving to me against the sky

Hey bring me back my heart, how did she know my name?
Scrambling up the slope trying to reach her all in vain
Hey bring me back my heart, how did she know my name?
The girl on the nut brown mare, I'll never see her again

// Westward //

I've got my eye on an acre of land
I've got a lush life ahead of me planned

I'm looking out Westward
I'm going home Westward

They promised you silver, they promised you gold
Not one word of truth in the lies that they told

I'm looking out Westward
I'm going home Westward

I'm going home where the air is cleaner
And a word's as good as true
And I'm going home where the grass is greener
And a heart has a purpose too

I've set my heart on that acre of land
With all of that good life ahead of me planned
I'll be counting my money and counting the days
'Til I've got the ticket to take me away

I'm looking out Westward
I'm going home Westward
I'm looking out Westward
I'm going home Westward

I've got my eye on an acre of land
I've got a lush life ahead of me planned
I've got my eye on an acre of land
I've got a lush life ahead of me planned

I've got my eye on an acre of land
I've got a lush life ahead of me planned

// Auld Lang Syne //

Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And days of auld lang syne?

For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll tak a cup o' kindness yet
For sake of auld lang syne
