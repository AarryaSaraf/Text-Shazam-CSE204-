I want clear water from here to the horizon
I want some calm sea for the journey still ahead
Fair weather as we head for the skyline
A clear sky in the morning and every sunset red

I want clear water as we sail out to the edge
All I want to hear is the ripple from the bow
Let us be at ease now and know our true position
Like a compass to the star, like a team hooked to the plough

And as for all the history, best it's left unwritten
Few would believe if we told all we have seen
Comedy and tragedy have come along unbidden
They are the port and starboard that we've sailed in between

I want clear water for each new destination
And if the storm should break, we will take it in our stride
We rode out the tempest when the clouded stars were hidden
And the rising of the moon proved to be a fickle guide

And if we hear the timbers creak, it will be the give and take
Of forces from outside, we know our craft is strong
As long as we can speak without raising our voices
The music of the storm is in the calming of the song

At night upon the deck I want to feel the salty spray
Like warm tears on my face for the passing of the day
And I watch the wheeling star 'til the light breaks in the east
May the journey never end, let us be at peace

I want clear water from here to the horizon
Maybe scarred and battered, but who'll say we were wrong
When the journey not the goal was the only thing that mattered
While the wounds you thought had healed could still be opened by a song

I want clear water from here to the horizon
I want some calm sea for the journey still ahead
Fair weather as we head for the skyline
A clear sky in the morning and every sunset red
A clear sky in the morning and every sunset red
