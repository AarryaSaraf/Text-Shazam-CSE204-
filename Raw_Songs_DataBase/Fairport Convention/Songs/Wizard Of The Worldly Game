For seven years I've stood right here
And the flowers grow green by day
All for the yarns that I was told
I spread my arms when they grew cold
And warded off the rain
The bigger the tree, the deeper the roots
The grass that is trodden underfoot
Give it time and it will surely rise again

I'm rocked by winds and I'm soaked by rains
And I'll bow and sometimes bend
Until I fall and crush the forms
Of a few small friends who stood through storms
And who will rise again
The bigger the tree, the deeper the roots
The grass that is trodden underfoot
Give it time and it will surely rise again

It's laughter dust, the Derby's just
Be do be law be done
Wile to win and wise to pain
Wizard of the worldly game
Treasoned into trust
The bigger the tree, the deeper the roots
The grass that is trodden underfoot
Give it time and it will surely rise again
