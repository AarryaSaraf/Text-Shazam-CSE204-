Deep and dark are my true love's eyes
Blacker still is the winter turning
As the sadness of parting proves
And brighter now is the lantern burning
That lightens my path to her

No fiddle tune will take the air
But I'll see her swift feet a-dancing
And the swirl of her long brown hair
Her smiling face and her dark eyes glancing
As we stepped up from Banbury Fair

If my waiting prove in vain
Then I'll pack and track ever take me
And the long road will ease my pain
No jewelled mankind will ever make me
Whisper love's words again

For in drink I'll seek good company
My ears will ring with the tavern's laughter
And I'll hear not her last sweet sigh
And who's to know in the morning after
How I long for her dear dark eyes
And I long for her dear dark eyes
How I long for her dear dark eyes
