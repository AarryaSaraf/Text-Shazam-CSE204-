Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
Come down and show us what's wrong

When every word's been sung or spoken
And bygone battles have been lost or won
When all is mended that once was broken
Who crawled will surely run
And when all our creeds and all of our deeds
Are centered on each other's needs
When men are mending harmonies
The world will have begun

Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
Are you really real, do you love every one?
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
Come down and show us what's wrong

If the sins of the father are also the son's
What chance do we have in this game
Everything's blacker, we argue with guns
With money we burn and we maim
And is it all for a reason, this game without end
To be rich, you have to have poor
And is feasting to famine like sitting to standing
Or is there a hole in God's door?

Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
Are you really real, do you love every one?
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
Come down and show us what's wrong

Matthew, Mark, Luke and Paul
Are your fingers in your ears, can you hear us at all
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
Come down and show us what's wrong
