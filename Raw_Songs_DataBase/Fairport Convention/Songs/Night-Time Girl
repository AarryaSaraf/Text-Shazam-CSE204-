Night-time girl, rocking in a chair
Whiles her time away combing up her yellow hair
Night-time girl, rocking in a chair
Looking in the mirror with a wide eyed stare

Night-time girl, when she's eager for the city
Dresses for the ball and she looks so young and pretty
Night-time girl, when she's eager for the city
Dresses for the ball and she looks so young and pretty

Night-time girl, there's a place they want to put you
Night-time girl, they say you're insane
Night-time girl, they tell me you're crazy
Isn't that a crying shame

Night-time girl, maybe all these changes
Are stages of what I'm hoping
Hard luck girl, your peace of mind
Must seem a long time coming

Night-time girl, there's a place they want to put you
Night-time girl, they say you're insane
Night-time girl, they tell me you're crazy
Isn't that a crying shame

Night-time girl, rocking in a chair
Whiles her time away combing up her yellow hair
Night-time girl, rocking in a chair
Looking in a mirror with a wide eyed stare

Night-time girl, they tell me you're crazy
Night-time girl, they say you're insane
Night-time girl, there's a place they want to put you
Isn't that a crying shame
