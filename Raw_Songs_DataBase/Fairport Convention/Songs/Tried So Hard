Stopped awhile this morning on my way back home
I had to realize this time that I'd be all alone
'Cause she's moving somewhere far away not slow
And though I tried so hard to please her
She said she really had to go

Even though this time it really hurts me bad
I've been through similarities
It's not the first break I've had
Just can't let it bring me down too low
'Cause I tried so hard to please her
There must be something more to know

Never thought that we would find our end this way
It seemed that everything was going fine
Still with all the things that I can do or say
It won't change the fate I know so well is mine

So I'll stop again and look right past the pain
Because I've been in love before and I can love again
While she's moving somewhere far away not slow
Although I tried so hard to please her
She said she really had to go

Stopped awhile this morning on my way back home
I had to realize this time that I'd be all alone
'Cause she's moving somewhere far away not slow
And though I tried so hard to please her
She said she really had to go
