She's a lady of pleasure, she's a lady of joy
And she has no illusions of grandeur
You can get what you want when your money's up front
She's a sailor-lad's port in a storm
A sailor-lad's port in a storm
To some she's a sweetheart, to some she's a whore
And to others she's there to come home to
Well, she knows the score 'cause she's done it all before
Just knock and she'll open the door
Knock and she'll open the door
"Oh, where are you going, my fine feathered friend?
Have you someone to sleep with tonight?
If you're willing to pay, you'll have somewhere to stay
I've a nice place a short haul away
It's only a short haul away"
There's some makes it easy, there's some makes it hard
And there's some try to keep it a secret
But she's there on the tide, she's just out for a ride
And you know she's got nothing to hide
Nothing at all to hide
'Cause she's a lady of pleasure, she's a lady of joy
And she has no illusions of grandeur
You can get what you want when your money's up front
She's a sailor-lad's port in a storm
A sailor-lad's port in a storm
