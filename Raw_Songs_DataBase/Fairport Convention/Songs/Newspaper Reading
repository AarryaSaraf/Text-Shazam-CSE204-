The customary quiet of Babbacombe, a residential suburb of Torquay, was greatly disturbed early on Saturday morning
And the peaceful inhabitants were aroused to a state of intense alarm and terror by one of the greatest tragedies that human devilment could plan or human deed could perpetrate
The name of the victim was Miss Emma Anne Whitehead Keyes, an elderly lady of some sixty-eight years
The name of her home and the scene of her tragedy, was 'The Glen'
She was found early in the morning, lying on her dining room floor
Her throat had been horribly cut and there were three wounds on her head
It was evident that her murderer had also attempted to burn the corpse
