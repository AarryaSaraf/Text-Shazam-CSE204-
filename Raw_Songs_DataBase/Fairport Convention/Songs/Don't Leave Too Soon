Don't leave too soon, don't say goodbye yet
Your gaze is quiet and misty as if your course is set
But there's life in this party, there's a bright harvest moon
Friend of mine, see it shine, don't leave too soon

Don't leave too soon, I know it feels late
And evening's a mask in shadows, the seasons do not wait
But laughter still rings here, it can light up the room
So fix your eyes on the sweet sunrise, don't leave too soon

Oh, haven't we still got songs to sing, new colours every day
Now is not the time to disappear into the grey

Don't leave too soon, don't tell me you're tired
Your heart still has the magic, your eyes still have the fire
While there's pride and there's music, add your voice to the tune
Sweet trusted one I'm counting on, don't leave too soon
Oh, sweet trusted one I'm counting on, don't leave too soon

Haven't we still got songs to sing
Haven't we still got songs to sing
Haven't we still got songs to sing
Haven't we still got songs to sing
Haven't we still got songs to sing
