General Taylor gained the day
Walk him along, John, carry him along
General Taylor gained the day
Carry him to his burying ground

To me way, hey, hey Stormy
Walk him along, John, carry him along
Way, hey, hey, Stormy

Carry him to his burying ground
I wish I was sold Stormy's son

Walk him along, John, carry him along
I'd build me a ship of ten thousand ton
Carry him to his burying ground

To me way, hey, hey Stormy
Walk him along, John, carry him along
Way, hey, hey, Stormy

I'd load her down with ale and rum
Walk him along, John, carry him along
And every shellback should have some
Carry him to his burying ground

To me way, hey, hey Stormy
Walk him along, John, carry him along
Way, hey, hey, Stormy

We dug his grave with a silver spade
Walk him along, John, carry him along
His shroud of the finest silk was made

To me way, hey, hey Stormy
Walk him along, John, carry him along
Way, hey, hey, Stormy

We lowered him down on a golden chain
Walk him along, John, carry him along
On every link we carved his name
Carry him to his burying ground

To me way, hey, hey Stormy
Walk him along, John, carry him along
Way, hey, hey, Stormy

General Taylor died long ago
Walk him along, John, carry him along
He's gone to where the winds don't blow
Carry him to his burying ground

To me way, hey, hey Stormy
Walk him along, John, carry him along
Way, hey, hey, Stormy
