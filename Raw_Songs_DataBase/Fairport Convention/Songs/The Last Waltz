The party's all over, it's time to go
It's time to go
This party's all over, it's time to be gone
It's time to go

The time it is late and I wish we could stay, but
It's time to go
We'll all meet again on some other day
It's time to go

Goodbye to the girls, aye, goodbye to you all
It's time to go
Farewell to the dancing, farewell to the ball
It's time to go

And the door's always open, so come again soon
It's time to go
Let's round off the night with a sprightly tune
It's time to go

So dance to your doorsteps and dance up the stairs
It's time to go
Dance into bed and dance away there
It's time to go

This party's all over, it's time to go
It's time to go
The party's all over, it's time to be gone
It's time to go
