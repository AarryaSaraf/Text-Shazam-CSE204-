One, two, three

Turn around, don't whisper out my name
Like a breeze, it would stir a dying flame
I'll miss someone, if it eases you to know
And close the door lightly when you go

Who was the one that stole my mind?
Who was the one that robbed my time?
Who was the one who made me feel unkind?
See you on the road, sweet love of mine

Take your tears from someone else's eyes
They're made of glass
And they cut like wounded knives
Memories, they're drifting like the snow
And close the door lightly when you go

Who was the one that stole my mind?
Who was the one that robbed my time?
Who was the one who made me feel unkind?
See you on the road, sweet love of mine

Who was the one that stole my mind?
Who was the one that robbed my time?
Who was the one who made me feel unkind?
See you on the road, sweet love of mine

Turn around, don't whisper out my name
For like a breeze, it would stir a dying flame
I'll miss someone, if it eases you to know
And close the door lightly when you go
