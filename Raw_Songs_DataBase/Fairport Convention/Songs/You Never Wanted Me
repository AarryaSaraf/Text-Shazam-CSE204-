Wondering and waiting, my back against the wall
Not a word that passed between us comes to recall
Just your shadow at the window as you pass on down the hall
You never wanted me and never knew me at all

I haven't any picture to set before my eyes
Nothing I can blame when the blues start to rise
Just the memory of laughter and a living out of lies
But if I could change my ways we would never have said goodbye

If you ever get the time, please think of me
It's a lock that can't be broken and there isn't any key
I'm only in your mind, only you can set me free
You can't hurt me anymore and it isn't hard to see

Someday, someone will leave you and I know you'll feel the same
But you'll mark it down to memory and a dream that never came
But there are no answers given when love is just a game
And you never wanted me and now I feel the same
