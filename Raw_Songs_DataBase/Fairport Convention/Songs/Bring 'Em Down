Time stood dark and silent and the stars they gave no light
I wandered in an endless dream, haunted by the night
I saw four ghostly riders, the horses in a line
Each in turn did point at me and say I'm on full rein
We are the sculptors of the land, the rulers of the sea
We are the falcons of your sins, gardeners of the trees
The air about you is burning and the sea below does drown
And the legacy you leave your swan will surely bring 'em down
Bring 'em down, bring 'em down, bring 'em down
Bring 'em down, bring 'em down, bring 'em down

A curse upon you men of war, with gun or pen in hand
The power sword or  the castles made of sand
You always have good reason to take more than you need
Your hearts are full of paper and your minds are full of greed
Bring 'em down, bring 'em down, bring 'em down
Bring 'em down, bring 'em down, bring 'em down

What is deeper than the ocean, colder than the grave
Stronger than your armies all and braver than the brave?
Those who know and knowing know will sow on fertile ground
Those who don't and never would are those you will go down
Bring 'em down, bring 'em down, bring 'em down
Bring 'em down, bring 'em down, bring 'em down
