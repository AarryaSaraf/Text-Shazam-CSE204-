Called for this place with my working hands
Sea crossing turn my inside
Left to the sound of the marching band
We sail at the change of the tide

When I saw Mary, her father said
He was sailing across the deep blue
Brighter new days in a promised land
She would be going there too

So I keep her in my mind
There's a picture on my wall
Oh, my love is in America
My love could be anywhere at all

Oh, how we cried on that darkest night
Everyone leaving the land
The old generation just sitting tight
And all of us young bucks with plans

I'm using the name of another man
To get a job here for more pay
I'll walk these strange streets for a better life
London's the place, so they say

And I keep her in my mind
There's a picture on my wall
Oh, my love, she's in America
My love could be anywhere at all
Anywhere at all...

The music's the one thing that's travelled well
We meet up and play from our soul
The kitchen, the work yard and the Seven Bells
Gives us a glimpse of our homes

Maybe I'll make it to New York state
Maybe I'll just up and go
Maybe I'll get back to my hometown
See if there's work, I don't know

I sent many a letter to no avail
Her silence is deafening to me
Maybe she lives with another man
Crossing the new country

Till I know, I keep her in my mind
There's a picture on my wall
Oh, my love is in America
My love could be anywhere at all...
