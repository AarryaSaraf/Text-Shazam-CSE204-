Still at school, hand of fate
On a radio show one night so late
Teacher's words didn't inspire
But he heard some truth in the wood and the wire

In a high street window it winked and beckoned
Turned his head in a single second
First month's wage, heart's desire
Under the spell of the wood and the wire

The wood and the wire can clam a man
Dreams in his fingers, power in his hands
Louder than laughter, brighter than fire
The promise that lives in the wood and the wire

Every night through the bedroom door
Every heart-throb's favourite score
Singing to his only one
All the songs that ever sung

Soaking It up like it was spilt
Every note with every hit
Even the mirror no longer a liar
Caught his moves in the wood and the wire

The wood and the wire can clam a man
Dreams in his fingers, power in his hands
Louder than laughter, brighter than fire
The promise that lives in the wood and the wire

Wheels turn round, years go by
Dreams that live and dreams that die
Hopes get swallowed by those cracks
Tears he sheds with words he lacks
Head won't rise from the mire
But It all makes sense with the wood and the wire

The wood and the wire cuts through rules
Hope to the lonely sense to the fools
Love to the stranger, truth to the liar
You've got the means with the wood and the wire

The wood and the were cuts through rules
Hope to the lonely, sense to the fools
Love to the stranger, truth to the liar
Well you've got the means with the wood and the wire

The wood and the wire can clam a man
Dreams in his fingers, power in his hands
Louder than laughter, brighter than fire
The promise that lives in the wood and the wire
