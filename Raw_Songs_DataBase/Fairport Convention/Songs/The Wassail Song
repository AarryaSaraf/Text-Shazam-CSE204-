Wassail and wassail all over the town
Our cup it is white and our ale it is brown
Our wassail is made of the good ale and true
Some nutmeg and ginger, the best that we could brew

It's your wassail and it's our wassail
Love and joy come to you and our jolly wassail

It's your wassail and it's our wassail
Love and joy come to you and our jolly wassail

Our wassail is made of an elderberry bough
And so my good neighbour, we'll drink unto thou
Besides all on earth, we have apples in store
Let us come in for it's cold by the door

It's your wassail, it's our wassail
Love and joy come to you and your jolly wassail

We know by the sky that we are not too high
We know by the stars that we are not too far
We know by the moon that we are not too soon
We know by the ground that we are within sound

It's your wassail, it's our wassail
Love and joy come to you and your jolly wassail

It's your wassail, it's our wassail
Love and joy come to you and your jolly wassail
