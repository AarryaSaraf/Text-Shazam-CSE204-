You're gonna need, you're gonna need my help, I say
You're gonna need, you're gonna need my help, I say
You know I won't have to worry, I'll have everything goin' my way

You wake up in the morning, your face so full of frowns
Asked you: 'What's wrong?', you say: 'I'm sorry, I'm puttin' you down'

You're gonna need, you're gonna need my help, I say
You know I won't have to worry 'cause I'll have everything goin' my way

Well, you leave home in the morning and you won't come back tonight
You won't give me no food, you still say you treat me right

You're gonna need, you're gonna need my help, I say
You know I won't have to worry 'cause I'll have everything goin' my way

You're gonna need, you're gonna need my help, I say
You're gonna need, you're gonna need my help, I say
You know I won't have to worry 'cause I'll have everything goin' my way

Well, you wake up in the morning, your face so full of frowns
Asked you: 'What's wrong?', you say: 'I'm sorry, I'm puttin' you down'

Well, you're gonna need, you're gonna need my help, I say
You know I won't have to worry 'cause I'll have everything goin' my way
