Beautiful dreamer lays in her bed
Wonderful visions go round in her head
Her father has told her the stories of old
Of princes and ladies and diamonds and gold

Lets take a photograph, pictures don't lie
Her long hair so golden, the blue of her eye

She taunts and she teases the boys in her school
They don't understand, they don't know her rules
Soon she'll be leaving to get on a train
With mirror and makeup, for fortune and fame

Lets take a photograph, pictures don't lie
Clutching her suitcase, she waves us goodbye

He comes from the shadows, with a gleam in his eye
And a golden medallion your money can't buy
He takes her to Soho and he takes her up West
He fills her with lines, he's rehearsed all the best

Now I'll give you diamonds and I'll give you gold
You'll live the stories your father has told
So he gives her the diamonds that she sniffs from a spoon
And he leaves her on satin in some darkened room

So the boys can take photographs, pictures don't lie
You'll never leave here, don't even try

So she looks at the river, so deep and so cold
Just one more victim of diamonds and gold
Just one more victim of diamonds and gold
Just one more victim of diamonds and gold
