Oh, come all you weary travellers
Let us take time from our journey
A few moments long
Through the way all tribulation
In the cooling breath of silence
At the heart of a song
The heart of the song

As we journey through mountains in pursuit of our dreams
How we hurry to capture the tide
Catching glimpses of valleys of tumbling streams
Where we'll stop someday when we have time

Oh, come all you weary travellers
Let us take time from our journey
A few moments long
If we lose sight of each other
I will meet you in a silence
At the heart of a song
The heart of the song

All those questions in despair that discomfort your mind
From a torrent you give for one sign
There may not be the answer you've been hoping to find
But the questions will glitter and shine

Like the starry eyes of lovers
And the moon beneath the waters
Where the magic is drawn
If we lose sight of each other
I will meet you in a silence
At the heart of a song
The heart of the song
