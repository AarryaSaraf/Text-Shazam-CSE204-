Was homeward bound, one night on the deep
Swinging in my hammock I fell asleep

Across the ocean we set sail
It was a rough and mighty sea
Our strength and courage beat the gale
Till our ship she landed free

I sail my vessel for my lord in Banbury
So no come to harm
It was my calling from the start my destiny
In a sea of calm

And I dream at night
Of those frozen waves
Of that curtained sky
In its shimmering state

Land of great white bears
Across that crystal flow
And the snow flakes fall
I'm already there

At Hudson bay we made out camp
To heal our wounds and take on stores
With native Indians as our guides
We found the copper mine shore

We headed down through Canada
Our bow was breaking through the ice
But it got thicker when we stopped
Held in a frozen vice

I wonder how you are, across the mighty sea
Through the turquoise spray
And all the people that you meet, a lot like me
Is there much to say

And I dream at night
Of those frozen waves
And that curtained sky
In its shimmering state

Land of great white bears
Across that crystal flow
Like the snowflakes fall
I'm already there

Franklin said he had to leave
And take our chance with dog and sled
I thought of you and hoped you pray for me
We are brothers come what may

So much good will
Out in the streets of this old town
As people ask your name

So many thoughts my humble prayers
Go out to you
On that ice bound plain

And I dream at night
Of those frozen waves
Of that curtained sky
In its shimmering state

Land of great white bears
Across that crystal flow
Like the snowflakes fall
I'm already there
