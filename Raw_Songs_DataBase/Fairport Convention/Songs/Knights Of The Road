Set out from Carlisle with the sun beside him
Sinking low across an empty field
Old moon a-rising, the first lone star a-shining
Shadows rolling down the lonely hills

Run down by Lichfield and the rain it started pouring
Water flowing up along the road
Listen to the rumble of the ten big wheels a-turning
Listen for the shifting of the load.

Knights of the road, riders of the highways
Hauling the load, making it the hard way

Miles crack on by and he sang with his engines
Old tunes like "Kisses sweeter than wine"
Dreaming of the girl he'd be lying with at sunrise
Another lonely milestone passed him by

Knights of the road, riders of the highways
Hauling the load, making it the hard way

Lightning it crashed and he never saw it coming
They found him with his hands still at the wheel
Just another poor boy trying to keep 'em running
He died lugging 30 tons of steel

Knights of the road, riders of the highways
Making it the hard way
