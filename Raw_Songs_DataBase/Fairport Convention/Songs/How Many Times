You broke my heart so many times that I can't count the pieces
Every time you push me down, it seems my love increases
How many times do you have to fall, while others stand there gawking?
How many times do you have to fall, before you end up walking?

I tried to give you all I have, to prove that I'm not bluffing
They say it's a man with nothing to lose who winds up losing nothing
My head is full of dreams and schemes and my tongue tied up from talking
How many times do you have to fall, before you end up walking?

I tried to give you all I have, I thought our love was strong
I always thought I'd treat you right, how did I get you wrong?
Won't you even open up the door to see the wares I'm hawking?
How many times do you have to fall, before you end up walking?

Won't you give me one more chance? I couldn't do much worse
I emptied out my heart for you before it has to burst
I'm too hungry not to wait, you're the game I'm stalking
How many times do you have to fall, before you end up walking?
