London River, oh the London River
All the love I have I'll give her
London River, oh the London River
That's the river for me

First time that I set my eyes upon her
Tell no lie, upon my honour
Sights and sounds that made my heart a-shiver
Then I saw her on the London River...

London River, oh the London River
All the love I have I'll give her
London River, oh the London River
That's the river for me

Signed to my master in the 1930s
The hours were long and the work was dirty
Out in the indies where the Rum is brewed
Had me a drop and got me kidneys too

London River, oh the London River
All the love I have I'll give her
London River, oh the London River
That's the river for me

Signed for a while on the old rasover
Some of them stewards they'll blow you over
Lipstick and Makeup, and all that muck
Walk like a woman and they call you duck

London River, oh the London River
All the love I have I'll give her
London River, oh the London River
That's the river for me

First time that I set my eyes upon her
Tell no lie, upon my honour
Sights and sounds that made my heart a-shiver
Then I saw her on the London River...

London River, oh the London River
All the love I have I'll give her
London River, oh the London River
That's the river for me
