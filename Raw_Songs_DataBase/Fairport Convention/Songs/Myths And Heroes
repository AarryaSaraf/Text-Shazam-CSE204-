Oh Romulus and Remus
Were you really so uncool?
You suckled from the she wolf
Did you think you had her fooled?
The seven hills triumphant
It was never going to last
As the laurel started fading
To a glory of the past

Look up to the sky at night
And tell me what you see
Lovers fly across the dark
Fulfill their destiny
And others more enduring
Just look out into the void
They see our empires come and go
All hope and fear destroyed

Look out on the fields now
Walk out to the plain
Look up for a shooting star
It'll never come again

Walking, talking, dying, loving
Making up your mind
Can these fragments be connected?
Then what might we find?
What might we find?

Oh is it really possible
A footprint on the moon?
A million dollar mandolin
That played a bluegrass tune?
A wall that so divided us
Brought down by people's will
A yearly hope for peace on earth
We're waiting for it still
