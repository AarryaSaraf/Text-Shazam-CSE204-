Evening's dawning, missed the morning
Slept the afternoon
Half the day's gone, still I laze on
Got no silver spoon

But there's someone out there somewhere
Some girl with my other side
She won't know me, but she'll show me
How to treat another heart

Life is bedlam if you let them
Kick and put you down
They will race you, beat, disgrace you
Push your face into the ground

But you can get out of there somehow
She will show you how it's done
She's no lady, but she made me
Feel that I need a crown

I'll repay her and convey her
My realities
She'll respond with, condescend with
Trivialities

For she doesn't have to think of
For too long to read my mind
She's a winner, no beginner
She's a friend of mine
