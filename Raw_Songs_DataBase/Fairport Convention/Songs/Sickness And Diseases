I do hate to see a rover crippled in the stones
Now he's one step nearer to the ground
And I do hate to see a hawker broken in the bones

Sickness and diseases pull you down, pull you down
Sickness and diseases pull you down

Everybody's got the sickness, everybody's down
Running to the doctor with a pound
"Doctor, doctor, do you have a needle big enough for me?"

Sickness and diseases pull you down, pull you down
Sickness and diseases pull you down

Sickness and diseases pull you down, pull you down
Sickness and diseases pull you down

My friend Billy, well he looks so ill, his face is white as milk
Everybody runs for miles when he's in town
He's got every known disease and some without a name

Sickness and diseases pull you down, pull you down
Sickness and diseases pull you down

If you want to live to be a poor man or a prince
Pay good attention when evil times abound
Always listen to what your mother says and stay in bed at night

Sickness and diseases pull you down, pull you down
Sickness and diseases pull you down

Sickness and diseases pull you down, pull you down
Sickness and diseases pull you down
