I heard a voice calling out to me
It might have been a vision, might have been a dream
But some things will come and some will go
We're only here a moment, don't you know?

And I don't think that I've all the answers
But I've got my share of questions
If I don't follow blindly
It doesn't mean I've lost my way
Because I'm still on a journey
Heading down a road less travelled
I think we're all going to get there
In our own time and way
Time and way

There's a bridge that leads us to the other side
You will know you've crossed it when you arrive
And everyone will have such a tale to tell
I'm going to quench my thirst when I drink from that well

And I don't think that I've all the answers
But I've got my share of questions
If I don't follow blindly
It doesn't mean I've lost my way
Because I'm still on a journey
Heading down a road less travelled
I think we're all going to get there
In our own time and way...

I heard a voice calling out to me
It might have been a vision, might have been a dream
But some things will come and some will go
We're only here a moment, don't you know?

And I don't think that I've all the answers
But I've got my share of questions
If I don't follow blindly
It doesn't mean I've lost my way
Because I'm still on a journey
Heading down a road less travelled
I think we're all going to get there
In our own time and way
I think we're all going to get there
In our own time and way
Our time and way...
