Things come up and bring you mixed emotion
I'm talking about her, talking about her
Tossed around like a boat out on the ocean
I'm talking about my love

I could sail around the seven seas
Never reach the shore
With my rudder set on an even keel
Ropes held tight and the danger real
Drifting sometimes away
It feel, I'm sure

Things come up and bring you mixed emotion
I'm talking about her, talking about her
Tossed around like a boat out on the ocean
I'm talking about my love

If you don't know how the day will end
There be troubles 'round the world
No one knows much about it
You can't say much about it
Sun or wind, hail or rain
Just bring us back to, still I pray

I could force ya home with an iron will
It's tempered through to blue
With a heavy hammer for my heart
Beating 'round those fiery sparks
Cooling all the while
As lovers do

Things come up and bring you mixed emotion
I'm talking about her, talking about her
Tossed around like a boat out on the ocean
I'm talking about my love

Things come up and bring you mixed emotion
I'm talking about her, talking about her
Tossed around like a boat out on the ocean
I'm talking about my love

Things come up... and bring you mixed emotion
I'm tossed around
When I'm talking about my love
