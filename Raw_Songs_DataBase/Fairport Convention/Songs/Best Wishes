Long may the sun shine on your bones and on your skin
Long may good fortune shine upon your kith and kin
Long may the laughter lines grow into your face
Long may you mastermind a perfect state of grace

May you always love and season well and keep good company
May you always act and reason well, wherever you may be
And long may the music keep you gentle and in thrall
And long may its beauty shine to pleasure one and all

Long may your passion take a stand against all wrongs
And long may the fashion last that welcomes all your songs
Long may your journey take you down a friendly road
And long may you learn the ways that lighten up your load

May you always keep good melody and never lose your key
May you always keep your memory and keep your spirit free
And long may the music keep you underneath its spell
And long may you keep it live and always play it well
