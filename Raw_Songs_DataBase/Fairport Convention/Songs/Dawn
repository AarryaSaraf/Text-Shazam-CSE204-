Morning shone among the shadows
Sunlight bled upon the silence
From the blackest night
Must come the morning sky
But yesterday was such a long time
Yesterday may last forever
From the barren land
Yesterday might always rise

Sleep, will we ever sleep
Oh, to sleep in peace once again my love

Tears are falling in the darkness
Hearts are bleeding in the silence
From the widest ocean
Who would miss this smallest tear
Then might always be a bad time
Then might always last forever
But these stormy clouds
We may see them all disappear

Hope has she really gone
Will she ever come back again my love

Sleep, will we ever sleep
Oh, to sleep in peace once again to love

Hope has she really gone
Will she ever come home again my love
