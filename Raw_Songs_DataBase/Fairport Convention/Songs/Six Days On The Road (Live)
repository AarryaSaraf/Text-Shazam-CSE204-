Well, I pulled out of Pittsburgh down the Eastern seaboard
I got my diesel wound up and she's a-running like never before
There's a speed zone ahead all right but I can't see a cop in sight
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

I got ten forward gears and a George Overdrive
I'm takin' little white pills and my eyes are opened wide
And I just passed a Jimmy and White, been passing everything in sight
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

Well, the FBI is checkin' on down the line
Well, I'm a little overweight but my log books way behind
But nothing bothers me tonight, I'm gonna dodge all the scales all right
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

Well, it seems like a month since I kissed my baby goodbye
I could have a lotta women but I'm not like some other guys
I could find me one to hold me tight but I could never make believe it's all right
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

My rigs a little old but that don't mean she's slow
There's a good flame blowing from her smoke stack black as coal
Well, my home town's coming in sight and if you think I'm happy you're right
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
