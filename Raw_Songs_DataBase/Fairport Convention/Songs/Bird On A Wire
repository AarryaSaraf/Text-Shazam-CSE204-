Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way
To be free

Like a worm on a hook
Like a knight from some old-fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons
For thee

If I have been unkind
I hope you will just let it go by
And if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was not unto you

Like a baby stillborn
Like a beast with its horns
I have torn everyone
Who reached out for me

And I swear by this song
And by all I have done wrong
That I will make it all
Up to thee

I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden cross
He said to me "do not ask for so much"
And a woman standing in her darkened door
She cried to me "hey, why not ask for more?"

Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way
To be free
