Over the brow she came low on a nut brown mare
She and the mare as one, just like the mane was her hair
Loud were the the hoof beats, hard beating just as one
Pounding past where I stood pounding the earth like a drum

I swear she called my name, just when I caught her eye
That's when she stole my heart as she went thundering by
Down to the water's edge, down where the willows weep
Pausing not one blink, over in one mighty leap

Up through the wooded slopes on then to stand and stare
Trying to catch a glimpse of the girl on the nut brown mare
Between the dappled leaps, swifter than any dart
Trying to mouth the words: "Hey, bring me back my heart"

Along the road they came, five of King George's men
Blood on their silver spurs tell us the way that she went
Down at the willow creek above the waters flow
Pointing away down stream, that was the way I saw her go

Off like the hounds of hell splashing along the stream
Pinching my very skin to know that it wasn't all a dream
Upon the highest ridge something caught my eye
The girl on the nut brown mare was waving to me against the sky

Hey bring me back my heart, how did she know my name?
Scrambling up the slope trying to reach her all in vain
Hey bring me back my heart, how did she know my name?
The girl on the nut brown mare, I'll never see her again
