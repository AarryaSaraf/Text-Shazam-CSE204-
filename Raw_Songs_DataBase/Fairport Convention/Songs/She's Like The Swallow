She's like the swallow that flies so high
She's like the river that never runs dry
She's like the sunshine on the lee shore
I love my love and love is no more

'Tis out in the garden this fair maid did go
A-picking the beautiful primrose
The more she plucked, the more she pulled
Until she's got her apron full

And it's out of these flowers she's made her bed
A stony pillow for her head
She's laid herself down, no word did she say
Until this fair maid's heart it did break

She's like the swallow that flies so high
She's like the river that never runs dry
She's like the sunshine on the lee shore
I love my love and love is no more
