Well I've been away such a long time now
And my life has changed so much
And I broke my promise that no matter how
I would always keep in touch
I could hear the whistle of the telephone wires
I could hear the trains roll by
If I can hear the whistle and the engine's whine
Why can't I hear you cry
That home is where the heart is

Who's that knocking on your front door?
Is it the friend that you never knew?
Well why don't you make sure
That home is where the heart is
Three short steps and I'll be there
Into the arms of the one you love
And never roam no more

Well you tracked me down to this foreign town
Your long distance call came through
And a voice that I'd not heard for years
Said, darlin', is that you?
And a voice of my own said, I'll be there
When I get these wheels to start
And it's not my promise that I'll break this time
But someone else's heart
'Cause home is where the heart is

Guess who's knocking at your front door?
Is it the friend that you never knew?
Well why don't you make sure
That home is where the heart is
Take those steps across the floor
Into the arms of the one who loves you
And never roam no more
