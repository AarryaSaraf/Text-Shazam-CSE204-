Look to the left then to the right
Down where you're walking
You're like a spark to dynamite
The way that you're talking

Every lover that you've ever known
Has tried to find someone inside
And there's tears unanswered on your telephone
So many places to hide
You're still a mystery

You're acting out the part and giving out the orders
There's footprints on your heart and ghosts on every corner
You run to the darkness and you touch the flame
To see who's coming out to play

You run one finger down your list of names
Who's going to get it today?
You're still a mystery
You're still a mystery

Stay out late on the tiles running loose
Acting wild - never worry
Take what's mine, give too much on the line
Need no crutch - end of story

Is this the person that I love
Or a shadow that I'm chasing?
Are those dark clouds up above
Or just the way I'm facing?

I tried hard to be the one you need
Holding out for what was true
With you dissatisfaction's guaranteed
Where can I go, what can I do?

You're still a mystery
You're still a mystery
Stop playing games with me
You're still a mystery
