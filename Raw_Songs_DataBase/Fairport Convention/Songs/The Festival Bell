1690 was the year, a bell was cast in Chacombe
William Bagley was the name, the foundry man the made them
With another five before, the lowest was a tenor
Settling for a six peal in the old church tower

There was such a gathering, all to bring the new year in
The captain of the ringers was a man named William Jack
300 years later now it's minor and major
Ringing with St. Mary and The Festival Bell

Hold on to the tenor when the treble it is going
Be sure to watch the changes now you know that she is gone
Look to sally for a clue, then you'll know just what to do
We'll have to have a silent bell 'cos Bob's not here

Is he in the Red Lion? Maybe in the Brasenose?
Funny but you'd think that he was practising from there
300 years later now it's minor and major
Ringing with St. Mary and The Festival Bell

So, still, in the tower waiting for the ringers
Centuries go by, still our voices sing

They ring throughout all Oxfordshire and out across the nation
Even in America, maybe Russia too
For every year in August there's another celebration
Peace and love, rock and roll, and Wadworth's too

Every act that takes the stage, all the music that is played
Is cast into a symbol in the old church tower
300 years later now it's minor and major
Ringing with St. Mary and The Festival Bell

Every act that takes the stage, all the music that is played
Is cast into a symbol in the old church tower
300 years later now it's minor and major
Ringing with St. Mary and The Festival Bell
Ringing with St. Mary and The Festival Bell
