Oh western wind when will thou blow
The small rain down can rain
And if my love were in my arms
And I in my bed again
And I in my bed again, and I in my bed again
And I in my bed again

Now western winds and slaughtering guns
Bring autumn's pleasant weather
The moorcock springs on whirring wings
Among the blooming heather

Now waving grain wild o'er the plain
Delights the weary farmer
The moon shines bright as I rove at night
To muse upon my charier

The partridge loves the fruitful fells
The plover loves the mountain
The woodcock haunts the lonely dells
The soaring hern the fountains

Through lofty groves the cushat roves
Tine path of man to shun it
The hazel bush o'erhangs the thrush
The spreading thorn the linnet

Thus every kind their pleasure find
The savage and the tender
Some social join, some leagues combine
And some solitary wander

Avaunt, away the cruel sway
Tyranme man's dommion
The sportsman's joy the murdering cry
The fluttering gory pinion

But Polly dear the evening's here
Swift flies the skimming swallow
The sky is blue, the field's in view
All fading green and yellow

Come let us stray our gladsome way
And view the charms of nature
The rustling corn the fruited thorn
And every happy creature

We'll gently talk and sweetly walk
Till the silent moon shines clearly
I'll grasp thy waist and fondly pressed
Swear how I love thee dearly

Not vernal showers to budding flowers
Not autumn to the farmer
So dear can be as thou to me
My fair, my lovely charmer

Oh western wind when will thou blow
The small rain down can rain
And if my love were in my arms
And I in my bed again
And I in my bed again
And I in my bed again
