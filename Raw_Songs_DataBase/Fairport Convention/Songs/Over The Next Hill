Forever, forever the road goes on forever

If your wheels are burning up the miles
And you're wearing down shoe leather
And your face is frozen in a smile
And the road goes on forever

Forever, forever
The road goes on forever
Over the next hill
Maybe there's good weather

If you're flying over table top
Eyes wide with wine and wonder
Or lazy counting kangaroos
In the dingle days down under

Down under, down under
In dingle days down under
Over the next hill
There's no more rain or thunder

Though you chose the open road when you were willing
To sing and dance and take the tambourine and the shilling
All the secret tricks and footsteps you were learning
But once the stone begins to roll, it's not the turning

Like a rolling stone
With no direction home

Though you chose the open road when you were willing
To sing and dance and take the tambourine and the shilling
All the secret tricks and footsteps you were learning
But once the stone begins to roll, it's not the turning

Like a rolling stone
With no direction home

If you're pacing in the dressing room
Where there's no fresh paint or windows
Or you're strutting on some dusty stage
And wondering where the time goes

The time goes, the time goes
Wondering where the time goes
Over the next hill
They say there will be rainbows

Oh rainbows, rainbows
Somewhere over rainbows
Over the next hill
Who knows where the time goes
