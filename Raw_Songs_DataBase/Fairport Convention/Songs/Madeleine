She was standing there, at the country fair
Sun was on her hair, I could only stare
From the moment when I saw her dancing
Well, I knew she had to be my bride

It was summertime, I was feeling fine
Would she join the line? I took her hand in mine
From the moment when we danced together there
I knew she was to be my bride

We danced in the sun together
Danced in the rain together
Danced when the other folk had gone upon their way
She danced into my heart in such a pretty way
I knew she had to be my bride

While the music played, dancing through the day
We'd so much to say, time just slipped away
From the moment when I saw her dancing
Well, I knew she had to be my bride

She made my courage free, I sat her on my knee
Made a lover's plea, would she marry me?
From the moment when we danced together then
I knew she had to be my bride

We danced in the sun together
Danced in the rain together
Danced when the other folk had gone upon their way
She danced into my heart in such a pretty way
I knew she had to be my bride

Madeleine, the fairest girl I've ever seen
Madeleine, you know what you mean to me

When she danced with me, I was full of glee
We could happily, as a family
From the moment when I saw her dancing
Then I knew she was to be my bride

Came the wedding day, people bright and gay
Music gently played, as our vows we made
From the moment when we danced together then
I knew she had to be my bride

We danced in the sun together
Danced in the rain together
Danced when the other folk had gone upon their way
She danced into my heart in such a pretty way
I knew she had to be my bride

Madeleine, the fairest girl I've ever seen
Madeleine, you know what you mean to me

She was standing there, at the country fair
Sun was on her hair, I could only stare
From the moment when I saw her dancing
Well, I knew she was to be my bride

We danced in the sun together
Danced in the rain together
Danced when the other folk had gone upon their way
She danced into my heart in such a pretty way
I knew she had to be my bride

Madeleine, the fairest girl I've ever seen
Madeleine, you know what you mean to me
