There's a time I remember
When I tired to be free
I fought like a lion
But I couldn't see
That I was a loser
Before I fired the very first shot
And a back row seat in life
Was all I got

It was all right protesting
I could see it wearing thin
So I walk along the back roads
Waiting for the tide to come in

So the baliff makes you
A traveling man
You swap your house
For a Bedford Van
The countryside I closed
The law wont let you move
They'll push you through the country
What are they tryin' to prove

When you've no harm
Committed no big sin
Just get out along the back roads
And wait for the tide to come in

Hold on
Do you believe the politicians?
Hold on
Do you really think they'll listen
Hold on
Fighting to see it through

Hold back
Before you make a big decision
Hold back
They'll strain to see your vision
Hold back
Don't believe what you read in the news

As you grow older
You gotta realize
You've gotta bend a little
You've got to compromise
And get out on the back roads
Stay off the highway line
Ooh stay while no lies
You will see it come in time

They can't keep you down forever
Their wedge is wearing thin
So get out on the back roads
And wait for the tide to come in

There was a time I remember
When I tried to be free
I fought like a lion
But I couldn't see
That I was a loser
Before I fired the very first shot
And a back row seat in life
Was all I got

It was all right protecting
I could see it wearing thin
So I walk along the back roads
And wait for the tide to come in

Yeah I walk along the backroads
And wait for the tide to come in
