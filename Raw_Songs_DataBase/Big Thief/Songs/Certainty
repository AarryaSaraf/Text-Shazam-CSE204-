Name on the line
Last request
Pull the car over
To find some rest
Saying "I love you"
Need to lie here
Need to leave
Living in the debt of make believe
Saying I owe you
Crooked as a crow gnawing on dawn
Shadow from the grass in the dirt on the lawn
Why do I string you along?

My certainty is wild, weaving
For you I am a child, believing
You lay beside me sleeping on a plain 
In the future

Sit on the phone
Watch TV
Romance, action, mystery
Wanted to show you
Sine wave is a particle ride
Bring your light out then in on the tide
Maybe I love you
Maybe I love you is a river so high
Maybe I love you is a river so low
I love you, still don't know

My certainty is wild, weaving
For you I am a child, believing
You lay beside me sleeping on a plane
In the future

My certainty is wild, weaving
For you
I am a child, believing
You lay beside me sleeping on a plain
In the future
