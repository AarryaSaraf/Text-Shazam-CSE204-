What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take
To free the celestial body?

From way up there it looks so small
From way down here it looks so small
One peculiar organism aren't we all together?
Everybody steps on ants
Everybody eats the plants
Everybody knows to dance even with just one finger

What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take
To free the celestial body?

When I took another look
The past was not a history book
That was just some linear perception
Ash to ask and dust to dusk
A dime a dozen aren't we just?
But a dozen dimes will buy a crust of garlic bread

What's it gonna take
What's it gonna take
What's it gonna take?
To free the celestial body

When I say celestial
I mean extra-terrestrial
I mean accepting the alien you've rejected in your own heart
When I say heart, I mean finish
The last one there is a potato kinish
Baking too long in the sun of Spud Infinity
When I say infinity I mean now
Kiss the one you are right now
Kiss your body up and down, other than your elbows
'Cause as for your elbows they're on their own
Wandering like a rolling stone
Rubbing up against the edges of experience

What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take
To free the celestial body?

Woo
