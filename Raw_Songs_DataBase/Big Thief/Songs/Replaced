Goin' to Santa Fe
And make a new beginning
What's that you were starting to say?
Or have you forgotten?

'Cause, 'cause the unlit moon is rather high
We are cleansed by the mystery of the stars
'Cause in your room forgotten
To be replaced by the mystery of the heart

Pull on your new blue coat
Try to remember the words you once wrote
The canyons that catch in your throat
The faultlines that carry the green of the river

'Cause, 'cause the unlit moon is rather high
We are cleansed by the mystery of the stars
'Cause in your room forgotten
To be replaced by the mystery of the heart

Go on, now

'Cause, 'cause the unlit moon is rather high
Be replaced by the mystery of the stars
Because in your room forgotten
To be replaced by the mystery of the heart
To be replaced by the mystery
