Wrapped in the wings of a sparrow
Beak is as sharp as an arrow
Sings in a whispering whistle
Sleeps in the ivy and thistle
Owls out swooping and howling
Deep in the midnight a' prowling
Mama the scream of the eagle
Threading my heart through the needle
Threading the blood through the apple
Sucking the juice from the apple
Eating the seeds of the apple
Bearing the tree of the apple
Trapped in the weeds like a scarecrow
Stuck to the wind like Velcro
Distantly hearing the bell toll
Warbling chime through the meadow
Mama the scream of the eagle
Threading my heart through the needle
Threading the blood through the apple
Eve sucked the juice from the apple
Nakedly running I saw her
Boy chasing after to stall her
I wish I'd have spoken to call her
Before she found fabric to shawl her
Breasts bound and burdened with fiber
Adam came trembling beside her
And he said, he said
"She has the poison inside her
She talks to snakes and they guide her
She has the poison inside her
She talks to snakes and they guide her
She has the poison inside her
She talks to snakes and they guide her"
She has the poison inside her
She talks to snakes and they guide her
