I already died
I'm singing from the other side
Underneath love
Avoidance and pride
I look you in the face and lie
I tell you I want your love
You're the cigarette in my fist
You are so hard to resist
I can't help but breathe your love
When I'm scared to die alone
That's when I call you on the phone
I tell you that I need your love

Oh, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love

Oh, frailty and fragile words
You tell me a lot of words
You tell me all about your love
And I feel what I hear you say
I don't talk the same way
'Cause that don't feel like love

As the dog opens his eyes
As the blue crow flies, I'm going to meet my love
I already died
I'm calling from the other side
Underneath love
There's a bottle out in the sea
With a message inside from me
Saying, "Release my love"

Release my love, my love
I'm dreaming of release, my love
Release my love, my love
Release my love
Release, my love

Well, it's a moving operation
I'm getting off at this station
I'm leaving your love
I'm scared to die alone
I call you on the phone
Watch me bleed your love

Oh, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love

Release my love, my love
Release my love, my love
Release my love, my love
Release my love, my love
Release my love, my love
Release my love
