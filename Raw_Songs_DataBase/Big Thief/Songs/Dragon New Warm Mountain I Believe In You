It's a little bit magic
Like a river of morning geese
In the new warm mountain
Where the storm face forms and speaks
I believe in you
Even when you need to
Recoil

When the topsoil
Is kicking up into the storm
Where the dust goes dancing
And a billion planets are born
I believe in you
Even when you need to
Recoil

Just like that
The moon goes flat
Big lights in the city shine
Crying out
Take me to the limits of your love

There's a dragon in the phone line
Coughing up a mighty flame
With a tongue of silver
Calling on my oldest name
She says, "Hey you
Do you remember me too?"
We were coiling

It's a little bit magic
Magic
A little bit magic
Magic
