Blue lightning was an autograph
Signin' up the sky
To the question I had to ask
She only answered, "Why?"
Angelia took a photograph
The moment had to die
Years later, like an epitaph
We read it and we cry
This mornin' I went to have a bath
The water ran dry
Clear warnin', has it come at last?
The time to say goodbye
Can we make love, can we hold fast?

Two-eyed lie
Is it fight or fly?

Till the end, will you be my friend?

You circle and dive
Blue angel, yeah, you're in my dreams

And a spider just beside her, larger than a hill
And it's plain to see if she don't comfort me
The rattlesnake will

Two-eyed lie
Is it fight or fly?
I wanna be the wrinkle in your eye
Till the end, will you be my friend?
I wanna be the shoelace that you tie
Yeah, I wanna be the vapor gets you high

Two-eyed lie
Is it fight or fly?
I wanna be the shoelace that you tie
Till the end, will you be my friend?
I wanna be the mountain, kiss the sky
Yeah, I wanna be the vapor gets you high
Yeah, I wanna feel so happy that I cry
Yeah, I wanna be the shoelace that you tie
Yeah, I wanna live forever till I die
Yeah, I wanna live forever till I die
Yeah, I
