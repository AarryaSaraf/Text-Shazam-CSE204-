You somehow let me down
Both hands and a gentleman
You could not take me through
New plans, tell me who
New friends, I can make some too
I know

You somehow took me in
Both arms, the marked-up skin
Two hands, places you have been
That I needed

And the more that we try
To figure through the answers
To repeat ourselves
To deny, deny

Now you call my bluff
All clear, and you get so rough
Stone-faced in the light
The air and the jagged bite
Cold air, the wisdom of the night
Between us

And the more that we try
To figure through the answers
To repeat ourselves
To deny, deny
To deny, deny, deny

Somehow we exist
In the folds and now we'll kiss
Both hands, the mystery before us
She's reaching

But I could not take you through
New plans, I'll tell you who
New friends, you can make some too
I know
