I am the magazine
The blue screen
The big hand moving past the last thing
I turn for you, turn for you
Turn for you, turn for you

I am the private room
The quiet croon
The grey eye blinking on the new moon
I burn for you, burn for you
Burn for you, burn for you

Within the last kiss
I am the genesis
While the earth rolls bleeding from its axis
Return to you, turn to you
Turn to you, turn to you

I am the water rise
The waterfall
Filling up your eyes and when you give the call
I run for you, run for you
Run for you, run for you
Run for you, run for you
Run for you

I am the sweaty sheets
The wet bed
The things she'll do and the things she said
I'll come for you, come for you
Come for you, come for you

I am the right brain
The paper crane
The bright gold moving past the night train
A blurred view, blurred view
Blurred view, blurred view

I am the new disease
I am the new disease
The light breeze
The yellow stars glowing through the white trees
I pine for you, pine for you
Shine for you, pine for you

I am the teeth sharp
The lips read
What is unfeared and what is unfed
I'll feed for you, feed for you
Feed for you, feed for you

One step closer and I'm real
Tell me everything you feel
And I will sing for you, sing for you
Sing for you, sing for you
Sing for you

One step closer and I'm real
Tell me everything you feel
One step closer and I'm real
Tell me everything you feel
And I will sing for you, sing for you
Sing for you, sing for you
Sing for you
