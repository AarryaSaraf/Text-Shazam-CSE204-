Exit on a whim
Hopefully we find it again
Tired of turning back
Let's keep on moving down the track
And if the horse lies down
There's a push just a mile uptown
If the horse lies down

Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride

Hand upon my skin
Warm me up and calm me down
I like to watch your chin
Tracing the familiar sound
Of the famous song
Put one on let's sing along
To the famous song

Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride

Vacancy is none
The same idea from everyone
We never plan ahead
We take the gamble on instead
And if they turn us down
Find a warm bed in the next town
If they turn us down

Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss the ride
