We served his body
Naked in bed
Quiet and obviously not dead

I and that naked thing swimming in air
Why does that mean anything?
Why do you stare?

Lean on your table
Ask what you want of me
I am unable
Cry with me, cry with me

Within this body
Come home and fuse
Come fuse my home for a refuge
I don't wanna be scared of (I don't wanna be scared of)
Anybody coming in (Anybody coming in)
I don't wanna lock my door anymore

Hand me that cable
Plug into anything
I am unstable
Rock and sing, rock and sing
