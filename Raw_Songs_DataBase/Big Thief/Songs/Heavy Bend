Came to light on a very hot day
The grass was sweating
You were sleeping in
With the window open
The blanket breathing
Cigarette on a golden ash tray
Your golden hair lay
In the swollen sunray
The withered roses hangin' in the doorway

Don't wanna be right
Don't wanna be let down
Don't wanna fight
Don't wanna pretend
Formless secret
Heavy bend
Heavy bend

Second sight and the clouds above you
As the wilderness grew thicker and the crow flew
Tossing and turning, your forehead burning

Don't wanna be right
Don't wanna be let down
Don't wanna fight
Don't wanna defend
Formless secret
Heavy bend

From the empty height
Flies on the ceiling now
Wanna hold you tight
Don't wanna pretend
Formless secret
Heavy bend
Heavy bend
Heavy bend
