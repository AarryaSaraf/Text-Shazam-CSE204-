Jodi
Please turn the pages for me
You seem so free
You know I'm barely
Barely

Wrap me in silk
I want to drink your milk
You hold the key
You know I'm barely
Barely

Parker Lake Beach
All of the sunnys swimming
I wanna see
To feel my body sinking
Sinking

She gives me gills
Helps me forgive the pills
She makes me sing
She is both dreamer
And dream
And dream
And dream
And dream
