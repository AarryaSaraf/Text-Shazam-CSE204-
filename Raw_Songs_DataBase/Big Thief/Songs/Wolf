Here to the mornin' noon
Woke up as you left the room
Pillow still warm
Scent like meadow grass

Has the feelin' come to pass?
Has the feelin' come to stay?
What can we say?
Wishin' you'd hang around

Livin' on the waterfront
Witnessing the gameless hunt
Mermaids don't kill
That's the way they seem, so fine

Now your lips are on the line
Now there is a broken tongue
Neck is so young
Felt so frozen

Have you seemed to follow through
On everything you yearned for?
Steps so fair
So much certainty

Now, as far as we can see
The water's getting deeper
My safe-keeper
The wolf is howling for me

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

When she holds me in her jaw
All the blood dripping
Will I be free
To cease gripping?

Find me lyin' on the ground
Open hands empty
I'll return back again
If you let me

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
