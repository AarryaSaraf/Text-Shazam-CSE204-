The animals are wonderful
Such a vision in the sun, how they rail
I catch my breath and count my dough
And I only live to run and I'll need to go
You and I were born and I'll make you make your mind up
Hold me

She always knew
She'll always know
That I love to run so well but I need to go
You and I were born and I'll make you make your mind up
Hold me

You and I were born with the same design
Nothing in the world that will make you make your mind up
If I had a choice I'll wait to find
Nothing in your eyes will tell me where you'll lie
Hold me
