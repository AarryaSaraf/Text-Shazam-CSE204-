Please cut my hair
Take me to the kitchen
What are the chances?
You have the scissors
Maybe a pair
It's longer than I can even bear

You wanna be alone
Use your ammunition
To empty your arms
You ask me
To leave you
I won't

Not well when life it at your throat
Any, reminds me
The diamond mens are burning
I push her around
But she keeps returning

Teeth, drool and beard
Make a clean incision
Hold me for ransom
Tell me I'm pretty
Tell me I'm rare

Talk to the boy in me, he's there
And we do sit though
Swaying in the kitchen
Rocking slowly

Tell him
To sound the
Alarm

Is he gonna keep me safe from harm?
Any, reminds me
The diamond mens are burning
I push her around
But she keeps returning
