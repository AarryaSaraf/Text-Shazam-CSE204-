Album: SmallTalk

// Small Talk //

It's the way you sound
The reason that you know yeah
It's the way you get down
I can tell you really are it

Small talk how you doing there
Small talk how you doing boy
Small talk whatcha doing there
Oooh, small talk uh-huh

Small talk, small talk
Small talk, small talk

Get on down small talk
I like you small talk
Uh-uh-ooh small talk

Don't let him cry
Don't let him cry
Small talk
Don't let them cry
Don't you let any body cry small talk

Don't let them cry
Don't you let that big boy cry small talk

// Say You Will //

Give a damn, you all ooh-ee
Oh, give a damn, you all
(Y'all)
Ooh, we're not teasin' you, it would be in vain
If I'm free to see away from you it's strange
Say you will, say you will, say you will, you will

When you get up, get down, something bad for you
Oh, your luck has found, oh ah, me and you
Say you will, say you will, say we will, I will

A whole lotta nothin' and a way to go
Jimmy cotton corn and a little bit of something
About a day too old
A hippopotamus is way too fat for me
Hip about us some of us gonna get bound
And get down but don't be free get down y'all

Say we will, say we will, say we will, I will
If the way you die makes life worth livin'
Be true what'll I say, thanks for the thing you're givin' me
Say you will, say you will, say we will, I will

A wooden nickel won't pay my bill
A chip on the shoulder not good for shit
A leaky bottom won't last too long
A freaky rival, never sing my freaky song

Give a damn y'all
Say you will, say you will, say you will, I will
Give a damn y'all

// Mother Beautiful //

Who's the one who finally takes the pain
With you, with you
Suffers even when it's you to blame
With you, with you

Mother beautiful, you're just beautiful
Mother beautiful, can never behold

Who's the reason for my daddy's grin
It's true
It's true
Every season and she's my best friend
It's true
It's true

Mother beautiful, you're just beautiful
Mother beautiful, can never behold

Sometimes I say mama (Mother beautiful)
If I'm a here (Mother beautiful)
Sometimes I call my mama
Yeah, she's here

// Time For Livin' //

Time for livin', time for givin'
No time for makin' up a monster to share
Time for livin', time for givin'
No time for breakin' our own fairy tale

Ain't, ain't, ain't nobody's got to spell it for me
Ain't nobody got it yet I can see
Ain't nobody got the thing I can hear
But if I have to I will yell in your ear

Time for livin', time for givin'
No time for runnin' over anyone
Let's share time for livin', time for givin'
No time for passin', done the fun

Ain't nobody's got to spell it for me
Ain't nobody got it yet I can see
Ain't nobody got the thing I can hear
Don't you, don't you, don't you, yell in my ear

Time for changin', re-arrangin'
No time for peace, just pass the buck
Rearrangin', leader's changin'
Pretty soon he might not give a damn

Ain't nobody's got to spell it for me
Ain't nobody got it yet I can see
Ain't nobody got the thing I can hear
But if I have to I will yell in your ear

Time's a changin', rearrangin'
Time's a changin', rearrangin'
Time's a changin', rearrangin'
Time's a changin', rearrangin'
Time rearrangin', time rearrangin'

Time's a changin', rearrangin'
Time's a changin', rearrangin'
Time's a changin', rearrangin'

// Can't Strain My Brain //

I can't strain my brain
I know how it feels to worry all the time
I can't take the pain
I know how it feels to worry over, just a dime

Yes, I guess it was me, for us to guess
That we're gonna have to be free
Keep on runnin', when you feel her
Pullin' back you're goin' strong
Don't stop runnin' if you're real
You'll never slack, you got to go on

Yes, I guess it was me, for us to guess
That we're gonna have to be free

Can't strain my brain
When I feel somebody tryin' to bring me down
Won't take the rain
Don't you know you'll never catch me lyin' down

Can't bust a man
If he feels he makes it easier to see
Can't trust a man
And trust can take the lovin' out of me yeah

Yes pleasure was made, for us to see
Guess, that were just gonna have to be free

Can't strain my brain
Can't take the rain
Damn this pain
You don't remain

// Better Thee Than Me //

Better thee than me, if you in that weather
Better thee than me, if you are heavy feather
Would you try to share a funny religion
Would you have to bear a dummy's decision

Better thee than me, I'm strokin' and hopin'
Better thee than me, I'm strokin' and hopin'
Better thee than me 'cause you're jokin'
What you sayin'

Better thee than me, help me there, I can make it
Let me be, better let me be while you fake it
Stop your pout, stop your pout, let me step and work it out
Every thing's gonna drop, you better change your route
Till the sail is jerkin'

Yeah, I would try to stay, but you're drivin'
Love yourself, love you babe
Better thee than me if you won't respect me

// Livin' While I'm Livin' //

Remember the day, remember the way
That we were partners, what you say, hey, hey
Remember the songs, what's all you done with me
Remember we'd done, with the violence oh well
To get what you made, to get you a date
Without your feedback a trippin'
Get the thing straight, someone'd play
If you're sleepin' stepin' back in

Livin' while I'm livin'
Livin' while I'm livin'
Livin' while I'm livin'
Livin' while I'm livin'

Standin' around, standin' look out
While I shivered, don't you say that
Me with the mouth, tellin' the south
I wouldn't, oh wowow
Takin' the town, takin' the gun and the winner
Makin' your mind, makin' my find, a beginner

Livin' while I'm livin'
Livin' while I'm livin'
Livin' while I'm livin'
Livin' while I'm livin'

Show me the brain, that wanted to train
You to make it
Trouble to me, you needed to see
You shake it

Say it brother
Livin' while I'm livin'

// This Is Love //

Wh oh, turn the strings on, do, do, do

Ceranne, I might as well admit
Ceranne, I gotta tell you quick

Shuwa, doo wop
Shuwa, doo wop
Shuwa, doo wop

Ceranne, I feel that we're together
Ceranne, I've got to do it, I'd rather
Ceranne, I'm not a man for nothing
