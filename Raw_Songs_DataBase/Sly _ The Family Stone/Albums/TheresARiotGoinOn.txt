// Luv N' Haight //

Feel so good inside myself Don't want to move 
Feel so good inside myself Don't need to move.
As I grow up I'm growing down. And when I'm lost, 
I know I will be found.
Feel so good Don't want to move. 
Feel so good inside myself. Don't need to move.
I
Feel so good inside myself, Don't want to move.
I
Feel so good inside myself, Don't want to move.
Another place, another time And when I realize
I'm still all mine...
I
I
Yeh I
I feel,
I feel so good
Want to move. Want to move. Feel so good. Want to move. 
Feel so good. Want to move.
Feel so good inside myself Don't want to move.
Feel so good inside myself, Don't need to move.
Don't want to move Feel so good inside myself. Don't want to move.
Feel so good. Feel so good Don't want to move.
Feel so good inside myself, Don't need to move.
Want to move. Feel so good, can not move. Feel so good, can not move.
Don't need to move. I feel so good Don't need to move. 
Don't need to move. Don't want to move.
Feel so good. Feel so good. I want to move. I want to move.
Feel so good. Feel so good. I want to move. I want to move. 
Feel so good. Feel so good. I want to move. I want to move. 
Feel so good. Feel so good. I want to move. I want to move. 
Feel so good. Feel so good. I want to move. I want to move. 
Feel so good. Feel so good. I want to move. I want to move. 
Feel so good. I want to move. I want to move.

// Just Like A Baby //

Just like a baby, 
Sometimes I cry.
Just like a baby, 
I can feel it when 
You lie to me.
Just like a baby 
I'll try if I can
Just like a baby,
Just like a baby 
Inside a little big man
Everything is new.
Just like a baby,
Come to find out
I'm a whole lot like
You, too
Just like a baby
See the thing it's growin',
Just like a baby
Blowin'.

// Poet //

My only weapon is my pen
And the frame of mind I'm in.
I'm a songwriter, A poet.
I'm a songwriter, A poet.
And the things I flash on Everyday
They all reflect In what I say.
I'm a songwriter I'm a poet
I'm a songwriter, Oh yeh a poet.

// Family Affair //

It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair

One child grows up to be
Somebody that just loves to learn
And another child grows up to be
Somebody you'd just love to burn

Mom loves the both of them
You see, it's in the blood
Both kids are good to mom
Blood's thicker than the mud

It's a family affair
(It's a family affair)
It's a family affair
(It's a family affair)
Over there, over there

Newlywed a year ago
But you're still checking each other out, hey
Nobody wants to blow
Nobody wants to be left out, uh-huh

You can't leave 'cause your heart is there
But, sure, you can't stay 'cause you been somewhere else
You can't cry 'cause you'll look broke down
But you're cryin' anyway 'cause you're all broke down

It's a family affair
(It's a family affair)
It's a family affair
(It's a family affair)
Oh, hey, a family affair
(It's a family affair)
Ow
(It's a family affair)

(It's a family affair)
Oh
(It's a family affair)
(It's a family affair)
It's a family affair
(It's a family affair)
Well
Do-do-do-do
Hey-hey-hey
(It's a family affair)
(It's a family affair)

// Africa Talks To You "The Asphalt Jungle" //

to see a lazy.
A brain he meant to be. Cop out?
He's crazy!

And who's believing who? Who's doin' the fishin'?
Do what you want to do or you can keep on wishin'!

Timber... all fall down!
Timber... who's around!
Watch out, 'cause the summer gets cold...
When today gets too old!

Must be a rush for you to see a lazy.
In his back yard he grew Cop out.
He's crazy!

When life means much to you,
Why live for dying?
If you are doing right,
Why are you crying?

Timber... all fall down!
Timber... who's around!
Watch out, 'cause the summer gets cold...
When today gets too old.

// Brave And Strong //

Frightened faces to the wall
Oh can't you hear your
Mama call?

The Brave and Strong Survive!

When you walk,
Know where you're walking.
When you talk
Know who you're talking to.

Brave and Strong Survive! Survive!

Out and Down
Ain't got a friend.
You don't know who turned You in.
The Brave and Strong, Survive!

Brave and Strong,
Survive!

Before me was a Cowboy star.
Indians!
And there you are.

The Brave and Strong, Survive!

The Brave and Strong, Survive Child!

Yeh Jones, Survive

// (You Caught Me) Smilin' //

You caught me smilin' again.
You caught me smilin' again.
Hangin' loose
'Cause you ain't used to seeing me turnin' on.

You caught me smilin' again.
You caught me smilin' again.
I'll be gone
And it won't take you long to climb a tree about me.

You caught me smilin' again.
You caught me smilin' again.

I'll be around to carry on!

Hey, you caught me smilin' again.
You caught me smilin' again.
In my pain I'll be sane to take your hand.

// Time //

TIME.
Needs another minute
(At least).

Take your TIME.
But you've got a limit.

That girl looks forward To another meetin'.
Just like everydaypeoplelknow
Look forward to another simple greetin'.
TIME.
A bear in the woods looks
Forward to hibernatin'.
Just any ol' player you know
All he needs is a ratin'.

TIME is education,
Even when they tell you
It's sophistication.

You know that TIME
Needs to be a little longer.
Oh TIME!

The universe needs to be a little stronger.

TIME they say is
The answer

But I don't believe it
TIME

// Spaced Cowboy //

I can't say it more than once
'Cause I'm thinking twice as fast.
Yodel-ayde-a.

Everything I like is nice
That's why I try to have it twice.
Yodel-ayde-a [etc.]

Well once I saw a bore,
Who was a social whore.
Yodel-ayde-a.

And they said I had a limp
And then they tried to pass around I was a pimp.
Yodel-ayde-a [etc.]

Was on my last leg.
I couldn't even borrow my friend's extra peg at all.
Yodel-ayde-a.

Once I turned red
And it loohed funny in the head.
Yodel-ayde-a [etc.]

// Runnin' Away //

Running away to get away
Ha ha ha ha
You're wearing out your shoes

Look at you, fooling you

Making blues of night and day
Hee hee hee hee
You're stretching out your dues

Look at you, fooling you

Shorter cut is quicker but
Ha ha ha ha
Time is here to stay

Look at you, fooling you

The deeper in debt the harder you bet
Hee hee hee hee
Need more room to play

Look at you, fooling you

Another day you're farther away
Ha ha ha ha
A longer trip back home

// Thank You For Talkin' To Me Africa //

Lookin' at the devil, Grinnin' at his gun.
Fingers start shakin', I begin to run.

Bullets start chasin' I begin to stop. 
We begin to wrestle I was on the top.

Sellin' out is harder.
