// In Time //

There's a mickie in the tasting of disaster
In time	in time you get faster
Harry Hippie is a waste as if he hasta 
procrastanatin'
Something moving in the brain of a doer
In time	in time feel a little newer
I switched from coke to pep and I'm a connoisseur
'Bout time
'Cause there's a method in the madness of the thinking
In time oh we oughta
It seems the best of all the sadness is is a sinkin'
In time	in time muddy water
And there's a wreck yard in the mind of a quitter
In time	in time gonna git bitter
He don't give a heck or is he blind and makin' litter
In time	
'bout time gonna need a babysitter
I felt so good I told the leader how to follow
In time	in time git down
So glad I could not feel indeed so very hollow
No need to follow
Insecurities attracting every flirter
In time in time it's murder
If you don't mind please why give slack to a deserter
In time

Well well oh well day light is all I see
stay light and wait for me
See you tomorrow noon miss me
I'll see you soon

I told you it's not the teachin' it's the learning
In time	in time don't need no burning
When I mold you to start reaching in the mernin
In time
Well well there's a feeling oh so real in every human
On time	'bout time
There's a reeling when you don't know what you're doing
In time 'bout time

Haay stay around get a show in time
don't you know
Two years too long to wait
Two words will get it straight
In time
See an answer in time and that ain't nothing I'm a dancer
Two years too long to wait
Two words will get it straight

// If You Want Me To Stay //

If you want me to stay,
I'll be around today,
to be available for you to see.
But I am about to go,
And then you'll know,
For me to stay here I got to be me.

You'll never be in doubt,
That's what it's all about,
You can't take me for granted and smile.
Count the days I'm gone
Forget reachin' me by phone
Because I promise I'll be gone for a while.

And when you see me again,
I hope that you have been,
The kind of person....that you really are now.
Got to get in straight,
How could I ever be late,
When you're my woman taking up my time.

Whoa, oh how could I ever allow,
I guess I wonder how,
I could get out a pocket for fun. HOW HOW!!
When you know that you're never number two,
Number one's gonna be number one,
ohh oww oohh

I'll be good,
I wish I could
I get this message over to you now.
ahhh, yeah, message, mmmm
When you see me again,
I hope that you have been,
The kind of person you really are now.
I'll be so good, oh
I wish I could,
I get this message over to you now.

ahhh, yeah.....

// Let Me Have It All //

You have turned into a prayer
I can feel I'm almost there
Closer closer to the top
Looking down is quite a drop
Let me have it all
Let me have it all
Let me have it all
Let me have it all

You set up a barrier
Don't you know I'd marry ya
Can't explain how you make me feel
Don't you know I'm feeling real
Make me feel like a kang
Everythang is everythang

Let me have it all
Let me have it all
Let me have it all
Let me have it all

You've turned into a prayer
I can feel you almost there
Closer closer to the top
Looking down is quite a drop
Just to be near you is to be
Let me have the rest of me
You set up a barrier
Don't you know I'd marry ya
Can't explain how you make me feel
Don't you know I'm feeling real

// Frisky //

I'll be down, when you're gone
Call me back on the telephone
Lil ole, lil ole, lil ole name and a title
I gets all the way down
If I don't keep smilin' witchall
You gonna see me frown
That's why I keep music
All around the bed
So I can call Frisky
Very hard to be led in the wrong direction
Frisky, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh Frisky, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh Frisky, yeah, yeah, Frisky, hah hah
Put a little tickle on the Jones' head
Turn off the lights and go to bed
Have you ever ever stopped a rainbow
I don't think so at least
It kept on comin'
What an afternoon feast
Energy the jailur
Wanna keep it in check
Gonna check with my tailor
'Cause I don't give a heck
Yeah, yeah, Frisky, Frisky yeah
Ah huh Frisky, oh yes sir Frisky

Put a little tickle on the Jones' head
Turn off the lights and go to bed
Under-under-understand the
power of a little heart
Applied at the wrong pressure
Makes for a slower start yea

Short time I'll be there
Didn't wait too long
I long for sunday
When I don't feel strong
Get down somethin' Frisky

// Thankful N' Thoughtful //

Sunday morning, I forgot my prayer
I should have been happy, I still be there
Something could have come and taken me away
But the mainman felt Sly should be here another day

That's why I got to be thankful yeah, yeah
I gotta be thoughtful
Ah ha thankful, you gotta be
thoughtful

From my ankle to the top of my head
I've taken my chances hah, I could have been dead
I started climbing from the bottom oh yeah
All the way to the top ah huh
Before I knew it-I was up there
You believe it or not

Thankful thoughtful

Oh something gets me, hah, put my head on tight
Because I know the future everything'll be all right
Until then I'll kick back and let the light shine
Remember all yours coulda been all mine

That's why you ought to be thankful
Hah, hah, you ought to be thoughtful

Middle of stream, hah, I had to change my stroke
I say I put it on the good foot And it ain't no joke
They said I was dyin' I didn't want to go
I kept on feelin' I had to live some more

I had somethin' to tell y'all
To be thankful you oughta be thoughtful

Still rectifying, straightening things out
I know what a good feelin' you're never in doubt
Sometimes I'm by myself- feelin' alone
I just look around and check it out And then it's all gone

I'm still happy to be here
Thankful you oughta be thoughtful
Count your blessings

My Momma gave me a song And said Son sang
Record thankful and thoughtful, be such a nice thang
People got to be reminded where it's really at
Make your Daddy happy Momma likes it like that

You know I know you know I know
I'm thankful you know I'm thoughtful

// Skin I'm In //

Oooth hooo-if I could do it all over again
Oooth hoo hoo-I'd be in the same skin I'm in
The clothes I wear and the things they dare me to do

Oooh hoooo hoo-the places I go
Ohooo hout and the people I know
The things I gain oooh Sometime they rain on me
Hay aaeee skin I'm in
Hay-a and the things I never never win

// I Don't Know (Satisfaction) //

People to see, even me
Man with a little got more of a plea
He's cryin'-I don't know

Time at last, laws to pass
Can't be a few got to be a mass
A-tryin'-got to go

Bigger crowd, feelin' proud
And all of a sudden I'm singin' loud
Applyin'-what I know

Feel the game, not a pain
Ain't nobody in a strain
Defyin'-'cause they know

Now I know what to do
No more sellin' me to you
Buyin'-that's a no no no

Mother wit is what you git
Tryin' to have the most of it
Am I livin'-I don't know

Ask yourself how you feel
Are you really feelin' real
What you say-I don't know

I see abuse, what's the use
Time must let my people loose
We tryin'-I don't know

Much to learn, a place to turn
When there's nothin' else to burn
Replyin'-think I know

Nothin' in the way, but another day
And we're gonna push it on out the way
'Cause we're goin'-what we know

// Keep On Dancin' //

Dance to the music

// Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be) //

When I was just a little girl
I asked my Mother, "What will I be?
Will I be pretty? Will I be rich?"
Here's what she said to me:

"Oue sera sera, Whatever will be, will be.
The future's not ours to see.
Que sera, sera, What will be, will be."

When I grew up and fell in love
I asked my lover, "What will I be?
Will I have rainbows Day after day"
Here's what my lover said:

"Que sera, sera, Whatever will be, will be.
The future's not ours to see.
Que sera, sera, What will be, will be."

Now I have children of my own,
They ask their Mother, "What will I be?
Will I be handsome? Will I be rich?"
I tell them tenderly:

"Que sera sera, Whatever will be, will be.
The future's not ours to see.
Que sera, sera, What will be, will be."

// If It Were Left Up To Me //

If it were left up to me
It would take more than a notion
If it were left up to me
We could put ideas in motion
Had it been left up to you
Would you try, would you try
If it were left up to me
I would try

If it were left up to me
We would live in a bubble
If it were left up to me or you
we would stay out of trouble
But it's the way that they do
Makes you cry, makes you cry
And still it's left up to you
Got to try

If it were left up to you
Would you sigh and forget it
And get some sleeping to see
If you live to regret it
Now that it's left up to me and you
Will you try, will you try
I promise from me to you I will try
I promise from me to you I will try
