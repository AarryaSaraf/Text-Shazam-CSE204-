// Dynamite! //

MISS CLEAN
She's so together and nice, yeah
MISS CLEAN
I got to see her twice
MISS CLEAN
I like the way she moves, uh-huh

When I was through
She turned on the light
Made my heart beat dynamite
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite

MISS CLEAN
Give that girl a hand, yeah
MISS CLEAN
She's got a beautiful tan
MISS CLEAN
Straight to my head, uh-huh 
MISS CLEAN
I remember what she said, listen
MISS CLEAN
Yeah, me and you
Yeah, I want you
MISS CLEAN
Yeah, me and you
Yeah, me and you
MISS CLEAN
You got me, girl you got me
When I was down,
She turned on the light
Made my heart beat dynamite
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, dynamite,
dynamite

Dance to the music
Dance to the music

// Chicken //

You're a chicken
Have you heard about me
Don't be a ...
I am here to set you free

Don't let a stranger sell you stories
Buyin' is cheap and so is lyin'
I've got a place already for you
The space between livin' and dyin'

You're a chicken
'Cause you've got a gutter mind
Don't be a ...
You can leave your fear behind

Can't you tell I'm in your corner
Don't you know I'll do it for you, you
We'd be too much together
And there is nothing we can't do, no no

Cock-a-doodle-doo to you
Cock-a-doodle-doo 

You're a chicken
Have you heard about me 	
Don't be a ...
I am here to set you free

You just think I'm scared to party 
Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't
Call me chicken ...
You can call me what you want, hey

You're a chicken
Cock-a-doodle-doo to you
You're a ...
Cock-a-doodle-doo to you
You're a chicken
Cock-a-doodle-doo to you

// Plastic Jim //

All the plastic people
What do they all come for?

Plastic Jim
All his thoughts have faded
He cannot be degraded
'Cause all his friends are jaded
Plastic Jim

Plastic Jim
For 13 years of school
Might have a swimming pool
He just cannot be cool
Plastic Jim

Plastic Jim
He can't control his mind
Twice a week he's kind
The rest of the time he's lyin'
Plastic Jim

All the plastic people
What do they all come for?

Plastic Jim
Will give you a conversation 
To avoid a situation
That needs contemplation
Plastic Jim

Plastic Jim
With the cellophane smile
Ain't never been a problem child
But he will be after a while
Plastic Jim

Plastic Jim
Will take a blind man's glasses
Will steal a dead man's ashes
When his ego crashes
Plastic Jim

All the plastic people
What do they all come for?

// Harmony //

You can be you let me be me
that's harmony
Simple as 1-2-3
Easy as a-b-c

Some people feel some life is dead
Better use your head
Work it out and you'll find
Surprised at what you'll find

Something settles in the brain
stop what you're doing and listen to me
Do you like me for who I am
Or who you want me to be

You can be you let me be me
that's harmony
Simple as 1-2-3
Easy as a-b-c

Some people feel some life is dead
Better use your head
Work it out and you'll find
Surprised at what you'll find

I have noticed more than twice
it's so easy to be nice
but if it's you to be clown
I would never put you down

Simple people start talkin
don't let the sparklings cross your map
Simple progress starts
Talkin people that walk in town

// Life //

[All:]
Life, Life
Past the clouds
You don't have to come down

Life, Life
Tell it like it is
You don't have to die before you live

[Larry:]
You might get angry some times
But don't let it turn you around
All you gotta do
Is get your livin' down

Life, Life
Tell it like it is
You don't have to die before you live

[Sly:]
You might be scared of somethin' - look at Mr. Stewart!
He's the only person he has to fear
He'd only let himself get near
He don't trust nobody
If he stopped bein' so shady
He could have a nice young lady

Life, Life
Tell it like it is
You don't have to die before you live

[Freddie:]
You're gonna be sad sometime
You might wake up to find your pet is gone
But maybe
He's tired of bein' alone
Dog gets hip, it has to go 
If you're lovin' you can't be sad no more

Life, Life
Tell it like it is
You don't have to die before you live

Brothers and sisters holding hands
You sittin next to me

Peaceful minds and beautiful heads
You see short and long hair

// Jane Is A Groupee //

Jane is a Groupee, ahhh
Jane makes whoopee, ahhh
She's got a thing for the guys in the band
Every musician's biggest fan

She claps her hands without a doubt
Has no idea what the song's about
She's too busy tryin to figure out
the shorter route
to take the drummer home

Hey Larry, what's your space
Said you'd teach me how to play the bass
Since we got a little time to waste
We might as well get it on

Front row tickets for the very next show
Organ dreams, many friends to know
She's the only reason the horns will blow
Playin her favorite song

Jane, Jane, Shame Shame

Jane is a Groupee, ahhh
Jane makes whoopee, ahhh
She's got a thing for the guys in the band
Every musician's biggest fan

Hey Freddie I like you
When you play the blues you make me blue
I'd like to go around with you too

Ever see a Jane in action
Different levels of satisfaction
Cause her to lose a fraction
Of her womanhood

Hey Sly you can score with me
You can write your songs upon my knee
And when you get through you can be with me

Jane, Jane, Shame Shame
