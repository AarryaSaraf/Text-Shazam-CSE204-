Hey hey hey hey hey
I believe that I'm back
I believe I'm on the right track
Hey hey hey hey hey

I know the feelin' of bein' without
When deep within you're deep without
Only way to clear the doubt
Is turnin' all your insides out

Time in for gettin' back
I believe, I believe
(That) I'm on the right track
Time in Tor gettin' back
I believe. I believe
That I'm on the right track

Hey hey hey hey hey
I believe that I'm back
I believe I'm on the right track
Hey hey hey hey hey

Sometimes... that has caused so much
Is really not at all to touch
If what I see is right in front of me
There's no reason to need a crutch

Time in for gettin' back
I believe, I believe
(That) I'm on the right track
Time in Tor gettin' back
I believe. I believe
That I'm on the right track




Hey hey hey hey hey
I believe that I'm back
I believe I'm on the right track
Hey hey hey hey hey

Ain't it sweet when finding out
That deep within you're not without
When nothingness had...
I'm just turnin' my insides out

Time in for gettin' back
I believe, I believe
(That) I'm on the right track
Time in Tor gettin' back
I believe. I believe
That I'm on the right track

Time in for gettin' back
