You're good to me
Because you're people
You're good to me
Because you're people
So you see me and we party
And you know I party hearty
Should I offer a joint to you
You can say yes or no
Let me offer a point to you
You can slam my front door

I love you anyway
Cause you can be yourself today
You're good to me
Because you're people
Don't you feel a little stronger
Little more real a little more longer
Should I offer a drink to you
Just because your throat is dry
Let me offer a point to you
You should not wonder why

I love you anyway
You can be yourself today
You're good for me
I know it
I can't blow it
You're good to me
All you people in general
You're good to me
Because you're people
Chitter chatter going round
But I can't let it bring me down
You're good to me
Chitter chatter going round
But I can't let it bring me down
You're good to me
Chitter chatter going round
But I can't let it bring me down
You're good to me
