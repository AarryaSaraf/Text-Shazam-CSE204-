Better thee than me, if you in that weather
Better thee than me, if you are heavy feather
Would you try to share a funny religion
Would you have to bear a dummy's decision

Better thee than me, I'm strokin' and hopin'
Better thee than me, I'm strokin' and hopin'
Better thee than me 'cause you're jokin'
What you sayin'

Better thee than me, help me there, I can make it
Let me be, better let me be while you fake it
Stop your pout, stop your pout, let me step and work it out
Every thing's gonna drop, you better change your route
Till the sail is jerkin'

Yeah, I would try to stay, but you're drivin'
Love yourself, love you babe
Better thee than me if you won't respect me
