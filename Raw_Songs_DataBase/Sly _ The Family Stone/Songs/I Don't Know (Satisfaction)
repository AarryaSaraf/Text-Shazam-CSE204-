People to see, even me
Man with a little got more of a plea
He's cryin'-I don't know

Time at last, laws to pass
Can't be a few got to be a mass
A-tryin'-got to go

Bigger crowd, feelin' proud
And all of a sudden I'm singin' loud
Applyin'-what I know

Feel the game, not a pain
Ain't nobody in a strain
Defyin'-'cause they know

Now I know what to do
No more sellin' me to you
Buyin'-that's a no no no

Mother wit is what you git
Tryin' to have the most of it
Am I livin'-I don't know

Ask yourself how you feel
Are you really feelin' real
What you say-I don't know

I see abuse, what's the use
Time must let my people loose
We tryin'-I don't know

Much to learn, a place to turn
When there's nothin' else to burn
Replyin'-think I know

Nothin' in the way, but another day
And we're gonna push it on out the way
'Cause we're goin'-what we know
