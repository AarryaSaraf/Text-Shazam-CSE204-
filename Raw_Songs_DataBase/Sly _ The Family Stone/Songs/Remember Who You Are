When we know we are hearing
Everything we say
What they think they're feeling
Are the games they think we play
And if you're like nobody
Remember you're nobody else, too
Know you tried too hard to get along
Then you're only bein' yourself

Remember who you are
Remember, that's who you will be
Remember who you are
Remember, that's the person
Who's gonna be free

When things seem so hazy
And facts attempt to blind
The few that think it's crazy
Confused with peace of mind
They must know you're hearing
Everything they say
Giving you more of a reason
To keep on goin' your way

Remember who you are
Remember who you are
Remember who you are
Remember who you are

Flirtin' with what you shouldn't
Very little chance to grow
Hurtin' when you know you wouldn't
No win, no place, no show
Somebody else's medicine
Could be a poison to you
But you can always bet it some
'Cause when yon play yon play

Remember who you are
Remember who you are
Remember who you are
Remember who you are
