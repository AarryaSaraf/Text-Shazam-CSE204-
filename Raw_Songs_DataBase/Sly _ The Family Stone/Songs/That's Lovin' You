I love you
You know it
How do you feel
I finally got you
Can't blow it
You know it's real for Syl
Finally planned it
Can you stand it
How did you know yeah
I demand it
Can you stand it
This time for sure

You know that's lovin' you
All my dreams cost and
I do too
You know that's lovin' you
And none of my dreams are lost
And I'm with you

I'm seeing me
I'm being me
so outasite
I'm freein' me
Yeah you and me
Turn out the lights

I love you
You know it
How do you feel well
I finally got you
Can't blow it
This time for real for Syl

You know that's lovin' you
All my dreams cost and
I do too
You know that's lovin' you
None of my dreams are lost
You see I'm with you
All my dreams cost
And I do too
I'm trying to tell you how
That's lovin' you
None of my dreams are lost
You see I'm with you
