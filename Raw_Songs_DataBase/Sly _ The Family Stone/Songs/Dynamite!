MISS CLEAN
She's so together and nice, yeah
MISS CLEAN
I got to see her twice
MISS CLEAN
I like the way she moves, uh-huh

When I was through
She turned on the light
Made my heart beat dynamite
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite

MISS CLEAN
Give that girl a hand, yeah
MISS CLEAN
She's got a beautiful tan
MISS CLEAN
Straight to my head, uh-huh 
MISS CLEAN
I remember what she said, listen
MISS CLEAN
Yeah, me and you
Yeah, I want you
MISS CLEAN
Yeah, me and you
Yeah, me and you
MISS CLEAN
You got me, girl you got me
When I was down,
She turned on the light
Made my heart beat dynamite
Dynamite, dynamite, dynamite, dynamite,
dynamite

Dance to the music
Dance to the music
