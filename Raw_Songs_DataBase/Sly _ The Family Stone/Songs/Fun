 Fun
 When I party I party hearty
Fun is on my mind
 Fun
 Put a smile on your face
Leave that bummer behind

 Fun
 There's a sister and there's a brother
Havin' fun with each other
 Fun
 Daddy always hangs up the boys
He just wants to party with mother

 A private thought cannot be bought
But you know what you have to do
"Socketh unto others
As you would have them socketh to you"

 Fun
 When I party I party hearty
Fun is on my mind
 Fun
 Put a smile on your face
Leave that bummer behind

 Fun
 There's a sister and there's a brother
Havin' fun with each other
 Fun
 Daddy always hangs up the voice
He just wants to party with mother

 Fun 

 When I party I party hearty
Fun is on my mind
Put a smile on your face
Leave that bummer behind
