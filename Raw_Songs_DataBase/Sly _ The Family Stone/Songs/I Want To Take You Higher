 Feeling's gettin stronger
 Music's gettin longer too
	Music is flashin me
 I want to take you higher
Baby baby baby light my fire

 Boom shaka-laka-laka Boom shaka-laka-laka

 Feeling's nitty-gritty
 Sound is in the city too
	Music's still flashin' me
 Don't ya want to get higher
Baby baby baby light my fire.

 Boom shaka-laka-laka Boom shaka-laka-laka

[Sly: Harmonica solo]

 Higher!

 C'mon light my fire
Want to take you higher

 Boom shaka-laka-laka Boom shaka-laka-laka

 Feeling that should make you move
 Sounds that should help you groove
	Music still flashin' me
 Take your places
I want to take you higher
Baby baby baby light my fire.
