A woman has a baby cute
Illegitimate to boot
Who can say it isn't right
Love shines a different light
As the world goes around
Everybody's getting down
How can you wish her pain
'Cause she has a maiden name
So you know why crossword puzzle

Ready for a party game
Learn how to drop a name
Who's gonna win the race
Why is it taking place
Physically you're on the run
Mentally applaud the fun
Turn around and look at you
Guess where when and who
Do you know why it's a crossword puzzle

Many ways to climb a hill
You just have to know you will
Should you even lose a round
Never let it get you down
Tell me how you lose a fight
When you just know you're right
I can offer one big clue
All you have to be is you
The world is a crossword puzzle to me

A woman has a baby cute

Everybody's getting down
How could you wish her pain
'Cause she has a maiden name
Don't know why
The world's a crossword puzzle to me
