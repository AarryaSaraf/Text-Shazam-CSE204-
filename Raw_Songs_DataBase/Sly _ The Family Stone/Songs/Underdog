Hey dig!
I know how it feels to expect to get a fair shake
But they won't let you forget
That you're the underdog and you've got to be twice as good (yeah yeah)

Even if you're never right
They get uptight when you get too bright
Or you might start thinking too much, yeah (yeah yeah)

I know how it feels when you know you're real
But every other time
You get up and get a raw deal, yeah (yeah yeah)

Say I'm the underdog
I say I'm the underdog
Say I'm the underdog
I'm the underdog

I know how it feels to get demoted
When it comes time you got promoted
But you might be movin' up too fast, yeah (yeah yeah)

If you ever love somebody of a different set
I bet the set didn't let you forget
That it just don't go like that (yeah yeah)

I know how it feels 
For people to stop, turn around and stare
Say goodbye and they low rate, low rate me (yeah yeah)

I don't mind I'm the underdog
No I can handle it I'm the underdog
I'm the underdog, yeah
Underdog

I know how it feels to be played upon
See you at the party
But you're really, you're really all alone (yeah yeah)
They just underestimate me

I know how it feels when you're feelin' down
And you wanna come up but you realize
You're in the wrong part of town, yeah (yeah yeah)

I know how it feels to have to go along 
With people you don't even know
Simply because there happens to be 
A whole lot more of them, yeah (yeah yeah)

Say I'm the underdog
I'm the underdog
I don't mind 'cause I can handle it
Underdog, It's gonna be alright
I'm the underdog
