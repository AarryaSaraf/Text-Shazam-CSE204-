My world
My wish upon a star
Is never ever far
My world
A feeling deep inside
My magic carpet ride
My world
The one thing I defend

She's my friend and best of kin
My world
My troubles disappear
Anytime she's near
My world

My world
The answer to my prayer
More reason why I care
My world
The joy in all my fun
A woman and a girl in one
My world

The reason for my smile
The mother of my child
So much I have to give
The life I have to live
The reason for my smile
The mother of my child
So much I have to give
The life I have to live
