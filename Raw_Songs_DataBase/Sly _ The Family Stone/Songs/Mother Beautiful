Who's the one who finally takes the pain
With you, with you
Suffers even when it's you to blame
With you, with you

Mother beautiful, you're just beautiful
Mother beautiful, can never behold

Who's the reason for my daddy's grin
It's true
It's true
Every season and she's my best friend
It's true
It's true

Mother beautiful, you're just beautiful
Mother beautiful, can never behold

Sometimes I say mama (Mother beautiful)
If I'm a here (Mother beautiful)
Sometimes I call my mama
Yeah, she's here
