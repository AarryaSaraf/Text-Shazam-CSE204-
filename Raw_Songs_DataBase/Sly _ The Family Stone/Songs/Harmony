You can be you let me be me
that's harmony
Simple as 1-2-3
Easy as a-b-c

Some people feel some life is dead
Better use your head
Work it out and you'll find
Surprised at what you'll find

Something settles in the brain
stop what you're doing and listen to me
Do you like me for who I am
Or who you want me to be

You can be you let me be me
that's harmony
Simple as 1-2-3
Easy as a-b-c

Some people feel some life is dead
Better use your head
Work it out and you'll find
Surprised at what you'll find

I have noticed more than twice
it's so easy to be nice
but if it's you to be clown
I would never put you down

Simple people start talkin
don't let the sparklings cross your map
Simple progress starts
Talkin people that walk in town
