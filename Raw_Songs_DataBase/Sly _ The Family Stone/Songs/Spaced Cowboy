I can't say it more than once
'Cause I'm thinking twice as fast.
Yodel-ayde-a.

Everything I like is nice
That's why I try to have it twice.
Yodel-ayde-a 

Well once I saw a bore,
Who was a social whore.
Yodel-ayde-a.

And they said I had a limp
And then they tried to pass around I was a pimp.
Yodel-ayde-a 

Was on my last leg.
I couldn't even borrow my friend's extra peg at all.
Yodel-ayde-a.

Once I turned red
And it loohed funny in the head.
Yodel-ayde-a
