Ha ha (ha ha)
Hee hee (hee hee)
Wha wha what
What is so funny
Ooh, goodbye
In the dark
The rip is jean
Imagine you see
The grass in the park
Ha ha, hee hee, whoa whoa

Well well well well well
Tear up my number
Don't call
Waking me up
At 5 am
I like my dreaming
Send me a dime
Get well
Good luck
At an oath
Pasadena

Ha ha (ha ha)
Hee hee (hee hee)
Wha wha we well well...

(No time for lovers)
(No time for lovers)

Ha ha (ha ha)
Hee hee (hee hee)
Nothing to do
You be the genius in you
Who cares
(If you are blue)
If you're through
Or 2
You'll never miss it
Ooh whoo (ooh whoo)
Ah ah
Me me
Pasadena
Ha ha (ha ha)
Hee hee (hee hee)
Wha wha wha wha well well
Tear up my number

Well well well well well
Tear up my number
I've got your number
No time for lovers
There goes my number
No time for lovers
...
