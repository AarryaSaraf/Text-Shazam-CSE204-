Are you ready (are you ready)?
Are you ready (are you ready)?

Don't hate the black
Don't hate the white
If you get bit
Just hate the bite
Make sure your heart is beatin' right

How's your backbone
How's your eye?
Add some bottom on mighty tight

Groovy people how do you do?
Let me dedicate my fuzz to you

Are you ready (are you ready)?
Are you ready (are you ready)?

Are you ready (are you ready)?
Are you ready (are you ready)?
