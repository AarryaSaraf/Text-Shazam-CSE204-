Greed

Do you know your neighbor's name
Join the rest who feel the same
Who can really hear your call
If they're out to see you fall
Greed
Greed
One too many is a crowd
Only plenty is allowed
Fe fi fo fum
Can't forget from where you come
Greed
Greed
Love is more than just a smile
It will last you for a while
All to win in war is peace
Let the people live at least
Greed
Greed

Who's got what's his face to blame
You don't even know his name
If the shoe fits oh beware
You might sometimes be unfair
Greed
Just little greed
Greed
Greed
Some of us will go astray
We can't always get our way
So tighten up and bear the cross
Lighten up and share the loss
Greed
Talk about greed
Greed
Just a little too greedy
Oh yeah
Fe fi fo fum
Don't forget from where you come
Greed
Greedy
Greed
One more time greed
Greedy
Greed
Talking about greedy
