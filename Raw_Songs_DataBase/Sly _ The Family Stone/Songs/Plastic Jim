All the plastic people
What do they all come for?

Plastic Jim
All his thoughts have faded
He cannot be degraded
'Cause all his friends are jaded
Plastic Jim

Plastic Jim
For 13 years of school
Might have a swimming pool
He just cannot be cool
Plastic Jim

Plastic Jim
He can't control his mind
Twice a week he's kind
The rest of the time he's lyin'
Plastic Jim

All the plastic people
What do they all come for?

Plastic Jim
Will give you a conversation 
To avoid a situation
That needs contemplation
Plastic Jim

Plastic Jim
With the cellophane smile
Ain't never been a problem child
But he will be after a while
Plastic Jim

Plastic Jim
Will take a blind man's glasses
Will steal a dead man's ashes
When his ego crashes
Plastic Jim

All the plastic people
What do they all come for?
