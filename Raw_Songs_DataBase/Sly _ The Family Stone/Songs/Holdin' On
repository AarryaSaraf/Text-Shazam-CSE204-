How long Lord, my trials are takin'
How long Lord, them files are fakin'
Holy Lord, let me ask you an answer
Holy Lord, would you fancy a dancer

I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier

Holy Lord, it's fine like I told you
Holy Lord, better listen while I scold you
Holy Lord, try, try, full try, you lead me
Holy Lord, I'm be around when you need me

I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier

Holy Lord, I'm doing what I want to
Holy Lord, forgive me, oh I need you
Holy Lord, do what you feel like
Holy Lord, the tighter the gripper

I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier

It's very common
Holy Lord
