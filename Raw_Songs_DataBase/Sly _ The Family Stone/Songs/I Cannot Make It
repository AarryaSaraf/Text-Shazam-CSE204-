I cannot make it!
I'm so hip!

If I make till tomorrow I'll be surprised
(I'll be surprised, I'll be surprised)
I am left with all the sorrow, look at my eyes, girl
(Look at my eyes, look at my eyes)

I been thinkin' I been fooled
There've been times when I've blown my cool
Said I love her

Get, get, get away
Said I love her
Don't be a fool today

The very next line will blow my mind, girl
(Will blow my mind, will blow my mind)
Yes, I love her but she's takin' all the time
(All the time, all the time)

I will not accept another
I would rather be her brother
Said I love her

Get, get, get away
Said I love her
Don't be a fool today

Wanna keep me
Cryin', sighin', dyin' (yeah yeah)
Cryin'
Wanna keep me (yeah yeah)
Cryin', sighin', dyin' (yeah yeah)
I wanna hear you say

If I cannot keep a watch on your daily news
(Your daily news, your daily news)
I might lose my head from havin' all these blues
(All these blues, all these blues)

I know then, that I shouldn't
Plus the fact I probably couldn't
Say I love her

Get, get, get away
Said I love her
Won't be a fool today

Wanna keep me
Cryin', sighin', dyin' (yeah yeah)
Cryin'
Wanna keep me (yeah yeah)
Cryin', sighin', dyin' (yeah yeah)

I cannot make it!
I'm so hip!
