I met you
Then I wanted you
You shunned me
Then I haunted you

Now we're together but it's not the same as it was when I first met you
It's hard to believe that you could treat me this way
You just didn't seem like that kind of person at all

I love you when you shun me
I love you when you fun me

I thought, I thought you were much more human
It's hard to believe you could treat me this way
You just, you just didn't seem, seem like that kind of person at all

Let me tell you one thing, now, listen to this
I remember that you made me feel so good just to be near you
You've let me down so much, I fear you
My love you been wasted
You don't love me, I'll face it

It hurts when I think of how you treated me
It hurts when I think of how you cheated me
It's hard to believe you could treat me this way
You just did not seem like that kind of person at all
