Who do you love
Who do you love
I wanna know
Who do you love
Who do you love

Now looka here
Who is right and who is Satan
Oh Lord

Who is mating while they dating
Sing with me
Who do you love
So you hemmed her in a corner
Doesn't mean you really want her

Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
Who do you love
Keep on going
Who do you love
Now tell the truth
Who do you love

Should you find a master baiting
Reason for our nation fading
Leaving is so little fun 'n'
Much more happy when I'm comin'
You know what I mean now
If you find a neighbor racial
What he's needin' is a facial
That's all
When you need to satisfy her
Ain't no need to pacify her

Who do you love
Who do you love
Tighten up and bear the cross
Lighten up and share the loss
Who do you love
