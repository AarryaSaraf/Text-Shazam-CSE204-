// Warrior //

He means to ride me on,
He sees a battle he don't want to face alone
I bolt upwards and shake him off my back
He falls to his knees, on to a bloody track
Well I can't be your horse any more
You're not the warrior I've been looking for
I see what you mean to do with me
I cannot protect you from who you want to be
Go face the Lord on your own
You have my love but it will not make you grow
I can't be your horse anymore
You're not the warrior I would die for
He fearing solitude, began to beg
When he saw I was sure, stuck a knife into my leg
Good luck walking on in your own bloody trail
This noble path you're on will send us both to hell
I'm just a horse on the moor
Where is my warrior I've been looking for?
I stumble some way on, licking my sores,
Tasting the memory of pain I have endured
Wondering where am I to go?
Well looking back on a bloody trail, you think that I should know
But I'm just a horse with no name
Somewhere there is other beasts who think the same
I'm just a horse with no name
Some place there's some other beasts who think the same
One morning I awoke to someone calling me
A priestess I'd seen once in some arcana dream
And she pulled an orange from the ground
Is this my warrior?
I am found
I'm just a horse with no name
Where are my other beasts who think the same?
I'm just a horse on the moor
Where is the warrior I've been looking for?

// False Hope //

Is it still okay that I don't know how to be alone?
Would it be okay if I'd just came home tonight?
We stay in the apartment on the upper west side
And my worst problem is I don't sleep at night
Woman downstairs just lost her mind
And I don't care how, I surely don't care why
Why I know false hope
Why I know false hope

A storm hits the city and the lights go out
Before I can prepare
The whole downtown looks dark like no one lives there
We stay in the apartment on the upper west side
And my worst problem is I don't sleep at night
Woman downstairs just lost her mind,
And I don't care how, I surely don't care why
Why I know false hope
Why I know false hope

She'll be alright tomorrow
Neither of us is gonna sleep tonight
We've false hope
I hear you begging through the wall
A dying animal's last call

Is it still okay that I don't know how to be at all?
There's a party uptown but I just don't feel like I belong at all
Do I?
We stay in the apartment on the upper west side
And my worst problem is I don't sleep at night
Woman downstairs just lost her mind,
And I don't care how, I surely don't care why
Why I know false hope
Why I know false hope

// I Feel Your Love //

Keep your love around me
Keep your love around me so I can never know what's going on
What's going on
Keep your love around me
Keep your love around me so I can't be alone
An electric fence, a silent defense to you all
You let me in, I loved you then
The first taste is free, then you had me
I feel your love
I feel your love

Keep your love around me
Keep your love around me so I can get along
An electric fence, a silent defense to you all
Let the river answer
Let the river answer so I can get along
What's going on? What's going on?
You must let me go before I get old
I need to find someone who really wants to be mine
I feel your love
I feel your love

Keep your love around me
Keep your love around me so I can never know what's going on
What's going on
Let the river answer
Let the river answer so I can be alone
An electric fence, a silent defense to you all
You must let me go before I get old
I need to find someone who really wants to be mine
I feel your love
I feel your love
Please let me go
Please let me go

// Walk Alone //

I think you were wrong
You said I can't love
I was put upon this earth not by any God or master
to know you somehow
In some bar someday I would see your face
I don't believe this shit
I was doing fine without it
Now I can't walk alone
I can't walk alone
I just need a little more time
I just need a little more highs
I just need a little something from you
Baby, I was born to love
I was born to love
I was put upon this earth
I was doing fine without it
Now I can't walk alone
I can't walk alone

// Strange //

I know you love your children
I know you love your wife
I know you set yourself up to live the simple life.
You get it all and you realize you haven't opened up your eyes since you were
young and it's so bright
When you try to take it all in and realize you can't begin again you wonder
how you keep moving
I can offer you so little help but just accept the hands that you've been dealt
Do your best to be a good man
Do you know how hard that is?
Do you know how strange life can be?
Well you love me and I know that, we can't let a precious thing go
I don't love you like you love me, I'm pretty sure that you know
Just try and bring meaning to all things and when you try to take it in,
no one wants to be alone
But should you fall in love with me, your love becomes my responsibility and I
can never do you wrong
Do you know how hard that is?
Do you know how strange I love you?
No I do not believe we were born equally
Wanna know what I see?
Those who do good will be treated accordingly
I know you love your children
I know you love your wife
I know you set your self up to live the simple life.
You've got it all and you realize you haven't opened up those eyes since you
were young and it's so bright
When if you try to take it all in and realize you cant begin again you must
keep moving
I can offer you so little help but just accept the hands that you've been dealt
and your best to be a good man.
Do you know how hard that is?
Yes I know how strange life can be

// Don't Let Me Bring You Down //

Living here is a game I don't know how to play
Are you really not anybody until somebody knows your name?
I'm not sure where that's going
Somebody used to show me, they don't feel like showing
Please don't let me bring you down
Do I look like I'm fucking around?
Love seems to be some kind of trickery
Some great thing to which I am a mystery
I'm not sure I can do it
You had it on me once before, I only just got through it
Please don't let me bring you down
Did you think I was fucking around?
I'm a woman now, can you believe?
Only one thing I'm sure of and that's that you deceive
What have you got hidden up your sleeve?
Some kind of release without relief
I'm not sure I can do it
You had it on me once before I only just got through it
Why did you let me bring you down?
Did you think I was fucking around?

// Easy //

You fell asleep listening to me linger on
about how it used to be
in the backseat
when we were young
When we were young [x2]
My oldest friend,
you know me then,
you know me now
How did I get lost
looking for God in Santa Cruz?
Where you go to lose your mind
Well I went too far this time
When we were young
When we were young we belonged to someone
And that was easy
I've got us lost so I've turned us off in Joshua Tree
You're my oldest friend so I know you then and you know me
It was a bit too high for me
I spent a month thinking I was a high desert tree
When we were young
When we were young we belonged to someone and that was easy
Well you cant be lost if you're not on your own
Well you can't be found if you're not all alone
Well you cant be lost if you're not on your own
Well you can't be found if you're not all alone
When we were young
When we were young we belonged to someone and that was easy

// Gurdjieffs's Daughter //

If they adorn themselves with crystals
to make them look sharp
Sleep with their hand on a pistol,
they're afraid of the dark
Well if it wakes you,
which it has to be known to,
don't be alarmed
Darkness can't do you harm
Fear will hurt you
And outside, if wind is beating
a tree to a bed
Don't fear that it might be meeting
some untimely end
They do what they're supposed
to but they have been known
to stand strong and tall,
weather it all
Take what you can
Never give orders,
just to be obeyed
Never consider yourself or others
without knowing that you'll change
It may not surprise you,
but pride has been known to
rise up a storm
Countless lives lost
at the hands of pride and I'll fall
Who'll weep for them? Sometimes I do.
I do sometimes
Who weeps for them? Sometimes I do.
I do sometimes
You can't see it, it might be behind you
Keep those eyes wide
You can't see it, it might be behind you
Keep those eyes wide
Don't be impressed
by strong personalities
Sincere words
are rarely sickly sweet
But if they fool you,
which they have been known to
Don't lose your sight,
know something's not right
and look at the stars
Be weary of being
given a name
if for some reason
you're not considered the same
Once they name you,
they have been known to
lock you in
Statistical sin
they'd rather ignore
Who'll weep for them? Sometimes I do.
I do sometimes
Who weeps for them? Sometimes I do.
I do sometimes
You can't see it, it might be behind you
Keep your eyes wide
You can't see it, it might be behind you
Keep those eyes wide
Keep your eyes on the back of your mind

// Divine //

Break the water
Make a ripple once in a while
Wake, it's morning we've been sleeping for a while
Now forget what you're owed
That your tired, time's getting on.
So lay down your load
You're fine
I'm yours and you're mine
You're fine
I'm yours and you're mine.
Hold tight stranger
I sense danger that wont show
Who holds the hand that holds the gun
You might never know
But when the note lingers
sending shivers down my spine
I feel in my fingers
that I'm one with something divine
It's divine.
I didn't drink a drop in weeks
All the waiting's only made it sweet
I tried not to freeze you before you thaw
Tried not to burn you and wait some more
When you ask what's coming you've already chosen
When you know you're winning you're already losing
It's divine
Now forget what you're owed
That you're tired, time's getting on.
So lay down your load
you're fine I'm yours and you're mine
It's divine

// How Can I //

We've been riding up mountains
Turning corners in our lives
We would have taken any buses headed for Telluride
But we stopped in the desert in the middle of the night and looked to the stars from the old roadsides
You look at me and said 'look at the moon, take it in it will be gone soon'
I'm taking more risks now
I'm stepping out of line
I put up my fists now until I get what's mine
It should have been you but it was anyone you see I never miss my chance to run
I will go anywhere with you
I will go when you ask me to
How will I live without you?
How will I live?
Well I wrote you a letter, posted out of central L.A.
Now if you ever come through here won't you come take me away
It could have been you but it was anyone you see I never miss my chance to run
And I would go anywhere with you
I will go when you ask me to
How can I live without you?
How can I live?
I'm going back East where I belong
Where I belong
But how will I live without you?
How can I live?
How can I live without you?
How can I live?

// Howl //

We expect dawn around morning
I trust the rise of the sun
I've been up late with the night birds
Begging the dawn not to come x2
Oh, how I don't want to leave you
So much I can't hardly bare
I have things I must tend to
Will you stay as you are, lying there
Would you stay as you are, lying there
Kissing the rain off my shoulders
Answering questions with stares
Holding my chest like I'm a wild horse about to run away scared
About to run away scared
Sun kicks the moon off the mountain
That is my cue to leave
The long tears of women are silent, so they won't wake those who sleep
So they don't wake those who sleep
Howl at the moon
Howl at the moon, I'll come find you
Howl at the moon
Howl at the moon, I'll come find you
I'll come get you
Hope that you haven't changed your mind
Be mine

// Short Movie //

I'm paying for my mistake
That's OK
I don't mind a little pain
It's a short fucking movie man
I know I'm going to try and take it slow
Bottled water, called a drought
Come on
What's that about?
Keep me sick to make me well
Come on, what the hell

I got up in the world today, wondered who it was I could save
Who do you think you are?
Just a girl that can play guitar
I think I could get away with saying only half what I say
No I can't give you up
No I'm not gonna stop
They know, but they'll never know why
They know, but they'll never know why

I don't know what we're afraid of now
I don't mind
Oh no, I don't mind
If I fall in love to the sound of birds on the wing, then kids, I'm laughing
They know, but they'll never know why
They know, but they'll never know why
They know that I loved you but they don't know why
They know that I loved you but they'll never know why
It's all kicking off
It's kicking off

Now it's a short fucking movie, man
It's a short fucking movie, man [x3]
I know
I'm going to try and take it slow

// Worship Me //

Little boy I know you want something from me
Yes I might be blind but I am free
Don't you try and take that away from me
Little girl I know you think that I'm a mystery
Yes you might be blind but you are free
Don't you cry and wish that away from me
It's God you need [x2]
We're young
We're young and lost and need something to put our hopes up
Need something to protect us.
It's God you need [x2]
Sit down and worship me [x3]
Forgive me [x4]
Sit down and worship me
Devote your life to peace
Sit down and worship me
Devote your life to peace, and breathe
