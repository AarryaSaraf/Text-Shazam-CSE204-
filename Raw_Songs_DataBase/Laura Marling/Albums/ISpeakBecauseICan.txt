// Devil's Spoke //

That I might be a part of this
Ripple on water from a lonesome drip
A fallen tree that witnessed me
Him alone, him and me

And that life itself could not aspire
To have someone be so admired
I threw creation to my kin
With a silence broken by a whispered wind

All of this can be broken
All of this can be broken
Hold your devil by his spoke and spin him to the ground

Root to root and tip to tip
I look at him my country drip
Leathered up by all his fears
But someone brought you close to tears

Many trains and many miles
Brought you to me on this sunny isle
And what of which you wish to speak
Have you come here to rescue me?

All of this can be broken
All of this can be broken
Hold your devil by his spoke and spin him to the ground

But the love of your life lives, but lies no more
Than where she lay your flowers grows
The arms that fed and the babes that wed
The backs that bled keeping her in tow

But I am your keeper
And I hold your face away from light
I am yours 'till they come
I am yours 'till they come

Eye to eye, nose to nose
Ripping off each others clothes in a most peculiar way
Eye to eye, nose to nose
Ripping off each others clothes in a most peculiar way

// Made By Maid //

They danced like sirens,
Hoping the sun would come out again,
And I was born in the fog of that day,
Could they hear a babe, under all that faith,
Or have they forgot what it was they made?

Crawled out of the fog, found a river,
Found a log and floated away,
Didn't think I'd be coming back this way.
But my feet resolute, found their root,
And brought me back to its place.

And on the hill where I was born,
There is a rose without a thorn,
They cut it off each year and give it away.

But can they hear a babe, after all these days,
Or have they forgot what it was that they made?

So left to wander blind,
I Find myself in cautious times, and they say,
Love's labors never lost,
But labor on to this very day.

So I walk into the fog,
Find a babe atop a log, and all alone,
Took him under, took him on,
Taught him everything about the world I've come to know.

He blames me for every wrong ever he made,
I'm blamed for every wrong ever he made,
Forgive me I am only a maid,
Forgive me I am only a maid.

But I can still see a babe,
Under all that blame,
But I am forgot from the day I am laid.

// Rambling Man //

Oh na√Øve little me
Asking what things you have seen
And you're vulnerable in your head
You'll scream and you'll wail 'till you're dead

Creatures veiled by night
Following things that aren't right
And they're tired and they need to be led
But you'll scream and you'll wail 'till you're dead

But give me to a rambling man
Let it always be known that I was who I am

Beaten battered cold
My children will live just to grow old
But if I sit here and weep
I'll be blown over by the slightest of breeze
And the weak need to be led
And the tender are carried to their bed
And It's a pale and cold affair
And I'll be dammed if I'll be found there

But give me to a rambling man
Let it always be known that I was who I am

It's funny that the First chords that you come to
Are the minor notes that come to serenade you
And it's hard to accept yourself as someone, you don't desire
As someone you don't want to be

Oh give me to a rambling man
Let it always be known that I was who I am
Oh give me to the rambling man
Let it always be known that I was who I am

// Blackberry Stone //

Well I, own this field,
And I, wrote this sky,
And I, have no reason to reason with you.

I'd be sad that I never held your hand as you were lowered, but I'd
Understand that I'd never let it go.

I'd be sad that I never held your hand as you were lowered, but I'd
Understand the world does what it does.

And you never did learn to let the little things go,
And you never did learn to let me be,
And you never did learn to let little people grow,
And you never did learn how to see.

But I'd whisper that I love this night now and for forever,
To your soul as it floats out of the window,
To the world that you turned your back on,
To the world that never really let you be.

And I am lower now and lower still,
And you did always say that one day I would suffer,
Did always say that people get their pay.
You did always say that I was going places,
And that you wouldn't have it any other way.

But I couldn't turn my back on the world for what I like, wouldn't let me.
But I couldn't turn my back on the world for what I like, I needed.

And I couldn't turn my back on the world for what I like, wouldn't let me
And I couldn't turn my back on the world for what I like, I needed.

And I shouldn't turn my back on the sweet smelling blackberry stone.

// Alpha Shallows //

He could fall and she can weep
But as holy are my feet and hard with mention
That dear they may not speak
We feel tight when there is tension
And our eyes can make us weak

And his heart was full of fire at the man he had become
And his soul seldom higher with the falsities of fun
Could embrace sweet desires and moments as they passed
But he feared it ever more, when he saw it didn't last

We walk up Holland Avenue 
And watch the rich as they consume
Their product made our hearts exhume an emptiness unrivalled by
A hunger that I could control, he'd pray up to his God
That he might save their soul

The grey in this city is too much to bare
The grey in this city is too much to bare

And I believe we are meant to be seen and not to be understood

And I want to be held by those arms
I want to be held by those arms

You'll work your thumbs they are sore
And you'll work my heart till it's raw
And you'll call and you'll call but you'll never be told
And I'll fall and I'll fall and I'll fall

We are basic lives
We are basic lives

// Goodbye England (Covered In Snow) //

You were so smart then
In your jacket and coat
My softest red scarf was warming your throat
Winter was on us
At the end my nose
And I'll never love England more than when covered in snow

But a friend of mine says it good to hear
That you believe in love even if set in fear
Well I'll hold you there brother and set you straight
I don't really believe true love is frail and willing to break

I will come back here, bring me back when I'm old
I want to lay here forever in the cold
I might be cold but I'm just skin and bones
And I'll never love England more than when covered in snow

I wrote my name in your book
Only God knows why
And I bet you that he cracked a smile
And I'm clearing all the crap out of my room
Trying desperately to figure out what it is that makes me blue
And I wrote an epic letter to you
And it's 22 pages front and back but it's too good to be used
And I tried to be a girl who likes to be used
I'm too good for that, there's a mind under this hat
And I called them all and told them I've got to move

And I'm out on my own
It's too hard
I'm out on my own
It's too hard

Feel like running
Feel like running
Running off

And we will keep you
We will keep you little one
Safe from harm
Like an extra arm you are a part of us

You were so smart then
In your jacket and coat
My softest red scarf was warming your throat

Winter will leave us
Left the end of my nose
Well goodbye old England until next years snow

// Hope In The Air //

There is a man that I know,
seventeen years, he never spoke.
Guessed he had nothing to say,
he opened his mouth on Judgement Day.

I listened with all of my might,
but was scared by the look in his eyes.
Like he'd already lost the fight,
and there was no hope ever in sight. 

No hope in the air, 
no hope in the water,
not even for me, 
your last serving daughter.

Why fear death, be scared of living,
our hearts are small and ever thinning.
There is no hope ever of winning,
oh, why fear death, be scared of living.

I have seen men provoked,
and I have seen lives revoked,
and I looked at my life and choked.
From there no more ever I spoke.

I can't give up that quick.
My life is a candle and a wick.
You can put it out but you can't break it down,
in the end we are waiting to be lit.

There's hope in the air, 
there's hope in the water,
but sadly not me,
your last serving daughter.

A friend is a friend forever,
and a good one will never leave, never.
But you've have never been south of what blows off your mouth,
you will never understand, ever.

You speak minds handed down to you,
by the lies handed down by your truth,
and your angels will dance at your will,
will mask your scrambling youth.

I forgave you your short comings,
and ignored your childish behaviour.
Laid a kiss on your head,
and before I left said, "stay away from fleeting failure".

There's hope in the air, 
there's hope in the water,
but sadly not me,
your last serving daughter.

Pick up your rope Lord, sling it to me,
if we are to battle I must not be weak.
And give us your strength world, and your food and your water,
oh, I am your saviour, your last serving daughter.

There's hope in the air, 
there's hope in the water,
but sadly not me, 
your last serving daughter.

There's hope in the air, 
there's hope in the water,
But no hope for me, 
your last serving daughter.

// What He Wrote //

Forgive me, Hera, I cannot stay
He cut out my tongue
There is nothing to say

Love me, oh Lord
He threw me away
He laughed at my sins
In his arms I must stay

He wrote
I'm broke
Please send for me
But I am broken too
And spoken for
Do not tempt me

Her skin is white
And I'm light as the sun
So holy light shines on the things you have done
So I asked him how he became this man
How did he learn to hold fruit in his hands?
And where is the lamb that gave you your name?
He had to leave though I begged him to stay

Left me alone when I needed the light
Fell to my knees and I wept for my life
If he had have stayed you might understand
If he had have stayed you never would have taken my hand

He wrote
I'm low, please send for me
But I am broken too
And spoken for
Do not tempt me
And where is the lamb that gave you your name?
He had to leave though I begged him to stay

Begged him to stay in my cold wooden grip
Begged him to stay by the light of this ship
Me fighting him, fighting light, fighting dawn
And the waves came and stole him and took him to war

He wrote
I'm broke
Please send for me
But I'm broken too
And spoken for
Do not tempt me

Forgive me Hera, I cannot stay
He cut out my tongue
There is nothing to save
Love me, oh Lord, he threw me away
He laughed at my sins
In his arms I must say

We write
That's alright
I miss his smell
We speak when spoken to
And that suits us well

That suits us well
That suits me well

// Darkness Descends //

You're holding bits of styrofoam
With your face painted on to your friends,
You listen to them whine and moan
About everything you can't understand.

Can I just say I don't fear the light,
But darkness descends once more into my life.

And suddenly we're all alone in silence,
So I take a step away.
I look up to the falling snow
As it makes its home upon my face.
Well I wouldn't want to ruin something I couldn't save,
The gap will keep us safe,
The gap will keep us safe.

Step away, get me when I'm down.

And suddenly I'm five years old
And I'm just so cold I want to cry.
I haul up on my gentlemen,
Who have always been there in hard times.
They're just not like that man of mine,
Who visit me from time to time.

My love, I treasure you.

I hear that summer's coming back
So I stretch out my back and travel a long,
The winter though it darkens me
It is pure and clean and all I want.
I'll apologize to the ones I love,
For leaving them when the sun comes up.

Too bright for me, darkness descends.

Oh well I'm not well again,
And once more darkness it descends.
The ground is falling under me,
And I can't find the means to leave.

Convinced that I am going mad,
Oh I bury my head into his hands
So sure that I'm loosing faith,
Oh I clear a space in his fathers land.

You deal with God far too young,
Before you know it your life has run away.

// I Speak Because I Can //

My husband left me last night,
Left me a poor and lonely wife,
I cook the meals and he got the life,
Now I'm just old for the rest of my time.
For he, Oh he, oh my

I speak because I can,
To anyone I trust enough to listen,
You speak because you can,
To anyone who'll hear what you say,
I swear it was not my choice,
I used to be so kind.

Never rode my bike down to the sea,
Never finished that letter I was writing,
Never got up and said anything,
Worthy, for he, for my.

Graceful sleeper,
You midnight dreamer,
I'm floored by your sound,
I'm floored by your sound.

I swear it was not my choice,
To reach out for someone wise,
I used to be so kind,
I used to be so kind.

In the breaking of the morning we'll be dancing on my soft lawn.
When you're shaking out the anger that stops you from taking my call.
When you're running up the highway,
Singing I'm the king, the king of you all.
When you look back to where it started,
I'll be there waving you on.

Never rode my bike down to the sea,
Never quite figured out what I believe,
Never got up and said anything,
Worthy, for he, for my.

// Nature Of Dust //

It's the nature of dust
That's all about us
It's all about me
And it's all about love
And that's a dangerous mix
If you don't get it right
And it'll come and get you in the dead of the night
Oh, it's a dangerous mix
If you don't get it right
And it'll come and get you in the dead of the night

And when they leave, and they do
Oh, it's bad, oh, it's bad
It's the nature of dust
That is all about us
It's all about me
And it's all about love
And that's a dangerous mix
If you don't get it right
And it'll come and get you in the dead of the night

Oh, it's a dangerous mix 
If you don't get it right
And it'll come and get you
And take your life
And when they leave, and they do,
Oh, it's bad, oh, it's bad
Oh, it's bad.
