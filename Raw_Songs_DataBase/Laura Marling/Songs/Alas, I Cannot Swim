There's a house across the river
But alas I cannot swim
And a garden of such beauty
That the flower seem to grin

There's a house across the river
But alas I cannot swim
I live my life regretting
That I never jumped in

There's a boy across the river
With short black curly hair
He wants to be my lover
And I want to be his peer

There's a boy across the river
But alas I cannot swim
I never will get to put
My arms around him

There's a life across the river
That was meant for me
Instead I live my life 
in constant misery

There's a life across the river
But I do not see
Why I should please those
Who will never be pleased

There is gold across the river
But I don't want none
There is gold across the river
But I don't want none

Gold is fleeting, gold is fickle
Gold is fun
Gold is fleeting, gold is fickle
Gold is fun

There is gold across the river
But I don't want none
I would rather be tried
Then held up by a gold gun

Saying work more, earn more
Live more, have more fun
Saying work more, earn more
Live more, have more fun
Saying work more, earn more
Live more, have more fun
