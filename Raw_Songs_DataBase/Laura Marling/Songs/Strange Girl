Get all your records out and throw them all away
No one left to listen to, much left, less to say
Working hard and getting on, still not getting paid
Stay low, keep brave

Woke up in a country who refused to hold your hand
Kept falling for narcissists who insist you call them 'man'
You work late for a job you hate that's never fit the plan
Stay low, keep brave

I love you, my strange girl
My lonely girl
My angry girl
My brave

I love you, my strange girl
My lonely girl
My angry girl
My brave

Build yourself a garden and have something to attend
Cut off all relations 'cause you could not stand your friends
Announced yourself a socialist to have something to defend
Oh, young girl, please, don't bullshit me

I love you, my strange girl
My lonely girl
My angry girl
My brave

I love you, my strange girl
My lonely girl
My angry girl
My brave

Changed how you feel, it's good to break the seal
And blow us both away
It's changing all the time and it starts to blur the line
It's supposed to keep you safe

And you row like a tidal wave
And you row like a tidal wave

I love you, my strange girl
My lonely girl
My angry girl
My brave

I love you, my strange girl
My lonely girl
My angry girl
My brave
