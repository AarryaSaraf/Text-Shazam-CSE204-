O bonny Portmore, you shine where you stand
And the more I think on you the more I think long
If I had you now as I had once before
All the boys in Old England could not purchase Portmore

O bonny Portmore, I am sorry to see
The woeful destruction of your ornament tree
It sat on your shore for many's a long day
Till the long boats of Antrim came to float it away

O bonny Portmore, you shine where you stand
And the more I think on you the more I think long
If I had you now as I had once before
All the boys in Old England could not purchase Portmore
