Break the water
Make a ripple once in a while
Wake, it's morning we've been sleeping for a while
Now forget what you're owed
That your tired, time's getting on.
So lay down your load
You're fine
I'm yours and you're mine
You're fine
I'm yours and you're mine.
Hold tight stranger
I sense danger that wont show
Who holds the hand that holds the gun
You might never know
But when the note lingers
sending shivers down my spine
I feel in my fingers
that I'm one with something divine
It's divine.
I didn't drink a drop in weeks
All the waiting's only made it sweet
I tried not to freeze you before you thaw
Tried not to burn you and wait some more
When you ask what's coming you've already chosen
When you know you're winning you're already losing
It's divine
Now forget what you're owed
That you're tired, time's getting on.
So lay down your load
you're fine I'm yours and you're mine
It's divine
