It's the nature of dust
That's all about us
It's all about me
And it's all about love
And that's a dangerous mix
If you don't get it right
And it'll come and get you in the dead of the night
Oh, it's a dangerous mix
If you don't get it right
And it'll come and get you in the dead of the night

And when they leave, and they do
Oh, it's bad, oh, it's bad
It's the nature of dust
That is all about us
It's all about me
And it's all about love
And that's a dangerous mix
If you don't get it right
And it'll come and get you in the dead of the night

Oh, it's a dangerous mix 
If you don't get it right
And it'll come and get you
And take your life
And when they leave, and they do,
Oh, it's bad, oh, it's bad
Oh, it's bad.
