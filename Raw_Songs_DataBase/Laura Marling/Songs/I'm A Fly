I'm a fly, I'll die tomorrow
So give me all you've got
I so believe, I so believe
I'm a fly, I'll die tomorrow
So give me all you've got

And out here in this foreign place
I have let you down
I've fallen for a foreign face
And I've fallen to the ground

I've gone in blinding, scorching sun
And fallen to my knees
And I've forgotten what I believed
And I so believe, I so believe
In the good in all of us.
