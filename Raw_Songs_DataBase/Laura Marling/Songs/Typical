Again I let jealousy blind me today.
My oldest friend and I blew her away. 
Just a few kind words and all I could say was I've known you of ten years it feels like a day. 
And oh I watched her cry, torn apart at the hands of a child. 
And again I used arrogance as something to depend 
and condemned all religion to pitiless end. 
And a politician's resonance rang through my mind. 
Patriotic in one sense the other just blind. 
Oh so many died, torn apart at the hands of a child 

And I'll keep on going I've got nothing to lose. 
I gave up morals when I took up you 
and it's boring to hear of another young truth 
and what typically shit thing to do. 

I was so shallow to the one man'd stuck around 
sunk so low that I nearly drowned 
and I screamed of his heart when he wasn't around 
Consoled him recklessly, I knew you were down. 
Oh I watched him cry, a broken heart at the hands of a child. 

And I'll keep on going I've got nothing to lose 
I gave up morals when I took up you 
and its boring to hear, of another young truth 
and what a typically shit thing to do. 

I have felt heartbreak too and I know what it feels like. 
I have felt heartbreak now you can leave me alone right. 
I have felt loneliness and I know what it feels like. 

But I kept on going I had nothing to lose, 
and I gave up morals when I took up booze. 
And it's boring to hear of another young truth 
and what a typically shit thing to do.
