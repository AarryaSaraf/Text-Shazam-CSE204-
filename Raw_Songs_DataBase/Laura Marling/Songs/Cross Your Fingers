Look down on the body that you have grown
Four mountains stand around you they're not your own
And light squares and bodies are all you see...
Since you broke down
Since I broke down
Since we broke down

Oh I jump into your grave and die
And on my word you'll give up your whole life for me
And you'll be reborn bigger and stronger
And less alive...
I... I...
I... I...

Cross your fingers hold your toes, we're all gonna die when the building blows
Cross your fingers hold your toes, we're all gonna die when the building blows
And the house that you were born in is crumbling at the corner
Sagging skin and feet of crows, feet of crows

I'll jump into your grave and die
And on my words you'll give up your whole life for me
And you'll be reborn bigger and stronger
And less alive...
I... I...
I... I...
