I'm paying for my mistake
That's OK
I don't mind a little pain
It's a short fucking movie man
I know I'm going to try and take it slow
Bottled water, called a drought
Come on
What's that about?
Keep me sick to make me well
Come on, what the hell

I got up in the world today, wondered who it was I could save
Who do you think you are?
Just a girl that can play guitar
I think I could get away with saying only half what I say
No I can't give you up
No I'm not gonna stop
They know, but they'll never know why
They know, but they'll never know why

I don't know what we're afraid of now
I don't mind
Oh no, I don't mind
If I fall in love to the sound of birds on the wing, then kids, I'm laughing
They know, but they'll never know why
They know, but they'll never know why
They know that I loved you but they don't know why
They know that I loved you but they'll never know why
It's all kicking off
It's kicking off

Now it's a short fucking movie, man
It's a short fucking movie, man 
It's a short fucking movie, man 
It's a short fucking movie, man 

I know
I'm going to try and take it slow
