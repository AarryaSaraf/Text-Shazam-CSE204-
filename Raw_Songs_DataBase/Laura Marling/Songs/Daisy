Daisy lives by the docks
Down at the white rock
Running an open home
Daisy lives by the sea
I only see Daisy 
When she wants to see me

Daisy's alright
She's up all night
Down at the docks 
Running an open home
I think that you look at her wrong
I think that you look at us all wrong
A woman alone is not a woman undone

Daisy met a man from Sicily
Sailed in one day and told her 
Who she was going to be 
O did he look at her strange
For no one and nobody
Is Daisy going to change

Daisy's alright 
She's up all night Down at the docks 
Running an open home
I think that you look at her wrong
I think that you look at us all wrong
Woman alone is not a woman undone

Daisy's got a baby now
She called her Angelina 
So she'd stand out of the crowd
Daisy doesn't care from where she seeds
As far as she's concerned 
She is immaculately conceived

Daisy's alright 
She's up all night
Down at the docks 
Running an open home
I think that you look at her wrong
I think that you look at us all wrong
Woman alone is not a woman undone
