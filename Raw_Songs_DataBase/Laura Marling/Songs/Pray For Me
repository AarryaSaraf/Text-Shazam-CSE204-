Where does my lover lie
I don't know I just lie
Pray, pray for me

But where he runs
I run in tow
And where you're from
I long to know

How does a child know
Where mother's weakness goes
And where, and where the trouble grows
Well you will speak
And it shall be so
And what you say
Will be all I know

There was a time of weeks
I thought dogs barked at me
And I, and I had lost my mind
And the devil had put
His mark on me
And called his branches
Shake the tree

That wasn't me for my trying
That was the devil and his lying
Trying to make me lose my mind
O pray, o pray for me

So you got my letter late
From where I permanently etched my name
Right, right into your song
I cannot love, I won't to be long
I will not love
I want to be alone

That's not me for my trying
That was the devil and his lying
Trying to make me when
I'm trying to be good
O pray, o pray for me

And where you run
I run in tow
And where he's from
I long to know
And you will speak
And it shall be so
I cannot love
I want to be alone
O pray, o pray for me
