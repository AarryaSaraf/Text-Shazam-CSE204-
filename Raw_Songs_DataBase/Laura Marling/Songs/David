I look west and I believe
There's the sky that David breathes
I look west and I believe
He looks east and he thinks of me

David won't see me anymore
I open gates that close his doors
Just to know he lives and breathes
will have to be enough for me

Sat down one day and I swallowed my pride
Begged him not to leave my life
There's an angel walking Earth
Once you've been touched
everything else is dirt

With a tear in my eye
and a lump in my throat
I read David's final note
Goodbye, be well, I'll think of you
'Til the Sun turns black or the stars go blue
