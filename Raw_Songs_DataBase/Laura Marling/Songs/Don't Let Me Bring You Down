Living here is a game I don't know how to play
Are you really not anybody until somebody knows your name?
I'm not sure where that's going
Somebody used to show me, they don't feel like showing
Please don't let me bring you down
Do I look like I'm fucking around?
Love seems to be some kind of trickery
Some great thing to which I am a mystery
I'm not sure I can do it
You had it on me once before, I only just got through it
Please don't let me bring you down
Did you think I was fucking around?
I'm a woman now, can you believe?
Only one thing I'm sure of and that's that you deceive
What have you got hidden up your sleeve?
Some kind of release without relief
I'm not sure I can do it
You had it on me once before I only just got through it
Why did you let me bring you down?
Did you think I was fucking around?
