When your work is over
Your day is done
Put down your hammer
Into my world come

Life is heavy
And you're no master, son
When you're ready
Into my arms come
Into my arms come

Love's not easy
Not always fun
And words are sleazy
My love is better done
My love is better done

Should you choose
Should you choose
To love anyone
Anytime soon
Then I save these words for you

You weren't my curse
You weren't my curse
Thank you naivety for failing me again
He was my next verse

Should you choose
Should I choose
To love anyone
Anytime soon
Then I save these words for you

You weren't my curse
You weren't my curse
Thank you naivety for failing me again
He was my next verse

I saved these words for you
