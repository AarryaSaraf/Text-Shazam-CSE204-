[Kevin Abstract:]
Was at the cookout with my other, other, other man, mm
That done got me into some motherfucking trouble, man, uh
Texas boy the way I love it, love it, love it, man, mm
All these new niggas they stealin', but it don't hit the same, uh
Feel it in your veins, uh, nigga, I love my gang, mm
That's why I fuck my gang, mm, why I fuck my gang, uh
Ain't no play today, these ain't just 808s, uh
This a murder case, uh, this a murder case, uh
Ain't no pushin' me, uh, uh, I change your head into Caesar
Ain't no hit on me, uh, uh, if that boy ain't seen it
He lucky that nigga still breathin', I don't know what y'all seein'
Take my shirt off, run off, then I swallow that nigga's semen

[Dom McLennon:]
Uh, done being humble, so I had to flex
Way that I rack up my bands, make 'em sweat
Forty acres and a mule on my neck
Better to talk to me with some respect
Heard they ain't make it, I couldn't have guessed
I'll cut the RAM, my connects, they invest
And I'm chiefing the keef of a pound of the best
Doin' it right take a couple attempts
Had to keep climbing and catch the ascent
Made it look casual 'cause I'm the best
Studio gallery over our wrists
Hold on, exactly what do you suggest?
Where I'm aiming, ain't no use to a vest
When I'm on ten, I get cream
But the scene that I leave is grotesque, it's a finesse, yes

[Matt Champion:]
Way she throwin' it so fast, you'd think she need some Tommy John
Surgery, nurse gon' pass me over, give me that scalpel please
Diggin' through this shit like it was '06, Pok√© things
Green Lamborghin' look like Bulbasaur and his dad (Wow)
Catch 'em all, uh, bubblegum ain't allowed, uh
Sittin' up on that terrace, drinking red wine with cantaloupe
Thousand-dollar phone, what the hell can't answer for?
I can't see the haters, man, uh, Harry Potter cloak
Let the shit rock, we comin' like a landslide
They don't call me up, they hit the cell, don't hit the landline
Feet up, sippin' hibiscus, ow, I burned my damn tongue
Sea salt on that cookie plate, I call that Atlantic crumbs, uh
She from Idaho, her friends call her tater thot, huh
She from outta town, she never seen the ocean, wow, huh
She asked me what's my favorite place to spend a lot? Uh
That depends like an eight-door bible box

// ANIMAL //

So many stars on me, uh, look at, they callin' me, uh
See, me, I need these dreams fast, look at me, I need that genius
Wave that them boys been on
It's okay just to bring them daps and pounds
I just need somethin' that'll make me feel
In love floatin' through the city
I just need somethin' that'll make me feel
Amazin' while I'm floatin' through the city

I turn into animal, don't act like you know me, oh
Don't act like you know me or my homies, you don't know me, bro
I turn into animal, I need something to let go
Don't act like you know me, baby, don't act like you know me, though

I just need somethin' that'll make me feel
Feel, feel
I just need somethin' that'll make me feel
Don't act like you know me, baby, don't act like you know me, though

I doubt I'll ever make it right
At least I know how you're feelin' now
Come on, baby, take a chance
I would never lead you astray ('Cause I want you)
I would never lead you the wrong way ('Cause I want you)
So let me show you it's okay to be wrong, okay to leave home
Okay to let go and blow everyone nose

I turn into animal, don't act like you know me, oh
Don't act like you know me or my homies, you don't know me, bro
I turn into animal, I need something to let go
Don't act like you know me, baby, don't act like you know me, though

I just need somethin' that'll make me feel
Feel, feel
I just need somethin' that'll make me feel
Don't act like you know me, baby, don't act like you know me, though

Is we coolin'? Is we smokin'? Is we vibin'?
What time is niggas on?
Is we coolin'? Is we drinkin'? Is we smokin'?
What time is niggas on?
Packin' my bags and I'm gone
Catchin' a flight in the morn'
Gotta leave, gotta tell you I'm gone
Yeah, I'm gone

// LISTERINE //

That shit they say, you know it's not real, uh
Me and my dog, we on the top still, uh
Swish around like it's Listerine
His bitch is tripping 'cause his lips on me, like

Kiss it, kiss it, ow, kiss it, kiss it, ow
Do you wanna roll with me? Now you know
Kiss it, kiss it, ow, kiss it, kiss it, ow
Ow (Oh), ow, ow

Let me know what's happening, guess them niggas back again
This for all my prisoners, specifically my Africans
I pray to a rhythm, turn a venue to the Vatican
I'm in my fifth element inside this vintage acronym
How we do it like this? This the life that that shit baffling
I rip everything I touch like my last name was Hamilton
What you niggas standing in? That shit look like lanolin
You ain't doing nothing out here, just amount to mannequin
Someone call the ambulance, I'm damaging these beats, I get to tramplin'
Moments that we making everything these niggas sampling
Touch of child abandonment, my ancestors, I'm channeling
Breakin' through the paneling, this what my niggas ambled in

That shit they say, you know it's not real, uh
Me and my dog, we on the top still, uh
Swish around like it's Listerine
His bitch is tripping 'cause his lips on me, like

Kiss it, kiss it, ow, kiss it, kiss it, ow
Do you wanna roll with me? Now you know
Kiss it, kiss it, ow, kiss it, kiss it, ow
Ow (Oh), ow, ow

Got a thick ting, pull up in an Uber
Take care of me, wet like a scuba
She said, "Bari, you the future"
We popped a pill and then we took a flight straight off to Jupiter
We seen all kind of things, stars is aligning, man
She kissing all over me, I feel like a candy ring
On top, I feel like a king, bustin' it down the ranks
My baby, she love me to death, above where the heaven begins
Wake up in the morning and do it again

That shit they say, you know it's not real, uh
Me and my dog, we on the top still, uh
Swish around like it's Listerine
His bitch is tripping 'cause his lips on me, like

Kiss it, kiss it, ow, kiss it, kiss it, ow
Do you wanna roll with me? Now you know
Kiss it, kiss it, ow, kiss it, kiss it, ow
Ow (Oh)

Southside

// NEW SHOES //

Still banging with the crew I came with
Westside Bad Boy, I can't explain it
Sipping on Don, nigga love being faded
Sitting on fours, living outrageous
Look at my dogs, they got us in cages
Look at my palms, the riches is crazy
Look at my life, living amazing
Came out the closet and ended up famous and rich
You bitch, you'll never see me complain again
Came from the bottom, was living with friends
Making it work, chasing them ends
Niggas was dog walking and job tossing
That hard lesson, came far from Austin
Never stop flossing, never stop bragging
Got me a uh, got me a present
Uh, uh, shit wasn't magic
That dedication, hard work's an understatement
Niggas was slaving
Thirty motherfuckers in the group, go 'head, baby, imagine them statements
Imagine them splits, living like this, living like this
Living like this, living like this, living like this
Living like, living like, living like

I wanna live in the south of Korea
I want a crib in Japan by Osaka
Lay on the beach in the Caymans for summer
And I want a spot where my neighbor's Obama
Sipping on something extra juicy
Man, you call it that citric fluid
AC off, this bitch so hot
I think she need some premium coolant
Hit your block, call me (Been around the world)
Eating that good good (Michelin star)
I'm so high, I been out of my mind
On a pillow checking out property on Mars
Oh, man, oh man, them old blocks can't slow me down
Goddamn, goddamn, I think I need to tone it down
Diamonds like water, I call 'em Cthulhu
She is a huh like Da Vinci drew her
If I'm doing magic, I'm swapping the bunny
'Cause I wanna pull a lil' bat out the hat
Bat out of hell, that's what I'm on
Red light on, young Amsterdam
If she ask you where you been
Pull out that passport, check the stamps

We stop the party with me and all my dogs
We staying solid even though we moving on
We ain't gon' part ways, racks stacked away
Funny how they looking when we passed them, ayy
We stop the party with me and all my dogs
We staying solid even though we moving on
We ain't gon' part ways (Racks stacked away)
Funny how they looking when we passed them, ayy (Merlyn)

I got a force (Force), it's pouring out my pores (Yes, sir)
Shippin' is first, that's just a matter of course (What?)
Never been broke, always been hard on myself (Holy)
Why lie? Niggas lie and win awards (On God)
Don't play yourself, that's a suicidal sport (On God)
Clout, but don't know yourself, what a curse (What a curse)
Clouds never block my shine, records show (Fuck up)
Why lie? Contract from Diablo (Bitch)
I sold everything but pussy and my soul

We stop the party with me and all my dogs
We staying solid even though we moving on
We ain't gon' part ways, racks stacked away
Funny how they looking when we passed them, ayy
We stop the party with me and all my dogs
We staying solid even though we moving on
We ain't gon' part ways (Racks stacked away)
Funny how they looking when we passed them, ayy

I set my tribe in, tribe in, ain't no complying-'plying
We can't be minus, minus, I must be biased, biased
Adjust your iris, iris, if you can't find us, find us
My pan been frying, frying, I cook the finest, finest
Bitch, I'm wildin', wildin', I might get violent, violent
Ain't no more trying, trying, you mad I'm styling, styling
My mom need islands, islands, my hood grew diamonds, diamonds
I kept on mining, mining, now I'm providing-'viding

// KEEP IT SOUTHERN //

[Kevin Abstract:]
Critique sauce, critique harsh
Have a barber at my funeral, make sure my niggas cut right
Line-ups like they fresh for a flight
My whole life been glamorized
So dramatize my sexuality, but, baby, make it sanitized
Just to make the motherfuckers feel it, 'cause it's hammer-sized
Deeper in that 'Lanta night, we all felt them 'Bama skies
Move my niggas to Montana, only keep a landline
Holler if you feel me, this feel like the night that 'Pac died
Finna hire more niggas that look like us
And when the ones that run your city turn against you, who do I trust?
I seen them lined up and loaded, some of them boys even look like us
Man, I love my cup, double up, and I fuck my thugs, that's love (Merlyn)

I wanna have it banging, keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it coming for ya
Right, tell them motherfuckers they cannot control
My life, life, life, life
I wanna have it banging, keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it coming for ya
Right, tell them motherfuckers they cannot control
Your life, your life, your life, your life, your‚Äî (Merlyn)

[Merlyn Wood:]
Fishing in Nazareth, tryna catch a bad bitch
Burning big bushes, but they never burn to ashes
Catch 'em with the baseline, bring 'em to my palace
Like how my mind sharper than a samurai tick
One hit of this make the sky redder than red
Ran for forty nights, float and sting like Cassius
Inside her thighs, that's aurora borealis
That's my mirror, mirror, missionary secondary
Sorry, baby, baby, know you lookin' for a hubby
But the blue faces only thing always entrust in
Yes, Lord, give it to me, yes, Lord, give it to me
God made melody so I could make money, money

[Kevin Abstract:]
And I wanna have it banging, keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it coming for ya
Right, tell them motherfuckers they cannot control
My life, life, life, life
I wanna have it banging, keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it coming for ya
Right, tell them motherfuckers they cannot control
Your life, your life, your life, your life, your‚Äî

// MAN ON THE MOON //

Hello father, what you know about me?
Do you know who you are? Do you know everything?
Hello father, what you know about me?
Do you know who you are? Do you know everything?
Sometimes I think I got it all, all, all
Sometimes I think I got it all, all, all, all
Los Angeles, you've been too good to me
Los Angeles, you've been too good to me
A mismatched friend, but LA's good to me
Place I call my home, that's history

I wanna kiss the man on the moon
And I just gotta say, I love everybody here in this room
Touchin' me, touchin' you
If I had to be stuck with anyone, I'm so happy it's you
I wanna kiss the man on the moon
And I just gotta say, I love everybody here in this room
Touchin' me, touchin' you
If I had to be stuck with anyone, I'm so happy it's you

I want you, don't you hear me?
I want you, through the clouds and the smoke
I want you
Nights like these don't happen anymore
Especially ones that last 'til the morn'
How can I keep you on the floor?

Get down on it, superstar
Get down on it, superstar
Get down on it, superstar
Get down on it, superstar

I wanna kiss the man on the moon
And I just gotta say, I love everybody here in this room
Touchin' me, touchin' you
If I had to be stuck with anyone, I'm so happy it's you
I wanna kiss the man on the moon
And I just gotta say, I love everybody here in this room
Touchin' me, touchin' you
If I had to be stuck with anyone, I'm so happy it's you

// BETTER THINGS //

I just found comfort in you
I don't want no other but you
Tired of the struggle with you (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You ain't gotta leave me so confused

And maybe I'll find a better thing
Someone that don't treat me like a fool
Onto a better thing
Polar opposite of what you do
Onto a better thing
Better thing, better thing
Onto a better thing, better thing
Can't you find the time?

I stay with the mic so keep the advice
You lookin' like a thief through my eyes, save me a slice
Runnin' through the streets in the night
And up on the front lawn
With sprinklers on, some wet shirts
A high guy, need a bed first
Need good weed and head first
Mm, we going headfirst
Ayy, 'cause I put the bread first

I just found comfort in you
I don't want no other but you
Tired of the struggle with you
You ain't gotta leave me so confused

And maybe I'll find a better thing
Someone that don't treat me like a fool
Onto a better thing
Polar opposite of what you do
Onto a better thing
Better thing, better thing
Onto a better thing, better thing
Can't you find the time?

Hate to love it, it's too good to be true
Easy does it, breaking all the rules
Undercover, outside by the pool
Grapes and honey, mm, chocolate-a-la-mode
Hate to love it, had to get a room
Hate to love it, yeah

// CRUCIFY ME //

[Joba:]
Crucify me, amen
Brutalize me again
The weight of the world rests on my shoulder
Day by day, only getting older
Perfect timing, I guess
Let's rewind and pretend
That we both knew what we were in for
Way back when, if you remember

[Kevin Abstract:]
Snakes in the glass that's like half full, I want it
My great grandma told y'all that we was gon' be a lot of trouble
Way before I was born, man, some time had to pass
'Til my auntie stole from the tuck, man, every day, was living fast
I crash before I even have a drink
My lowest points were formed standing at the sink
I gotta hide these tears just like a G
My niggas cannot see me go
You and me, NYC, finna be on TV, dog
It's like la-la when I'm all alone
Gimme, gimme bags, runnin' past all your concern
Gimme, gimme bags, runnin' past all your concern
Gimme, gimme bags, runnin' past all your concern
I feel like I'm blending, feel like I'm blending in
Too much in this motherfuckin' town, town, town
I feel like I'm blending, feel like I'm blending, blending, blending, blending
Am I just like you?

[Matt Champion:]
Dusty wallet
I want your name, so print it on me
Don't have to know me to put it on me
I got strong shoulders for all you fuckers
Go out to town with the miss and gossip
Don't like to add, I just sit in silence
Fuck all the fake, I want naturales
I want some property by the ocean
GPS don't even see the road end
Back when we kicked it on driveway
Even the pen, we were blas√©
Let in the world and just highway
Water so cold I would dive in
I know your love, it just cause wake
Thinking 'bout money, it's all good
Thinking 'bout money, it's all good, yeah

[Joba:]
Crucify me, amen
Brutalize me again
The weight of the world rests on my shoulder
Day by day, only getting older
Perfect timing, I guess
Let's rewind and pretend
That we both knew what we were in for
Way back when, if you remember

// DUCT TAPE //

It was cold in the summers when you're needed, yeah
You left us at the port, I couldn't believe, yeah
Now that I'm older I can finally see it
That you were tryin' your hardest and that you had to leave
2001's the year, I remember I could never breathe
My mama left, she had no choice but to go overseas
I held the baggage with me
All the things she couldn't keep
I had to get my shit together and roll up my sleeves
There was no runnin' away
All the times that we had, I forgive ya
You still loved me
All the moments behind when I missed ya
It's okay
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It ain't nothing (Nothing)

Kids ain't got nothin' to talk about anymore (No)
Out in the streets, restless, but wanting more
The kids ain't got nothin' to talk about anymore (Say what you need to say)
Out in the streets, restless, but wanting more (Say what you gotta)

And when you wake up on the edge of confusion
'Cause the one you love no longer sleeps by your side
I try to make you understand what's the problem
But I can't reach you like I used to
And I wish I take it all away, away
No one there to hold you like yesterday, day
I'm barely holdin' on, and that's just all it take
Only thing you seem to miss, you can't save

Keep my-keep my eyes closed, keep my mind closed, baby
Switchin' time zones, get it right for me, baby
Get my mind right, that's the life for me, baby
I don't waste no time, that's why these kids, they keep on playin'
Come out to the shows, I play they favorite songs
Peep this in my phone, right there, look, it's the telephone
I could do no wrong in lil' Jimmy's eyes, yeah
I am just a man with another side

Kids ain't got nothin' to talk about anymore (No)
Out in the streets, restless, but wanting more
The kids ain't got nothin' to talk about anymore (Say what you need to say)
Out in the streets, restless, but wanting more (Say what you gotta)
(Say what you gotta)

Dead to me, they don't mean to hurt you
Dead to me, ah
Duct-taped screams, blood all on the backseat
Let you free, ah
Be free (Just say what's on your mind)
Be free (Just say what's on your mind)
Be free (Just say what's on your mind)
Ahh
Free (Just say what's on your mind)
Be free (Just say what's on your mind)
Be free (Just say what's on your mind)
Be free (Just say what's on your mind)
Ahh

Love me or leave me, I never could choose
Thanks to you, thanks to you
It's over
I'm out, yeah
At your gravestone

Open the closet, welcome to dark side
Drunk driving, DUIs
Sneakin' my sips just like you taught me
Responsible degradation
Love us, lost love
I try, oh

You're the only one I risk my life for
What a surprise to see you tonight
Everybody's been working all week
Ready to release it all
You're the only one I'm glad to see here
Friday fresh from a late-night shift
This oughta be the best time
The best time of our lives

Goodbye horses
