The light
The light is worth the wait, I promise
Wait, why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait, I promise
Wait, screamin' "Please don't do it"
The light is worth the wait, I promise
Wait, why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait, I promise
Wait, screamin' "Please don't do it"


Sick of these niggas givin' me false info
Like I ain't grow up on MTV, Boondocks and The Chapelle's Show
Bitch, I can handle the truth, that's how I entered the booth
Look at these bruises I got, it gave me so much confidence
Back when I was making songs at my momma's crib
The candles lit, the temperature risin'
What type of man can find the right time to fly in?
Especially when my cousin dyin'
Should've never sold my soul, should've protected all my pantings
To see the world move without you feel like a daydream
Kool-Aid stands, band-aids wrapped around your beautiful hands
Protect me from the city, couldn't save me from the world
Back then, had Yeezy on repeat in your whip, no peace in my streets
And these days no license, only take the Jeep if my boyfriend is drivin'
Plus he got the kinda skin that make the police like him
Ever since I was a kid I always felt so frightened
My momma from the ghetto
Her vote go to any nigga that keep Jesus in the convo'
Me and her just get on good terms
Thank God for them unexpected turns
Breaks her heart when she see my city burn
Thank God for teaching me how to learn 'bout empty, even when it burns
But I hate that you got me in this box, expectin' me to see the light

See the light, see the light
All my niggas to the right, right, right
You see the light, light, light, light
All my niggas to the left-right, left-right, left-right
You see the light, light, light, light, light, light


When that hammer pulled back, did you think of me?
You were the one that taught me how to be
Look at me now in all my glory
Overcame a lot, that's a different story
Abandoned by the life-giver, lookin' back at my life different
Deep cuts in the dusk of the final gasp, before your life flash
What happens when you die? Does it fade black?
I sense you in my skin and the trucker cap
Miss it when we laughed
Didn't trust my intuition when I saw the cracks
I'm sorry, all I ever want to do is make you proud
Fleetin' moments, always found a way around the frown
Set aside the pain to celebrate the now
Couldn't kick me out the house, I was fucked up
Nothing to prove without doubt, if I'm man enough
What's the use? I could use you, 'cause I'm scared as fuck
Tuck me in, always young enough to feel loved
And share some, are you lookin' down?
And a child reachin' out, brittle bone, crying now
The past does not define you
The past does not define you
The burden was too much
Couldn't save you from yourself when you'd self-destruct
Couldn't save me from myself when I'd push my luck
To tell the truth, I am just like you
Left it all in the pistol that you used
Always be a little man, following your footsteps
Even though I'm mad, even though you're gone
You live on, and the day I have kids
I'll tell 'em 'bout Grandpa and how great he is
And the grandkids' grandkids
You'll never meet if it weren't for you
I wouldn't be, neither would they
It's safe to say I'll find a way out the darkness
The way you left ma hits me the hardest
What a shame things change in the blink of an eye
Fade away, fast break to the depths in the sky
Impermanence turn permanent with a nine
That's life, that's life

The light is worth the wait, I promise
Wait, why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait, I promise
Wait, screamin' "Please don't do it"
The light is worth the wait, I promise
Wait, why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait, I promise
Wait, screamin' "Please don't do it"
