Oh shit, I was just talking 'bout
Just that grind, the trenches, just
You know what I'm sayin', just all that
I mean, you, you don't get the vibe of it

Feels good to get this shit out the mud nigga
Made from hard times it's still love for the slums nigga
We rob niggas just because nigga
And I'll serve you anything but nothin' less than a dub nigga
And how it feel to be a dub nigga?
I'm tryna be a better man but nothin' less than a thug nigga
I kill shit, just check my background
This murder game shit my campground
Check my resume or ask 'round
We just simply never back down
I caught a charge, now I'm back out
I bet this carbon blow his back out
Gettin' money, that's a fact now
Bitches, they don't know how to act now

The poor more polite, but the flow not nice
Watch for your wife, I might take your her out ya life
She wet my white tee, now it's like a wet wipe
Respect my tribe, I'm a dog like Phife
Look at me like a check but my name not Nike
Bitch, my number not the lottery
I'm like don't even talk to me
Honestly wouldn't fly a Melbourne chick to Sydney
All of these bars bought chains, prison industry
America did my people foul, then they gimme shot for free
While I watch Washington's wood teeth in her booty cheeks
Kings of last century, was livin' like peasantry
I don't even like sleep, time is the only luxury

Sendin' a fuck you too you all
I'ma ship it, laminate it
Got this shit straight off the lot
We ain't rentin' no Avis
Got the neighbors goin' crazy
It's me, Bari and Flexy
I can see thru your bullshit like ya face was made of plexi
I could fuck around and get to soundin' like I'm whinin' man
Only crybaby is the one inside the bucket man
Who I'm the boogie man
You Never sleep again
Nightmares, it's fright-filled the moment Freddy tuck you in
Stack my money higher than the foam a top of tidal wave
Lonely like the point guard at the key got the isolate
Light it up, light it up
We bring the light show
Who the hell invited all they friends?
Fuck if I know

Dey at ya window
Dem boy callin' for you
Dey at ya window
Dem boy comin' for you
Dey at ya window
You bet not tell no lie
Dey at ya window
You know them boys outside
They at ya window
Them boy callin' for you
They at ya window
Them boys comin' for you
They at ya window
You bet not tell no lies
And they ain't comin' to play
You should not told no lies

My pen could be a fortune teller or an ATM
It's got intentions of its own, I can't even pretend
Every moment is a fight nobody can defend
The circumstances should've never been there to begin
I watch the clocks melt as the devil dances
The chances are slim to none that you could understand this
Lost language we incantin'
Pain campin'
Amongst the stillborn raindrops is where I'm standin'
I wake up breakin' up an eighth just to function
Rather be in neutral, than continue to get sunken
All my niggas made it out the motherfuckin' dungeon
Tank has been on E, but I gotta keep runnin'
What you finna lean on when the system is crumblin'?
Everybody reachin', but they really end up fumblin' when they touch down
Y'all don't appreciate in value like a bust down
My shit authentic, they can't ever get enough now

Dey at ya window
Dem boy callin' for you
Dey at ya window
Dem boy comin' for you
Dey at ya window
You bet not tell no lies
And they ain't comin' to play
You should not told no lies

I can see that eye upon me when I close mine
Drug induced comatosis leakin' through me blind
The body is the temple I invite spirits
We crack riddles and giggle behind closed blinds
Born to bleed
The brave and free got needs they gotsta feed
I breathe to see defeat
Fuck police and authority
Never means nothin' mind fuckin' myself to sleep
Had to take it to the streets
Capitalistic greed plague all society like COVID-19
Those dirty hands that feed don't buy it
Government officials don't give a fuck about the children
What do you believe?
Nothing's ever what it seems till you can't deny it
Flash points and flash bangs dictate defiance
History stuck on repeat in the loop of sirens
Terrorizin', always lyin'
God damn tyrants
Don't play with knives, kids

I tried to warn you
These boys, they don't know you
Outside, comin' for you
'Cause they don't love and they don't know you

I tried to warn you
These boys, they don't know you
Outside, comin' for you
'Cause they don't love and they don't know you

Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Sometimes it's like
Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Sometimes it's like
All or nothin'
Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Sometimes it's like
Fuck the world and all that inhabit it
Sometimes it's like

Just pick me up in the four door
I'll bless the beat with smoke and rain ash like Mordor
The warlord's comin', check the lamb for the slaughter
The envy so green it should be flyin' a saucer
And when the pressure is on, they gone
Ghost ride whippin' not your friends no more, so long
Snakes sneakin' I'm feelin' like I'm missin'
But never that
I'm still here bitch so God's winnin'
Lord willin'
There's no ceiling
They all pussy
Get out your feelings
Can try and run it up but baby I'm chillin'
I make my money then dip, stay killin'
Stay killin', stay killin', stay killin'
