I just found comfort in you
I don't want no other but you
Tired of the struggle with you (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You ain't gotta leave me so confused

And maybe I'll find a better thing
Someone that don't treat me like a fool
Onto a better thing
Polar opposite of what you do
Onto a better thing
Better thing, better thing
Onto a better thing, better thing
Can't you find the time?

I stay with the mic so keep the advice
You lookin' like a thief through my eyes, save me a slice
Runnin' through the streets in the night
And up on the front lawn
With sprinklers on, some wet shirts
A high guy, need a bed first
Need good weed and head first
Mm, we going headfirst
Ayy, 'cause I put the bread first

I just found comfort in you
I don't want no other but you
Tired of the struggle with you
You ain't gotta leave me so confused

And maybe I'll find a better thing
Someone that don't treat me like a fool
Onto a better thing
Polar opposite of what you do
Onto a better thing
Better thing, better thing
Onto a better thing, better thing
Can't you find the time?

Hate to love it, it's too good to be true
Easy does it, breaking all the rules
Undercover, outside by the pool
Grapes and honey, mm, chocolate-a-la-mode
Hate to love it, had to get a room
Hate to love it, yeah
