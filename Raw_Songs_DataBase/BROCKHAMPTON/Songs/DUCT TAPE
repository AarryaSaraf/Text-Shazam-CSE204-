It was cold in the summers when you're needed, yeah
You left us at the port, I couldn't believe, yeah
Now that I'm older I can finally see it
That you were tryin' your hardest and that you had to leave
2001's the year, I remember I could never breathe
My mama left, she had no choice but to go overseas
I held the baggage with me
All the things she couldn't keep
I had to get my shit together and roll up my sleeves
There was no runnin' away
All the times that we had, I forgive ya
You still loved me
All the moments behind when I missed ya
It's okay
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It ain't nothing (Nothing)

Kids ain't got nothin' to talk about anymore (No)
Out in the streets, restless, but wanting more
The kids ain't got nothin' to talk about anymore (Say what you need to say)
Out in the streets, restless, but wanting more (Say what you gotta)

And when you wake up on the edge of confusion
'Cause the one you love no longer sleeps by your side
I try to make you understand what's the problem
But I can't reach you like I used to
And I wish I take it all away, away
No one there to hold you like yesterday, day
I'm barely holdin' on, and that's just all it take
Only thing you seem to miss, you can't save

Keep my-keep my eyes closed, keep my mind closed, baby
Switchin' time zones, get it right for me, baby
Get my mind right, that's the life for me, baby
I don't waste no time, that's why these kids, they keep on playin'
Come out to the shows, I play they favorite songs
Peep this in my phone, right there, look, it's the telephone
I could do no wrong in lil' Jimmy's eyes, yeah
I am just a man with another side

Kids ain't got nothin' to talk about anymore (No)
Out in the streets, restless, but wanting more
The kids ain't got nothin' to talk about anymore (Say what you need to say)
Out in the streets, restless, but wanting more (Say what you gotta)
(Say what you gotta)

Dead to me, they don't mean to hurt you
Dead to me, ah
Duct-taped screams, blood all on the backseat
Let you free, ah
Be free (Just say what's on your mind)
Be free (Just say what's on your mind)
Be free (Just say what's on your mind)
Ahh
Free (Just say what's on your mind)
Be free (Just say what's on your mind)
Be free (Just say what's on your mind)
Be free (Just say what's on your mind)
Ahh
