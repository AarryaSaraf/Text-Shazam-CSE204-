I did this all for you

I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you put me through
They're oh so old, be new!
I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you've put me through
That's old news

I wish it didn't end like this
You stopped lovin' me a long time ago, didn't notice
Pardon the waves, couldn't contain how I feel 'bout it
Easy to say I am to blame, no other way around it
How you say you don't love me like you used to
Solitude is becoming so unusual
Old news that you rush into everything
That's why I'm stuck here tellin' you, you

I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you put me through
They're oh so old, be new
I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you've put me through
That's old news

Say less
Rain check
We friends
I guess
I got regrets
Hop in Lexus
You don't hear me but I bought your earrings
From the PJ's, treat you like a heiress
I ain't trickin', but I got it for your hair and nails
I'm always treat 'em too good and it always fails
You a angel I'm the one that tripped and fell
Can't let go, I missed my own fairytale

I'm out my head, I'm in my notebook
I'm feeling hopeful
I joined The Band in Dylan's tour bus
Turn up my vocals
Still making faces at your GoPro
Like fuck the promo
I'll do the live show for a one horse town
The blue-black behind my eyelids of an unheard sound
The words cracked into a silence of a sun gone down
But no regrets Coyote Baby
You can watch me howl
We're just so different, you and I
I guess we both know now

I did this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you put me through
They're oh so old, be new
Idid this all for you
What more I gotta prove?
The games you've put me through
That's old news

Wish I knew what it meant
When I said I loved you (I love you)
Rips in the threads of the net
I fell through (Ah)
What I gotta do for you?
Bet my life
Paid the price
Almost died
Shit was tight (For real)
What a life to lose
Beautiful and tragic, it rang true
Pleasure and pain, both remain (They do)
I was amazed in the maze with you
Said what I meant
Meant what I said too
If you only knew...
