Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties

Some days I just don't feel it (Don't feel it)
Some days I want my days to pass right by and change my spirits (Yeah)
Your hatin' made me fearless (Me fearless)
If it do not make me happy or bread
Then, dawg, well, I just can't deal with it (Deal with it)
Swear to God I'm 'bout my business (My business, yeah)
Got both of these boys kissin' (Straight kissin')
These drinks, they got me spinnin' (Spinnin')
B boy, the way they twistin' up my words
For months they said I was missin'
Man, the world ain't out to get ya
They just tryna dismiss ya, 'miss ya, 'miss ya

They keep twistin' up my words, shawty (Yeah)
Got me stuck right in the dirt, shawty (Yeah)
All day, all night, I worry, shawty like (The luxury suite with the marble floors)
Shawty like, shawty like (Yeah, ooh)
They keep twistin' up my words, shawty (Yeah)
Got me stuck right in the dirt, shawty (Ooh, fun)
I think all night, I worry, shawty like
Shawty like, shawty like (The luxury suite with the marble floors)

Tryna' drag my name in the dirt
There they go twistin' my words
Talkin' 'bout this what he say she say
Tell'em I don't give a fuck
Tell'em It ain't my concern
You ain't gotta be in my world
Talkin' 'bout this what he say she say
I don't give a fuck
(Give a fuck, give a fuck)
Stay ridin' 'round with my team, we don't give a fuck
I keep my space serene, still don't give a fuck
They don't wanna see me gleam, I been knew wassup

(Yeah, okay, yeah)
My attention span is outrageous
So invested 'til you come faceless
Where's the finish line that I can walk towards?
'Cause otherwise I'm on vacation
My location gone, my dick is long
I'm up and down till I make a song
Now tell me what I'm doin' wrong
So I can leave your ass and I make you feel neglected
Paranoid and uninvested
My money's gone but there's a bigger picture I got goin' on
"Who you signin' to?"
"When the album come?"
"When your next shit drop can you make a song that goes to the lines of goin' through?"
'Cause your new shit's good, but I gotta say
When I heard those chords I was blown away
Nah, fuck that, my family just wants their son back
Lucky me, I'm just a scumbag
I watch a little TV, then it's back to the lab again
Workin' nights 'cause I wanna compete with producers
Out do these brain-dead losers
Yeah, you hate me, that's excuses, and I hate you too
If we were in the same room I think I'd fuck you too
I'm done with playin' games, you lame excuse of a stoner boy
I'm tired of people weighin' me down
I'm about to drown in this empty void cause
Hey, I'm done with playin' games, shawty
Yeah, she wanna suck my dick, shawty

They keep twistin' up my words, shawty (Yeah)
Got me stuck right in the dirt, shawty (Yeah)
All day, all night, I worry, shawty like (The luxury suite with the marble floors)
Shawty like, shawty like (Yeah, ooh)
They keep twistin' up my words, shawty (Yeah)
Got me stuck right in the dirt, shawty (Ooh, fun)
I think all night, I worry, shawty like
Shawty like, shawty like (The luxury suite with the marble floors)

Nobody sees it like we do
Nobody knows what we've been through
It's been a hell of a year, but I know you got me and I got you
Now look at the love, look at the love
Nobody sees it like we do
Nobody knows what we've been through
It's been a hell of a year, but I know you got me and I got you
Now look at the love, look at the love
