There aren't really many people I would change for
But I guess I would change for y'all
'Cause you gave me everything (Gave me everything)

And you can take me
Any way you want me
I know you hate me
But what if I could change?

And, baby, you're still my best friend even when I don't see you
You're still my best friend even if I don't need you
Still my best friend even when I don't see you
I promise, oh, I promise

And you can take me
Any way you want me
I know you hate me
But what if I could change?

That's such a toxic bar, it's like
"I know that you don't like who I am, but I'll change for you!
I'll change for you right now!"
I'm always into the toxic relationships
