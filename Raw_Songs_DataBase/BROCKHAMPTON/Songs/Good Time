Yeah, uh
I'ma call 'em out like

Pack up my bags (Yeah), I know it's time to leave (Uh)
The show is over, it ended overseas (Bye)
Take them plaques down, it's time to move on (Time)
Call up my real family, it's time I go home (Damn)
No more changes (Uh-huh), no more playlists (Uh-huh)
No more due dates (Nah), no more fake shit (Ayy, but, uh)
I'll miss runnin' 'round the city with you, though, you know I cannot lie (You know what I mean, though?)
I changed a bit from a minute ago, you know I ain't that same guy (Why?)
I got a chain now, I got a lane now (Bye)
I changed my style a while ago and it still hurt that we don't hang out
Lost my tribe and gang now, yes, lil' bitch, and over payouts
Art hurts, but it's worth it, my dog, and so please, won't you stay down?
I'd do anything to keep you in my life
Whatever you need, I got you forever (Right? Right?)

And we said forever (But I guess)
Forever don't last too long
And we said forever (So it seems)
Forever's only long as a song (Don't go)
May not see my brothers, though
Please don't test my brothers, though
Young as fuck, broke as fuck
Sausage roll, gullible
Corner store, gas me, though
Askin' me which set we from
But I get it, we young, we dumb
Film a video 'til the sun get done

Bitch, them was the good times
Bitch, them was the good times
Eat it in the hood
Bitch, them was the good times
Bitch, them was the good times
Bitch, them was the good times
Special in the hood, hood
Bitch, them was the good times

It be so fucked up, I be doin' Zoom calls
Talkin' with niggas about personal shit
I'm like, "Yo, make sure we filmin' this
Keep the camera rollin'"
That's a toxic relationship
That's what our friendship turned into
I turn everything into art
