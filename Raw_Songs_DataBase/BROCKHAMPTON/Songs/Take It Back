God will love it, today, yay
Just be me, I will live it today (Oh, oh-oh)
God will love it, today, yay (Wait, you gotta love it though)
How could you not love it though?
Uh, yeah, yeah

Let's take it back to when, me and Ashlan
Was out front schemin', right off Jefferson
Had the hoes screamin', and the niggas too
Kept the trunks beatin', brought the noise through
The sun shine on me, California things
Tyler, big brother, California dreams
He kept me at a distance, California stings
Now I'm out in Calabasas where the choir sings
Praise God 'cause that man taught me how (Yeah)
To be myself and get my niggas off that couch (Yeah)
The group broke up and made me feel hot again (Woo)
If we talkin' 'bout groups, we still top ten
I had to save the truth for the last shit (Uh)
Anything I said before this was passive (Uh)
Had to saturate the streets with some classics
Then we went number one like Magic
Coachella, send it off for my family
Dom' Fike gon' say "B, look at this family tree"
Money in my bank account, I can't believe
Had to wash the blue paint off, so I can be free

So I could be free
Keep that shit rollin', nigga
We just gettin' started, yeah, yeah

I know I gotta be, strong for the family (Yeah)
Long time coming, who wanna start a band with me?
Merlyn been around since day one (Woo)
When he dropped out of college, we was there for him
That man's an architect (Yeah), this ain't the end for him (Yeah)
I wanna see y'all in the stands, wave your hands for him
Who would've thought we made it off that damn forum?
Man, I wish we got to play the Forum (Woo)
But next time, in another life, somewhere in the skies
We all will reunite
We'll have a cookout and you could bring the kids by
Your niggas by, your bitches by
Never know who is bi
With all them niggas y'all, I love them niggas y'all
United we stand, divided we fall
I'm sorry homie, but that don't apply to us at all
The next chapter is everything
That's my promise to y'all

God will love it, today, yay
Just be me, I will live it today
Mm
