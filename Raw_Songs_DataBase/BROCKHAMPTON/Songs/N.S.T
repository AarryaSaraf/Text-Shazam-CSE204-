Niggas they talkin', they ain't about shit
Pull off, 30 stay in my wallet
Mind gone, mind gone insane
Yo if it ain't a problem better not come to me
Mans keep talking like he a prophet (Woah)
No time to learn that we ain't 'bout it (Woah)
Mind gone, mind gone insane
Yo if it ain't a problem then don't come to me
I said
(Pardon the, uh, Technical Difficulties)

And I ain't taking "no" no more
Them niggas grew up on Screw?
What the fuck dawg, now we getting back to the beginning
You gave me scrimmage, I played the finish
Remember them old days I was fucking 'round with women
We was backin' up them drives like we was finished
Runnin' 'round in Corpus, two-door, I explore
Hit the gas then he floor it
We just took off with some more shit

Pray to God he keep my money straight
One-four SUV behind me like motorcade
Shot on that bitch at an alarming rate
Chills in your body they glisten and shimmer like you just went out of the armory, uh-uh
Move he dippin and dive whenever you cry, I will arrive
Blood, sweat and tears will let you go fly
But how do you float, uh-uh, staying afloat, uh-uh
Shorty be tip, coning in Burt
Shoutout Kids Club, we ain't Kelly
I'm going fast you ready, I keep the celly on silent
I hope the future is vibrant, for all of my brothers all of my kin
All of my gang

Big trauma, stone-cold stunner (Woo)
Shotgunner, hot like summer
My lover, ain't no sucker
She'll break your windows, that's no fun, uh
Big trauma, stone-cold stunner (Woo)
Shotgunner, hot like summer
My lover, ain't no sucker
She'll break your windows, that's no fun, uh

Close the door
Watch me go out
I'm gettin' closer to God
Pimpin' ain't easy, niggas all resent me
While you talking big I'll be still pimpin'
Pimpin' ain't easy, niggas all resent me
While you talking big I'll be
Pimpin' ain't easy, niggas all resent me
While you talking big I'll be still pimpin'
