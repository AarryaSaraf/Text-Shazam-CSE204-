Angels watchin' over me, God damn
Hope the homies rest in peace, I can't
As I sink in the concrete
I throw a prayer to the old me


Twenty-five, they said twenty-five, the P on one side, he just turned eighteen
Sun shinin' when they hit my cousin, it was like a mob passed him, an okay day
Shit, some nights I see him 'tween the shadows and the smoke, man
God could watch me sin, he turned away from all my flaws, man


.45, he got a.45 and I pray to God he don't bring it, man
Sunset, just another text, and that last semester ain't mean a thing
Everything that's evil make me feel alive
Know my niggas on the Southside got my back tonight

If you want it, I got it, you want it, I got it
Can you tell that I'm high? (Ooh, ooh)
If you want it, I got it, you want it, I got it, now (High, high)


Smokin' on that fishbone, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, huh
Walkin' 'round with my chest pumped, like, yeah, yeah, yeah
Talk down, you get shot down, like, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ain't no rest in here, what you say? We don't care, yeah, ayy
Smokin' on that fishbone, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
Walkin' 'round with my chest pumped, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
Talk down, you get shot down, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
Ain't no rest in here, what you say? We don't care


Where my four-four? Where my po-po?
Po-po said can't have more, they said, "I got no drugs"
They say, "Yo man, you drunk?" They said, "Drunk man, you lose"
They said, "Drunk man, come close," I was very confused
I got friends that kill, I got friends that died
I got many woes, I got many wives
I got enemies, and I roll the dice, ayy-yeah, ayy-yeah-yeah
I got enemies, ayy-yeah, ayy-yeah-yeah


Smokin' on that fishbone, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, huh
Walkin' 'round with my chest pumped, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, huh
Talk down, you get shot down, like, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ain't no rest in here, what you say? We don't care, ayy
Smokin' on that fishbone, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
Walkin' 'round with my chest pumped, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
Talk down, you get shot down, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
Ain't no rest in here, what you say? We don't care
