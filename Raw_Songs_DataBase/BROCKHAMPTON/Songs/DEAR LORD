Dear Lord
Lord, will You come down and help out my brother
So please Lord
He needs You more
I want You to let him know that he's still loved
So when Your love shines through like the light
Let him know You want him to fight (Where do I go now?)
So God bless you, love
Heal him with Your light
Oh, you're prayin' all the time
He'll show you to the light
Hold him in Your light
Hold him in Your light
Show him Your light, aw yeah
So when Your love shines through like the light
Let him know You want him to fight
Waiting by Your side
He just needs Your love and Your light
