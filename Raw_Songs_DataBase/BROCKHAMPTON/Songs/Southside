Don't give a fuck if they judge us
It's my life, so so what?
Moved out just to blow up
Three tapes, blow up
Whole fam' show up
Remember you don't know us

Bitch boy, quit actin' like you know me
You gon' make me wild out, you keep actin' funny

For my folks I ride, you know I do that, yeah
Music's so loud, feel stupid, yeah
Decked out the crib with computers, yeah
I know you feel it in the music, yeah
All the old cribs look like a museum
Van Nuys and south side was ruthless, yeah

Bitch boy, quit actin' like you know me
You gon' make me wild out, you keep actin' funny

Keep the hunger, yeah, know me, yeah, look at me, point and stare
Go into a new year with the vision hella clear
Yeah, they keep it delicate, growin' up, I'm barely rich
This that reminiscin' shit, remind me of the early shit
Shit that we was on when the sun felt sunny
Shit that we was on when music was not money

Bitch boy, quit actin' like you know me
You gon' make me wild out, you keep actin' funny

Hello? Hello?
Yo, Ian?
