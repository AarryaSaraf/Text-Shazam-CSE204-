So many stars on me, uh, look at, they callin' me, uh
See, me, I need these dreams fast, look at me, I need that genius
Wave that them boys been on
It's okay just to bring them daps and pounds
I just need somethin' that'll make me feel
In love floatin' through the city
I just need somethin' that'll make me feel
Amazin' while I'm floatin' through the city

I turn into animal, don't act like you know me, oh
Don't act like you know me or my homies, you don't know me, bro
I turn into animal, I need something to let go
Don't act like you know me, baby, don't act like you know me, though

I just need somethin' that'll make me feel
Feel, feel
I just need somethin' that'll make me feel
Don't act like you know me, baby, don't act like you know me, though

I doubt I'll ever make it right
At least I know how you're feelin' now
Come on, baby, take a chance
I would never lead you astray ('Cause I want you)
I would never lead you the wrong way ('Cause I want you)
So let me show you it's okay to be wrong, okay to leave home
Okay to let go and blow everyone nose

I turn into animal, don't act like you know me, oh
Don't act like you know me or my homies, you don't know me, bro
I turn into animal, I need something to let go
Don't act like you know me, baby, don't act like you know me, though

I just need somethin' that'll make me feel
Feel, feel
I just need somethin' that'll make me feel
Don't act like you know me, baby, don't act like you know me, though

Is we coolin'? Is we smokin'? Is we vibin'?
What time is niggas on?
Is we coolin'? Is we drinkin'? Is we smokin'?
What time is niggas on?
Packin' my bags and I'm gone
Catchin' a flight in the morn'
Gotta leave, gotta tell you I'm gone
Yeah, I'm gone
