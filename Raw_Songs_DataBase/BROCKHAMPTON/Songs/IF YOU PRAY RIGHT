Hallelujah (Hey), holy lion, word to Judas (Hey)
How I'm supposed to (Hey)
Trust that what you say is the truest? (Right)
Halie Selassie (Uh), insha'Allah if I gotta (Woo)
Spin my words around as if you wanted a mandala, for Nirvana
Singin' a sonata towards our karma
Did a rain dance, bringin' commas from Tacoma to Oaxaca
I got spirits in my heart
That make my mind move like it's water
Flow into the moment and avoid the melodrama
Gotta breathe for a second
Can't believe anybody still testing
My whole team is a force to be reckoned with
Operating like specialists
One, to the two, to the, "Who are you?"
Sending out projections with prejudice
My attention to detail is in scale with classic impressionists
So the lesson is that prerequisites are irrelevant to my standards (Right)
It's a deficit in your settlement
You better learn to mind all your manners (Right)
My whole troop been goin' bananas
Try and step inside of our jungle (Right)
You can try to take all your chances
We won't help your ass if you stumble, boo (Right)


Hiding at my partner's house
Couple bands inside the mouth
Instead of feeling trippy, dog
You need to help your city out
Hiding at my partner's house
Couple bands inside the mouth
Instead of feeling trippy, dog
You need to help your city out

Couple with that teflon
Couple with that teflon
Couple with that teflon
Couple bands ins-, couple bands ins-
Couple with that teflon
Couple with that teflon
Couple bands inside the mouth
Couple bands ins-, couple bands ins-


Watch your back (Ayy), don't leave your door cracked (Yeah, yeah)
Slither through your space and watch it all collapse (Yeah)
Watch your back (What), don't leave your door cracked (Woohoo)
Slither through your space and watch it all collapse
{If you, if you, if you, if you, hey}


If you want a feature we can figure it out
Want a color for your album, we can figure it out
Have you noddin' by boys who call it, "You're all out"
Then they copy, paste hard work from the BH house
I always got something to say
When you take food from my mouth
I begged my mommy for money until the day it ran out
They say we helped you when I win
Now you should figure it out
Figure it out

Waste your breath, watch the tone though
Take you to the dojo
Roll up my doja, sticky fingers
At the door, bruh, Jehovah, you hoe bitch
Witness sadistic shit, well come again
Next time I'll take my belt off, spank you
Back here, back seat, not me, got beef
Finally, body black out from rage
Childproof my pockets
Don't need the options
Romanticizing what I do if I ain't stop me
Can be off me, tread lightly

Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law


I'm tired of making a fool out of me and you
Is there anything
That I can do that'll save us, baby?
Is there anybody lovin' lies and robbin' shotties, .45's?
I'm still alive, and no drunk drivin'
That's how they killed my brother
(Walking with Jesus)
You know, you know betta, betta, betta, betta, betta
Betta, betta, betta, betta, betta, betta, betta, bet on it
Betta bet on it, betta bet on it, hey
(Walking with Jesus)
You know, you know betta
Betta, betta, betta, be-et on it
Bet on it, eh, eh, eh, eh, yeah
Eh, yeah
I wanna sing, I wanna
I wanna sing, ooh
(You tell 'em, tell 'em that)
Ah
(Walking with Jesus Christ)
(Walking with the Lord)
