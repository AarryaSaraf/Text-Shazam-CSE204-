Me llamo Roberto y me gusta bailar


What are the rules for breakfast today?
What are the words I'm forbidden to say?
I need to let my hair down and grow up like a real ass bitch
A real ass bitch, bitch
What are the rules for breakfast today?
What are the words I'm forbidden to say?
I need to let my hair down and grow up like a real ass bitch
A real ass bitch, bitch

I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like


My niggas takin' over
BROCKHAMPTON, call your momma
My niggas goin' platinum
Break neck, send you to the doctor


Best boy band since One Direction
Makin' niggas itch like a skin infection
Did me wrong like a perfect stepson
Been a wrong, you can change the song, hun


Who got me riled up?
Who the lame ass bitch wanna talk 'bout us?
Ooo, who got me riled up?
Who the lame ass bitch wanna talk 'bout us?
Ooo, come get it from me
Uh, come get it from me
Uh, come get it from me
Uh, uh, uh, come get it from me


Break necks, I'm the chiropractor
Come on down, you know I got ya
Real shit, feelin' saturated
Real love, this might fuck the haters
Break necks, I'm the chiropractor
Come on down, you know I got ya
Real shit, feelin' saturated
Real love, this might fuck the haters


When you see me in the street, they say "Willie, Willie!"
When you don't see me in the street, I'm like a hillbilly
All sad 'cause nobody wanna suck my willy
Not sad, everybody wanna suck my willy
When you see me in the street, they say "Willie, Willie!"
When you don't see me in the street, I'm like a hillbilly
All sad 'cause nobody wanna suck my willy
Not sad, everybody wanna suck my willy


They be like "what the fuck is you on?" when we hit the room
Move til' these niggas throw me in the tomb
Hear the sounds of the pharaoh when we spin the tunes
Everything feel right now you in the womb
Wanna motivate you in the afternoon
Top shelf money, that's my new perfume
Twist it up, let it in and inhale the fumes
I'm the one that's zoom if you just assume


I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like


Merlyn!
