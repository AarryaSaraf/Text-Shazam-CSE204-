Nowadays, all I wanna do is party
Getting fucked up in my hotel's lobby
Only made this to get out the deal, partly
So don't ask me if the crew is still talking
Do we see each other? Hardly
Shit we made together? Godly
Did we sign for too many motherfuckin' albums? Probably
Got my first gold teeth at the swap meet
Felt the temperature change when we dropped "HEAT"
Came such a long way from Corpus Christi
San Marcos, soft shell tacos blanco
All the rocks thrown, woke niggas on my cock, though
Is it a dream to see tomorrow?
Always better to make it
You can't become unfamous, your clout just start fading
This blueprint, we made it
Y'all niggas, y'all just be takin' and stealin'
The way we be filming the way we fuck a nigga up
But still gon' speak up 'bout how the fuck we be feeling
I ain't gon' let no white nigga meme my ass up out the building (Hell nah)
I say it with my chest 'cause for years, I just been chillin'
And let y'all get them bars off (Bitch-ass niggas)
While y'all bumpin' BH knockoffs (Poor bitch-ass niggas)
I'm the richest nigga you ever seen fall off (Facts)
I'm the richest nigga you ever seen fall off (Facts)

(Oh, fuck you)
