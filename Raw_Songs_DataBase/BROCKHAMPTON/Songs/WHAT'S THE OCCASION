A million little pieces
All add up to nothin' lately
Swim within my bedsheets
It's somethin' like a celebration
What's the occasion?
What's the occasion?

I know my sweat like cologne, see this house ain't like home
If I could swallow my pride, would you admit when you wrong?
I know it's easy to just skip it, flippin' out and you gone
Maybe I wouldn't be so testy when you came my for glow
Got dinner on the kitchen table make sure everyone know
I make my Sunday mornings feel like Friday nights
I feel like Boobie Miles under these Friday lights
Ready to pounce on any pussy ass bitch come for my life
I'm tired of validation
I'm tired of wonderin' what the fuck
I gotta do to save ya
You been in this shit for years, I can't be ya savior
Hearin' speech from Satan
On my knees, I'm prayin'
Everything I say breakin' into

A million little pieces
All add up to nothin' lately
Swim within my bedsheets
It's somethin' like a celebration
What's the occasion?
What's the occasion?

I stay runnin' from somethin'
I can't see
True colors blindin', fuck away from me
Gunnin' for somethin' I don't need
I lead two lives, find me
Who's to blame?
Who's to say I leave?
Forced to change, forced to face my seed
Break a bit, breakin' in timely
Good on my own but I've been feelin' alone
I gotta go, don't ask why
Watch the dominoes and the time fly
Either way it goes, scribble outta line
Get the picture, different from when I met ya

A million little pieces
All add up to nothin' lately
Swim within my bedsheets
It's somethin' like a celebration
What's the occasion?
What's the occasion?

What's the occasion?
What's the occasion?

A million little pieces
All add up to nothin' lately
Swim within my bedsheets
It's somethin' like a celebration
What's the occasion?
What's the occasion?
