Murderer!
Man of fire
Murderer!
I've seen the eyes of living dead
It's the same game, survival
The great mass play
A waiting game
Embalmed, crippled
Dying in fear of pain
All sense of freedom gone

Black sun in a white world
Like having a black sun in a white world

I have a son
His name is Eden
It's his birthright
Beyond estranged times

Give me sixty nine years
Another season in this hell
It's all sex and death
As far as eyes can tell
Like Prometheus we are bound
Chained to this rock
Of a brave new world
Our god forsaken lot

And I feel
That's all we have ever needed to know
Till worlds end and the seas run cold

Give me sixty nine years
Another season in this hell
There is sex and death
In mother nature's plans
Like Prometheus we are bound
Chained to this rock
Of a brave new world
Our god forsaken lot
