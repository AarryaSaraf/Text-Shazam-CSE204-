Migan asbet rafighe rooze jange
Mo migooyom azoo behtar tofange
Svaare bi tofang ghodrat nadaare
Svaar vaghti tofang daare svaare

Tofange daste noghream raa forookhtam
Baraaye del ghabaaye terme dookhtam
Ferestaadom baraayom pas ferestaad
Tofange daste noghream daad-o-bidaad



They say your charger is your pal on the day of battle
I say even better is the gun
A cavalryman without a gun is without vigour
A cavalryman is one when he has got a gun

I sold my silver stock gun
Sewed a termeh frock for my love
She returned it to me when I sent her the frock
Oh alas my silver stock gun
