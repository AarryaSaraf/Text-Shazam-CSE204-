Favoured one, fade on, see them run
Journey round, heave ho all night long
You've been afraid for far too long
I've been enraged in my song

I've been a rose in my rage
I've been a rose, I've been a rose
I've been a rose

Canaan ran, since her desert song
Canaan ran, rides on the bird song
You've been afraid for far too long
I've been enraged in my songs

I've been a rose, I've been a rage
I've been a rose, I've been a rage
I've been a rose
