// Severance //

Severance, the birds of leaving call to us
Yet here we stand endowed with the fear of flight
Over land the winds of change consume the land
While we remain in the shadow of summers now past

When all the leaves have fallen and turned to dust
Will we remain entrenched within our ways?
Indifference, the plague that moves throughout this land
Omen signs in the shapes of things to come

Tomorrow's child is the only child
Tomorrow's child is the only child

// In The Kingdom Of The Blind The One-Eyed Are Kings //

If it were within, within our power
Beyond the reach of slavish pride
To no longer harbour grievances
Behind the mask's opportunist's facade

We could welcome the responsibility
Like a long lost friend
And re-establish laughter
In the dolls house once again

For time has imprisoned us
In the order of our years
In the discipline of our ways
And in the passing of momentary stillness

We can see our chaos in motion
Our chaos in motion
We can see our chaos in motion
View our chaos in motion

And the subsequent collisions of fools
Well versed in the subtle art of slavery

// Song Of Sophia //

With one wish
We wake the will within wisdom
With one will
We wish the wisdom within waking
Woken, wishing, willing

// Ulysses //

John Francis Dooley
Wipe the sleep from your eyes
And embrace the light
You have slept now
For a thousand years
Beneath starless nights
And now it's time for you
To renounce the old ways
And see a new dawn rise

In former days
Masks were raised
When the god came down
From off of the mountain
And the sacrifice was made
For he knew the day of wrath
Was fast approaching
Just like yesterday before the war

John Francis Dooley
The scapegoat has run
All our sins are disowned
And now it's time for you
To take off your mask
And cross the Rubicon

If you and I were one
Within the eyes of our designs
It would still not change
The fact of our leaving
For tonight we must leave
With the first gentle breeze
For the Isles Of Ken
We are assailing

Just like Ullyses
On an open sea
On an odyssey
Of self discovery
