// The Wind That Shakes The Barley //

I sat within the valley green
I sat me with my true love
My sad heart strove the two between
The old love and the new love
The old for her the new that made
Me think on Ireland dearly
While soft the wind blew down the glade
And shook the golden barley

T'was hard the woeful words to frame
To break the ties that bound us
But harder still to bear the shame
Of foreign chains around us
And so I said the mountain glen
I'll meet at morning early
And I'll join the bold united men
While soft winds shook the barley

T'was sad I kissed away her tears
My fond arm round her flinging
When a foeman's shot burst on our ears
From out the wild woods ringing
A bullet pierced my true love's side
In life's young spring so early
And on my breast in blood she died
While soft winds shook the barley

But blood for blood without remorse
I've taken at Oulart Hollow
I've lain my true love's clay like corpse
Where I full soon must follow
Around her grave I've wandered drear
Noon, night and morning early
With breaking heart when e'er I hear
The wind that shakes the barley

// Rakim //

Favoured son
Turn in the garden
Shades of one
Sins forgotten

Favoured signs to find hope
In the rounds of life
Favoured rhymes to find hope
In the sands of life

Favoured son
Fence in your heart
Savored son
Sins forgotten

// Persian Love Song //

[Persian:]

Migan asbet rafighe rooze jange
Mo migooyom azoo behtar tofange
Svaare bi tofang ghodrat nadaare
Svaar vaghti tofang daare svaare

Tofange daste noghream raa forookhtam
Baraaye del ghabaaye terme dookhtam
Ferestaadom baraayom pas ferestaad
Tofange daste noghream daad-o-bidaad

[English Translation:]

They say your charger is your pal on the day of battle
I say even better is the gun
A cavalryman without a gun is without vigour
A cavalryman is one when he has got a gun

I sold my silver stock gun
Sewed a termeh frock for my love
She returned it to me when I sent her the frock
Oh alas my silver stock gun

// Desert Song //

Favoured one, fade on, see them run
Journey round, heave ho all night long
You've been afraid for far too long
I've been enraged in my song

I've been a rose in my rage
I've been a rose, I've been a rose
I've been a rose

Canaan ran, since her desert song
Canaan ran, rides on the bird song
You've been afraid for far too long
I've been enraged in my songs

I've been a rose, I've been a rage
I've been a rose, I've been a rage
I've been a rose

// I Am Stretched On Your Grave //

I am stretched on your grave
And will lie there forever
With your hands held in mine
I'd be sure we'd not sever
My apple tree, my brightness
'Tis time we were together
For I smell of the earth
And am stained by the weather

When my family thinks
That I'm safe in my bed
From night until morning
I am stretched at your head
Calling out to the air
With tears both hot and wild
Oh I grieve for the girl
That I loved as a child

The priests and the friars
Behold me in dread
Because I still love you
My love, and you're dead
And would still be your shelter
From rain and from storm
But with you in your cold grave
I cannot sleep warm

// I Can See Now //

Ever loved a woman
Who made you feel tall?
Ever loved a man
Who made you feel small?

If you were a sailor
I'd raise the anchor
To sail the sea
In search of you and me

And god conjures currents
To break our fragile boats
And both the innocent and the damned
Are swallowed up in his wake

If you were a huntress
I'd be your bow
For your silver arrows
To seek out his heart

Ever loved a woman
Who made you feel tall?
Ever loved a man
Who made you feel small?

Who are you to complain
For lack of understanding?
We are all created equal
In just one thing alone

Alone in your thoughts
That consume you through your life
They'll take you outwards
To the dark edge of time

And there's nothing more dangerous
Than a man with nothing to lose
Nothing to live for
And nothing to prove

// American Dreaming //

I need my conscience to keep watch over me
To protect me from myself
So I can wear honesty like a crown on my head
When I walk into the promised land

We've been too long American dreaming
I think we've all lost the way
Forlorn somnambulistic maniacal
In the dark

I'm in love with an American girl
Well, she's my best friend
I love her surreptitious smile
That hides the pain within her

And we'll go dancing in the rings of laughter
And leave alone by the shores
Feel alone in the brands of rapture
And leave alone for the loss

Yeah, on the lea the rising wind blows
Yeah, on the lea the rising wind blows
How long? How long?

Here alone on the grounds of allegiances
We've left behind
Turned back by the foot of the doorway
Never lost and found

We've been too long American dreaming
I think we've all lost the heart
Forlorn somnambulistic maniacal
In the dark

Yeah, on the lea the rising wind blows
Yeah, on the lea the rising wind blows
How long? How long?

// Oman //

From the body to the soul
Where our hearts lead we must go
Wherever love may flow

// Don't Fade Away //

Don't fade away
My brown eyed girl
Come walk with me
I'll fill your heart with joy

And we'll dance through our isolation
Seeking solace in the wisdom we bestow
Turning thoughts to the here and ever after
Consuming fears in our fiery halos

Say what you mean
Mean what you say
I've heard that innocence
Has led us all astray

But don't let them make you and break you
The world is filled with their broken empty dreams
Silence is their only virtue
Locked away inside their silent screams

But for now let us dance away this starry night
Filled with the glow of fiery stars
And with the dawn our sun will rise
Bringing a symphony of bird cries

Don't bring me down now
Let me stay here for a while
You know life's too short
Let me bathe here in your smile

I'm transcending
The fall from the garden

Goodnight
