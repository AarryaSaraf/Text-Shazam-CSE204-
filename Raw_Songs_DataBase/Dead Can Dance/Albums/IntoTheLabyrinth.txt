Album: IntoTheLabyrinth

// The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove //

I thought that you knew it all
Well you've seen it ten times before.
I thought that you had it down
With both your feet on the ground.
I love slow...slow but deep.
Feigned affections wash over me.
Dream on my dear
And renounce temporal obligations.
Dream on my dear
It's a sleep from which you may not awaken.

You build me up then you knock me down.
You play the fool while I play the clown.
We keep time to the beat of an old slave drum.
You raise my hopes then you raise the odds
You tell me that I dream too much
Now I'm serving time in disillusionment.

I don't believe you anymore...I don't believe you.

I thought that I knew it all
I'd seen all the signs before.
I thought that you were the one
In darkness my heart was won.

You build me up then you knock me down.
You play the fool while I play the clown.
We keep time to the beat of an old slave drum.
You raise my hopes then you raise the odds
You tell me that I dream too much
Now I'm serving time in a domestic graveyard.

I don't believe you anymore...I don't believe you.

Never let it be said I was untrue
I never found a home inside of you.
Never let it be said I was untrue
I gave you all my time.

// The Carnival Is Over //

Outside the storm clouds gathering
Moved silently along the dusty boulevard
Where flowers turning crane their fragile necks
So they can in turn reach up and kiss the sky

They're driven by a strange desire
Unseen by the human eye
Someone's calling

I remember when you held my hand
In the park we would play
When the circus came to town
Look over here

Outside the circus gathering
Moved silently along the rain swept boulevard
The procession moved on, the shouting is over
The fabulous freaks are leaving town

They're driven by a strange desire
Unseen by the human eye
Someone's calling

The carnival is over

We sat and watched
As the moon rose
For the very first time

// Tell Me About The Forest (You Once Called Home) //

Farewell now, my sister
Up ahead there lies your road
And your conscience walks beside you
It's the best friend you'll ever know

And the past is now your future
It bears witness to your soul
Make sure that the love you offer up
Does not fall on barren soil

For the wind cries of late
In the whispering grass
Our way of life is held
In the spinning wheels of chance

I believe
In the way of long ago
And the sands I believe
Rose long ago

And we're changing our ways
Yes, we're taking on different roads
Tell me more about the forest
That you once called home

For the wind cries of late
In the whispering leaves
And the sun will turn to waste
The heavens we built above

Father, teach your children
To treat our mother well
If we give her back her diamonds
She will offer up her pearl

We must sing her creation's song
Show them all
Invoke the spirits that feed us
This dreaming takes too long

But I'm not bitter
No, I'm surviving
To face the world
To raise the future

So why don't you tell me
Come on and tell me
About the world you left behind
Can you tell me?

Sota mono tratao no trateja mon
Uto traja satija totaja tom
Ima toja satao no trateja mon
Uto traja satija tom satija tom
Sadom sadom
Sadom sadom
Una torti sadom
Una parki sadom

Suta mono tratao na trateja ton
Uto traja satija totaja ton
Ima toja satao uno trateja ton
Uto traja satija tom satija tom
Sadom sadom
Sadom sadom
Una torti sadom
Una parki sadom

Suta mono tratao na trateja ton
Uto traja satija totaja ton
Ima toja satao no trateja ton
Uto traja satija tom satija tom
Sadom sadom
Sadom sadom
Una torti sadom
Una parki sadom

// How Fortunate The Man With None //

You saw sagacious Solomon
You know what came of him
To him complexities seemed plain
He cursed the hour that gave birth to him
And saw that everything was vain
How great and wise was Solomon
The world however didn't wait
But soon observed what followed on
It's wisdom that had brought him to this state
How fortunate the man with none
How fortunate the man with none

You saw courageous Caesar next
You know what he became
They deified him in his life
Then had him murdered just the same
And as they raised the fatal knife
How loud he cried: you too, my son
The world however didn't wait
But soon observed what followed on
It's courage that had brought him to that state
How fortunate the man with none
How fortunate the man with none

You heard of honest Socrates
The man who never lied
They weren't so grateful as you'd think
Instead the rulers fixed to have him tried
And handed him the poisoned drink
How honest was the people's noble son
The world however didn't wait
But soon observed what followed on
It's honesty that brought him to that state
How fortunate the man with none
How fortunate the man with none

Here you can see respectable folk
Keeping to God's own laws
So far he hasn't taken heed
You who sit safe and warm indoors
Help to relieve our bitter need
How virtuously we had begun
The world however didn't wait
But soon observed what followed on
It's fear of God that brought us to that state
How fortunate the man with none
How fortunate the man with none
