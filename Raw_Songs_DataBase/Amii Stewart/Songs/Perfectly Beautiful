Lift up my head
See better days

Looking back at all the good times
Simple songs full of bad rhymes
Locked in this prison of mine

Tied down to expectations
Fed up with deep frustrations
Best to leave the past behind

Lift up my head
See better days
The future is so bright
In so many ways
When I look in the mirror, what do I see?
The perfectly beautiful to me
Beautiful
The perfectly beautiful

Broken chains, broken every rule
An original, and nothing is taboo
I wanna share the me I long to be

But, will ya stand up beside me
When others cannot define me
I'm beautiful and I'm living free!

Yeah! yeah! yeah!
See better days
The future is so bright
In so many ways
When I look in the mirror, what do I see?
The perfectly beautiful to me
Hey, I'm beautiful
Hey yeah! Perfectly beautiful

Take my hand, let's take a stand
Raise your flag because you can
Look out world, cause here I am!

Lift up my head
See better days
The future is so bright
In so many ways
When I look in the mirror, what do I see?
The perfectly beautiful to me
Hey! I'm beautiful
Ooh, perfectly beautiful to me
