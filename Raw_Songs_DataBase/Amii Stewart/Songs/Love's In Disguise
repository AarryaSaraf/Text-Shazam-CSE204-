Something doesn't sign
There's a love is tryin' to hide
In between the vision and the dream
Feel my achin' heart, feel my wonder desires
These sensations play up on my skin
Love's in disguise, love's in disguise

Look into my eyes deeper than the diamond lights
Can't you see this love inside
Over love you meet, over dreams you see
All my love's between the lines
Love's in disguise

Oh, is it hard to recognize?
Oh, can't you see love's in disguise?

Walk to side on my cage, I'm lifted on the stage
Satisfaction guarantee
Love's a masquerade, love's a cool charade
Come on baby feed my needs
Love's in disguise, love's in disguise

Oh, is it hard to recognize?
Oh, can't you see love's in disguise?

Look into my eyes deeper than the diamond lights
Can't you see this love inside
Over love you meet, over dreams you see
All my love's between the lines
Love's in disguise...
