Where we walk, down the road, everyday
With a plastic smile and we wave like we're in a parade

Ooh, and then we pass one another
And nothing but a "how do you do"
Ooh, but it makes me smile
And we'd stop for awhile
And just give me the truth now

We can make it real
Open your heart
Cause that's when you start
To truly feel
We can make it real
Look in my eyes
You feel it inside
Yea, I know you will
We can make it real now
We can make it

Let your mind, take a walk, in the rain
Let you head roll back, touch the joy, remember the pain

Cause we can talk about the weather
We can weather it together my friend
And the sun will shine on your heart and mine
We will feel it again and again and again

We can make it real
Open your heart
Cause that's when you start
To truly feel
We can make it real
Look in my eyes
You'll feel it inside
Yea, I know you will
We can make it real, yes we can
No, we can make it real

This life that we're liven
It's all that we're given
It's all little precious time
But now it's the moment
Let your emotions breathe in the open sky
And fly...

We can make it real...

Cause that's when you start
To truly feel
We can make it real
Look in my eyes
You'll feel it inside
Yea, I know you will
We can make it real
...
