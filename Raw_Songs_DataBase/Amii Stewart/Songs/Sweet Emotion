Every star is out tonight
To light our love
So round the moon so full
And bright so high above
But if you look real closely
There's only me, there's only you
And when you hold me closely, oh-whoa

And now the sky melts in the sea
Like they are one
It's hard to tell where one thought starts
And where ends one
That's the way our love is
You part of me and me part of you
That's just what love is, oh-whoa

Sweet, you got the sweetest emotions
Sweet, sweet emotions
Sweet, you got the sweetest emotions
Sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet

You took me from the surface
To a deeper deep
Showing me that you
And you are life for me
Our love will last forever
Me loving you, you loving me
We'll always be together, whoa, yeah, yeah

Sweet, you got the sweetest emotions
Sweet, sweet emotions
Sweet, you got the sweetest emotions
Sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet

Sweet, you got the sweetest emotions
Sweet, sweet emotions
Sweet, you got the sweetest emotions
Sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet

Sweet, you got the sweetest emotions
Sweet, sweet emotions
Sweet, you got the sweetest emotions
