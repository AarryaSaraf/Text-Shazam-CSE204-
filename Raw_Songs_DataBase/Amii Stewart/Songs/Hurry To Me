Come on, hurry hurry hurry to me
You can share or tell your worries to me
Use my shoulder anytime
To laugh or cry on

When each day is over make your way to me
And don't let anything delay you
I will always be someone
You can rely on

Don't let's waste a precious little minute
Let's be sure to use each second
And in the end that way
To make the best of ev'ry day

Come on, hurry hurry hurry to me
You can share or tell your worries to me
Anywhere you are
I won't be far away

Hear my heart beating
Each beat keeps asking
You to stay near me
Can't your heart hear me?

Let love forever
Keep us together
Love where deep as mine
Is worth a lifetime
