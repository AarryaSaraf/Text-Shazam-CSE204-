Got a feelin' bein' born later
There's somethin' wrong, and I don't know what
I don't see the passion I used to see
Broken promises hangin' in the air
You don't care like you used to care
Before when you're lyin' here by me

Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm just goin' crazy
But cryin' lonely
I've got to know I'm the one you need
I'm talkin'
Lover to lover deep in the night
Heart to heart
Lover to lover, you know what's touch never lies

You belong to the cost of love
Imagination that won't give up
I give feeling, it's more than that you were bored
You never lie, you just leave up the truth
But one kiss cannot hide the proof
That's when you dream of the one you're dreamin' of

Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm just goin' crazy
But cryin' lonely
I've got to know I'm the one you need
I'm talkin'
Lover to lover deep in the night
Heart to heart
Lover to lover, you know what's touch never lies
One way or another
Holdin' on tight in the dark

You can use so many words to confuse me
But you'd better be ready to lose me
Forget the past that you play so well
A touch can tell lover to lover tonight

I'm talkin', I'm talkin'
Lover to lover deep in the night
Heart to heart
One way or another
Holdin' on tight in the dark
Lover to lover
Come on and tell me, tell me
Lover to lover deep in the night
Heart to heart
Lover to lover, you know what's touch never lies...
