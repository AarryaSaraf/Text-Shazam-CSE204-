I sit here on my own
Temptation is to fool
But I know that if I do
It'll come too

I found a compromise
No hang ups and no ties
But I'm only hiding
Behind laughter as disguise

Bring it on back to me
Heartaches and misery
Maybe I'll lose, but that's what I choose
So bring it on back to me

Bring it on back to me
Heartaches and misery
Maybe I'll lose, but that's what I choose
So bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Yeah

Your love left out and feels
As I hung on through the years
But who was I fooling
When I cried, "No more tears"

I found a compromise
No hang ups and no ties
But I'm only hiding
Behind laughter as disguise

Bring it on back to me
Heartaches and misery
Maybe I'll lose, but that's what I choose
So bring it on back to me

Bring it on back to me
Heartaches and misery
Maybe I'll lose, but that's what I choose
So bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me

Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
I want you just to bring it on back to me
Yeah, bring it on back to me
Bring it on back to me
Yeah, bring it on back to me
Won't you just bring it on back to me
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
Yeah, bring it on back to me
Yeah, bring it on back to me, yeah
