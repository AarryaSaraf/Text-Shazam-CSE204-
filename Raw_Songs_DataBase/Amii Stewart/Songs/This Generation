Awful century is not his problem
But he can try, other say it
Mothers and fathers, they built this country
We must've put them sub to share

But nowadays we're talking 'bout distraction
We've got to stand up
And make everybody say it
Nowadays we're talkin' 'bout pollution
We've got to stand up
And set this world free

This generation won't change the works right
This generation, we hold up to fight
This generation is gonna do
What the other generation didn't do
(This generation)
This generation will find solution
This generation will be in confusion
This generation is gonna do
What the other generation didn't do
We're singin'
Nanana di da...

When you look 'round you see
We've got problems
But we can try, other say it
What you get, it's all that
We can rule this country
We must've put them sub to share

But nowadays we're talking' 'bout distraction
We've got to stand up
And make everybody say it
Nowadays we're talkin' 'bout pollution
We've got to stand up
And set this world free

This generation won't change the works right
This generation, we hold up to fight
This generation is gonna do
What the other generation didn't do
(This generation)
This generation will find solution
This generation will be in confusion
This generation is gonna do
What the other generation didn't do
We're singin'
Nanana di da...

Stand up, stand up
Oh, stand up, stand up
Oh, stand up
