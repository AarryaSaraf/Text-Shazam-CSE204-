As I look into your eyes
I see the doubts and realize
You saw me with a friend we share
You take it as a love affair

You got a hold on me, a guarantee
I don't wanna lose you
But the more I'm free
The less I'd be likely to deceive you

Jealousy
Why are you (Jealousy) jealous of me?
(Jealousy) Is this how it's gonna be?
Jealousy

You may play this lover's game
Pretending that you feel no pain
Thinking that you're hurting me
But you're the casualty

You mean so much to me
I'm begging you to throw away

Your jealousy
Why are you (Jealousy) jealous of me?
(Jealousy) Is this how it's gonna be?
Jealousy

It's just a jealousy
Don't take your love from me
It's just a jealousy
Jealousy, jealousy

You got a hold on me
And it's a guarantee
It's just a jealousy
Jealousy, jealousy

It's just a jealousy
Don't take your love from me
It's just a jealousy
Jealousy, jealousy

You got a hold on me
And it's a guarantee
It's just a jealousy
Jealous, jealous, jealousy

But you're the casualty
You mean so much to me
I'm begging you to throw away

Your jealousy
Why are you (Jealousy) jealous of me?
(Jealousy), is this how it's gonna be?
Jealousy

If you read between the lines
Or question all my alibis
You may think you know it all
But who can tell when lovers fall?

You've got a hold on me
I'm begging you to throw away

Your jealousy
Why are you (Jealousy) jealous of me?
(Jealousy), is this how it's gonna be?

Oh jealousy
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's just a jealousy
Don't take your love from me

Jealousy, jealousy

You got a hold on me
And it's a guarantee
It's just a jealousy
Jealous, jealous, jealousy

(Jealousy) Our love is gone, our love is gone
Our love is gone, gone, gone, gone (Jealousy)

Our love is gone, gone, gone, gone (Jealousy)
