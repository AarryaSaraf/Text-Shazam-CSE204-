I know I was wrong
For leaving you by yourself
I said something's got a hold on me
And I lost control

But now I know where I belong (where I belong)
And I wanna come back home (wanna come back home)
I need your love
And, baby, I need it so bad

Here I stand with my heart in my hands (with my heart in my hands)
Don't make me feel any less than I am (any less than I am)
Don't make me crawl on my hands
Back to you

If I could only
Get your love back, I said, I said
If I could only
Get your love back

I know you wanna make me pay
For all the wrong that I've done
Well, baby, I'm ready (I'm ready)
I will pay you the price that you want

And I don't care what I have to do (what I have to do)
As long as I can be close to you (be close to you)
Your sweet love was the best love
That I ever had

Here I stand with the tears in my eyes (with the tears in my eyes)
I'm not ashamed to let you see me cry (let you see me cry)
To be without your love, I'd rather die
Baby, please hold me in your arms

If I could only
Get your love back, I said, I said
If I could only
Get your love back
I'll be so satisfied

Now I know where I belong (where I belong)
And I wanna come back home (wanna come back home)
I need your love
And, baby, I need it so bad

Here I stand with my heart in my hands (with my heart in my hands)
Don't make me feel any less than I am (any less than I am)
Don't make me crawl on my hands
Back to you, oh baby

If I could only
Get your love back, I said, I said
If I could only
Get your love back, oh baby

If I could only
Get your love back, I said, I said
If I could only
Get your love back
Get it back, get it back, get it back, get it back, get it back

If I could only, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just get your love back, baby
Just get your love back, baby
Just get your love back, baby
Just get your love back, baby

If I could only, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just get your love back, baby
Just get your love back, baby
If I could only, yeah, yeah
Baby
