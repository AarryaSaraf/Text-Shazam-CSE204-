Ooh, if your love is only me
I'll never give that guarantee
You got it all wrong if you think I belong to you
That doesn't mean that I would say I wasn't fond of you

Love is the fool who tried in vain
(If your love, if your love is only me)
Who suffered time and time again
(If your love, if your love is only me)
Just because I said that I would spend the night with you
That doesn't mean that I would say I was in love with you

(Step into the love line)
Step into the love line
(Hold on to the love sign)
Hold on to the love sign
(Step into the love line)
Step into the love line
(Hold on to the love sign)
(Step into the love line)
Step, step
Hold on to the love sign

Love is the fire that feeds the flame
(If your love, if your love is only me)
I touched the fire and felt the pain
(If your love, if your love is only me)

You got it all wrong if you think I belong to you
Doesn't mean that I would say I wasn't fond of you

(Step into the love line)
Step into the love line
(Hold on to the love sign)
Hold on to the love sign
(Step into the love line)
Step into the love line
(Hold on to the love sign)
Hold on, hold on
(Step into the love line)
Hold on to the love sign

(If your love, if your love is only me)
(If your love, if your love, if your love is only me)
If your love
(If your love, if your love is only me)
(If your love, if your love, if your love is only me)
(If your love, if your love is only me)
(If your love, if your love, if your love is only me)
If your love is only me
(If your love, if your love is only me)
(If your love, if your love, if your love is only me)

(Step into the love line)
Step into the love line
(Hold on to the love sign)
Hold on to the love sign
(Step into the love line)
Step, step into the love line
(Hold on to the love sign)

Step into the love line
(Step into the love line)
Step into the love line
(Hold on to the love sign)
Hold on to the love sign
