Beside you on the street last Saturday night
And my heart lived out of time
I said to myself right then and there
"Boy, I'm gonna make you mine"
Tired to get a whole of your telephone number
Tired to get your home address
Asked everybody in the neighborhood
But the game was out of success

(Conspiracy, save all your love for me)
(Conspiracy, I'm in love baby, can't you see)
(Conspiracy, save all your love for me)
(Conspiracy, I'm in love baby, can't you see)

Nothin' in the world could stop me now
I'll use every trick in the book
I'll think of a skin of master playin'
Just to get you in the hook
I'll be sweet mood, tenderly taffy
And the thing that I can find
And the physical seduction doesn't work
I'll do shoot with my mind

(Conspiracy, save all your love for me)
(Conspiracy, I'm in love baby, can't you see)
(Conspiracy, save all your love for me)
(Conspiracy, I'm in love baby, can't you see)
(Conspiracy, save all your love for me)
(Conspiracy, I'm in love baby, can't you see)

It seems like rendez-vous
I wanna spend my night with you
It seems like rendez-vous
Nobody does but we're gonna do
It seems like rendez-vous
I wanna spend my night with you
It seems like rendez-vous
Nobody does but we're gonna do (nobody does but we're gonna do)

(Conspiracy, save all your love for me)
(Conspiracy, I'm in love baby, can't you see)
(Conspiracy, save all your love for me)
(Conspiracy, I'm in love baby, can't you see)
(Conspiracy, save all your love for me)
(Conspiracy, I'm in love baby, can't you see)

(Conspiracy)...
