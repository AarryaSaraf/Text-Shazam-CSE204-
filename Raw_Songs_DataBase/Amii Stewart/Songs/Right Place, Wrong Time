I'm at the right place at the wrong time
Guess I made it too late and you're no longer mine
You met a fool with money and you fell away
Is it cruel to remind you that you should've stayed?

Don't wanna say hello
But I sure would like to know what happened to ya?
Sip on a julip, their playin' our music
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I gave you love
But it wasn't good enough, you were ambitious
So dedicated
You should have waited

You're at the right place at the wrong time
Guess I made it too late and you're no longer mine
You met a fool with money and you fell away
Is it cruel to remind you that you should've stayed?
(You should've stayed, you should've stayed)

Nobody understood
Why we always knock on wood when a love please us
So superstitious
We play to our wishes
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I gave you love, oh
I gave you love

So dedicated
You should've waited

We're at the right place at the wrong time
Guess I made it too late and you're no longer mine
You met a fool with money and you fell away
Is it cruel to remind you that you should've stayed?
(You should've stayed, you should've stayed)

We're at the right place at the wrong time
I guess I made it too late and you're no longer mine
You met a fool with money and you fell away
Is it cruel to remind you...

Don't wanna say hello
But I sure would like to know what happened to ya?
Sip on a julip, their playin' our music
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I gave you love
But it wasn't good enough
So dedicated
You should have waited

We're at the right place at the wrong time
I guess I made it too late and you're no longer mine
You met a fool with money and you fell away
Is it cruel to remind you that you should've stayed?
(You should've stayed, you should've stayed)

We're at the right place at the wrong time
I guess I made it too late and you're no longer mine
You met a fool with money and you fell away
Is it cruel to remind you...

We're at the right place
(At the wrong time)
At the wrong time

(You should've stayed, you should've stayed, you should've stayed)
