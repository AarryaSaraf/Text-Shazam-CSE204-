Do you ever need someone to hold at night?
Did music ever fill your soul?
My spinning mind just knows that's right
Did you ever dream of lovin' at first sight?

You are the closest thing to heaven I know
The greatest thing that happened to my life
And no one else could ever go
To the closest thing to heaven that I know

And wiser men in love have walked away
But are you strong enough to stay?
A fool in love will walk his way
Could we ever stop to think for just today?

You are the closest thing to heaven I know
The greatest thing that happened to my life
And no one else could ever go
To the closest thing to heaven that I know

Put your head on my shoulder
Let me feel your emotions
You know you're the one I love (you're the one I love)
Clouds disappear, the sun's gettin' near
You're the only one I'm thinking of

You are the closest thing
The closest thing to heaven
The greatest thing that happened to my life
And no one, no one could ever go
To the closest thing to heaven that I know

The closest thing to heaven
The greatest thing that happened to my life
And no one, no one could ever go
To the closest thing to heaven that I know
