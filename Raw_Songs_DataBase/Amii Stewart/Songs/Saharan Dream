Ooh, to dream a dream or two
Ooh, and to believe in you

Saharan winds to bring me wings to fly
So far away so far so high
Saharan mystery
Will charm the words
That mark the history
Of wars and world

I'll cross the night
And come to you
You'll take me to heights
Beyond the blue
The blue of a sweet Saharan dream

Ooh, so far across the dune
Ooh, Saharan dream of you
