Carry on bear the heavy load on a dusty road
Got to win the race
Even though the road is hard
Got to be certain
Like the blackbird flying in the night
What it's doing here
Searching for the way
Even though the road is hard
Got to be certain

It's a typical dream that's never ending
Burning inside of us all
Gotta follow the stream
And watch it bending

In my dark years
Don't you stray away from the dusty road
Keep your own two feet
Even though the road is hard
Got to be certain
Lots of people are going to put you down
But does it bother you?
Don't let them change your mind, oh no
Even though the road is hard
Got to be certain

It's a typical dream that's never ending
Burning inside of us all
Gotta follow the stream
And watch it bending
Oh, typical dream that's never ending
Burning inside of us all
Gotta follow the stream

And keep your feelings on the move
When you know the fight is over
And you can tell them all
If you wanna get where you're going
Don't get lost on the road

Steppin' down, movin' right along
Loneliness forgotten, don't get lost on the road
