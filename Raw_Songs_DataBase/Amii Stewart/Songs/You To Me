Our love is an endless river
Keeps on flowing on and on forever
Each dream like a forest flower
Keeps on growing every hour

We can almost touch the horizon's edge
So reaching further
Then we can even light up the star ahead
I know we were bound by destiny
We will always be

You to me are everything
You to me are everything
My whole world's devoted to you
For you there's not a thing I wouldn't do
You to me are everything

Our love is a perfect circle
Has no start or end, cannot be broken
Stronger than a moment's weakness
It knows no secrets, we both believe it

No one's ever gonna come between
The love we're sharing
And no one's gonna take away our dream
'Cause there's more than words could ever say
How can I explain?

You to me are everything
You to me are everything
My whole world's devoted to you
For you there's not a thing I wouldn't do
You to me are everything

You to me are everything
You to me are everything
Oh, baby, you to me are everything
You to me are everything, baby

You to me are everything
You to me are everything
Oh, baby, you to me are everything
You to me are everything
Oh, baby, you to me are everything
