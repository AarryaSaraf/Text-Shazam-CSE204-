I'll never find the words to tell you
I never find the words to say
I never thought I'd feel the way I'm feeling now
When I look at you it's all the way

With you now I've come so far
Changed my way of living
Made the bad times, good times once again
Now I'm free from the crazy years
Living through so many changes
The loneliness and tears

It's you and me, now I see
I couldn't make it through the day without you
It's you and me and I never mean to hide
The way I feel inside now can't you see
That it's you and me

This world keeps spinning round through time
And you say I run too fast
Caught up in the future
Take for granted love will always last
Baby please
I've waited far too long
Never cared about tomorrow
Until you came along

It's you and me
Take a look and see
I couldn't make it through the day without you
It's you and me and I never mean to hide
It's just my foolish pride now can't you see
That it's you and me

People smile they love to call you friend
But darling in the end
The heart goes some place else
Searching for that someone goes on and on
In search of love

Said it's you and me and I never mean to hide
The way I feel inside now can't you see
That it's you and me
