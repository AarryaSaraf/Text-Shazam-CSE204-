Wake up to the sound of music
Tune it to my head
Tender darlin' found the coolest groove
I hit the streets to the ghetto beat
Baby, check out on my moods
Hypnotize you with my dancing' shoes

Mr DJ's got me eatin' out of his hands
Got me hoppin, got me poppin'
Master's voice in command
Mr DJ's got me eatin' out of his hands
Got me hoppin, got me poppin'
Master's voice in command

Power play, power play
Power play, power play
Power play, power play, power play
Power play

When the world goes stuck in heavy
You won't see me cry
'Cause I've got my music
Jumpin' by my side
You can beat it, you can cheat it
But you won't see me the blues
The air is always got me satisfied

Cause Mr DJ's got me eatin' out of his hands
Got me hoppin, got me poppin'
Master's voice in command
Mr DJ's got me eatin' out of his hands
Got me hoppin, got me poppin'
Master's voice in command

Power play, power play
Power play, power play
Power play, power play, power play
Power play...
