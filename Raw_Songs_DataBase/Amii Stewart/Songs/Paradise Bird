Paradise bird, fly away

What have I gotta do
To keep a hold on you?
Don't ever let me tie you down
I know you've gotta choose, why don't you?
And if you have to go, let's break up now

Maybe I can understand
Why you're acting underhand
Sometimes I ask too much of you
I don't want you to go, but I know
You've found a horizon calling out to you

Paradise bird, fly away
Fly away
Paradise bird, fly away

Seems like only yesterday
You were begging me to stay
You tried so hard to change my mind
Funny how the tables turned round and around
Paradise bird, you're hard to find

Paradise bird, you're hard to find
Paradise bird, you're hard to find
Fly away, fly away

Paradise bird, so far away
Paradise bird

Seems like only yesterday
You were begging me to stay
You tried so hard to change my mind
Funny how the tables turned
Round and around
Paradise bird, you're hard to find

Paradise bird, so hard to find
Paradise, you're hard to find

Fly away, fly away
Fly, fly
Oh, fly away
Fly away, fly away
Fly away, fly away
Fly away, fly away
