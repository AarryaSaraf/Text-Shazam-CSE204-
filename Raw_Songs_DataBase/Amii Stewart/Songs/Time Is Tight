Down the open highway
Time just fades away
Colours paint the sky
As all friends fade to gray
No one sees the hours
They just count the years
When the thunder fills the sky
There'll be no tears

Time is tight
Mine tonight
Play the cards
Time is tight
Mine tonight
Shoot the stars
Ooh, dance when the music's right
Ooh, don't ever say goodnight

Down the open highway
Time just fades away
Colours paint the sky
As all friends fade to gray
No one sees the hours
They just count the years
When the thunder fills the sky
There'll be no tears

Time is tight
Mine tonight
Play the cards
Time is tight
Mine tonight
Shoot the stars
Ooh, dance when the music's right
Ooh, don't ever say goodnight

Time is tight
Mine tonight
Play the cards
Time is tight
Mine tonight
Shoot the stars
Ooh, dance when the music's right
Ooh, don't ever say goodnight

Time is tight
Mine tonight
Play the cards
Time is tight
Mine tonight
Shoot the stars
Ooh, dance when the music's right
Ooh, don't ever say goodnight

Time is tight!
