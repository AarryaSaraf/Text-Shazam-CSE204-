Nothing you could say could
Tear me away from my guy
Nothing you could do cause
I'm stuck like glue to my guy

I'm sticking to my guy
Like a stamp to a letter
Birds of a feather
We stick together

There is nothing you could do
To make me untrue
Nothing you could do could
Make me untrue to my guy

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
Now when it's cold outside
I've got the month of May

Well, I guess you could say
What could make me feel this way
My girl, I'm talking bout my girl

I've got sunshine (I've got sunshine)
On a cloudy day (on a cloudy day)
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May
(Merry month of May)

Well, I guess you could say
What could make me feel this way
My girl (my guy) I'm talking
Bout my girl (my guy)
Oh, whoa, my girl (my guy)

There's nothing you could do
To make me untrue
Nothing you could do to make me
Untrue to my guy (my girl)

Nothing you could do to make me
Untrue to my guy (my girl)
Nothing you could buy could
Make me tell lies to my guy (my girl)

I'm sticking to my guy
Like a stamp to a letter
Birds of a feather
We stick together

There is nothing you could do
To make me untrue
Nothing you could do could
Make me untrue to my guy
(My girl, little baby) my guy
(She brings me sunshine)

There's nothing you could do
To make me untrue
Nothing you could do could
Make me untrue to my guy
(Would you lie to me, baby)
My guy (she's so good to me)

Nothing you could do
To make me untrue
Nothing you could do could
Make me untrue to my guy

Gonna stay true to me, baby
Gonna stay true, gonna stay true

There's nothing you could do
To make me untrue
Nothing you could do could
Make me untrue to my guy...
