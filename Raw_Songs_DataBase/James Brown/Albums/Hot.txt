// Please, Please, Please //

You know... former shoeshine boy from a very, very poor family
My father, that worked hard all his life
And we "moved from pillar to post", is what the people used to say
Never really had home
I can... as far back as I can remember, it was always renting
Paying another cash bills, and never really paying home
And this is a... tune, I guess probably mean more to me
Than anything, that uh... I've ever been involved in
And I figured that I should come back and really, really sing it
With all the success I've had, and as good as people have been to me
I wanna show them, that I still have
My real heart, my real soul, my real feelin'
But when you start doing things with people, you um...
Hesitance to keep it up and, and love what you're doing
Because you know you're doing something good, to say
As God looked down on you and smiled
And uh... I always look back and say, you know
"I've done something good"
So I wanna get the fellas started off here...
That, and all the fellas in that control room
And it makes me feel good, start it off fellas, kick it off

(Please, please, don't go)
Please, please, please
(Please, please, don't go)
Honey please, don't go
(Ohhh...) Girl, girl, I love you so
(Please, please, don't go) Lord, have mercy

Baby, you've done me wrong
(Please, please, don't go)
Baby, baby baby baby
You've done me wrong
(Please, please, don't go)
You know you've done, done me wrong
(Ohhh...) Oh, oh yeah
Took my love, and now you're gone
(Please, please, don't go)

Wanna stand up and sing it, like I used to sing it
But I just wanna hear you say:
I (I), I (I), I (I), oh I (I)
I (I), I (I), oh I (I), honey please (I)
Please (ohhh...) oh Lord, baby

Take my hand

I wanna sing it for the people from Georgia
People of New York, all of my brothers and sisters
Don't go (ohhh...) oh, oh yeah
I love you so
(Please, please, don't go)
I wanna dedicate this especially to
My son [?], who's gone home, Teddy Brown
I just wanna say it one more time...

// So Long //

So long, hope we'll meet again some day
Hope that maybe then you'll say
"Darling, I was wrong"

So long, gee, I hate to see you go
You're the world to me you know
You've been mine, so long

All alone with my memories of you
I can see that you're lonely too
You're my own, even though we're far apart
I will keep you right here in my heart

So long, so long
Though you leave me here to cry
This can never ever be goodbye
We'll just say, so long

Though you leave me here to cry
This can never ever be goodbye
We'll just say, so long

// (I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons //

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I'll give you my heart

I love you, and you alone were meant for me
Please, give your loving heart to me
And say we'll never part

I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling, I'm never lonely
Whenever you are in sight

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart

// Hot (I Need To Be Loved, Loved, Loved, Loved) //

This morning I woke up all in heat
Couldn't find no dry spot from my head down to my feet
Got gaspin' and coughin' 'til my body began to sweat
Couldn't find no comfort, torn with hell and fret
I start thinking about the sweet soul sexy body
And my body begin to feel
Couldn't forget the way you made my body shiver
And the cold sweat make me quiver
Girl, I need to talk to you
Girl, I need to be with you
Girl, I need to squeeze you
I need to squeeze you

Girl, I need you, OW!
So good (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin')
Said I touch you with the power in my hand
Then I'll know you've been touched by a desperate man
Then I'll make you glad about the day and time that you were born
Then let you know can't sleep 'til your body moan
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin')

Ha, I need to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I need to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I wanna be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I need to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I wanna be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I need to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I wanna be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

Make me feel good when you say the sweetest man alive
Ooh, feel me, count, 1 2 3 4 5
Ah, ha, hahaha
Ah-ha, ah-hahaha
Oh, oh (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin')
Got gaspin' and coughin', and my body began to sweat
Couldn't find no comfort, dealing with hell and fret
Then I start thinking about your sweet so sexy body
And then my body began to build
Couldn't forget the way you made my body shiver
The cold sweat make me quiver
Really need to talk to you
Really need to be with you
Really need to squeeze you
Ah, I could please you, please you
OW! (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin')
Ah (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin')
WHOA! (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin')
OH!

Said I need to touch ya with the power in my hand
And let you know you've been touched by a desperate man
Then I'll make you glad about the time that you were born
Make you cough and sweat, make your body moan...
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin')
(Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin')
Hit me! OW! (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin')

Ah, I need to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I wanna be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I need to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I wanna be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
Got to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I wanna be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I wanna be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I need to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
Got to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I wanna be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
I need to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
Got to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

// Most Of All //

You know, Bobby Byrd, one of the Famous Flames, [?] he is
In fact, everybody, we got the whole First Family in here tonight
Everybody's reminiscing, singing 'bout beautiful things
And the Famous Flames are gonna be doing some thing behind colors [?]
Hey, we got a new bag be coming out - but dig this one

Most of all, I want your warm embrace
No one can take your place
I need you most of all, heh
Most of all, I want your sweet caress
Truly, I must confess
I need you, most of all... sure sounds good

When I sleep at night
I dream wonderful, wonderful dreams of you
And when I awake
No one's there and then
Why I'm so blue?

Most of all, I want that one thing I miss
The way we used to kiss
I need you most of all, most of all

When I sleep at night
I dream wonderful, wonderful dreams of you
And when I awake
No one's there and then, heh
Why I'm so blue?

Most of all, the one thing that I miss
The way we used to kiss, mhm, mhm
I need you most of... uhh... all...!

Goodnight, my love
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me

Before you go
There's one thing I'd like to know
Please remember that I need you so
And this love will never grow cold

Oh, if you should awake (Awake)
In the still of the night (The night)
Please have no fear
I'll be there, you know I care
Please bring your love to, to me

Before you go
There's just one thing I'd like to know
Please bring your love to me

If you should awake (Awake)
In the still of the night (The night)
Please have no fear
Oh, I'll be there, you know I care
Please bring your love to, to me

Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go

I hate to leave you
But I really must say goodnight, sweetheart
Mmm, good night tonight, good night tonight
Goodnight, sweetheart
Goodnight, sweetheart
Goodnight, sweetheart
Nothing like the good oldies
Always say it right here, still good
Goodnight, sweetheart
So Fred, Bobby, yeah, I got you, brother man
What was you doing when this song came out?
The young fellas don't know what's happening but it's still good
And you, too, sister, you fine little foxy devil you
Goodnight, sweetheart, well, it's time to go
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
