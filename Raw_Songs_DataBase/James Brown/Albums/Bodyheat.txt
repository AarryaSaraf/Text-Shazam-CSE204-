// Woman //

(I'm a woman)
I'm a man
(I'm a woman)
I'm a man

What makes a man break up inside?
And what makes a man give up his pride?
What makes a man feel he's begun to fail?
And when he can't win he thinks he even can't tell me

(A woman)
Say it again
(A woman)
Say it again
(A woman)
I ask you

What makes men jealous of each other?
So tacturned against his brother, now here's the reason
She makes a cloudy day seem bright
She makes a nightmare turn into the warmest night

You know, she makes trouble seem so, so
She can turn a hardship and she makes it so easy to cross
She brings life into the world over and over again
No man in the world could ever bear those pains

She never lets you know when se feels bad
And she smiles when she feels sad
And when you and when you feel blue
She know her place right beside you

Right beside you and I wanna know
What makes a man stop tiring?
And who's the only one
Can stop a baby from crying?

// Bodyheat //

Yeah
(Body heat)
Yeah
(Yeah)

When your body get funky big time
And you need some love from fascination

What's that
(Body heat)
What's that
(Body heat)

When your body don't do what you want it to
And you don't do it because you know you're through

What's that
(Body heat)
What's that
(Body heat)

When you can't get your body please
And you need some love for your tension easer

What's that
(Body heat)
What's that
(Body heat)
Ah, payback

Got to go to church, you all[x4]

You got to turn on the heat, take off that dress
Put on the heat, take off that dress
Turn on the heat, take off that dress
Turn on the heat, give me some air
Can't go nowhere, I'm having bad luck
I'm having bad luck, I'm having bad luck
Got to release the [?]
I'm having bad luck, I'm having bad luck

Got to go to church, you all
Got to go to church, you all
Take me

When I was a little boy about the age of one
My mother told mem, "You loving son of a gun"
When I was a little boy about the age of two
Knew what I had to do
When I was a little boy about the age of three
Don't want nobody bothering me
When I was a little boy about the age of four
Back up, had to take it myself, gonna give me some more
When I was a little boy about the age of ten
About to catch myself, I want to do it again
When I was a little boy about age eleven
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Growing up, turn up the heat
Take off that dress

Better go to church, you all
Better go to church, you all
[?]

Give my loving

I want to give it up

I want to give it up 
I want to give it up

(Body heat, body heat)
Yeah
(Yeah)

// Kiss In '77 //

I know you're sick and tired, baby
Of the old things that I do
In 1975, I tried to love you
In the only way that I knew
But when I woke up this morning, I finally realized
That you needed something new to keep me satisfied

Got a new kiss for you, baby
In this year of '77
Baby, got a new kiss for you, sugar
It'll take you straight on into Heaven

I know, I know, I know that life has been miserable for you, sugar
In this past year or two, in a year or two
But I would never, never, never, never, never, never neglect you
I just didn't know what to do
But when I woke up this morning and finally realized
That you needed something new to keep you, oh, by my side

Got a new kiss for you, sugar
A brand new kiss
Mmm, got a new kiss for you, sugar
Cheek to cheek, toe to toe
Got a new kiss for you, baby
It'll last forever, forever, forever
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
New kiss for you, darlin'
It'll last, it'll last, always, forever
Got a new kiss, baby, baby, baby baby baby
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my darling
Oh, got a new kiss for you, baby
It's all, it's all, it's all that I need for you

// What The World Needs Now Is Love //

What the world needs now is love, sweet love
That's the only thing in my opinion it's not enough of
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
That's the only thing we don't have enough of

Ah, Lord, we don't need another mountain
There are mountains and hillsides enough to climb
There are oceans, rivers enough to cross
And last 'til the end of time... yeah

Oh, what the world needs now is love, sweet love
That's the only thing... play it! We don't have enough of
What the world needs now is just a lil' bit of love
That's the only thing, that we just don't have enough of

Ah, Lord, we don't need another mountain
There are mountains and hillsides enough to climb
There are oceans and rivers enough to cross
Enough, 'til... last 'til the end of time, ah, sing it

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ha-ha
'Til the end of time, sing it

What the world needs now - so-oh-oh, so much love
That's the only thing we just don't have enough of
Dr. King wanted love, John F. Kennedy wanted love
Robert Kennedy wanted love, you and I want...
Oh, oh, waaaoow... Lord, have mercy
We need a little bit of love
Love your children, love one another...

// Wake Up And Give Yourself A Chance To Live //

I know sometimes, during the hassles of the day
You feel that "What the heck? The harder I try, the rougher it get hit"
And when you do everything you can to make evrything be alright
And meet your bills, you understand, and your loved one seems to thank you like:
"Hey, you're not trying, you could do a little bit better"
Nobody understands where you're coming from, you say to yourself:
"Hey, I gotta prove it to me 'cause I know where I'm at"
And this is what you do

I know sometimes you feel the world has turned its back on you
But don't give up, it'll come through for you
So wake up, baby
Wake up, baby
Give yourself a chance
You owe that to yourself
So wake up, baby, give yourself a chance to live

This morning I got up, heh, feeling kinda down
But I say that's always the way
If you get yourself up off the ground
Let me wake up
And give myself a chance
I've got to wake right up
Wake right up and give yourself a chance to live

I know you're just human
And sometimes it can be a sho'nuff ruin
But when the feeling's too hard
Just take it to the Supreme
Force, and that's God
Wake up, baby
I've got to wake on up
Everybody needs to wake right up
Give yourself a chance to live
It's all there for you just go and get it
Wake on up
You owe it to yourself and no one else
