Album: SayItLoudImBlackAndImProud

// Say It Loud - I'm Black And I'm Proud //

Uh, with your bad self 
Say it louder (I got a mouth) 
Say it louder (I got a mouth) 

Look a'here, some people say we got a lot of malice 
Some say it's a lotta nerve 
I say we won't quit moving 
Til we get what we deserve 
We've been buked and we've been scourned 
We've been treated bad, talked about 
As just as sure as you're born 
But just as sure as it take 
Two eyes to make a pair, huh 
Brother, we can't quit until we get our share 

Say it loud, 
I'm black and I'm proud 
Say it loud, 
I'm black and I'm proud, one more time 
Say it loud, 
I'm black and I'm proud, huh 

I've worked on jobs with my feet and my hands 
But all the work I did was for the other man 
And now we demands a chance 
To do things for ourselves 
we tired of beating our heads against the wall 
And working for someone else 

Say it loud, 
I'm black and I'm proud 
Say it loud, 
I'm black and I'm proud

Ooowee uh, you're killing me, oow 

Say it loud, 
I'm black and I'm proud 
Say it louder, 
I'm black and I'm proud 

Now we demand a chance to do things for ourselves 
We tired of beating our heads against the wall 
And working for someone else 
A look a'here, 
One thing more I got to say right here 
Now, we're people like the birds and the bees 
We rather die on our feet, 
Than keep living on our knees 

Say it loud, 
I'm black and I'm proud, hu 
Say it loud, 
I'm black and I'm proud, hu 
Say it loud, 
I'm black and I'm proud, Lord'a Lord'a Lord'a 
Say it loud, 
I'm black and I'm proud, ooooh 

Uh, alright now, good Lord 
You know we can do the boog-a-loo 
Now we can say we do the Funky Broadway! 
Now we can do, hu 
Sometimes we dance, we sing and we talk 
You know I do like to do the camel walk 
Alright now, hu alright, 
Alright now, ha

// I Guess I'll Have To Cry Cry Cry //

My cup is running over
I don't know what to do
My cup is running over
I don't know what to do
No, I don't know
No, I don't know

Guess I gotta cry, cry, cry
People, let me cry, cry, cry
I'd feel a little bit better
If I cry, cry, cry

My cup is overflowing
I don't know what to do
My cup is overflowing
I don't know what to do
No, I don't know
No, I don't know

When I, I lost you
I lost the best thing I ever had
Now that I, I realize, oh
It makes me, it makes me
It makes me so bad

My cup is running over
I don't know what to do
My cup is running over
I don't know what to do
No, I don't know
No, I don't know

Just let me cry, people
How do you feel
How do you feel
When you see a man cry

People, let me cry
I'm not ashamed
I'm not ashamed
Guess I gotta walk away now
Just let me walk away
Just let me walk away
Just let me walk away

// Licking Stick, Pt. 1 //

Mama, come here quick
Bring me that licking stick [x4]

People standing
Standing in a trance
Sister out in the backyard
Doing the outside dance
Come and tell me you love me
She didn't wanna be a drag
I don't know what she's doing
I think she's got a brand new bag

Mama, come here quick
Bring me that licking stick [x2]

People standing
Standing in a trance
Sister out in the backyard
Doing the outside dance
Come and tell me you love me
She didn't wanna be a drag
I don't know what she's doing
I think she's got a brand new bag

Mama, come here quick
Bring me that licking stick [x4]

// I Love You //

I love you; yes, I do
I love you; yes, I do
I'm yours my whole life through
Since I first laid eyes on you

You love me; yes, you do
You need me, I need you
I'm yours my whole life through
I love you; yes, I do

I guess you knew it from the start
From the day you took my heart
You're the one girl I'll always admire

Darling, you're my guiding star
I must be forever where you are
You set my world on fire

I love you; yes, I do
I need you; yes, I do
I'm yours my whole life through
Since I first laid eyes on you

I know you know it's true
I love you; yes, I do
I love you; yes, I do

// Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye //

Don't play that song no more, don't play it
Kiss me each morning for a million years
Hold me each evening at your side
Oh darling, tell me you love me for a million years
If it don't work out—do you hear me?'
If it don't work out, then you can tell me goodbye
Oh now, hit me now

Sweeten my coffee with a morning, a morning kiss
Sop up my dream with a side, oh darlin'
Tell me you love me for a million years, oh now now
If it don't work out
If it don't work out, then you can tell me goodbye
Oh now, hey brother...
Play it, brother—play the song!
No, no, not that, no, no
Don't play it no more, brother
I can't stand it, I can't stand it
Don't play that song about goodbye
I can't stand it now, I can't stand it
You hit me, you hit me so hard, oh
If you must go, oh no, I won't peep
If you must wait a lifetime before you leave
If you must go, I won't tell you, oh no no no no no no no
I'll just say, say we tried, say we tried, we tried
Tell me you love me for a million, a million long years
And if it don't work, do you believe we can make it?
Don't play that song no more, can't stand it
I said, you hit me so low
I can't stand it, baby
I can't stand it now
I just can't stand it, ow, no no no
I can't stand it, I can't take no more
Don't play the song
Don't play the song, oh
Then you can tell me goodbye

// Let Them Talk //

Let them talk if they want to
Talk don't bother me
I want the whole wide world to know
That I love you so

Let them whisper, for they know not what
Between you and I
I'll keep on loving you
Until the day I die

They're trying to break up our romance
But they don't have, they don't have a chance
We have the kind of love that was so strong
And we'll be together from now on, oh
I know that gossip comes from the devil's workshop
But true love will make it stop
I want the whole wide world to know
That I love you so

They're trying to break up our romance, darling
They don't stand a possible chance
We have the kind of love that was strong
And we'll be together from now on, oh

Let them talk, let them tell everybody, I don't care
Let them talk, let them tell everybody
Hit me now, hit me

Don't bother me, oh, oh no
Oh, let them tell everybody
Sometime, sometime, they just don't
They just don't, they just don't understand now
But come on, hit me now, hit me
Oh baby, I wanna feel, I wanna feel
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Hit me now
Let them talk, let them talk
Let them talk, let them talk
Hit me now, hit me, baby
Oh, I just know, I just know
I don't understand it...

// Maybe I'll Understand //

I'm brokenhearted, it's my fault
Treated my baby wrong, and I just got to talk
But help me, somebody, I'm a man
Help me, somebody, I believe she just don't understand
I'm trying so hard, trying so hard
I'm trying to do the best I can, oh yes I am

When I, I lay down
I got my baby on my mind, oh yes I have
When I, when I lay down
I got my baby on my mind, oh yeah
I'll think about the good things, and the good times
The way she make me feel so fine

Mmm, I said I'm sitting in the dark, oh now
And I don't, I don't need no light
Oh yes I am, oh yes I am, yes I...
I'm sitting alone in the dark
I want the world to know I don't need no light
I need no light
'Cause I'm wondering, I'm wondering where she's gone
And I'm wondering what, what she's doing tonight
And all I can say, all I can say is
Help me, somebody, help me understand
Help me, somebody, I know that I'm not her man
'Cause I need her, to hold my hand
Then maybe, maybe I'll understand

That's the reason she wanted me for her part-time love now
She says, "Baby, baby, you don't understand"
AND OH, baby, I swear I just can't be
I can't be, I can't be your back-door man now, oh, no, I can't
I said, I said I just can't be
I said I can't be your back-door man, oh no I won't
I won't sneak and hide, baby
I'm a fool, people say, I just don't understand, oh no, oh no
Play it one time, Jimmy, oh now

[Jimmy Nolen guitar solo]

Take it down some
Can't lose these blues
Mmm...can't lose these blues
I remember, I remember, my grandma told me one time
She said it's so hard, when you're trying to play a Blackjack game
Oh yes it is
I had 15, hit him with a 6
You know, you know, you know he wasn't just the same
Ain't that a sin?
If I could've hit that 15 I had
Do you know that would make me win?
I guess I'm, I guess I'm, I'm in hard luck
And OH, and OH...help me, somebody, hey
Help me, somebody, OH, help me, somebody
Help me, somebody, OH...
