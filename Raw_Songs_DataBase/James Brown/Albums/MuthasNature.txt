// Have A Happy Day //

Have a happy day

If you see my baby
Tell her that I'm back in town
Tell her that I really miss her
And I didn't mean to put her down
I'd run around all over town
And it broke her heart in two
But now, I'm down on my knees, baby
Even though I know we're through
I still want you to, yeah yeah

Have a happy day
Hope love comes your way
Look here, baby
Now and forever
Baby
Have a happy day
Hope love comes your way
Now and forever
One more, one more time, baby

I apologize for being so hard-headed, baby
And I'm sorry for telling you those lies
I know you would never let me come back, sugar sugar
Because of the way I hurt you inside, heh

Now I've grown a little wiser, dear
And I realize I was such a drag
Please think, think of the good things, oh na na na na
From in the future, and forget about the past heartbreaking past
Oh baby

Have a happy day
Hope loves comes your way
Now and forever
Think about the good things, baby
Baby, when I had my thing
Have a happy day
Hope love comes your way
Now and forever
Baby
Have a happy day
Hope love comes your way
Now and forever
Forever, forever, WOO
Have a happy day
Hope love comes your way
Now and forever
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Have a happy day
Hope love comes your way
Now and forever

// Summertime //

You know, Martha, I'm just so disgusted
Because Mother Nature didn't intend for the things that are happening
To happen to us like it's happening
I don't believe that God intended for us to destroy so many beautiful things
And take away the beauty that he bestowed upon us
You're right, James
But it's a shame the way poverty is on a run, pollution
All the destructions that's happening
And the war of the world
That's right
When the world began, it wasn't supposed to be this way
I'm so sure it wasn't
And I feel that we can find a way together
You're my beautiful sister and I love you, and this is my sister
And Martha
I've been with you for a long time, you've seen me grow up
I'm a woman
God bless you

And I just wanna say, summertime
And the living is easy, yeah
Ah, the fish are jumpin', yeah
Not like they used to, yeah yeah
I don't see the cotton grow very high
Oh, oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah
My old daddy ain't rich
Thank God, my my my my mammy is still good lookin', yeah yeah yeah
Hidden from her roots
So I wanna tell you out there
Hush you and you and you, and especially that little baby, yeah yeah yeah
Don't you cry
I don't care whether you're white, black, blue or green, yellow, red, purple or orange
Don't you cry, God is gonna make it better, yeah yeah yeah yeah
So much better, yeah yeah yeah, in the summertime

One of these mornings, you're gonna wind up singin'
You're gonna spread your wings and take to the skies
Back to the morning, there ain't nothing can harm you, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
'Cause your mama and your daddy is standing, standing by

Help me sing, God bless you, God bless you
That's for you, James
That's for the people, I love you, sister
I love you, too
That's what we all need to do, express the love for your sister and your brother
That's all what it is

'Cause one of these mornings, yeah, you're gonna rise up singin', yeah yeah yeah
You're gonna spread your little wings, and take to the sky
I don't care whether you're white, black, blue or green, yeah yeah yeah yeah
I believe, I believe if you love your brother, nothing can harm you, yeah
Ah, 'cause your mama and your daddy is standing, standing by
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Is standing by
Summertime
Standing by
Standing by
Summertime
Summertime

// People Wake Up And Live //

Now I know Mother Nature feels very, very, very disgusted
With you and you, and especially you
Because we have really played a sho'nuff rip-off game on Mother Nature
We'll kill all the grass
And won't let the cool breeze last
We just won't let the water flow
And won't let the natural things grow

I know sometimes you feel the world has turned its back on you
But don't give up, heh, it'll come through for you
So wake up, people
Wake up, people
Give yourself a chance
You owe that to yourself
So wake up, people, give yourself a chance to lead

This morning I woke up, heh, feeling kinda bad
I missed all the cool breeze, and the clear air that I had
Ah, ooh, I've got to wake up
We've got to wake up
Let's give ourself a chance
We owe that to ourselves
Wake on up, we got to wake right up
Ah, woo-hoo, we wanna wake on up
Sometimes I get so uptight
I feel, feel, feel, feel, feel like the world is gonna clean outta sight
People, come on back
We just can't afford to overlook the crossroads
Let's go back, let's go back
And let's go right on back
And live
