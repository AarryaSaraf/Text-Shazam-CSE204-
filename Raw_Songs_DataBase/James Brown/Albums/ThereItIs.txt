// King Heroin //

Ladies and Gentlemen
Fellow Americans
Lady Americans
This is James Brown
I wanna talk to you about one of our
Most deadly
Killers in the country today
I had a dream the other night, and I
Was sittin' in my living room
Dozed off to sleep
So I start to dreamin'
I dreamed I walked in a place and
I saw a real strange, weird object
Standin' up talkin' to the people
And I found out it was Heroin
That deadly drug that go in your veins
He says:
I came to this country without a passport
Ever since then I've been hunted and sought
My little white grains are nothin' but waste
Soft and deadly and bitter to taste
I'm a world of power and all know it's true
Use me once and you'll know it, too
I can make a mere schoolboy forget his books
I can make a world-famous beauty neglect her looks
I can make a good man forsake his wife
Send a greedy man to prison for the rest of his life
I can make a man forsake his country and flag
Make a girl sell her body for a five-dollar bag
Some think my adventure's a joy and a thrill
But I'll put a gun in your hand and make you kill
In cellophane bags I've found my way
To heads of state and children at play
I'm financed in China, ran in Japan
I'm respected in Turkey and I'm legal in Siam
I take my addicts and make 'em steal, borrow, beg
Then they search for a vein in their arm or their leg
So, be you Italian, Jewish, Black or Mex
I can make the most virile of men forget their sex
So now, no, my man, you must (you know) do your best
To keep up your habit until your arrest
Now the police have taken you from under my wing
Do you think they dare defy me, I who am king?
Now, you must lie in that county jail
Where I can't get to you by visit or mail
So squirm - with discomfort - wiggle and cough (hack!)
Six days of madness, hah! You might throw me off
Curse me in name! Defy me in speech!
But you'd pick me up right no if I were in your reach
All through your sentence you've become resolved to your fate
Hear now! younng man and woman, I'll be waitin' at the gate
Don't be afraid, don't run! I'm not chased
Sure my name is Heroin! You'll be back for a taste
Behold, you're hooked!
Your foot is in the stirrup
And make -- haste!
Mount the steed!
And ride him well
For the white horse of heroin
Will ride you to Hell!
To Hell!
Will ride you to Hell!
Until you are dead!
Dead, brother! Dead!
This is a revolution of the mind
Get your mind together
And get away from drugs!
That's the man!
Back! Back

// Who Am I //

Who am I to make decisions
And try to change, change your way?
Who am I to pretend that things are going good
When they're getting worse every day?
Who am I to say who's gonna take you out
Where you're going and what you should do?
Who am I to sit right down, sit right down and cry
Because I just can't stop, I can't stop loving you

Who am I to take the time to answer, do you hear me?
And who am I to take the time to care?
Who am I to know that I love, love, love you so, yeah?
And who am I to worry at all?
Let me ask you one more time
Who am I to say when you're wrong, I'm right?
Who am I to say who's gonna take you home at night?
I'm your man, baby, that's who I am
I'm, I'm just your man
Do that mean something to you? Alright
I'm just your man

I'll be there beside when the going get tough
And things get so rough
When you can't find a friend nowhere, yeah
When you drop your head and say "I'm sorry," I'll understand
'Cause baby, let me tell you one more time, I'm your man
Hey, do you understand it when I take your hand, I'm your man?
I worry when you worry, and grieve when you grieve
I got, I got understanding and in you I'll always believe
I'll understand, 'cause I'm your man
Can't you understand me? Can't you understand me?
Do you know what it means when you got someone to love you?
Oh baby, yes baby, I'm your man

// Talking Loud And Saying Nothing //

Like a dull knife
Just isn't cutting
Just talking loud
Then saying nothing

Just saying nothing
Just saying nothing

You can't tell me
How to run my life down
You can't tell me
How to keep my business sound
You can't tell me
What I'm doing wrong
When you keep driving and
Singing that same old money song
You can't tell me
Which way to go
Because three times seven
And then some more
You can't tell me, hey

Like a dull knife
Just isn't cutting
Just talking loud
Then saying nothing

Just saying nothing
Just saying nothing

Don't tell me
How to do my thing
When you can't, can't
Can't do your own
Dont tell me how to be a boy
When, when you know I'm grown
Can't use me like a woman
Woman throws away her dress
And you can't tell me, hey
How to use my mess

You're like a dull knife
Jack, you just aren't cutting
You're just talking loud
Then saying nothing

Just saying nothing
And saying nothing

Shape up your bag
Don't worry bout mine
My thing together
And a doing fine
Good luck to you
Just allow you're wrong
Then keep on singing that
Same old money song

Then keep on singing that
Same old money song
Just keep on singing that
Same old money song

Then keep on singing that
Same old money song
Just keep on singing that
Same old money song

I got to, I want you
I must to, I got to
Ashes ashes and a dust to dust
I must ato jump on back
I'm doing a, my hands
I say I will, the point
Is too dark to fill
You say I can't
You're phony, you're phony

I said, I said, you're phony

// Public Enemy No. 1, Pt. 1 //

You know, this is James Brown
I'm such a lover of people
Because people did so much for me
I'm a lover of all humanity, all mankind
And I feel that he who has been successful
Should look out of for his fellow man, his brother
I feel that's my role, that's my job
I know when I was a kid
You see, I was going to be a preacher, heh, ay
Maybe I am, but to me, I feel like I'm a teacher, somewhat
Beacuse I've been able to experience things that most poor
Or a lot of people haven't been able to, even the rich
So I'll start by preaching right here
Because I want to preach to you one more time about heroin
I talked once before, now I want to preach
I want to start by saying
I heared heroin talking one more time, it said:

From where I came, nobody knows
I come from a land where the poppy seed grows
A whole nation gathered to plot my destruction
Beacause I'm a breeder of crime and wholesale corruption
You said, I'm pure and then undiluatable
And once I'm in your blood I make it pursuitable
And that old lady saying 'Sing it on, son
Sing it on, son'
She said 'I lost my son, he's gone on away
So, sing it on, son, you might save a life'
I said, Madam, said, looka here
I say, on the record and make all men
That dare to use it will wallow in sin
Driven them to commit a world of crime
Captured their will and destroy their mind
They changed their wise and destroyed the meek
Misused the fools and made the strong men weak
I know, wait a minute, looka here
They take gold from the rich and made them poor
Take a young foolish maiden and made her a whore
Looka there
And then I heard
By that time I heard a man over in the corner
He was sitting down with his head down low
I noticed him when I first walked in
And he was addicted to drugs, they say, I feel it
Said brother I want to get up and testify
So everybody started sceraming and hollering and crying
I saw a little tears coming from my eye
Because I know I felt it
And this brother got up and said 'let me have it
I want to tell you everything'
Talk to a man that knows
He said some will sell me and some will buy
For a state of affection and they cause high
But regardless of the position and reason of use
You control my addiction, I give nothing but abuse
He said let me tell you about heroin
With the full course of torment
For its pleasures and pain
It will take all of your money and poison your brain
Lord, I started singing, I said mmm
The place started rocking a little bit
I heared someone pat their foot and say 'sing on, brother'
I started humming a little bit in the background
And then that brother said 'wait a minute'
He said, 'beware of the sharp needle brother
It'll make you sick
Annoyed, anguished, and won't let you kick
It'll make you hustle, steal, borrow, and beg
I'm still talking about that bad thing, king heroin
When you want to look for a vein in your arm or your leg'
I felt so bad I didn't know what to do
He said, more priceless than diamond, more treasured than gold
More potent than whiskey, more gallant than wine
It'll just give you discomfort and no piece of mind
And when you come out the nod, he said you'll always be aware
You've shot every drop of your heart, and it's full of fear
Now you must rush out, hit another sting
Praise me as old heroin, the king
But he said 'be quick my friend and get off your knees
Ah yeah, get off your knees
You're uptight and accept no plea

// Public Enemy No. 1, Pt. 2 //

Feel good tonight
I feel good because I believe that some young man or some young girl out there
Will listen to me
I've been lucky
But most of all, I was dedicated to something I believe
I believe that if a man, if a man will live as long as he can and die when he can't help himself, he will succeed
I believe when a man has an undying determination
That he can make it if he try
So drugs got you down
Let me tell you this other part
Let me tell you this other part
Let me tell you the power they possessed
Power in the north, east, south, and west
I bet I'll hip you to more things you can do
The women that it turned around and the men that it slew
In Channel, it stopped an army
In France, it ran
It's armin' in Turkey
And believe me, they respect it in Tokyo and Japan
It hooks whole countries and had them enslaved
It take his honors and made them degrade
It makes addicts go out and steal
Take that which is not yours, go out and steal
Make hungry dope friend miss a meal
Now, anything that won't let a man eat, can't be too sweet
To salaam, to salaam, peace be unto you, As-Salaam-Alaikum, brother
To some, it's a solution - to others, it's a must
It'll make their soul grow heavy with lust
It'll make a man troubled
It will make a man in trouble rat on his friend
There's a reckless few, you understand me?
It'll make a man rat on his friend
Do you hear me? Use more
It exterminate, it exterminate
There's a regular few that use more than most
It'll exterminate them with a quick overdose - we call it an O.D
It'll make them shabby
Cats that used to dress on the corner be clean to the bone
Clean to the bone, never see 'em alone
All the time they got somethin' bad with 'em
Walking down the street with their main squeeze
It'll make them dress shabby when they used to dress neat
And all that use it, it'll make him weak
If you're ruthless, it'll make you ruthless, heartless, and don't give a damn
For the weak ones are always caught in a jam
Give it up, brother, give it up
I see the whole world around me
I see men falling by the wayside
I kids that are going to school
That mothers and dads struck up goals and sent 'em to school
And now they're bums on the corner
But let me tell ya, you don't have to be a bum
Take that will and get up, get up, get up, don't stand there
Get up, yeah, be a man, get up
Get up, get up, get up
You're too much woman to stand there
And you're too much man to make her stand there and wait on you
If you get up, man, she'll follow you
Get on up and walk away
Get up, get up, get up

// I Need Help (I Can't Do It Alone) //

Ya ya ya ya ya ya, I got to know now
Ooh, I got to know, ya ya ya ya ya ya
What's goin' on? What's goin' on?
Sure pretty, play it again, fellas
Alright

You know it sure is a groove when you got your girl
And you're parked at a trunk dark spot
Two miles away from the park, deep in the woods
And all of a sudden, you try to, you to be mellow, cozy and sweet
And she freeze up and go into her ignorant bag
But for somehow, some reason
You know, you've probably knowing the young lady for a long time
You're going to school together, and you're probably still going to school together
You wanna back up but you just can't quit, you just can't quit
You wanna leave but something keep pulling you back, ain't it nice?
I don't like to rain as I much as I like the dusk dark thing, you understand?
The sun is down real low
I just can see the brothers now in ham
Fellas in ham, I know what they're doing - Danny know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Play it again, brothers, play it sweet, play it sweet and soft
Play it sweet

Sure sounds good
