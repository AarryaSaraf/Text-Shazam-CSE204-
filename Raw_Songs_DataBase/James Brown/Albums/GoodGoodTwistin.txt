// Begging, Begging //

Won't even write, won't even call
You won't let me nothing at all
And now I'm begging, begging
Love nobody but you

You made me love you right from the start
And my baby you was gonna break my heart
And now I'm begging, begging
Love nobody but you

Oh baby you made me love you
And you keep my heart in pain
Oh baby there's no-one above you
And I wonder will we ever, ever love again

I know I loved you right from the start
And that's why you, you broke my heart
And now I'm begging, begging
Love nobody but you

Oh baby you made me love you
And you keep my heart in pain
Oh baby there's no-one above you
And I wonder will we ever, ever love again

You made me love you right from the start
And my baby you was gonna break my heart
I know why you, you broke my heart
And now I'm begging, begging
Love nobody but you
No-one but you

// Have Mercy Baby //

Have mercy, mercy, baby

Have mercy, mercy, baby

My heart is full of sorrow
Take me back where I belong

I've been good for nothing
I've lied and cheated too
I've been good for nothing
I've lied and cheated too

Been reaping all all my sorrow
I don't know what to do

Lord, have mercy, baby
Tell me, what have I done wrong
Have mercy, mercy, baby
Tell me, what have I done wrong

Been reaping all all my sorrow
Take me back where I belong
Oh, yeah, yeah

I've been good for nothing
I've lied and cheated too

Been reaping all all my sorrow
Tell me what I'm supposed to do

// Love Don't Love Nobody //

We'll talk about love, it's a talk about shame
Talk about love I hate that name
Love don't love poor me at all
Love is the cause of my downfall

Love don't love
Love don't love
Love don't love nobody

Love is fine it's from inside side
Love bit me wrong and how I cried
Love made baby, you put me down
And now the news is all over town

Love don't love
Love don't love
Love don't love nobody

Well! I'll get someone who's better than me
They can be smart and tall as a tree
All I wanna do is rock at home
Love's the proposition from now on!

Love don't love
Love don't love
Love don't love nobody

We'll talk about love, it's a talk about shame
Talk about love I hate that name
Love don't love poor me at all
Love is the cause of my downfall

Love don't love
Love don't love
Love don't love nobody

Love is fine it's from inside side
Love bit me wrong and how I cried
Love made baby, you put me down
And now the news is all over town

Love don't love
Love don't love
Love don't love nobody

// Just Won't Do Right (I Stay In The Chapel Every Night) //

Since you've been gone
I stay in the chapel every night

Girl, I stay in the chapel every night
Girl, you just won't do right

Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Am I the one?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Am I the one?

Tell me, tell me
Am I, am I, am I the one?
Since you've been gone I've been all alone
Waiting and watching for you

My heart is crying, slowly I am dying
But still I'm waiting for you
Since you've been gone

I stay in the chapel every night
Girl, I stay in the chapel every night
Just won't do right
