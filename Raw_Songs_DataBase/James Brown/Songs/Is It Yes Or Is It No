Did you ever, making me cry 
Did you ever, making me die 
Was it fun, making me suffer 
Was it fun, making me suffer 
Now is your answer ves ro is it no 

Is it yes or no 

I remember when you went home 
'Cause you left me you'll all alone 
Now was it fun when you said you weren't

Was it fun now when he made his little run 
Oh know on the 
Is it yes or Lorg is it yes 
Or is it no 
Is it yes or no 

Oh yes now you won't be back 
But remember you gave me my little sack 
Now darling you made my life complete 
Lord just thrown me out in the street now 
But I want your answer 
Is it yes, is it yes 
Oh Lord is it no 
Is it yes or no 

Tell me, is it yes 
Or is it no, is it yes
