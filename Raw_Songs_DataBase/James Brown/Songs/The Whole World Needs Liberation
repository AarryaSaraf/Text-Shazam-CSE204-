We need liberation, we need liberation
We need liberation, we need liberation

Get on the boat and do your thing
Turn yourself loose and let your motor spring
Now go ahead... huh

We need liberation, we need liberation
We need liberation, we need liberation

I told you just two days ago
Get down, huh! Let yourself go, uh-huh

We need liberation, we need liberation
We need liberation, we need liberation

No need to worry, no need to fret
About the funky thing, that you're not gonna get
Now do it now, if you can

We need liberation, we need liberation
We need liberation, we need liberation

Now get back in the corner, don't let your body move
Stand up and dig yourself, huh, and try to groove
You can do it, if you want to

We need liberation, we need liberation
We need liberation, we need liberation

But if you find that you can't get no rap
And then you know the way between the generation gap
Sing it, uh-huh, there you are

We need liberation, we need liberation
We need liberation, we need liberation

Look at the future and see the situation
The whole world needs liberation

We need liberation, we need liberation
We need liberation, we need liberation

One thing you gotta do is do for self
And then there won't be no trouble
In helping someone else, sing it

We need liberation, we need liberation (you can do it)
We need liberation (huh), we need liberation

Try to be good in everything you do
Then you won't have to worry about what others do
Do for self

We need liberation, we need liberation
We need liberation, we need liberation

There's neither black or white, it's what's right
There's neither white or black, it's the fact
Sing it, one more now

We need liberation, we need liberation (the whole world need it)
We need liberation, we need liberation

Now groove, now groove, now groove
Now groove, now groove, groove
Now groove, now groove, go on
Now groove, now groove
Groove, groove, groove, groove, groove, alright
Groove, groove, groove now, say it

(Groove) we need liberation, (come on) we need liberation
(Say it) we need liberation, (say it) we need liberation

Hold it... one time, two time, three time, four time
Now louder, now, let me hear you
We need liberation, we need liberation, we need liberation...
