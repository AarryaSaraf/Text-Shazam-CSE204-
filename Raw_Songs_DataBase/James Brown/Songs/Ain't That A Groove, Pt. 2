Hit me band, look at the band 
I want to ask them 

Do you love me, yes I love you 
Do you love me baby, yes I love you 
Do you love me, yes I love you, do you 
I just gotta, gotta know 

Look here, I'm not gonna talk all day 
But I, I wanted to get the feeling 
One more time 
Hit me band, listen to that band 
I want to ask them 
Do you love me, yes I love you 
Do you love me baby, yes I love you 
Do you love me, yes I love you 
I just gotta, gotta know 
Hey ain't that a groove 
Ain't that a groove let me count 
One for the money, two for the show 
Ain't that a groove now here we go 
Goin'on, and one more thing 
I want to say, this is better than cushions 
Christmas only comes once a year 
And this is all year'round 
People can, I'm livin' 
Let me out, I'm gone, yeah I'm going back
