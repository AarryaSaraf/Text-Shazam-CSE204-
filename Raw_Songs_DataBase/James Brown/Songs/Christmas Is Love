Oh, what a beautiful way to express thyself
Knowing that Christmas is love, alright
Oh, what a beautiful way to express thyself
Knowing that Christmas is love
Oh, what a fantabulous way to let everyone know what it means
And what it meant to be like the stars above
Hey hey, oh, what it mean, a fantabulous way
To let everyone know what it meant to be
What it was meant to be, like the stars above

Where everybody in the whole world through
Let the world say and rest in peace to
Let all of us pray for peace
And for all of the war to cease
Let all of us get down on our knees and pray for peace
And for all wars to cease
Listen to me

Oh, what a beautiful way to express thyself
Knowing that Christmas is love
Oh, hey hey hey hey, what a beautiful way to express thyself
Knowing that Christmas is love
Oh, what a fantabulous way to let everyone know
It was meant to be, like the stars above
What, what, what, what a fantabulous way
To let everyone know it was meant to be, like the stars above

If you read me, you could see that the Christmas tree is a symbol of love
And everyone in the, in the whole world
Let the whole world think, and let it be
And let 'em rest in peace, too
Let the whole world through
Let the whole world think and rest in peace, too
Oh

Let us all pray for peace, get down
You got to be down when you pray for peace
And for all wars to cease
What a fantabulous to let everyone know
To let everyone know that it was meant to be and like the stars above
And what a beautiful way to express knowing that Christmas is love
Everyone, if you read me, you could see
That the Christmas tree is a symbol of love
And what a fantabulous way to let everyone know
That it was meant to be like the stars above
Shining, oh, sprinkle from the lights of love
Doin' it, oh
Like the flow from the bird that's known as a dove
White as snow, from the stars, mean the lights of love
Let us all pray for peace, and for all the wars to cease
For everybody the whole day through
Let the whole word think, rest in peace, too
