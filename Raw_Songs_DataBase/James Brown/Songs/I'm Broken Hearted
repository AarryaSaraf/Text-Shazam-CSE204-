Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm...
My heart is so heavy, I don't know what to do
Ah... my heart is so heavy, I don't know what to do
I haven't had a mighty, mighty good time
Baby, since I've lost you
Oh Lord, I don't know what to do
Baby, don't you leave
Don't you say I'm through!

Don't leave me, don't break my heart
What you say is true, that you and I are through
I'm so broken hearted, I don't know what to do
I'll pick up my rags and go, said I'm gonna quit
I can't take no more, baby I've got to split

Baby, don't break my heart
Baby, don't break my heart, oh!
Baby, don't do it, don't break my heart
Yeah, yeah...

If you don't change your place
I'll wash my dirty, dirty face
Clean my hands, got to take a stand
Come here pretty baby, tug in your big breast pad
Rock me pretty mama, till my face turns cherry red!

Baby, oh baby, oh Lord
Baby, baby, oh baby
Baby! If what you say is true
Then you and I are through

Don't do it, baby don't do it
Baby, don't break my heart!
Oh, don't do it, don't break my heart
Baby, don't break it, baby...
Baby, don't break my heart!
Baby, don't you break my heart
Oh baby, baby don't, baby...
Baby, baby, don't break my heart!
Baby, don't do it, don't break my heart

If you change your place
I'll wash your dirty, dirty face
I've got to clean my hands, it's time to take a stand
Don't break it, woo-hoo!
No, don't break it, don't break my heart
I need some help, oh Lord

I'm broken hearted, but you know I am through
I can't take no more, I just don't know what to do
Don't break it, don't break my heart
Hey, give it, baby... baby, baby, so good
Baby, you don't know, baby!

Gonna wash my dirty, dirty face
Get up, it's time! Gotta to find somebody
Who wants, weee-hee-hee!
Who won't break my heart
Who won't break my, don't break my heart!
Don't break my heart! No, don't break it
Don't break my heart, baby, don't...

Oh... I can see it now, yeah...
Yeah, I can see it too... this smile...
What from, moments... I can see it...
There are pink letters...
Very clear, right ahead of me... hey sis...
I can see it all night...!
Yes, I can see it too...
