Chicago, Chicago, that toddling town
Chicago, Chicago, I'll show you around, I love it
Bet your bottom dollar, you'll lose the blues in Chicago
Chicago, the town that Billy Sunday couldn't shut down

On State Street, that great street, I just want to say
They do things that they don't do on Broadway
They have the time, the time of their life
I saw a man, he danced with his wife in Chicago
Chicago, my home town

Chicago, Chicago, that toddling town
Chicago, Chicago, I'll show you around, I love it
Bet your bottom dollar, you'll lose the blues in Chicago
Chicago, the town that Billy Sunday could not shut down

On State Street, that great street, I just want to say
They do things that they never do on Broadway, say
They have the time, the time of their life
I saw a man and he danced with his wife in Chicago

Chicago, Chicago that's my home town
