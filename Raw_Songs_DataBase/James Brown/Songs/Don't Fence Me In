Yeah, when things get too thick
And they got to thin out
That's okay too, but deal with me, do me right

Give me land, lots of land under the troubled skies above
But don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wide open country that I love
Don't fence me in

Let me lie by myself in the evening breeze
And listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever but I ask you please
But don't fence me in

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the Western skies
On my Cayuse, let me wander over yonder
'Til I see the mountain rise

I wanna ride where the West commences
And check out Sacramento and L.A
'Til I lose my senses
I don't play hobbles and I can't stand fences
But don't, don't fence me in

Come on, mmm
Don't, don't exile my thoughts
Turn me loose, yeah yeah yeah
Give me some room now
Getting hard out here

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the Western skies
On my Cayuse, let me wander over yonder
'Til I see the mountain high

I wanna ride where the West commences
And check out San Diego
'Til I lose my senses
Can't stand hobbles and I don't want no more fences
But don't, don't fence me in

Give the man a chance
Open up, open up the door
Don't fence me in
What about the kids?
Don't fence me in
Ay hey hey hey hey
What about the kids?
Don't fence me in
Give me some room
