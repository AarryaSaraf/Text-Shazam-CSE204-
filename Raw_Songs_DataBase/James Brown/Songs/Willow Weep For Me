Baby, hey hey hey hey hey, baby
Baby

Willow weep for me
Willow weep for me
Bend your branches green along the stream that runs to sea
Listen to my plea
Listen willow and weep for me, alright

Gone my lovers dream
Lovely summer dream
Gone and left me here to weep my tears into the stream
Sad as I can be
Hear me willow and weep for me

Whisper to the wind and say that love has sinned
To leave my heart a-breaking, and making a moan
Murmur to the night to hide a starry light
So none will find me sighing and crying all alone, oh

Weeping willow tree
Weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me, oh
When the shadows fall, bend little willow and weep for me
Weep for me

Whisper to the wind and say that love has sinned
Leave my heart breaking, and making a moan
Murmur to the night to hide a starry light
So none will find me sighing and crying all alone, oh no

Weeping willow tree
Weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When your shadows fall, bend little willow and weep for me
Weep for me

When I'm sick, can't do no better
All I need is one little letter
Weeping, said I'm, said I'm, said I'm weeping
I'm weeping, I'm weeping willow tree
You got to weep in sympathy
You got to weep in sympathy
Willow, oh willow, oh willow weep for me
Weep on, willow weep for me
Weep on, oh now, oh now
