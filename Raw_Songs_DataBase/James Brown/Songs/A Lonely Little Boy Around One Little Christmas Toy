A lonely little boy
Around a Christmas toy
A lonely little boy
Around one little Christmas toy
He was crying, he said
"I'm giving it up, I can't take no more
I've got to get even with you, you, you so and so
I'm gonna make a copy, I'll do every, every, every move
Can you feel it now? Now, ain't that a groove?"
And I said, "Don't get anger, son, you've got to come through
Because the same way you feel, now, I felt that same way, too"
Now sing it, he sang, "I've got to come through, I can't forget
I've got to come through, no, I just can't forget"
Don't let that one little toy get you down 'cause you're still out of sight
Yes you are, bless your heart, and don't you fret
And don't ever, ever, ever fall down

A lonely little boy
A lonely little boy
Hangin' around one little lonely toy
Can you imagine how he feels?
Other kids got a father to come home and say
"What you want for Christmas, son?"
And he recites everything he wants for Christmas
But the little boy over there stands with his head down
Tears falling on his cheek
I, I know how he feels, I know how he feels, too
Because that wasn't always a little boy, it was me
And sometimes I believe, that I know that it was you
Help him somebody, oh, help that little boy standing over there
He needs shelter, the rain is falling on his head
Help him, let him come in
Let the little boy who wanna get himself a Christmas toy
Do what you can, people
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Help him, people, oh-ho, oh
Lord, oh, help him, people
Hey hey hey hey hey hey, oh, oh, help him
