YOW! Sex machine

Problems all the time
Nothing but problems all the time
If it ain't one thing, it's another

Up in the morning, with the sun
Work all day, 'til the people come
Pictures of a coal job in my hand
Lord have mercy on a working man
If ain't one thing (If it ain't one thing)
It's another (It's another)
If ain't one thing (If it ain't one thing)
It's another (It's another)

My pay goes down, taxes up
I drink my tea, yeah, from a broken cup
Between my woman and, Uncle Sam
I ain't got no answer, I wonder whose fool I am

Problems all the time
(Working through a lotta problems all the time)
Problems, yeah yeah, all the time (All the time)
All the time now, na na na, ha (All the time)
Got a, got a, got problems, yeah yeah, all the time (All the time)
HO! (All the time)

Take me, my woman treat all right, yeah
Tomorrow, we gotta fuss and fight
If it ain't one thing, it's another
If it ain't one thing, yeah yeah, it's another
If it ain't one thing, it's another
If it ain't one thing, it's another, wait
(If it ain't one thing) Say it (It's another)
Pay goes down, tax goes up
(If it ain't one thing, it's another)
Taking a beating from a broken cup, doing bad
(If it ain't one thing, it's another)
Between my woman and, Uncle Sam
(If it ain't one thing, it's another)
Sometimes I got to wonder whose damn fool I am
(If it ain't one thing, it's another)
Problems, problems, hey
(If it ain't one thing, it's another)
Problems, problems
(If it ain't one thing, it's another)
If it ain't one thing, I said that it's another
(If it ain't one thing, it's another)
If it ain't one thing...
