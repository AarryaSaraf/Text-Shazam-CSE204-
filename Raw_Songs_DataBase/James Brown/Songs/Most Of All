You know, Bobby Byrd, one of the Famous Flames,  he is
In fact, everybody, we got the whole First Family in here tonight
Everybody's reminiscing, singing 'bout beautiful things
And the Famous Flames are gonna be doing some thing behind colors 
Hey, we got a new bag be coming out - but dig this one

Most of all, I want your warm embrace
No one can take your place
I need you most of all, heh
Most of all, I want your sweet caress
Truly, I must confess
I need you, most of all... sure sounds good

When I sleep at night
I dream wonderful, wonderful dreams of you
And when I awake
No one's there and then
Why I'm so blue?

Most of all, I want that one thing I miss
The way we used to kiss
I need you most of all, most of all

When I sleep at night
I dream wonderful, wonderful dreams of you
And when I awake
No one's there and then, heh
Why I'm so blue?

Most of all, the one thing that I miss
The way we used to kiss, mhm, mhm
I need you most of... uhh... all...!
