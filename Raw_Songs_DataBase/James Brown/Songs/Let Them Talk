Let them talk if they want to
Talk don't bother me
I want the whole wide world to know
That I love you so

Let them whisper, for they know not what
Between you and I
I'll keep on loving you
Until the day I die

They're trying to break up our romance
But they don't have, they don't have a chance
We have the kind of love that was so strong
And we'll be together from now on, oh
I know that gossip comes from the devil's workshop
But true love will make it stop
I want the whole wide world to know
That I love you so

They're trying to break up our romance, darling
They don't stand a possible chance
We have the kind of love that was strong
And we'll be together from now on, oh

Let them talk, let them tell everybody, I don't care
Let them talk, let them tell everybody
Hit me now, hit me

Don't bother me, oh, oh no
Oh, let them tell everybody
Sometime, sometime, they just don't
They just don't, they just don't understand now
But come on, hit me now, hit me
Oh baby, I wanna feel, I wanna feel
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Hit me now
Let them talk, let them talk
Let them talk, let them talk
Hit me now, hit me, baby
Oh, I just know, I just know
I don't understand it...
