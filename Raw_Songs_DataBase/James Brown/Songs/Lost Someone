I, I lost someone, a million to one
Ten thousand people under my Father's sun
We need someone, someone, the only one
Just that someone who needs someone under the sun
To care for, care for... just that someone, oh hey...

Now, I got somethin' I wanna tell everybody
Huh, I got somethin' I want everybody to understand now
You know, we all make mistakes sometime
And the only way we can correct our mistakes
We've got to try it one more time (one more time)
Now I got to sing this song for you one more time (one more time)
I want you to know, that I'm not singing this song
Only for myself now (sing this song)
I'm not singing this song only for myself now (sing this song)
I'm singing it for you too

And when I say something, when I say that little thing
It make you feel golden inside
I wanna hear you, sing that little problem
Might sting in your heart
Wanna hear you scream (ow...)
Don't just say "aye", say "aye!" (aye)
Say "OW!" (ow!), ow, hey-yeah...

And I believe in what could be done 
Yeah, I want you to scream one more time (ah...)
Yeaaah... scream one more time, feels good to me now
I said, gettin' good to me now
OWW, yiiiieah, ha-haaw... feels good to me now
I feel good, wanna know what you do when you feel good
Sometimes just hum a little bit
I remember we used to come back, just, I said mmm... (ow...)
Waaa-hey... mmm... (ow...)
Oh, I hear you scream, and I believe I gotta come on over
Hey, yaaaa-ha-hey, yeah... I feel good, oh, I feel good...
