Have a happy day

If you see my baby
Tell her that I'm back in town
Tell her that I really miss her
And I didn't mean to put her down
I'd run around all over town
And it broke her heart in two
But now, I'm down on my knees, baby
Even though I know we're through
I still want you to, yeah yeah

Have a happy day
Hope love comes your way
Look here, baby
Now and forever
Baby
Have a happy day
Hope love comes your way
Now and forever
One more, one more time, baby

I apologize for being so hard-headed, baby
And I'm sorry for telling you those lies
I know you would never let me come back, sugar sugar
Because of the way I hurt you inside, heh

Now I've grown a little wiser, dear
And I realize I was such a drag
Please think, think of the good things, oh na na na na
From in the future, and forget about the past heartbreaking past
Oh baby

Have a happy day
Hope loves comes your way
Now and forever
Think about the good things, baby
Baby, when I had my thing
Have a happy day
Hope love comes your way
Now and forever
Baby
Have a happy day
Hope love comes your way
Now and forever
Forever, forever, WOO
Have a happy day
Hope love comes your way
Now and forever
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Have a happy day
Hope love comes your way
Now and forever
