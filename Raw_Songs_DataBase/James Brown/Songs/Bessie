Everybody get on the floor
I wanna do it some more
We're having a party
Come on, now, hey!

Bessie, Bessie, shake
While you're able
Shake it, Bessie
I know you're capable
Bessie, Bessie, shake
While you're able
Shake it, Bessie
I know you're capable

Bessie, Bessie, shake
What you've got
Shake it, baby
You've got a lot
Bessie, Bessie, shake
What you've got
Shake it, Bessie
You've got a lot

Bessie, Bessie, shake
And clap your hands
Shake it, Bessie
For the peanut man
Bessie, Bessie, shake
And clap your hands, everybody
Shake it, Bessie
For the peanut man

Come on, get down
Shake it, Bessie
Shake it, Bessie

I want everybody
Now, Bessie, you get on one side of the floor and let the party get on the other side
Now I want all the skinny girls to get in the middle
Because the skinny girls gotta shake it twice as hard as you, Bessie
And you've got something to shake, mama
Lookie here
 I dig it
Baby, got to give it up
Baby, got to give it up

Bessie, good god

Bessie, Bessie, shake
While you're able
Shake it, Bessie
We know that you're capable
Bessie, Bessie
Take the floor
We want
You to shake some more
Bessie, Bessie, Bessie
Gonna get down
Bessie, Bessie
Bessie, Bessie
Shake what what you've got
Shake it baby, you've got a lot

I feel good, come on, baby
Wait a minute, I figured I could shake it down with you

Get back into my thing

I ain't gonna funk with that
With that, Bessie
I ain't gonna funk with that
With that, Bessie

I better rap to y'all

Bessie, Bessie, shake
What you've got
Shake it, Bessie
You've got a lot

Hit it, J.B.'s

Bessie, Bessie, shake
What you've got
Shake it, Bessie
You've got a lot

I need some help here
I need some help, can't do it alone
I better roll my feet up and down on you, Bessie

Bessie, Bessie, shake
What you've got
Shake it, Bessie
You've got a lot
