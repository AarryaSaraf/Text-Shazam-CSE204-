Now I know Mother Nature feels very, very, very disgusted
With you and you, and especially you
Because we have really played a sho'nuff rip-off game on Mother Nature
We'll kill all the grass
And won't let the cool breeze last
We just won't let the water flow
And won't let the natural things grow

I know sometimes you feel the world has turned its back on you
But don't give up, heh, it'll come through for you
So wake up, people
Wake up, people
Give yourself a chance
You owe that to yourself
So wake up, people, give yourself a chance to lead

This morning I woke up, heh, feeling kinda bad
I missed all the cool breeze, and the clear air that I had
Ah, ooh, I've got to wake up
We've got to wake up
Let's give ourself a chance
We owe that to ourselves
Wake on up, we got to wake right up
Ah, woo-hoo, we wanna wake on up
Sometimes I get so uptight
I feel, feel, feel, feel, feel like the world is gonna clean outta sight
People, come on back
We just can't afford to overlook the crossroads
Let's go back, let's go back
And let's go right on back
And live
