It's all for one, and one for all!
Together we'll overcome, divided we'll fall!

From slave ships to the championships...
People! We've got to use the power of Soul
To drive us to our final goal
We've got to unify, and we must, we must pull together
Together we're strong, and we can become a people
And control our own destiny

For too many years we've been behind
Now it's time for us, to use our mind
One strong mind, we've got to think together

(Our people are beautiful!) And right and strong!
We've known this all along, so don't ever back up!
(We're black and proud!) Say it loud!
(We're people are proud!)
Open up the door! (I'll get it myself!)

The man's got a way of tearing us down
Making us mess each other's around
Don't let him win, while he goes up with laughing grin
And don't you laugh and grin

Say it loud! (We're people and proud!)
Say it loud! (We're people and proud!)

It's been a long hard fight, and it's not all yet done
It won't be over, until we get what men should have
And that's respect, respect from your fellow man
Respect from the other man, mm-hmm...
It's gotta be all for one, it's gotta be all for one
Help me out, Fred!

It's gotta be all for one! (All for one!)
And one for all! (And one for all!)
Together we'll overcome, divided we'll fall!
All for one! (All for one!)
And one for all! (And one for all!)
Together we'll overcome, divided we'll fall!

Mmm, I feel like I wanna moan...
It's friend or warrior
Open up the door! (I'll get it myself!)

, Du Bois, Martin Luther King
Mmm... it's all for one, one for all
Together we will overcome, divided we'll fall
It's all for one, one for all
Together we will overcome, divided we'll fall
It's all for one, huh, and one for all
Together we will overcome, divided we will fall

Uh, release me, release me!
Just let me think for myself, think for myself
Say it loud! (We're people are proud!)
Say it loud! (We're people are proud!)
A winner, say it loud! (We're people are proud!)
Open up the door! (I'll get it myself!)
Open up the door! (I'll get it myself!)
Open up the door! (I'll get it myself!)

It's all for one, and one for all!
Together we'll overcome, divided we'll fall!
We've got to use the power of Soul
To drive us home to our final goal
We've got to unify, and we must pull together

(Our people are beautiful!) And right and strong!
We've known this all along, so don't ever back up!
(We're right and proud!)
Say it loud! (We're people are proud!)
Say it loud! (We're people are proud!)
Martin Luther said, say it loud! (We're people are proud!)
 said, say it loud! (We're people are proud!)
Du Bois said, say it loud! (We're people are proud!)
Du Bois said...

Oh... I can see it now, yeah...
Yeah, I can see it too... this smile...
What from, moments... I can see it...
There are pink letters...
Very clear, right ahead of me... hey sister...
I can see it all night...!
Yes, I can see it too...
