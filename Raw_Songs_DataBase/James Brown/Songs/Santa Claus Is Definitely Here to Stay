Ain't no use in saying there ain't no Santa Claus
'Cause Santa Claus is definitely here to stay in the mind
Ain't no use in saying there ain't no money in the bank for toys
'Cause it was put up a long time ago for a rainy day

Ain't no use in saying you don't love all your brats
'Cause I'm watching you as you hustle them off to play
Keep the family strong with a little faith, love and hope
And you can always get along

Ain't no use, oh now, in crying about spilt milk in the past
Because all the cats had a feast
Ain't no use in worrying about who's doing you wrong
Just leave them there and go away in peace

Ain't no use in saying what you gonna do and what you ain't gonna do
Because with your power, you doing your best
So release yourself from all that strain and take that money out the bank
And just give your, give yourself a rest

Take some of that money in the bank and give yourself a play
'Cause Santa Claus is definitely here to stay
Ain't no use, ain't no use, ain't no use

Ain't no use in saying, "Ah, I would like to get rid of them all"
'Cause you know you're only fooling yourself
So grab one hand on the wheel and the other around your kids
And go on and laugh yourself to death

Ain't no use in saying "I wouldn't, I wouldn't give a nickel for them all"
When you know you wouldn't take nothing for either one
So go on tell the truth 'cause if you don't you a lying son of a gun
'Cause you wouldn't take nothing for them all

Ain't no use, oh now
You know I probably won't be there this Christmas
But if I do I still want to say "Merry Christmas" to you and especially you
I wanna say "Merry Christmas" to all the people who can't find themselves
Let's try to get together live in peace
Love one another and treat each and man like he's your brother
With a little love, and kindness
