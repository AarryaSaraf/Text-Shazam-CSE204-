I know sometimes, during the hassles of the day
You feel that "What the heck? The harder I try, the rougher it get hit"
And when you do everything you can to make evrything be alright
And meet your bills, you understand, and your loved one seems to thank you like:
"Hey, you're not trying, you could do a little bit better"
Nobody understands where you're coming from, you say to yourself:
"Hey, I gotta prove it to me 'cause I know where I'm at"
And this is what you do

I know sometimes you feel the world has turned its back on you
But don't give up, it'll come through for you
So wake up, baby
Wake up, baby
Give yourself a chance
You owe that to yourself
So wake up, baby, give yourself a chance to live

This morning I got up, heh, feeling kinda down
But I say that's always the way
If you get yourself up off the ground
Let me wake up
And give myself a chance
I've got to wake right up
Wake right up and give yourself a chance to live

I know you're just human
And sometimes it can be a sho'nuff ruin
But when the feeling's too hard
Just take it to the Supreme
Force, and that's God
Wake up, baby
I've got to wake on up
Everybody needs to wake right up
Give yourself a chance to live
It's all there for you just go and get it
Wake on up
You owe it to yourself and no one else
