I don't mind your love
I don't mind the one
You're thinking of

But I know, I know
You're gonna miss me

I don't mind
Your body and soul
I don't mind your
Love growing cold

But I know, I know
You're gonna miss me

I don't mind
This is my song
I don't mind
Goodbye, so long

I know, I know
You're gonna miss me

Yeah
I know, I know
I know, know, know
Know, know, know, know
