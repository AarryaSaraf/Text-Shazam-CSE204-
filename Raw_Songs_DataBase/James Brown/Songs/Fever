Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a feeling that's so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me
And fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the mornin'
And fever all through the night

Listen to me, baby
Hear ev'ry word I say
No one can love you the way I do
Because they don't know how to love you my way
You give me fever baby, when you kiss me
And fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the mornin'
And fever all through the night

Bless my soul I love you
Take this ole heart away
And take this arms I'll never use
And just believe in what my lips have to say
You give me fever a-a, when you kiss me
And fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the mornin'
And fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
My eyes light up when you call James Brown
I know you gonna love me right
Mmh mmh, baby, mmh...
Oh - no no - oh
My face is wet, my face, my face
My face is wet, yeah, my face is wet...
