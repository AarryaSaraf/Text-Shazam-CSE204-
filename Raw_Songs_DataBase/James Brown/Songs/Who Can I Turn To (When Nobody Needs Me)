Everybody gets down sometimes...
But who can I turn to (who can I turn to)
When nobody, nobody needs me?
My heart wants to know (no one James, no one James)
So I must go (no one James, no one James)
Where destiny leads me

With no star to guide me (no star to guide me)
And no one beside me (no one James)
I'll go on my way (till the day)
After the day
The darkness will hide me

And maybe tomorrow (maybe tomorrow)
Oh, I'll find what I'm after (ah...)
Mm, I'll throw off my sorrow (ooh...)
Beg, steal, or borrow
My, my, my share of laughter

With you I could learn to (ah...)
With you, oh, what a new day
But tell me, who can I turn to
Baby, if you, if you turn away?
Turn away, ah...

(Ah...) And maybe, and maybe tomorrow
I'll find what I'm, what I'm after
I'll throw off my sorrow
Beg, plead, steal, or borrow!
Hey, my my my one last, my one last laughter

With you I could learn to...
With you, on a, on a, on a new day
But who can I turn to (who can I turn to)
Tell me, if you turn away? (if you turn away?)
Don't leave me, don't turn away
Don't say goodbye, don't turn away...

(This cat can sing fast, slow, funky, any kind of way!)
