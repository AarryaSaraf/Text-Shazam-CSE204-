(Body, check it out now... You got a body...
Funky, funky body, check it out...
Tell 'em mighty Godfather, go...)

You've got this on your mind, telling them we are through
You wanna fight the world by yourself, I know it's true
You really don't wanna stay, I know you've made up your mind
But before you go away, see what you left behind

Check your body (check your body)
Check it out (check it out)
Check out your (funky, funky) body
(Check your body) body
(Check your body) ooh, ooh, ooh
(Check it our now)

So we just can't get a loan, we just can't get a loan
It's always for others meant
If it's not, where have you been?
It's probably where your money's spent
I know you wanna go, but try on your mind
Your mind is already gone, but before you make a move...

Check it out! (check your body)
Check out your funky body (body!)
My man! (your body) I made it mine
Body! (body) yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Mm! Say brother... play me a new groove, if you don't mind

Mm! You wake up, baby
You make your own money, you drive your own car
You'll never be lonely, to your friends you are a star
You've won every man you need, ah, uh-huh
Ease your troubling mind, and see what you left behind!

So check your body (your body)
You better think about it!
And give yourself some time, and check your body
(Check your body) body (body)

Now Fred! (Yeah?)
Move air back there, and blow your horn, brother
I need a little reverb, 'cause I wanna sound deep and gritty
Pretty is on the corner, street lady! Woo!
Street lady, street lady, yeah yeah yeah yeah...
You star you, street lady, woo...!

Oh... I can see it now, yeah...
Yeah, I can see it too... this smile...
What from, moments... I can see it...
There are pink letters...
Very clear, right ahead of me... hey sister...
I can see it all night...!
Yes, I can see it too...
