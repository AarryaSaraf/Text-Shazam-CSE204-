Time and time I tell myself
Something's gotta give
But the harder I try
I keep finding out that I just wanna live
So if things with you have been kinda rough
And life is hard and living is a little too tough
Don't give up, don't lose the trail
Because nothing beats a try
Nothing beats a try
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing beats a try but a fail

Somewhere along the way
I got like a boat without a sail
But I'm gonna row it just like a captain, yeah yeah
Because nothing beats a try but a fail

Concentration and aggravation
Will drive you stone out of your mind
But determination and dedication
Will win out all the time
But nevertheless, if it's not my day
I'll do my best, yeah, 'cause pain could always be that way
Nothing beats a try but a fail
Nothing beats a try but a fail
