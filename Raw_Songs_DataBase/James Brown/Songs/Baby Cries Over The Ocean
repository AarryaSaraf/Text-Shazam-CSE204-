Baby cries over the ocean 
Baby cries over the sea
Baby cries over the ocean
(Baby cries over the sea)
(Baby cries over the ocean)
Bring back my baby to me

Baby cries over the ricer
Baby cries over the park
Hold and I love her and I miss her
Sing about her in my song
Baby cries over the ocean
Bring back my baby to me

You can cry me a river
Cry me an ocean
I won't drown a mountain in tears
You know pretty baby
You give me a notion
It's your boyfriend that I do fear 
...

You can cry me a river
