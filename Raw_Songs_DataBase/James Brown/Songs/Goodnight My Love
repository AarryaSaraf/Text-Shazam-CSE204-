Goodnight, my love
Goodnight, my love
Goodnight, my love
Goodnight, my love
Goodnight, my love
Goodnight, my love
Goodnight

Goodnight, my love
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me

Before you go
There's one thing I'd like to know
Please remember that I need you so
And this love will never grow cold

Oh, if you should awake (Awake)
In the still of the night (The night)
Please have no fear
I'll be there, you know I care
Please bring your love to, to me

Before you go
There's just one thing I'd like to know
Please bring your love to me

If you should awake (Awake)
In the still of the night (The night)
Please have no fear
Oh, I'll be there, you know I care
Please bring your love to, to me

Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go
Goodnight, sweetheart
Well, it's time to go

I hate to leave you
But I really must say goodnight, sweetheart
Mmm, good night tonight, good night tonight
Goodnight, sweetheart
Goodnight, sweetheart
Goodnight, sweetheart
Nothing like the good oldies
Always say it right here, still good
Goodnight, sweetheart
So Fred, Bobby, yeah, I got you, brother man
What was you doing when this song came out?
The young fellas don't know what's happening but it's still good
And you, too, sister, you fine little foxy devil you
Goodnight, sweetheart, well, it's time to go
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
