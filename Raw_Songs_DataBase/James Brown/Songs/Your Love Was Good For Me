Hey

Love was once a stranger
In this little old heart of mine
But until I found you
I never knew what love was all about
No no no no no

You showed me how to live
From day to day
Brought me out of the darkness
And showed me the way

Your love was good for me
Yes, your sweet love was good for me
Hit me

It seems like a dream
A dream fitted for a king
And only, only a girl like you
Could make my dreams come true

Your love was good for me
Yes, your sweet love was good for me
Listen to me

Now now now
Me and you, my darlin'
Was the best thing could ever happen to me
And knowing my life could change
But since I've met you, baby, I wanna let you know right now
That I have no complaints, and let me say

Your love was good for me
Your sweet love was good for me
Listen to me, it was good for me, good to me
Good with me, good for ya
My love, my love, ah ow, hey
Let me, ow
Your love was good for me
Your sweet love was good for me
Let me, ow
Your sweet love was good for me
Your sweet, your sweet love was good for me
Don't ever forget me, darling
Don't ever forget me, baby
