I walked alone yes that's true
I get the blues from thinkin' of you
And it hurts, yes, yes, I know it hurts
Though we're apart oh yes though we're apart

Baby please walk too, baby please walk too
Baby please walk too, baby please walk too
Baby please walk too

Baby if you be one more life
Baby take me in your arms at night
Baby case out all of man
Baby please, one more chance

Baby please walk too, baby please walk too
Baby please walk too, baby please walk too
Baby please walk too

Baby I just can't think about nobody but you
You know you're mine, yes everything you do
Baby give me my old romance
