Since you've been gone
I stay in the chapel every night

Girl, I stay in the chapel every night
Girl, you just won't do right

Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Am I the one?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Am I the one?

Tell me, tell me
Am I, am I, am I the one?
Since you've been gone I've been all alone
Waiting and watching for you

My heart is crying, slowly I am dying
But still I'm waiting for you
Since you've been gone

I stay in the chapel every night
Girl, I stay in the chapel every night
Just won't do right
