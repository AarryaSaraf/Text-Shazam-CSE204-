One of these days 
You gonna miss me 
So many ways 
Lord have mercy 
You gonna miss me 
I wanna know 
Is it love, is it a game 

And if it's love 
Can I, can I explain 
Tell me, Lord have mercy 
You know you told me 
That you love me 
That your love I'll always share 
But now baby hey 
You showed me 
'Bout your love, my love 
Will we compare 
I wanna know 
Is it love, is it a game 

And if it's love 
Can I, can I explain
