Yeah pretty baby listen to what I say 
You will always pay my way 
Let me hear pretty baby 
Remember what you say 
Daddy I will always bring you my bread 
I feel so bad I just can't take it 
Come on honey and let's make it 
Baby you know you've got to move 
Ain't no stamina, ain't no groove 
Baby you know we've got to move 
Ain't no stamina, ain't no groove 
Baby you know we've got to move 
Move 

We'll party every day 
And give you all of my pay 
And all I can do pretty baby 
Is get on my knees and pray 

Hey baby you can't leave me this way 
But I want to tell you 
That I ought to make it today 
Tell me 
Baby tell me 
You know I feel so bad 
I just can't take it 
You know I feel so bad 

We'll party every day 
And give you all of my pay 
And all I can do pretty baby 
Is get on my knees and pray 

Come on honey and let's make it 
I just can't take it no more 
Let's make it
