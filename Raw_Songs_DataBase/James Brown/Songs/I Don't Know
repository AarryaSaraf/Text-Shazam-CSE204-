Oh I don't know...

Yes tell me baby 
Whatever I did wrong 
When I left pretty baby 
Did I stay too long 
You said I, I don't know

Now baby why did you put me down 
I didn't think there was anybody 
Who could take my place when I was around 
I tried to do my best 
As nice as I could 
But still you insist 
I didn't do what I should 
Now you just can't make a fool of everybody 
'Cause at the end 
Somebody gonna double cross you 
Gonna be your best friend 
One thing's for sure 
Was wherever you go 
You can always say 
I don't know 

I don't know 

Yes tell me baby 
Was it my best friend 
That loved you when I left 
And you keep lovin' him 'til the end 
You said I... 
I don't know 
I don't know
