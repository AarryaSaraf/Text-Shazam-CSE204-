Ow!

I can't stand it when you hold my man
I can't stand it when you call me a natural born lover man
I can't love you when say, "Baby, please don't go"
I don't to, baby, 'cause I want some more
I said love me, baby, love me like you never, never never did before
Kiss me, squeeze, me, huh, make me want some more
'Cause you know that I need ya, ha
You know I need ya
You know that I need ya
You know that I, that I, that I, I said I need ya
Hey, I need ya
Now, band, can you make dirty? Can you make it burn, band?
Can you make it funky? Can you, can you, ah...

Come on down
Ha, get it, band, come on, do it
Band, tell me can you make it funky funk
Come on, band, can you...
Will you make it funky if you know you got the funky song?
Baby, baby baby baby baby baby baby baby, please don't go
I can't stand it when you touch my heart
I can't stand it 'cause I need a brand new start
I said my body's warm, temperature's going up
Got to, got to...
Baby, baby baby, baby baby
Woman, woman, woman, woman, woman such a good thing
I said woman, you a good thing
Said woman, you a good thing
Woman, you a good thing
Woman, you a good thing
Woman, you a good thing
Woman, ha

Tell me that you know you want my lovin'
Tell me can you want me, do it, do you love me?

Baby, can you make it funky now?
Baby, can you make it funky now?
