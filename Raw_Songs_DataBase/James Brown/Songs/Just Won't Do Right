Since you've been gone
I drink & gamble every night 
You just won't do right 

Tell me...
Am I the one 

Tell me...
Am I the one 

Tell me, tell me, am I the one
Since you've been gone I've been all alone
Waiting and watching for you
My heart is trying slowly bye and bye
Still, still for you

Since you've been gone
I drink & gamble every night
You just won't do right
