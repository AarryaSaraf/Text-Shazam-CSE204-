Alright
Hard times, hard times
Oh, ain't got no money to pay my bills
Wanna have some fun, keep my lovin' still
I refuse to lose, oh, I refuse to lose

Need more lovin', I need it bad
Recall the good times I used to have
But I refuse to lose, I refuse to lose
Take it up, I refuse to lose
Said I refuse to lose, get down

Don't want nobody to bother me 'cause I refuse to lose

Said I refuse to lose, oh yeah, I refuse to lose
Get down

And let the good times roll, and let the good times roll
Sock it in the pocket, ha ha, and let the good times roll
Sock it in the pocket, ha, and let the good times roll

Get it in the pocket and let the good times roll
Sock it in the pocket, ha ha, and let the good times roll
Rock it in the pocket, ha, and let the good times roll
Come on and dance, dance, dance, dance, and let the good times roll
Come on and dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, and let the good times roll, ha

Come on and dance, dance, dance, dance, and let the good times roll
Hit it again, ow...

I miss my girl and I need her bad
But I refuse to lose, I refuse to lose
Times are rough and money's short
I lost the things that I thought I bought
But I refuse to lose, I refuse to lose
I refuse to lose, said I refuse to lose
I refuse to lose, said I refuse to lose
Get down, get down

Hey, uh, good God
Sock it in the pocket, St. Pinck, get in the pocket, Pinck
Sock it in the pocket, you did it
Make it squeal, Pinck

Sock it in the pocket, get in the pocket
Sock it in the pocket, get in the pocket
Need it in the pocket, need it in the pocket
Get it in the pocket, sock it in the pocket
Sock it in the pocket, get it in the pocket

Float like a butterfly and sting like a bee
