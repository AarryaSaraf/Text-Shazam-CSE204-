Come on, bring it! Lay it on me!
I don't care, alright, about your past, dig it
I just want, hey! My love to last, come on
I don't care, hit me band, about your faults, huh!
I just want to satisfy your thoughts, hey!

Come on! When you kiss me, hold my hand
Make me understand, hey! One more time
I break out, huh! In a cold sweat, yiii!

Get down, uh! Get on down, get on down! Come on!
I don't care, alright, about your wants
I just want to tell you, baby, about the do's and don'ts
Huh! I don't care about the way you treat me, darlin'

Uh! Ahhh, when you kiss me, yeah, and ya miss me
Hold my hand, it makes me understand
I break out... in a cold sweat, hey!

Get down, come on! Get it, get it, get it!
Baby baby baby, come on! Do it, do it, do it, uh!
Go right home, come on! Get it, get it! Come on...
