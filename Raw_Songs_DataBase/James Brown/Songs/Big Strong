They say love ain't nothin' but the blues
Everybody got the blues sometimes
They say that love ain't nothin' but the blues
And everybody got the blues sometimes
Come on over here, try me, baby
Get a taste of this blues of mine

I wanna know do you know what it means to be in love?
Do you know what it means to be mistreated day and night?
Do you, do you, do you know what it means to be in love?
Do you know what it means to be mistreated day and night?
Most of all, when you love someone
You always take the wrong instead of the right
And all I wanna ask ya, plenty blues
