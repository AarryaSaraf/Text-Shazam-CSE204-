I know you're sick and tired, baby
Of the old things that I do
In 1975, I tried to love you
In the only way that I knew
But when I woke up this morning, I finally realized
That you needed something new to keep me satisfied

Got a new kiss for you, baby
In this year of '77
Baby, got a new kiss for you, sugar
It'll take you straight on into Heaven

I know, I know, I know that life has been miserable for you, sugar
In this past year or two, in a year or two
But I would never, never, never, never, never, never neglect you
I just didn't know what to do
But when I woke up this morning and finally realized
That you needed something new to keep you, oh, by my side

Got a new kiss for you, sugar
A brand new kiss
Mmm, got a new kiss for you, sugar
Cheek to cheek, toe to toe
Got a new kiss for you, baby
It'll last forever, forever, forever
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
New kiss for you, darlin'
It'll last, it'll last, always, forever
Got a new kiss, baby, baby, baby baby baby
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my darling
Oh, got a new kiss for you, baby
It's all, it's all, it's all that I need for you
