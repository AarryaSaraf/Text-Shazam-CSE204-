What the world needs now is love, sweet love
That's the only thing in my opinion it's not enough of
What the world needs now is love, sweet love
That's the only thing we don't have enough of

Ah, Lord, we don't need another mountain
There are mountains and hillsides enough to climb
There are oceans, rivers enough to cross
And last 'til the end of time... yeah

Oh, what the world needs now is love, sweet love
That's the only thing... play it! We don't have enough of
What the world needs now is just a lil' bit of love
That's the only thing, that we just don't have enough of

Ah, Lord, we don't need another mountain
There are mountains and hillsides enough to climb
There are oceans and rivers enough to cross
Enough, 'til... last 'til the end of time, ah, sing it

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ha-ha
'Til the end of time, sing it

What the world needs now - so-oh-oh, so much love
That's the only thing we just don't have enough of
Dr. King wanted love, John F. Kennedy wanted love
Robert Kennedy wanted love, you and I want...
Oh, oh, waaaoow... Lord, have mercy
We need a little bit of love
Love your children, love one another...
