Sweet thing, you're dead now
You're dead, yeah
You're out cold, but live on
Now, now at Christmas time, and the whole year round
Right on, right on
Look here, sweet thing, let me explain myself, baby
When I say "you're dead," I mean you're really out of sight
Out of sight, totally together
But you let me down now, you didn't even defend yourself
You didn't defend yourself
And you left me like, oh no, I can't say this on record
But I'ma try to write this little old letter and let you dig my little old rap
It starts like this, listen to it
For what it's worth, for what it could mean to you and I both, later on:

Dear sweet thing, fox, all the beautiful things, all the little names that I give you
I sit here so aggravated and bewildered because you didn't, you know, you didn't come home
You didn't come straight back to me last night
No fussin', no fightin', no nothin', you just up and split with another cat
Of course, I found out later he was your friend
And this much, this morning, I was able, I was able to understand that
After a very hectic night, you can dig the night was long
Now, I made it clear as possible, as possibly I could say it
Baby, don't go to strangers, come on home to me
Now, it's true, it's true, this is a man's world
But it wouldn't be nothin' without your kind
That I see now, after 24 hours of sufferin', tears, cold sweat

Why does my girl always have to be
The one to go south and go away from me?
And leave me stringing on a tree, dangling on a string
That's alright, I'ma be there when you come back
But I'm gon' give you this little old rap so we can get this together
Since you gon', you know, smoke it in a pipe
But understand what I'm sayin', I want you to know where I'm comin' from
Now, like, I have a right, you know, to like come on with this old
Aggravated or antagonizing rap because I feel a little down
But I think you gon' make it alright 'cause you're just together that way
Now, baby, can't you be conscious of like every moment in the day and night
And let all of our moves be for each other? Together, you know
And completely out of sight, completely out of sight in every way
And how can I explain it when we live and concentrate on being happy 100 percent
In mellow tone, however
Yes, I know sometimes that you aren't mellow
But, you know, deep down inside I know you're mellow people
Well, at least, not as mellow as I hope you would be sometime
But you know how to do something about that, too
'Cause you're just too good to be anything but you
Now, I'm still, I'm still willing to help for, let's say, help each other
And I don't care what it take, even if we have to sleep in a tent
As long as I know that we are close together and that vibrations of your love and affection
And the warmth of you is there

Can't you see that this opportunity comes once in a lifetime?
Sometimes I wanna know, are you livin' in a past time?
Pastime things right before your eyes, you know
Well, sometimes it just seems it's impossible for you to see
You're not blind, you know, you're just hardheaded, stubborn, but that's alright
Those are the sweet things that makes you you, and I wouldn't take nobody else but you

You let my flame go out last night
You let my flame go out
You know, I don't expect, like, you can sleep James Brown or you can sleep your man
But since I'm your man, you can even sleep me, James Brown
That's what we're talking about, we're not talking about John Doe
Maybe Johnny Terry or somebody, or Bobby Byrd
We're talking about me and you, or you and I
You wanna be, you know, but saying me and you makes it close, you know
I can feel you that way
That's alright, just take your time
