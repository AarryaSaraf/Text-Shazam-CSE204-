I'm Mama Feelgood, I'm Mama Feelgood

I can make my lover reach for the stars when the sun is out
And I can make my man forget what he's thinkin' about
Now when my lover gotta have it, he don't need a thriller
But if he wants some lovin', I can be a painkiller

In other words what I'm tryin' to say is don't be a teaser
Be a love pleaser, be a love pleaser

Be a love pleaser, forget about the others and all the rest
Whatever you be, gotta be the best

It's time for everybody to get ahold to yourself
You see life is too short and I'm afraid we just don't have enough time left
'Cause that's why they call me Mama Feelgood, 'cause I do my thang
And I'm telling you it's about time you started doing it too

I can make my lover reach for the stars when the sun is out
Men, let me hear you say somethin'
Guitar, let me hear you spank it

I can take a four dollar dress and let off the funky heels
I can look plump and if he wants I can look slim

I'm Mama Feelgood, Mama Feelgood I'm Mama Feelgood
I'm Mama Feelgood, Feelgood, Mama Feelgood, Feelgood

I can pull up this suit, do anything, yes I can
And I can stand behind him and make him feel like a man
He knows I can, and that makes him even more of a man

I'm Mama Feelgood, Mama Feelgood
