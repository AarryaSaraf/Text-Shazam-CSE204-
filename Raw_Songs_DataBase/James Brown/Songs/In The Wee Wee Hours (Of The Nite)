Just hold me in your arms
That's where I belong
In your arms, that's where I belong

In the wee wee hours of the night
That's when our love get real tight
I don't wanna be wrong
No, but tell me, you got to be right

Hey, I said love is a many splendored thing
With all the happiness it brings
In the wee hours of the night
That's when our love get real tight
I don't wanna be wrong
No, then tell me you gotta be right, no no

Hey, I said love is a many splendored thing
With all the happiness it brings
