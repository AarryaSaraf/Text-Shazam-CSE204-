Darlin' I know I fell
But what could I do
I've had one chance
Now I'm askin' for two
Don't make me suffer
Don't make me suffer
I promise I try
Don't send me away
It's a matter of pride
Forgive me
Please, forgive me
Honey, forgive me
I love you
And that's no lie
You've been mistreated
I've got no alibi
But I'm gonna show you
There's a brighter day
I'll prove I love you
Every second of the day
Just forgive me
Baby, forgive me
Forgive me
As I stand alone
With the state of my heart
Won't you come back, baby
Let's make a new start
I would call on Cupid
If I thought I could
If I could, he'd help
I know, I know he would
Alright now
Just forgive me
Baby, forgive me

Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Darlin' I know I fell
But what could I do
I had one chance
Now I'm askin' for two
Don't make me suffer
Don't make me suffer
Don't make me suffer
I promise I try
Don't send me away
It's a matter of pride
Forgive me
You just listen to me
Forgive me
Step right down
Forgive me
Forgive me
Do you hear now
I said I love you
And that's no lie
You've been mistreated
I've got no alibi
But I'm gonna show you
There's a brighter day
I'll prove I love you
Every second of the day
Just forgive me
Darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'
Forgive me
Forgive me
Lord have mercy
As I stand alone
With the state of my heart
Won't you come back, baby
And let's make a new start
I would call on Cupid
If I thought I could
If I could, he'd help
I know, I know, I know he would now
Say it one more time
I would call on Cupid
If I thought I could
If he could help
You know I know he would
Just forgive me
Darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'
Forgive me
Forgive me
Tell me...
Good God
Forgive me
Sometime I sit down and I wonder, now
Alright
I sit down and I wonder, now
I sit down and I wonder, baby
Baby, baby, I sit down and I wonder, now
I sit down and I wonder, now
Baby - baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Forgive me
Alright now
Forgive me, now
