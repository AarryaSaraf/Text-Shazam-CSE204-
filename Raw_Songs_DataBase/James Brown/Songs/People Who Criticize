Let's party
Look, here comes the man
To show you where's it at
All you lightweights back up
Good God, let's party
Got a message for ya
Here's looking at ya

Alright, there are some people
Getting their thrills from telling lies
Ain't got nothing to do
But get down and signify
I got something
That they can't beat
Lookie here, I mean some funky stuff
So sweet

People who criticize
Sympathize
Get their kicks from confidence

Lookie here
When they get down
You can't get up
Need somebody

Can't get over
Need somebody to 
Need some help, yeah
Need some help, yeah
Need some help
Don't know how to do their thing without help from me
Good God, hit me

People who criticize
Sympathize
Sacrifice, God Almighty

Got me satisfied

Good God
