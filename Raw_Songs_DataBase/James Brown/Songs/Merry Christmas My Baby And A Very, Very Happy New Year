If a bell could ring
And make the whole world sing
Be cheerful about the rest
And always be the rest
'Cause restitution is the test

So be merry with gentle care
Merry Christmas, my baby
And a very, very, very Happy New Year

If a star could gleam
And make all the jewels seem
Like rocks made of gold
Excuse me, people, for being so bold
But I've got blood, sweat and tears in my soul

So be merry with gentle care
Merry Christmas, my baby
And a very, very, very Happy New Year

I love the way you wiggle your hips around the Christmas tree
I love the way you do those sassy mama things to me
I love someone who can be nice and gentle, and sweet and kind
So come on, make me happy this New Year

If a bell could ring
And make the whole world sing
Be cheerful about the rest and
Always be the best
'Cause restitution is the test

So be merry with gentle care
Merry Christmas, my baby
And a very, very, very Happy New Year

A very Happy New Year
A very Happy New Year

If a star could gleam
And makes all the jewels seem
Like rocks made of gold, ha ha
Excuse me, people for being so bold
