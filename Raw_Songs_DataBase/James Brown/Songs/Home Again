Well, I, I got myself together
And I know just where I'm, I'm coming from, oh yeah
Well, I, got myself together
And I know just where I'm coming from, oh yeah
That's where I'm going back, baby
To my rightful home

It ain't no harm to have the blues
It ain't no harm to let it all hang out
Oh, it ain't no harm to have the blues
Ain't no harm to let it all hang out, oh no
That's what I mean about being truthful and being so real
And that's what it's, and that's what it's all about
Can I get a little horns to follow me right here?
Makes me wanna say mmm...mmm...oh no
Mmm-hmm...oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, hey baby, mmm-hmm, oh no
Mmm baby, oh baby, oh baby
Now Jimmy, take me on up, give me a solo, Jimmy
Take one up to B-flat

Take me back home now...

Sit down and I wonder, what in the world gonna become of me
I sit down and I wonder...
