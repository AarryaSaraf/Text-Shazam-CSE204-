// In The Ghetto //

As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto
People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way

Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto

And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto

As her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto

// Games People Play //

Oh the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now
Never saying what they mean
Oh they whine away the hours
In their ivory towers
Til they're covered up with flowers
In the back of a black limousine

La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play

Oh they make one another cry
Break their hearts and they say good-bye
Cross their heart and they hope to die
That the other was to blame
Neither one will ever give in
So they gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' 'bout the way it might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame

La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play

Oh they teach how to meditate
Read your horoscope and teach you faith
The furthermore the hell with hate
Come on and get on board
Look around and tell me what you see
What's a-happenin' to you and to me
God grant me the serenity
To just remember who I am

La la la mmm da da da
La la la mmm da da dee
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
And the games people play

// 'Til Death Do Us Part //

[Spoken:]
Today you told me that you'd found another
And you took off your golden wedding band
The one you vowed you'd wear until death do us part
When I kissed it and placed it on your hand
A wreath will hang upon the door tomorrow
Of the little house that we once called our home
And friends will stop and hang their heads in sorrow
To pay the last respects to one gone on

Tonight I lay me down to sleep forever
With this small empty bottle and broken heart
I keep the vow I made I won't forsake it
I promised to death do us part

Will you bring your new love to the chapel
To look upon the one that you betrayed
Will you bring me pretty flowers like you used to
And replace them in my hands where I lay

Will you cry and think of happy mem'ries
That we shared together at the start
And will you look upon me and remember
the day we said till death do us part

// Big Wind //

Big wind big wind's comin'
From daylight till dusk we've been a workin' in the dust
Pickin' cotton workin' side by side
Oh I can't forget I still remember yet the way my daddy looked at me and cried
Big wind's a comin' listen to the hummin' hurry up now be quick don't stall
You know we can't be slow take the kids and get below
If we don't hurry it'll surely get us all

I ran across the field so scared my lips was scaled
To warn my mom to storm was on its way
Now I knew I'd won the race when I'd see my mama's face
And the way she looked at me and said
Big wind's a comin'...

Oh but dad was on the cellar and by now the sky was yellow
The wind was blowin' trees were fallin'
And outside I heard him cryin' and as he lay there dyin'
It seemed I could still hear him sayin'
Big wind's a comin'...
Big wind big wind's comin'

// Evening Shade //

My train of thought was broken by a sudden burst of laughter
Something badly needed to brighten up the chores
Seemed old Mrs. Bailey had accidentally fell
In the water being used to scrub the floors
Now Mrs. Bailey was the meanest matron at the home
She believed in lots of work with little play
And we laughed till we bent double
Though we knew we'd get in trouble
But trouble's all we had at evening shade
Now evening shade was where they claim to teach you understanding
To teach you love and keep you off the streets
And all the kids that live here are said to be a problem
Juvenile delinquents so to speak

But understanding isn't learned from punishment and anger
An iron has no gentle touch and love ain't learned from hate
The reason we were here is 'cause we had no one who cared
But they cared even less at evening shade

Little Susan Bradley, one night had wet her bed
Mrs. Bailey took the razor strap and beat her half to death
And I knew that something must be done to put an end to this
And so I started talking plans with the older kids

Plans were that Joe Johnson would steal the kerosene
And I would get some matches when nobody seen
Beckie Adams would make sure the kids were all outside
Billy Watson would look out for the evil eye

Now Mrs. Bailey took a nap at three o'clock each day
We knew that she'd be a'sleeping as the plans got underway
Now that its all over and the sun is going down
There's no evening shade 'cause we burned it to the ground

// I'm Fed Up With You //

I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
You say that wasn't you I saw with someone else last night
You say you've never done me wrong you've always treated me right
I know it was dark but not that dark and I'm not that blind
And I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
I'm fed up with you and the way that you do
I used to love you now I change my mind
And I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
I once believed everything you've said I was so in love with you
You said I was the only one now I know that wasn't true
Now I know just where I stand I'm tidin' your cheatin' line
And I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line
I'm fed up with you...
I'm fed up with you feedin' me a line

// Daddy //

Daddy I feel that I must talk to you
Are you sure this is what you want to do?
Now it's not for us kids that I beg you to stay
Please don't just walk out on Mama this way
She's mothered your children, she's spent her whole life
Trying to be a good mother and wife
And she stood by you when the rest let you down
Daddy, how can you walk out on her now?

I'm your oldest daughter, my age twenty-three
Your new love is even younger than me
She's young, she's pretty, her hands soft as dew
While Mama's are withered from working for you

Mom's not young any more like your new love
But your new love won't love you like my mama does
You've taken her best years, so don't leave her now
Please, Daddy say that you won't let her down

// We Had All The Good Things Going //

It wasn't very long ago
We had a love few people know
And everything was going oh so fine
I trusted you, you trusted me
The way that it's supposed to be
But love slipped from us somewhere down the line

We had all of the good things going baby
You know we did, everything was fine
Enjoying the taste of the good life
We all look for but few can find

It's gone but we can't understand
How luck could slip right through our hands
All down the line things seemed so very right
The love we shared through all these years
We both knew that we were sincere
Then suddenly it left just overnight

We had all of the good things going baby
You know we did, everything was fine
Enjoying the taste of the good life
We all look for but few can find

Now that we've gone our separate ways
I still recall those brighter days
Days that didn't seem so very long
Neither of us ought to blame
We overly know that it's a shame
And all that we had going now is gone

We had all of the good things going baby
You know we did, everything was fine
Enjoying the taste of the good life
We all look for but few can find

// The Monkey's Tale //

Oh the monkey's had a better tale than you
Compare to yours all their tales sound so true
The way you're actin' seems to me at all the monkey should go free
You're the one that should be locked up in the Zoo

When I married you I thought you were a man
But you're the biggest ape that's living in this land
I'd like to run you up a tree for the way you lie to me
Your swingin' round is gettin' out of hand
Oh the monkey's had...

Every monkey has its day so go ahead and play
Make your plans and tell your lies and stick to them
But from now on I remind you can wag your tail behind you
Cause you finally got yourself out on a limb

[Banjo]

Every monkey has its day...
Oh the monkey's had a better tale than you

// Gypsy, Joe And Me //

We might have slept in a rail yard or camped by the river bank
We fed ourselves from the fruit of the land
And quenched our thirst with rain
We never did allow no roots to grow beneath our feet
Life just had no pattern for Gypsy Joe and me
All we had was each other and the rags upon our back
The closest thing to a home we new was some abandoned shack
But we had all we needed and the rest we didn't need
Life was free and simple for Gypsy Joe and me
Now Gypsy was my little dog, I found by the road in a ditch
And so I named him Gypsy, cause that name just seemed to fit
Oh and Joe he was my man, the flower of my soul
Thou he never said he loved me, I just always seemed to know
While standing by the highway, thumbin' for a ride
The speeding wheels of a passing car, took Gypsy's life
I lost him where I found him and his loss was misery
Now there's no more Gypsy, there's just Joe and me

Well the winter came and the snow did fall
And the night was cold and still
And the rags we wore were not enough
And Joe he caught the chill
And he told me how he loved me
And in my arms he went to sleep
Now there's no more Gypsy, no more Joe, there's just me

While standin' here on the edge of this bridge
Lookin' down I see
The face of Joe and Gypsy, lookin' back at me
And somewhere in the distance I can hear them callin' me
Tonight we'll be together again
Gypsy, Joe and me

// Home For Pete's Sake //

I became a woman of the world cause I was fed up with the farm
And I thought pretty clothes and city lights
Running round both day and night could do no harm
A party girl I mixed for bout myself into a fix for running wild
So I wrote my dad and mom asked if I could come back home to have my child
I received the letter from the folks back home and they said things were fine
They went on to say that Pete the boy I broke up with was about to lose his mind
But I couldn't hardly read the rest the words were being bloted by my tears
I'm feelin' so ashamed he loved me then he feels the same he still cares
So I'm going home for Pete's sake it was I who broke his heart in the first place
If he'll try me one more time for then I've made up my mind
And in the morning I'm going home for Pete's sake
Yes for Pete's sake my baby's and mine
