Album: TogetherAlways

// Together Always //

You and I have been together for a long long time
And we vowed that we would stay together always
Life at times has been unpleasant
Down the trails where fate has led us
But we pray that God will let us be together always

Together together
Together always you and me
Forever and ever
Together always you and me

Through the years our love will multiply and be divided
By the children added to enrich our lives
God's been good to you and I
And in heaven there's eternal life
Beyond this world where you and I will be together always

Together together
Together always you and me
Forever and ever
Together always you and me

Together together
Together always you and me
Forever and ever
Together always you and me

Together together...

// Love's All Over //

I can see it on your face
It's over, it's all over, it's all over me and you
Love came down like the rains from heaven
Love's all over us dripping like the morning dew

We can't hide it anymore, you can't hide real love
When it's all over all over me and you
And it's wonderful to know it's all over
Love, sweet love, it's all over me and you

Once we worried what folks would think if they only knew
Just how much love there was between me and you
Oh, but it's no secret anymore it's all out in plain view
And love's all over us love's all over me and you

We can't hide it anymore, you can't hide real love
When it's all over all over me and you
And it's wonderful to know it's all over
Love, sweet love, it's all over me and you

// Christina //

Christina, our first born, you are so soft and warm
As you lie between us softly sleeping
We gaze in admiration at God's tiny creation
And thank him and ask for your safekeeping

You were conceived through love, you are a part of us
Christina, you are a dream come true
We'll place you in God's hands and place you in our plans
Christina, we'll take good care of you

And as we watch you grow, we will always let you know
How much we love you, Christina
We'll take pride in all you do and we will always stand by you
Because we love you, Christina, Christina

You made our house a home, brought joy we've never known
Christina, we love you so
With innocence sweet and fair blue eyes and angel hair
Through the years we'll watch you as you grow

We'll hold your little hand we'll love you all we can
We'll try to teach you right from wrong
You are God's gift to us, we can't thank Him enough
For letting us have you for our own

And as we watch you grow, we will always let you know
How much we love you, Christina
We'll take pride in all you do and we will always stand by you
Because we love you Christina, Christina

// Take Away //

We don't take away one happy moment
We won't take away any of the new
We'll do anything to make each other happy
Love is give and take, but we don't take away

I never thought that love could make you feel so happy
I thought I'd found love once, but I wasn't even close
Well, you make me wanna call you sweet names at the waking of each day
'Cause each day I love you more and we won't never take away

We don't take away one happy moment
We won't take away any of the new
We'll do anything to make each other happy
Love is give and take but we don't take away
Love is give and take but we don't take away, take away, mhm

// Ten Four, Over And Out //

10-4 over and out
The way we talk sometimes you'd think our love is filled with doubt
But when we're all alone by the fireside of our home
The angry words we spoke that day have forever gone away
Then it's love we talk about
To the world outside we say "10-4 over and out"

Hello, this is Unit 2 callin' Unit 1
This is Unit 2 tryin' Unit 1
Do you read me Unit 1 do you read me?
Yeah, I read you Unit 2
I sure can read you just like a book is all
And I know what you called for I know what you're gonna say
I'm gonna be a little bit late
Well, I know you're a little bit late's are usually two or three or four
Or sometimes even more hours long
And I am sick and tired of it
10-4 over and out

10-4 over and out
The way we talk sometimes you'd think our love is filled with doubt
But when we're all alone by the fireside of our home
The angry words we spoke that day have forever gone away
Then it's love we talk about
To the world outside we say 10-4 over and out

This is Unit 1 callin' Unit 2
Do you read me Unit 2?
You better answer me Unit 2
I'm gettin' sick of foolin' around with this CB radio
I'm gonna cram this thing down your throat
I read you... mhm, do I golly
I read you Unit 1 loud and clear
But seems like there's a little turbulence on the line
Honey, I'm sorry that I'm runnin' so late but I stopped off here
To see this friend of mine who's been awfully awfully sick
And when I got back to the car you know
This radio had run my battery down
I know it's hard for you to believe
Oh, I believe you, I really do believe you
I'll CB-in' you
10-4 over and out

10-4 over and out
The way we talk sometimes you'd think our love is filled with doubt
But when we're all alone by the fireside of our home
The angry words we spoke that day have forever gone away
Then it's love we talk about
To the world outside we say 10-4 over and out

10-4, baby
I'm gonna have to be clear with you
I'm always movin' on
Oh, you've never been clear in your life you was born
I'm gonna get rid of this radio it's gonna get me killed I tell you
I'm gonna have to get rid of that radio just as soon as we get home
Everybody in the country knows what we're talkin' about too
They listenin' on us I know I know

// Lost Forever In Your Kiss //

This is not at all like me I never thought that I could be
So overcome by anyone like this
But you caught me by surprise caught me before I realize
Now I am lost forever in your kiss

So take me if you want me love me if you will
For you have all control of me and I am yours until
Till you say that you don't want me, oh, I hope that never will be
For I'm lost forever in your kiss

You're on my mind constantly, oh, and this is all so new to me
And when you reach for me I can't resist
For I've become a part of you and I'll do anything you want me to
For I am lost forever in your kiss

So take me if you want me love me if you will
For you have all control of me and I am yours until
Till you say that you don't want me, oh, I hope that never will be
For I'm lost forever in your kiss

// Anyplace You Want To Go //

Crushed velvet drapes the walls of the room
Pillows all colors shapes and sizes on the floor
Mirrors on the ceiling reflect the candles burning low
Just close your eyes and travel anyplace you want to go

To lover's lane
Or far away to the mountain peaks of Spain
Cruise along the Amazon where the deep blue waters flow
Our imagination will take us anyplace we want to go

Though we can only go there in our minds
'Cause we cannot afford such luxuries so kind
The little room we live in is not much we both know
But the dreams we share can take us anyplace we want to go

Tonight we'll go to some majestic island
Ride the waves when the tide is rising
Lying in the silver sands where gentle breezes blow
The beauty of our love can take anyplace we want to go

To lover's lane
Or far away to the mountain peaks of Spain
Cruise along the Amazon where the deep blue waters flow
Our imagination will take us anyplace we want to go

Anyplace we want to go

// Looking Down //

They say the love we steal is a disgrace
That we should be ashamed to look the world in the face
But they don't know how much love we must hide
While the world looks down upon our pride

Seems there's always someone looking down down down
Not knowing inner feelings of the ones they're puttin' down
The love we feel is as true as a baby's crying sound
Still there's always someone looking down

We still honor the vows we made long ago
But when there's no love at home it hurts us so
And then your heart begins to look around
Love found us, now the world's a-looking down

Seems there's always someone looking down down down
Not knowing inner feelings of the ones they're puttin' down
The love we feel is true as a baby's crying sound
Still there's always someone looking down

The love we must keep silent hurts us now
But love will always find a way somehow
'Til then the world will look at us and frown
But we'll love each other while they're looking down

Seems there's always someone looking down down down
Not knowing inner feelings of the ones they're puttin' down
The love we feel is as true as a baby's crying sound
Still there's always someone looking down
Seems there's always someone looking down

// You And Me, Her And Him //

You and me and her and him must get together
And see if maybe we can find a way
To put an end to hurting one another
'Cause he don't and she don't know
How much we hurt each day

It's not fair and you and I both know it
To have to hide and love the way we do
The time is now that we must get together
Her and him, me and you

She and I had lost it long before I met you
We tried and tried but all the love had gone
And I guess respect is all that's kept me with him
Cause there hasn't been no love there in so long

It's not fair and you and I both know it
To have to hide and love the way we do
The time is now that we must get together
Her and him, me and you
