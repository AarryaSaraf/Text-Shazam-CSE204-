// Will He Be Waiting //

I can still see that lonesome road stretched out before me
The road that left me out of his love
I can still feel the tears he cried on my shoulder the day that I told him goodbye
I never should have left him never should have gone oh what a crazy fool I've been
Will he be waiting for me he will be won't he and will he take me back again
Shadows from the streets shade the path that I am walking
As I make my way back up that winding road again
And the smell of my tomorrow fills the air with sweet perfume
My heart beats faster as I'm near my journey're end
I wonder if he's missed me I wonder if he wants me I wonder does he love me still
Will he be waiting for me he will be won't he oh how I hope he will
He will be waiting for me he will be won't he
How could it be his love for me has faded and has died
He will be waiting for me he will be won't he
Oh will I find that this time I'll be the one to cry
Will he be waiting for me

// The Greatest Days Of All //

A dirt dobber built its nest
On my only Sunday dress
And the roof leaked in my shoes
And when they dried they were too small
And the rats chewed a great big hole
In my only winter coat
And at night I'd hear them gnaw
The paper on my bedroom wall
But I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
Some happy and some sad
Some good and some bad
But I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
I used to wait by the garden gate
Where the hummingbirds came ev'ry day
To kiss the yellow roses
Growing up the garden wall
And in the tall grass I would lie
'Til ev'ning shadows brought the night
Thru the window of my room
I'd hear the whippoorwill's sad call
And I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
Some happy and some sad
Some good and some bad
But I still say
Those were the greatest days of all

Now as I make my way
Along the busy city sidewalks
My head arouring from the deafening city sound
You can't hear a whipporwill in this noisy city
And tall green grass don't grow
Along the sidewalks of this town
And hummingbirds don't fly around
These artificial roses
Like they did around the garden wall
And, oh, so often in my mind
I'll go back to another time
And I still say
Those were the greatest days of all
I still say
Those were the greatest days of all

// Touch Your Woman //

We can't always both be right
We sometimes disagree
But you've got the right to speak your mind
An' it's the same with me
When the anger's at an end
And you want inside my arms again
All you have to do to make it right is just

Touch your woman
Touch your woman
Everything's gonna be alright
Touch your woman
Touch your woman
Let me know, let me know everything's alright

There are times when I should be strong
When I'm awfully weak
When the sudden blows of life have brought me to my knees
Woman needs a helpin' hand
Needs someone to understand
Needs the man she loves to help her stand, so

Touch your woman
Touch your woman
Everything's gonna be alright
Touch your woman
Touch your woman
Let me know, let me know everything's alright

And when the busy day is done
You lay by my side
You know exactly what it takes to keep me satisfied
You know exactly what I need and I always go to sleep in peace
Thanking God that you belong to me, so

Touch your woman
Touch your woman
Everything's gonna be alright
Touch your woman
Touch your woman
Let me know, let me know everything's alright

// A Lot Of You Left In Me //

Oh you took your sweet love from me oh you left me sweet sweet memories
And I cry I cry like a little baby cause there's still a lot of you left in me
Oh there's still a lot of you left in me and I cry cause your love'll set me free
Your love'll set me free
I'll keep holding on to love that used to be cause there's still a lot of you left in me

Oh I still go on to all our favorite places and I still see all our friends we used to see
Oh but I'm thinkin' now I'm just not the same without you
And that there's still a lot of you left in me
Oh there's still a lot of you...
Cause there's still a lot of you left in me

// Second Best //

(Though I'm only second best you're still first with me)
I tried to make you love me I've done everything I could
I thought if I tried long enough maybe someday that you would
But there was someone else before me and it's her you're lovin' still
And I know no matter what I'd do I'm only second best
Only second best that's all I will ever be
Even though I'm second best you're still first with me
And I'll be loving you when they fall my hand I guess
I love you even though I know I'm only second best

I know you've tried to love me and I'd hope you would in time
I know that when you're holding me it's her that's on your mind
Now I know you can't get over her but I love you nonless
But it makes no difference what I'd do I'm only second best
Only second best...
I love you even though I know I'm only second best
