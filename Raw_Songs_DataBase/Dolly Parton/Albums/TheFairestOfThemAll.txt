Album: TheFairestOfThemAll

// Daddy Come And Get Me //

In this mental institution, lookin' out through these iron bars
How could he put me in here, how could he go that far
Yes I need help but not this kind, he didn't love me from the start
But it's not my mind that's broken, it's my heart
Oh Daddy come and get me and take me home with you
I'm depending on you Daddy, there's nothing I can do
And you said that I could come to you if I ever was in need
But Daddy I can't come to you, you'll have to come to me

When he said he loved another, I was crazy with jealousy
That's 'cause I was crazy over him and I couldn't stand to set him free
And I couldn't stand to lose him and I cried and cried for days
And he said that I was crazy but he just put me in here to get me out of his way
Daddy come and get me

Oh Daddy come and get me and take me home with you
I'm depending on you Daddy 'cause there's nothing else I can do
And you said that I could come to you if I ever was in need
But Daddy I can't come to you, you'll have to come to me

Oh Daddy, come and get me

// Chas //

Chas I cook your a breakfast and send you to work
I mend your clothes Chas I iron your shirts
There's so much thought in each thing that I do
And all of the time Chas I'm loving you
And I greet you each evening Chas when you come home
I miss you so badly while you are gone
And if I make you happy then I'm happy too and all of the time Chas I'm loving you
Chas I rock your babies I teach them to talk
I care for your wife Chas because she can't walk
I do all the things she's unabled to do and all of the time Chas I'm loving you
I want you so much but your wife need you Chas
You'll never be mine and I'll never ask
I know that you love her and I love her too but all of the time Chas I'm loving you
I look at you Chas you look at me but what I am thinking must never be
I love you so much and it's hard to resist
I want you but I I couldn't take you from sis
But all of the time Chas I'm loving you

// When Possession Gets Too Strong //

I can't live with you when you try to own me
Though you may give me love like I have never known
But if you try to control me then you won't never know me
And I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong
So love me just for what I am don't try to change a thing
And I'll take you just like you are and I'll expect the same
So if you want to love me you must understand all of me
For I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong
And I have no control over what I feel inside
And I can't change the way I am and you must be satisfied
So if you think you can't be without place and chance on me
Then I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong

I have no control...
I'll be movin' on when possession gets too strong

// Before You Make Up Your Mind //

Before you make up your mind to leave me
Before you make up your mind to walk out the door
Before you telle me that it's all over
Let me say what I have to say it won't take me all day
And if you still wanna leave don't stay for I won't try to hold you anymore
Does she really love you way that I love you
Does she treat you right even when you've done wrong
If she's woman enough to forgive you way that I'm willing to
If she ain't then don't go for I still love you so we all make mistakes I know
Give these thoughts a little time before you make up your mind

Does she really love you way that I love you
Will she treat you right even when you do wrong
If she's woman enough to forgive you way that I'm willing to
If she ain't then don't go for I still love you so we all make mistakes I know
Give these thoughts a little time before you make up your mind
Give these thoughts a little time before you make up your mind

// I'm Doing This For Your Sake //

Someone else's arms will hold you my darling baby girl
I'll never get to see the child I've brought into this world
Because I made one mistake folks say that I'm bad
But they just don't understand the way I loved your dad
Now I thought your daddy loved me I was so sure he did
And so I gave him all my love and he said we would wed
But I guess he must chenged his mind cause she left town one day
When he found out about you he just stopped and ran away
In this home so far away from home I leave my heart today
Cause home where the heart is and with you my heart will stay
Because I love you so much why I can't make you pay
So I'm doing this for your sake I'm giving you away

// But You Loved Me Then //

Remember all the castles that we once built in the sand
Remember how we used to go and visit fairy land
Remember how we'd search for that pot of gold at the rainbow's end
But you loved me then
And the flowers the we picked from the fields where we did run
And the sunbeams that we'd catch from the summer's golden sun
And the butterflies we'd chase as we'd go running through the wind
But you loved me then
Now I walk through the ruins of our castles in the sand
When you left I lost my way forever and the fairy land
Now the rainbows have all gone and the flowers have all died
And the sunbeams that we caught have all gone free again
And the butterfiles we chased have all gone with the wind
And you no longer care but you love me then
(And you no longer care) but you love me then
(And you no longer care) but you love me then

// Just The Way I Am //

If you hear me crying in the night
Pretend that you don't hear me it's alright
Don't ask me why I'm crying, please don't make a sound
I don't know why, it's just the way I am
And if you think I act a little strange
And you don't understand when I do things
Like running through the fields while the rain is pouring down
I don't know why, it's just the way I am

And even though you may not understand me
I hope that you'll accept me like I am
For there are many sides of me, my mind and spirit must be free
And I might smile when other folks would frown
I don't know why, it's just the way I am

I might go out chasing butterflies
And if I fail to catch one I might cry
And if you want me you might find me in the meadow walking 'round
I don't know why, it's just the way I am

I might be home and busy cleaning house
And in the middle of my work I might go out
And go play games with children at the playground
It makes me happy, and that's just the way I am

And even though you may not understand me
I hope that you'll accept me like I am
For there are childish sides of me
My mind and spirit must be free
I might smile when you think I should frown
I don't know why, it's just the way I am

// More Than Their Share //

I give an inch and you take a mile and you tell me to jump and I just ask how high

I've been over backwards to show you I care
And someone must always give more than their share
I say I'm sorry when the fault is not mine
And I take the blame for our fights all the time
I love you so much and it doesnt seem fair
That someone must always give more than their share
I know you well enough to know you would never admit you were wrong
And you know me well enough to know I give in cause my love is so strong
If I give an inch and you take a mile if you tell me to jump well I just ask how high

I've been over backwards to show you I care
Cause someone must always give more than their share
Yes someone must always give more than their share

// Mammie //

Mammie delivered me into this world
Mammie watched my mama die at my birth
And Mammie she loved me she took me to raise
Mammie was all I had on this earth

Let's get in the firewood, I'd hear Mammie say
Let's go to the spring before it gets dark
And you do up the dishes while the water's still hot
And don't throw that dishwater out in the yard

Oh Mammie taught me how to sing a song
She taught me to play her old guitar
And at night before bedtime we'd sing for hours
As the teakettle whistled along on the fire

And at night as I laid alone in my bed
I'd hear Mammie praying and each night she said
Oh dear God help me raise her to know right from wrong
And I pray she'll do right even after I'm gone.

I'd wait until Mammie had fallen asleep
Then out of my window I'd quietly sneak
And I'd wait by the mill pond according to plans
And there in the darkness I'd meet a man

Oh it's not that I wanted to bring Mammie shame
I just couldn't control wild blood in my veins
They tell me my mama could not name my dad
So I guess it was natural for me to be bad

One night I awoke at the sound of my name
Come quickly, I heard Mammie cry
She said you be good and I told her I would and
That night I watched as my Mammie died

All I have now are the memories of Mammie
And the goodness that loving her brought me
Although she is gone in my heart she lives on
And I know how much good she taught me.

Ah Mammie, I'm being good Mammie ...

// Robert //

Robert's appearance is something to behold
Dressed in the finest of store bought clothes
My mamma sews my clothes cause I'm just a poor girl
But Robert is as real as his daddies gold

Robert could have any girl that he wanted
But his feelings for me each day seems to grow
He don't know the reason, that he's so drawn to me
But there is a story that Robert doesn't know

Oh Robert
Oh Robert

Robert is constantly making eyes at me
He misunderstands the feelings we share
There's no way that I can return his glances
But I know the meaning of the feeling that's there

Robert if you knew, there once was a rich boy
In love with a poor girl, long time ago
But the folks of that rich boy, would not let them marry
And I am a symbol of the love that they stole

Oh Robert
Oh Robert

Robert, oh Robert if you only knew
The same blood is flowing in both me and you
That rich boy's your father, but he's also mine
And my mamma's the poor girl that he left behind

Oh Robert
Oh Robert
