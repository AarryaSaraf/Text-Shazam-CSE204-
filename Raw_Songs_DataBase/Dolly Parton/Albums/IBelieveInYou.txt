// Coat Of Many Colors //

Back through the years I go wanderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
And I recall a box of rags someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use

There were rags of many colors
But every piece was small
I didn't have a coat
And it was way down in the fall

Momma sewed the rags together
Sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors
That I was so proud of

While momma sewed, she told a story
From The Bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors
Joseph wore and then she said

"I hope this coat will bring you
Good luck and happiness"
And I just couldn't wait to wear it
And momma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colors
That my momma made for me
Made only from rags
But I wore it so proudly

And although we had no money
I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
Momma made for me

So with patches on my britches
Holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors
I hurried off to school

Just to find the others laughing
And making fun of me
In my coat of many colors
Momma made for me

And oh I couldn't understand that
'Cause I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love
Momma sewed in every stitch

I even told 'em all the story
Momma told me while she sewed
Why my coat of many colors
Was worth more than all their clothes

They didn't understand it
And I tried to make them see
One is only poor
Only if they choose to be

It's true we had no money
But I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
Momma made for me
'Cause she made it just for me
