Album: Joshua

// Joshua //

Well a good ways down the railroad track
There was this little old rundown shack
And in it lived a man I'd never seen
Folks said he was a mean and a vicious man
And you better not set foot on his land
I didn't think nobody could be that mean
So I took me out walking down the railroad track
I was a-gonna go down to that little old shack
And just find out if all them things I'd heard was true
There was a big black dog laying out in the yard
And it growled at me and I swallowed hard
And I heard somebody say well who are you
Oh and there he stood in the door of that shack
His beard and his hair was long and black
And he was the biggest man I'd ever seen
When he spoke his voice was low and deep
But he just didn't frighten me
'Cause somehow I just knew he wasn't mean
He said what you doing snooping 'round my place
And I saw a smile come across his face
So I smiled back and I told him who I was
He said come on in and pull you up a chair
You might as well since you already here
And he said you can call me Joshua
Joshua Joshua
Whatcha doing living here all alone
Joshua Joshua
Ain't you got nobody to call your own
No no no no

We talked 'til the sun was clean out of sight
And we still talking when it come daylight
And there was just so much we had to say hey
I'd spent my life in an orphan's home
And just like him I was all alone
So I said yeah when he asked if I'd stay
Oh we grew closer as time went on
And that little old shack it was a happy home
And we just couldn't help but fall in love
That big black dog and that little old shack
Sitting down by the railroad track
It's plenty good enough for me and Joshua

Joshua Joshua
Why you're just what I've been looking for
Joshua Joshua
You ain't gonna be lonesome anymore
No no

Yodel-a-he-ho

Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua yeah yeah
Me and Joshua

// The Last One To Touch Me //

If there ever was an angel, then surely you must be one
If there ever was a perfect love when I look at you I see one
If there's heaven on earth, then this must surely be
And I want you to be the last one to touch me
The last thing I remember before I go to sleep
Is the touch of your sweet lips softly kissing me
And I go to sleep athinking how happy you make me
And I want you to be the last one to touch me

And when it's time to lay me down for my eternal sleep
Once more let your fingers softly touch my cheek
If I know that you have touched me, then I can sleep in peace
And I want you to be the last one to touch me

And when the night is over and time will be no more
They say that we shall meet again upon the golden shore
And so when I awaken from my eternal sleep
I want you to be the first one to touch me
I want you to be the first, the last, the only one to touch me

// Walls Of My Mind //

In grave in my mind there are pictures mem'ries of a love I knew one time
So I find in my thoughts I stand looking
At the mem'ries hanging on the walls of my mind
I see a mem'ry of raindrops falling in the park on the day we met
Walking with each other through the rain laughing talking as we both got soak and wet
The mem'ry made that day I could never put away
That's the day he told me he'd be mine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
And I have a mem'ry of springtime cherry blossoms and bird singing on the vine
And the secret place we'd hide and laid together side by side
And the love that shined so brightly in his eyes
Springtime I recall was the sweetest time of all
That's the season our hearts became entwine
And that's just one of the mem'ries he left hanging on the wall of my mind
Through the spring and summer he loved me and his love died with autumn leaves
His love was the wild and restless kind
When he left he left with me so many memories
He left them hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
Mhm mhm hanging on the wall of my mind on my mind
He left them hanging on my mind

// It Ain't Fair That It Ain't //

It ain't fair for you to leave me cold and cryin' in the night
It ain't fair to take your body from my arms and out of sight
It ain't fair you've gone and left me where you kissed me I still burn
Are you leaving for my loving this awful hurt and then return
It ain't fair for you to leave me alone to face the morning light
It ain't fair you took my body and then to say that it ain't right
It ain't fair you've made me your woman a no longer a good girl in your eyes
How come before you said you'd love me it ain't fair that it ain't right
It just ain't fair that it ain't right

// J.J. Sneed //

At last I have called up with you and you're a sight to see
Could this really be my outlaw lover JJ Sneed
Could a woman with a painted face and pretty sweet disguise
Turn your heart against me with her evil cunning eyes her evil cunning eyes
JJ it's been you and me right from the very start
And ever job we ever pulled I'd always done my part
We'd really stick together until the bitter end
And it was my understanding we were whole lots more than friends
A whole lot more than friends
And it was me that kept you on when nights were dark and cold
But I guess I didn't look like much in these old ragged clothes
But you said it didn't matter cause you love me that a way
You said that no one else could ever steal your heart away steal your heart away
Do you recall the Union Bank we robbed in Franklin Town
And as we made our getaway the sheriff gunned you down
And I doctored up your bullet wounds and nursed you while you sit
But now you have betrayed me is that the thanks I get is that the thanks I get
Oh yeah JJ I'm thinking now of how we'd all begun
Of all the times we've robbed and killed with our trust wordy gun
Why we stood off a fuss it was JJ just you and I
But now you have betrayed me and for that you're gonna die
Yeah for that you're gonna die
The good old days are over as we stand here in the rain
JJ I'm gonna shoot you now I hope you'll feel no pain
I hear whoopees of the horses and fieces on my trail
I guess I'll join you soon but for now JJ farewell for now JJ farewell

// You Can't Reach Me Anymore //

You can't reach me anymore
You say I'm not the girl that you remember
You say that I have changed so much and you can't seem to reach me
Well you destroyed everything I used to be before and you can't reach me anymore
I was looked up to you while you were looking down
It used to turn me off inside when you would turn me down
Now you want the love from me that you destroyed before
But you can't reach me anymore
Now you say you love me more than anything
I used to love you that way now I don't feel a thing
The love that once lived in my heart don't live there anymore
And you can't reach me anymore
I was looked up to you while you were looking down
It used to turn me off when you would turn me down
Love that once lived in my heart it don't live there anymore
And you can't reach me anymore oh oh oh no you can't reach me anymore

// Daddy's Moonshine Still //

Folks say my daddy wasn't much of a man 
For disobeying the laws of the land 
Folks say that my daddy wasn't fit to kill 
Oh and I know it was true what the people said 
Cause we'd all've been better of dead 
Than to live a life of shame and strife 
Cause of daddy's moonshine still 

My mama was always sweet and kind 
But she grew old before her time 
Worryin' about the way we had to live 

Yeah my daddy put the wrinkles in my mama's face 
He drunk his share of all he made 
And just one more reason I grew to hate 
My daddy's moonshine still 

[Chorus:]
Daddy's moonshine still was good for nothin' 
But to break mama's heart 
And to tear our home apart 
Make our lives a livin' hell 

Them old mason jars that daddy made us wash 
And set them out to sun on our back porch 
'Til he got ready to take 'em up on the hill 
And when daddy got word of the revenue 
He made us kids help hide his brew 
Made us swear that we never knew 
About daddy's moonshine still 

Yeah and two of my brothers drove across the state line 
Once a week with a load of moonshine 
And the wounds that came from that won't ever heal 
Cause on a moonshine run one rainy night 
My two brothers lost their lives 
And oh my god how I despise 
My daddy's moonshine still 

[Repeat Chorus]

Well it broke mama's heart but she understood 
The day that I left home for good 
But I had to find me another way to live 
Well I sent mama money nearly every day 
And how I made it, well I'd rather not say 
But at least it took me far away 
From daddy's moonshine still 

My bootlegging daddy was known quite well 
And he made our home a livin' hell 
And I ain't forgot it and I know that I never will 
My mama finally died she just gave up 
And daddy finally died from drinkin' that stuff 
And bad memories haunt the rest of us 
From daddy's moonshine still 

[Repeat Chorus]

// Chicken Every Sunday //

Just because all my dresses are just cotton hand-me-downs
This family calls me the lower class
Cause we're only poor folks on the other side of town
They won't let him walk up my path
But my mama says don't worry when they say those things about ye
You remember you're just as good as him
Just because they got that big house settin' way upon the hill
Why you don't have to look up to them
We've got chicken every Sunday and the preacher comes around
And every Saturday morning daddy takes us all to town
And we'd go to the picture show or picnics on the ground
Oh that's the lower class and I'm glad that's what I am

[Guitar]

Cause my mama don't belong to the ladies social set
My daddy can't afford the country club
His folks look down on me and they don't let us date
Cause they think that I'm not good enough
But my mama says forgive him honey he ain't worthy of
And in anything you're too good for him
Just because they've got money and a big fine house
Well we won't take no self off of them
We've got chicken every Sunday...
We've got chicken every Sunday...

// Fire's Still Burning //

Familiar sounds tell me it's morning the night has been so dark and long
Each night without you just gets longer
While this torch I still carry just burns stronger
I know I never will stop loving you my tears just can't put out the flame
Or drown my hopes of your returning cause baby the fire's still burning

[Steel]

Wherever you are I hope you're happy although your love for me has died
But if you ever need or want me I'll take you back any time
I know I never will stop...
Yes baby the fire's still burning

// Letter To Heaven //

An old man was sitting at his table one day
Writing a letter to pass time away
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
Saying, won't you please write a letter for me?

Oh, what will I say in this letter I pray
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
I coming to see her real soon I hope
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat

Tell mommy I love her, the little girl said
And I pray every evening 'for I go to bed
That God up in Heaven will answer my prayers
And take me to live with my mommy up there

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out never looked either way
A big auto hit her and sped away fast
The little girls prayers had been answered at last

The postman was passing and picked up the note
Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke
Straight up into heaven this letter did go
She's happy up there with her mommy, I know
