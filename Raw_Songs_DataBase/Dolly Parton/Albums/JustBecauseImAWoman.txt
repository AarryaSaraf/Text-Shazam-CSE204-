// You're Gonna Be Sorry //

Some day you're gonna want me but I ain't gonna be around
Some day you'll find you miss the kiss that you're forever turnin' down
When you decide you want the love that once you could've had
Well that's gonna be to bad and you're gonna be sorry

You're gonna be sorry for all the dirty deals you've handed me
All the nights you stayed away you wished you'd spent with me
While you were busy makin' out, I was busy makin' plans for checkin' out
And when you find this out, you're gonna be sorry

You'll wake up cryin for me like I've done so many nights for you
You'll walk the floor and you'll call my name but I ain't gonna hear you
You'll curse the night and you'll hate yourself for ever doin' me wrong
But I'm gonna be long gone and you're gonna be sorry

You're gonna be sorry for all the dirty deals you've handed me
All the nights you've stayed away you wished you'd spent with me
While you were busy makin' out, I was busy makin' plans for checkin' out
And when you find I'm gone, you're gonna be sorry

You're gonna be sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

// I Wish I Felt This Way At Home //

If I, could be with you forever
My restless heart
Would never want to roam

I've never been loved
The way you love me

I wish I felt this way at home
When you kiss me
It's words without speaking
And I don't believe that
God would call this wrong
Your arms are the refuge
I was seeking

I wish I felt this way at home

But I don't, and I won't
We did all that we could

He and I
We tried hard
But it's just no good
I may never be free
Cause I've no reason
And I don't expect you to wait that long
But I'll say one more time

As I'm leavin'

I wish I felt this way at home

Yes, I wish I felt this way at home

// False Eyelashes //

Folks back home think I'm a star now when they hear my records play
They say there home town girl made good and she'd go a long long way
Mom wonders why I don't drive back in that big fine car I own
The truth is I don't have a car and I'm ashamed to go back home

A pair of false eye lashes and a tube of cheap lipstick
A pair of worn out high heel shoes and a dress doesn't fit
These are all my possessions all I have to my name
And a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame

I'm so glad that dad can't see me now, his favorite little girl
Singing in this dingy place on the wrong side of the world
And I'm glad that I can't see the boy that offered me his name
For I was blind and turned from him in this empty search for fame

A pair of false eye lashes and a tube of cheap lipstick
A pair of worn out high heel shoes and a dress doesn't fit
These are all of my possessions, all I have to my name
And a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame

Yes a record played in my home town is my only claim to fame

// I'll Oil Wells Love You //

I met a man in Texas
And oh, he was so fine
And I said to myself
Self, I'm gonna make him mine
He owned a lot of oil wells and his bank roll sure was healthy
And I new if I married him I'd suddenly be wealthy
Oh I'll oil wells love you
I'll oil wells care
I'll oil wells need you
I want you oil wells dear

Well I never had no money
Not a penny to my name
And I said I'd find a rich man
And I'd love my way to fame
So he took mt in his arms
And I cuddled up real near
The money bug then bit me and I wispered in his ear

Oh, I'll oil wells love you
I'll oil wells care
I'll oil wells need you
I want you oil wells dear

He looked in to my eyes and thought he saw a love light shine
Nearly did he know that that light was dollar signs
Now that we are married there ain't nothin' left to tell
We'll live happily ever after because all is well that ends well

Oh, I'll oil wells love you
I'll oil wells care
I'll oil wells need you
I want you oil wells dear

// The Only Way Out (Is To Walk Over Me) //

The only way out
Is to walk over me
So you found someone else
And you're going to leave
Did she tell you
I don't love you?
Did you really believe?

On the floor, by the door
I'll be down on me knees

[Chorus:]
Cause the only way out
Is to walk over me

You don't hear and you don't feel
But i know you can see
And just to prove that i love you,
I'll crawl at your feet

Just look down, at the ground
Where your footprints will be

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
You have put me
Just as low
As anyone ought to go
But i'll lay down beside
What's left of my pride
If you go, then you'll
Know, cause you can't help
But see that
The only way out is to walk
Over me

[Bridge]

Yes the only way out
Is to walk over me

// Little Bit Slow To Catch On //

I'm a little bit slow to catch on
But when I do, I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on

Well, I couldn't see the light for the brightness
Of the sweet little smile you gave me
I couldn't see how you were cheatin' on me
But finally I'm a catchin' on, on
Finally, I'm a' catchin' on

I'm a little bit slow to catch on
But when I do, I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on

I couldn't see the hurt for the happy
And at first that's the way you made me
It took me a while to get your style
But finally I'm a' catchin' on, on
Finally I'm a' catchin' on

I'm a little bit slow to catch on
But when I do, I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on

You say you can't see the light for the darkness
That surrounds you since I'm gone
You can't eat or sleep 'cause you're lonely
Well, finally you're catchin' on, on
Finally you're a' catchin' on

I'm a little bit slow to catch on
But when I do, I'm caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on

I'm a little bit slow to catch on
But when I do, I'm a caught on
A little bit slow to move on
But your baby is a' movin' on, on
Your baby is a' movin' on

// The Bridge //

The bridge, so high
The bridge, so tall
Here is where it started
On the bridge
The moon is big and yellow
And the stars are all a' glow
From the bridge, I see reflections
In the waters far below

You kissed me for the first time here
An' held me awfully tight
And the bridge became our favorite place
We came here often in the night

And one night while standing on the bridge
Desire swept through us both
Passion took us by the hand
And showed us where to go

From the bridge we saw a meadow
So we ran together there
Where we found love together
Our emotions filled the air

The bridge, so wide
The bridge, so long
Where once we stood together
Tonight I stand alone

Tonight, while standing on the bridge
My heart is beating wild
To think that you could leave me here
With our unborn child

My feet are moving slowly
Closer to the edge
Here is where it started
And here is where I'll end it...

// Love And Learn //

That's the way love is, you have to love and learn
I've lost again
Why can't I win?
These tears that I cry
Make my eyes burn

Each new love I find
Turns out to be the wrong kind
And it looks like I'll
Just have to love and learn

Love and learn
Hurt and yearn
For someone who will
Love me in return

I'll be hurt many times
Before the right one, I find
But that's the way love is
You have to love and learn

Love and learn
Just hurt and yearn
For someone
Who will love me in return

I'll be hurt many times
Before the right one, I find
But that's the way love is
You have to love and learn
Yes, that's the way love is
You have to love and learn

// I'm Running Out Of Love //

I'm running out of love and I'm running out of patience
You seem to get worse every day
I'm running out of love, better learn to resist temptation
Or someday you'll wake up and I'll be far away

How long did you think you could keep on doing me wrong
How long did you think I'd stay quiet and take it
The love I had for you is almost gone
And I ain't gonna let you take my heart and break it

I'm running out of love and I'm running out of patience
You seem to get worse every day
I'm running out of love, better learn to resist temptation
Or someday you'll wake up and I'll be far away

You come and go just any time you want to
And you never bother to tell me where your going
And I wonder if there's anything you don't do
Someday you'll pay for the wild seed your sewing

I'm running out of love and I'm running out of patience
You seem to get worse every day
I'm running out of love, better learn to resist temptation
Or someday you'll wake up and I'll be far away

// Just Because I'm A Woman //

I can see you're disappointed
By the way you look at me
And I'm sorry that I'm not
The woman you thought I'd be
Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman

So when you look at me
Don't feel sorry for yourself
Just think of all the shame
You might have brought somebody else

Just let me tell you this
Then we'll both know where we stand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman

Now a man will take a good girl
And he'll ruin her reputation
But when he wants to marry
Well, that's a different situation

He'll just walk off and leave her
To do the best she can
While he looks for an angel
To wear his wedding band

Now I know that I'm no angel
If that's what you thought you'd found
I was just the victim of
A man that let me down

Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman

No, my mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman

// Baby Sister //

Baby sister what a waste to see you in this place
I lose my mind from worrying over you
In a bar room filled with people all higher than a steeple
But I know why you do the things you do

And I curse the man that made you what you are today
I hope he dies a thousand times a thousand ways
Your eyes are filled with tears, sis lets get out of here
Cause I love you baby sister, lets go home

And I curse the man that made you what you are today
I hope he dies a thousand times a thousand ways
Your eyes are filled with tears, sis lets get out of here
Cause I love you baby sister, lets go home
Cause I love you baby sister, lets go home

// Try Being Lonely //

Suppose you wanted someone the way I want you
Just imagine your body, mind and soul breaking in two
Walk the floor each night, shed tears you can't conceal
Just try being lonely, then you'll know just how I feel

I saw you with your new love and oh it hurt me so
Funny how I see your face everywhere I go
You smiled and looked to be so happy as you passed by
So I hurried around the corner so you wouldn't see me cry

Suppose you wanted someone the way I want you
Just imagine your body, mind and soul breaking in too
Walk the floor each night, shed tears you can't conceal
Just try being lonely, then you know just how I feel
Just try being lonely, then you know just how I feel
