// Put It Off Until Tomorrow //

Put it off until tomorrow
Wo-wo
You've hurt me enough today
You say our love is over
That you have found another
You say you're going away

But leave me tomorrow
Wo-wo
You've hurt me enough today

You've hurt me enough today
I can't believe the words you say
But I must accept the fact
You won't be coming back

Oh, stay
Stay just one more day
Loneliness isn't far away

Put it off until tomorrow
Wo-wo
You've hurt me enough today
Put it off until tomorrow
Wo-wo
You've hurt me enough today

// Because One Of Us Was Wrong //

I'm sorry I was weak enough to step out on you
Well, I should have been strong enough not to step out on you too
I know that I'd hurt you and I stepped out for spite
Because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right

I'm not making excuses for myself I was wrong as I could be
But you shouldn't have cheapened yourself trying to get even with me
My conscience bothers me mine won't let me sleep at night
Because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right

Two wrongs don't make one right and now we both got heartaches
But if we both try we can forgive each other for our mistakes
We let no wonderful love slip through our hands we'd better hold on tight
Because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right
Because one of us was wrong don't mean the other one was right

// The Last Thing On My Mind //

It's a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'
In your hand, in your hand
Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh, I could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

As we walk along my thoughts are tumblin'
Round and round, round and round
Underneath our feet are someplace rumblin'
Underground, underground

Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh, I could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

I've got reason a plenty for goin'
This I know, this I know
The weeds have been steadily growin'
Please don't go, please don't go

Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
I could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh, I could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
You know that was the last thing on my mind

// Love Is Worth Living //

I know what you're thinking when you look at me
The love in your eyes is so easy to see
It's real and it's good what I feel for you
Love is worth living when you love like we do

I understand when you're not feeling well
If there's something on your mind I always can tell
I'm there when you need me and you're there when I need you
Love is worth living when you love like we do

Love is worth living when you love like we do
We found the happiness that very few do
You know that I want you and you know that I want you
Love is worth living when you love like we do

Love is worth living when you love like we do
We found the happiness that very few do
You know that I want you and you know that I want you
Love is worth living when you love like we do
Love is worth living when you love like we do

// Just Between You And Me //

So I feel so blue sometimes I want to die
And so I've got a broken heart so what
They say that time will heal all wounds in mice and men
And I know that someday I'll forget and love again

But just between you and me I've got my doubts about it
Just between you and me you're too much to forget

So I've lost the only one I've ever loved
And so I've never felt so low so what
I'll just tell myself each time I want to cry
That someday time will dry the teardrops from my eyes

Just between you and me I'm not so sure about it
Just between you and me you're too much to forget
You're too much to forget

// Mommie, Ain't That Daddy //

The snow was fallin' swiftly and it mounted on the street
Little footprints in the snow made by our children's feet
As I walked them to the good will store to get some clothes to wear
As we turned around the corner I saw you standing there
I tried to turn the children and walk the other way
I prayed they hadn't seen you then I heard the baby say
"Mommie, ain't that Daddy holding out his hand
Begging for money from that other man?"

They asked me "Ain't that Daddy?"
And "Yes" I had to say
And I wondered if I'd failed you
And made you turn this way

No, you didn't fail me, my weakness was just too strong
Because you see, I thought more of the bottle than our family and our home
No, you didn't fail me sweetheart, you loved me all you could
You had my babies and you loved me like no other woman ever would

You know I guess I'd be better off dead
Than in the awful ship I'm in
But death just don't seem to have a place for those that stay drunk on whiskey, wine and gin
You see I die a constant death over and over every day

If I could change, you know I'd do it for you, the babies and our home
But you might as well forget me for I'm just too forward gone
But I wish you would do me one last favor and do it just for me
When they ask you, "Momma ain't that Daddy?"
Just say "It used to be"

// 4-0-33 //

Well, the two new people that's moved to the middle of the block
And we're at the top of the town and don't you think we're not
Well, we found love and happiness people envy us you see
For we found heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33

Yes, we found what most people are looking for
And it's not a lotta money to spend on real fine car
But it's so when and where a bird flies and sings so free
And there's whole lotta winds in this little house at 4-0-33

Four thousandth block proves what true love can do
Once a lonely place but was sold to me and you

Oh, all around the house you can see little children play
But they're not as a people's kids were proud to say
They are the symbol of our love for all the world to see
They're a part of heaven right here on earth at 4-0-33

Our love's on the day you can see many people drive by
For look at the house they think there from the sky
They think this place would make them as happy as you and me
And the whole town's tryin' to buy our house at 4-0-33

Four thousandth block proves
And we're not gonna sale our happy little house at 4-0-33
Wouldn't take a pretty thing for the love we had at 4-0-33

// Sorrow's Tearing Down The House //

I met you and we married we planned our future well
We built our home on happiness then suddenly it fell
It wasn't long there after our love began to tilt
Sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built

First came the weekly parties that never seemed to end
And then came the heartbreak brought by so-called friends
I guess that I'm as much to blame and while we share the guilt
Sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built

First came the weekly parties that never seemed to end
And then came the heartbreak brought by so-called friends
I guess that I'm as much to blame and while we share the guilt
Sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built
Sorrow's tearing down the house that happiness once built

// This Time Has Gotta Be Our Last Time //

Here we are again going in this cheap place
What if was seen by a friend and they recognize our face
We both know that it's wrong we both should be at home
This time has gotta be our last time

I know that you want me just as much as I want you
You've got a family and I've got one too
From now on we must stay apart we just can't break all their hearts
This time has gotta be our last time

This time has gotta be our last time
We'll put our rings back on our hands
Your conscience hurt you well mine does too
I'm not this kind of woman and I'm not this kind of man
We just can't go on cheating neither of us is this kind
This time has gotta be our last time
This time has gotta be our last time

// Before I Met You //

I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time
But that was before I met you
I never saw one that I wanted for mine
But that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you

I thought I'd stay single always be free
But that was before I met you
I said that no sweet thang could ever hold me
But that was before I met you

I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you

That was before I met you

// Home Is Where The Hurt Is //

We're well known in every honky tonk in town
Not a night goes by that we don't make the rounds
People wonder why we choose to live this way
Why don't they ever stay at home I hear them say

But home is where the hurt is
Cause love doesn't live there anymore
Home is where the hurt is
That's why we don't stay at home much anymore

What was once our happy home has come to be
A place to fuss and fight and disagree
Our lonely house with wall to wall regret
And these bright lights somehow help us to forget

Cause home is where the hurt is
Cause love doesn't live there anymore
Home is where the hurt is
That's why we don't stay at home much anymore
That's why we don't stay at home much anymore
