Album: AlwaysAlways

// Milwaukee Here I Come //

I'm gonna get on that old turnpike and I'm gonna ride
I'm gonna leave this town 'til you decide
Which one you want the most, them Opery stars or me
Milwaukee here I come from Nashville, Tennessee

Milwaukee's where we were before we came here
Working in a brewery, making the finest beer
She came to me on a payday night, said
"Let's go to Tennessee," so we came down to Nashville to the Grand Ole Opery

We turned on the TV, Porter Wagoner was singing loud
I said that's the man for me, I love him, there's no doubt
I'm leaving now see if I can find out where he's at
And if I can't find him, I'll settle for that bluegrass Lester Flatt

I'm going now and trade my old Ford for an Olds
I might get all drunked up and trade it for a Rolls
But there's one thing I know for sure, I'll always be blue
There ain't no way to get drunk enough to stop loving you

// Yours Love //

May the fruit of my toil be yours love
May the food from my soil be yours love
And from this moment on may a love that is strong
That lives on and on be yours love

May the sons that I raise be yours love
May the comforts I praise be yours love
If I ever get weak may the love words I speak
And the arms that I seek be yours love

May the Lord's shining grace be yours love
May the happiest face be yours love
May the last fingertips that touch these two lips
As life from me slips be yours love

And from this moment on may a love that is strong
That lives on and on be yours love

// Malena //

(A wish that Malena had wings)

Malena for hours would run in the meadow
Well, Malena would go to play every day
She chased butterflies and she'd say with the smile
If I had wings I could fly that away
Malena would cry when we try to explain
That little girl's world's supposed to have wings
That only in heaven can little girls fly
We'd see a strange look in Malena's eyes

(A wish that Malena had wings)

We'll always remember Malena's last birthday
Boxes with bright colored ribbon and string
And the wish that she made as she blew out the candles
A wish that Malena had wings
And with all the gifts that we bought for Malena
The wish that she made we could not satisfy
But on the night of her birthday the angels fulfilled it
They gave her wings and now Malena can fly

Malena has wings and Malena can fly
On the wings of an angel in heaven on high
From the time she could talk her wish was the same
A wish that Malena had wings
(A wish that Malena had wings)

// The House Where Love Lives //

A squeaky gate, a welcome mat, a big shaggy dog that lives out back
And some might even call it a shack but this is the house where love lives

The paint is peelin' off of the ceils, the mailbox is full of bills
And it's no mansion on the hill but this is the house where love lives

There's a little boy who looks just you with freckles on his nose and eyes of blue
A little girl almost two and everybody says she looks just like you

So thank you dear for loving me, though I know rich we'll never be
But that doesn't matter to you and me 'cause we live in the house where love lives

So thank you dear for loving me though, I know rich we'll never be
But that doesn't matter to you and me 'cause we live in the house where love lives
We live in the house where love lives

// Why Don't You Haul Off And Love Me //

They say the love bug will get you at the age of 23
Well, I'm not tellin' my age but somethin' got a hold on me
I'm just cravin' some lovin' in the old fashion way
Honey linger near and listen to all I had to say

Why don't you haul off and love me one more time
Why don't you squeeze me until I'm turning blind
If you don't cuddle off and love me like I want you to do
I'm gonna haul off and die over you

I can feel your warm lips near me hear you breathe so soft and fine
I can feel the matrimony crawlin' up and down my spine
I don't believe this love will hurt you cause it feels so nice and kind
It seems mighty close to heaven when your love is on the line

Why don't you haul off and love me one more time
Why don't you squeeze me until I'm turning blind
If you don't cuddle off and love me like I want you to do
I'm gonna haul off and die over you
I'm gonna haul off and die over you

// Always, Always //

Darling, will you love me forever
Always, always
Will you keeps these vows we mad together
Always, always
Will your love be as strong if my dreams will go wrong
Always, always

Darling, will you stay with me forever
Always, always
Will your love remain through stormy weather
Always, always
To walk the roads that might get rough
Always, always

In return for your love I'll be true as stars above
Always, always
And the love that I feel will forever be so real
Always, always

// There Never Was A Time //

There was a time we'd sit in the backyard cause the house would get so hot
From the summer sun there was no way of sleepin'
And you'd play your old guitar we'd fight mosquitos and enjoyed
Your backyard concerts for we had no television
We'd just begun our life as man and wife and hard ships then
Could scaresly scare us into quittin'
Things were far from bein' fine we often dined upon a dime
But there never was a time we didn't love

That Christmas brought us saddest days
When your pride gave a way you told the kids
There'd be no gifts 'cause we were broke
Though their little tears of grief was so hard to see it didn't hurt me
Like the love I knew was in your throat
It was then with arms entwined we both broke down and cried
For it seemed ike nothing good would ever come
The doctor bills we couldn't pay they came and took our car away
But there never was a time we didn't love

Now there's an easy chair for my back a satin pillow for your head
And the kids are wild about the brand new car
You and I can order steak with all the trimmings and not worry
If we've spent a dollar more than we can spare
No wonder in your prayers we've thanked the man upstairs who led us through
The years of rearin' kids and payin' bills
And I think he guided us not because we were smart but just because
There never was a time we didn't love
No there never was a time never was a time
Never was a time we didn't love

// Good As Gold //

I'll agree that we may never own a mansion
And the furniture in our house might be old
But we've got something that's worth so much more than money
We've got each other and that's as good as gold

Of course we dream of all the things enjoyed by others
And we've married without even wedding rings
Yet there they envy us so often we've been told
We've got each other and that's as good as gold

I'd love to rush into the house and tell you
That we've got oil in our backyard so I been told
But in a way I'm glad we've not we're so much richer without we've got
We've got each other and that's as good as gold

Of course we dream of all the things enjoyed by others
And we've married without even wedding rings
Yet there they envy us so often we've been told
We've got each other and that's as good as gold

// My Hands Are Tied //

To be with you is what I want more than anything
But I must share my life with the one who wears my ring
And there are tiny places I look into each night
I love you but my hands are tied

I know how much they need you and dear I understand
I know you'll never leave them 'cause you're not that kind of man
But I can't control my feelings though heaven knows I tried
And I love you but my hands are tied

My hands are tied and I can't break the ties that bind
I love you more than life but you never will be mine
I know how much you want me I can see it in your eyes
And I love you but my hands are tied

My hands are tied and I can't break the ties that bind
I love you more than life but you never will be mine
I know how much you want me I can see it in your eyes
And I love you but my hands are tied
Yes, I love you but my hands are tied

// No Reason To Hurry Home //

There is no love and there is no hate
There is no feeling at all
I look at you and you look at me
But we might as well stare at the wall

Cause you don't see me and I don't see you
Just a shadow of love that is gone
There is no love and there is no hate
No reason to hurry home

There's no tiny hands to reach out to us
No plans bein' made anymore
We have no tomorrow our future is gone
There's only sadness in store

We don't care enough to even ask questions
And when we're together we still feel alone
There is no love and there is no hate
No reason to hurry home
There is nothing to look forward to
No reason to hurry home

// Anything's Better Than Nothing //

Friends ask how I'll get along without you
They say it's so sad we're apart
I have to agree that I don't seem like me
I'm havin' a ball with my heart

Anything's better than nothing
Nothing's not too much to lose
Anything's better than nothing
Nothing's what I have with you

I've got to admit that it hurts me
I don't like to fight or to fuss
But now you and me are just happy we're free
And everyone's crying but us

Anything's better than nothing
Nothing's not too much to lose
Anything's better than nothing
Nothing's what I have with you

It really must be disappointment
To see love and dreams turn to smoke
I can't blame my friends when their teardrops begin
I once thought that love made a home

Anything's better than nothing
Nothing's not too much to lose
Anything's better than nothing
Nothing's what I have with you
...
