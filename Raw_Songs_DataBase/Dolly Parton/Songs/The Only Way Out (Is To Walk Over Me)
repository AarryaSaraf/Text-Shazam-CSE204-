The only way out
Is to walk over me
So you found someone else
And you're going to leave
Did she tell you
I don't love you?
Did you really believe?

On the floor, by the door
I'll be down on me knees


Cause the only way out
Is to walk over me

You don't hear and you don't feel
But i know you can see
And just to prove that i love you,
I'll crawl at your feet

Just look down, at the ground
Where your footprints will be




You have put me
Just as low
As anyone ought to go
But i'll lay down beside
What's left of my pride
If you go, then you'll
Know, cause you can't help
But see that
The only way out is to walk
Over me



Yes the only way out
Is to walk over me
