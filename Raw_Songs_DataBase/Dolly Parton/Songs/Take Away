We don't take away one happy moment
We won't take away any of the new
We'll do anything to make each other happy
Love is give and take, but we don't take away

I never thought that love could make you feel so happy
I thought I'd found love once, but I wasn't even close
Well, you make me wanna call you sweet names at the waking of each day
'Cause each day I love you more and we won't never take away

We don't take away one happy moment
We won't take away any of the new
We'll do anything to make each other happy
Love is give and take but we don't take away
Love is give and take but we don't take away, take away, mhm
