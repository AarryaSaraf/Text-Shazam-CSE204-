At last I have called up with you and you're a sight to see
Could this really be my outlaw lover JJ Sneed
Could a woman with a painted face and pretty sweet disguise
Turn your heart against me with her evil cunning eyes her evil cunning eyes
JJ it's been you and me right from the very start
And ever job we ever pulled I'd always done my part
We'd really stick together until the bitter end
And it was my understanding we were whole lots more than friends
A whole lot more than friends
And it was me that kept you on when nights were dark and cold
But I guess I didn't look like much in these old ragged clothes
But you said it didn't matter cause you love me that a way
You said that no one else could ever steal your heart away steal your heart away
Do you recall the Union Bank we robbed in Franklin Town
And as we made our getaway the sheriff gunned you down
And I doctored up your bullet wounds and nursed you while you sit
But now you have betrayed me is that the thanks I get is that the thanks I get
Oh yeah JJ I'm thinking now of how we'd all begun
Of all the times we've robbed and killed with our trust wordy gun
Why we stood off a fuss it was JJ just you and I
But now you have betrayed me and for that you're gonna die
Yeah for that you're gonna die
The good old days are over as we stand here in the rain
JJ I'm gonna shoot you now I hope you'll feel no pain
I hear whoopees of the horses and fieces on my trail
I guess I'll join you soon but for now JJ farewell for now JJ farewell
