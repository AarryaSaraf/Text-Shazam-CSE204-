A squeaky gate, a welcome mat, a big shaggy dog that lives out back
And some might even call it a shack but this is the house where love lives

The paint is peelin' off of the ceils, the mailbox is full of bills
And it's no mansion on the hill but this is the house where love lives

There's a little boy who looks just you with freckles on his nose and eyes of blue
A little girl almost two and everybody says she looks just like you

So thank you dear for loving me, though I know rich we'll never be
But that doesn't matter to you and me 'cause we live in the house where love lives

So thank you dear for loving me though, I know rich we'll never be
But that doesn't matter to you and me 'cause we live in the house where love lives
We live in the house where love lives
