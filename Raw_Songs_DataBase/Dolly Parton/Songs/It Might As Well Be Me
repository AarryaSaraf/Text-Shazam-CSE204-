I'm lookin' for a way to get out
There's no hope for you and me
We'll never get along
Everything we do is wrong
You and I both know one of us has to go
And it might as well be me

We stopped loving a long time ago
And now all we do is disagree
There's no use to pretend
There's no need to try again
You and I both know one of us has to go
And it might as well be me

There's no use for us to live a lie
When we're just wasting the best years of our lives
We'll never get along everything we do is wrong
You and I both know one of us has to go
And it might as well be me
You and I both know one of us has to go
And it might as well be me
