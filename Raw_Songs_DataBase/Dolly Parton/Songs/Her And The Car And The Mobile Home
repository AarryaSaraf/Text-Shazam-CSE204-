Well, my wife and I were happy in our trailer
But she didn't dig my running around all night
Well, I warned you a couple times 'bout leaving
Oh, but you just laughed and took it kinda light

Well, I shoulda paid attention to her warning
When she told me she'd leave if I didn't change
'Cause when I come home about sun up this morning
Well, I detected something mighty strange

Her and the car and the mobile home are gone, boys
I was taking off while you was a-carrying on
Now things are really shot, I came home to an empty lot
Yeah, me and the car and the mobile home was gone
Yes, her and the car and the mobile home was gone

Well, the neighbors all around me were a-laughing
And it made me feel about ten inches tall
I knew you didn't think that I'd really leave you
Uh, not to mention taking home and all

Well, talk about somebody bewildered
I bet you didn't know what to do nor where to go
I found little consolation in my wardrobe
That you left scattered on the patio

Her and the car and the mobile home are gone, boys
I was taking off while you was a-carrying on
Now things are really shot, I came home to an empty lot
Yeah, me and the car and the mobile home was gone, gone
Yes, her and the car and the mobile home was gone

Yeah, they was gone along with everything else
Except a few old western suits she left scattered there on the patio
And they had mud all over 'em where she stomped around on 'em
Stepped on them wagon wheels, busted the spokes out
You know that real nice lavender suit?
One that she said I looked good in, looked like Tom Jones
That's it hanging over in that tree
She took that piece of chalk and wrote across the front of the coat
Have a good time, darling
You know, when you're hot, you're hot
