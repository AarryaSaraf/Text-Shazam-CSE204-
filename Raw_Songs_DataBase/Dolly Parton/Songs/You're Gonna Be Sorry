Some day you're gonna want me but I ain't gonna be around
Some day you'll find you miss the kiss that you're forever turnin' down
When you decide you want the love that once you could've had
Well that's gonna be to bad and you're gonna be sorry

You're gonna be sorry for all the dirty deals you've handed me
All the nights you stayed away you wished you'd spent with me
While you were busy makin' out, I was busy makin' plans for checkin' out
And when you find this out, you're gonna be sorry

You'll wake up cryin for me like I've done so many nights for you
You'll walk the floor and you'll call my name but I ain't gonna hear you
You'll curse the night and you'll hate yourself for ever doin' me wrong
But I'm gonna be long gone and you're gonna be sorry

You're gonna be sorry for all the dirty deals you've handed me
All the nights you've stayed away you wished you'd spent with me
While you were busy makin' out, I was busy makin' plans for checkin' out
And when you find I'm gone, you're gonna be sorry

You're gonna be sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
