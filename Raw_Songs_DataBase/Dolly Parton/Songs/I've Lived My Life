I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen
I left the country for the city
Thought I was smart but I was silly
I should've known I'd get in trouble being so green
I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen
I met a boy and learned to love him
I would have done anything for him
I loved him more than anything I've ever seen

I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen

Only eighteen but its all over
I ruined my life to please my lover
I made him happy, he made me cry
Then said goodbye

I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen

Only eighteen but its all over
I ruined my life to please my lover
I made him happy, he made me cry
Then said goodbye

I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen
I've lived my life and I'm only eighteen
