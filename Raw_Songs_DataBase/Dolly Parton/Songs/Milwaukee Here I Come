I'm gonna get on that old turnpike and I'm gonna ride
I'm gonna leave this town 'til you decide
Which one you want the most, them Opery stars or me
Milwaukee here I come from Nashville, Tennessee

Milwaukee's where we were before we came here
Working in a brewery, making the finest beer
She came to me on a payday night, said
"Let's go to Tennessee," so we came down to Nashville to the Grand Ole Opery

We turned on the TV, Porter Wagoner was singing loud
I said that's the man for me, I love him, there's no doubt
I'm leaving now see if I can find out where he's at
And if I can't find him, I'll settle for that bluegrass Lester Flatt

I'm going now and trade my old Ford for an Olds
I might get all drunked up and trade it for a Rolls
But there's one thing I know for sure, I'll always be blue
There ain't no way to get drunk enough to stop loving you
