Why why why did you say goodbye
Why did you walk out on me
Cry cry cry I feel like I could die
Why did you go and leave me lonely
What did I do
What did I say
To make you just walk out and leave me this way
Please come back and tell me
What I did wrong
And I'll make it up to you
If you'll just come back home

I'll try try try as each day goes by
To make you glad that you came back to me
No more good-byes and no more tears to cry
Every day I'll try to make you happy

What did I do
What did I say
To make you just walk out and leave me this way
Please come back and tell me
What I did wrong
And I'll make it up to you
If you'll just come back home

I'll try try try as each day goes by
To make you glad that you came back to me
No more good-byes and no more tears to cry
Every day I'll try to make you happy
