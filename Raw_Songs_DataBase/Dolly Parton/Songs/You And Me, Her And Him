You and me and her and him must get together
And see if maybe we can find a way
To put an end to hurting one another
'Cause he don't and she don't know
How much we hurt each day

It's not fair and you and I both know it
To have to hide and love the way we do
The time is now that we must get together
Her and him, me and you

She and I had lost it long before I met you
We tried and tried but all the love had gone
And I guess respect is all that's kept me with him
Cause there hasn't been no love there in so long

It's not fair and you and I both know it
To have to hide and love the way we do
The time is now that we must get together
Her and him, me and you
