They say the love bug will get you at the age of 23
Well, I'm not tellin' my age but somethin' got a hold on me
I'm just cravin' some lovin' in the old fashion way
Honey linger near and listen to all I had to say

Why don't you haul off and love me one more time
Why don't you squeeze me until I'm turning blind
If you don't cuddle off and love me like I want you to do
I'm gonna haul off and die over you

I can feel your warm lips near me hear you breathe so soft and fine
I can feel the matrimony crawlin' up and down my spine
I don't believe this love will hurt you cause it feels so nice and kind
It seems mighty close to heaven when your love is on the line

Why don't you haul off and love me one more time
Why don't you squeeze me until I'm turning blind
If you don't cuddle off and love me like I want you to do
I'm gonna haul off and die over you
I'm gonna haul off and die over you
