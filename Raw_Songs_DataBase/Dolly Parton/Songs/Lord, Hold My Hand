Hold my hand let's not lose my way hold my hand and lead me home
Guide each step that I might take hold my hand and keep me strong

And let the path I walk be straight let the deeds I do be kind
Let me never hesitate to help my brother walking blind
Hold my hand...

And let my words have meaning of anything that I might speak
If you see me leaning on just hold my hand and straighten me
Hold my hand...
Amen
