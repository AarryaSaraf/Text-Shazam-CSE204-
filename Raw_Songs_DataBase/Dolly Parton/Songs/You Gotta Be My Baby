Oh you said you were my baby
Now I know that you're my baby
But it seems to be you got roamin' eyes
If you wanna be my baby
Then you gotta be my baby
You can't keep your finger in two different lives
I remember how you pleaded
When my love you said you needed
And I believe without a doubt
So if you wanna be my baby
Then you gotta be my baby
And keep those kissin' cousins out

Oh you know how when I said I was a'rollin' low?
I get suspicious and I'm a'gonna tell you so
If you wanna be my baby
Then you gotta be my baby
And be nobody's baby but mine

Just think about it

Now I heard there was another
So I went and asked your mother
If anybody hung around besides me
She gave me no satisfaction
And now I can't take no action
But I think I'll hang around and see

If you wanna be my baby
Then you gotta be my baby
You gotta come to me and tell me so
If you wanna be my baby
Then you gotta be my baby
I'm tired of waitin' around so let them know

Oh how when I said that I'm a Rollin low
I'm gunna get suspicious and I'm gunna tell you so
If you wanna be my baby
Then you gotta be my baby
And be nobody's baby but mine

I said and be nobody's baby but mine

And I mean it!
