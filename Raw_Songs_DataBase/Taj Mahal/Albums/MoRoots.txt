// Cajun Waltz //

Ma négresse, voulez-vous dansez avec moi?
Voulez-vous dansez?
Oh it ain't my fault, 'cause I'm doin' the Cajun Waltz

Voulez-vous cherchez, mon fil peut fumer
Oui, je suis, et tu aussi
Et cherchon [?]
Well now it ain't my Mama's fault, 'cause I'm doin' the Cajun Waltz

Ooh, there was trouble and there was thunder and lightning
And who so ever be the one to blow the first smoke
Child, there was times, oh I felt it was so frightening
So tell them, why don't you go 'head and leave us alone

Ma négresse, voulez-vous dansez
Voulez-vous dansez, avec moi ici
Voulez dansez
Voulez-vous dansez
For it ain't my Mama's fault, big baby's doin' the Cajun Waltz

Cajun Waltz (Cajun Waltz)
Ca, Ca, Cajun Waltz (Cajun Waltz)
Cajun, Cajun, Cajun Waltz (Cajun Waltz)
Cajun Waltz (Cajun Waltz)
Oh, it ain't may Mama's fault, Papa's doin' the Cajun Waltz

// Slave Driver //

Ooh-ooh-oo-ooh... oo-oo-ooh... oo-oo-ooh...
Slave driver, the table is turn (catch a fire)
Catch a fire, so you can get burn, now (catch a fire)
Slave driver, the table is turn (catch a fire)
Catch a fire: gonna get burn (catch a fire) wo, now!

Ev'rytime I hear the crack of a whip
My blood runs cold
I remember on the slave ship
How they brutalize the very souls
Today they say that we are free
Only to be chained in poverty
Good God, I think it's illiteracy
It's only a machine that makes money
Slave driver, the table is turn, y'all
Ooh-ooh-oo-ooh...

Slave driver, uh! The table is turn, baby, now (catch a fire)
Catch a fire, so you can get burn, baby, now (catch a fire)
Slave driver, the table is turn, y'all (catch a fire)
Catch a fire: so you can get burn, now (catch a fire)

Ev'rytime I hear the crack of a whip
My blood runs cold
I remember on the slave ship
How they brutalize the very soul

O God, have mercy on our souls!
Oh, slave driver, the table is turn, y'all (catch a fire)
Catch a fire, so you can get burn (catch a fire)
Slave driver, the table is turn, y'all (catch a fire)
Catch a fire...

// Desperate Lover //

How do you feel when your baby is gone?
How can you sleep with no one to keep you warm?
You toss and turn, you cry all night
It is such a feelin', it is an awful fright

I made a mistake when I break her heart
She couldn't stand it, she decided to part
I've got to find her and apologize
I want no one, she is just my size

Yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, ooh, oh
Yeah, yeah

How do you feel when your baby is gone?
How can you sleep with no one to keep you warm
You toss and turn, you cry all night
It is such a feelin', it is an awful fright

I make a mistake when I break her heart
She couldn't stand it, she decided to part
She couldn't stand it, she decided to part
She could not stand it, she could not stand it
She could not stand, no, no, no, no, no, ooh, la la

// Clara (St. Kitts Woman) //

My Grandfather married one fine St. Kitts woman
My Grandfather married one fine St. Kitts woman
She would come to our house and make on the stove some of those peppermint patties
Putting sugar in our beer call it tay-la-sang tooley why-a-cake-it from me
You know that my Grandfather married one fine St. Kitts woman
She would hold you, love you, and scold you
Making sure she told you everything she could feel

And now I feel that Spirit
Deep down in my Soul
Make me think back to my ancestors
Who lived a long time ago
Who lived a long time ago

When I feel that spirit
Deep down in my Soul
Make me think of some ancestors
Who lived a long time ago
Ruled the world and all its gold

For that my Grandfather married one St. Kitts woman
My Grandfather married one fine St. Kitts woman
She would come lifting with her voice to the house
Making peppermint patties
Taking toknit put some sugar in I beer lie lutill juna taki from me

You know that my Grandfather married one fine St. Kitts woman
She would hold you, love you, and scold you
Making sure she told you they will never know what it is you need

When you here that Spirit
Chuck it to me chuck it
Moving in your Soul
Its a message from an ancestor who lived a long time ago
Ruled the world and all its gold

I say when you feel that Spirit child
Moving in your Soul
Its a message from an ancestor who lived a long time ago
