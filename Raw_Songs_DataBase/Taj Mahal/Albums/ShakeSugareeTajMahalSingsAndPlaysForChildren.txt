// Brown Girl In The Ring //

There's a brown girl in the ring
Tra la la la la
There's a brown girl in the ring
Tra la la la la la
There's a brown girl in the ring
Tra la la la la
And she looks like a sugar in a plum plum plum

All had water run dry
I got nowhere to wash my clothes
All had water run dry
I got nowhere to wash my clothes

Deng-a-deng o suki
Deng-a-deng

I remember one Saturday night
We had fried fish and Johnny-cake
I remember one Saturday night
We had fried fish and Johnny-cake

Deng-a-deng o suki
Deng-a-deng

There's a brown girl in the ring
Tra la la la la
There's a brown girl in the ring
Tra la la la la la
There's a brown girl in the ring
Tra la la la la
And she looks like a sugar in a plum plum plum

There's a brown girl in the ring
Tra la la la la
There's a brown girl in the ring
Tra la la la la la
There's a brown girl in the ring
Tra la la la la
And she looks like a sugar in a plum plum plum

All had water run dry
I got nowhere to wash my clothes
All had water run dry
I got nowhere to wash my clothes

Deng-a-deng o suki
Deng-a-deng

I remember one Saturday night
We had fried fish and Johnny-cake
I remember one Saturday night
We had fried fish and Johnny-cake

Deng-a-deng o suki
Deng-a-deng

There's a brown girl in the ring
Tra la la la la
There's a brown girl in the ring
Tra la la la la la
There's a brown girl in the ring
Tra la la la la
And she looks like a sugar in a plum plum plum

// Light Rain //

Light rain, light rain
Baby, fallin' down
Light rain, light rain
Baby, fallin' down
Soon as it hit my windowpane
Surely hit the ground

Big, bull, bull, bull, bullfrog
Sittin' in the pond
Big, big bullfrog
Baby, sittin' in that pond
Got a white tie and coattails
Got no britches on

Goin' to Houston
Baby, see my pony run
Goin' up Houston
See my pony run
If I win some money, baby
Surely bring you some

Light rain, light rain
Baby, fallin' down
Light rain, light rain
Baby, fallin' down
Soon as it hit my windowpane, mama
Surely hit the ground

// Shake Sugaree //

Have a little song
Won't take long
Sing it right
Once or twice

Oh Lordy me, didn't we shake sugaree?
Everything I got is down in pawn
Everything I got is down in pawn

Pawned my watch
Pawned my chain
Pawned everything
Even pawned my own name

Oh Lordy me, didn't we shake sugaree?
Everything I got is down in pawn
Everything I got, I got in pawn

Have a secret
I ain't gonna tell
I'm goin' to heaven
And I ain't goin' to

Oh Lordy me, didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is down in pawn
Everything I got is down in pawn

Pawned my buggy
Pawned my plough
Pawned everything
Even pawn my old cow

Oh Lordy me, didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is down in pawn
Everything I got is down in pawn

Have a secret
I ain't gonna tell
I'm goin' to heaven
In a brown pea shell

Oh Lordy me, didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is down in pawn
Everything I got is down in pawn

Have a little song
Won't take long
Sing it right
Once or twice

Oh Lordy me, didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got, I got in pawn
Everything I got is down in pawn
