// The Midnight Special //

Oh, let the midnight special
Shine her light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine her ever loving light on me

Yonder come miss Rosie
How in the world do you know?
Now you know her by her apron
And the dress she wore
Umbrella on her shoulder
Piece of paper in her hand
She's gonna see the governor
She wants to release her man

Oh, let the midnight special
Shine her light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine her ever loving light on me

(Yes sir)

When you get up in the mornin'
And the big bell ring
You go marchin' to the table
Well, it's the same old thing
Ain't no food upon the table
And nothin' in the pan
If you say anything about it
You get in trouble with the man

Let the midnight special
Shine her light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine her ever loving light on me
(Let's go!)

(Yes sir)

If you ever go to Houston
Well, you better walk right
You better not squabble
And you better not fight
That cop will arrest you
And he'll sure take you down
And you can bet your bottom dollar
You're jailhouse bound

Let the midnight special
Shine her light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine her ever loving light on me

(Yes sir)

Oh, let the midnight special
Shine the light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine the ever loving light on me
Oh, let the midnight special
Shine her light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine her ever loving light on me

// Hooray Hooray //

I met a pretty little girl
Walking down the avenue
[?] hey old Sonny
Can I come home with you?
We're gonna rock the house tonight
Everything will be alright

Hooray, hooray
The woman is killing me
Hooray, hooray
The woman is killing me
If you don't believe it
Wait right here and see

Yeah, now we walk till midnight
Rock till the break of dawn
Yeah, we dance till midnight
Rocking till the break of dawn
Won't you cool down?
Sonny gonna keep you warm

Oh, baby, it's five o'clock
What you gonna do?
Yeah, it's five o'clock
Oh, what you gonna do?
I don't care, I've been hurting
I'm gon' leave it up to you
And that's when I told her

Hooray, hooray
The woman is killing me
Hooray, hooray
The woman is killing me
If you don't believe it
Wait right here and see

I'm gonna lock this door
And throw that key away
Yes, I'm gonna lock the door
And throw that key away

Stay right here all day

Hooray, hooray
The woman is killing me
Hooray, hooray
The woman is killing me
If you don't believe it
Wait right here and see

Hooray, hooray
The woman is killing me
Hooray, hooray
The woman is killing me
If you don't believe it
Wait right here and see

// I Shall Not Be Moved //

I shall not, I shall not be moved
I shall not, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree planted by the water
I shall not be moved

I shall not, I shall not be moved
I shall not, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree planted by the water
I shall not be moved

I'm sanctified and holy, I shall not be moved
Sanctified and holy, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree planted by the water
I shall not be moved

I'm on my way to heaven, I shall not be moved
On my way to heaven, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved

I shall not, I shall not be moved
I shall not, I shall not be moved
Like a tree planted by the water
I shall not be moved

I shall not, I shall not be moved
I shall not, I shall not be moved
Like a tree planted by the water
I shall not be moved

I shall not, I shall not be moved
I shall not, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree planted by the water
I shall not be moved
