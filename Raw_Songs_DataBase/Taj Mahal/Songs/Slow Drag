Said I'm tired a little, and doing my time
The judge said, Son, I give you one to 99
I give you one, give you 99
Give you one, give you 99
You know you doing time partner, cause you have done the crime

Said I'm tired of living, in this low-down prison cell
And I wouldn't have been here darling, hadn't been for Big-Legged Nel
I wouldn't have been in the hoosegow, that jailhouse, cause of Big-Legged Nel
I wouldn't have been in the jailhouse, cause it was Big-Legged Nel
She said she was from New Orleans, needed protection, cause she had something to sell

If I ever get out of this prison, I'm going to do just like I please
I'm gonna take off straight running, to the nearest bunch of trees
Baby I'm gonna be run, run, run, run, run, run, run, running to the nearest bunch of trees
I'm gonna be running, running, run, running to the nearest bunch of trees
I'm going to be running so fast, pretty baby, looks like man'll be running on his knees

Said I'm tired of living, and doing my time
The judge said, Son, give you one to 99
If I don't get no loving in the morning, before I come to chambers, give you 99
If I don't get no corn liquor before chambers in the morning, I'm gonna give you 99
You know you doing time partner, because you have done the crime
