The Calypsonians were all gathered together, singing such a mournful tune
I don't know if it was in the summer time could be the month of May or June
Believe me Baby now I love you the best
When I by myself I poke out me chest
Over lovin', lovin lovin, can't stop loving you

I do believe down to my soul I'm going to take accross the deep blue sea
Like my friend Carlos on the Hokule'a down to old Fiji
Believe me Baby now I love you the best
When I by myself I poke out me chest
Over lovin', lovin lovin, can't stop loving you

Love me baby, baby love me, love me baby thru and thru
Love me in the night time, darling from moon to moon
Believe me Baby now I love you the best
When I by myself I poke out me chest
Over lovin', lovin lovin, can't stop loving you

If you love me like you say you love me, love like you say you do
Love me in the sunshine, darling from moon to moon
Believe me Baby now I love you the best
When I by myself I poke out me chest
Over lovin', lovin lovin, can't stop loving you

The blues chaed up a rabbit, rabbit run a quarter mile
That poor little furry bunny scared like a little child
Believe me Baby now I love you the best
When I by myself I poke out me chest
Over lovin', lovin lovin, can't stop loving you

The Calypsonians were all gathered together, singing such a mournful tune
I don't know if it was in the summer time could be the month of May or June
Believe me Baby now I love you the best
When I by myself I poke out me chest
Over lovin', lovin lovin, can't stop loving you
