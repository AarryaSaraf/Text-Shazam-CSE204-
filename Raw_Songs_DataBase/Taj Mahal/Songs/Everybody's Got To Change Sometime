Change in the ocean, change in deep blue sea
Well, there's a change in my baby, but there ain't never no change in me
Yeah, everybody they ought to change sometime
Because sooner or later, mama, you gonna end up in some lonesome ground

Now, change my shirt, you know, and I change my money
I change my woman just to keep from actin' funny
Yeah, everybody they ought to change sometime
'Cause you know, sooner or later we gonna end up in in some lonesome ground

Change my numbers on my door
So my baby can't find out where I live no more
Yeah, everybody they ought to change sometime
'Cause you know, sooner or later we gonna end up in a burial ground

Change in the mountain, you know, change in the land
But there ain't never no change in me, baby, 'cause I'm a natural man
You know, yeah, everybody ought to change sometime
Because if they don't change, they gonna end up in in that lonesome ground

Yeah, there's a change in the ocean, change in the deep blue sea
Well, there's a change in my baby, but there ain't never no change in me
Yeah, everybody they ought to change sometime
'Cause you know, sooner or later, you gonna end up in a lonesome ground
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
You gotta change it. Make it, make it, make it feel right
Don't let you sleep, john, change it, change it, make things be all right
