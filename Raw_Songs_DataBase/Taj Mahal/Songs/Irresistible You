Your magic hands
Your lovin' eyes
Your kissable lips
Makes my heart realize
I'm in love, I'm in love
And you know it's true
Tell me, who-o-o, wouldn't fall for irresistible you

I don't know what you got
But it's got me and I'm hooked
Like a fish in the sea
You make eagles call from above
Make the Devil fall in love
Who-o-o, wouldn't fall for irresistible you

Oh, come on
Lets dance awhile
I wanna talk...
To you child...
You been blessed...
So much, too much...
There is a wonder of love in your touch

Don't ever fret
Don't you worry about me, I never regret
How much you mean to me
I love you, I love you
My whole life through
Tell me, who-o-o, wouldn't fall for irresistible you

Don't you ever fret
Don't you worry about me I never regret
How much you mean to me
I love you, I love you
My whole life through
But tell me, who-o-o, wouldn't fall for irresistible you
