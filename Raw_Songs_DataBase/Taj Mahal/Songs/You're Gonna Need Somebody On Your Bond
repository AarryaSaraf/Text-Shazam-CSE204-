You're gonna need somebody on your bond, child
You're gonna need somebody on your bond
When it's late 'round midnight and old man
Death comes slippin' into the room
You're gonna need somebody on your bond

You take Mary and Martha standin' up in the hillside
Mary explainin' to Martha, "Darlin', look at the river deep and the water wide"
Here comes ole Moses, faithful Moses carryin' big ole stones up the hill
Tellin' everybody they're gonna need somebody on their bond

Whoa, you take Mavis Staples and ole Corn Cheevers 
They got the good side on their bond
Oh, I been listen to the music people ever since the day I was born
My momma raised me in a room across from the church by the tree

And that sweet gospel music, oh how it used to comfort me
Tellin' everybody they're gonna need somebody on their bond
