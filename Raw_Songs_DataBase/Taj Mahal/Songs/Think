Think, think about the good things
Think, think about the bad things
Think, think about the right things
Think, think about the wrong things

And lady before you leave me you'll realize
I'm the one that loves you

Think about the sacrifices that I made for you
Think about the hard times that you put me through
Think about the good things that I done for you
Think about the bad things I tried not to do

Come on cheer me
Think, think about the good things
Think, think about the bad things
Think, think about the right things
Think, think about the wrong things

Lady, before you leave me you'll realize
That I'm the one that loves you

Come on cheer me now
Think, think about the good things
Think, think about the bad things
Think, think about the right things
Think, think about the wrong things

And lady before you leave me you'll realize
That I'm the one that loves you

How much of the happiness can you really claim?
How many tears have you shed, for what you're to blame?
Though I can't remember just what went wrong
I tried so hard to please you, at least that's what I thought

Come on cheer me now
Think, think about the good things
Think, think about the bad things
Think, think about the right things
Think, think about the wrong things

And lady before you leave me you'll realize
I, I'm the one that loves you

Lady before you leave me you'll realize
That I, I'm the one that loves you
