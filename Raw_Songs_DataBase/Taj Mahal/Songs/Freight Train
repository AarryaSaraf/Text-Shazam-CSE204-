This country has a great history of railroads
You know, goin' from one place to another
And some of our country's finest citizens lived across the tracks
It was no big thing but the railroad had a lot to do with it
You probably wondering about what I'm talking right now
I'm talkin' about a lady named Elizabeth Cotton
She wrote this song a long time ago when she was a young girl
She's still playin' guitar today and I'm gonna sing a few lines for you
We love you Elizabeth, love you Elizabeth

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
I don't know what train I'm on
Won't you tell me where I'm goin'?

When I die bury me deep
Down at the end of old Chestnut street
Tell all the people that I've done gone
And where I've gone I just don't know

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
I don't know what train I'm on
So won't you tell me where I'm goin'?
