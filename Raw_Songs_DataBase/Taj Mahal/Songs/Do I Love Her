Do I love her? yes, I love her, and she love me and I hope she will
Do I love her? yes, I love her, and she love me and she love me still
She got me jumping like a Jack on a Jenny
High behind the hill

Do I need you? yes, I need you, honey, I told you so
Do I want you? yes, I want you, honey, want to let you know
Now you make me higher
Deep down in my soul

Well
When I love you, yes, I love you, gonna give you praise
Yes, I love you, whoa, I love you, and I won't be afraid
'Cause my arms they're around you
Baby, every day

Over mountain, over valley, over hill and dale
Over ocean, big blue ocean, I will sail
I'm gonna be your love man like a gator, baby, I'm gonna drag my tail

Wave your jack of diamonds when you rob my pocket of silver and gold
Jack of diamonds, oh, you rob my pocket of silver and gold
I... just had to let it, let it go

Muddy Waters, no kidding Muddy Waters gone to his grave
Muddy Waters, Muddy Waters gone to the great big
Blues in Chicago 
Aww...
Whoa ooh...

Yeah, do I love her? yes, I love her, baby, and I always will
Do I need her? yes, I need her, baby, and I need her still
She got me going like a Jack on a Jenny
Baby, high behind the hill
Smoke that harmonica...
