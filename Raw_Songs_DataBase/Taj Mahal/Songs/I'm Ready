Well, I'm ready, I'm willin', and I'm able to rock and roll all night
I'm ready, I'm willin', and I'm able to rock and roll all night
Come on, pretty baby, we gonna rock, we gonna roll until the broad daylight

Because I'm ready, mm-mm-mm
And I'm able, mm-mm-mm
I'm willin' and I'm able so you better come and go with me
We gonna rock and roll till tomorrow bout three

Talkin' on the phone is not my speed
Don't send me no letter cause I can't read
Don't be long cause I'll be gone
We gonna rock and roll all night long

Cause I'm ready, I'm willin', and I'm able to rock and roll all night
I'm ready, I'm willin', and I'm able to rock and roll all night
Come on, pretty baby, we gonna rock, we gonna roll until tomorrow night

Talkin' on the phone is not my speed
Don't send me no letter cause I can't read
Don't be long cause I'll be gone
We gonna rock and roll all night long

Cause I'm ready, I'm willin', and I'm able to rock and roll all night
I'm ready, I'm willin', and I'm able to rock and roll all night
Come on, pretty baby, we gonna rock, we gonna roll until tomorrow night
