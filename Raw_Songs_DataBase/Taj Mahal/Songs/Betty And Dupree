Betty told Dupree she wanna diamond ring
Betty told Dupree she wanna diamond ring
Dupree told Betty: Baby, I'll buy you anything

Dupree told Betty: Baby, won't you be my wife
Dupree told Betty: Baby, won't you be my wife
She said, "I'm yours, I'm yours, I'm yours, for the rest of my life"

Put your arms around me, baby, honey, like a circle around the sun
Put your arms around me, baby, like a circle around the sun
Put your big strong arms around my waist, let it slide down on the one

Love me, baby, love me to the bone
Won't you love me, baby, honey, love me deep down in my bones
I will love you so good, that you can't stand to leave me alone

Kiss me, baby, right on my ruby lips
Kiss me, baby, honey, on my ruby lips
Put your big strong arms around my waist, and let it slide down on my hips

Yeah, yeah, Betty told Dupree, she wanna diamond ring
Betty told Dupree, she wanna diamond ring
And Dupree said: Betty, I'm gonna buy you anything
