Checkin' up on my baby
To find out what she been puttin' down
Checkin' up on my baby
Find out what she been puttin' down
So many nights and days
A-since I been, last been in this town

I had me a little job
Playin' down a way
Yes, I had me a little job
I was playin' down a way
Well, you know I wasn't feelin' too good
Well, I wanted to hear somethin' my baby say

Well, you know I didn't even call her, I didn't even write
No, I didn't send her a telegram
No, I didn't even call her, I didn't even write
And I didn't send her a telegram
Yes, you know my baby
She didn't know just where I was

I'm checkin' up on my baby
To find out what's goin' down
Checkin' up on my baby
To find out what's goin' on down
Ah, so many nights and days
Since I left, ah, your town

Nah, listen here now

I'm checkin' up on my baby
Find out what she been puttin' down
Checkin' up on my baby
Find out what she been puttin' down
So many nights and days
Mmm, I been away from her 'n' her town

I'm workin' down the road
I didn't know if things was goin' right
Oh, I'm workin' down the road
Down the coast, I didn't things was workin' right
So, you know I took a train
And come back to my baby that night
Checkin' up on her
