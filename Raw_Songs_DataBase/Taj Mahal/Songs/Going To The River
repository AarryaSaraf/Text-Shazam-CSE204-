I'm going to the river
Gonna go overboard and drown
I'm going to the river
Gonna jump overboard and drown
Because the gal I love
She just have left this town

When she left me
I bowed my head and cried
When she left me
I bowed my head and cried
I never thought I would be
I would be the one to cry

Well, if you see my mama
Tell her goodbye for me
If you see my mama
Tell her goodbye for me
I'm tired of living
Living in misery
