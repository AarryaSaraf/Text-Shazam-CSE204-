Senor Blues is what they call him
Way down Mexicali way
Senoritas fallin' for him
With the hope that he will stay
By the time that they love him
Senor Blues done gone away

Well, he's tall and good lookin'
And he always knows just what to say
Yes, he's tall and good lookin'
And he always knows just what to say
By the time that they love him
Senor Blues done gone away
