Now-ow, if you wanna love that woman
A-you love her with a thrill
'Cause-a if you don't
A-some other man will

You've got to love her with a feeling
You got to love her with a feeling
Love her with a feeling, man
Or don't you love at all

She shakes all over
A-when she walks
She made a blind man see
She made a, a dumb man talk

You know she love me with a feeling
A-love me with a feeling
Love me with a feeling, baby
Or don't you love at all

The cops took her in
How that woman didn't need no bail
How she wiggled one time for the judge
And the judge put the cops in jail

You know you love me with a feeling
A-love me with a feeling
Love me with a feeling, baby
Or don't you love at all
