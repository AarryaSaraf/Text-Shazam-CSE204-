Bet your going fishing all of the time
Baby going fishing too
Bet your life, your sweet wife
Will catch more fish than you

Many fish bites if you got good bait
Here's a little tip that I would like to relate
Many fish bites if you got good bait
I'm a going fishing, yes, I'm going fishing
And my baby going fishing too

I went on down to my favorite fishing hole
Baby grabbed me a pole and a line
Throwed my pole on in, caught a nine pound catfish
You know I brought him home for supper time
Proving any fish bites if you got good bait
Here's a little tip that I would like to relate

Many fish bites if you've got good bait
I'm a going fishing, yes, I'm going fishing
And my baby goin' fishin' too

Baby brother 'bout to run me up out of my mind
Saying, "Can I go fishing with you?"
I took him on down to the fishing hole
Now, what do you think that he did do?
Pulled a great big fish out the bottom of the pond
Now he laughed and jumped cause he was real gone

Many fish bites if you've got good bait
I'm a going fishing, yes, I'm going fishing
And my baby goin' fishin' too

Put him in the pot baby, put him in the pan
Honey, cook him 'til he's nice and brown
Make a batch of buttermilk hoecakes Mama
And you chew them things and you chomp 'em on down
Singing any fish bites if you got good bait
Here's a little tip that I would like to relate

Many fish bites if you got good bait
I'm a going fishing, yes, I'm going fishing
And my baby going fishing too

Play the blues...

Bet you're going fishing all of the time
Baby going fishing too
Bet your life, your sweet wife
She going to catch more fish than you

Many fish bites if you got good bait
Oh, here's a little tip that I would like to relate
Many fish bites if you got good bait
I'm a going fishing, mama's going fishing
And the baby going fishing too
