Whoo
At last, at last
I found a love for me
At last, at last
Oh, I found a love for me

Into my life she came, people
A life full of misery
Bringing in with her the sunshine
To warm the very soul of me

At last, at last
Oh, I found a love for me
Ooh, you believe me, at last
Oh, I found a love for me

(One more thing)
I knew right away
As soon as our eyes first met
That her heart and mine
Would soon entwine
Into a love no one would ever forget

Aah, at last
Oh, I found a love for me
Yeah, at last
I found a love for me
Yeah

Whoo...
Your love, your love
Your love, your love is mine
She's sweet, so sweet
And she the apple of my eye
Her lips, yeah, look like two rubies
And she stands about so high
When she kisses me I'm feeling thunder
Oww, yeah, yeah
A love me

Oh, everybody needs someone to love
I'm so glad that I found mine
There's someone somewhere for everyone
And it's only a matter of time
Before you say it

At last
Oh, I found a love for me
Baby, at last, yeah
I found a love for me
