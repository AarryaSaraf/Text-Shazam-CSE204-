I got a gal who's always late
Anytime we have a date
But I love her
Yes I love her

I'm gonna walk right up to her gate
And see if I can get it straight
'Cause I want her
I'm gonna ask her

Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
The way you're acting, baby, make me doubt
Yous is still my baby, baby
Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out

Yeah, a woman is a creature
That has always been strange
Just when you're sure of one
You find she's gone and made a change

Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
Well, maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true?

Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
The way you're acting lately makes me doubt
Tell me, is yous still my baby, baby?
Honey, seems my flame in your heart's done gone out

Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still?
Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
My baby, my baby, my baby...

Baby!
