Well, I heard about the fella you've been dancing with
All over the neighbourhood
So why didn't you ask me baby
Or didn't you think I could

Well, I know that the Boogiloo is out of sight
But the Shingaling she's paying tonight
But if that were you and me out there baby
I would have shown you how to do right

Do it ri-ight, ah-hah, do it ri-ight
Do it right... do it right... do it right...

Ahhh-ah, twistin', shake-it, shake-it, shake-it, shake-it baby-y
Here we go loop-dee-loop, shake it up baby
Here we go loop-dee-li
Bend over, let me see you shake your tail feather
Bend over, let me see you shake your tail feather
Come on, let me see you shake your tail feather
Come on, let me see you shake your tail feather

Ahhh-ah, twistin', shake-it, shake-it, shake-it, shake-it baby
Here we go loop-dee-loop, shake it up baby
Here we go loop-dee-li
Bend over, let me see you shake your tail feather
Bend over, let me see you shake your tail feather
Come on, let me see you shake your tail feather
Come on, let me see you shake your tail feather

Ahhh-ah, come on, come on baby
Come o-on, yeah-eah, come on babe
Alright, do The Twist, do The Fly, oh
Do The Swim, hah-hah-hah, and do The Bird
Woh do The Jerk and do The Monkey
Hey-hey, Watoosie and uh, what about The Fool
Do The Mash Potata, what about the Boogiloo
Or the Boney Moroney, come on and do The Twist

Ahhh-ahhh, twisti-in', shake-it, shake-it, shake-it, shake-it baby-y-y
Twisti-in', skake-it, shake-it, shake-it
