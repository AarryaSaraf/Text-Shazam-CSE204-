The night was clear and the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down
I was standin' on the corner
When I heard my bull dog bark
He was barkin' at the two men
Who were gamblin' in the dark

Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw a seven
Billy swore that he threw an eight

Stagger Lee told Billy
I can't let you go with that
You have won all my money
And my brand new stetson hat

Stagger Lee went home
And he got his forty four
Said, I'm gonna to the bar
Just to pay that debt I owe

Blew them, six
Stagger Lee, Stagger Lee

Stagger Lee went to the bar room
And he stood across the bar room door
Said, now, nobody move
Then he pulled his forty four

Stagger Lee, cried Billy
Ohh, please don't take my life
I've got three little children
And a very sickly wife

Well, Stagger Lee shot Billy
Ohh, he shot that poor boy so bad
So the bullet came through Billy
And it broke the bartender's glass

Hate that thing on most hands
Stagger Lee, Stagger Lee

Go, Stagger Lee, go, Stagger Lee
Go, Stagger Lee, go, Stagger Lee
Go, Stagger Lee

Go, Stagger Lee, go, Stagger Lee
Go, Stagger Lee, go, Stagger Lee
Go, Stagger Lee, go, Stagger Lee
Go, Stagger Lee

Go, Stagger Lee, go, Stagger Lee
Go, Stagger Lee, go, Stagger Lee
