I know it's hard to love a gypsy
Please, don't worry, baby
'Cause I'll soon be coming home to you

And if I steal away
Steal away like a thief in the night
It's only 'cause I hate to say that long goodbye to you

I know there ain't nowhere
Nowhere can compare
With the comfort of your big brass bed
But I've got a long road to travel
And only a hard and stony ground
For me to rest my weary head

I'm like a fish out of water
Feel like I'm drowning on dry land
If I ain't got a reservation ticket
Right here in the palm of my hand

I'm a 21st century gypsy
21st century gypsy singin' lover man

And when I kiss you goodnight
In the dark hours of the morning
And pack a guitar bag
And head on out the door
I know that you know that I really hate to leave you

But it's that time again and I simply got to go
And if I'm away on the road for weeks on end
In some way off and far flung foreign land
Sailing an ocean or deep down in the jungle
Or in a caravan crossing the burning desert land

I follow a spirit that's been roaming free
Way way back since time began
I was a wandering minstrel in a previous life
Now I'm your 21st century
21st century gypsy singin' lover man

I'm like a fish out of water
I'm drowning on dry land
If I ain't got a reservation ticket
Right here in the palm of my hand

I'm your 21st century gypsy singin' lover man
