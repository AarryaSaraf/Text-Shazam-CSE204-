Good morning Miss Brown
Mamma how do you do?
I said good morning Miss Brown
Mamma how do you do?
She say I'm feelin' fine and lookin' good
Man what about you?

I say I got the misery and the back ache baby
And my feet's hurtin' me when I walk
You know I got the misery and the back ache baby
And my feet's hurtin' me when I walk
And you know too much conversation hurt my tongue to talk

I laid down last night
I tried to take my night's rest
Oh baby you know, I laid down last night
I tried to take my natural rest
You know my heart start a wandering
Just like the wild geese in the west

The blues jumped a rabbit
Rabbit run a quarter mile
Yes the blues jumped up a rabbit
Rabbit run for a quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter mile
You know that poor little furry bunny
Scared just like a baby child
And if you ain't scared
Man you ain't right!

Good morning Miss Brown
Mamma how do you do?
Good morning Miss Brown
Mamma how do you do?
Well she say I'm doin' fine daddy tell me
Man, how 'bout you?
