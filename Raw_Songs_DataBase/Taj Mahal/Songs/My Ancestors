My ancestors
Were kings of old
Hey, they ruled the world
And all of its gold
You can look at me
Hey, yeah, look at me
Yeah, yeah, look at me
Uh

My ancestors
Would fight the sun
Before they bowed down
To anyone
You have to look at me
Hey yeah, look at me
Ah, look at me
Ooh, look at me
I'm a stranger in this land
Well, watch me grow tall
Oh, help me to be a man
Hey
Hey, yeah!

My ancestors
They were mighty men
Yeah, and my son, he will be one of them
And people will look at him
Oh, hey, look at him
Oh, hey, look at him
And say he's a man
Oh, he's a man
My son's a man

My ancestors
They pushed it on to me, oh
They pushed it on to me, oh
Oh, and I'm gonna push it on to you
And then my son will be a man
A man
My son will be a man
Ooh
Oh yeah
