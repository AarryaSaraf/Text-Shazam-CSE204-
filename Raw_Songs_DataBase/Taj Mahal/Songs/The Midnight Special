Oh, let the midnight special
Shine her light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine her ever loving light on me

Yonder come miss Rosie
How in the world do you know?
Now you know her by her apron
And the dress she wore
Umbrella on her shoulder
Piece of paper in her hand
She's gonna see the governor
She wants to release her man

Oh, let the midnight special
Shine her light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine her ever loving light on me

(Yes sir)

When you get up in the mornin'
And the big bell ring
You go marchin' to the table
Well, it's the same old thing
Ain't no food upon the table
And nothin' in the pan
If you say anything about it
You get in trouble with the man

Let the midnight special
Shine her light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine her ever loving light on me
(Let's go!)

(Yes sir)

If you ever go to Houston
Well, you better walk right
You better not squabble
And you better not fight
That cop will arrest you
And he'll sure take you down
And you can bet your bottom dollar
You're jailhouse bound

Let the midnight special
Shine her light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine her ever loving light on me

(Yes sir)

Oh, let the midnight special
Shine the light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine the ever loving light on me
Oh, let the midnight special
Shine her light on me
Let the midnight special
Shine her ever loving light on me
