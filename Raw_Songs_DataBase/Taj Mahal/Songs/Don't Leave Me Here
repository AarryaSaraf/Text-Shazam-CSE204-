How the weather in the country?
How the weather down south?
How the weather in the Delta?
How the food taste in your mouth?
Butter beans and cornbread, grits and greens
Candied yams and black eyed peas

If you're going to Mississippi
Where that Delta sky is sweet and clear
Ooh, y'all, I'm stuck here in Chicago
Please don't leave me here

When you see Ludella, tell her hey for me
Last time I saw her, it was in my dreams
She's the sweetest thing under the sun
When I think about some lovin', she's still the one

Now if you're going to Mississippi
Where that Delta sky is sweet and clear
Well you know, I'm stuck here in Chicago
Please don't leave me here

What they doin' in Vicksburg down in Aberdeen?
They got more fine big-legged women
Than any one man ever seen
What they doin' in Jackson and little old Itta Bena?
I ain't been to Clarksdale since 1963

'Cause if you're going to Mississippi
Where that Delta sky is sweet and clear
Y'all, I'm stuck here in Chicago
Please don't leave me here

How the weather in the Delta?
Sure cold up here
Baby run off and left me late last year
It was just before Christmas
Deep, deep snow on the ground
Came home later in the evening
She done tore my playhouse down

So if you're going to Mississippi
Where that Delta sky is sweet and clear
Ooh, y'all, I'm stuck here in Chicago
Please don't leave me here

Don't leave
Please don't leave me here, mmm
Please don't leave, ooh
Please don't leave me here

Ooh, well I'll be
Please don't leave me here
Please don't leave me
Please don't leave me here

Please don't leave me
Please don't leave me here
Please don't leave
