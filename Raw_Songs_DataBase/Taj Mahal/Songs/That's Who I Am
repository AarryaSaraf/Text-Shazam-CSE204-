I'm a preacher, I'm a sinner
I'm a loser, I'm a winner
I got everything, I got nothing
But I'm a fool for some real good loving
I was looking for myself when I found you
And your love was all around
Now I can't see my life without you
Oh, that's who I am
That's who I am
Right now

I'm a lover, I'm a fighter
I'm a reader, and I'm a writer
I got a ball, and I got a chain
But I'm free of misery and pain
I was looking for myself when I found you
And your love was all around
Now I can't see my life without you
That's who I am
That's who I am

I'm ready to surrender
To you and I together, babe
The way your love has changed me
Will stay with me forever

And I was looking for myself when I found you
Your love's all around
Now I can't see my life without you
And that's who I am
That's who I am
Yeah, that's who I am
That's who I am
Oh yeah, that's who I am, yeah baby
That's who I am
Right now
