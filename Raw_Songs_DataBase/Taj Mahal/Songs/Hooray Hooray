I met a pretty little girl
Walking down the avenue
 hey old Sonny
Can I come home with you?
We're gonna rock the house tonight
Everything will be alright

Hooray, hooray
The woman is killing me
Hooray, hooray
The woman is killing me
If you don't believe it
Wait right here and see

Yeah, now we walk till midnight
Rock till the break of dawn
Yeah, we dance till midnight
Rocking till the break of dawn
Won't you cool down?
Sonny gonna keep you warm

Oh, baby, it's five o'clock
What you gonna do?
Yeah, it's five o'clock
Oh, what you gonna do?
I don't care, I've been hurting
I'm gon' leave it up to you
And that's when I told her

Hooray, hooray
The woman is killing me
Hooray, hooray
The woman is killing me
If you don't believe it
Wait right here and see

I'm gonna lock this door
And throw that key away
Yes, I'm gonna lock the door
And throw that key away
I ain't coming home
Stay right here all day

Hooray, hooray
The woman is killing me
Hooray, hooray
The woman is killing me
If you don't believe it
Wait right here and see

Hooray, hooray
The woman is killing me
Hooray, hooray
The woman is killing me
If you don't believe it
Wait right here and see
