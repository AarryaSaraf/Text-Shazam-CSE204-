You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else
In and out my life
You come and you go, go, go
Leavin' just your picture behind, baby
I kissed it a thousand times

When you snap your fingers and wink your eye
I come a running to you
I'm tied to your apron string, baby
And there's nothing that I can't do

Sugarpie honeybunch
I'm weaker than a man should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love you see

Tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through
Honey I'm not tryin', I've tried
But every time I see your face, baby
Oh, I get all choked up inside

When I call your name
Girl, it starts the flame
Burnin' in my heart, tearin' me apart
No matter how I try, my love I cannot hide

Sugarpie honeybunch
 I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

Sugarpie honeybunch
Honey, I'm weak for you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else, baby
