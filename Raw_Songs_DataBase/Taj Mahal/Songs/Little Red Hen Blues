Well, li'l red hen said to li'l red rooster
You don't come round here much as you used to
Now, hone,y you long gone
Baby, you long gone, oh, you long gone
Just like a turkey through the corn

Ole grey mule said to the ole grey hen
Honey, now tell me where that rooster of yours have been
She said, he long gone, say, he long gone, oh, he long gone
Baby, like a turkey through the corn

Oh, that sweet gray goat say to that ole fat mule
You know people 'round here been talkin', tellin' me that you a fool
But they long gone, yes, they long gone, oh, they long gone
Honey, like a turkey through the corn

I been up North and I been down South an' I been to the Cas
I like the West and South the best
An I'll be long gone, yes, I'm long gone, I'm long gone
Honey, like a turkey through the corn

Tell me, baby, what's on your mind
I can see by your eyes that you ain't been cryin'
An' I been long gone, I been long gone, I been long gone
Honey, like a turkey through the corn

How you know the men don't like me 'cause I speak my mind
And the women crazy 'bout me 'cause I take my time
An I'm long gone, honey, I'm long gone, I'm long gone
Baby, just like a turkey through the corn

Well, li'l red hen said to li'l red rooster
You don't come round here much as you used to
Now, hone,y you long gone
Baby, you long gone, oh, you long gone
Just like a turkey through the corn

Well, you can take my potatoes up out that ground
Can put 'em in my oven, turn your damper down
Mama, now you know I'm long gone, honey, I'm long gone
I'm long gone, baby, like a turkey through the corn
