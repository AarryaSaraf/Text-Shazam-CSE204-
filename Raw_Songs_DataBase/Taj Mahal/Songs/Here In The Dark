Well, I'm here in the dark
And I can't see the light of day
Yes, I'm here in the dark
And I can't see the light of day


Well, I'm here in the dark
And I'm feeling so very blue
Yes, I'm here in the dark
And I'm feeling so very blue
Oh yes, its cold outside
And the rain is falling too

Well, I'm here in the night
And in my heart I feel so sad
Yes, I'm here in the night
And in my heart I feel so sad
I've lost my only love
Oh, the blues I've got them bad
