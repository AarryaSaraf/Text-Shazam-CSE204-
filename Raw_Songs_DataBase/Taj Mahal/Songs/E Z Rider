Easy rider, oh you rider
Baby, won't you see what you gone and done
You done gone and left me
While I lay sleepin'
Baby, now you know your natural man done come
Baby, now you know your natural man done come

Well, I'm going to the country
Back to the country
Yes, I'm gonna stay there for a little while
You know I ain't good-looking
But don't let that deceive you
I'm some woman's sweet angel-child
Baby, you know I'm some woman's sweet
Some woman's angel-child

Mmm, when you see me come
Baby, when you see me comin'
Won't you throw your man, your man outdoors
You know I ain't no stranger to you, baby
I been in your sweet lovin'-arms before
Baby, I been in your sweet lovin' arms before
Work, baby-child, come on, do it to me

Oh, look here, rider
See here, baby
Honey, where did you, where did you stay last night?
You know your hair's all tangled
And your dress is all messy
And the shoes you wear, you ain't got 'em on right
Baby, the shoes you been wearin', you ain't got 'em on right

Woh-oh-oh-oh
Easy rider, oh you easy rider
Baby, won't you see what you gone and done
You done gone and left me
While I lay sleepin'
Baby, now you know your man done come
Baby, now you know your man done come

Come on! Oh you rider
Yes, you hurt me, rider
Girl, you put me on the killin' floor
Girl, you put me on the killin' floor
Yes, you hurt me, rider
Come on! You know you hurt me, rider
Got, got to, got to tell ya 'bout it
Got to testify to ya, baby
Yes, ya hurt me, rider
Oh, you hurt me, rider
