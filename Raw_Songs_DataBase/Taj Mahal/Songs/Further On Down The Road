Further on down the road, baby
You will accompany me
Further on down the road, baby
You will accompany me

When I look back
Your love was like the sun
And I don't remember no cold days
Just the warm warm fun
Further on down the road, baby
You will accompany me

If we fools in life, than a happy fool I would rather be
I'll be glad to learn from you
And I know you will be glad to learn from me

If we get down, if we get sad
We can cheer up each other cuz things just ain't so bad
If we fools in life, than a happy fool I would rather be

Day by day, baby, just one step at a time
Cuz woman, you have given me so much
Just to ease this stubborn little achin' heart of mine

I don't care where they came from
And I don't care what they might say
Woman, you've been lovin' in my corner
All... all the way, baby

Further on down the road, baby
You will accompany me
Further on down the road, baby
You will accompany me

When I look back
Your love was like the sun
And I don't remember no cold days
Just the warm warm fun

Honey, you will accompany me...
