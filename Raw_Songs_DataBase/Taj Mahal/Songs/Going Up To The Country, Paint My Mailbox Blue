Gonna move up to the country
Paint my mailbox blue
Gonna move up to the country
Paint my mailbox blue
Put some flowers on it baby
Paint some trailin' vines and dew

You know I'm leavin' LA baby
Don't you know this smog's got me down
I'm leavin' LA baby
Don't you know this smog has got me down
I'm goin' up to the canyon
Where there ain't nobody else around

Come here baby
Mama, let me take you, take you by yo' hand
Come here baby
Mama, let daddy take you by yo' hand
You be my woman
And I will be your city-boy, country man

I'm gonna move up to the country
Gonna paint, gonna paint, gonna paint, my mailbox blue
Move up to the country
Gonna paint my mailbox blue
Put some flowers on it honey
Paint some trailin' vines and dew
