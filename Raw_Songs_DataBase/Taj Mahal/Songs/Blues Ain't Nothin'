Blues ain't nuthin but a woman lookin for a man
Blues ain't nuthin but a woman lookin for a man
Honey she can't love him when she wanna
She go to love him when he can

Blues ain't nuthin but a lowdown shakin chill
Blues ain't nuthin but a lowdown shakin chill
You got to grab man when you can baby
And love him when you will

She might be down in the church house kneelin' down to pray
Down in the church house kneelin' down to pray
She been lovin' that man
Drove her heart insane

Blues ain't nuthin but a woman lovin' a married man
Blues ain't nuthin but a woman lovin' a married man
Honey she can't get him when she want him
She got to love him when he can

She left him walkin fast - cryin didn't have nuthin to say
Walkin' fast - didn't have nuthin to say
You know the woman be here in the morning
Oh she won't be back today

I'm gonna sing it new time for muddy water, singin deep down in the blue
Sing it for muddy water, singin deep down in the blue
Oh muddy did 'em first
Honey now I'm gonna do 'em too

My horse gone lame, believe you done gone blind
My horse gone lame, believe you done gone blind
I wouldn't be here in the mornin baby
Might get back in a coupla days time
