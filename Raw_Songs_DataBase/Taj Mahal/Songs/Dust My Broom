I'm gettin' up soon in the mornin', baby
Believe I'll dust my broom
Yes, I'm gettin' up soon, early in the mornin'
Believe I'll dust my broom
Well, you know, I've quit the best girl I've been lovin'
You know my friends can have my room

And I didn't want no woman
With every downtown man you see
No, I don't want no woman
With every downtown man you see
'Cause you know she no-good doney
They shouldn't allow that woman runnin' 'round the street

I'm gon' write a letter, baby
Telephone every town I know
I'm gon' write a letter
Telephone every town I know
If she ain't in West Helena, Arkansas
She in East Monroe, I know

I believe, baby
I believe my time ain't long
I believe
I believe my time ain't long
Well, you know, I done quit the best girl I've loved
And broke up my happy home
