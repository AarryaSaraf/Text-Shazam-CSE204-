Mama's got a squeeze box
She wears on her chest
And when Daddy comes home
He never gets no rest

'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box
And Daddy don't sleep at night

Well, the kids don't eat
And the dog don't sleep
There's no escape from the music
In the whole damn street

'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box
And Daddy never sleeps at night

She's going in and out and in and out, in and out and in and out
She's going in and out and in and out

Cause' she's playing all night
And the music's all tight
Mama's got a squeeze box
And Daddy don't sleep at night

She goes, squeeze me, come on and squeeze me
Come on and tease me like you do
I'm so in love with you
You know, Mama's got a squeeze box
And Daddy don't sleep at night

She's going in and out and in and out, in and out and in

'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box
And Daddy don't sleep at night

'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy don't sleep at night

She's going in and out and in and out, in and out and in
In and out and in and out, in and out and in
She goes in and out and in and out, in and out and in
