The riverbank makes a very good road
The dead trees will show you the way
Left foot, peg foot traveling on
Follow the drinking gourd

The river ends between two hills
Follow the drinking gourd
There's another tree on the other side
Follow the drinking gourd

When the great big river meets the little river
Follow the drinking gourd
For the old man is waiting for to carry you to freedom
If you follow the drinking gourd

When the sun comes back and the first quail cries
Follow the drinking gourd
For the old man is waiting for to carry you to freedom
If you follow the drinking gourd
