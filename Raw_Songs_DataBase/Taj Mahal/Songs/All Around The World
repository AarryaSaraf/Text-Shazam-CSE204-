What's all the fuss about?
Why can't people just get along?
Maybe we oughta talk about
All the good we got goin' on
Everybody knows there's a better way
Everyone hopin' and prayin' that one day

There'll be love all around the world (All around the world)
There'll be peace and understanding (All around the world)
There'll be joy all around the world (All around the world)
There'll be happy children singin' (All around the world)

Can't you just feel it everywhere
It's a powerful spirit up in the air
Won't be no reason to sing the blues
And there won't be nothin' on the radio
But some good news

There'll be love all around the world (All around the world)
There'll be peace and understanding (All around the world)
There'll be joy all around the world (All around the world)
There'll be happy children singin' (All around the world)

You know we're gonna bring about
A positive change
I can't help thinkin' about
How it keeps on gettin' so strange
How do we get away
From the misery and pain
And still feel the sunshine
In the pourin' rain?

And have love all around the world (All around the world)
There'll be peace and understanding (All around the world)
There'll be joy all around the world (All around the world)
There'll be happy children singin' (All around the world)
Yeah, there gonna be some love
Yeah, love (All around the world)
There'll be peace and understanding (All around the world)
There'll be joy all around the world (All around the world)
There'll be happy children singin' (All around the world)
All around the
There'll be peace and understanding (There'll be dancin')
There'll be joy all around the world
Happy children singin'
Around the world
