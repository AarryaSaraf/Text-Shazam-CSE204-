I need your love every day
I need it every hour
Come on and set my little soul on fire
I say I need love, love, love, love
Need your lovin', babe, I need it every day
Come on and give it to me every hour
I want you to set my little soul on fire
Say I need love, love, love, love

I need your lovin', baby
Hear what I say, need it every day
Need it every hour
Set my little soul on fire

Now everybody needs somebody sometime

Need it every day, I wanna say it to you
Just a little bit louder
Tell you just hear what I say
I say, I need love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey baby
