Whem I walk down the street
Seems like everyone I meet
Gives me a friendly hello
Well I guess I'm just a lucky so-and-so

The birds in every tree
All sing so merrily
They sing wherever I go
I guess I'm just a lucky so-and-so

Well if you should ask me the amount in my bank account
I must confess I'm slipping
But that don't bother me, 'cause confidentially
I've got a dream that's, that's just a pippin

And when my day is through
Each night I'll hurry to
A love that's faithful, I know
I guess I'm just a lucky so-and-so
I'm so-and-so

Well if you should ask me the amount in my bank account
I must confess that I'm slipping
But that don't bother me, 'cause confidentially
I've got a dream that's a pip-pip-pippin

And when my day is through
Each night I'll hurry to
A love that's faithful, I know
I guess I'm just a lucky so-and-so
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky
Lucky so-and-so

Just lucky so-and-so
