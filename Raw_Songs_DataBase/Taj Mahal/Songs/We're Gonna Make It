We may not have a cent to pay the rent
But we're gonna make it, I know we will
We may have to eat beans everyday
But we're gonna make it, I know we will
And if a job is hard to find
And we have to stand in the welfare line
I've got your love and you know you got mine
And we're gonna make it

We may not have a home to call our own
But we're gonna make it, I know we will
We may have to fight hardships alone
We're gonna make it, I know we will
'Cause togetherness brings peace of mind
We can't stay down all of the time
I've got your love and you know you've got mine
And we're gonna make it

The car may be old our two rooms cold
But we're gonna make it, I know we will
And though we can't spare a roach a crumb
But we're gonna make it, I know
And if I have to carry around a sign
That says, "help the deaf, the dumb and the blind"
I've got your love and you know you've got mine
We're gonna make it, I know we will

We're gonna make it...
