Light rain, light rain
Baby, fallin' down
Light rain, light rain
Baby, fallin' down
Soon as it hit my windowpane
Surely hit the ground

Big, bull, bull, bull, bullfrog
Sittin' in the pond
Big, big bullfrog
Baby, sittin' in that pond
Got a white tie and coattails
Got no britches on

Goin' to Houston
Baby, see my pony run
Goin' up Houston
See my pony run
If I win some money, baby
Surely bring you some

Light rain, light rain
Baby, fallin' down
Light rain, light rain
Baby, fallin' down
Soon as it hit my windowpane, mama
Surely hit the ground
