I was in my bed a'sleepin', oh-boy, what a dream
I was in my bed sleepin', oh-boy, what a dream
I was dreamin' 'bout my TV Mama, the one with the big, wide screen

She got great big eyes and little bitty feet
And in the waist, she's so nice and neat
She's my TV Mama, one with the big, wide screen
Every time she loves me, man, she makes me scream

She just taste like candy, boys, I really go for sweets
I love her from her head down to her little bitty feet
Yeah, she's my TV Mama, one with the big, wide screen
Every time she loves me, oh yes, I'm bound to scream

I'm just kind-a rollin', tumblin', talkin' all out of my head
Well just I'm rollin' and tumblin', man, I'm talkin' all out of my head
And when my baby shook me, man, I fell right out of bed
