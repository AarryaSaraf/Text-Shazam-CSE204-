You should have never said you loved me as you laid across my folding bed
You should have never said you loved me as you laid across my folding bed
Drinkin' your white lightning, baby, talkin' all out of your head

You said, "Baby, baby, baby... buh-buh-baby, baby that's all right with me"
You said, "Duh-duh-dad, daddy, daddy... daddy that's all right with me"
You can have my juicy lovin' but don't you throw it in the deep blue sea
