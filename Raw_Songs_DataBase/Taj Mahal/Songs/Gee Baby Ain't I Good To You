Love makes me treat you the way that I do
Gee baby, ain't I good to you?
There's nothing in this whole world too good
For a girl so sweet and true
Gee baby, ain't I good to you?

Bought you a fur coat for Christmas
And a diamond ring
A big Cadillac car, and everything
What makes me treat you the way that I do?
Gee baby, ain't I good to you?

Bought you a fur coat for Christmas
And a diamond ring
A big Cadillac car, and everything
Love makes me treat you the way that I do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you?
Oh gee, baby, ain't I good to you?
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you?
