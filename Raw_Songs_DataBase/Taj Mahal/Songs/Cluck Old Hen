I got me a rooster and I put him in the barn
He stayed there and kept them old hens warm

Cluck old hen
Cluck all day
Cluck old hen
Cluck all day

I brought them eggs in to the house
Mama said they sure look fine
Cooked 'em inside and we had enough to eat
These eggs come from those hens of mine

Cluck old hen
Cluck all day
Cluck old hen
Cluck all day
