If the wife and I are fussin', brother, that's alright
'Cause me and that pretty woman got a license to fight
Why don't you mind your own business?
Why don't you mind your own business?
'Cause if you mind your own business
Then you won't be mindin' mine

Oh, the woman on the party line is such a nosy thing
She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring
Why don't you mind your own business?
Why don't you mind your own business?
'Cause if you mind your own business
Then you won't be mindin' mine

I got a pretty little girl who wears her skirts up high
The boys all whistle when she walks by
Why don't you mind your own business?
Why don't you mind your own business?
Well, if you mind your own business
Then you won't be worryin' about mine

If I wanna honky-tonk around to two or three
Now, brother, that's my headache, don't you worry about me
Why don't you mind your own business?
Why don't you mind your own business?
Well, if you mind your own business
Then you won't be worryin' about mine

Mindin' other people's business might seems to be high-toned
Got all that I can do just to mind my own
Why don't you mind your own business?
Why don't you mind your own business?
Well, if you mind your own business
Then you won't be mindin' mine

Yes, if you mind your own business
Then you'll sleep easy all the time
