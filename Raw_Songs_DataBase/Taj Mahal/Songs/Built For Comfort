Some folk built like this, some folk built like that
But the way I'm built, don't you call me fat
Because I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed
But I got everything all the good girl need

Some folk rip and run, some folk believe in signs
But if you want me, baby you got to take your time
Because I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed
But I got everything all the good girl need

I ain't have no diamond, I ain't have no gold
But I do have lovin' to satisfy your soul
Because I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed
But I got everything all you good women need
