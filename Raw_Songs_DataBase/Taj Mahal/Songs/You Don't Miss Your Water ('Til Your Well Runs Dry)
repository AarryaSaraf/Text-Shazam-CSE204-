In the beginning, baby, you really loved me
But I was too blind to really see
But now you left me, oh, how I cried
You don't miss your water, babe
Woman, 'til your well, 'til your well runs dry

I kept you crying, darling, so sad and blue
You knew all the time I was a playboy
And I just would not be true
But when you left me, baby, and it was the way you said goodbye
And I miss my water, I miss my water, I miss my water, baby
And you know my well ran dry

I sit and wonder, woman, how can this be?
You know I never thought you'd ever
Baby, you would ever leave me
But now you left me, woman, oh, how I've cried
You don't miss your water, don't miss your water, baby
Woman, 'til your well, 'til your well runs dry
You don't miss your water, baby, 'til your well runs dry

You don't miss your water, baby
No, no, no, no, you don't miss your water, baby
Mama, you just don't miss your water
Oh baby, you just don't miss your water
Woman, you just don't miss your water
Oh and you know you just don't miss your water

You just, you just don't miss your water, you just don't miss your water
No, no, you just don't miss your water, baby
How can I tell you?
How can I tell you?
You just don't miss your water, babe
You just don't, you just don't miss your water, baby
'Til your well, 'til your well runs dry
