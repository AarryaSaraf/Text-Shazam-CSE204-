I have missed you, baby
And my patience is running out
Yeah, I have missed you, baby
And my patience is running out
If you come back home, baby
I will be so happy that I could shout

When you left you took my love
And you even broke my heart
Yes, when you left you took my love
And you even broke my heart
If you come back to me, baby
We could make a brand new start

And I've loved you everyday
Even let you have your way
Won't you 
Even if you are my baby
I am so lonely, baby
So lonely I could die
If you never miss me, darling, until I say goodbye
