There's a big 'ol sound coming from the sky
Something that you can't really analyze
Like a big ol circle around the sun
There's a little 'old circle 'round everyone
Way down in the jungle, between the trees
Deep in the desert, under the sea
The wind and the rain make a sacred sound
It's way out in the country, it's in the middle of town

Om, sweet home
Om, right on!
Om, sweet home, right on, right on!

Wait a minute, let's go outside
Open up your heart and let's pray a while
Hear the world all around you, let it all in
There ain't no beginning and there ain't no end

Om, sweet home (sweet)
Om, right on!
Om, sweet home, right on, right on!

There's a big ol' sound coming from the sky
Something that you can't really analyze
When the sun goes down from dusk to dawn
And he don't really care who it shines upon

Om, sweet home (sweet)
Om, right on!
Om, sweet home, right on, right on (don't you know I'm saying)
Om, sweet home
Om, right on (right on)
Om, sweet home, right on, right on, right on (sweet home, right on, oh yeah, right on, right on)
