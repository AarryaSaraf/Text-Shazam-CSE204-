Annie's lover was a big old man, he was a farming man
Never spent much time worrying 'bout the peoples
In the big, big city

Cause all he did know about was the cows and the chickens
The pigs and the horses and the sheeps and the goats
And the ducks that fly
Sat on the hillside playing his guitar
Watching the whole thing come down in harmony

Well, Annie's lover was a big ol' man, he was a African man
He walked around and looked and saw and saw everything
That his eyes could see

Cause all he did know about was the cows and the chickens
The pigs and the horses and the sheeps and the goats and the trees
And the water and the fields and the mountains
And the blue skies and the big clouds and the ducks they fly
He sat on the hillside, playing his guitar
Watching the whole thing come down in harmony

Oh, Annie's lover was a big old man, he was a farming man
Never spent much time worry 'bout the peoples
In the big, big, big city

Cause all he did know about was the cows and the chickens
The pigs and the horses and the sheeps and the goats
And the big, big mountains and the blue skies and the water
And the big trees and the grass and the ducks they fly
He sat on the hillside, playing his guitar
Watching the whole thing come down in harmony
