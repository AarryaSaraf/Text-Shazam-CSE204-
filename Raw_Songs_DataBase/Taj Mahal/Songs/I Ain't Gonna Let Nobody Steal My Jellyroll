Ain't nobody ever gonna steal my jellyroll
Ain't nobody ever gonna steal my jellyroll
You know I'm doin' some good lovin' on a woman
She keep me satisfied deep down in my soul

I'm goin' to take you back down on the Delta peoples
Where ya, you'll hear about Hi Henry Brown - now that was a man
I'm goin' to take you back down on the Delta, baby
Back to the days of Hi Henry Brown
When he begin to play his guitar
You know all the women would let their skirts go hang on down

I'm in love with you baby
You know you're the finest woman, the finest woman here in the town
Yes, I'm in love with you baby
'Cause you're the finest woman, the finest woman here in the town
Ooh, baby now you put love solid, woman, so it will not come down

Ain't nobody ever gonna steal my jellyroll
Ain't nobody ever gonna steal my jellyroll, they can't, they can't
'Cause you know I'm lovin' on a woman
And she make me feel down, feel good down in my very soul

Now watch me call my baby

Wooh
Wooh
Wooh, baby
Wooh, mama
Wooh, wooh
