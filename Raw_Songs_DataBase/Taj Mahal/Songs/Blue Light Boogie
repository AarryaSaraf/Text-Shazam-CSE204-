They did the Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
They did the Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
I went to a party, was nothin' there but bobby socks
Went to a party, man you oughta seen 'em to reel and rock

They did the Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
They did the Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
I started rockin', man I threw my left foot out
I started swingin', somebody begin to shout

You got to Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
You got to Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low

The girls boys, they made so much noise
They even had a raid
But when the police got there all they could find
Was ice cream and lemonade
Oh, what a party
I'm so glad I didn't stay at home
Oh, what a party

They didn't treat me like I was a chaperone
They did the Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
They did the Boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low

The women had they're heads laid on their fellas' shoulders
Who were boogie-woogeyin' and squeezin' em up in the room
I couldn't see how they was dancin
Cuz their feet, they didn't move
