Have a little song
Won't take long
Sing it right
Once or twice

Oh Lordy me, didn't we shake sugaree?
Everything I got is down in pawn
Everything I got is down in pawn

Pawned my watch
Pawned my chain
Pawned everything
Even pawned my own name

Oh Lordy me, didn't we shake sugaree?
Everything I got is down in pawn
Everything I got, I got in pawn

Have a secret
I ain't gonna tell
I'm goin' to heaven
And I ain't goin' to

Oh Lordy me, didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is down in pawn
Everything I got is down in pawn

Pawned my buggy
Pawned my plough
Pawned everything
Even pawn my old cow

Oh Lordy me, didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is down in pawn
Everything I got is down in pawn

Have a secret
I ain't gonna tell
I'm goin' to heaven
In a brown pea shell

Oh Lordy me, didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got is down in pawn
Everything I got is down in pawn

Have a little song
Won't take long
Sing it right
Once or twice

Oh Lordy me, didn't I shake sugaree?
Everything I got, I got in pawn
Everything I got is down in pawn
