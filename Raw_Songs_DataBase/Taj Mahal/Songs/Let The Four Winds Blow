I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
Let me hold your hand
Try to understand
I want a girl like you
Tell my troubles to you
Don't be afraid
You've heard what I said

Let the four wind blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From the East to the West
I love you the best

Let the four wind blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From the East to the West
I love you the best

I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk
Let me hold your hand
Try to understand

I want a girl like you
Tell my troubles to you
Don't be afraid
You've heard what I said

Let the four wind blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From the East to the West
I love you the best

Let the four wind blow
Let 'em blow, let 'em blow
From the East to the West
I love you the best
