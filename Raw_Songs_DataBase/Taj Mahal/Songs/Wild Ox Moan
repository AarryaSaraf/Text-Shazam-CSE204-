Won't you come here, good woman
And listen to the wild ox moan?
Now won't you come here, good woman
And sit down on you 

I got something to tell you, good woman
Something to tell you, good woman
Well, well, can you come in my heart?

So woman, you come here, good woman
And hear this wild ox moan
Now won't you come here, good woman?
And hear this wild ox moan
