Champagne don't drive me crazy
Cocaine don't make me lazy
Ain't nobody's business but my own

Candy is dandy and liquor is quicker
You can drink all the liquor down at Costa Rica
Ain't nobody's business but your own

You can ride a great big pink Cadillac to church on Sunday
You can hang around the house with your old lady on Monday
Ain't nobody's business but your own

Man I don't care what in the world that you do
As long as you do what you say you going to
Ain't nobody's business but your own

Now, I know some of you cuties
You real fine cuties, you go stepping downtown
Just to hang around

Standing on the corner
So the fellows will stare and say
"Oh, ain't she sweet?"

Champagne don't drive me crazy
Cocaine don't make me lazy
Ain't nobody's business but my own

Candy is dandy and liquor is quicker
You can drink all the liquor down at Costa Rica
Ain't nobody's business but my own

You can walk downtown in your birthday suit
I can see you coming out of the Bank Of America with a whole lotta loot
Ain't nobody's business but your own

Now, you know that cocaine's for horses now it ain't for men
The doctors said it'll kill me but they didn't say when
Ain't nobody's business but my own

Champagne don't drive me crazy
Cocaine don't make me lazy
Ain't nobody's business but my own

Candy is dandy and liquor is quicker
You can drink all the liquor down at Costa Rica
Ain't nobody's business but my own
