I had the blues, so bad one time
It put my face in a permanent frown
Now, I'm feelin' so much better
I could cakewalk in the town

I woke up this mornin' feelin' so good
You know, I lay back down again
Throw your big leg over me, mama
I might not feel this good again

My baby, oh, my baby
I love the way she walk
When the girl gets sleepy
I love the way she baby talk

My work don't got scarce, honey
Oh  it no got hard
I spend my whole day stealin' chickens
Mama, from the rich folks yard

I got the blues so bad one time
It put my face in a permanent frown
You know, I'm feelin' so much better
I could cakewalk into town

I want to go on a picnic
In the country mama oh, and stay all day
I don't care but don't do nothing
Just while my time away

I got the blues, so bad one time
It put my face in a permanent frown
You know, I'm feelin' so much better
I could cakewalk into town
