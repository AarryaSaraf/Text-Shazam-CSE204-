// Baby //

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I'll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time and I was like

Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Oh for you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I gotta play it cool, cause I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
Cause I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around and I'm like

Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm 16, and I thought that you'd be mine
I used to tweet you and text you and call you and hit you on Facebook all the time
But but but now you're gone, so far long that I can't even find you
You know that feeling when you leave your love and it's right behind you
Can't believe that you did me wrong, we were on iChat all night long
Listening to our favourite song, she was wrong, I am gone
I thought I loved her, never but no one above her
Yes she was my lover, but now until another like

Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone
I'm gone

// Forever //

I think I found my girl if it's you then holla
I think I found my girl if it's you then holla
I think I found my girl if it's you then speak to me

Girl it's getting late
The sun's going down
And it's about time I shake my way across the town
But before I go I just wanna say that you stay on my mind each and every day

I think I'm starting to like the time that we spent
And when it's building inside
Then I can't pretend
No I don't want to fight it
I don't want to hide the way I feel so I guess it's time for me to say

That I got eyes for you baby
I want us to be together
And if you feel it too
Tell me no one will treat you better

Cause on nights like this
It's good to know that you've got someone by your side like this
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this
And then you say
Hope this will last forever

Don't know if it's love
It's too early to say
But if it's something like it, I just want it to remain
Don't know if you're the one that takes a little time
But in the meantime girl, you feeling just fine
Cause the way you look at me never seen that look before
And if it's a hint of what's to come then baby can I get some more
Not tryna be too forward but I think it's best for you to know

That I got eyes for you baby
I want us to be together, be together
And if you feel it too
Tell me no one will treat you better (baby no one will treat you better)

Cause on nights like this
It's good to know that you've got someone by your side like this
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this
And then you say
Hope this will last forever

I think I found my girl if it's you then holla
I think I found my girl if it's you then holla
I think I found my girl if it's you then speak to me
I think I found my girl if it's you then holla
I think I found my girl if it's you then holla
I think I found my girl if it's you then speak to me

I got eyes for you baby
I want us to be together
And if you feel it too
Tell me no one will treat you better

Cause on nights like this
It's good to know that you've got someone by your side like this
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this
And then you say
Hope this will last forever

I got eyes for you baby
I want us to be together, be together
And if you feel it too
Tell me no one will treat you better

Cause on nights like this
It's good to know that you've got someone by your side like this

Dreaming of Benz, and kissing Mercedes, living the life, the life is so crazy

Never been lazy, never been shady, lost a few friends, the monies still gravy
We the new stars, that's why they still hating, money up front, we never be waiting
Save some and invest some, just let my money be patient
It's a cold world we that we live in, diamonds all in my pendant
They wish Satan tellers was in it then they'd prey for me to be finished
Them haters gon' start tripping when you don't pay them no attention
And the obstacle I might face, I guarantee that I kill it

[Justin Bieber:]
Ooh I cannot be broken, I cannot be broken
Ooh I cannot be broken, I cannot be broken
They can't take what's mine
Someone like me is hard to find

Looking at the TV and I ran across your face
Oh, what a feeling
What's the odds of us being from the same place
What's the chance of us both having the same taste
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh whoa, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

Never known my eyes to be so red
Never had a night when I didn't toss and turn in my bed
And when we speak a word at the same time, are you in my head?
Ain't no coincidence, no whoa

I ran into you on the other side of the world today
It's one in a billion
Looking at the TV and I ran across your face
Oh, what a feeling
What's the odds of us being from the same place
What's the chance of us both having the same taste
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh whoa, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Poo Bear:]
One at a time, it feels so crazy then what am I?
I want your silhouette in my mind
Love's so angry but you're so kind
Oh I don't believe in accidents
I do believe in taking a guess in your innocence
We're meant to be together in every sense
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Justin Bieber:]
Oh, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh whoa, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

// Cold Water //

[Justin Bieber:]
Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own

And if you feel you're sinking
I will jump right over into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old
You shouldn't be fighting on your own

And if you feel you're sinking
I will jump right over into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

I won't let go (I won't let go, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

[MØ:]
Come on, come on
Save me from my rocking boat
I just want to stay afloat
I'm all alone
And I hope, I hope
Someone is gonna take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul
I need to know

[Justin Bieber & MØ:]
You won't let go (I won't let go, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
You won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

[Justin Bieber:]
I won't let go
I won't let go

// Come Home To Me //

Come home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Then home is way too far away

TV light of blue and white
I just can't fall asleep tonight
Move over to the space where you should be
Even after you seem so far
Over mountains and diamond stars
Everybody has their own way home

Come home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Then home is way too far away

All my life I've dreamed of love
Never thought it would hurt this much
Kiss goodbye await for your return
Oh whoa
So I'll be strong and hold onto
The picture and the thought of you
Getting all the love that you deserve

Come home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Then home is way too far away

If home is where you are
Home is way too far away

// Despacito (Remix) //

[Justin Bieber:]
Coming over in my direction
So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into Heaven, yeah
Oh, you are my sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savour every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made, love, how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear,
The only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long

[Luis Fonsi:]
Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso

[Daddy Yankee:]
Oh, yeah ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

[Justin Bieber:]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito

[Daddy Yankee:]
Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube

[Luis Fonsi (Daddy Yankee):]
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido

[Daddy Yankee:]
Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo
Yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bang-bang
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bang-bang
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

[Daddy Yankee & Justin Bieber:]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito

[Daddy Yankee:]
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

[Daddy Yankee & Justin Bieber:]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito

[Daddy Yankee:]
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
¡Oye!

[Justin Bieber:]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito

[Daddy Yankee:]
Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube

[Luis Fonsi (Daddy Yankee):]
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido

[Luis Fonsi:]
Despacito
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
I just wanna hear you screaming, "¡Ay, Bendito!"
I can move forever cuando esté contigo
¡Báilalo!

[Daddy Yankee, Luis Fonsi & Justin Bieber:]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito

[Luis Fonsi (Daddy Yankee):]
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)

[Daddy Yankee, Luis Fonsi & Justin Bieber:]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito

[Luis Fonsi:]

// Don't Go //

Don't go, don't-
Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't-
Don't go

My Mona Lisa, baby
My masterpiece, baby
When I'm in pieces, baby
You give me peace of mind
You tell me we'll be fine
You always get me right
When it's dark, you're my light

Baby, that's why I need you on the regular
And if it wasn't you, no, it would never work
Got me going out my way to show you what you're worth, don't go

(Don't go)

I put in the work to hear you say
(Don't go)
Misery missing your company
(Don't go)
See 'em pulling at you that way
(Don't go)
Ooh, if this is where you supposed to be
(Don't go)

I woke up in the city
I ain't see your face
Almost lost my mind medication
Five stars for participation
It's a COVID operation
Hope you hear this where you're stationed
I lost my Bonnie
By that time you already banged it
She armed and dangerous
That long hair got me tangled up
You are my Topanga
Stood your ground even when they aimed at us
Even through all of that pain
None of it was in vain
And I'm proud of who you become
I hope you feel the same

Frozen
Don't let me go
But let it go, please
We been so close
Don't go ghosting me
My vital OG
That's on the record
You made me better

I put in the work to hear you say
(Don't go)
Misery missing your company
(Don't go)
See 'em pulling at you that way
(Don't go)
Ooh, if this is where you supposed to be
(Don't go)

Peace and love
You talk about him like he's decent enough
See you moving, is he keeping up?
Don't know what you're doing, but you needing love
Needing love

How far can you get, girl?
You know I been in love with you since the beginning, girl
Talking out of tone to me, gotta be kidding, girl
Get you all alone with me, gotta be committed, girl

Girl, I need to see your face
Hit the gas to win the race
30 pounds of loaded bass
Move it, babe
I love the chase
Do your dirt
I keep the taste
Pop that shit
And make me wait
Shorty like that
On the up but
I might be late

I put in the work to hear you say
(Don't go)
Misery missing your company
(Don't go)
See 'em pulling at you that way
(Don't go)
Ooh, if this is where you supposed to be
(Don't go)
(Don't go)
(Don't go)
(Don't go)
(Don't go)

// Don't Go Far //

// Double Negative //

No sleep at all, runnin' a lie
Doing you wrong, proving you right each time
That's a (that's a), that's a double negative, oh
Showing up late, dragging along
Won't pick up the phone while I be gone
Can't deny it
It's a double negative
Oh, double negative

Another jet, another day in the sky
Fly in another direction from you
Wish I could FedEx my heart
And show up to your door
Signed, sealed, delivered
But I make you cry, let you down
More than likely from across town
Double shame on me
Double shame, oh

No sleep at all, runnin' a lie
Doing you wrong, proving you right each time
That's a (that's a), that's a double negative, oh
Showing up late, dragging along
Won't pick up the phone while I be gone
Can't deny it
It's a double negative
Oh, double negative

She's like, "He ain't got no boundaries
And he ain't got no patience"
She's like, "He never got nothing planned
So he'll never get anxious"
Look in your mind
Keep wondering if you're too high maintenance
Look in your mind
Keep wondering if I'm just too famous (uh)
Tryna shake the negative energy
I'm with the karma coming right back on me
In a moment I'm flying
Metaphorically, it seems like heaven

No sleep at all, runnin' a lie (runnin' a lie)
Doing you wrong, proving you right each time (guess time is up)
That's a (that's a), that's a double negative, oh
Showing up late, dragging along (dragging along)
Won't pick up the phone while I be gone
Can't deny it (I won't deny it)
It's a double negative (double negative)

Oh, yeah yeah
Oh... double negative (double negative)
Never miss the negativity
Oh no, no
Oh, whoa... yeah...

More than amazement, more than entertainment

Aw, yeah

It's hard when everybody out there
Just assumes we're still together
I just ran into your cousin
And had to tell her that we wasn't
Me and all my other exes talk
Why can't we?
Guess that's something you never really liked 'bout me
I gotta be careful when I text you
'Cause "LOL"s turn into "I miss you"s
Been told to keep it 100
I lost you and found myself wondering

How do I wake up in the morning? You're not right next to me

How could we throw it all away?

Maybe yes, next time, what if there's no next time?

// Hard 2 Face Reality //

[Justin Bieber:]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Don't be afraid to stand alone
Don't be afraid to stand outside your comfort zone
I know it's hard away from home
And it ain't easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talkin' to your significant other all night long

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

[Poo Bear:]
Should've been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time
Now you're standin' right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Try to protect your feelings
You read in between the lines
Hope your heart has started healing, oh

[Justin Bieber:]
Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

// Heartache //

What? Wait
But yesterday we were
I don't understand

We started out it was perfect, nothing but fun
And my heart was convinced to say that you're the one
And I thought it would last for the rest of our lives
Boy was I in for a big surprise
With no doubt looking round, thinking that I'm so cool
Same place, same time every day of my life, could we meet after school?
Finally if I didn't make her cry
She wouldn't be with another guy

Nothing can cure my headache
Cause I'm experiencing what they call heartbreak
It's gonna hurt worse as long as I stay here
I know but man just let me lay here
Cause this is something that I can't shake
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak
They say it's only just as worse as you make it
I know but man just let me lay here

Now I'm all tore up taking back when I was at your door
The first time when you said, "Forever I'll be yours"
Started walking, your hand in my hand, feelings got stronger
We made a promise
And whenever I leave, it feels like you're still with me
But it all came crashing down
Sitting in my room I got to get out of here
What am I to do when I look up and you're not there, whoa?

Nothing can cure my headache
Cause I'm experiencing what they call heartbreak
It's gonna hurt worse as long as I stay here
I know but man just let me lay here
Cause this is something that I can't shake
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak
They say it's only just as worse as you make it
I know but man just let me lay here

Say I'm too young for love
I got so much life to live ahead
But, if only this is love I could get over
I know I have to deal with the pain

Nothing can cure my headache
Cause I'm experiencing what they call heartbreak
It's gonna hurt worse as long as I stay here
I know but man just let me lay here
Cause this is something that I can't shake
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak
They say it's only just as worse as you make it
I know but man just let me lay here

// Hotline Bling (Remix) //

What do you mean it's not like that?
Oh, you're sorry?
Well, where are you now that I need you?
But girl, let me tell you something

I know you called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
Called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
I know when that hotline bling
I'm sure I'm not your only fling
I know when that hotline bling
I'm sure I'm not your only fling

Every time I leave the city you
Been hangin' out with him like I don't know
Stay away from places that we always go
Tellin' him that we don't even talk no more
Every time he leave the city, you
Try to run game on me like it's just us
But I seen you in a Snapchat on his tour bus
When you hit my line, it don't mean that much

I know you called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
Called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
I know when that hotline blings
Sure I'm not your only flame
I know when that hotline blings
Sure I'm not your only flame

Every time I leave the city you, you, you
Tell me where he like to shop when you're up under him
Said you're lyin' 'bout being with your girlfriends
When you take advantage of me bein' absent
Take advantage, yeah
And I really tried taking you serious baby, it's really your loss
You had the chance being the only girl livin' in my heart and cross
Wanted to hold you down for a while, keep you smiling, no matter the cost
Would I double cross?

We could be talking on my cell phone
Right now when you need my love
Lose the number to my cell phone
Cause you don't really care about my love
Call me on that hotline bling
If you wanna be with me
Call me on that hotline bling, right now
If you wanna be with me

// How To Love (Remix) //

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Now you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love

When you was just a young'un you're looks but so precious
But now you're grown up
So fly it's like a blessing but you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love

I just want to take my time
I just want to do my thing
Maybe we press rewind
Maybe I buy that ring
We could grow old together
Just share our soul together
Find out how to love, kiss and hug
How to roll together
I just need you by my side
Baby we could be alright
I just want to hold you right
We could go into the night
You're the one I need

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love

You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault
Wasn't in your intentions
You the one here talking to me
You don't want to listen
But I admire your popping bottles and dipping
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don't be mad
Nobody else tripping
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love

I just want you to know

// I Don't Care //

[Ed Sheeran:]
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Can you take my hand?
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" (Hell, yeah)
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that

Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say (Yeah)
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm

[Justin Bieber:]
We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Press your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm supposed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that

Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay

// I'll Be There //

Crying out for love, I'm just here to take you away (you away)
Don't worry 'bout a thing, I'm just focused on you today (on you today)

You're laid out
You were raised up in a poor town
Roll up, baby roll up
So hard to leave, but I know I gotta go now
Paris and London (on top of the world)
Baby there's something (will you be my girl?)
Something I wanna say
Yeah, you know I'll be there

I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close babe, close to my heart
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone
Holding you close babe, close to my heart

You sent me a picture, well I sent one too
I'm just tryna keep this love on track
Oh babe, I got your heart and I won't give it back

You're laid out

Holding you close babe, close to my heart

Holding you close to my heart
Uh, yeah, so I'm laid back in the Maybach
Damn these seats go way back

When we used to say that
I was yours, you were mine
And we fought to pass the time
And I realized, I realized, that I'll be
(There) no matter what
(There) no matter what
(There) no matter what (oh)

// Intentions (Acoustic) //

Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions

Shout-out to your mom and dad for makin' you
Standin' ovation, they did a great job raisin' you
When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a bae, you a beast
You make it easy to choose
You got a mean touch, I can't refuse (No, I can't refuse it)

Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention

Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions

Already passed, you don't need no approval
Good everywhere, don't worry 'bout no refusal
Second to none, you got the upper hand now
Don't need a sponsor, nope, you're the brand now
You're my rock, my Colorado
Get that ring, just like Toronto
Love you now, a little more tomorrow
This how I feel, act like you know that you are

Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions

Only intentions
That's all I plan to do

Face like a goddess, body on ten

That was back when you wasn't allowed to have friends
Now you grown up, features all swole up

Seen you at the club had me like "Hol' up"

[Lil Twist:]
We can intertwine, just let me get behind
And watch me run up in that thang like the finish line
To end it like it's Christmas time, I eat it like it's dinner time
She said let's do it like at 86, I said let's do it like 69
Give her a bit a this it ain't no way she getting tired
Introduced to the molly now she's amp'd and she's wired
Get her back to the room, she said "Twizzy is who I desire"
I said let's get in the shower girl that ass is on fire
I pay you with attention, direct deposit wire

That shit don't need even matter as long as love transpires
And after all that, baby you should really know me
Now you ain't got never be lonely

'Cause they say love will kill you, let me say my dying wishes
Ain't this world is so called riskers?
Girl it's your call to risk it
You called I had to pick up to make up for all my misses
But when we're together, you act like a different artist
So I painted this to show you I'm better at being heartless, you know

I asked her what's her name, got to know she said Hannah
On the way to the mansion, said she loved the Panamera
In the trap with J. Bieber with my phone chirpin' like beepers
Mona Lisa, Anna Mae is in the pot when I beat her
Take her 'cross the country, I got plugs on the Visa
Cut your man off little mama, you don't need him

[Takeoff:]
Yeen never seen a nigga like me
Hopping out, Giussepe steppin' with a mink, gold chain, Mr. T
In the summer, in a V12 Hummer with the leather seats
Would tell you 'bout my mansion but I think they watchin' me
I'm a vegetarian
All I want is some lettuce and some broccoli
Mansion out in Beverly
Yo bitch call me call me "Your Majesty"

[Offset:]
My bitch is so gorgeous, I might pay her mortgage
I run to the money like Forrest
My life is historic
Travel 'round the world like I'm in orbit
I take your bitch and dunk her like Ben Gordon
I watch her like a telescope
I beat it and kill it like I'm Lil TerRio
I got your bitch, she watchin' me like Tyler Perry shows
I'm young and I'm rich, ridin' in a Phantom Ghost
I paint a picture for niggas like Michelangelo

// Mama's Boy //

Walking on red dirt, no concrete pavement
Navy blue book bag on my back
Couple miles 'til I'm at the greyhound station
Hope they let me ride away with them
Got pretty mad at my father today
But I'm still thinking 'bout what my mother would say
As I'm singing an old song she used to sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to

I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do
But she'll be worried sick if I do if I do

Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't

So I turn around and headed to the old run-down building
Bells gonna ring before I make it back
I watch the upper-class men drive right past me
Wish they'd let me ride away with them
Still haven't got over it yet
It's been playing in my ears all morning I swear
My iPod's the same tune my mother would sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to

I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do
But she'll be worried sick if I do if I do

Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't

Never get mad enough to walkout
If I do then I won't be gone for long
Never fed up enough to leave her
No matter what I'll love her just the same
That's my mama, yeah
So no matter what I ain't leaving unless she's coming soon

Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't
