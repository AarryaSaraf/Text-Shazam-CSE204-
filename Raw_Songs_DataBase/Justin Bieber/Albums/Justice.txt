Album: Justice

// 2 Much //

[Martin Luther King Jr.:]
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere

[Justin Bieber:]
Maybe I stare too much
Maybe not long enough
Funny how I forget to blink
But when you let down your hair
Dancin' like no one's there
I know I'm where I'm supposed to be

Say, "I love you" under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up and I still ain't got no rest

Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months and that's too much

Love the way you love your mom
And take on all your friends' problems
Still somehow stop the world for us, oh
I still relive that second
I met my biggest blessin'
Prayed for you, look what God has done

Say, "I love you" under my breath
More times than you can digest
Music every time I hear your name, oh
Your head's layin' right on my chest
Sun's up and I still ain't got no rest

Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
When I can't feel you, I feel out of touch
Two seconds without you's like two months
Don't wanna close my eyes, I'm scared I'll miss too much
Don't wanna fall asleep, I'd rather fall in love
'Cause eternity with you ain't long enough
Two seconds without you's like two months and that's too much

// Deserve You //

When I'm in my thoughts sometimes
It's hard to believe I'm the person you think I am
The person that you tell me you love
I'm on my ten thousandth life
Nine thousand nine hundred nine and it slipped my hands
But this the one I'm not givin' up

Night after night you fall asleep on me
I'm prayin' that I don't go back to who I was

I feel like I don't deserve you tonight (Tonight)
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight (Tonight)
It's in the things that you show me (Show me)
I need you, don't let me go, need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de–, I don't de–, I don't deserve you tonight

I can tend to hold things back
I need you more than I let you believe I do
'Cause you could think it might be too much, oh, yeah
I don't wanna be my past
Oh, when we kiss, I'm alive and I feel brand new
There's nothing that I want more than us (Na-na-na-na-na)

Night after night, you fall asleep on me (Sleep on me)
I'm prayin' that I don't go back to who I was (Oh, no, no no, no)

I feel like I don't deserve you tonight (Deserve you)
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight (Deserve you)
It's in the things that you show me (Oh)
I need you, don't let me go (No), need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de–, I don't de–, I don't deserve you tonight

Somewhere in the sky (Yeah)
The way your body fits on mine
And when you give in to me, I'm so high, but I'm fallin' (Na-na-na)
And now my eyes are locked on you (Yeah)
As you dance around the room (Yeah)
And finally, I'm right where I belong (Oh)

I feel like I don't deserve you tonight (I don't deserve you)
It's in the way that you hold me
I don't deserve you tonight (I don't deserve you)
It's in the things that you show me (I can't live without you)
I need you, don't let me go (Hey), need you, don't let me go
I feel like I don't de–(I don't), I don't de–(I don't)
I don't deserve you tonight (You)

(I don't deserve you)
No, I don't, no
(I don't deserve you)
Girl, I need you, I can't breathe without you

// As I Am //

[Justin Bieber:]
By myself sometimes, to give my mind some space
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know that it hurts when I push your love away, I hate myself
I wanna tell you lies so your heart won't break
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know that I made my fair share of mistakes

Sometimes I don't know why you love me
Sometimes I don't know why you care
Take me with the good and the ugly
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"

Take me as I am, swear I'll do the best I can
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"
Take me as I am, swear I'll do the best I can
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"

[Khalid:]
A thousand miles apart, yeah, you're the one that holds my heart
It's no surprise, and I tell you all the time
And when life gets way too hard, I'll meet you in the stars, you know I will
I'll keep you near (Mmm), as I wipe away your tears (Mmm), yes

[Justin Bieber & Khalid:]
Sometimes I don't know why you love me
Sometimes I don't know why you care
Take me with the good and the ugly
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"

[Justin Bieber & Khalid (Justin Bieber) {Khalid}:]
Take me as I am, swear I'll do the best I can
(Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere") {Yeah}
(Take me as I am, swear I'll do the best I can)
Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"

[Justin Bieber (Khalid):]
You were there for me when I was actin' selfish
And you prayed for me when I was out of faith
You believed in me when ain't nobody else did
It's a miracle you didn't run away (Yeah)
(You were there for me when I was actin' selfish)
And you (prayed for me when I was out of faith)
You (believed in me when ain't nobody else did)
(It's a miracle you didn't run away)

[Justin Bieber (Khalid) {Both}:]
Sometimes I don't know why you love me
(Sometimes I don't know why you care)
Take me with the good and the ugly
{Say, "I'm not goin' anywhere"}

// Off My Face //

One touch and you got me stoned
Higher than I've ever known
You call the shots and I follow
Sunrise, but the night's still young
No words, but we speak in tongues
If you let me, I might say too much

Your touch blurred my vision
It's your world, and I'm just in it
Even sober, I'm not thinkin' straight

'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you
I'm out my head, so into you
And I don't know how you do it
But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh

Can't sleep 'cause I'm way too buzzed
Too late, now you're in my blood
I don't hate the way you keep me up

Your touch blurred my vision
It's your world, and I'm just in it
Even sober I'm not thinkin' straight

'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you
I'm out my head, so into you
And I don't know how you do it
But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

'Cause I'm off my face, in love with you
I'm out my head, so into you
And I don't know how you do it
But I'm forever ruined by you, ooh-ooh-ooh

By you, ooh-ooh-ooh

// Holy //

[Justin Bieber:]
I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Justin Bieber {Chance the Rapper}:]
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know {Chance the Rapper}

[Chance the Rapper:]
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us

[Justin Bieber:]
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy

// Unstable //

[The Kid LAROI:]
Uh-uh, uh-uh
Unstable

[Justin Bieber {The Kid LAROI}:]
Sometimes I think I overthink {Think I}
And I start to feel anxiety {Anxie—}
There were times I couldn't even breathe (Mmm)
But you never once abandoned me {No, you never, ooh}

I tried to {scare you, scare you away}
Showed you the {door, you adored me anyway}
When I was broken in pieces
You were my peace of mind, you were my peace of {mind}

[Justin Bieber:]
Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved
Yeah, you loved me when I was unstable
Never judged, never judged
Never judged me when I was unable
To love myself, to trust myself
Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved
Yeah, you loved me when I was unstable

[The Kid LAROI:]
White knuckles tryna hold my sanity (Hold my)
Not every wound is the kind that bleeds, uh, uh
Never know when my mind's gonna turn on me (Never know)
But you're the one I call for security (Oh, baby)
These memories have been toxic (Oh)
I tried to wean and get off it (Oh)
Through everything, you been my rock
I think you're the only thing I didn't get wrong
Oh, I know God was listening
Every night when I would pray
You're an angel watchin' over me (Oh)
All I need

[Justin Bieber {The Kid LAROI}:]
I tried to {scare you, scare you away}
Showed you the {door, you adored me anyway}
When I was broken in pieces
You were my peace of mind, you were my peace of mind

[Justin Bieber:]
Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved
Yeah, you loved me when I was unstable
Never judged, never judged
Never judged me when I was unable
To love myself, to trust myself
Yeah, you loved, yeah, you loved
Yeah, you loved me when I was unstable

// MLK Interlude //

[Martin Luther King Jr.:]
I say to you this morning, that if you have never found something so dear and so precious to you that you will die for it, then you aren't fit to live
You may be 38 years old as I happen to be
And one day some great opportunity stands before you
And calls upon you to stand up for some great principle
Some great issue, some great cause
And you refuse to do it because you are afraid
You refuse to do it because you want to live longer
You're afraid that you will lose your job
Or you're afraid that you will be criticized
Or that you will lose your popularity
Or you're afraid that somebody will stab you or shoot at you or bomb your house
And so you refuse to take the stand
Well you may go on and live until you are 90
But you're just as dead at 38 as you would be at 90
And the sensation of breathing in your life is but the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit
You died when you refused to stand up for right
You died when you refused to stand up for truth
You died when you refused to stand up for justice

// Die For You //

[Justin Bieber:]
Ba-ba-da, ba-da
Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-da, ba

She's a stranger to the night shift
The type of girl you only dream about
I was lost under the lights, yeah (Yeah)
An angel in the flames, she pulled me out

Next time that I g-g-g-g-get her
I'ma tell her in every kind of way (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah)

I would walk through burning fire
Even if your kiss could kill me
You know I would die for you
Yeah, I would die for you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pain and passion, my desire
You're the right now and what will be
You know I would die for you
The rest of my life for you
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

(Ba-ba-da, ba-da)
I would die for you (Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-da, ba)

[Dominic Fike:]
She's a danger to the mindset
Displaced and stretched it out in every way
Crossin' every line, yeah
T-T-Touch base until you find the chemistry
And I know this ain't rocket science
And I never leave the house
Without checkin' on you first
And begin to wonder

[Dominic Fike {Justin Bieber}:]
Next time that I g-g-g-g-get her
I'ma tell her in {every kind of way} (Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah)

[Justin Bieber:]
I would walk through burning fire
Even if your kiss could kill me
You know I would die for you
Yeah, I would die for you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pain and passion, my desire
You're the right now and what will be
You know I would die for you
The rest of my life for you
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

Oh, I would die, I would die, I would die
Oh, I would die, I would die, I would die

I would walk through burning fire
Even if your kiss could kill me
You know I would die for you (I would die for you)
Yeah, I would die for you (I would die for you, baby)
Pain and passion, my desire
You're the right now and what will be
You know I would die for you
The rest of my life for you
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

Yeah-yeah
Yeah
I would die for you

// Hold On //

You know you can call me if you need someone

Painting stars up on your ceiling
'Cause you wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
You know you can call me if you need someone

Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes (We all make mistakes)
Take my hand and hold on

'Cause I know how it feels to be someone (Someone)
Feels to be someone who loses their way

You're looking for answers in a place unknown
You need the connection but you can't get close (Can't get close)

// Somebody //

Every time I wake up next to you, I talk to God
And I'm so damn grateful 'cause you make up for the things I'm not
Didn't know I needed nothin' 'til I needed you ('Til I needed you)
In a world that's spinnin', it ain't easy lettin' go
Eight billion people, we just lookin' for a hand to hold
Everybody's tryna find someone to hold on to (Hold on to)

It's okay, it's okay
We all try to pretend that we're brave
When I'm weak, yeah, I'm strong
'Cause of you at the end of the day

Everybody needs somebody (Everybody needs somebody)
Somebody to remind you that you're not alone
Who gon' defend you like an army? (Gon' defend you like an army)
And never let go? (Never let go)
Yeah, everybody needs somebody (Everybody needs somebody)
Somebody to wake up to when everyone's gone
So if you need me, then you got me (If you need me, then you got me)
I'll be the shoulder you cry on

Everybody needs some–
Everybody needs somebody

Every time I look at you, I'm lookin' at a star
It's the way you light up every room just bein' who you are
Didn't know I needed nothin' 'til I needed you ('Til I needed you, ooh-woah)

But you stole my heart before anyone knew you had it

// Ghost //

Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know

That if I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (More than life)
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life

Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I need more time, but time can't be borrowed
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know

That if I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (Yeah)
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy (Oh)
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life

Woah-oh-oh-oh
Na-na-na
More than life (Oh)

So if I can't get close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life

// Love You Different //

[Justin Bieber:]
I will love you different
Just the way you are
And I will love you different

You pull up in a foreign
You that New York time, easy Sunday morning (Front seat)
When we touch, I think we skip a beat (Beep, beep, beep)
It's a movie with you, got me at the edge (Let me see)

There's beauty on your lips
I drown with every kiss, I'm not used to this
There's nothin' I won't give
Don't like makin' promises, just remember this

I will love you different
Just the way you are
And I will love you different
That's what you been lookin' for

You're the fruit of my life
That patient kind, that tongue got me tongue-tied
And that's why I will love you different
Just the way you are

No matter how different, you're beautiful
I can't make this up, no, baby, ain't no need to beat your face in
Fenty, want you on the cover, under covers ain't no rubbers
On this planet, I'll treat you like a mother, let's make babies

There's beauty on your lips
I drown with every kiss
I'm not used to this
There's nothin' I won't give
Don't like makin' promises

It's a different night with you right by my side
You mix the color, color, color, color, see the future bright

// Loved By You //

[Justin Bieber:]
I bought a castle in France and it's the same one
I built in the sand for you when I was two
I thought I painted a picture of Heaven
But it turns out it's just your room, just your room
I'd run off the end of the earth just to see if you'd catch me
When I know you'd let me fall every time

All I do is wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my (All I do)
Is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way (I need to be loved by you)
I wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my (All I do)
Is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way (I need to be loved by you)

[Justin Bieber {Burna Boy}:]
I need to be loved by you (Oh)
I need to be loved by you {Need to}
I need to be loved by you {Need to, need to, need to}
I need to be loved by you

[Burna Boy:]
I remember when we started datin'
The only ting that you and me was chasin'
The kinda lovin' that they couldn't play with
You know my lovin' is an every day ting, baby
You and me in different places
Textin' and messagin' and talkin' crazy
When I'm with you, I feel like it's a daydream
That's how I know that you would always be my baby

[Justin Bieber:]
All I do is wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my (All I do)
Is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way (I need to be loved by you)
I wish that I could change myself
I wish that I could change my (All I do)
Is wait around and hate myself
Oh, I hate the way (I need to be loved by you)

I walked a thousand miles (You), I've opened every door
It's not enough, it's still your love I'm always looking for
It's just the way I'm wired, whether I'm wrong or right
I've only got one thing on my mind

[Justin Bieber {Burna Boy}:]
I need to be loved by you
I need to be loved by you {Need to, need to, need to, need to}
I need to be loved by you (You)
I need to be loved by you {Need to, need to, need to, need to}
I need to be loved by you

// Anyone //

Dance with me under the diamonds
See me like breath in the cold
Sleep with me here in the silence
Come kiss me, silver and gold

You say that I won't lose you, but you can't predict the future
So just hold on like you will never let go
Yeah, if you ever move on without me
I need to make sure you know that

You are the only one I'll ever love (I gotta tell ya, gotta tell ya)

Forever's not enough time to (Oh)
Love you the way that I want (Love you the way that I want)
'Cause every mornin', I'll find you (Oh)
I fear the day that I don't

You say that I won't lose you, but you can't predict the future

Yeah, if you ever move on without me

// Lonely //

Everybody knows my name now
But something 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seeing somebody else

And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killing me now

What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fucking lonely

I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely

Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did
As an idiot kid

What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me

'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fucking lonely

I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely

// Red Eye //

Hoppin' on the red-eye
Hoppin' on the red-eye
I can rest assured knowing you're on the other end of it
Looking forward to the descent in your route
See you when I touch down

You're my champagne
You make me pop off everywhere like confetti (Yeah)
I know it seems strange
I seen you last night and I miss you already (Yeah, ayy)
My bed is depressed (Depressed)
My pillow's a victim (Hmm, hmm)
Got me in chills while my hands are sweaty (B-O-I)

And I gotta fly out (Ha)
Hate you got me strung-out (Ha)
And I gotta fly out (Hey)
Hate you got me strung-out, oh-ooh
Only been ten hours but my sanity is gone

Hoppin' on the red-eye (Ha)
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Big bag, oh, big-big)
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Hey, big bag, big-big)
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Big bag, oh)

Got a new job, for a big bag
You better go get it
You'll be gone for a few days, posin' in the heat
I ain't gon' sweat it
I miss your distractions
My touch is in distress
You're just a plane ride away from my permanent visit

And I gotta fly out (Ha)
Hate you got me strung-out (Ha)
And I gotta fly out (Ha)
Only been an hour but I'm feelin' all alone

You should be hoppin' on the red-eye (Right now)
Hoppin' on the red-eye (Right away)
I can rest assured knowing you're on the other end of it
Looking forward to the descent in your route (Ooh-woah, ooh-woah, oh)
See you when I touch down

(Hey)
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na, na-na, ah-ah (Oh)

// Hailey //

Had a dream, I was high
Holdin' on to the sky
But I heard your voice and stopped myself from fallin'
There'll be days, there'll be nights
When the stars don't align
And the sun can't even stop the rain from pourin'

So lay with me and let time just pass by
And don't let go (Don't let go)
'Cause all I know

This life is crazy
But it led me to your love
If you call on me forever I will come
No matter what, baby
The only thing I'm certain of
We'll be diamond when our golden days are done
No matter what (What), no matter what (What)
It's only us (It's only us)
Yeah, no matter what

Got you good, in the bag
Everything that I have
When the silence fills the air, just know I'm on it
When the waves start to crash
Like a fear from the past
Just remember that you're all I've ever wanted (Ever wanted)

So lay with me and let time just pass by
And don't let go (Don't let go)
'Cause all I know (Yeah)

This life is crazy
But it led me to your love
If you call on me forever I will come
No matter what, baby
The only thing I'm certain of
We'll be diamond when our golden days are done
No matter what (What), no matter what (What)
It's only us (It's only us)
Yeah (Yeah), no matter what

Lookin' in your eyes
Can't believe you're mine
It's beyond an obsession, all of my attention
Nothing can compare to you (To you)
What did I do right? (Do right)
To hold you every night (Every night)
It's beyond an obsession, all of my attention
Nothing can compare to you

This life is crazy
But it led me to your love
If you call on me forever I will come
No matter what, baby
The only thing I'm certain of
We'll be diamond when our golden days are done (Yeah, ayy)

This life is crazy

// Lifetime //

Oh, darling
There's not much that you can say
To stop me from falling in
Like I am
Oh, darling
Even waves can't wash away
Our names in the sand
Never could, never can

You are my everything
I'd give up everything
Show me the darkest parts of your heart, I ain't gonna run
Every dance is slow
Every kiss is woah
They say you know when you know, well I know
I know you're the one

Some people bring you a million blessings
Some people teach you a million lessons
All that I learned it wasn't my turn
It wasn't the right time
Some people come in your life for a reason
Others they come in your life for a season
But baby, you are a lifetime

Oh, darling
There's no word that can describe
The way that I feel, tonight
Oh, darling
I would walk that broken road
Time and time again
If it led me to your hello

You are my everything
I'd give up everything
Show me the darkest parts of your heart, I ain't gonna run
Every dance is slow
Every kiss is woah
They say you know when you know, well I know
I know you're the one

Some people bring you a million blessings
Some people teach you a million lessons
All that I learned it wasn't my turn
It wasn't the right time
Some people come in your life for a reason
Others they come in your life for a season
But baby, you are a lifetime
Baby, you are a lifetime
