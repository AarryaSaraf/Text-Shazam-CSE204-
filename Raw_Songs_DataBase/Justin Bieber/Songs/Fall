Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend, when she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

But did you know that I loved you? Or were you not aware?
Well you're the smile on my face and I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
But I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

Who's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't want to lose it either
But I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand

Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Well did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
Cause I know that a piece of you's gone every time he done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song I'll have figured out

Who's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
And if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself

Fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let you, let yourself fall, oh baby
