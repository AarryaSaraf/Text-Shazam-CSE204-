With you, with you
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place

Now, Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games 'til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go, and I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two (Who knew?)
Now we don't want to fall, but we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (Can do)
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve, tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher, I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
'Cause ain't no way it's going to end right but we are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't wanna let go, and I don't wanna let you know
There might be something real between us two (Who knew?)
Now we don't wanna fall, but we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (Can do)
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

You see, like, just because this cold, cruel world saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't want to be so old and grey, reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did, and everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah

I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (Nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space (And space)
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you

Yeah
