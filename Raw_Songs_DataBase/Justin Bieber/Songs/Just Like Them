I know it's hard but, you know
Let's go

There's something different in your eyes baby
You can't seem to look into mine lately
Tell me what is on your mind baby
Or I'm gon' assume that something's wrong

I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
'Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not really tripping, I just can't do this again
Please don't tell me you're just like them

Please don't tell me you're just like them
You're just like them

I know that it's hard to trust love
But you need the trust that my love
Will never leave you in the dust

I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
'Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not barely tripping I just can't do this again
Please don't tell me you're just like them

Please don't tell me you're just like them
You're just like them

Baby can we keep this love on track?
We can run away baby girl and we don't have to look back
You know that I love you girl so tell me what you're waiting for?
You gotta know know know know
Know know know know know know
Know know know know know know

I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
'Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not barely tripping I just can't do this again
Please don't tell me you're just like them

Please don't tell me you're just like them
You're just like them
