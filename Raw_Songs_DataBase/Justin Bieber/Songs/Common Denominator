Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over again, oh
You're the light that feeds the sun in my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl

Out of all the things in life
That I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, whoa

I don't want to go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Girl, without you I'm lost, can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love, you're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Before your love was low, playing girls was my high
You changed the game, now I put my card to the side, ay
When broken hearts rise up to say, "Love is a lie"
You and I would stand to be love's reply, yeah

Out of all things in life
That I could fear, yeah
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, here, here, yeah

I don't want to go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Girl, without you I'm lost, can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love, you're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I can't imagine life without your touch
And every kiss that you give, you fill me up
And through all the heart aching, jealous females hating
I'mma hold it down for you, you
Oh, whoa, oh, you're the common denominator
Oh, yeah, whoa, I don't want to go back

I don't want to go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Girl, without you I'm lost, can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love, you're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over again
