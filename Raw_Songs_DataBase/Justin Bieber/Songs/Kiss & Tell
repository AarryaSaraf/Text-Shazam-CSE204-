Yeah, JB, yeah, whoa, no no

Now I can see it girl, you ain't gotta say nothing
Your lips are calling me like they want to do something
I feel the chemistry, yeah you're into me
A little kiss is a definite possibility
Seen you a couple times, had a couple conversations
Since you've been on my mind, had a couple observations
Like you a fly chick, you could be my chick
Play by the rules and you can get what I give

Just keep it quiet, keep it on the hush
And what we do, keep it just between us
I don't want to see you tweet about JB 'cause
The only people that should know is you and me so

Baby, I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
You got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss
Kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss
Kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

It's confidential, no one has to do with it
But you and me girl, telling would ruin it
Don't need that TMZ all in our privacy
Use them lips for kissing girl if you want to ride with me
And if you want to tell somebody
Then we can call the whole thing off; no problem
You can go your way and I'll go mine
But I'd rather spend a little time with you, yeah

Just keep it quiet, keep it on the hush
And what we do, keep it just between us
I don't want to see you tweet about JB 'cause
The only people that should know is you and me so

Baby, I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
You got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss
Kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss
Kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Kiss and tell, oh
Don't tell your homies, don't tell your mama
Don't tell your girlfriends, that'll start some drama
Stay off that Facebook, I'll treat you real good
You keep this private and you can get what I give

Baby, I know that you're cool with rocking with me
But I can't have you telling everybody
You got me all twisted with your lips like this
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss
Kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss
Kiss and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

Kiss and tell, whoa oh, I'm not about that
If you're gonna kiss and tell, oh no no no
If you're gonna kiss and tell
If you're gonna kiss and tell, that's not me
