Uh, uh, you know it, babe
Uh, uh, you know it, babe

Could open up the door like a gentleman
Could you open up your heart and just let me in?
Tell me what you need and girl
I'll never ever disappoint you, whoa
And if you rock with me I could show you, babe
Ain't nobody gonna know you like I know you, babe
We could fly away, fly, fly away
I adore ya, whoa

Walking around with a little attitude
Short black skirt, the leather jacket too
How could I ever be mad at you?
And I don't know, yeah
But I know all about your secrets
'Cause you know that I can keep it
Baby no, can't you see that
I'm yours

I'm only yours, babe (All yours, all yours)
I'm only yours, baby yeah (All yours, all yours)
I'm only yours, babe (All yours, all yours)
I'm only yours, baby yeah (All yours, all yours), oh
