We were inseparable
Everything I had to do, I did it next to you
And the memories we made were so incredible
Then our love was interrupted by my schedule

There was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby, you got used to

Being alone, alone
You adapted, now you're used to
Being alone, all alone
Ooh you got used to being on your own

I saw it happening
But I didn't accept the truth, I couldn't fathom it
There was so much going on you couldn't handle it
Could have divided my time, I should have rationed it

There was nothing that I could do
Cause you fell into the deepest depression baby
And I hate to know I'm responsible
And your heart filled up with so much aggression baby, you got used to

Being alone, alone
You adapted, now you're used to
Being alone, all alone
Ooh you got used to being on your own
