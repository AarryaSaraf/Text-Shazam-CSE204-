When I look at you, yeah, I see forever
Yeah, I made mistakes, baby, I ain't know no better
And when we fell in love, you made me feel special
I want you right here in my arms forever, oh-oh-oh

I can see us vibin' for the rest of our days (Uh-huh)
Jumpin' over hurdles that try to get in our way (We do)
And they can say what they wanna say
Baby, we can go all the way
Just take my hand and follow me, yeah
I want you and only you, yes, I do
I wanna kick it like kung fu, wanna see what the drums do (Dun-dun-dun-dun, dun)
And you know I could tell no lies and that's on God
'Cause you're the one that I run to
Mic check, one-two, one-two
No one competes, you're all I need
Big flash, say, "Cheese"
Vacay in Paris
You're my baby boo like a ghost
When the tide rides, we gon' flow
Yeah, they try to stop us like no, like no, oh, no

When I look at you, yeah, I see forever
Yeah, I made mistakes, baby, I ain't know no better
And when we fell in love, you made me feel special
I want you right here in my arms forever, oh-oh-oh

Right here, right here (Oh-oh-oh)
Right here, let's go

I want her right here in my arms
She really like me 'cause my charm
She like, "I didn't know you sing like that," I don't
I'm just givin' out flavor (Uh-huh), let's order a charter (Let's order a jet)
Won't go to the airport, let's fly to Jamaica (Like yoom)
I know that your friends wanna come with you, you can take 'em (Come on)
'Cause I'm not a bad sport (Let's go), you gon' need a passport
Me and you are a team
I'll be your bestie
Just promise you gon' love me and protect me
And I know you got everybody on your neck
And you curved 'em all to the left, everybody, except me

When I look at you, yeah, I see forever (Yeah, when I look at you)
Yeah, I made mistakes, baby, I ain't know no better (Know, oh-oh-oh-oh)
And when we fell in love, you made me feel special
I want you right here in my arms forever, oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh (Ha)
