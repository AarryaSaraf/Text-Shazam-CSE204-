Oh oh ohh-oh-oh, oh oh ohh-oh-oh
Oh oh ohh-oh-oh, and I pray

I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
It's in the papers, it's on the TV, it's everywhere that I go
Children are crying, soldiers are dying, some people don't have a home

But I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Hey, can you tell me how I can make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray

I lose my appetite (Can't eat, can't eat)
Knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner, 'cause of my dinner, still there on my plate?
Ooh I got a vision, to make a difference, and it's starting today

'Cause I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Heaven, tell me I can make a change

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray (And I pray)
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and

I pray for the brokenhearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
I pray for all the souls in need, I pray
Can you give 'em one today?

I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell me how to make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and

I pray
I pray
I pray
I close my eyes and pray
