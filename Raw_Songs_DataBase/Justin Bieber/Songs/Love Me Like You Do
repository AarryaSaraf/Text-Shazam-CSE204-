Love me like you do, love me like you do
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go
What am I to do when you love me like you do?
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go

Baby, baby, baby, teach me, teach me, teach me
Show me, show me, show me the way to your heart
Ooh, my baby, baby, I'm begging, lady, lady
Put me in the middle, that's where I'mma start, uh huh

I like how your eyes complementing your hair
The way that them jeans fit is making me stare
Promise, I'll be here forever, I swear
Our bodies touching while you

Love me like you do, love me like you do
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go
What am I to do when you love me like you do?
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go

Baby, baby, baby, will let me, let me, let me
Let me, let me, let me, be all you your desire
Pretty baby, baby, I'm begging lady, lady
Take me to the top now and I'll take you higher

I like how your eyes complementing your hair
The way that them jeans fit is making me stare
Promise, I'll be here forever, I swear
Kissing on your neck while you

Love me like you do, love me like you do
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go
What am I to do when you love me like you do?
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go

Alright, okay
Right there, my way
'Cause when you love me, I can feel it
When your heart beats, I can hear it
Be quiet, don't say a word
Don't say nothing, girl, I'm all yours
Love me like you do but let me go first
Listen to these words right here

Love me like you do, love me like it's new
Love me like you love me, like there's nothing left to lose
We'll hop up in the Benz, if you're tryna cruise
Hop up in them bed, baby, if you're trying to snooze
Louis V. shoes, look at me do it
Got a lot of secrets, baby, can you guess clues?
And if you had a choice I know what'd you choose
You'd choose me, right?

Love me like you do, love me like you do
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go
What am I to do when you love me like you do?
Like you do, hold me tight and don't let go
