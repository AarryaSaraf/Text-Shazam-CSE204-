Had a dream, I was high
Holdin' on to the sky
But I heard your voice and stopped myself from fallin'
There'll be days, there'll be nights
When the stars don't align
And the sun can't even stop the rain from pourin'

So lay with me and let time just pass by
And don't let go (Don't let go)
'Cause all I know

This life is crazy
But it led me to your love
If you call on me forever I will come
No matter what, baby
The only thing I'm certain of
We'll be diamond when our golden days are done
No matter what (What), no matter what (What)
It's only us (It's only us)
Yeah, no matter what

Got you good, in the bag
Everything that I have
When the silence fills the air, just know I'm on it
When the waves start to crash
Like a fear from the past
Just remember that you're all I've ever wanted (Ever wanted)

So lay with me and let time just pass by
And don't let go (Don't let go)
'Cause all I know (Yeah)

This life is crazy
But it led me to your love
If you call on me forever I will come
No matter what, baby
The only thing I'm certain of
We'll be diamond when our golden days are done
No matter what (What), no matter what (What)
It's only us (It's only us)
Yeah (Yeah), no matter what

Lookin' in your eyes
Can't believe you're mine
It's beyond an obsession, all of my attention
Nothing can compare to you (To you)
What did I do right? (Do right)
To hold you every night (Every night)
It's beyond an obsession, all of my attention
Nothing can compare to you

This life is crazy
But it led me to your love
If you call on me forever I will come
No matter what, baby
The only thing I'm certain of
We'll be diamond when our golden days are done (Yeah, ayy)

This life is crazy
But it led me to your love
If you call on me forever I will come
No matter what, baby
The only thing I'm certain of
We'll be diamond when our golden days are done
No matter what, no matter what (Yeah, yeah)
It's only us (It's only us)
Yeah, no matter what
