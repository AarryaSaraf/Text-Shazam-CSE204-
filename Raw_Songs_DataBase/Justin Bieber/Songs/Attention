Ayy

Lately, I've been losin' my mind
Certain things I can't find
In the middle of the night
I'm still up, I'm still tryna decide

Should I drink up? Smoke up?
I need some freedom, freedom, ah, in my life
Should I drink up? Smoke up?
I need some freedom, freedom

Show me a little attention
A little attention
Show me attention
Show me a little attention, yeah
Show me a little attention

Little love and some affection on the side
Little trust and some passion would be nice
It's all I desire
I need it, I cannot deny
Oh, ayy, I don't see something
For my eyes only
Ain't no emoji, cry him only, ah
Ain't no emoji, my mind's lonely

Show me a little attention
A little atten'
Show me atten'
Show me a little attention, no
Show me a little attention

Lately, I've been losin' my mind
Certain things I can't find
In the middle of the night
I'm still up, I'm still tryna decide

Should I drink up? Smoke up?
I need some freedom, freedom, ah, in my life
Should I drink up? Smoke up?
I need some freedom, freedom

Show me a little attention
A little atten'
Show me atten'
Show me a little attention, yeah
Show me a little attention
