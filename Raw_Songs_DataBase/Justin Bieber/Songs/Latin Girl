Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah-yeah
She's my Latin girl, she's my Latin girl

I was on the beach yeah, I was on vacation
I was doing nothing, I was just sitting patient
Then you walked by, you caught my eye
I said "Who's this girl? She's looking super fly"

Hey miss beautiful, I've never seen you before
And I would like to be the one to show you I am cool enough
Hey little momma, what you got on ya?
Looking so good that I just want to telephone her

She's my Latin girl
Ooo, pretty lady, don't you think it's crazy?
She's my Latin girl
Oh, she tries to fight it but she knows she likes it
She's my Latin girl
Saw what I see, then she's looking at me
She's my Latin girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah
