This is the time a year we can give it, give it, give it, give it all
One through ten on your list you can get it, get it, get it, get it now
Make your wish tonight when you open your eyes
When the lights go bright, girl, I'll be right there


Baby, you deserve everything you want, it's your night, oh
Wanna put my ear to your chest, girl

Baby, I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby, it sings to me, like fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Baby, I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby, it sings to me, like now I know that it's Christmas time


You got on my favourite dress
You're looking, looking, looking good
Snow fallin' on your hair, and I don't, I don't wanna get it off
Even the stars in the sky can't outshine your eyes
I wanna be your biggest gift, whoa


Baby, you deserve everything you want
It's your night, oh
Wanna put my ear to your chest now

Baby, I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby, it sings to me, like fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Baby, I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby, it sings to me like, now I know that it's Christmas time

I'll deck your heart with boughs of holly (Boughs of holly)
Fa la la la la la la, fa la la la la la la
Baby, 'cause you're the reason to be, jolly (You're the reason)
Fa la la la la la la, la la la la la la la (Baby girl)

I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby, it sings to me, like fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Baby, I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby, it sings to me like
Now I know that it's Christmas time

Yeah yeah, oh, whoa, whoa
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la, like Christmas
I know that it's Christmas time
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Know that it's Christmas time, yeah yeah (Fa la la la la)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ah, yeah
