Hey blue baby
Put that Hank Williams on
It's your little blue baby
Calling for her favorite song
Get out that whiskey
Pour it right quickly
Put them hallway lights on
I hope one day you can remember
Our love before it all went wrong

But the only stars we saw were in the sky
Not the boulevard
And the only thing we wanted was to be free
And the only girl you had eyes for played downtown
At the local bar
That was me
She was me

Hey blue baby
Get that old pickup going
Turn it once, twice, three times
If you love me, oh
Get out that dirt bike
Get on that turnpike
Do what you have to do
Just know your baby's back here waiting
Just know she thinks you're really cool

And the only stars we saw were in the sky
Not the boulevard
And the only thing we need is to be free
And the only girl you have eyes for plays downtown
At the local bar
That was me
She was me

I tell you all the time, get yourself in line
Tired of waiting, tired of crying
I tell you all the time, get yourself in line
Tired of yelling, tired of hollering
You're making me blue, you're making me blue
Making me blue, just do what you do

And the only stars we need were in the sky
Not the boulevard
And the only thing we want is to be free
And the only girl that you love still
Plays downtown at the local bar
Yeah she's me
Yeah she's me
