All the roses are red and Jupiter, too
I'm lying in my nightgown making confessions to you
It's all over now, baby blue
All my secrets are out
I told them all to you

And it's a little grim
But I sing a hymn only for you
I seal it with a kiss
And it goes like this
"Baby, love me too"

If I die young, let me die in California
And when I'm gone, let 'em play my favorite song
It's Jimmy Buffet
To remember life's a beach, baby, enjoy it
When I'm done, let the music play on
And on and on and on
Go on and on and on

All my stories are out
All the lies are out, too
When we drive in the nighttime
I lift them up to you

And it's a little grim
But I sing a hymn only for you
I seal it with a kiss
And it goes like this
"Baby, love me, too"

If I die young, let me die in California
And when I'm gone, make 'em play my favorite song
It's Jimmy Buffet
To remember life's a beach, baby, enjoy it
When I'm done, let the music play on
And on and on and on
Go on and on and on

Be my baby (Ohh)
Be my baby, tonight
We'll go on and on and on
Be my baby (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Be my baby, tonight
Go on and on and on

It's a little grim
But I sing a hymn only for you
I seal it with a kiss
And it goes like this

We'll go on and on and on
Be my baby (Mmm)
Be my baby, tonight
Go on and on and on
