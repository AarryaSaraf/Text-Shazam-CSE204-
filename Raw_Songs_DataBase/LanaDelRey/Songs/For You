All these feelings I'm tired of them
Ruling over my life again
Emotions aren't my friend
I keep them ordered as best I can

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Layman, workman, his man, her man
How about about the weather?

All these people I'm tired of them
Sifting into my life again
Their questions, the "how and when"
I try and answer the best that I can but

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Layman, workman, his man, her man
How about about the weather?

All my worries, they come and go
They tend to leave when I let you know
On bad days I take it slow
I try to dance when I hit a low

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
It will all get better

Oh, the days they go so fast
I can't believe what is in my past
The future's here at last
I don't need to have what she has

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
It will all get better

Sing it out, sing it loud
Sing it out, sing it loud
Be proud, come out
Be proud, come out

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
We can make it better, yeah
We will have it better
