Can't be bitter when I talk about him, Mike
I should have known better but I left without him and I
I used to dance for him, dance for him
I used to dance every Saturday night
I used to shake it for him, shake it for him
I want to stay but there's something ain't right

I'm wild, I'm free
No man can handle me
I write, I sing
Freedom's my love, God is my king
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one

I ain't no sinner, but sometimes I wonder why?
It's the middle of winter but in my mind it's summer, Mike
Used to move for you, move for you
Was a pleasure and the pleasure was mine

I'm wild, I'm free
No man can handle me
I write and I sing
Freedom's my love, God is my king
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one

God bless America
God bless the world at large
Guide these two wheels of ours
Right to the stripes and stars

I'm wild, I'm free
No man can handle me
I write and I sing
Freedom's my love, God is my king

I'm wild, I'm free
No man can handle me
I write and I sing
Freedom's my love, God is my king

I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
