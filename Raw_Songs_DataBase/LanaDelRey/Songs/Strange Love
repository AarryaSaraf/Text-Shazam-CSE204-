Hey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you're dreaming of?
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine?
What makes you fall in love?

It's strange the way we met
A desert road and then
My car had stopped and you pulled off
On your black motorcycle
You rode me to the bar
We danced all night under
The Christmas lights and the dark black night
With the lightning and the thunder

Hey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you're dreaming of?
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine?
What makes you fall in love?

You took me to the edge
Of town, that's where you slept
You liked it best when no one else
Could find you or could bother
You poured us mint juleps
And kissed me the lips
You held me tight in the TV light
And you said you never loved her

You have a dark heart, like mine
Things that you've seen in dark time
Let me love you, let me touch you
Let me show you you'll be fine

Hey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you're dreaming of?
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine?
What makes you fall in love?
