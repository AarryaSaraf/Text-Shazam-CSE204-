Hollywood and New York, mister major
Then there's me, little queen of the stage, yeah
He's a god, one the stars call creator
Hail the king of the industry players

Take off your business suit
Sitting in your lap for my interview

Hit it and run
Let's hit it and run
Hit it and run the world
Hit it and run
Baby, hit it and run
Hit it and run the world

Pick me up in your white Lamborghini
London town, you'll watch out while I'm singing
Glamorous on the stage, boy, believe me
Keep your girl back, no competing

Eyeing you from across the room
Watching me, wa-watching you

Hit it and run
Let's hit it and run
Hit it and run the world
Hit it and run
Baby, hit it and run
Hit it and run the world

You and me on a spree taking over
L. Del Rey (yay) wanna be your soldier
Hit it and run
Baby, hit it and run
Hit it and run the world

Oh oh
Oh oh
You know this world is mean
Nothing's for free
It's money and technology
Together we'd be deadly
You know this world is mean
Nothing's for free
It's money and technology
Together we'd be deadly, deadly, deadly

Hit it and run
Let's hit it and run
Hit it and run the world
Hit it and run
Baby, hit it and run
Hit it and run the world

You and me on a spree taking over
L. Del Rey (yay) wanna be your soldier
Hit it and run
Baby, hit it and run
Hit it and run the world
