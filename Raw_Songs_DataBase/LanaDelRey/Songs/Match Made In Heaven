(Sing that shit, girl)

It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

I'm not a trick but I'm a trick for you
I'm the girl next door, doing what you wanna do
What I'll never do, I really fell for you
You give me butterflies, heart skipping one, two

I, I, I, gotta get it started
I want it bad, bad, I want it bad

I know you're sick, boy, I wanna get the flu
I'm running temperatures thinking of your love, boo
Dizzy spells, ooh, is your love true?
I'm under influence, getting hot and chills too

I, I, I, gotta get it started
I want it bad, bad, I want it bad

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

You're such a bad boy, I heard about you
And so has every other girl, that's why they want you
My local rock star, the Willie B. crew
You out there on the grind
Now come home to your queen, boo

I, I, I, gotta get it started
I want it bad, bad, I want it bad

You're number one, boy, no one else will do
I'm like a prize fighter, clocking chicks to get to you
This race I run for you, won't stop until I'm through
I'm out there doing shit that I should never ever do

I, I, I, gotta get it started
I want it bad, bad, I want it bad

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Down on your knees, begging me, please
I am your queen, oh-ah

Don't wanna trip but I could fall for you
Heaven is a place called earth on your arm, ooh

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em
