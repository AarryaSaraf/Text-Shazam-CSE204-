You should have let me know
That I had no chance at all
I can never be what you wanted
Should have let me know
That you're still thinking about her
Should've told me you was on it

Sometimes I wonder why
Why I even bother
Trying to pull you out, boy
Should have let me know
I would lose you to the drink

Lift your eyes, lift your eyes
Just a little higher, just a little higher
Lift those eyes, look into mine
Cause I can guide ya, I can guide ya
Lift those eyes, lift your eyes
I know that you're scared to death
Running out of breath
But I can hold you, hold you

You should have let me know
That you worked around the clock
Could have tried a little harder, yeah
You should have let me know
That you were afraid to love me
Afraid of looking like a liar

Sometimes I wonder why
Why I even ask you, but I do

Lift your eyes, lift your eyes
Just a little higher, just a little higher
Lift those eyes, look into mine
Cause I can guide you, I can guide you
Lift those eyes, lift your eyes
I know that you're scared to death
Running out of breath
But I can hold you, hold you
