It's never too late, to be who you wanna be
To say what you wanna say
And it's never too late, to leave if you wanna leave
Or stay if you wanna stay, baby

I got a feeling in my bones
Can't get you out of my veins
You can't escape my affection
Wrap you up in my daisy chains

Hip hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover love, babe, mhm
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, mhm

It's never too late, to see what I wanna see
Instead of what's in front of me, yeah
And it's never too late, to be free if you wanna be
I can help you if you wanna be, babe

'Cause I got a feeling in my bones
Guess I got love on the brain
Giving into your affliction
Wrap you up in my daisy chains

Hip hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover love, babe, mhm
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, mhm

High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Don't be a bummer
Don't be a bummer

'Cause I got a feeling in my bones
Guess I got love on the brain
Giving into your affliction
Wrap you up in my daisy chains

Hip hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover love, babe, mhm
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, mhm
