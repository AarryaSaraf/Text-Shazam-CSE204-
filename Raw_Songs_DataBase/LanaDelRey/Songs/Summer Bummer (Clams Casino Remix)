It's never too late to be who you wanna be
To say what you wanna say
It's never too late to leave if you wanna leave
Or to stay if you wanna stay
But, baby, I got a feeling in my bones
Can't get you out of my veins
You can't escape my affection
Wrap you up in my daisy chains

Hip-hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm

Uh, her sophistication make you wanna quit the bitch you dating
Let's skip the games, let's quit the playing
Boo, let's get acquainted (what?)
Notifications sync in place even when we're on vacation (yeah)
I knew she'd notice like I missed the payment, dang it (Ooh)
But bang it like my fingers (What?)
She pray to God I made it (What?)
But banking like my Franklins (Yeah)
My neighbors stopped the hating (Yeah)
What? (what? They been at it, check it out)
Huh? (We been out here, yeah)
Slide inside it (What?)
Diddy Bopping (What?)
Milly Rocking (What? What?)
She just might become my lover for real
I might fuck with her all summer for real
They better not holler if I cuff her for real
Niggas better run for cover for real
Going bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal
Take the whip, two pills on the lips on the real
Truthfully, between you and me, I'm usually single
When it's hot outside this, I ride through any hood with the top out
Hop out

High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe

White lies and black beaches, miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like making me crazy
Tell me, "Have patience"
Baby, I need this, white lines and black beaches
White lies and black beaches and blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks, just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons in making me crazy
But you've got your reason, white lies and black beaches

High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Don't be a bummer
Don't be a
