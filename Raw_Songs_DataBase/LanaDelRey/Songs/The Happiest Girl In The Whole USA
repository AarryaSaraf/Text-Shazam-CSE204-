Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skip-a-dee-doo-dah day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A

Good morning, morning, hello sunshine
Wake up sleepy head
Why'd we move on that bojangle clock
So far away from the bed?

Just one more minute, that's why we moved it
One more hug or two
Do you love waking up next to me
As much as I love waking up next to you?

Well you make the coffee and I'll make the bed
I'll fix your lunch and you'll fix mine
Now tell me the truth, do these old shoes look funny?
Honey, it's almost nine

Now you be careful, gotta go
I love you, have a beautiful day
And kiss the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A

Skip-a-dee-doo-dah
Thank you Lord for making him for me
And thank you for making life turn out
The way I always thought it should be

There once was a time when I could not imagine
How it would feel to say
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A

Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skip-a-dee-doo-dah day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A
