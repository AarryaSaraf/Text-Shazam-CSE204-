You wanna lead me on?
Oh, well I'll show you
Come on girls, march it out
Show him what you're all about
Whooping, burn the house down, show him who's the leader
Bring ya baby down, down
Go cheerleaders!

Baby, I'm a gangster too and it takes two to tango
You don't wanna dance with me, dance with me
Honey, I'm in love with you, if you don't feel the same
Boy, you don't wanna mess with me, mess with me

Why, cause I'm a jealous, jealous, jealous girl
If I can't have you baby, if I can't have you baby
Jealous, jealous, jealous girl
If I can't have you baby, no one else in this world can
(Bring ya baby down down, go cheerleader!)

You say you got your own life, good for you
You got more important things to do
Come on girls, say it loud, tell him that it's over now
Whoop! You're not off the hook, ya deceiver
I know what you done, done, sing cheerleader

Baby, I'm a gangster too and it takes two to tango
You don't wanna dance with me, dance with me
Honey, I'm in love with you, if you don't feel the same
Boy, you don't wanna mess with me, mess with me

Why, cause I'm a jealous, jealous, jealous girl
If I can't have you baby, if I can't have you baby
