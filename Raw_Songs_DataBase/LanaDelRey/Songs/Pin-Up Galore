Pin up girls at the roller derby
Take me down to Newark, New Jersey
American flags
Blue, blue streamers
Everybody's laughing
The crowd is cheering

Baby, I've become someone
Baby, I've become
Baby, I've become someone
Not of this world
Not of this world

Dance at night back in Alabama
Christmas lights on my teal-green trailer
American flags
Blue, blue streamers
All the men are watching
The crowd is screaming

Baby, I've become someone
Baby, I've become
Baby, I've become someone
Not of this world
Not of this world

Prizes, prizes
A diamond tiara
Here's to the girl with the blue mascara
I have a disco ball mind
Lights flashing all of the time
I have a disco ball mind
I wanna die, I wanna die
I wanna die, I wanna die

Ooh, ooh

Baby, I've become someone
Baby, I've become
Baby, I've become someone
Not of this world
Not of this world
