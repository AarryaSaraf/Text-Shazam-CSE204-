They all know my name now
It's just another lonely day on the playground
Okay, let's go, 1, 2, 3, 4

No I'm not vintage, no I don't care
No I'm not Kylie, no, you can't compare me to another one
There's no one else, I'm nobody, I'm just myself
It's not Fight Club, I'm a rare snowflake
But if I hear you bringing me down, calling me so fake
I will fight you (yes), I will fight you (yes)
Because in the end, there's only truth and God is gonna smite you
Besides that, I don't like you

I just wanna party boy, I don't wanna fight
But everybody knows that that's the way it is
Only players can survive

They all know my name now
It's just another lonely day on the playground
(Only players can survive)
Rain, rain go away, now
Come again another day in the game now
(Only players can survive)

No I'm not retro, no I'm not fair
And yes, I like to re-record and dance in underwear
And it's not Scarface 'cause I'mma live forever
And if I hear from anyone you're trying to get too clever
Then I will fight you, I will win, I will rise again, soar in the wind
It's my destiny, the way my life begins
So if you're in my way, I'll knock you down like kingpin

I just wanna party boy, I don't wanna fight
But everybody knows that that's the way it is
Only players can survive

They all know my name now
It's just another lonely day on the playground
(Only players can survive)
Rain, rain go away, now
Come again another day in the game now
(Only players can survive)

Ring around the rosie, oh
I don't wanna fall down
Keep my feet on the ground
Pocket full of nursery rhymes
I'm just biding my time
Biding my lines

I'm wearing the invisible crown
You can't see it yet
Touring up and tearing the town, a soul sinner, yes
Sometimes I rap too
I'm a white girl, but the world is my oyster
I'm a little pearl, yep

They all know my name now
It's just another lonely day on the playground
(Only players can survive)
Rain, rain go away, now
Come again another day in the game now
(Only players can survive)

Ring around the rosie, oh
I don't wanna fall down
Keep my feet on the ground
Pocket full of nursery rhymes
I'm just biding my time
Biding my lines
