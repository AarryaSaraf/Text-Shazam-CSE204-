I'm doing alright, most of the time
In fact, yesterday, I was even doing real well and I
Think that I might claim you as mine
So that my head can rest and everybody can tell, and I

Had a strange dream and I
Called you at night and I
Had to make known that I wasn't alright
And say that I had you on my mind
Had you on my mind

I make it a point to rest through my day
To close my eyes and visualize my troubles away and I
Think of you here and I close my eyes tight
Somehow the vision of you near makes me feel alright and I

Had a strange dream and I
Called you at night and I
Had to make known that I wasn't alright
And say that I had you on my mind
Had you on my mind

Had you on my mind
Had you on my mind
Had you on my mind
