Every time that you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
He's someone I have never talked about
'Cause I know that we'd both be dead if you found out

Every time you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something I have been withholding
I'm not like every other girl

Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for

So if you begin to think
That my light might be supernatural
I'd have to say "You're right, you're right, mon cher, it is"
I come from a place that your mind cannot even imagine
Where we sing "Maha, maha, maha, maha"

Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for

Maha, oh Maha
Oh Maha, Maha
I give my loving, I'm your devoted
I'll give my love, babe
I'm your devoted

Maha, Maha, Maha, Maha
Maha, Maha, Maha
