If it was the New York Times, they'll say that I'm dead
And if it's Rolling Stone, they'll say I'm uninviting
I don't really give a fuck, it's no surprise
I never had friends here either
Still I'm on a run with the light in my eyes
And if you did it wouldn't happen either

Sometimes bad things happen to good people
And sometimes angels touch pure evil
That don't mean they stop
They can fight for what's right and I will
'Cause I don't have the time to kill
And I, I don't have the will

If you see the light in my eyes, know I'm shining
I walk my road alone 'til here, so I'll keep writing
I don't need your love, I've been this far down
Back into the New York City
I've been sober for eleven years right now
If that don't mean a thing, well, I try

Sometimes bad things happen to good people
And sometimes angels touch pure evil
And I won't stop, I won't fight
I'll just stray towards the light
'Cause I know sometimes bad things happen to good people
And that's mine

Jesus, walk with me
I don't have anything I can offer up to you
But Jesus can comfort me
I don't really wanna drink, some pot will do
Heaven is on Earth
I have peace and that's more than you
I can live in the light like a maniac
In the stars attack, in the zodiac

So ride for the first time and die for the last time
I'm with the angels and I'm stressed in the back row
Keeping me harder, I try and I start
But I'm scared I won't catch up and it don't matter

Sometimes bad things happen to good people
And sometimes angels touch pure evil
And I will fight for the right
To keep on making art out of my life
Fight for the right to be different
In a world full of fake bitches
