Ah, don't fuck with me
I told you (told you)
I told you (told you)
(You thought you knew everything of me, who do you think I am?)
I told you (told you)

Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
I told you (told you)
Don't fuck with me
I told you (told you)
Don't fuck with me (told you)
I told you (told you)
Don't fuck with me (I told you)
Don't fuck with me (I told you)

Fuck-you attitude
You know what I wanna do
Light it up red, white and blue
Do I look high to you?
That's because I am
That's because I am
Do you know what I had to do
To get here, man!?

No no, you don't don't
'Cause you're not a gangster (Don't fuck with me)
(Scarface)
No no, you don't don't (Don't fuck with me)
'Cause you're not a gangster
Like I am

Scarface, sacrifice
Sold my soul to make it nice
It was worth it, paid the price
Life is death when blow is life
But me and my crew
We know what we like
We know how to roll
Will we ever stop? No!

Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
You're not a gangster
Don't fuck with me (You're not a gangster)
Don't fuck with me (You're not a gangster)
Don't fuck with me (You're not a gangster)
Don't fuck with me (You're not a gangster)
Don't fuck with me (You're not a gangster)
Like I am

Don't fuck with me (Oh)
Don't fuck with me (Oh)
(Oh)
Don't fuck with me (Oh)
Don't fuck with me (Oh)
Don't fuck with me!

Yes, yes, yes
Don't fuck with me
(Ah)

Don't fuck with me (You're not a gangster)
(Fuck you)
You're not a gangster
You're not a gangster
You're not a gangster
You're not a gangster
Fuck!
