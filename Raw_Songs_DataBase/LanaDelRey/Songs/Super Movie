Drop me off at the Copacabana
You're my one true love, aren't you man, ah?
I'm your little Super 8 movie
You know I'm in love with ya truly, yeah
So when, baby, if you
Don't get down (ah ah ah)
Don't get down

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
It's finally time to make a safe get away
I could not be happier

Drop me off, Santo Casino
I got an idea, why don't we go to Mexico?
Like we said we would, and you, don't want, want to
But I think, I think it'd be good for you, Billy
You never want to do nothing anymore and I
Remember the days when you used to sway and you'd

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
It's finally time to make a safe get away
I love you, baby

What happened to us? Me and you?
I was funny once and you were funny, too
One day, we woke up and I found that we had grew
And only I wasn't me, I had come out blue
And you, I don't know what to make of you
You're not a color, you're more of a shape
Of your former self, like they say, babe
I remember the days when you'd

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
And I'll continue always to keep that way

Yellow, red or blue
Don't matter to me if it don't matter to you
We'll just keep on trucking and see what we do and
I remember every way that you love me, baby

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
Top down, howling "Vegas" all the way
We almost had it all, didn't we, baby?
