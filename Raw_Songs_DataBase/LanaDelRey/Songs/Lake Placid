He don't like no spotlight
He the kinda man, stand real quiet
He don't wanna go, go home
He don't wanna go, go home

He's a sweet baby, but he looks mean
In his soft leather, and his blue jeans
He don't wanna go, go
He don't wanna go, go, go

You are just an American boy, you got your youth and you got your dreams
You ride your Harley like there's nothing to lose, you got the wind, but you're not free

And you don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
We don't wanna go, go home
Baby tonight
Baby tonight

He don't like no small things
He be riding round on some tall dreams
He don't wanna go, go home
He don't wanna go, go home

Hollywood sun, small town things
Probably he's changed, that's why he drinks
He don't wanna go, go home
He don't wanna go, go home

He was just an American kid, liked rock and roll and wanted to have fun
He felt the same way all of us did like probably he was the only one

And you don't wanna go, go home
I won't wanna go, go home
We won't wanna go, go home
Baby tonight
Baby tonight

I was just an American girl, I was reaching for the sun
I never really had big dreams when I saw you, were my only one
And I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby tonight
Baby tonight
Baby tonight
Baby tonight
