Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Mm-mm, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Come on, come on

I hope you remember me like this
Smoking cigarettes in my sundress
Glamorous and gangster, oh yes
(My battle lines look like paradise next to you)
I hope I remember you just like that
Looking fresh to death in your ball cap
You say you'll tap it like a hi-hat
(Your stupid lines, they're like dynamite)

The future's looking bright as black tonight
You tell me that our love cannot endure
Baby, if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right
Oh, I don't know a thing of this, I'm sure

There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathing heavily
The way you're smiling, it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swinging in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothing but that t-t-television on
We're kissing in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you
(And now, here's Johnny!)

I wonder if you'll think of me like this
On your fire escape like a hot mess
You say, "You're beautiful but hopeless"
("Come on inside, oh, you crazy child, look at you")
I promise that I'll think of you as the king
Quoting Corleone like you're so mean
It's Cosa Nostra 'cause it's our thing
(I made you mine like a thousand times)

Lucy's in the sky with ice tonight
Heaven knows I've tried hard to find a cure
Baby, if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right
And if you ask again, I'll say I'm sure

There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathing heavily
The way you're smiling, it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swinging in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothing but that t-t-television on
We're kissing in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you

Stay up tonight, turn out the light
It feels so right, baby, you're a vision in blues
Stay up tonight, turn out the light
It feels so right, watching television with you

There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathing heavily
The way you're smiling, it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swinging in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothing but that t-t-television on
We're kissing in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you
