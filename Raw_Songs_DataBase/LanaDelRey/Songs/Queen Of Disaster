What you do to me is indescribable
Got me sparkling just like an emerald
Set my soul on fire and make me wild
Like the deep blue sea
No other boy ever made me feel beautiful
When I'm in your arms, feel like I have it all
Is it your tattoos or golden grill
That makes me feel this way?

Got me spinning like a ballerina
Feeling gangster every time I see ya
You're the king and, baby, I'm the queen of
Disaster, disaster
Got me spinning like a ballerina
You're the bad boy that I always dreamed of
You're the king and, baby, I'm the queen of
Disaster, disaster

Got mascara thick, I get emotional
You know, I was more than just a party girl
Isn't hard to see what's going on
I'm so far gone (Mm, so far gone)
When I saw your face, it was incredible
Painted on my soul, it was indelible ('Cause you're the one)
Let's celebrate our twisted fate
We're the broken ones

Got me spinning like a ballerina
Feeling gangster every time I see ya
You're the king and, baby, I'm the queen of
Disaster, disaster
You got me spinning like a ballerina
You're the bad boy that I always dreamed of
You're the king and baby, I'm the queen of
Disaster, disaster

Ladies and gentlemen
For the very first time!

You got me spinning like a ballerina
Feeling gangster every time I see ya
You're the king and, baby, I'm the queen of
Disaster (Disaster), disaster (Disaster)
You got me spinning like a ballerina
You're the bad boy that I always dreamed of
You're the king and I'm the beauty queen of
Disaster, disaster
