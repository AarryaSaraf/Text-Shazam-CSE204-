My baby daddy a crooked cop
I know it's stupid but I cannot stop
I like the way that you move the stick
And every way when you make it sick, ah-ah

He got a bad reputation on the streets, but
In the house you're like a bag full of sweets, what?
He says I'm his snowflake ice queen, oh
I just can't, 'cause he treat me so mean, oh

Ah-ah-ah-ah, I like it
Ah-ah-ah-ah, I like it
Ah-ah-ah-ah, I like it, ooh
