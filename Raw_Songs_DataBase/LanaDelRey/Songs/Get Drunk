I am sleeping with your best friend
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now?
I am sleeping with your best friend
How do you like me now?
How do you like me now?

Come on, get drunk
You know you wanna
I am, you can
Won't tell no one about it
It's gonna be a ball
It's gonna be a ball

I am lying, using again
Come on
It's gonna be a ball

Come on, get drunk
You know you wanna
I am, you can
Won't tell no one about it
It's gonna be a ball
It's gonna be a ball

Cigarettes, Robitussin
Will I ever get to heaven?
Cigarettes, Robitussin
Will I ever get to heaven?
It's not looking good now, oh
It's not looking good now

Come on, get drunk
You know you wanna
Come on, get drunk
Get drunk, get drunk
Get drunk, get drunk
Get drunk, get drunk
Get drunk
