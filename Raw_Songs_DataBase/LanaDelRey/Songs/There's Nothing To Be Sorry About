Little boy
Living without you won't be easy to do
Little boy
You are the love of my life
And if you don't wanna talk to me
Well, then I think that's alright

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
My love

Knowing you are hurt inside
I think of all your happy times
Oh, my
When I ask what I can do
You say remember me the way I was six months ago, oh
I could do so much more for you, y'know
I could make you well if you just asked me to
Oh

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
I'll do anything
For you or for him
Or whoever else needs some help out there
I swear, I swear

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
Always

Think of you on quiet nights
At traffic lights and
Every highway and
I get a little scared sometimes when
Everyone I meet I find has
A friend

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
My love
