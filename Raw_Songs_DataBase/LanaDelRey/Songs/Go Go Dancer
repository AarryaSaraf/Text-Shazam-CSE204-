I drop it like it's hot on the pole, on the pole
Shining in the club, neon gold, neon gold
They call me "Firecracker" and alcohol's a factor
I drop it like it's hot, baby bold, baby bold
A little bit of fun for your soul, for your soul
They call me "Firecracker", 'cause ain't nobody faster

I'm your go-go dancer, midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart, queen of the night
Vegas baby, if you pay me
Anything you like, anything you like
Go-go dancer, midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart, Queen of the night
Vegas baby, if you pay me
Anything you like
Go-go-g-go-go dancer tonight

Pushing up my (uh), in your face, in your face
Keep your fingertips on my waist, on my waist
I'm your go-go dancer, credit card romancer
Corner of the road with the lights and the lace
Catch me after twelve, in the place, yeah, the place
Boy, break out your dollars, baby needs a new fur

I'm your go-go dancer, midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart, queen of the night
Vegas baby, if you pay me
Anything you like, anything you like
Go-go dancer, midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart, Queen of the night
Vegas baby, if you pay me
Anything you like
Go-go-g-go-go dancer tonight

I'm the girl next door, let me come in
I know I go-go dance but I do it for kicks
I never have to work 'cause my daddy is rich
I'm partying all night, shining in the lights
Is it a crime to wanna shine
In my white go-go boots and my silver design?
I know it makes you wild
I know it makes you wild

I'm your go-go dancer, midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart, queen of the night
Vegas baby, if you pay me
Anything you like, anything you like
Go-go dancer, midnight answer
Jukebox sweetheart, Queen of the night
Vegas baby, if you pay me
Anything you like
Go-go-g-go-go dancer tonight
