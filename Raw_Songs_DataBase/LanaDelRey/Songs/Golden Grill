What happened to 'nobody does it better'?
See ya walking 'round like you were born to kill
Driving in your Escalade flash that golden grill
You're picking up a bad habit you get the ones that no one will
Where did your love go babe before you turned criminal?

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

So here we are, there we go and that's the way
That you gonna roll, that you gonna fight, gonna play
It doesn't really matter to me that you find your way
You've been gone for so long that you're a shell of yourself babe

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

The sun once shined for you
I've changed my mind for you
Your golden day has turned to night
Your golden day has been denied

There's no more chances for you now, you never learn
You lit my fire baby, but I just got burned

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happen to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way
