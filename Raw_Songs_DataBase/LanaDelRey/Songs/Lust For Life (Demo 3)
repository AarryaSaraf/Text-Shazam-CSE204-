One foot in the door
I've been trying
To get your attention
Is it working out yet?
Love me or love me not
I don't care anymore
But baby, I've been dying
To get your attention
And I was like

Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't us
Plus you're having too much fun
You're not in a rush

But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive

My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever
There's no more night, blue skies forever

One day or one night
I've been trying
To make a connection
Is it working or not?
Love me or love me not
I don't care anymore
Cause babe I've been dying
To taste your affection
And I was like

Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't us
Plus you're having too much fun
You're not in a rush

But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive

My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever
There's no more night, blue skies forever
