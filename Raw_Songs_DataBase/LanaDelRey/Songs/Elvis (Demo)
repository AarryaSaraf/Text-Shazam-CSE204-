Platinum and vale acrylics
Skim the paper for the critics
Baby's breathing Elvis lyrics
On the copper bar
Late in motel lounges singing
Spotlight on the band is swinging
Chateau Marmont memories fading
Hope is very far

Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my Chantilly lace catching
Baby, on the chandelier

Sweeping scents and blue hydrangea
Summer hail and summer stranger
Baby, he's in constant danger
Help is very far
You look like a Florida native
"Are you?" I said, at the rate of
Slow molasses from the state of
Vermont with a Southern drawl

Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my Chantilly lace is catching
On the chandelier

He said he'd come to welcome, warn me
Just your diamond to adorn me
Come to be and see the one and only
For my final year
Well, thank you

Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my Chantilly lace is catching
On the chandelier
It's catching on that chandelier
It's catching on that chandelier
Where are you when I need you most?
