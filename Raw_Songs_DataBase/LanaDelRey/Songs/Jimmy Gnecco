I say, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
I like the way your name echo
You are so fine"
I say, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
Do you wanna help me let go
Of my dark mind?"

If you want it, it's yours
It's free, but of course
You're my sunshine
I say, "J, you're the boss
Without you I'm lost
You're my sunshine"

I say, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
You are on another level
You are so fine"
I say, "Hey Jimmy, let's go
I've been in love since I met you
You are all mine"

If you want it, it's yours
It's free, but of course
Take a high ride
I say, "J, you're the boss
Without you I'm lost
You're my sunshine."

Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, take me to the park
Buy me a hot dog, kiss me in the dark, dark
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, take me to the park
Buy me cotton candy, kiss me in the dark

I say, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
Hey, I like your heavy metal
Do you like mine?"
I said, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
You were smashing from the get-go
This is your time"

If you want it, it's yours
It's free, but of course
Take a high ride
I say, "J, you're the boss
Without you I'm lost
You're my sunshine"

Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, take me to the park
Buy pink cotton candy and kiss me in the dark, dark
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, take me to the park
Buy me something pretty and kiss me in the dark

Jimmy Gnecco, Jimmy Gnecco, Jimmy Gnecco
You are so fine
