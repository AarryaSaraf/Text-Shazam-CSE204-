Motel six, sloe gin fizz
Swinging in the lobby, do the sunset twist
I can do it, you can do it, move them hips
Come on everybody, get dangerous

Fellas, if you wanna get that invite quicker
Pack up the pick-up, pick up the liquor
Go on, use your charm right, so come on, gonna get her
It's about time:

Ladies, if you really wanna reign them suckers
Line up your lips, plump up your puckers
It's about the only way to get them motherfuckers
To do what you want to

It's a party, it's a party
We're so naughty come on
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party
Come on Johnny, baby this is where belong

Motel six, sloe gin fizz
Swinging in the lobby, do the sunset twist
I can do it, you can do it, move them hips
Everybody, let's get dangerous

Ladies, if you really wanna know my secret
Come a little closer, kitty, promise you'll keep it
Come a little nearer, dear, you gonna need it
Gonna tell you:

It's a party, it's a party
We're so naughty!
Come on Johnny, do it, do it, do it, come on!
It's a party, it's a party
It's a party, it's a party
Come on Johnny maybe this is where we belong

Baby, we can go down to 7-Eleven
Drive down the drag in your Pontiac Heaven
Baby, you can buy me Diet Mountain Dew
And we'll get right down to it, me and you
Laying on your hood like it's a flatbed truck
In the spotlight, we see Jim and Chuck
We saw that car from a mile away and it's slowing
They say there's a motel dance, let's get going

It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
We're so naughty!
Come on Johnny, do it, do it, do it, come on!
It's a party, it's a party
That we started Come on Johnny this is where we belong!
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
We're so naughty!
Come on Johnny, do it, do it, do it, come on!
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
That we started Come on Johnny this is where we belong!

Motel six, sloe gin fizz


It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
Do it do it do it come on
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, c-c-come on
