My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the Houses of the Holy, smoking on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck, he was cool as heck

But you were so obsessed with writing
The next best American record
That there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby, that's a shame
You were so obsessed with writing
The next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame

You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out?
You did it all for fame
Baby, how's life treating you now that it's over?

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was seventies in spirit, nineties in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space, we lost track of time

But you were so obsessed with writing
The next best American record
That there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby, that's a shame
You were so obsessed with writing
The next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame
You know what I'm talking about

You did it all for fame
Tell me how life treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out?
Now that you lost the game
Honey, how's life treating you now that it's over?
Baby, how you feeling now that I told ya?

It's you, all the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do
All the things that I say
It's true, all the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls love the way Bill plays guitar

You did it all for fame
Tell me how life treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out?
You did it all for fame
Honey, how's life feeling now that it's over?
Baby, how's life treating you now that I told ya?
Honey, how's it feeling now that I told you?
Honey, how's it feeling? I told you
Honey, how's it feeling?
Honey, how's it feeling? I told you
