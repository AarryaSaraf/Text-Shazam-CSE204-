Ooh, ooh. (What?)
Ooh, ooh. (That's dope)
Ooh, ooh. (What?)
Ooh, ooh

Love you like I never loved anyone
Keep me burning hot like the red, red sun
Want you like I never wanted anyone
You give it to me fast like free and fun

Every time with you
It feels like I'm in summer
I don't know why
Maybe cause you're so cool and keep it on the real
Like sugar, sugar, fly

Boy you're sweet like sugar cane
Make me feel alive again

I'm going down, down
Take you down to paradise
(Rock you like a real bad baby)
La, love, lick you like vanilla ice
(Lick you up and make you crazy)
Shut up, give me what you got
You can buy my hot supersonic pow
Going down, down
Take you down to paradise

Want you like I never wanted anyone
Got a face like God and a bod' like drawn
Kiss you like I never kissed anyone
'Cause you keep it really rough like, oh my God

Every time with you I can tell it's forever
I don't know how
And even if it's not, you know I couldn't stop
You make my heart go pow

Coming down like pouring rain
Make me feel alive again

I'm going down, down
Take you down to paradise
(Rock you like a real bad baby)
La, love, lick you like vanilla ice
(Lick you up and make you crazy)
Shut up, give me what you got
You can rock my hot supersonic pow
Down, down, take you down to paradise
(How do you like that, baby?)

Down down, take you down to paradise
Down down, take you down to paradise

Ooh, ooh. Dope!
Ooh, ooh. That's sick!
Ooh, ooh. Dope!
Ooh, ooh. That's sick!
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Shut up, give me what you got
You can buy my hot supersonic pop

I'm going down, down
Take you down to paradise
(Rock you like a real bad baby)
La, love, lick you like vanilla ice
(Lick you up and make you crazy)
Shut up, give me what you got
You can buy my hot supersonic pop
Going down, down
Take you down to paradise
