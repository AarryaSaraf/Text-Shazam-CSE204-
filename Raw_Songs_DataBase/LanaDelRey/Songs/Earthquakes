Earthquakes happen regularly down in California
Walls shake, but I don't move, I put the record on and enjoy it
I dance, dancin' in my underwear, I let the 70s rock and roll me
Laurel Canyon, can you feel my power?
Overdose on opium, yeah

Just say I've gone crazy
I don't know what's overcome me
Just say you're my baby, but
I'm feeling tired and I think I'm done, yeah

You can say what you really want
You can say what you really think
Just say goodbye to the sweet Pacific
Goodbye to your lonely queen

Earthquakes happen naturally down in California
Walls shake, but I don't give a shit, 'cuz dying's better for ya
Fuck life, everything here sucks, there's no music anymore, yeah
I pray that he takes me in
The next big 9.4, yeah

Just say I've gone crazy
I don't know what's overcome me
Just say you're my baby, but
I'm feeling tired and I think I'm done, yeah

You can say what you really want
You can say what you really think
Just say goodbye to the sweet Pacific
Goodbye to your lonely queen

You can say what you really think
Just say goodbye to the sweet Pacific
Goodbye to your lonely queen
