Methamphetamines, pink flamingo
Blue 50's queen, blue oyster cove
For the big dream, why don't we go
To Coney Island?
When the hour numb the guy lies on
The record spins blue '50s song
The veranda looks ocean now
Neon palms sway
What's happening? Where did we go?
The Jersey Shore was long ago
As with our hopes and ocean grove
And so I bid you farewell
