30 blocks to Fordham Road
That's a bad neighborhood
Crack house on the corner
I know I shouldn't do what it is I could

The stone Mary in the garden
She let me know she watching
She said I better get walking
I better walk away

I don't know why it is that I wanna stay
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away

I catch a dollar in the wind and I
Buy a cup of coffee
There's a place on Valentine
That still charge ninety cents
I keep on walking in the daytime
And in my eyes, it's always nighttime
And I like it when it's me at night
'Cause that's when all the stars come out
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh

I don't know why it is that I wanna stay
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away

It's the greatest, it's the greatest day
It's the greatest, it's the greatest day, oh

I'm not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away
