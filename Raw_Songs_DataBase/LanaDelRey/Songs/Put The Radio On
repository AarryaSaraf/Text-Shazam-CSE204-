Put the radio on
Put the radio on (hello)
I don't wanna know I'm wrong
I don't wanna know I'm wrong

Sugar and spice, everything nice
Keep me on lock-down, put me on ice
'Cause I'm a really good girl, you a very bad guy
We're a little match made in Heaven if I say so, Yay-o
Come over here, boy, and play-o

Work it out, work it right
Baby's lock 'n load tonight
Work it out, keep it tight
You're so rock and roll
Sold your soul now, baby

Put the radio on
Put the radio on (yes, yes)
I don't wanna know I'm wrong
I don't wanna know I'm wrong
Put the radio on (and take a breath)
Put the radio on (come over here)
I don't wanna know I'm wrong
I don't wanna know I'm wrong for you

Peaches and cream, everyone's dream
You think you like me now? You should hear me sing
'Cause baby, I'm a fly girl and you're a big shot
If we got together, I know it would be hot-hot
Say so, stay-o, I'll give you something to pray for

Work it out, work it right
Baby's lock 'n load tonight
Work it out, keep it tight
You're so rock and roll
Sold your soul now, baby

Put the radio on
Put the radio on (yes, yes)
I don't wanna know I'm wrong
I don't wanna know I'm wrong
Put the radio on (and take a breath)
Put the radio on (come over here)
I don't wanna know I'm wrong
I don't wanna know I'm wrong for you

I'm waiting by your back-door
Let me come in
I got your favorite dress on
Long hair, pinned up

I like you lots, polka dots
Hope desire's in your thoughts
Thinking of you, dreaming of us
I like you lots, polka dots
Hope desire's in your thoughts
Thinking of you, dreaming of us

Put the radio on
Put the radio on (yes, yes)
I don't wanna know I'm wrong
I don't wanna know I'm wrong
Put the radio on (and take a breath)
Put the radio on (come over here)
I don't wanna know I'm wrong
I don't wanna know I'm wrong for you

You know I got a taste for tonic and gin
You know I got an eye for fur and fine things
You know that I'm to die for, baby, give in
I told you when we met what you were in for

Put the radio on
Put the radio on (yes, yes)
I don't wanna know I'm wrong
I don't wanna know I'm wrong
Put the radio on (and take a breath)
Put the radio on (come over here)
I don't wanna know I'm wrong
I don't wanna know I'm wrong for you
