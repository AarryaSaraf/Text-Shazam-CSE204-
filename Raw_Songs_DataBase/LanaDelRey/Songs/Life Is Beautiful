Don't be that way
Don't you pretend
You're not awake
When you know you are
I see the way
You're lying there
I know you can't
Be very far

God wouldn't do that
He knows how I feel
I can't go through that
And so it's not real

Life is still so beautiful
Life is still so beautiful

Don't be so still
You never are
You like to play
Your soul's on fire
I don't believe this is the end
And I still feel your heart's desire

God couldn't do that
He knows you belong
To me and me only
And so I'll be strong

Life is still so beautiful
Life is still so beautiful

Come on, boy, let's go
We can hit the road
We don't have to say
Where we're going
We can go anywhere
We can go anywhere
We can go anywhere
Right now

Life is still so beautiful
Life is still so beautiful
