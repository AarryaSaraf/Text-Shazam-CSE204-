I was lounging at the Chateau Marmont
Glimmering by the swimming pool
My man walked in like a slow-motion movie
I said, "You're so cool."

I heard a man screaming, "Lights, camera, action!"
I c-c-can't remember what happened
I overdose, you throw me over your shoulder
I was dying, you were screaming
"Open up that Lamborghini."

Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Open up your butterfly doors
(What do you say?)
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Let's ch-ch-change our DNA
Let's change our DNA

You're the king mafia baby
I'm the Queen of Alchemy
I know a way to make gold
By mixing our souls to escape reality

Me and Monterrey went to that ocean
I got that magical trance potion
Gotta leave, I can't wait 'til I'm older
You was laughing, I was running
Use that remote to open up

Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Open up your butterfly doors
(What do you say?)
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Let's ch-ch-change our DNA
Let's change our DNA

You can be my higher power, baby
I can be your endless USA
We can go on drives for hours, baby
Let's cha-a-ange our DNA
Let's change our DNA
Let's change

Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Open up your butterfly doors
(What do you say?)
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Let's ch-ch-change our DNA
Let's change our DNA

Heavy hitter
