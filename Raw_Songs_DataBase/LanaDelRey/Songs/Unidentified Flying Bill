Bill takes me down to the beach
In the coat that he got from his father
He whispers to me that sometimes
He thinks he sees things over the water
Like maybe UFOs or something
Flying in the air
Well, I don't know about those, Bill
But I don't care

Slow burn, I'm hot like a fire
I'm sober, but you're getting higher
Life is so crazy, I can't take it
But at least we've got the night
We still got tonight

Bill takes me down to the beach
In East Hampton and walks on the water
Says they don't know it yet
But I'm the second coming of the Father
And he keeps on fishing
Tryna turn one into twenty
He's turnin' the ocean into wine for the summertime

Slow burn, I'm hot like a fire
I'm sober, but you're getting higher
Life is so crazy, I can't take it
But at least we've got tonight
We still got tonight
We still got tonight
We still got tonight

Tell it to me
Tell me I'm wrong
Come to me
Come to me
Tell me I'm wrong
Come to me
Send me, now
Tell me I'm wrong
(Tell me I'm wrong)
Ohh

Slow burn, I'm hot like a fire
I'm sober, but you're still getting higher
Life is so crazy, I can't take it
But at least we've got the night
We still got the night
