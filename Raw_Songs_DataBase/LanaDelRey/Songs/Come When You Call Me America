A-M-E-R-I-C-A
Ah-ah-ay

Come when you call me
Come when you call me

Just like you wanna know why
Just like you said so, night
I can do whatever I want
You can do whatever you
It's just like I always wanted
Just like I always knew

Riding my time
Have a night life
Have a night life
Head to head
Gun to gun
Now we're gonna
Have some fun
(Hey-ah)

Come when you call me
Come when you call me

This what I wanna know why
Just like you said so, night
(Hey-ah)

Riding my time
Have a night life (have a night life)
I know what you
Been looking for
I think I got
All that and more
I think I know
What you been trying
Saying, "Everybody wants a little time."

Come when you call me
Come when you
(A-M-E-R-I-C-A)

Just like you wanna know why
Just like you said so, night
(A-M-E-R-I-C-A)
I can do whatever I want
You can do whatever you
This is like I always wanted
Just like I always knew
(Tell me a story, daddy)

Come when you call me
Come when you
(A-M-E-R-I-C-A)

You can say whatever
You gonna say about me
(A-M-E-R-I-C-A)
You can say whatever
You gonna say about me
(A-M-E-R-I-C-A)
You can say whatever
You gonna say about me
(I like you, I like)
(A-M-E-R-I-C-A)

Hey-ah, ooh
Hey-ah, ooh
Stay in your room
Get in your bed
Maybe they can get me
Inside your head
(A-M-E-R-I-C-A)
Tell me a story, daddy
