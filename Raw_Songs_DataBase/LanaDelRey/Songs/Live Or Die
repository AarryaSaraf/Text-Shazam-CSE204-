(Die, die, die, die)

Baby, you my Bugsy Malone and I'm your suicide blonde
You can be my film noir star I'm your Queen of Saigon
If they don't think we're good together
Baby, just forget 'em and let bygones be bygones

Baby, I can't go it alone, 'cause you're the one that I want
You can be my Tony Montana and I can be your Pfeiffer
Fire, I can take you higher
I can get you hooked on love and desire

Hello, pretty baby, I can be your cherry pie
You walk into the room, my heart goes boom
Send me to the sky

So tonight, are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die
Are you gonna be my lover?
Are we gonna be true love's suicide?
(Suicide, suicide)
It's either live or die

I be murdering 'em, murdering 'em just for fun (Hey)
I be murdering 'em, murdering 'em one by one (Hey)
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die
I be murdering 'em, murdering 'em just for fun (Hey)
I be murdering 'em, murdering 'em one by one (Hey)
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die
(Die, die, it's either live or die)

Baby, you Sylvester Stallone and I could be your Adrian
With tender lips, I got you in the ring, just say my name again
Say my name again, say my name again
Say my name, say my name
Say my name again

Baby, I can't go it alone 'cause you're the one that I want
You can be my Tommy Mottola and I can be Mariah, tiger
(Meow)
I can get you hooked on drugs and desire

Hello, pretty baby, I can be your cherry pie
You walk into the room, my heart goes boom
Send me to the sky

So tonight, are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die
Are you gonna be my lover?
Are we gonna be true love's suicide?
(Suicide, suicide)
It's either live or die

I be murdering 'em, murdering 'em just for fun (Hey)

I be murdering 'em, murdering 'em just for fun (Hey)
I be murdering 'em, murdering 'em one by one (Hey)
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die

Would you kill for me?
Would you die for me?
Put your hands where I can see them
Put them in the air

So tonight, are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
It's either live or die, boy, it's either live or die
Are you gonna be my lover?
Are we gonna be true love's suicide?
(Suicide, suicide)
It's either live or die
