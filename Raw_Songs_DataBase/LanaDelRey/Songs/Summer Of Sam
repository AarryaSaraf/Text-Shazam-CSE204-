Like the summer of Sam, back in '69
I'd be heavenly, deadly on the grind
'Cause to sing this nice has to be a crime
I be murdering and murdering 'em

Like the summer of love back in '69
You can say that I'm yours, but my body is divine
I belong to everybody that I walk by
Like hi, hi
I'm the master of my destiny
You haven't seen the best of me
And if you want the rest of me
You'll have to pay a lovely fee
Hard to stay far, far away from me
'Cause I am the baddest girl in NYC
You can look but please don't touch, boy
Stay away from me

Baby, I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it fresh on the far east side
Baby, I'm a tenement girl
Keeping it in touch, your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Baby, I'm a dangerous girl
You should stay away from me

I've been murdering and murdering 'em
I be murdering and murdering 'em

Like the summer of Sam, back in '69
I'll be tying them up, and hang 'em out to dry
'Cause I'm hot like that when I walk, they die
I be murdering and murdering 'em

Like the summer of love back in '69
When I get on the microphone my, my
They be looking at each other like ay, ay, ay
Like bye, bye

Please excuse m-my vivacity, capacity for hating
'Cause it's incredible
It's better if you stay away from me
I know it's hard, hard to stay far, far away from me
I am the baddest girl in NYC
You can look but please don't touch
But boy, step away from me

Baby, I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it fresh, on the e-east side
Baby, I'm a tenement girl
Keeping it in touch, your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Baby, I'm a dangerous girl
Baby, you should stay away from me

I've been murdering and murdering 'em
Happily
Murdering and murdering 'em ah, ah
Murdering and murdering 'em

I'm diggable, predictable
No, everyone knows all my people
I'll give you a fistful
You know you'll be in a fight
Unmissable, invincible, behavior is despicable
If you're looking for fun you can come out with me tonight

I am the baddest girl in NYC
I am the baddest, ya liking what you see? Yup!

Baby, I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it sweet, on the far east side
Baby, I'm a tenement girl
Keeping it in touch, your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Honey, I'm a dangerous girl
You should stay away from me
