He's Jesus Christ
And I'm his babydoll
I'm his favourite human but he saved them all

He's my personal saviour
He's my personal saviour

Jesus is my boyfriend
Jesus is my boyfriend
Jesus is my boyfriend
Jesus is my boyfriend

He's my personal saviour
He's my personal angel
My God thinks I'm smashing
He thinks I'm fine
My God takes me dashing cross the party line

He's my personal saviour
He's my personal saviour
My God treats me special
Gives me lots of things
I had some of his boyfriends offer diamond rings

He's my personal saviour
He's my personal saviour

He's my personal angel
He's my cherry pie
Said to call him "Dick Chasey"
He's my private eye
When I get in my gown
He comes to me in the night
