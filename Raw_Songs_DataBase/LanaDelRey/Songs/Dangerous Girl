He's my drugstore cowboy
Italian alloy, classical American
And I'm America's sweetheart
Chic, delicious, sweet tart
Sipping on my Diet Coke
Singing in the trailer park

He like my jeans tight (Yeah)
He likes me mean, right? (Right)
He like my long hair, corset, heels high
We were born to kill, stripped for success
I'm his sweet mess
Do you love me? Yes, yes
Hell yes!

Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
(Going Nero, Nero)
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life
(You're my hero, hero)

Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl

He's the get-rich-quick type
Mafioso-hit type
Girl, I'm gonna marry him
I'm the bad girl next door
Baby's always wanting more
Buying diamond jewelry
Take me to the Jersey Shore

He like my mink white (White)
We go out all night (Night)
We're living off the grid
Shining in the crime light
We were born to kill, best of the best
The new Wild West
Honey, put on that party dress
Hell yes!

Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
(Going Nero, Nero)
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life
(You're my hero, hero)

Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl

Me and my baby planning world domination
Together, taking over our fair nation
'Cause we're born to kill, keeping it fresh
Gold chain, white mesh
Fame is the name of the game
Yes, yes (Yes, yes, yes, yes)

Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
(Going Nero, Nero)
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life
(You're my hero, hero)
Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
(Going Nero, Nero)
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life
(You're my hero, hero)

Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl

Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
(Going Nero, Nero)
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life
(You're my hero, hero)

Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
