This is stupid, this whole sober
This is stupid, this whole sober thing
All the boys with me like to drink
This is stupid, this whole music thing
I'm burnt out, and I don't wanna sing

But I've got nothing better, but my sleeve
If life can't be fun, then I guess I'll have to leave
I said, "Run motorcycle run"
Run motorcycle run

Am I lovely? Flowers in my hair
Do you love me? You, yes you over there
Everybody asks me who I am
I'm nobody, I'm only a man

And I got nothing better, but my sleeve
If life can't be fun, then I guess I'll have to leave
So I say "Run motorcycle run"
Run motorcycle run
Run motorcycle run
Run motorcycle run
