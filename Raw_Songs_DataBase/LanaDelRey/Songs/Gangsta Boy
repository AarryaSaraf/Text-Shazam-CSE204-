My gangsta boy
Ooh, oh, oh, oh

I don't care if you're going to prison
I wouldn't say I l-love you if I didn't
I can't cheat cause I know what I'm missing
Boop-boop-boopty-doo (ah)
I won't play cause I'm already winning
Kissing your lips, hot-hot like I'm sinning
High school, loved you from the beginning
Boop-boop-boopty-doo

I want you, you, you, by my swimming pool
You, you, you, that would be so cool

You're my gangsta boy
You're my gangsta boy
'Cause you're my favorite toy
You're my favorite toy
Get you out, hit you up
No, I'll never, ever stop
You're my gangsta boy
You're my gangsta boy

Ooh-hoo
B-b-b-b-b-boy
Ooh-hoo
B-b-b-b-b-boy
Ooh-hoo
B-b-b-b-b-boy
My gangsta boy

I don't care what my girls or mama
Say about you, bad boy, I like the drama
We can ditch 'em all while you're out, if you wanna
Boop-boop-boopty-doo
Like your leather and your long hair, honey-honey
You can bring your love and baby, I got the money
Love you baby boy, like I never loved nobody
Boop-boop-boopty-doo

I want you, you, you, by my swimming pool
You, you, you, that would be so cool

You're my gangsta boy
You're my gangsta boy
'Cause you're my favorite toy
You're my favorite toy
Get you out, hit you up
No, I'll never, ever stop
You're my gangsta boy
You're my gangsta boy

Ooh-hoo
B-b-b-b-b-boy
Ooh-hoo
B-b-b-b-b-boy
Ooh-hoo
B-b-b-b-b-boy
My gangsta boy

Summer's almost over, baby
Everybody thinks I'm crazy
I could have it all
But it means nothing without you
Boy, I've been so lonely lately
I'll never get tired of waiting
I could have the world
But it means nothing without you

You're my gangsta boy
You're my gangsta boy
'Cause you're my favorite toy
You're my favorite toy (ooh!)

You're my gangsta boy
You're my gangsta boy
'Cause you're my favorite toy
You're my favorite toy
Get you out, hit you up
No, I'll never, ever stop
You're my gangsta boy
You're my gangsta boy

Ooh-hoo
B-b-b-b-b-boy
Ooh-hoo
B-b-b-b-b-boy
Ooh-hoo
B-b-b-b-b-boy
My gangsta boy
Ooh-hoo
B-b-b-b-b-boy
Ooh-hoo

Ooh-hoo
B-b-b-b-b-boy
My gangsta boy
