I guess it's symptomatic of a slight infatuation
Stalking you has sorta become like my occupation
Used to be a beauty queen with simple acquisitions
Met my local rock star now I'm having visions

I fell for you, you like me too
Let's get it on, check one, two
I fell for you, you want me too
Let's get it on

Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
I'm making out with you while you're singing your song
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
You're playing your guitar and it's turning me on
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walking around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your car like a star
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it's wrong, I don't wanna be right

I get so systematic in this kind of situation
I need it, have to have it, t-take over, domination
Used to be so simple, never wanting, never wishing
Now I'm hooked on fame and I'm a girl on a mission

I fall for you, it's all for you
Let's get it on, check one, two
I fall for you, it's all for you
Let's get it on

Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
I'm making out with you while you're singing your song
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
You're playing your guitar and it's turning me on
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walking around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your car like a star
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it's wrong, I don't wanna be right

A funny little thing about love is that you're blind all the time
And even when you think you had enough
You're wanting more, it isn't right but
You can't stop

You got your eyeliner, long hair, walking around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your ca-ca-ca-car-r-r
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walking around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your ca-ca-ca-car-r-r
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it's wrong I don't wanna be right
