Don't tell me that I'm fine
You break me all the time when you don't mean to
Yo, heartbreak's not a crime
But maybe it should be when it comes to you
I don't really know why you do them things
But maybe now, baby, if I start to sing
I can knock a little sense into you

What's a stupid girl to do
When she loves somebody as fucked up like you
Where am I supposed to go
When the only boy I ever knew said no
Absolutely nothing

Don't tell me it's alright
You never really knew what you meant to me
I'm, I'm crying every night
Because everything's so strange when you're not with me

And I don't really know why you had to go
But I have to trust that only God can know
If I pray, maybe I'll find out what's true

What's a stupid girl to do
When she loves somebody as fucked up like you
Where am I supposed to go
When the only boy I ever knew said no
Absolutely nothing

Ahh, ahh, uh uh oh
Ahh, ahh, uh uh oh

You break me down
I get back up
You're telling me
I say "What's up"
Nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
Can't go back to you

What's a stupid girl to do
When she loves somebody as fucked up as you
And where am I supposed to go
When the only boy I ever loved said no
Absolutely nothing

Absolutely nothing, no
Absolutely nothing
Absolutely nothing, no
Absolutely nothing
Absolutely nothing, no
Absolutely nothing
