You smell like a million roses
Bathed in rock 'n' roll
Ours was the greatest
Love story ever told
Throat like an angel with a voice that was made of gold
That's my baby

He was the king of the town
With a crown that would never fall
A heart that would beat
Like a bass for his baby doll
One in a million, inimitable soul
That's my baby

Young or old, summer or cold
Young or old, summer or cold

You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy

He was the king of the town
With a crown that would never fall
A heart like a bass that would beat for his baby doll
Mind like a diamond
An un-imitable song
That's my baby

Young or old, summer or cold
Young or old, summer or cold

You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy
It drives me crazy

You've got it
And I want it
Late summer nights in July, flaunt it
You know that you can always come home
To the one who gave you your name
'Cause I see a light in your eyes
It's so bright, and
The skies, they open wide for you
So come to me, my baby

You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy

It drives me crazy
It drives me crazy
Crazy, oh, oh-oh
