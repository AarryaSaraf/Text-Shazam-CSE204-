You can whistle for it

Baby, you'll never grow old in my eyes
With your golden grill, true love never dies
You wanna watch me while I watch TV
While you're t-t-t-t-touching me
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride

We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in that Chevrolet from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Every man deserves to see the sunrise

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

You said I'd never make it out outta here alive
At the rate I was going, I'd be lucky to die
I was born so bad, not naturally right
The brightest star on Hollywood and Vine

We're gonna party like we're running outta time
We're getting drunk and driving fast on cherry wine
Never do belong to anyone I find
Leaving everything I ever knew behind

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Promised me this
Well, you lied

I learned how to make love from the movies
He found me waitressing at Ruby Tuesday's
He said I wanna buy you a classic white milkshake
I said I'll serve you up a special side of heartbreak
Special side of heartbreak
I was working down in the corner cafe
You drove by in a Chevrolet
Whistle at me as my hips go sway
Lana Del Rey, how you get that way?
How you get that way?
I said, "He loves my heart shaped sunglasses
He loves the heart shape my ass is
Cristal, crystal champagne glasses."

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Promised me this
Well, you lied
