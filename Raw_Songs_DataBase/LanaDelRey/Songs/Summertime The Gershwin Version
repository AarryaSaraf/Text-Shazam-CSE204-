Summertime
And the living is easy
Fish are jumping
And the cotton, the cotton is high

Oh, your daddy, he's rich
And your ma, she's good looking
So hush, little baby
Don't you cry

One of these mornings
You're gonna rise up singing
You gonna spread your wings
And take, and take to the sky
Until that morning
Ain't nothing can harm you
With daddy and mammy standing by

Standing by
Standing by, little baby
Standing by
