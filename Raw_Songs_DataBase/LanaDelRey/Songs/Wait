Wait a little longer kid
What you want to grow up so fast for?
Why you doing like I did?
Didn't you say I got what I asked for?

But you're afraid to find out
Like me and climb out
But you're always close to me
You got a different story
It's the same damn thing
Got a long way, rest your feet
I know you can do anything

You were such a handsome boy
Don't you give up your glory
Why you want to hit them streets?
Didn't you never hear my story?

And it's fine to waste time
But you got a beautiful mind
And you're always close to me
You're a different kid
But it's the same damn thing
And it's a long way, you better rest your feet
I know that you want everything

That's what you told me
I still believe you
I still see it's true
I need you and I know you, dear
But if you've gotta make it then
I can take it from here

Wait a little longer kid
Didn't I never say I would miss you?
Don't go until I come home
Please don't go until I kiss you

And it's hard to grow up
But we all know it's tough
Yeah, you're always close to me
You have a different story
It's the same damn thing
You got a long way, c'mon and rest your feet
I know you can do anything
