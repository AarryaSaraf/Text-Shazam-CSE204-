All that's real to me is Marilyn and Jesus
Jumping off'a bridges, sparklers and streamers, honey
I wanna die, I wanna die, I wanna die
All that's real to me is trailer parks and Jesus
Alabama freezes, platinum and peaches, honey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly

Don't you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Don't you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?
Don't you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Don't you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?

All that's real to me is ice cream trucks and Jesus
Coney Island beaches, chandeliers and seizures, honey
I wanna cry, I wanna cry, I wanna cry
All that's real to me is birthday cakes and beaches
Halloween and Jesus, fireworks and streamers, honey
I wanna die, I wanna die, I wanna die

Don't you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Don't you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't you know that there is really nobody like you? Yeah
Don't you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Know you wanna come to my motel, honey
Don't you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?

All I want is to feel good, all I want is to feel good
All I want is to feel good

Don't you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Don't you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't you know that I have never loved nobody but you? But you
