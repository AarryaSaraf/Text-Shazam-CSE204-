They say I'm wasting time, they say that I'm no good
Summer of my life, not doing what I should
Call me poison ivy 'cause I'm far from good
But pretty from afar, like a dark star

They think I'm dangerous, they think I'm really bad,
I'm just making up for what I never had
Go out every night whenever I feel sad
All this drive-by love got me crazy like a drug

I wear my red lipstick, got my make-up on
I'm Miss America, now I'm gone, baby, gone

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock'n'roll dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know

Mommy's Mercedes or Billy's pickup truck
Come home late at night and baby picks me up
Tell him just drive on and d-don't ever stop
Don't take me home again, take me to a new land

I wear my red lipstick, got my coat and gun
I'm Miss America, now I'm gone, baby, gone

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys,
Riding 'round town drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go.
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock'n'roll dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go.
Now we know, baby, now we know

I was born to live fast, die young
Leave a beautiful corpse, live my life on the run
I got my cash and my Louis Vuitton, diamonds and guns
Girls just wanna, just wanna have fun

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys,
Riding 'round town drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go.

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys,
Riding 'round town drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go.
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock'n'roll dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go.
Now we know, baby, now we know
