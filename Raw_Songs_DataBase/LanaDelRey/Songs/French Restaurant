Hit the streets, city beat
I know what you want
Talk to me softly
French restaurant
Every time I turn around
I look at you like we're now
I'm telling you, it's all true

I'm talking to him while I'm thinking of you
I'm trying my best, I don't know what to do
Talking to you, don't know what it's about

I know they think that I had everything
If I can't have you, then they can't have me
(I know it looks like I have everything)
If I can't have you, then they can't have me
(I know they think that I had everything)
Why am I crying on the balcony?
(I know it looks like I have everything)
If I can't have you, then they can't have me
(Honestly)

Super cool, swimming pool
Would you paint me sweet?
Look at you, playing cool
In the color of it all
Every time I turn around
I look at you like we're now
Can't one single thing
Be just what it appears to be?

I'm talking to him while I'm thinking of you
I'm trying my best, I don't know what to do
Talking to him, I don't know what it's about

I know they think that I had everything
If I can't have you, then they can't have me
(I know it looks like I have everything)
If I can't have you, then they can't have me
(I know they think that I had everything)
Why am I crying on the balcony?
(I know it looks like I have everything)
If I can't have you then they can't have me
(Honestly)

I know they think that I had everything
If I can't have you, then they can't have me
I know it looks like I have everything
If I can't have you, then they can't have me
