You are rolling hard
Santa Monica Boulevard
Black tint glass on your cherry-red car
You know very well no one's bad as you are

You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got

Oh, you look so hot
Your face is like a map of the stars
Your switchblade smile and your battle wound scars
I'm so hot for you, baby, baby
This love is ours

You're still in the game
I want you to change
Stop making it rain
I wanna be your be your girl
Wanna be your girl

You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got

Oh, you look like art
Shining like a star in the dark
Lightning strikes, you're my infinite spark
Set the world on fire and it's lovely to watch

They're scared of your name
They know you're insane
I like it that way
I have to be your girl
I gotta be your girl

You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
You shot, shot, shot, shot, shot
An arrow through my heart now I want you a lot

Life is like, like a little game
That we like to play
Just for fun, just for fun
'Cause we take nothing seriously
Nothings wrong, nothings wrong, oh
Life is like, like a piece of cake
'Cause we love to play
Just for fun, in the sun
Yeah we know nothing means a thing cause
We have won, boy we won, won, won, won, won, won, won

Oh be still my heart
You're shining like a light in the dark

You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got

You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
