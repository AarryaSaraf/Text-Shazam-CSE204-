I only put you in a box, cause you're giving me a head rush
I only want your love, I want your love, want your love
I'm a lion in a party dress, I won't stop until I get the best
Yeah-yea-yea-yeah

Everybody knows they call me Brooklyn baby
Everyone's one true love on the side
(Love on the side, love on the side)
Everybody knows I'm American, baby
Watching me dance while you get h-high
(Get h-high, get h-high)
Everybody knows they call me trouble, baby
One of us comes from the white trash side
(White trash side, white trash side)
I'm everything you want but it's hard to decide
Cause everybody wants true love on the side
(Love on the side, love on the side)
Yeah-yea-yea-yeah
