He don't like no small things
Even riding 'round on tall dreams
I don't wanna go
He's a sweet baby, but he looks mean
In his soft leather and his blue jeans

He got a way, oh, baby, he got a way, oh, baby
He got a way with his words
They be like diamonds and pearls
They be like diamonds and pearls
He gives to his little favorite girls

I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

He don't like no spotlight
Stands real quiet in the moonlight

He got a way, oh, baby, he got a way, mm, baby
He got a way with those words
They be like diamonds and pearls
They be like diamonds and pearls
He gives to his little favorite girls

I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

Loving you isn't right
Black leather moonlight (I give in)
Loving you isn't right
It's original sin

I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

I feel like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Like I can do anything that I like
I feel like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Tonight
Baby, tonight
Tonight
