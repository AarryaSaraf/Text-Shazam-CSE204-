My, my, apple of my eye
I think you're really hot
And I want you to be mine
I like the way the bling on your pinky ring shine
Ay, ay, ay

I will blow them all away

I'm in South Beach
In my white tee
I see this bad thing
I think she like me
He's from South Beach
In his white tee
Said that I could
Be his wifey

My, my, think you're really fly
Don't look at all the other girls
Bye bye
Kiss me really hard baby
Hold me really tight
Ay, ay, ay

I'm free and I'm fresh and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be and I want, want you boy
I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

I'm delicious
You can't touch this
I'm that bitch that
You can't fuck with
She's delicious
I'm 'a cuff it
She that bitch that
I wanna fuck with
