Carry me off the stage
I can't do this anymore
Been gone for 3 years
Is that enough for you boy?

Carry me to my bed, paint my toe nails blue
Tell me all about the things that you and I will never do

I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah

Carry me off the stage
Had too much to drink
Been on tour too long
And I've had too much time to think

Carry me to my bed
Lay me in a pillow town
Kiss me on my head
And remind me of the way we will not know

I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah

Late at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, laying in Versailles
You and I get to know one another

Late at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, baby you and I
Can get to know one another

Cause late at night, we have one life to kill
Oh you and I
Can get to know the thrill
Cause baby you're my sign
And I wanna get to know ya

I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah

(Ah)
(Ah)
(Ah)
