Down, down, down
Mm, uh-huh
Huh, let's go!

When you got her in the back seat
Driving round the back streets
Trying to block me out
(Do you remember my name?)
Cruising down Santa Monica Boulevard
Does it light up the spark?
(Do you remember my name?)

Is she your ride-or-die bitch
Does she know I'm tattooed onto your heart?
You can try to fight it
I have left my mark on you
There is nothing you can do

When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real-life suicide blonde
(You like that?)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

When you take her to Chateau Marmont
'Cause you booked the top suite
Lay her on the bed
(Do you remember my name?)
Strip her down to her bare ass
In her Kiki de Montparnasse
Like I used to have
(Do you remember my name?)

Is she your ride-or-die bitch
Does she make you shiver under your skin
Just the way that I did?
It won't be the same again
She don't compare to who I am

When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real-life suicide blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

You try to forget and you tell her that you miss her
But I bet every time you go to kiss her
You get a hot rush feeling on your lips
It's me taking over you, throwing you a curve ball
Reminding you of our true romance and
Just like the first time you learned to dance and
I showed you all those moves she can't do
She's not me (me, me)

When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real-life suicide blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me
When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real-life suicide blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me
