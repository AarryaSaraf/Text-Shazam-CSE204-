One, two
One, two

I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
What the fuck happened here?
I guess what they meant when
They paid the price
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
Where are the trailer parks?
And where all the Christmas lights?

I had a boyfriend
He came from this town
We used to pretend we were married and start again
He read the Bible
Showed me what Jesus said
He said I should rewrite (He only read the red)

I want Jesus to take me out this life, baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
Nothing looks familiar here
No one even that I like
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
I was so much happier when I was gonna be your wife

We had a deal and
I fucked it up when
I made the decision to become someone
We had the one thing that no one ever had
True love
It's true love

I ask Jesus to take me out this life baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

I never meant to hurt you baby
It's so hard to be true
In this world where everything's so black and blue
I never meant to hurt you darling
It's so hard to be good
In this world where you do what you know you shouldn't

I want Jesus to take me out this life baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me
