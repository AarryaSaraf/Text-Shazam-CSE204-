You were the freak king of the piercing shop
All the girls thought they could sing
But they're really not, shit, I don't get it
You're looking like a man, you're talking like a baby
How the fuck is your song in a Coke commercial? Crazy
I don't get it, your taste once exquisite

What happened to Brooklyn?
What happened to New York?
What happened to my scene?
What happened to punk rock, rock?

You called me the queen of the downtown scene, babe
How the fuck would you go switch it up and then replace me?
I don't get it, I'm so legit

Tell me, was it 'cause I wasn't platinum in jewels?
That perhaps, you thought I was a little bit of an uncool
Kid, was that it?

Stefani, you suck, I know you're selling twenty million
Wish they could have seen you when we booed you off in Williamsburg
You're hurt, I know my words don't hurt ya

Oh, girl, I see you walking 'round in your pearls
Thinking that you're number one
You're so funny, 'cause honey, you're not

What happened to Brooklyn, the last frontier?
They said you could make it anywhere if you can make it here
But where?
No magic in the air

What happened to Brooklyn?
What happened to our scene, baby?
Have we all gone Gaga crazy?
Remember when the streets used to be dangerous
And we were born bad?
And we were born bad?

Punk rock, punk rock
The boys used to punch each other in the face
And girls were walking 'round wasted
Everyone had a good night, come back in sunlight
Punk rock, rock, rock
