I don't really wanna die
I just want the pain to be over
I know that I talked about it all the time, babe
Just wanted you to come over
I got tired of America
It got hard to just stay sober
Then I met you and you blew my mind
That was it, game over

We could get lost in the purple rain
Talk about the good old days
I could get drunk on some pink champagne
Lost in the purple haze

Let me love me like you a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be your one time beauty queen
You don't know the world like I do
You don't know how good our love can be
Let me love me like you a woman
Let me take you to infinity
Baby, take you to infinity
Baby

I don't really wanna fly
I just want this tour to be over
I know that I dreamed about it all my life
Then the dream got closer
I miss the smell of America
Green palms, green clover
I can still feel it when I close my eyes
It comes right over

We could get lost in the purple mist
Think about the good old times
Let it come down like the ocean wave
Hold your body in my mind

Let me love me like you a woman
Let me love you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be your one time beauty queen

You don't know the world like I do
You don't know how good people can be
Let me love me like you a woman
Let me take you to infinity
Baby, take you to infinity
Baby

I n-n-n-need you
Don't, don't fucking leave yet
I need, n-n-n-need you
Don't fu-, don't fucking leave yet

Let me love me like you a woman
Let me love you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be your one time beauty queen

You don't know the world like I do
You don't know how good people can be
Let me love me like you a woman
Let me love you like a baby
Baby, take you to infinity
Baby, take you to infinity

Baby, get drunk on some pink champagne
Get lost in the purple haze
