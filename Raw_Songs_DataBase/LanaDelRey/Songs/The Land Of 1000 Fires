Two blue steel trains run through the tunnels of your cool blue steel eyes
Vernon
Rock quarry
The vastness of which has nothing on your beautiful mind
Dylan
I hear Dylan when I look at you
I can see it in invisible ink like a tattoo
The ying to my yang
The toughness to my unending softness
A striking example of masculinity
Firm in your verticality
Sure in your confrontation against all elements
And duality
The sun to my wilting daisy
The earth to the wildflower that doesn't care where it grows

Vernon
Everything's burnt here
There's no escaping it
The air is fried and on fire
I've never really fallen in love
But whatever this feeling is
I wish everyone could experience it
This place feels like a person
Familiar
Like someone I've stood next to before
But never while I was standing next to you
Thank you
For being here
For bearing witness to my vastness

Through the year I've called you in and out of my orbit
You, in your madness
The satellite that constellates my world
Mimicking the inner chaos that I've disowned
A mirror to my past life retributions
And a reflection of my sadness
If I'm going to keep on living the way that I'm living
I can't do it without you
My feet aren't on the ground
I need your body to stand on
Your name to define me
On top of being a woman
I am scared
And
Ethereal
And

There are seven worlds in my eyes

I'm accessing of all them once

One to draw my words from and my muses
Another one I try and harness late at night that lies somewhere
Off of the right of Jupiter
And then of course there's this one I live in
The land of a thousand fires
That's where you come in

You
Vernon
Dylan
Two blue steel trains
Running through the tunnels of your
Cool blue steel eyes

To guide me far from the world of my early days
That I can't quite make out clearly
That beckon me towards high sea cliffs
On long car rides

Towards a future place
A world unknown to me
Made up of something surreal and dripping
Flowers in solar systems oversized

You Vernon Dylan

No words needed to sponge up the
Dark nights
No explanations for the globes in my eyes
Shoulder to shoulder in the factory light
Letting me be who I would have been
If everything had turned out alright

Three alternative endings
Now course through my blood on ice
But I thrive because I say I do
And because it's what I write

But honestly if you weren't here with me
I don't know what things would look like

That's my why no matter what world I'm in
I'm accessible by only one satellite
Vernon
Dylan
And you in your madness

With two blue steel trains running
Through your cool blue steel eyes
