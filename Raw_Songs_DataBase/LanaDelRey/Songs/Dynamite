French vanilla ice cream
Just the way I like
Dripping on your windscreen
I can't get a bite
Guess we could be more than friends
'Cause this kiss won't end
And you got me trembling

You're dynamite
I'm ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You're dynamite
I'm ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you're a wild thing
Rocking on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you're dynamite

Speeding through the wasteland
Sparkling in the lights
Roll up to the boardwalk
Derelict delight
Eyes all on my dress again
I know how this ends
Boy, you're all adrenaline

You're dynamite
I'm ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You're dynamite
I'm ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you're a wild thing
Rocking on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you're dynamite

He's not like other guys
I can't apologize
For what my body wants
And what my heart decides
O-oh
'Cause I'm so close to the real thing
Yeah, I'm so close to the real thing
I'm so close to the real thing
I could almost die

Say it isn't over
Say it's not goodnight
Maybe we could go somewhere
Start a pillow fight

You're dynamite
I'm ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You're dynamite
I'm ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you're a wild thing
Rocking on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you're dynamite
You're dynamite
I'm ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You're dynamite
I'm ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you're a wild thing
Rocking on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you're dynamite
