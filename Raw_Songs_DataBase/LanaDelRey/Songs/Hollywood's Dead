Our kind of love
It was once in a lifetime
It couldn't last
It was doomed from the first time
And you
Were '50s cool
In blue suede shoes
But it was a cover for all of the trouble
You got into

I always fall for the wrong guy
Things that are bad always taste nice
That's what girls like me do, lose you

Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Vicious in flames
Roland is dying
And in the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful

This kind of life
Wasn't meant for the good girl
Try as I might
In the end, it's a cruel world
And you
Are living proof
Sinatra aloof
But you were an actor who only went after
The ones who swooned

I always fall for the same type
Gangsters in Vegas on game night
That's what girls like me like, the limelight

Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Marilyn's sad
Hendrix is lying there
In the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful

If you should go before me, then know
That I always loved you
There's no one above you, babe

Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Lennon, wake up
Cobain, stop lying there
In the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodnight, you're so beautiful

Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead, yeah
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead, yeah
Cut
