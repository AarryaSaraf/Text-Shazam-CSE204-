Ooh-ooh baby, can't you hear our favorite song?
Ooh-ooh baby, make me wait a bit too long
I don't ever want to stop, show me everything you got
I've done this before, and I should know better
Ooh-ooh baby, what planet are you on?
What ya waiting for? What ya waiting for?

Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Say you wanna put your hands on me?
Did you say that there's a chance for me?
Are you ready now?
Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Should be taking off your pants for me
Are you ready for me, finally?
Are you ready now?

Ooh-ooh baby, look at all your high-brow friends
Ooh-ooh baby thinking I don't understand
'Cause I'm drinking diet coke a lot, sucking on my lollipops
I know that I'm not that grown up, but no one's better
Ooh-ooh baby, when you gonna be my man?
What ya waiting for? What ya waiting for?

Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Say you wanna put your hands on me?
Did you say that there's a chance for me?
Are you ready now?
Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Should be taking off your pants for me
Are you ready for me, finally?
Are you ready now?

Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Say you wanna put your hands on me?
Did you say that there's a chance for me?
Are you ready now?

You tell me that you love me
I know you do, I know you do
It doesn't matter what they say, it's true

Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Wanna put your hands on me?
Say that there's a chance for me?
Are you ready now?
Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Should be taking off your pants for me
Are you ready for me finally?
Are you ready now?

Did you say you wanna dance with me?
