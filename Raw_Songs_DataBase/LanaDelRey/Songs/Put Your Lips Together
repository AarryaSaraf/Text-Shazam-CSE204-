You know how to whistle, don't ya?
Just put your lips together
Just put your lips together
And blow, and blow, and blow

You can be a pop princess, put you in a party dress
You can make your smile white
You can party up all night
And you can take your jazz galore-lore, I ain't going anymore
You strike me as the type of guy
Who doesn't know what he's looking for
You say that you're gangster in that the whole world's against ya
I can be your liaison to all things fine

If you wanna win, let me in, let me in
Everybody knows I'm a lucky dice, lucky roll
If you want me back, just put your lips together and blow

You know how to whistle, don't ya?
Just blow, just blow
You know how to whistle, don't ya?
You know who's the most fun, don't ya?
It's me, baby, it's me, baby
Just put your lips together and blow, blow

I can be your dirty bitch, bitch
I can be your only wish
Don't you think it's time to switch
Switch it up, baby, please?
'Cause you're doing the same thing, you'll get the same thing
Don't you want better? You was a smart boy
Don't you want heaven?
Don't you want heaven here on earth?

If you wanna win, let me in, let me in
If you want me back, all you have to do is sin
Put your lips together, put your lips together

You know how to whistle, don't ya?
Put your lips together, won't ya?
And blow, and blow-oh-oh
You know how to whistle, don't ya?
You know who's the most fun, don't ya?
It's me, baby
Put your lips together, put your lips together

I'm hot, hot, don't stop
It's what I want, want you, babe, you, babe
I, I, I, I blow hard, don't stop, stop, stop
It's all I really want, it's all I really want, it's you, you

You know how to whistle, don't ya?
You know who's the most fun, don't ya?
Don't ya know, babe?
Just put your lips together and blow

If you wanna win, let me in, let me in
If you want me back, all you have to do is sin
Put your lips together and blow
Let me in, if you

If you wanna win, let me in, let me in
