Disco
GoGo dancer so rare
Move down, up slow
Prostitute stare
I do what I like
I just don't care

I am my only god
I am my only god
I am my only god
Now

Black eyes
Short dress
Let's break it down
You shoot and I pose
Polaroid frown
I'll do what you like
I won't make a sound

I am my only god
I am my only god
I am my only god
Now

Icon
Young star
Heroin fiend
Just sit and I'll sing
I'll be your queen
You know how I like
That celebrity type
Poor me

I am my only god
I am my only god
I am my only god
Now
