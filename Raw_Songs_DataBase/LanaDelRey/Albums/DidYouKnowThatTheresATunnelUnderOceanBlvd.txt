// The Grants //

One, two, ready
I'm gonna take mine with you with me
Ah, "Mine," say it again
"Mine of you with me," thank you
One more time
One, two, ready
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
Like "Rocky Mountain High"
The way John Denver sings

So you say there's a chance for us?
Should I do a dance for once?
You're a family man, but
But

Do you think about Heaven? Oh-oh
Do you think about me?
My pastor told me
"When you leave, all you take
Uh-huh, is your memories"

And I'm gonna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me

So many mountains too high to climb
So many rivers, so long, but I'm
Doin' the hard stuff, I'm doin' my time
I'm doin' it for us, for our family line

Do you think about Heaven? Oh-oh
Do you think about me?
My pastor told me (I'll do it, I'll do it)
"When you leave, all you take (I did it, I did it)
Uh-huh, is your memories"

And I wanna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
Yeah, I'm gonna take mine of you with me
Like "Rocky Mountain High," the way John Denver sings

My sister's first-born child
I'm gonna take that too with me
My grandmother's last smile
I'm gonna take that too with me
It's a beautiful life
Remember that too for me

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah

// Did You Know That There's A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd //

Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd
Mosaic ceilings, painted tiles on the wall
I can't help but feel someone like my body marred my soul
Handmade beauty, sealed up by two man-made walls
And I'm like

When's it gonna be my turn?
When's it gonna be my turn?
Open me up, tell me you like it
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd

There's a girl that sings Hotel California
Not because she loves the notes or sounds, the sound that floated out
It's because she's in a world preserved, only a few have found the door
It's like Camarillo, only silver mirrors running down the corridor
Oh, man

When's it gonna be my turn?
Don't forget me
When's it gonna be my turn?
Open me up, tell me you like me
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd
Don't forget me
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd

Harry Nilsson has a song, his voice breaks at 2:05
Something about the way he says, "Don't forget me"
Makes me feel like
I just wish I had a friend like him, someone to give me fire
Leaning in my back, whispering in my ear
"Come on, baby, you can drive"
But I can't

When's it gonna be my turn?
Don't forget me
When's it gonna be my turn?
Open me up, tell me you like it
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd

Don't forget me
At the tunnel under Ocean Blvd
Don't forget me
At the tunnel under Ocean Blvd
Don't forget me
At the tunnel under Ocean Blvd

Don't forget me, don't forget me
No, no, no, don't forget me
Don't you, don't you forget me (No, oh)

// Sweet //

Stars in my eyes, hiking up Griffith
Thinking about who was sad and what didn't
Get said in the Midwest, wish I could tell you now
I wrote you a note, but I didn't send it
'Cause that's the best method the women here taught me about
What you don't really understand
I've got magic in my hand, stars in my eyes

I'm a different kind of woman
If you want some basic bitch go to the Beverly Center and find her
I'm sweet
Bare feet
If you wanna go where nobody goes
That's where you'll find me
In the sweet north country
If I'm not there, come to my house on Genesee

What you doing with your life? Do you think about it?
Do you contemplate where we came from?
Lately, we've been making out a lot
Not talking 'bout the stuff that's at the very heart of things
Do you want children? Do you wanna marry me?
Do you wanna run marathons in Long Beach by the sea?
I've got things to do like nothing at all
I wanna do them with you, do you wanna do them with me?

If you want someone, then just call me up
And remember where I'll be
Sweet and bare feet
You can find me where no one will be
In the woods somewhere, in the night
In the heart of a valley
In the sweet north country
If I'm not there, come to my house on Genesee

// A&W //

I haven't done a cartwheel since I was nine
I haven't seen my mother in a long, long time
I mean, look at me
Look at the length of my hair, and my face, the shape of my body
Do you really think I give a damn
What I do after years of just hearing them talking?

I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter

Call him up, "Come into my bedroom"
Ended up, we fuck on the hotel floor
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
This is the experience of bein' an American whore

Called up one drunk, called up another
Forensic Files wasn't on
Watching Teenage Diary of a Girl
Wondering what went wrong
I'm a princess, I'm divisive
Ask me why, why, why I'm like this
Maybe I'm just kinda like this
I don't know, maybe I'm just like this

I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter

Call him up, he comes over again
Yeah, I know I'm over my head but, oh
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore

I mean look at my hair
Look at the length of it and the shape of my body
If I told you that I was raped
Do you really think that anybody would think
I didn't ask for it? I didn't ask for it
I won't testify, I already fucked up my story
On top of this (Mm), so many other things you can't believe
Did you know a singer can still be
Looking like a sidepiece at thirty-three?
God's a charlatan, don't look back, babe
Puts the shower on while he calls me
Slips out the back door to talk to me
I'm invisible, look how you hold me
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'm a ghost now, look how you hold me now

It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore (Oh, okay)
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore

This is the experience of bein' an American whore
This is the experience of bein' an American whore
This is the experience of bein' an American whore
Woo

Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, Jimmy, ride
Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, get me high (Oh my god)

Jimmy, if you leave the house, find me in the club (Like)
Jimmy, if you switch it up, you should light it up
Jimmy, if you leave the house, find me in the club (Like, surf's up)
Your mom called, I told her, you're fuckin' up big time
But I don't care, baby, I already lost my mind
Jimmy, if I lie it up, find me in the club (Mind, mind)
Your mom called, I told her, you're fucking up big time

Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, Jimmy, ride
Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, get me high
Love me if you love or not, you can be my light
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Your mom called, I told her, you're fuckin' up big time

// Judah Smith Interlude //

I don't understand what that means
It means quit lusting after your neighbor
That's a heck of a life
You get to love your children in front of you
You get to love, you have to talk to somebody "I want a new life"
"I don't love my wife anymore, I don't love my kids anymore
Missing out on life at usually my age"
Does that sound like love?
It's a life dominated with lust
And for too long, they've been holding it up
And finally, they just get weak and they say
"It doesn't matter anymore"
And the Spirit of God says, "I'll infuse you with desires for what you have and what's in front of you."
(Yeah, yeah)

So, as it works deep in your heart
As you call out to Him and say, "How could you do it to me, Man?"
Help me want what I got. Help me love what's in front of me
Help me want more of my wife and more of my friends
And help me serve the city I live in
And not wish it away and hope I can move
Help me, God
I wanna be a man in love, not a man in lust."
But you've gotta do that
So I bring you to this verse, then I'm done, I'm done
Psalms, chapter 8

And do you know where I got this verse?
This is gonna sound crazy to you, but I'm gonna tell you the absolute truth
It's gonna make me sound so superior to us all
I'm looking forward to it
I woke up this morning and God said, "Check the Bible"
I don't know if it was God, but if felt like God in my head
I thought if I hadn't checked the Bible
I'm gonna speak to you from the verse of the day
That means I don't have to do anything, I don't have to look anywhere
Just get to the verse of the day
So I get to the verse of the day and here's the verse of the day
Today, in the Bible

Look at this (It's cool)
Look at the splendor of the skies
You creative genius glowing in the heavens
When I gaze, when I gaze at Your moon and Your stars
Mounted like jewels in their setting
I know, You are the fascinating artist who fashioned it all
When I look up and I see such wonder and workmanship above
I have to ask this question
I've gotta ask this question
Compared to all this cosmic glory
Why would you ever bother with puny, mortal men
Or be—ooh, don't get me started, I could preach another hour—be infatuated
Totally infatuated with Adam's son?

Why are you so infatuated with me?
You're the star creator, You're the ocean maker (Yeah, yeah)
You're the whale creator, you're the rhino designer
Who, who are you? (Rhino designer)
And then, and then it goes on in verse 5
And it says, "Yet what honor you have given to men
Created only a little lower than Elohim
Which is the name of Creator God
Artist God"
You wanna call God "artist"
At some point tonight when you go to bed pray
"Yo, Elohim," and he'll hear, "You're the best artist ever"

Crowned like kings and queens with glory and magnificence
You have delighted, You delegated to them mastery over all You have made
You've made me a partner with You
I used to think my preaching was mostly about you
And you're not gonna like this but I'm gonna to tell You the truth
I've discovered my preaching is mostly about me

// Candy Necklace //

White flowers, cinnamon on my teeth
And I'm sittin' at a stoplight in northern town
I feel lucky
I drive somewhere out of range, I don't know where
White noise coming out of my brain
Turns off for nothing

Rockefella, my umbrella
God, I love you, baby
Storyteller, us forever
Is my favorite song

You've been acting pretty restless
Dancin' like the young and restless
And I'm obsessed with it
Candy necklaces
You've been acting pretty reckless
Dancing like the young and restless
And I'm obsessed with this
All his candy necklaces

Sittin' on the sofa, feelin' super suicidal
Hate to say the word, but, baby, hand on the Bible
I do feel like it's you the one who's bringing me down
Thought that we were cool, we were kicking it like Tribe Called Quest
You're the best, but, baby, you've been bringing me down
I can see it now

Rockafella, my umbrella
God I love you, baby
Fortune teller, favorite ever
Was the story of us

You've been acting pretty restless
Dancin' like the young and reckless
And I'm obsessed with this
Candy necklaces
I think that we should address this
Acting like the young and restless
I'm obsessed with this
All his candy necklaces

We've been acting pretty restless
Dancin' like the young and restless
I'm obsessed with this
Candy necklaces

Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces (Mm)
Candy necklaces (Mhm)
Candy necklaces (I'm obsessed with this)
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces ('Cause I'm obsessed with this)
Candy necklaces (Mm)
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces, oh

// Jon Batiste Interlude //

Oh

I feel it early, I feel it
I feel it early
Woo, woohoo
I feel it early and I feel it late
Oh, my goodness
Yeah, I feel it

Ah, ooh

Early in the morning

// Kintsugi //

There's a certain point the body can't come back from
In one year, we've learned the turn of the mouth
The depth that the chest cavity takes
Chucky was there for three out of three
I was there for the third 'cause I couldn't be
There for the one who was closest to me
But I can't say I'd run when things get hard
It's just that I don't trust myself with my heart
But I've had to let it break a little more
'Cause they say that's what it's for

That's how the light shines in
That's how the light shines in
That's how the light gets in

So everyone was there, they were standing and laughing
And I'm on the side with my tears streaming down
There's something about the clutch of the wrist
He thought mine was his to carve into his mouth
We've only got hours
And I just can't stop crying 'cause all of the ways
When you see someone dying
You see all your days flash in front of you
And you think about who would be with you
And then there's Donoghue

Daddy, I miss them
I'm in the mountains
I'm probably running away from the feelings I get
When I think of all the things about them
Daddy, I miss them
I'm at the Roadrunner Café
I'm probably running away from the thoughts in the day
I had things to do with them, but they say

That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in

Think by the 3rd of March, I was cracked open
Finally the ground was cold, they wouldn't open
Brought by the sunlight of the spirit to pour into rain
There's a name for it in Japanese, it's kintsugi
They sang folk songs from the '40s
Even the fourteen-year old knew "Froggie Came A-Courtin'"
How do my blood relatives know all of these songs?
I don't know anyone left to know songs that I sing

That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in

But daddy, I miss them
I'm at the Roadrunner Café
Probably running away from the feelings today
In the snow-capped mountains of the desert
Daddy, I miss them
I'm in the mountains
Probably running away, I've been meaning to say
That there's nothing to do except know that this is

How the light gets in
Like the cracking, the light gets in
It's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
Then you're golden
Ah, ah, ah
Just another folk song, but anyway
I try so hard, but that's okay
It's how the light gets in
It's how the light gets in
It's how the light gets in

// Fingertips //

When I look back, tracing fingertips over plastic bags
Thinking, "I wish I could extrapolate some small intention
Or maybe just get your attention for a minute or two"

Will I die? Or will I get to that ten-year mark?
Where I beat the extinction of telomeres?
And if I do, will you be there with me, Father, Sister, Brother?

Charlie, stop smoking
Caroline, will you be with me?
Will the baby be alright?
Will I have one of mine?
Can I handle it
Even if I do?
You said that I might
It's not fair or so they said
To carry a child
I guess I'll be fine

It wasn't my idea the cocktail of things that twist neurons inside
But without them, I'd die
They say there's irony in the music, it's a tragedy
I see nothing Greek in it
Give me a mausoleum in Rhode Island with Dad, Grandma, Grandpa and Dave
Who hung himself real high
In the National Park sky, it's a shame and I'm crying right now
To get to you, save you if I take my life
Find your astral body, put it into my eyes
Give you two seconds to cry
Take you home, I, I'll give you a blanket
Your spirit can sit and watch TV by my side
'Cause, baby, I ran through a time when I felt you were doing it

I couldn't handle it, I was in Monaco
I couldn't hear what they said on the telephone
I had to sing for the prince in two hours
Sat in the shower
Gave myself two seconds to cry
It's a shame that we die

When I was fifteen, naked, next-door neighbors did a drive-by
Pulled me up by my waist, long hair to the beach side
I wanted to go out like you, swim with the fishes
That he caught on Rhode Island beaches
But, sometimes, it's just not your time

Caroline, what kind of mother was she to say I'd end up in institutions?
All I wanted to do was kiss Aaron Greene and sit by the lake
Twisting lime into the drinks that they made
Have a babe at sixteen, the town I was born in and died

Aaron ended up dead and not me
What the fuck's wrong in your head to send me away never to come back
Exotic places and people to take the place of being your child?
I give myself two seconds to cry
Let it crash over me like
The waves in the sea
Call me Aphrodite
As they bow down to me

Sunbather, moon chaser, queen of empathy
I give myself two seconds to breathe
And go back to being a serene queen
I just needed two seconds to be me

// Paris, Texas //

I went to Paris (Texas)
With a suitcase in my hand
I had to leave
Knew they wouldn't understand

When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It's time, it's time to go
When you know, you know
Then the more you know
It's time to go

I took a trip to Spain
Just a notebook in my hand
Then I went to see some friends of mine
Down in Florence, Alabama

When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It's time, it's time to go
When you know, you know
That it's time to leave
Like the summer breeze

When everyone star's bright
Brighter than you are
It's time to go
And you're the only one left
Dancin' while they're on the floor
Time to go

I flew back home
It seems everything's the same (Venice, California)
Except that you aren't home
Hello, I call to know why (But)

When you're home, you're home (Venice, California)
When you're home, you're home (Venice, California)
When you're home, when you're alone
When you're right, you're right
When you're right, you're right
Even when you're wrong

// Grandfather Please Stand On The Shoulders Of My Father While He's Deep-Sea Fishing //

Three white butterflies to know you're near

I know they think, that it took somebody else
To make me beautiful (Beautiful)
As they intended me to be
But they're wrong
I know they think
That it took thousands of people
To put me together again
Like an experiment
Some big men behind the scenes
Sewing Frankenstein black dreams into my songs
But they're wrong

God, if you're near me send me three white butterflies
Or an owl to know you're listening, sitting while I'm drinking
Grandfather, please stand on the shoulders of my father
While he's deep-sea fishing for sharks in the Pacific
'Cause I'm good on spirit, warm-bodied
A fallible deity wrapped up in white
I'm folk, I'm jazz, I'm blue, I'm green
Regrettably, also a white woman

But I have good intentions even if I'm one of the last ones
If you don't believe me, my poetry or my melodies
Feel it in your bones
I have good intentions even if I'm one of the last ones
(Ah-ha-ah, yeah, ah-ha-ah, yeah, ah-ha-ah, yeah)

Grandfather, please stand on the shoulders of my father
While he's deep-sea fishing for all the things he's wishing
God, if you're near me, send me three white butterflies
Or a map to know Your vision, impart on me Your wisdom

It took somebody else to make me beautiful
Wonderful
As they intended me to be
But they're wrong

Three white butterflies to know you're near

// Let The Light In //

[Lana Del Rey:]
Pick you up at home, quarter to three
Ask you if you want somethin' to eat
Drive around, get drunk, do it over again
Wake you up at night, quarter to one
I can never stop, wanna have fun
Don't be actin' like I'm the kinda girl who can sleep

'Cause every time you say you're gonna go
I just smile 'cause babe, I already know
You know I got nothin' under this overcoat

[Lana Del Rey & Father John Misty:]
Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and I, back at it again

[Lana Del Rey:]
Pick you up around quarter to two
Usually we got nothin' to do
Screw it, maybe you should go and record some other songs
Got my dress on tight 'cause you know that I
Look shinin' in the light, there's so much ridin'
On this life and how we write a love song

[Lana Del Rey & Father John Misty:]
Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and I back at it again

[Lana Del Rey:]
'Cause I love to love, to love, to love, to love you
I hate to hate, to hate, to hate you
Put the Beatles on, light the candles, go back to bed
'Cause I wanna, wanna, wanna want you
I need to, need to, need to need you
Put the TV on, flowers in a vase, lie your head

[Lana Del Rey & Father John Misty:]
Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and me back at it again

// Margaret //

[Lana Del Rey:]
This is a simple song, I'm gonna write it for a friend
My shirt is inside out, I'm messy with the pen
He met Margaret on a rooftop, she was wearing white
And he was like, "I might be in trouble"
He had flashes of the good life, he was like
"Should I jump off this building now or do it on the double?"

[Lana Del Rey & Jack Antonoff:]
'Cause, baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble

When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It kinda makes me laugh, running down that path
When you're good, it's gold
'Cause when you know, you know

[Jack Antonoff:]
A word to all my friends
But there are red flags, they are not nice
There are black eyes and there are blue eyes
If you're asking yourself, "How do you know?"
Then that's your answer, the answer is "No"
Yeah, gotta run, gotta run around like your head's on fire
Run away like your head is on fire

[Lana Del Rey & Jack Antonoff:]
'Cause, baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble

[Lana Del Rey & Jack Antonoff, Lana Del Rey:]
When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It kinda makes me laugh, running down that path
When you're good, it's gold
'Cause when you know, you know
When you're old, you're old
Like Hollywood in me, the diamond on your ring
The soul that you bring to the table
One that makes me see, eeh-eeh-eeh
In a minor key
'Cause when you know, you know
When you know, you know

[Lana Del Rey:]
So, if you don't know
Don't give up
'Cause you never know what the new day might bring

[Lana Del Rey & Jack Antonoff:]
Maybe tomorrow you'll know
Maybe tomorrow you'll know
Maybe tomorrow you'll know

[Lana Del Rey:]
I mean, join the party
By the way, the party is December 18
(Okay, let's waltz this out, 'cause)

[Lana Del Rey & Jack Antonoff:]
'Cause when you know, you know
When you're old, you're old
Like Hollywood in me, that diamond on your ring
The soul that you bring to the table

[Lana Del Rey:]
One that makes me see, eeh-eeh-eeh
In a minor key
Diamond on your ring
'Cause when you know, you know
When you know, you know

// Fishtail //

Don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair, babe
If you don't really care
You wanted me sadder, you wanted me sadder
Fishtail is the matter, like that, ah-ah-ah

Skipping rope in the bayou, bayou
Slip softly into rain
Not that smart but I've got things to say
Palm trees in black and white
I like to watch them sway
You're so funny, I wish I could skinny-dip inside your mind
Lately I've been thinking about how things used to be
Swinging in a nightgown underneath the old oak tree
Almost Victorian with you, you can talk to me
But lately, I can't see

You wanted me sadder
You wanted me sadder
Baby, can't you see it?
(You wanted me sadder)
For me, you are the one
And if I'm not the one for you
Don't you see it?
I was on the stairs
Ella Fitzgerald in the air
Feelin' hella rare
Baby, if you care
Baby, don't you dare say
You'll braid my hair, babe
Don't you dare say
That you'll braid my hair
Babe, if you don't really care
You wanted me sadder

Dancing there in the hot out sun
I know that we've got problems
I plan to address them another day
Palm trees in black and white
I see in Technicolor
Maybe I'll take my glasses off so I'll stop painting red flags green
Lately I've been sunning in the L.A. river bed
Wearing nothing but the summer bruises on my knees
I like how you talk, how you speak, how you look at me
But lately, I can't see

You wanted me sadder
Baby, can't you see it?
(You wanted me sadder)
For me, you are the one
If I'm not the one for you
Don't just see it?
I was on the stairs
Ella Fitzgerald in the air
Feelin' hella rare
Baby, if you care
Baby, don't you dare say
You'll braid my hair
See, baby, if you care
Then, baby, don't you dare say
(Don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair, see)
That you really care
Don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair
When you get home tonight
If you don't really care
Yeah, don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair, babe
If don't really care, see
Don't you care say that you'll braid my hair if you're not coming home to me
Hmm-mm

You want someone sadder
Skipping rope in the bayou, bayou
Slip softly into rain
I'm not that smart
But I've got things to say

// Peppers //

[Tommy Genesis:]
Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Lemme put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss cross in the back somewhere, ha

[Lana Del Rey:]
Me and my boyfriend listen to the Chili Peppers
We write hit songs without trying like all the time, all the time
I take off all my clothes, dance naked for the neighbors
I'm like, "Fuck it, gonna give a show", I open up the blinds

I threw caution to the wind, get on to the bike
Take a minute to yourself, skinny dip in my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love
Got a knife in my jacket, honey, I'm divine
Baby, I'll bring the coffee if you bring the wine
I'm in love, I'm in love
Ah

[Tommy Genesis:]
Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Lemme put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss cross in the back somewhere, ha
Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Lemme put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss cross in the back somewhere, ha

[Lana Del Rey:]
I sit upskirt, I don't have much to lose
I got a truck, I take it for a midnight, a midnight drive, yeah
My boyfriend tested positive for COV-, it don't matter
We've been kissing, so whatever he has, I have
I can't cry

I threw caution to the wind, get on to the bike
Take a minute for myself, skinny dip in my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love
Ah

[Tommy Genesis:]
Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Lemme put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss cross in the back somewhere, ha

[Lana Del Rey:]

// Taco Truck x VB //

Met my boyfriend down at the taco truck
Pass me my vape, I'm feeling sick, I need to take a puff
Imagine if we actually gave a fuck
Wouldn't that be something to talk about for us?
Caribbean blue in sweater weather, I'm falling into you
Although it seems I've gotten better, I can be violent too

That's why they call me Lanita
When I get down I'm bonita
Don't come find me in Reseda
I'll go crazy
Read my gold chain, says, "Lanita"
When I'm violent, it's Carlito's Way
Blood on my feet on the street
I'm dancin' crazy

Spin it 'til you whip it into a cream, baby
Print it to black and white pages don't faze me
Before you talk, let me stop what you're saying
I know, I know, I know that you hate me

Honey, I got up so early
And then, I got into the shower
I was just able to go back to sleep for a hour and a half
So that rocked, um, anyway (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
I had this dream where, um, aha, I don't know
(Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss)

You heard my baby's back in town now
You should come, come over
We'll be hanging around now
You should come, come over
Back, back to the garden
We're getting high now because we're older
Me myself, I like diamonds
Oh baby, crimson and clover

Oh God, I miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice Bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss

(Ah, shatter)
Calling out, bang bang, kiss kiss
(Ah, yeah, ah, shatter)
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss
(Yeah, yeah)

Back in the garden
We're getting high now because we're older
Me myself, I like diamonds
But baby, crimson and clover
Wha-wha-wha-wha-whatever
Everything, whatever
Wha-wha-wha-wha-whatever
Everything's whatever

Oh God, I miss you on my lips (I do, I do)
It's me, your little Venice bitch (Yes, it is)
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss

(Ah, shatter)
Calling out, bang bang, kiss kiss
(Ah, yeah, ah, shatter)
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss
(Yeah, yeah)

If you weren't mine (Get high), I'd be jealous of your love (Drop acid)
If you weren't mine (Never die), I'd be jealous of your love (Not tonight, bang, bang)
If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
(Oh, God, I miss you on my lips)
If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
(On the stoop with the neighborhood kids)
(Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss)
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss
(Yeah)
