// Christmas Town //

It's Christmas Town, Christmas Town
We're up here in the North
Making toys for you until December 24th
We're the elves of Christmas Town
We fill up Santa's sleigh
Making sure that everyone has toys on Christmas day
Making sure that everyone has toys on Christmas day

Tap tap tap the hammer
Ring ring ring the bell
With lots of noise and clamour
For Santa's clientele
A talking doll that dances
A puppet that has strings
A rocking horse that prances
A music box that sings

Oh
It's Christmas Town, Christmas Town
We're up here in the North
Making toys for you until December 24th
We're the elves of Christmas Town
We fill up Santa's sleigh
Making sure that everyone has toys on Christmas day
Making sure that everyone has toys on Christmas day

Pick pick pick the candy
Pack pack pack the train
As elves we're pretty handy
With a car or boat or plane
We've got the list and counting
And checking every name
And though the gifts are mounting
No two will be the same

Oh, it's Christmas Town, Christmas Town
We're up here in the North
Making toys for you until December 24th
We're the elves of Christmas Town
We fill up Santa's sleigh
Making sure that everyone has toys on Christmas day
Making sure that everyone has toys on Christmas day

// It's Raining Men //

Hi - Hi! We're your Weather Girls - Ah-huh -
And have we got news for you - You better listen!
Get ready, all you lonely girls
And leave those umbrellas at home. - Alright! -

Humidity is rising - Barometer's getting low
According to all sources, the street's the place to go
Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half-past ten
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men.

It's Raining Men! Hallelujah! - It's Raining Men! Amen!
I'm gonna go out to run and let myself get
Absolutely soaking wet!
It's Raining Men! Hallelujah!
It's Raining Men! Every Specimen!
Tall, blonde, dark and lean
Rough and tough and strong and mean

God bless Mother Nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel to rearrange the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
It's Raining Men! Hallelujah! - It's Raining Men! Amen!
It's Raining Men! Hallelujah!
It's Raining Men! Ame-nnnn!

I feel stormy weather / Moving in about to begin
Hear the thunder / Don't you lose your head
Rip off the roof and stay in bed

God bless Mother Nature, she's a single woman too
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do
She taught every angel to rearrange the sky
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy
It's Raining Men! Yeah!

Humidity is rising - Barometer's getting low
According to all sources, the street's the place to go
Cause tonight for the first time
Just about half-past ten
For the first time in history
It's gonna start raining men.

It's Raining Men! Hallelujah! - It's Raining Men! Amen!
It's Raining Men! Hallelujah! - It's Raining Men!

// Live Your Life Before You Die //

Time has a desperate way of passing
Even more the thoughts of what's gone by
And there's just no need in asking
Who really knows the reason why
Maybe you're having trouble loving
Your mate can't relate to your tune
You tried to piece it all together
You almost had it, but he left too soon

Just when you think you got things just about licked
Got thing about under control
Up pops that mean old devil with his bag of tricks
Messing up your mind and tearing out your soul

All things happen for a reason
Nothing beats a failure but a try
And as sure as the changing of the seasons
You're gonna live you life before you die

You're gonna live your life
You're gonna live your life
Hey you're gonna live your life before you die

Just when you think you got things just about licked
Got thing about under control
Up pops that mean old devil with his bag of tricks
Messing up your mind and tearing out your soul

All things happen for a reason
God only knows the reason why
And as sure as the changing of the seasons
You're gonna live you life before you die

You're gonna live your life
You're gonna live your life
Hey you're gonna live your life before you die

Before you die' before you die
Before you die' before you die
Before you die' before you die
Before you die, before you die
Before you die, before you die
Before you die' before you die

// We Are Family //

We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

Everyone can see we're together
As we walk on by
And we fly just like birds of a feather
I'm not telling no lie

All of the people around us to say
Can we be that close
Just let me state for the record
We're giving love in a family dose, yeah

[Chorus:]
We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

Living life is fun and we've just begun
To get our share of the world's delights
High hopes we have for the future
And our goal's in sight
No we don't get depressed
Here's what we call our golden rule
Have faith in you and the things you do
You won't go wrong, oh no
This is our family Jewel, yeah

[Chorus:]
We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

// You Gotta Believe //

Doodle wop a-rat-a-tat boom
I'll make the sound of a jet plane zoom
Doodle wop a-rat-a-tat boom
I'll make the sound of a fire

You got to believe in somethin'
Why not believe in me?
You got to believe in somethin'
Why not believe in me?

What have I, I done to you
To make you mean
And treat me the way you do?

Go on and wave your flag, brother
Start your revolution
I'm willin' to let you do your thing
Tell me why are you plannin' a compromise?

Oh, you got to believe in somethin'
Why not believe in me?
You gotta believe in somethin'
Why not believe in me?

Take the chain off your brain
Take the chain off your brain
Stop, take a look at yourself
Stop ridiculin' everybody else

You got to believe in somethin'
Why not believe in me?
You got to believe in somethin'
Why not believe in me?
