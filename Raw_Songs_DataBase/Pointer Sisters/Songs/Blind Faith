Do you remember
Back in '64
You came knocking
Knocking on my door

Yeah, you really got me going
But you kept me on ice
I didn't care where I was going
No, I didn't think twice

I was such a young girl
I was so green
You were so experienced
You know what I mean

Still you really got me going
But you kept me on ice
I didn't care where I was going
No, I didn't think twice

Blind faith was all we had
Looking back it all seemed kinda sad
We just sat around and watched it all go bad

You said I never thanked you
For everything you'd done
Had to do a lot of walking
Before I could run

Still you really got me going
But you kept me on ice
I didn't care where I was going
No, I didn't think twice

Blind faith was all we had
Looking back it all seemed kinda sad, yes it did
We just sat around and watched it all go bad
Oh! Blind faith was all

Yeah yeah

Blind faith was all we had
Looking back it all seemed kinda sad, yes it did
We just sat around and watched it all go bad
Blind faith was all we had
Looking back it all seemed kinda sad
We just sat around and watched it all go bad
