It feels so cold, the world is on hold
Everybody's holding back
Too scared to make a connection
Seems as if we've lost the knack' babe
It's been so long since somebody moved me
Made me lose my self-control
I want the pain and the pleasure
Anything to shake my soul

I can't be satisfied
Doin' it the way it's done
I got this need inside

I gotta feel some real feelin'
Give me some chemistry
Get me a shot of something hot
Oh' somebody set me free
Honey' please set me free

I wanna know the highs and the lows
Tired of living in between
I'll take the heat of the moment
You can keep the old routine, hey
I'm ready for all kinds of emotion
Everything is not too much
I'll buy the risk and the romance
I just wanna feel the rush

I can't be satisfied
Doin' it to someone else
I got this urge inside

I gotta feel some real feelin'
Give me some chemistry
Give me a shot of something hot
Hey, somebody set me free
Oh' I wanna feel the fire burnin'
Wanna live dangerously
Give me a shot of something hot
Oh, somebody set me free, hey
Honey' please set me free, oh

Give me some chemistry, oh, yeah, yeah
Give me some chemistry, oh, chemistry, yeah

I can't be satisfied
Doin' it the way it's done
I got this need inside

I gotta feel some real feelin'
Give me some chemistry
Get me a shot of something hot
Ooh, somebody set me free, hey
Hey, I wanna feel the fire burnin'
Wanna live dangerously
Get me a shot of something hot
Hey, somebody set me free
Oh, honey, please set me free, oh...

Free, free, set me free
Somebody set me free
Free, free, set me free
Somebody set me free
Free, free, set me free, oh...
Somebody set me free
(Give me some chemistry)
Free, free, set me free
Somebody set me free
Free, free, set me free
Somebody set me free
Free, free, set me free
Somebody set me free...
