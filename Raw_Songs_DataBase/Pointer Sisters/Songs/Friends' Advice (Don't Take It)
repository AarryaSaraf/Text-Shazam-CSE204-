Listen to it, sort through it
Contemplate it, but don't take it

Uh-huh, uh-huh

They tell you he's not right for you
Don't they think you know that, too?
I know that he's not playing fair
I've known it for years, I'm still here
So do you think that I care?
They say, "Go out and have some fun"
"Go out," they say, "with other men"
That sounds like a simple task
But what do you do when no one asks
Do you go out with his best friend?

When it comes to friends' advice
The following usually applies:
Listen to it, sort through it
Contemplate it, but don't take it (No, no)
Don't take it (No, no)

After a month, I was tired of staying home
I looked great, but so what? I was alone
See, the last time I listened to my friends
I saw one of them walking down the street
With my ex-man
I know he is a naughty boy (Uh-huh)
And that's exactly what I enjoy
My friends could never ever handle him
Which is the reason they don't understand

When it comes to friends' advice
The following usually applies:
Listen to it, sort through it
Contemplate it, but don't take it (No, no, don't you dare)
Don't take it
You've got to listen to it, sort through it
Contemplate it, but don't take it
(No, don't take it, no, no, no, no, no, no)

My friends are trying to save my sanity (Sanity)
I really do hear what they're telling me, oh-oh (Telling me)
It's just too hard to take them seriously (Seriously)
'Cause girlfriends, they don't practice what they preach
One of them's going with Jack the Ripper
One of them's got a snob
One never gets taken out to dinner
One of them's got a slob
One of them's got the bore of the year
Another one's got a fool
One's got a man who don't even care
The other has one who's still in high school
The rest are alone(Oh-oh oh yeah, woo)
(Oh-oh oh yeah, woo) (Oh-oh oh yeah, woo)
(Oh-oh oh yeah, woo) (Oh-oh oh yeah, woo)

Listen to it, sort through it
Contemplate it, but don't take it
(Oh-oh oh yeah, woo) (Oh-oh oh yeah, woo)
Don't take it
(Oh-oh oh yeah, woo) (Oh-oh oh yeah, woo)
Listen to it, sort through it
Contemplate it, but don't take it
(Oh-oh oh yeah, woo) (Oh-oh oh yeah, woo)
Don't take it
(Oh-oh oh yeah, woo) (Oh-oh oh yeah, woo)
