When I first saw him standing there
I longed to speak but did not dare
Something inside whispered to me
You'd better move in carefully

And then he smiled and turned away
That told me all he could not say
That's when I knew he wanted me too
But I had to do some breaking through

He's so shy, he's so shy
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
He's so shy, he's so shy
And he's much too good to let get by, oh yes he is

Now holding him gently through the night
Nothing has ever felt so right
And I'm so glad I took the time
That I had to take to make him mine

He can still do things to my heart
Just like he did right from the start
Each time I see that quality
That never stops attracting me

He's so shy, he's so shy
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
He's so shy, he's so shy
That I'll love him 'till the day I die

He's so shy, he's so shy
That sweet little boy who caught my eye
I said, he's so shy, he's so shy
That I'll love him 'till the day I die, oh yeah

And he's so shy
He's so shy
He's so shy
He's so shy
