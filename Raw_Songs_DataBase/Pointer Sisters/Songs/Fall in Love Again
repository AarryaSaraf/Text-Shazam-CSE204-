We have traveled down this road before
Let's stop and talk it out
What are we fighting for
Words don't always say the pain I feel
How can I prove myself
Boy, can't you see I'm real

And when I'm near you and we touch
All my fears subside
And I see heaven in your eyes
We can break up just to make up
But it's just a waste of time
Don't you wanna fall in love again

Fall in love again, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
Fall in love again
Don't you wanna fall in love again
Fall in love again, baby, come on
Fall in love again

Ooh...

Loving you is sometimes a mystery
I can't tell when you're there
How do you really feel
And I can't stand to live my life alone
I need you here with me
Don't take my sanity, no

And when I'm near you and we touch
All my fears subside
And I see heaven in your eyes
We can break up just to make up
But it's just a waste of time
Don't you wanna fall in love again

Fall in love again, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
Don't you want to
Fall in love again
Baby, fall in love
Fall in love again
Come on and fall in love again

And when I'm near you and we touch
All my fears subside
And I see heaven in your eyes
We can break up just to make up
But it's just a waste of time
Don't you wanna fall in love again

Fall in love again, ooh, yes I do
Come on and fall in love again
Give me one more chance
Fall in love again
Baby, please, I wanna be your woman
Fall in love again
Come on, I'll be good to you

I got to have you, baby
Fall in love again
I got to, I can't help myself
Fall in love again
And when I'm with you
You can't be with no one else
Fall in love again
No, come on, come on, come on
Fall in love again

Fall in love again
Come on, fall in love
Just fall in love with me
Fall in love again
Baby, baby, baby
Fall in love again
Baby, baby, baby, baby, come on
Fall in love again
Yeah, I can't help myself

Fall in love again
Just can't help myself
Fall in love again
Come on, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Fall in love again
Oh, yeah
Fall in love again...
