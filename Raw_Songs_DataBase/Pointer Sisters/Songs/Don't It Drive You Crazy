The way I fix my hair
And paint my eyes
The perfume that I wear
No cheap disguise
Put it all to music
Makes it feel exactly like romance
Well close enough
Don't it drive you crazy
When you see me dance?

You love these sexy shoes
Oh my style
I only speak in whispers
With an evil smile
Put it all to music
Make it feel exactly like romance
Ooh, that's close enough
Don't it drive you crazy
When you see me dance?

(Dance for you) Don't it drive you crazy baby?
(Dance for you) Don't it drive you crazy baby?
(Dance for you) Don't it drive you crazy baby?
(Dance for you) Don't it drive you crazy baby?
Don't it drive you crazy 
Don't it drive you crazy 
Don't it drive you crazy 

When you see me dance?

I tease you every night
And everywhere
I know I make it hard
But I don't care
Just put it all to music
And make it feel exactly like romance
Ooh, that's close enough
Don't it drive you crazy
When you see me dance?

(Dance for you) Ooh I'm gonna get next to you
(Dance for you) Oh I wanna feel you
(Dance for you) Oh put your lips on my cheek
(Dance for you) Don't it drive you crazy!
Don't it drive you crazy 
Don't it drive you crazy 
Don't it drive you crazy 

When you see me dance?

(Gonna drive you crazy baby, gonna drive you crazy)

(Dance for you) Gonna get crazy baby
(Dance for you) Ooh I'm gonna do it to you
(Dance for you) Do anything you want me to
(Dance for you) Gonna shake my hips
(Dance for you) Touch your body baby, let me feel you close to me
(Dance for you) Drive you crazy
(Dance for you)
(Dance for you) Take off your socks baby, I don't like socks in bed
