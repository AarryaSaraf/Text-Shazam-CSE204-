Woo, mm
Oh, I'm just a flirt

Did you think I was a naughty girl
For making eyes at you?
Perhaps a little stimulation, ooh
You thought I choose to do
What you consider me intimate
I was in your arms
You'll never get to read the benefits
It's nothing more than a false alarm

You want me to provide
What you miss inside
And once it's done
You want more where that came from
Oh, maybe I will
I probably won't
I can do what nice girls don't

I'm flirtatious
A little too much
I'm flirtatious
I'm sorry if I hurt you
Flirtatious
You can look, but don't touch
Flirtatious
Ooh, I'm just a flirt

Don't believe you'll get the best of me
Because I smile a lot
There's something 'bout your personality
I guess I just forgot
That you respond to a physical
And not what's in the park
You rather make it all sensual
And nothing more than a pleasure in the dark

You want me to provide
What you miss inside
And once it's done
You want more where that came from
Oh, maybe I will (what)
I probably won't
I can do what nice girls don't

I'm flirtatious
A little too much
I'm flirtatious
I'm sorry if I hurt you
Flirtatious
You can look, but don't touch
Flirtatious
Ooh, I'm just a flirt

You want me to provide
What you miss inside
And once it's done
You want more where that came from
Oh, maybe I will (maybe I will)
I probably won't (don't do it, girl)
I can do what nice girls don't

I'm flirtatious
A little too much
I'm flirtatious
I'm sorry if I hurt you
Flirtatious
You can look, but don't touch
Flirtatious

Sorry if I hurt you
I didn't mean to turn you on
I can do what nice girls don't

I'm flirtatious
A little bit too much
I'm flirtatious
Look, don't touch
Flirtatious
You might want it all
Flirtatious
To the ball...

Flirtatious
I know you probably wanna feel
Flirtatious
But baby, let's be real
Flirtatious
You know you want it all night
Flirtatious
Touch me, we're gonna start a fight
