Are those your arms squeezin' me to pieces?
Are those your lips pressin' next to mine?
Can you explain how we ever got here like this
Love is taking over
Now we can't get any closer

So here we are, heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart
Now tell me who could have known at the start
That we'd be winding up heart to heart

Now there's nothing in the whole world
Would tear this love apart
As long as we stay, ooh baby, heart to heart
Your heart, my heart (Ooh, hoo, hoo)
Two hearts

My, oh my, where'd you learn to do that?
I'll surely die long before you're through
I've never dreamed, I've never dreamed
I could ever get you like this
When your body meets mine
It's a feeling of a lifetime

So here we are, heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart
Now tell me who could have known at the start
That we'd be winding up heart to heart

[Keyboard solo]

Now there's nothing in the whole world
Would tear this love apart

Heart to heart
Heart to heart, heart to heart
Now tell me who could have known at the start
That we'd be winding up heart to heart
Your heart, my heart (Ooh, hoo, hoo)
Two hearts
(Ahhh, ahhh)

Heart to heart (Heart, heart to heart)
Heart to heart (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Heart to heart (We got each other, baby)
Heart to heart (Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo)
Heart to heart (We are heart to heart)
Heart to heart (Gotta heart to heart)
Heart to heart (gotta heart, gotta heart)
Heart to heart (Ooh, hoo, hoo)
