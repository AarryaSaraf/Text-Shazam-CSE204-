I can feel the power surging underneath the wires
It's calling us, urging to come into the fire
There's a chain reaction when the music hits the streets
It's a transformation of current into body heat

Dance electric, you are the power, let the energy flow
Come on and dance electric, baby
Let yourself go

Dance electric, we're gonna shower sparks
All over the night
Dance electric, join in this dance electric
Come on and dance

There's a red hot circuit in the heart of the machine
And the force that's working it is taking over you and me
Then it synchronizes every movement that we make
When the voltage rises, we let all the circuits break

Dance electric, you are the power, let the energy flow
Come on and dance electric, baby
Let yourself go

Dance electric, we're gonna shower sparks
All over the night
Dance electric, join in this dance electric
Come on and dance

There's a chain reaction when the music hits the streets
It's a transformation of current into body heat

Dance electric, you are the power, let the energy flow
Come on and dance electric, baby
Let yourself go

 dance electric, we're gonna shower sparks
All over the night
Dance electric, join in the dance electric
Come on and dance

Dance electric, you are the power, let the energy flow
Come on and dance electric, baby
Let yourself go
