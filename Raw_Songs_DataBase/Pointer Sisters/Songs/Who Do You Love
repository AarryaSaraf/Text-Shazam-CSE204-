I walked miles of barbed wire, use a cobra snake for a necktie
Got a brand-new house on the roadside, made from rattlesnake hide
Got a brand-new chimney made on top, made from a human skull
Come on, Robbie, let's take a little walk, tell me who do you love?

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Arlene took me by the hand,
Says "Who are you, Ricky? I understand"

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

Come on, Robbie! I got a tombstone hand and a graveyard mind
I've turned I don't mind dyin'

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

I ride around the county and use a rattlesnake whip
Take it easy, Garth, don't you give me no lip

Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
