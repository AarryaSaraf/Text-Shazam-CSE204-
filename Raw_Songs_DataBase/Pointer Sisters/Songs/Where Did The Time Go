Hey you, where did the time go
Never saw it passin' by me
You knew how to occupy me
Hey darlin'
Where did the time go
Never let a moment linger
Wrapped me up around your finger

Fools say anyone who ever loved
Someone like you and me
Anyone who ever loves becomes too blind
To see the time go by
And I'm tellin' you that I'm searchin'

Where did the time go
Ev'ry day became about you
Till I couldn't do without you
Where did our lives go
Slipped away without me knowing
Sure knew how to keep me goin'
