It's Christmas Town, Christmas Town
We're up here in the North
Making toys for you until December 24th
We're the elves of Christmas Town
We fill up Santa's sleigh
Making sure that everyone has toys on Christmas day
Making sure that everyone has toys on Christmas day

Tap tap tap the hammer
Ring ring ring the bell
With lots of noise and clamour
For Santa's clientele
A talking doll that dances
A puppet that has strings
A rocking horse that prances
A music box that sings

Oh
It's Christmas Town, Christmas Town
We're up here in the North
Making toys for you until December 24th
We're the elves of Christmas Town
We fill up Santa's sleigh
Making sure that everyone has toys on Christmas day
Making sure that everyone has toys on Christmas day

Pick pick pick the candy
Pack pack pack the train
As elves we're pretty handy
With a car or boat or plane
We've got the list and counting
And checking every name
And though the gifts are mounting
No two will be the same

Oh, it's Christmas Town, Christmas Town
We're up here in the North
Making toys for you until December 24th
We're the elves of Christmas Town
We fill up Santa's sleigh
Making sure that everyone has toys on Christmas day
Making sure that everyone has toys on Christmas day
