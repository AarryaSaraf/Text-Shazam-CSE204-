Tell me how long must I keep
Wanting things,
Needing things, when I have so much.
There are many men who have much less than me,
Day by day they make their way.
And they find more in life thank I can see.
Tell me,

When will I learn to resist
Wanting things,
Touching things that say "do not touch."
Peo-ple that I meet seem to think I am strong,
They don't see inside of me.
So they don't know I'm weak and often wrong.
Tell me,
Why must I keep wanting things,
Needing things that just can't be mine!
(Yes, wanting things,
That just can't...
Be...
Mine...)
