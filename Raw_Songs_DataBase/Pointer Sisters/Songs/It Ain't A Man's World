For too long
we've been neglected and treated wrong
It's time you see
that every woman has her needs

Equality
that's what we want
Foundation
to build upon

It's time you changed
Look past my body and see my brain


It is time
(Every man needs a woman)
Time you accept the truth
Just want to know
I go to work until your kids give birth
Without me, what would you do?
Stop - because it ain't a man's world
Cause every boy needs a girl
I said it ain't a man's world
Open your eyes, you'll find a pearl

Cook and clean
That's all a woman used to mean
Don't you know it's time you change
Look past my body and see my brain




One thing about me, I'm little and low
Find me a man wherever I go
They calls me string bean because I'm so tall
When men see me, they're ready to fall
I'm young as morning, fresh as dew
Everybody loves me, so do you
I'm little and lean and sweet to the bone
They like to pick me up and carry me home
When I passed 40, I dropped pretense 
Cause men like women who've got some sense
55 is perfect, so is 59
Cause every man needs to rest sometime



Equality, that's what we want
Foundation, to build upon

Through hardship
we stood the test
You can't deny us
because we ain't done yet
