You knocked the love I had
(Understand what I'm saying?)
You knocked the love I had
(You know what I mean)
A-boom-boom, ah-ha (Oh-oh)
A-boom-boom-boom-boom
A-boom-boom, ah-ha (Oh-oh)
A-boom-boom-boom-boom

I forget ya, 'cause when I met ya
Boy, you were the baddest thing that I've ever seen
Before too long, something went wrong
You turned out to be low down and mean
You gave me something that I never had
A lot of insight of a man going mad
I thought you were on a mission from Hades
You were like a mad dog with a case of the rabies

You knocked the love right out of my heart
(You took my dreams and you tore them apart)
You just went wild (You lost your style)
And you knocked the love right out of my heart
You knocked the love right out of my heart

You had the look (And), and then it took
This heart of mine, and I didn't even care
You loved me tender, had to surrender
I love your toes right to the end of your hair
You used to have it but you lost control
But now you're playing some kind of dark role
Thought I had Dr. Jeckyll but I got Hyde
That's one too many but believe me I tried

You knocked the love right out of my heart
(You took my dreams and you tore them apart)
The day you hit me, you should have quit me
'Cause you knocked the love right out of my heart

You knocked the love right out of my heart
You took my dreams and you tore them apart
(You must accept) You must accept (you need help) you need help
You knocked the love right out of my heart, yeah
(You) You knocked the love, right out my heart
(You knocked the love right out of my heart)
Yes, you did
Hey boy, oh, woo
(Right, right out of my heart)

You knocked the love right out of my heart
You took my dreams and you tore them apart
Thought you were cool but you're a fool
Boy, you knocked the love right out of my heart
I didn't understand, love had me blind
But I saw the light when you were kicking my behind

You knocked the love right out of my heart
(You took my dreams and you tore them apart)
You just went wild (You lost your style)
And you knocked the love right out of my heart
You knocked the love right out of my heart
(Oh, oh, oh, yes, you did, you knocked me, you knocked me out)
You just went wild (Yeah)
You knocked the love right out of my heart

(You) You (You)
Like a mad dog (You), ow
Oh baby (You), yeah
Yeah, you won't have to knock me out, oh
(You knocked the love right out of my heart) Oh
Right my heart
(You knocked the love right out of my heart) Oh, yes, you did
