Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo
Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo
Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo
Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo

I'm still sleeping, sleeping, sleeping alone
Sleeping alone
Tossin', turnin', cryin' from sleeping alone
Sleeping alone

(He went away)
Without a sound
(He went away)
Without a sound
I'm all alone

I'm still sleeping, sleeping, sleeping alone
Sleeping alone
No one near me hears me by my pillow
By my pillow

He went away without a sound
He went away and left me here without a sound
All alone

Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo
Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo

Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo
Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo
Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo
Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo

Doo-doo-doo-do, doo doo, do-doo

I'm still sleeping, sleeping, sleeping alone
Sleeping alone
Tired of sleeping, sleeping, sleeping alone
Sleeping alone

(He went away)
Ah, you had to go, but I'm thankful for the beautiful times we had
(He went away)
Take my love as a friend, and when we meet again, it will sure make my heart feel glad
(He went away)
I'll never forget the night we kissed for the first time
(He went away)
Even though you must, you'll never go away from my mind

I have the blues
