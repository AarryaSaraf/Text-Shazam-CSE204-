Hey boy, what you tryin' to do 
Are you tryin' to make me 
Fall in love with you

I said hey boy 
Somethin's goin' on 
Maybe I've been holdin' out 
For far too long

Come and get it 
If my love looks good to you 
Come and get it 
Honey why don't you

Take my heart, take my soul 
Take the wheel, take control 
Take my life, in your hand 
Make my world, wonderland

You've been right here on my mind 
When I look into my heart 
It's you I find yeah 
Baby, you mean everything to me 
'Cause there's nothing else my eyes 
Would rather see

Come and get it 
If my love looks good to you 
Come and get it 
Honey why don't you

Take my heart, take my soul 
Take the wheel, take control 
Take my life, in your hand 
Make my world, wonderland
