Everybody wants the real thing, no imitations
Everybody wants the same thing, some tender love
Everybody on the rebound, breaking up in two
Everybody going downtown, I'm reaching out for you

Gotta wonder what the score is, sure is a shame to me
Don't you see the little children begging but no one ever sees
In the middle of the night time ohh I, I got to know

Hey You, tell me what's been going on
Hey You, tell me what's been going on

People living in the city, don't know their fellow man
People living in country, don't buy no master plan
People sent in from Erasure, to seek the promise land
Everybody wants their freedom, but do they understand

Gotta wonder what the score is, sure is a shame tome
Don't you see the lonely people, we've been following to believe
In the middle of the night time, Oh I, I got to know

Hey you, tell me, what's been going on
This world, our world, what's been going on
