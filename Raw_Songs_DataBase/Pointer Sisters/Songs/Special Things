Special things from far away
Far beyond the dream
It was not so long ago
Out of reach they seemed

They're closer, I can see them passing through
They cannot stay
Take from it what is needed
What they cost is what you pay

Everything your life is for
Are the things you will endure
Everything your life is for
Are the very things you are

Special things from far away
I've thought them, time to see them now
Life is motion not display
Even special things leave somehow

Everything your life is for
Are the things you will endure
Everything your life is for
Are the very things you are

It's important at the time
You created in your mind
But your heart will come to see
What you want may not be what you need

Everything your life is for
Are the things you will endure
Everything your life is for
Are the very things you are

Everything your life is for
Are the things you will endure
Everything your life is for
Are the very things you are
