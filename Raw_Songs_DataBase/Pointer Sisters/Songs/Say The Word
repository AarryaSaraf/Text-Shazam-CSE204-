Nah, nah, nah, say the word
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Whoo!

I've got my eye on you
Whatever my heart wants comes true
And, baby, I want you
I've got my mind made up
I'm puttin' the finger on you

'Cause I know you really want me
That's not gonna be enough
And it does no good to taunt me
'Cause what you're dreamin'
Is what I'm dreamin' of

Just say the word, yeah!
And open up the door
Just say the word, yeah!
And everything is yours
Say it, nah, nah, nah
Say the word, say the word
Say it, nah, nah, nah
And the word is love

Say it to me, baby, now

You whet my appetite
It's a crime
Makin' me hungry for more
I gotta have it
This love you get tonight
Is not like anything you had before

'Cause you've got to be my witness
And, boy, you've got to testify
And I'll cover you with kisses
My heart's the truth
And the truth, it never lies

Just say the word, yeah!
We're just one word away
Say the word, yeah!
It's what you wanna say
Say it, nah, nah, nah
Say the word, say the word
Say it, nah, nah, nah
It's what you're dreamin' of

Say it, nah, nah, nah
Say the word, say the word
Say it, nah, nah, nah
Let your heart believe
Say it, nah, nah, nah
Say the word, say the word
Say it, nah, nah, nah
And the word is love

Nah, nah, nah, say the word
Nah, nah, nah, say the word
Nah, nah, nah, say the word
Nah, nah, nah, just say the word, ooh...

Nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah

Say it, nah, nah, nah
Say the word, say the word
Say it, nah, nah, nah
And the word is love
Say it, nah, nah, nah
Say the word, say the word
Say it, nah, nah, nah
Say the word out loud...
