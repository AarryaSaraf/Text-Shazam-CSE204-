I know you want us both and I know the reason why (I know why you want her)
I can give you so much lovin', but presents she can buy ya (how much can money buy)
Last night you're in my arms, but tonight I'm all alone
How long (how long) will this game go on, How long (how long) Oh oh how long?

It's plain, plain enough to see that you're not happy with me
I can't keep playing gamest o keep my heart straight
I want to turn to walk away but it's harder to do than it is to say
How long (how long) will this game go on, How long (how long) Oh oh how long?

It might hurt me for a while
But one thing I am sure
I'll get over you, yes I'll find someone new
Each time I open up my heart
It seems to just get torn apart
How long
Will this game go on
How long
Oh oh how long
