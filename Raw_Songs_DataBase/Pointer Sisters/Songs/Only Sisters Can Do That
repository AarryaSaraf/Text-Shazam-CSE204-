Walking home from school
breaking every rule that's in the book
(Remember when we were still in school?)

Singing in the street
Harmonies complete
That's all it took
(Just throw a dime -- throw a dime, we'll sing for you)

Cause I know that girl
and she knows me so well
Her story, I can tell
It's just like mine

Only sisters can do that
(No one in the world could react this way)
Only sisters can do that
Only sisters can
(Take a look back in history)

Only sisters can do that
(All around the world, can you hear me, girl?)
Sisters can do that
Only sisters can

Love would come and go
Mama didn't know the fun we had
(She didn't know where we went after school)
Playing with the boys
Switching them like toys
Oh we were bad
(We were bad, we were nobody's fool)

And we have laid the ground for all the girls in town
but they won't stay around
They just won't last

Only sisters can do that
(No one in the world could react this way)
Sisters can do that
Only sisters can
(Make you feel like family)

Only sisters can do that
(All around the world, can you hear me, girl?)
Sisters can do that
Only sisters can

We can do that
We can do that

Only we can do that
Only we can do that

Only sisters can do that
(No one in the world could react this way)
Only sisters can do that
Only sisters can
(Take a look back in history)

Only sisters can do that
(All around the world, can you hear me, girl?)
Sisters can do that
Only sisters can
