I walked down feelin' sad and confused
Just out lookin' for someone to use
Have to find somethin' sweet and complete
Let these high heels hit the street now

So I made my way to Tony's grill
That's a place where I could find a thrill
Saw a man who can fit the bill
I need love so bad I could kill

He took control of me
The heart and soul of me
He gave me such good love
Now he's all that I dream of

He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out
He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out

I never knew how good it could be
He turned out the light
And turned on the love in me
In a flash, he touched me so deep
No more secrets I could keep

He set a spark in me
He lit the dark in me
He got that magic stuff
Now I can't get enough

He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out
He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out

He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out
He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out

He took control of me
The heart and soul of me
He gave me such good love
Now he's all that I dream of

He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out
He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out

He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out
He turned me, turned me, turned me
Turned me, turned me out
