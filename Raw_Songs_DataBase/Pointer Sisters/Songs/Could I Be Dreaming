Through the night while I was fast asleep
I could feel you touching me
Felt like a dream
Then I slowly opened my eyes
You were laying by my side
Oh, what a night!
Could I be dreamin'?
Are you really with me, are you right
Here by my side?
Could I be dreamin'?
I've waited for this moment oh so long
And now you're mine
No, it's not a dream
Boy, you know I like your company
And I'm glad you said to me
"Baby, can I come inside?"
Aren't you glad I opened up my door
Because we both knew the score
And the time was right
No, I'm not dreamin'
You're really, really with me and I love
The way it feels
No, I'm not dreamin'
I've waited for this moment oh so long

And now it's real
No, it's not a dream
Life will come to show that
All things come and go but
I'm sure glad to know
I've got you here, and I love the feeling
So sincere, your love has got me spinning
I'm not dreamin'
You're really, really here with me and I love
The way it feels
No, I'm not dreamin'
I've waited for this moment oh so long
And now it's here
I should be screamin', Oh
Telling everybody just how good
You make me feel
No, I'm not dreamin', no
I've got you here beside me and this time
My love is real
Could I be dreamin'?
Or are you really with me, are you right
Here in my arms?
No, I'm not dreamin'
I love you, I love you from this moment on
