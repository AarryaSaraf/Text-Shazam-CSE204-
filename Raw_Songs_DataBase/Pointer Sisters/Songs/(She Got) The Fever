When I get home from my job
I turn on the T.V.
But I can't keep my mind
On the show
When I lay down at night
I don't get no sleep
So I turn on the radio
But Lord the only thing
I hear is you
Whispering in my ear
The words that you used to say
Well now the days grow longer
My love grows stronger
The fever gets worse every day

I got the fever for this guy
She's got the fever
Oh she's got the fever
Nothing that a girl can do
When she's got the fever
For this guy
She's got the fever
Oh she's got the fever
Left this little girl blue

I used to see you walking home
I'd be standin' at the stove
With the dishes on the table
Dinner ready to go
Or maybe we'd o to a movie show
Something that you'd like to see
Oh you were my sun in the mornin'
You were my moon at night
When I think about it
Makes me feel alright
Well now the days grow longer
And my love grows stronger
And the fever gets so bad at night

I got the fever for this guy
She's got the fever
Oh she's got the fever
Nothing that a girl can do
When she's got the fever
For this guy
She's got the fever
Oh she's got the fever
Left this little girl blue
