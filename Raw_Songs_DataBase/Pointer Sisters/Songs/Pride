Respect, you want
You want my breathless adoration
Where's your dedication?
Hey, hey baby baby don't look now
but you're about to lose

'Cause you make me so mad
Sad and a feeling blue
And you make me lonely
All from a lovin' you
And it's getting so bad
My crying don't get through


And you just hold on to your, hold on to your
Pride, pride 
Dignity or vanity?
Do you know the meaning?
Pride, pride
When your love lies helplessly
pride can be, baby, such a lonely feeling

You want my love
but you don't give me the satisfaction
Where's my satisfaction?
Tell me - why should I give you everything you're looking for?

'Cause you make me so mad
Sad and a feeling blue
And you make me lonely
All from a lovin' you
And it's getting so bad
My crying don't get through



So mad
Lonely
So bad
