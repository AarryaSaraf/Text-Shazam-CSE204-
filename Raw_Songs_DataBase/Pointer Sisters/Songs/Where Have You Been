Where have you been?
What are you looking for?
Tell me, old friend
When you turn out the light
Close your eyes for the night
Does your mind go astray?
Are you running away from yourself?
Don't be afraid to ask for help

We shared so much together
Our dreams went on forever
Living like the day would never end
Then came the stormy weather
Our lives were torn and shattered
We were forced to stop and start again

It's never easy to face the fact
That you have made a mistake and yet
Isn't it time that you found
The purpose of living that brings peace of mind?

And where have you been?
(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
And what are you looking for?
(What are you looking for way out there on your own?)
Tell me, old friend:
(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
When you turn out the lights
Close your eyes for the night
Does your mind go astray?
Are you running away from yourself?
Don't be afraid to ask for help

If we were merely strangers
Oblivious to dangers
That living in the shadows can lead you to
I wouldn't speak so freely
But in your eyes, I see me
The lesson that life has taught me I give to you

What you give out will come back to you
Isn't it time that you faced the truth?
Stop holding so much inside
Admit to yourself that you're not satisfied

And where have you been?
(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
What are you looking for?
(What are you looking for way out there on your own?)
Tell me, old friend:
(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
When you turn off the lights
Close your eyes for the night
Does your mind go astray?
Are you running away from yourself?
Don't be afraid to ask for help

(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
I'll be right there, I'll see you over
When you're not strong, I'll be your shoulder

Where have you been?
(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
What are you looking for?
(What are you looking for way out there on your own?)
Tell me, old friend:
(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
When you turn out the lights
Close your eyes for the night
Does your mind go astray?
Are you running away from yourself?
Don't be afraid

When I was cold
When I was tired
I didn't know if anybody cared
But you see, I had to turn around and look at myself
Nobody else understood me
(When you turn out the lights)
But I made it through
(Close your eyes for the night)
And you can too
(Does your mind go astray?)
(Are you running away from yourself?)
Running, running, running, running, running away
I've been missing you, old friend
(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
I've been missing you, old friend
Yeah, been missing you, baby
I've been missing you, old friend
I've been missing you
I've been missing you, old friend
I've been missing you, old friend
You don't have to worry
(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
I've been missing you, old friend
You don't have to cry no more, ah nah, baby
I've been missing you, old friend
Nah, baby
It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh-hoo
I've been missing you, old friend
(Where have you been? You've been away so long)
I've been missing you
