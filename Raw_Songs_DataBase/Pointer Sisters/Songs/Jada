Jada's coming home.
Jada's coming home. 
She will not cross the Bay bridge, 
But she ain't gone for long.
Jada's coming home.
Jada's quite a gall. 
She's in love with Al.
But he don't love her, no we know,
He is in love with sadly so. 
He's gonna break her heart.
Now when she drives up in that Volvo,
And the horn begins to blow.
I am gonna get out my chair, 
Run down the stairs,
And open up the door.
Jada is my friend.
Don't want to see her hurt again.
'Cause she has such a pretty smile,
Jada is my only child.

(het slot is erg moeilijk te verstaan
Maar hier een voorzichtige poging)
Bad I hurt him then, 
And he will hardly have a hope.
Sorrow sitting there, ribbons in her hair,
Such a pretty child, oh what a smile. 
He loves me, he loves me not,
He loves me not, that's what I got.
I taught you all your ABC's, didn't I? 
Here me out. Why don't you leave me at all. 
Boom! She-bop! She's gonna go for the top.  
Sure can't tell her when to stop. 
Easy cause her daddy,
Don't you mess with my daughter.
Jada's coming home.
