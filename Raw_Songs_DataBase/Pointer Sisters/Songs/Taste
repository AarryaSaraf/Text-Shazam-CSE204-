My body's hot and my palms are sweaty baby
Don't look surprised when you
Know you got me ready for you
Got me ready for you baby
Temperature's risin', you know I'm hungry for ya
Just close your eyes and give me
Just a taste of your love
Just a taste of your love baby
I've been waiting such a long time for your lovin'
Don't make me think I'm spending my
Time just for nothing
Oh, baby please, give me just a taste
Of your love, ooh.
I need a taste of your love
Give me just a taste of your love, oh
A taste of love, give me just a taste of your love
I need a taste of love, every single day,
It's your love
You start me up, don't ever quit
I need a taste, give just a little bit
My spirit's high and my pulse is steady baby
You can't deny that you know you
Got me ready for you
Got me ready for you baby
Ain't nothing taxing, I'll make it easy on you
Just try relaxing
Give me just a taste of your love baby
You've been saying that your love
Is more that passion
I'm tired of listening
Now you know I want some action
Oh, baby please give me just a taste of your love
I need a taste of your love
Don't be afraid of my love
A taste of love, give me just a taste of your love
I need a taste of love,
Every single day, it's your love
You wind me up, I must admit
I need a taste, give just a little bit
I've been waiting such a long time for your loving
Don't make me think I'm spending
My time just for nothing
Oh, baby please, give just a taste
Of your love, ooh
