Have you heard I've been asking about you
Have you heard I'm still here
Have you heard that your leaving brought me tears
But they disappeared
And I got myself together
Started all over now
There's a change in my life
And I'm so proud
I can face the crowd

Movin' on
Movin' on without you
Movin' on
On without you
Movin' on
Movin' on without you
I'll find love again
I'll find love again

I was so foolish and excited
Made myself believe a lie
And unaware that love was open wide
I just thought I'd die
But I got myself together
Started all over, now
(Started over)
There's a change in my life
And I'm so proud
It makes me wanna shout out loud

Movin' on
Movin' on without you
Movin' on
On without you
Movin' on
Movin' on without you
I'll find love again
I'll find love again
I'll find love again

And I'm never gonna stop
Until I've got
All the things in life I need
'Cause I just can't live
My life
On faded memories
And I'm movin' on my own
And getting closer to
A better side of me
Pushing harder than before
And making sure
That I don't get hurt no more
I'm

Movin' on
Movin' on without you
Movin' on
On without you
Movin' on
Movin' on without you
I'll find love again
(I'm gonna keep)
Movin' on
Movin' on without you
Movin' on
Movin' on
Movin' on
Movin' on without you
I'll find love again
(Gonna find it)
(I'm gonna)
(Move on)
Movin' on without you
Movin' on
