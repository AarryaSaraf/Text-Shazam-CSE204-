Well we've sat around and talked for hours,
And I've really nothing left to say,
I just wish you'd open up as well,
As you hide your heart away.

Say what you want say what you will right now,
I think I know you better than you know yourself,
Oh baby, (oh baby) 
Save it all for somebody else.

I can feel your heart beat,
Heart beat baby,
Playing what you live to feel,
I feel your heart beat,
Heart beat baby,
And it tells me how you really feel.

You remind me of a lonely child,
Who's been hurt by love before,
Honey I've been down that road myself,
And there's one thing that I found for sure.

You're holding back you'll miss it all you take your chances,
That's the only way to go,
Oh baby, (oh baby) 
Come and let your feelings show.

I can feel your heart beat,
Heart beat baby,
Even now as you deny your fire,
I feel your heart beat,
Heart beat,
Moving to the rhythm of your true desire.

You're holding back you'll miss it all you take your chances,
That's the only way to go,
Oh baby, (oh baby) 
Come and let your feelings show.

Listen to your heart beat,
Heart beat baby,
Playing what you live to feel,
I feel your heart beat,
Heart beat baby,
And it tells me how you really feel.

Heart beat, heart beat baby,
Even now as you deny your fire,
Yeah heart beat, heart beat,
Moving to the rhythm of your true desire.

Heart beat, heart beat baby,
Heart beat, heart beat baby.
