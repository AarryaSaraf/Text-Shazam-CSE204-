When you get inside my head
It just goes empty
With all that junk I been fed
You think I'd let you get me

Hey baby what are you blind
How long you been gone
I'm not the returning kind
I don't need you to lean on

You come to me with eyes all watery
Do you believe I'll fall in
Poor little thing so out of date
Now I can say your love has
Turned up too late

If you were the sun and moon
I'd still cloud over
Rain would still fall down too soon
And we would just grow colder

Hey baby I ain't ashamed
Of being turned down
I hope you got the same strength
You're gonna need it now

You come to me with eyes all watery
Do you believe I'll fall in
Poor little thing so out of date
Now I can say your love has
Turned up too late

Love takes a toll on ev'ryone Baby
You're gonna find out someday
It don't feel too good
It don't feel too great to tell you
It's turned up too late

You come to me with eyes all watery
Do you believe I'll fall in
Poor little thing so out of date
Now I can say your love has
Turned up too late
Now I can say your love has
Turned up too late
Turned up too late
