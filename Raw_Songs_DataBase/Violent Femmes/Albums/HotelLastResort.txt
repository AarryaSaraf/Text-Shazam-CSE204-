// I'm Nothing //

I am N-O-T-H-I-N'
I am N-O-T-H-I-N'
I am N-O-T-H-I-N'
I'm nothin'

I am N-O-T-H-I-N'
I am N-O-T-H-I-N'
I am N-O-T-H-I-N'
I'm nothin'

Are you Republican or Democrat?
A liberal fascist full of crap?
I'm nothin', I'm nothin'
Somebody somewhere said he was something
But everybody, everywhere knows that I'm nothin'

Politics and dirty tricks - I got no time for stones and sticks
Politics and dirty tricks - I got no time for chasin' chicks
I'm nothin', I'm nothin'
Somebody somewhere said he was something
But everybody, everywhere saying I'm nothin'

There's nothin' high, there's nothin' low
'Cause being nothin' this is our flow

Are you gay or are you straight?
Do you believe in love or do you believe in hate?
I'm nothin', I'm nothin'
Somebody somewhere said he was something
But everybody, everywhere is sayin' I'm nothin'

I'm nothin', I'm like a cloud
I'm free to be alone in a crowd

What's your reality? It's not real to me
What's your anomaly? It is my destiny

I am N-O-T-H-I-N'
I am N-O-T-H-I-N'
I am N-O-T-H-I-N'
I'm nothin'
I'm nothin'
I'm nothin'

I'm nothin' now and I'm nothin' free
'Cause being nothin' is just being me

// Another Chorus //

This place is alright and the band is okay
Took a bit to get here so we might as well stay
But what's the singer saying, it's hard to really know
But here it comes again (oh no) oh no, oh no, oh no

Please don't sing another chorus
That's the thing that starts to bore us
Please don't sing another chorus
Please don't sing

A verse is like a chorus if you sing it more than once
This feels like it's been going on for days and weeks and months
What's the singer saying, i'd give it up to know
But here it comes again (oh no) oh no, oh no, oh no

Please don't sing another chorus
That's the thing that really bores us
Please don't sing another chorus
Please don't sing

Some things go on forever
Seemingly and endlessly
Like this band's best endeavor
To sing a chorus unceasingly

Oh this place is alright and the band is okay
Took a bit to get in so we might as well stay
But what's the singer saying, I don't even wanna know
But here it comes again (oh no) oh no, oh no, oh no
Here it comes again (oh no) oh no, oh no, oh no

Please don't sing another chorus
That's the thing that really bores us
Please don't sing another chorus
Please don't sing (please don't sing)

Please don't sing another chorus
That's the thing that really bores us
Please don't sing another chorus
Please don't sing (please don't sing)

Please don't sing another chorus
That's the thing that really bores us
Please don't sing another chorus
Please don't sing

// I Get What I Want //

Is this too hard
For little you to understand?
Then that's too bad for you
'Cause I don't ask, I command

This is what you will be denied
'Til you learn to do what you are told
You could have it all if you tried
But baby, please, it's getting old

If you can't obey me
Then you don't deserve me

I get what I want
And I want what I get
I want what I get
And I get what I want

Don't speak unless spoken to
Is this really so hard to do?
I took a picture for you
I was in the mood
You better pay attention, dude
I was in the nude
And I really could have screwed

So this is what you will be denied
'Til you learn to do what you are told
You could have me all if you tried
But baby, please, I'm getting old

If you can't obey me
Then you don't deserve me

I get what I want
And I want what I get
I want what I get
And I get what I want

I get what I want (Is this too hard)
And I want what I get (For little you to understand?)
I want what I get (Then that's too bad for you)
And I get what I want ('Cause I don't ask, I command)

I get what I want (Is this too hard)
And I want what I get (For little you to understand?)
I want what I get (Then that's too bad for you)
And I get what I want ('Cause I don't ask, I command)

// Adam Was A Man //

Adam was a man
Just like you or me
He did not do what he's supposed to
And he cries internally

There's horror in Paradise
In the garden of delight
Where sorrow can paralyze
The will to want the right

Eve was a woman
Just like you or me
She did not do what she's supposed to do
And she cries eternally

There's trouble in Paradise
In the pathways of delight
Where the rubble blocks the road of life
There's no light to light in the night

(What about that snake?)

Snake was an animal
Almost like you or me
He said to do what we're no supposed to
And he lies so reasonably

Because there's madness in Paradise
The asylum of delight
And gladness breaks no morning light
[?] broken will and might

God was God
Not like you or me
He always does and he does just because
So we hope he stays so friendly

He's the tailor of Paradise
In the sweatshops of delight
Clothing a pair of eyes
And the beauty of wrong and right

Adam was a man
Just like you or me

// Not OK //

I could write something better in my sleep
I could sing so pretty it'd make your heart weep
I could steal a kiss but it could not keep out love

I could read something better in a book
I could break your heart with just one look
You could tear me apart and that's what you mistook for love

Gone away (Gone away)
Far astray (Far astray)
It's gone today (It's gone today)
And it is not okay

I can hear so much better than you can speak
I can see right through you with just one peek
So why'd you go and try to seek more love?

Gone away (Gone away)
Far astray (Far astray)
It's gone today (It's gone today)
And it is not okay

You can sing so much better in the shower
You can count up the minutes that make up an hour
That's all it did take to crush and break our love

But I could write something better in my sleep
I could sing so pretty it'd make your heart weep
You can steal a kiss but it will not keep my love

Gone away (Gone away)
Far astray (Far astray)
It's gone today (It's gone today)
And I am not okay

// Hotel Last Resort //

I don't change the chords anymore
The chords change by themselves

The time luxury affords any bore
Turns towards all the whistles and bells
I can't even remember my best past retort
I'm in a resort town at the Hotel Last Resort

Who did I not call?
What did I not write?
Blue spring, gold fall
Green summer, winter white
Someone's singing in another language
I think, might be English

The ship is leaking tonnage and tankage
They sink, lightly sing fish
Message says: "Ship's flag flies at half mast, report"
But no message can be sent from the Hotel Last Resort

You wrote me so many letters
I keep them in a bag
New hope so many "feel betters"
But jets aren't the only things that lag

Bodies in motion tend to stay in motion
Bodies at rest...
That's inertia, inertia, inertia

"Did I win a million bucks?" Yes you did
And now you go to where the lodgings are deluxe
And join me in my bed where we will blaze, blast, contort
Alive or dead, laying in the Hotel Last Resort

I don't like to snorkel
And I don't, don't want to swim
I don't laugh but I chortle
When I pass, by the gym
I don't take a tour
I don't take on a guide
My fields I rake with manure
I'm fertilizing for pride
But the mission has been pulled
All agents must abort
And I am losing my patience
At the Hotel Lust Resort

I've become invisible
Because 1 is not divisible
I wander like the Jews
I ponder on my muse
I pander to the few
I divide myself by 2
Half of half is still half
And a chortle is still
Not a real laugh

Yo bro, where the hoes at? Asked a sport
Nobody knows that at the Hotel Last Resort

In my tomorrow I got here, I checked out
Before I checked in
Vaclac Havel likes beer
And sorrows for things Slovakian
He could've been my best friend
Of human wrongs, I wished we had spoke
Fine weather in the west wind
My Cuban songs I sing for the Pope
I'm still tryin' to get some rest in this castle, this social fort
Wishing you all the best, from the Hotel Last Resort

I don't change the chords anymore
The chords change by themselves

// Everlasting You //

Faith, faith in you
Unshakeable, true
Hope, all in you
Unwavering, true

Love, ever true
Everlasting you
Love, ever new
Everlasting you

Everlasting love
Everlasting love

Everlasting love
Everlasting love
Everlasting love
You

// It's All Or Nothing //

Every time you start to whine
You could stop on a dime
You could change your mind
Have you done your best
Can you pass that test
That's a hundred percent
It's just like payin' the rent

'Cause its all or nothing
Yes its all, all or nothing
And when you fall, it's really something
But you give your all
Or you give nothing

If you like me like I like you
Let's take it slow
That'll make it grow
I can't tell you what you should do
But I thought you should know
I'm only good to go

If it's all or nothing
With me it's all or nothing
And if I fall, that will be something
But I give my all
Or I give nothing

Oh it's all or nothing
Life is all, all or nothing
And when you fall
It's really something
But you give your all
Or you get nothing, nothing

You give your all
Or you get nothing
You give your all
Or you get nothing
You give your all
Or you get nothing
You give your all
Or you get nothing

// I'm Not Gonna Cry //

Oh, I counted up last night
All our little times
You, yes you
Were just a drop in the rain
And even if I can't
Ever touch you again
By myself I will try
To hide, to lose you, and be lost

But I'm not gonna cry anymore for you
And don't you ask for me
I'm not gonna cry anymore for you
And don't you ask for me

Oh, I got drunk last night
Thinking about our times
You, yes you
Were just a drop in the wine
And even if I can't
Ever touch you again
By myself I will try
To hide, to lose you, and be lost

But I'm not gonna cry anymore for you
And don't you ask for me
I'm not gonna cry anymore for you
And don't you ask for me

I'm not gonna cry anymore for you
And don't you ask for me
I'm not gonna cry anymore for you
And don't you ask for me

// This Free Ride //

I am on a free ride
I'll be fit to be tied
I don't need no kind of pride
Not with me on this free ride

Near and far, far and wide
Hey, your car's a great ride
Alright, maybe I just lied
But it's still a free ride

I am on a free ride
I'll be fit to be tied
And I don't need your pride
Not with me on this free ride

Easy-peasy, I'm like "Dag"
Cold and greasy in a paper bag
Cool and breezy, chicken hard-fried
Ain't nothin' easy on this frickin' free ride

I am on a free ride
I'll be gone with every tide
And I don't need no drive
Not with me on this free ride

Aw, hey, I got nothing inside
Nada nada, alas I sighed
Weep for the weeper, I cried
I creep like a creeper on my frickin' free ride

I am on a free ride
And although I'll be fit to be tied
Man, I don't need your pride
Not with me on this free ride

I've been sailing on The Bounty
I'm seeing Captain Bligh
Crossing into the county
Mutiny on this free ride

Hey, hey, I tried
Oh, sorry again, I just lied
I would've flown in if I could've flied
But I'm just blown by the winds in my free ride

I am on a free ride
I'll be gone with every tide
And you don't need no kind of pride
Not with me on this free ride
Not if you're with me on my free ride

// Paris To Sleep //

Paris to sleep, two, three, four

Some people come here to drink
True or not true, what do you think?
And the wine flows, so the line goes
Makes the old young and I'm told it's fun
And yes, I had a drink or two or three or perhaps more
But they are not what I came here for
Please, lover, don't let the terror scare us too deep
And I came to Paris to sleep

Some people come here to think
Philosophy agrees with me, and you, would you like a drink?
And the time goes whichever way the mind wind blows
It makes the young old, it's not fun, I am told
And yes, I had a thought or two or three or perhaps more
But these are not what I came here for
My brother, don't let the terror scare us too deep
And I came to Paris to sleep

I'm sorry I was late and you waited all day
True or not true, I feel this way
I lay in the bed and I waited all day
For feeling to pass and not stay
I'm sorry, it was great and then it went away
I'm sorry I was late again today

Some people come here for love
Is this for you? Yes, I think so, my love
Oh, love comes and comes and goes and goes and the love-light lies lying low
You never know, you never know
I guess I had a love or two or three or perhaps more
But losing lost love is not worth losing for
All the horror and the terror may tear us and scare us to sleep
Or it may bear us to Paris where I came to weep

// Sleepin' At The Meetin' //

One, two, three

I was sleepin' at the meetin'
At the meetin' I was sleepin'
I was sleepin' at the meetin'
At the meetin' I was sleepin'
At the meetin' I was sleepin'
I was sleepin' at the meetin'
I was sleepin' at the meetin'
At the meetin' I was sleepin'
At day I did sleep
The way that I creep

I was nappin' and a-crappin'
I was crappin' and a-nappin'
I was nappin' and a-crappin'
I was crappin' and a-nappin'
I was nappin' and a-crappin'
I was crappin' and a-nappin'
I was nappin' and a-crappin'
I was crappin' in a napkin
And I make lotta shit
The way that I creep

Well you think you got me 'cause you know I was there
Well, so what? I don't care
You ain't got nothin' even though I was there
Yeah, I was right there sleeping in my chair

I was thinkin' in a Lincoln
In a Lincoln I was thinkin'
I was thinkin' in a Lincoln
In a Lincoln I was thinkin'
In a Lincoln I was thinkin'
I was thinkin' in a Lincoln
In a Lincoln I was thinkin'
I was thinkin' in a Lincoln
Layin' in the backseat
The way that I creep

Well you think you got me 'cause you know I was there
Well, so what? I don't care
You ain't got nothin' even though I was there
Yeah I was right there sleepin' in my chair

Way that I creep (Come on)
Way that I creep (Everybody now)
Way that I creep (Yes)
Way that I creep

Can't stand the kitchen, I can't stand the heat
(Way that I creep)
Fahrenheit rising the way that I creep
(Way that I creep)
Can't take the bitchin', I can't stay oblique
(Way that I creep)
Celsius rising the way that I creep
(Way that I creep)
You may win today, I won't say that I'm beat
(Way that I creep)
Who can say the way that I creep
(Way that I creep)
And anyone know a Catwoman in heat
(Way that I creep)
That's the way I go, that's the way I creep
(Way that I creep)
You know, baby, I was thinking that maybe we could meet
(Way that I creep)
You know, baby baby baby, in the way that I creep
(Way that I creep)
Oh I take my whiskey neat
The way that I creep
(Way that I creep)

// God Bless America //

God bless America, land that I love
God bless America, land that I love

Stand beside her and guide her
Through the night with a light from above
From the mountains to the prairies
To the oceans white with foam

God bless America, my home sweet home
God bless America, my home sweet home

God bless America, land that I love

Stand beside her and guide her
Through the night with a light from above
From the mountains to the prairies
To the oceans white with foam

God bless America, my home sweet home
God bless America, my home sweet home
