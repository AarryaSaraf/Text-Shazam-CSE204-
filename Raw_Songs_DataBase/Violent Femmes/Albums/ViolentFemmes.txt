// Blister In The Sun //

When I'm out walkin', I strut my stuff
Yeah, and I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite, I just might
Stop to check you out

Let me go on...
Like I blister in the sun
Let me go on...
Big hands, I know you're the one

Body and beats, I stain my sheets
I don't even know why
My girlfriend, she's at the end
She is starting to cry

Let me go on...
Like I blister in the sun
Let me go on...
Big hands, I know you're the one

When I'm out walkin', I strut my stuff
Yeah, and I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite, I just might
Stop to check you out
When I'm out walkin', I strut my stuff
Yeah, and I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite, I just might
Stop to check you out

Body and beats, I stain my sheets
I don't even know why
My girlfriend, she's at the end
She is starting to cry

When I'm out walkin', I strut my stuff
Yeah, and I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite, I just might
Stop to check you out

Let me go on...
Like I blister in the sun
Let me go on...
Big hands, I know you're the one

// Kiss Off //

I need someone, a person to talk to
Someone who'd care to love
Could it be you?
Could it be you?

The situation gets rough, and I start to panic
It's not enough, it's just a habit
And, kid, you're sick
Well, darling, this is it

Well, you can all just kiss off into the air
Behind my back, I can see them stare
They'll hurt me bad, but I won't mind
They'll hurt me bad, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time, do it all the time

I hope you know that this will go down on your permanent record!
Oh, yeah? Well, don't get so distressed
Did I happen to mention that I'm impressed?

I take one, one, one 'cause you left me
And two, two, two for my family
And three, three, three for my heartache
And four, four, four for my headaches
And five, five, five for my lonely
And six, six, six for my sorrow
And seven, seven for no tomorrow
And eight, eight, I forget what eight was for
But nine, nine, nine for the lost gods
Ten, ten, ten, ten for everything, everything, everything

Well, you can all just kiss off into the air
Behind my back, I can see them stare
They'll hurt me bad, but I won't mind
They'll hurt me bad, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time, do it all the time, do it all the time

// Please Do Not Go //

Tell ya, man, I'm stuck on this lovely girl
Of course to me, she mean all t' world
But then she like another guy
I fall down dead, she never see the tears I cry

So please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go

How long can the days go on when my love is so strong?
And I know I cannot tell a lie, I want to see him go bye
Goodbye, bye, goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Now I wonder, I wonder what she would say
If I told her, if I told her I felt this way
You know it might make her turn, might make her turn
Might make her turn either way
So all I can do is patiently pray, pray, pray, pray, pray

So please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go

How long can the days go on when my love is so strong?
And I know I cannot tell a lie, I want to see him go bye
Goodbye, bye, goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye

I'll tell you, man, I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck on this lovely girl
And y'know I'd travel, I could travel over the whole world
And you know what she does, she turn around and like another guy
I fall down dead, she never see the tears I cry

Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please, you hurt me so
Please, please, please, you hurt me so
Please, please, please, I've got something to show

// Add It Up //

Day after day, I will walk and I will play
But the day after today, I will stop and I will start

Why can't I get just one kiss?
Why can't I get just one kiss?
There may be some things that I wouldn't miss
But I look at your pants and I need a kiss

Why can't I get just one screw?
Why can't I get just one screw?
Believe me, I know what to do
But something won't let me make love to you

Why can't I get just one fuck?
Why can't I get just one fuck?
I guess it's got something to do with luck
But I waited my whole life for just one...

Day after day, I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I'll take a bow and say goodnight

Oh, ma-mama, mama-mo-ma-mum
Have you kept your eye, your eye on your son?
I know you've had problems, you're not the only one
When your sugar left, he left you on the run

Oh, ma-mama, mama-mo-ma-mum
Take a look now at what your boy has done
He's walking around like he's number one
Went downtown and you got him a gun

So don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
Don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
You know you've got my sympathy
But don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me

So don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
Don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
You know you've got my sympathy
But don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me

Broken down kitchen at the top of the stairs
Can I mix in with your affairs?
Share a smoke, make a joke
Grasp and reach for a leg of hope

Words to memorize, words hypnotize
Words make my mouth exercise
Words all failed the magic prize
Nothing I can say when I'm in your thighs

Oh, ma-mama, mo-ma, mo-ma mother
I would love to love you, lover
City is restless, it's ready to pounce
Here in your bedroom, ounce for ounce

Oh, ma-mama, mo-ma, mo-ma mother
I would love to love you, lover
City is restless, it's ready to pounce
Here in your bedroom, ounce for ounce

I've given you a decision to make
Things to lose, things to take
Just as she's about ready to cut it up
She says, "Wait a minute, honey, I'm gonna add it up!"
Add it up! Add it up! Add it up!

Day after day, I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I'll take a bow and say goodnight

// Confessions //

People worry, what are they worrying about today?
People worry, what are they worrying about today?
Seems like there's a good reason to worry, worry, worry
Seems like there's a damn good reason to worry, worry, worry
I'd sit around, I'd listen to your story if I wasn't in such a hurry, hurry, hurry

And I'm so lonely, I just don't think I can take it any more
And I'm so lonely, I just don't know what to do
And I'm so lonely, feel like I'm gonna crawl away and die
And I'm so lonely, feel like I'm gonna hack it apart
And I'm so lonely, feel like I'm gonna crawl away and die
And I'm so lonely, feel like I'm gonna hack it apart
I'm gonna hack, hack, hack, hack it apart

Seems like there's a good reason to be lonely, lonely, lonely
I gotta get someone or somebody or something to make me feel less lonely, lonely, lonely
I know I could do it, I know I could do it if I wasn't so lonely, lonely, lonely

Have we got an army? We'll teach you how to act like a man
Have we got an army? Man, I mean to tell you we can fight
Have we got an army? And we're gonna do it tonight
Do, do, do, do it tonight
Yeah, they're gonna pay, pay, pay, pay it tonight
Do, do, do, do it tonight...

People worry, what are they worrying about today? People worry
And you see, I've learned my lessons
And I don't even want to hear about your confessions

// Prove My Love //

Just last night, I was reminded of
Just how bad it had gotten
And just how sick I had become

But it could change with this relationship
De-derange, we've all been through some shit
And if we're thing, I think this thing's begun
Oh, tell me now, what do I have to do
Oh, tell me now, what do I have to do
Oh, tell me now, what do I have to do
To prove my love to you?

Special favors come in 31 flavors
We're out of mints, pass the Life Savers
I'm droppin hints, candy for candy-coated tongue

You'd be so good, so very good for me
What do you think? Tell me honestly?
I'm wait-wait-wait-waiting for you to come
Oh, tell me now, what do I have to do
Yeah, tell me now, what do I have to do
Yeah, tell me now, what do I have to do
Yeah, prove my love to you

Third verse, same as the first
Just last night, I was reminded of
Just how bad it had gotten
And just how sick I had become

But it could change with this relationship
De-derange, we've all been through some shit
And if we're thing, I think this thing's begun

Oh, tell me now, what do I have to do
Yeah, tell me now, what do I have to do
I'd do anything, what do I have to do
I'd do it all, what do I have to do
I'd do it all for you, what do I have to do
I'd do anything, I'd do it all, I'd do it all for you
I'd climb a mountain, I'd cross the ocean, I'd do it it all
Tell me now, what do I have to do to prove my love to you?

// Promise //

You know that I want your loving
But my logic tells me that it ain't never gonna happen
And then my defenses say I did't want it anyway
But you know sometimes I'm a liar

Could you ever want me to love you?
Could you ever want me to care?
Disregard my nervousness, please ignore my vacant stares
'Cause just what I've been through is nothing like where I'm going to
Give me some sign to pursue a promise
And you're unhappy -- this is only a guess

Do you know what it's like to hate when it's way down deep inside?
Oh, God, I hate what's been done to my life
I could rule the pain, I could rule the night
Or would I ruin my salvation?
Ruin my mind, rules your pains, rulers of the night
Ruin your salvation, ruin your mind

You know that I want your loving
But my logic tells me that it ain't never gonna happen
And then my defences say I didn't want it anyway
But you know sometimes I'm a liar

Could you ever want me to love you?
Could you ever want me to care?
Disregard my nervousness, please ignore my vacant stares
'Cause just what I've been through is nothing like where I'm going to
Give me some sign to pursue a promise
And you're unhappy -- this is only a guess

// To The Kill //

Ain't had no fun, all the time jacking around
Ain't had no fun, messing my mind, I kick it around
But if it's all right with you, and if it's all right, yes, I will
Aw, c'mon, babe, go ahead to the kill

I ain't no kid in Chicago, I ain't no Al Capone
But there's a windy city in my bedroom alone
I said I don't live in Chicago, I don't know no Al Capone
That bitch took my money, and she went to Chicago
If I ain't already enough, sick and alone...
But if it's all right with you, and if it's all right, yes, I will
Aw, c'mon, babe, go ahead to the kill

Ain't had no fun, all the time jacking around
Ain't had no fun -- where's it at? It's down, down, it's downtown...
But if it's all right with you, and if it's all right, yes, I will
Aw, c'mon, babe, go ahead to the kill

// Gone Daddy Gone //

Beautiful girl, lovely dress
High school smiles, oh yes
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
Where she is now I can only guess

'Cause it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone away

When I see you, eyes will turn blue
When I see you, thousand eyes turnin' blue

'Cause it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone away

Tell by the way that you switch and walk
I can see by the way that you baby-talk
I can know by the way you treat your man
I can love you, baby, 'til it's a-cryin...

'Cause it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone away

Beautiful girl, lovely dress
Fifteen smiles, oh, yes
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
Where she is now, I can only guess 'cause it's...

// Good Feeling //

Good feeling, won't you stay with me just a little longer?
It always seems like you're leaving when I need you here just a little longer
Dear lady, there's so many things that I have come to fear
Little voice says I'm going crazy to see all my worlds disappear
Vague sketch of a fantasy laughing at the sunrise like he's been up all night
Ooh, slipping and sliding, what a good time but now, I have to find a bed that can take this weight

Good feeling, won't you stay with me just a little longer?
It always seems like you're leaving when I know the other one just a little too well
Oh, dear lady, won't you stay with me just a little longer?
You know it always seems like you're leaving when I need you here just a little longer

// Ugly //

Crossed the path, then I followed your face
It was hard to believe, it was hard to trace
I saw you today, seems like I see your everyday
But there's something I figured out 'bout you...

You're so ugly -- I'm tellin' you straight
You're so ugly -- don't make a mistake
'Cause you ugly -- you can bet it on the bank
Say, why, why, why would I lie to you?
Why would I lie? Why would I lie?

You're so ugly -- all the time
You're so ugly -- you ain't no friend of mine
'Cause you ugly -- you can bet it on the bank
Say, why, why, why would I lie to you?
Why would I lie? Why would I lie?

When you smile or a frown, I'm so tired of you being around
Engaged in some sexual acts, well, I'm just gonna have to tell you all the facts
What could that be about, well, here's a clue...

You're so ugly -- I'm tellin' you straight
You're so ugly -- don't make a mistake
'Cause you ugly -- I'm tellin' you that
Say, why, why, why would I lie to you?
Why would I lie? Why would I lie?

You're so ugly -- all the time
You're so ugly -- you ain't no friend of mine
'Cause you ugly -- you can bet it on the bank
Say, why, why, why would I lie to you?
Why would I lie? Why would I lie?

You're so ugly -- a-la, la, la, la...
You're so ugly...

// Gimme The Car //

Come on, dad, gimme the car tonight
Come on, dad, gimme the car tonight
I got this girl, I wanna...
Come on, dad, gimme the car

Come on, dad, gimme the car tonight
I tell'ya what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna pick her up
I'm gonna get her drunk
i'm gonna make her cry
I'm gonna get her high
I'm gonna make her laugh
I'm gonna make her... shh...

Woman, woman, woman
I know she's it
'Cause I'm gonna touch her all over her body
Gonna touch her all over her body
Gonna touch her all over her body
Gonna touch her all over her body
And she can touch me all over my body
She can touch me all over my body
She can touch me all over my body
She can touch me all over my body

Time goes by, I can feel myself growing old
Burning inside, it's making this boy turn out cold

What's wrong, what's right, I don't care when I hate my life
What's wrong, what's right, you know, people don't care when they hate their life
But how can I explain personal pain, how can I explain personal pain
How can I explain my voice is in vain, how can I explain the deep down
Driving, driving, driving, we're driving, we're driving, we're driving...

Hey, dad, speaking of driving...
Come on, dad, gimme the car tonight
So much he don't understand
Just might never make it to a man

Come on, dad, gimme the car
Come on, dad, I ain't no runt...
Come on, girl, gimme your...

'Cause I ain't had much to live for
I ain't had much to live for
You know I ain't had much to live for
You know I ain't had much to live for
