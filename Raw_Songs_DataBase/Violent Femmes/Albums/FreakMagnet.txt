// I Danced //

I danced before I had two feet
Sang before I had a tongue. 
I laughed before I had two eyes. 
Loved before my heart was young. 
I swam before I had two hands 
and held the distance in my toes. 
Before I heard the stars I knew 
the wild compulsion of the rose. 
I bore the fruits of many lies. 
Before I came into this day. 
I knew before my grave was made, 
the worms eat only death away 
I danced before I had two feet

// Hollywood Is High //

Hollywood is high
Hollywood is high
Hollywood is high

Hollywood is high
Sunset's low
All the wood is dry
No place to go
Hollywood is high
Sunset's low
Cars all pass by
With no place to go

And I don't wanna have fun
Fun always lets me down
And I don't wanna stay young
And always be just hangin' round

Sir where do they sell this magazine?
Calculation to excite
And sir you can tell it's not obscene
Penetration in black and white

And I don't wanna look
Lookin' always let me down
And all the paths he forsook
Only left him hangin' round

L.A.
From the valley to the shore
It's OK
But I don't want nothing from you anymore

Hollywood is high
Sunset's low
Do not ask why
Thomas Guide says so

And I don't wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna have fun
Fun it always lets me down
And I don't wanna stay young
You know I'd be just be hangin' 'round

Hollywood is high
Hollywood is high
Hollywood is high
Hollywood is high

// Freak Magnet //

Some magnet attract
Some magnets repel
Some magnets say:
Hey hey what the hell
I'll take it both ways
First you come and then you go
And hen you turn around
And P.A.Y.S.
It stays yes it stays no
I don't know what you're doin' here
I don't even want you near
Seem like a seem like a (uhhh...)
I'm a I'm a
I'm a freak magnet
I'm a freak magnet
I'm a freak magnet
I'm a freak magnet
And I'm callin' all the freaks
From the freak freak planet
I'm a freak magnet
Well the birds of a feather
Will fly and flock together
And the letter will come whether
It's good or bad weather
There's a cut on my knees
Cause I need to freeze
And there's a cord on my coat
Cause I neeed to cut the rope
And you're talkin' like sleeze
And you're lookin' like disease
Seem like a seem like a (uhhh...)
I'm a I'm a
I'm a freak magnet
I'm a freak magnet
I'm a freak magnet
I'm a freak magnet
And I'm callin' all the freaks
From the freak freak planet
I'm a freak magnet
I don't wanna date you ooo
I don't wanna rape you ooo
I don't wanna kiss you ooo
I will never miss you
because
Some magnet repel
And some magnets attract
And some magnets retreat
And then attack attack attack
I want it both ways
First I come and then I go
And you're the one of us who pays
Who says yes? I say no!

// Sleepwalkin' //

Someone sucked me 
late last evening
And it was time to make a change 
And i Wonder 
am i too late
am i too far a strange
For what i have been doin for all of these years
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'

I have so few good memories
somethings terably wrong
As a singer singing badly
As he tries to sing the wrong song
Look what i have been doing all of these years
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'
Something moving in the light
Something spoke to me and said "go, go, go, go"
Something's moving in the house show
Something to show 
For what ive been doing for all of these years
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'

Someone sucked me 
late last evening
And it was time to make a change 
And i Wonder 
am i too late
am i too far a strange
For what i have been doin for all of these years
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'

// All I Want //

All I want is to talk to you
All I want is to talk to you
I'm achin' for your touch
I'm breakin' cause I miss you so much
Do you miss me, too?

All I want is to walk with you
All I want is to walk with you
I'm hopin' for your kiss
I'm dopin' cause I miss you so much
Do you miss me, too?

Little bit closer, little bit closer, someday
When I try to get closer, then you move away

And all I want to say is all I want is to be with you
All I want is to be with you
You're hurting deep inside
You're flirting cause you need to feel that you are still alive

Little bit closer, little bit closer, someway
When I try to get closer, then you move away

And all I want to say is all I want is to walk with you
All I want is to talk with you
I'm prayin' for one night
I'm layin' so low cause I love you so though I know it ain't right

// In The Dark //

he's in the dark
night is his friend
he's on a mission that can never end
he has a hart that was broke long ago
he has more women than you'll ever know

hi daddy hi daddy hi daddy ho
hey daddy hi daddy no one will know
no one will know

he has a laughter and he has the fame
gets what he's after and wins the last game
knows how to kiss and he knows how to fly
his life at risk but he never will die,

hey daddy ho daddy hey daddy hi
hey daddy ho daddy never will die
never will die

what does he get out of playing his game
life of regret and a mother's shame
when he is done and his task it is through
his race is won and is completed too
then to unwind with a close friend or two
ask not for me but he'll give it to you

hey daddy ho daddy hi daddy who
hey daddy ho he will give it to you,
give it to you

he's in the dark and the night is his friend
he's on a mission that can never end

// Rejoice And Be Happy //

Rejoice and be happy when they revile you, just like the Savior told us to do.
Rejoice and be glad when for His name's sake, they speak all manner of evil and against you they hate.

Blessed are you who are persecuted too, for righteousness and the good that you do,
if in the bread you put a little leaven, the Kingdom is yours and it's the Kingdom of Heaven.

Rejoice and be happy when they revile you, just like the Savior told us to do.
Rejoice and be glad when for His name's sake, they speak all manner of evil and against you they hate.

Ye are the salt of the earth, if you're not salty, what are you worth?

Rejoice and be ye exceedingly glad for great is the reward in Heaven to be had
for the prophets they did persecute too, unjust though it was, they came way before you.

Rejoice and be happy when they revile you, just like the Savior told us to do.
Rejoice and be glad when for His name's sake, they speak all manner of evil and against you they hate.

We are the salt of the earth, if we're not salty, what are we worth?

Rejoice and be happy when they revile you, just like the Savior told us to do.
Rejoice and be glad when for His name's sake, they speak all manner of evil and against you they hate.

Rejoice and be happy when they revile you, just like the Savior told us to do.
Rejoice and be glad when for His name's sake, they speak all manner of evil and against you they hate.

// Forbidden //

come with us and play!
see, we have breasts as women!
from your tents by the sea
come play with us: it is forbidden

come with us and play!
lo, bare, straight legs in the water!
by our boats we stay
then swimming away
come to us: it is forbidden!

come with us and play!
see, we are as tall as women!
our eyes are keen:
our hair is bright:
our voices speak outright:
we revel in the sea's green!
come play: it is forbidden!

// When You Died //

I quit thinking about killing myself
when you died
just for a day or two
i must have wanted to
just for a day or two
I must have wanted to live

I quit believing these lies I tell myself
when you died
just for a day or two
I must have wanted to
just for a day or two
I must have wanted the truth

I will always love you my friend
now that you died
but just for a day or two
I'd like to be with you
just for a day or two
I'd like to have you alive

// At Your Feet //

At your feet would fall many kings
At your feet will fall many things
At your hands I'd kiss every one of your rings
And this song in silence sings... my love

At your feet I'd kiss every one of your cool toes
My dumb heart is not as smart as what a fool knows
At your kiss I'd curse everyone
For my bad luck I wish but to whisper
"I love you" but I will not not fuck up your life

At your feet will fall many tears
And your hands will form many fears
Before your face will pace many a peer
I'm the one who comes but to disappear
And reappear oh my dear
I want you near... here

At your feet would fall many queens
At your feet the willow tree leans
And my love will follow you there
Lightning strikes but I don't know where

Is my love
I love you
All my life

// I'm Bad //

bad bad bad bad bad
bad bad bad bad bad
bad bad bad bad
I was bas born
I'd be badder when I die
I'm bad when I am sober
I'm badder when I'm high
I'm when I feel good
I'm bad when I'm blue
I'm bad to myself
So I'll be bad to you
So I'll be bad to you
I should've been good
Look at the trouble I've had
I would if I could
But I'm just bad
bad bad bad bad bad
bad bad bad bad
I'm, bad and I'm alive
I'll be badder when I'm dead
I'm bad in my body
man I'm badder in the head
I'm bad in the bed
Something wrong from the start
Guilt in my mind
Evil in my heart
Evil in my heart
I don't need to be happy
I don't care if I'm sad
I don't care about nothin'
Cause I'm bad bad bad bad bad
bad bad bad bad
Don't lend me a dollar
Don't lend me a dime
Don't lend me your wife
She'll have a good time
I'm bad in my car
I'm badder when I'm home
I'm bad when I'm with you
And I'm badder all alone
I'm a low down worm
I'm a conquering worm
I'm a blood-suckin' worm
I'm a slime baitin' worm
I'll put you on the hook
And I'll watch you squirm
I could never learn
Any young turks new tricks
I could never learn
Not to kick against the pricks
Things go from bad to worse
Sometimes it makes me glad
That I was born
Under the Curse of being bad bad bad bad bad
bad bad bad bad
Don't lend me a dollar
Don't lend me dime,
Don't lend me your wife
She'll have a good time
Don't lend me a twenty,
Don't lend me a ten,
If you lend me a hundread
You'll never see me again
What I would do
These are the very things I don't do
And what I would not do
Those are the things that i do
Who shall deliver from this body of death
It's not Muhammed
And it's not Seth
I tried to be happy
But it onyl made me sad
I wanted to be good
But I'm just bad bad bad bad bad
bad bad bad bad bad
bad bad bad bad bad
bad bad bad

// Happiness Is //

I don't know what one means by happy
I'm happy spasmodically
If I eat a chocolate turtle I'm happy
When the box is empty I'm unhappy
When I get another box
I'm happy again
Happiness is a word for amatures

// A Story //

I got a story
A sad sad story
About a girl
Who met a boy
About her mother
Whose vision saw her
Daughter to marry
Another boy
(Nooo nooo nooo...)
They made a plan
To get away
To run away
And though it be hard
To make that day
Freely to live
Without the mother
They'd send a postcard
(Nooo nooo nooo...)
Out on the interstate
That's where they made their mistake
That's where they met their fate
Out on the interstate
They met a monster
The monster of the interstate
Who will not hesitate
Who eats teenagers
Like a shark eats little fishes
Who eats bad kids disobeying parents wishes
An interloper against the elopers
A troll at the pay toll
They stopped at the toll booth
And reached for a quarter
The monster filled the whole booth
He gave them no quarter
"Don't eat me"
Chirped the girl
Clutching to her purse
"Don't eat me"
Croaked the boy
"Or eat her first
I'll turn right around
And take her back to her mother's
We repent of being out of wedlock lovers"
"You should have thought of that before"
And a scaly horny hand
Ripped the car lock door
And the boy
Tried to drive
But oh boy
He was eaten alive
And the girl
Tried to scream
But she was swirled
In the giant's vanilla ice cream
And the boy was yummy
And the girl was yummy
As they slid down the throat
To the monster's yellow tummy
He said:
"Hmm hmm good
Didn't do like they should
Hmm hmm good
Didn't do like they should"
The mother sold the
Rights to the story
It was so scary
This gory story
They made a movie
A horror movie
The mother made a million
And the producers made a billion
"And that other sweet boy
That my daughter has shunned
Now I'm his wife and he's my husband"
The moral of this story
Is clear for all to see
And if clearly all can see
Then it isn't clear to me
