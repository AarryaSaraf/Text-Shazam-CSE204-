// 12 Steps //

I think I'm powerless over this.
Only a power greater than me
could store my synergy.

I took my will into no will but thy will.
Made a moral inventory of my moral story.

One step, two step, three step, four.
Five, sex, seven, on the eighth step, more.
Nine step, ten step, eleven step twelve.
Only twelve step get me out of hell.

I was wrong, I say to myself.
And I say to everybody else.
My character needs a caretaker.
Under God.
Who would remove my shortcomings and my highgoings.
I made a list of everyone I dissed and pissed on.
And I will make amends to correct this.

One step, two step, three step, four.
Five, sex, seven, on the eighth step, more.
Nine step, ten step, eleven step twelve.
Only twelve step get me out of hell.

T-W-E-L-V-E S-T-E-P-S

I will do it directly unless this causes injury.
I will admit to be full of shit as soon as I'm aware of it.
Seek through prayer and meditation to keep God in communication.
Now my spirit is week, I say wake up in love and go to sleep in hate.

One step, two step, three step, four.
Five, sex, seven, on the eighth step, more.
Nine step, ten step, eleven step twelve.
Only twelve step get me out of hell.

I am getting powerless over this.
I have become powerless over this.
I have become powerless over this.

// 36-24-36 //

36-24-36!

See a girl walkin' down the street, just the kind of girl that I'd like to meet.
It ain't her hair, her clothes, her feet -- somethin' much more discreet.
Now I ain't loud, baby, I ain't proud -- I just want what I'm not allowed.
Movin' on up and I help myself to do a world of good for my mental health.

36-24-36 -- something's broken that needs to be fixed.
I don't know how to tell you this, 
But I'm getting bored and I need some kicks like 36-24-36.

Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man -- I got a red hot plan if you understand.
Cannot fail, it's plain to see -- I'm havin' fun and makin' money.
I know this summer's gonna be the best if I don't die from lack of rest.
Experience what my daddy said, that's what I got, just like he said.

36-24-36 -- something was broke but I got it fixed.
I don't know if I should tell you this,
But I was gettin' bored and I got my kicks like 36-24-36.

Something's special 'bout her personality,
Something's special 'bout her psysiology.

36-24-36 -- I want lots of pretty chicks.
36-24-36 -- I want lots of pretty chicks.
36-24-36 -- I want lots of pretty chicks.
36-24-36 -- I want lots of...

// America Is //

America is
America is the home of the hypocrite
America is the home of the hypocrite
America is the home of the hypocrite
American dream, so full of it

Look at the Indians, look at the blacks
Look at the figures, look at the facts
Look at the facts, the facts, not the lies
When you find out -- big surprise

That America is the home of the hypocrite
America is the home of the hypocrite
America is the home of the hypocrite
American dream, so full of it

Check out the Indians, check out the blacks
And then you check out the figures, and then you check out the facts
Just check out some facts, check out the facts, not the lies
Then you'll find out, it's a big surprise right between the eyes

America is the home of the hypocrite
America is the home of the hypocrite
America is the home of the hypocrite
American dream is only a dream

No desperation limit, new desperation level
Even though my nose don't work
I smell trouble, I smell trouble
No desperation limit, new desperation level
Murder, murder in the government
Say you're sorry, say you're sorry
No desperation limit, new desperation level
Turn the key, turn the lock
Nationalism, you can suck my
No desperation limit, new desperation level
Watch how the world's progressin' everywhere
Aggression, aggression
Aggression, aggression
Aggression, aggression

// Color Me Once //

Color me once, color me twice
Everything gonna turn out nice
Everlasting arms, you gotta keep me from these false alarms

Alarm, alarm I see you so sad
Maybe I see you, I'm glad
Maybe maybe the fire of her desire

Patience, patience, said the man
Patience, patience, I can't understand
Patience like a man and a wife
I got patience on my neck like a cold cold knife

I say Jack be nimble, Jack fall dead
Jack bend over and give Jilly head
Oh you gotta help my body heal my soul

Dead men working a sinner, a saint
Mixing up a pail of paint
Painted the house, black as night
When the sun came up the house was white

Gotta go on, gotta go on
We gotta go on, you gotta go on
You gotta go on
Go on
Go on

We gotta go on, you gotta go on
You gotta go on

// I Hate The TV //

I hate the TV
I hate the TV
I hate the TV
I hate the TV
Y'know that it's killing me
Y'know that it's killing me

I hate the president
I hate the president
I hate the president
I hate the president
Y'know that he's killing me
Y'know that he's killing me

Oh my love
Do not fear
Satan's army will never win
Oh my love

Do not despair
God is with us
Living prayer
He's killing me
He's killing me

// Love Love Love Love Love //

Step one, I did it for fun
It was a simple way to start
Lights out, what's it all about?
I only got one cheek to turn

Some do it for the summit la cumbre
Some do it for the climb
Some people know when to settle down
Me, I can't help but wonder what's on the other side

I want love love love love love
Love love love love love
Love love love love love
All around me
All around me

Step two led to step three
Led to my heading home in a rush
Some kid won't admit what he did
Just say, "Hey Hail Mary, can't forgive and forget about it"

Some say they know it when they see it
While others follow it blind
Some science appliances made it all calculated
It's just a chemical imbalance in the weaker mind

I want love love love love love
Love love love love love
Love love love love love
All around me
All around me

Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooooh
I know something you don't know
I said, hey hey hey hu-hu-hey hey
I'm not ever gonna give it away
I said, oh-oh-oh-oh-ooooh
I know something you don't know
I said, hey hey hey hu-hu-hey hey
I'm not ever gonna give it away

Step one, I did it for fun
It was a simple way to start
Some doors don't close anymore
Once you have opened up your heart

Some people gotta sell it
'Cause some people wanna pay
Some people like to stand on a steeple and tell me,
"This is not the way, it's the wrong way!"

I want love love love love love
Love love love love love
Love love love love love
All around me
All around me

Love love love love love
Love love love love love
Love love love love love
All around me
All around me

// Me And You //

Me, me and you
That's what I want, that's what I want
You, you and me
That's what I need, that's what I need

Oh, but something, something, something, something
Something, something, something always
Mess me up, man, I'm messing up, I'm messing up
And nothing, nothing gonna keep me from your loving
'Cause I, I love you too too much to tell you something else but

Me, me and you
That's what I want, that's what I want
You, you and me
That's what I need, that's what I need
When, when we went
That is when you will be, yeah
You, you and me
Then we'll be happy

Oh, but something, something, something, something
Something, something, something always
Mess me up, man, I'm messing up, I'm messing up
And nothing, nothing gonna keep me from your loving
'Cause I, I love you too much to tell you what I

Me, me and you
That's what I want, that's what I want
You, you and me
That's what I need, that's what I need
You and me, happy
You will be, happy
You and me, happy

// My Way //

And now the end is near.
And so I face the final curtain.
My friend, I'll say it clear.
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.
I've lived a life that's full.
I traveled ewach and every highway.
And more, much more than this:  I did it my way.

Regrets--I've had a few.
But then again, too few to mention.
I did what I had to do.
I saw it through without exemption.
I plan each charted course,
Each careful step along the byway.
And more, much more than this, I did it my way.

Yes there were times,
I'm sure you knew,
When I bit off
More than I could chew.
But through it all, when there was doubt,
I ate it up and spit it out.
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way.

I've loved,
I've laughed and cried.
I had my fill, my share of losing.
And now as tears subside,
I find it all so amusing.
To think I did all that,
And may I say, not in a sly way.
Oh no, oh no not me, I did it my way.

Oh what is a man?
What has he got?
If not himself, then he has not.
To say the things he truly feels.
And not the words of one who kneels.
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way.

// Raquel //

Raquel.
I am not well.
Raquel.

And if I was a bell,
I wish that you'd ring it.
And if I had something to tell
I could not unless I could sing it.

Raquel.
I am not well.

And if I was a ball,
I wish that you'd bounce it.
And if I give you a telephone call,
Oh baby, please don't announce it.
Don't announce it.

Raquel.
I am not well.
Raquel.

What is this feeling
that I'm not trying to squelch?
I don't know your last name,
I just know it's not Welch.

Raquel.
You always cast a spell.

And if I was a ghost,
I wish that you'd haunt me.
But what I'd really like the most
is baby, baby--that you want me.

What is this feeling 
that I'm not trying to hide?
I feel no shame 
but I feel no pride.

Raquel.
It's a color call from hell.

And if you had a brain,
I think that you'd diss me.
But if you was really insane,
Oh baby, baby--could you kiss me?
Could you kiss me?

Raquel.
I am not well.
Raquel.

Raquel.
I am unwell.
Raquel.

// Something's Wrong //

Something's wrong.
Why don't you tell me about it?
Something's wrong?
Why don't you let it out?
It will help me to help you
to help me to touch you.
But you're already gone.
Something's wrong.
I don't know what it is.
Something's wrong.
It's my problem, yes it is.
Because I want to touch you.
And I want you so much 
you don't even know.
Call me back, baby.
Call me back.
You can call me at any time.
Call me back, baby.
Call me back.
But don't you say everything's fine.
Because something's wrong.
And I see no help in view.
Something's wrong.
And I don't know what to do.
How can you love me to touch you?
And I want you so much
you don't even know.
Some day you'll want me too.
You'll want to touch so much.
But I'm already gone.
Something's wrong.

// Waiting For The Bus //

We got the mother and her kids
We got the guy and his date
We all get mad
We all get late
Looks like somebody forgot about us
Standing on the corner, waiting for the bus

Say hey mr. driver man, don't be slow
Cause i got somewhere i gotta go
Say hey mr. driver man, drive that thing fast
My precious time keeps slipping past

Let's call the mayor, let's complain
Looks like the city's done it to us again
Tied up in traffic, what do you know
The damn city bus, it moves so slow

Say hey mr. driver man, don't be slow
Cause i got somewhere i gotta go
Say hey mr. driver man, drive that thing fast
My precious time keeps slipping past

[*talking, instrumental*]

// Yes, Oh Yes //

I know a woman who can hardly speak.
The feeling is so strong, and the foreman becomes weak.
It took one sentence to finish in a week.
I said "Yes, oh yes."
I said "This is what I've been waiting for."

I know a place where nothing can grow.
The summer will burn and the winter will snow.
And nothing moves but the wind, it blows.
It says "Yes, oh yes."
It says "This is what you've been homesick for."

I want to learn all the languages of man.
And question the wisdom in the maker's plan.
To babble on in our caravan
Where we say, "Yes, oh yes."
We said, "This is why we're not fighting.  Oh."

You take me by my hand and say,
That what I owe I can not repay,
But you still love me anyway.
And I said "Yes, oh yes."
I said "This is what I've been dying...Yes, oh yes!
This is what I've been crying for.  Yes, oh yes.
This is what I've been waiting for."
