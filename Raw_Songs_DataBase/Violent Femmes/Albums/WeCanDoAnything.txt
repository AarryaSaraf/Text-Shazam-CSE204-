Album: WeCanDoAnything

// Memory //

Don't remember anything you said
I don't remember any books that you have ever read
I don't remember the sound of your voice
I don't remember but it's not by choice

So I wish I could remember something you said
I wish that I could read every book that you ever have read
I wish I could hear the sound of your voice
I don't remember but it's now your choice

To come back from that well of a void
Come back so that I could tell you how I'm annoyed

By the fact that I can't remember your smile or your frown
I can't remember the name of your hometown
I don't remember the color of your eyes
I don't remember so hey, I guess it's a little surprise

That I want to will you wonder would you wander back from where you are
You see I see I can not see but I come so far with a little guitar
That I play in bars and I'm lost in stars

Memory

Oh, come back from that well of a void
Come back so that I could tell you how I'm annoyed
Because come so far with a little guitar
That I play in bars and I'm lost in stars

Memory

// I Could Be Anything //

Oh, I could be this or I could be that
I could pull an elephant out of a hat
I could slay a dragon or I could be a king
I could be anything

I am at occidental in the land of dragon's breath
Where they are not ornamental but are real as life or death
Where they terrorize the populists, the people point with fear
For dragons have no thoughtfulness, their egos are severe

My name is Bongo and I may be small
I am the bravest man of them all
I'll fight the fearful dragon, I'll kill him with my sword
I always fight big dragons, especially when I'm bored

I met him in the open to fight him fair and square
His mouth he held wide open, putrefying the air
He blazed such fearful fires, people thought I was dead
But my courage engine fires and I chopped off his head

Oh, I could do this or I could do that
I could pull an elephant out of a hat
I could slay a dragon or I could be a king
I could do anything

The people they all cheered and they gave out quite a whoop
For the dragon they had feared had been turned to dragon poop
We partied all day and we partied all night
They held a royal festival where the king made me a knight

Thy name was Bongo but that no more shall stay
You once were simply Bongo but now my Knight today
Sir Bongo, I now dub thee
Sir Bongo for all eternity
Thy name shall be Sir Bongo

The following peace and devotional was solemn and sublime
The king got all emotional and he said "All I have is Thine
Take my only daughter, the princess fair
And with all my treasure you'll make a royal pair
She's so beautiful and so true, she will be your bride
To have a son-in-law like you would give me great pride
And now I can begin with my retirement plan
Now I know the kingdom rests in your sure hands"

Now from the mountains to the plains, the Mississippi to the Congo
The whole world knows the name of the of the g-g-g-good King Bongo
Now from the mountains to the plains, Mississippi to the Congo
The whole world knows the name of the of the great Sir King Bongo
The great King Bongo

I could do this or I could be that
I could pull an elephant out of a hat
I could slay a dragon or I could be a king
I could do anything

Oh, I could do this or I could do that
I could put that elephant right back in his hat
I could slay a dragon or I could be a king
I could be anything
I could be anything
I could be anything

Bongo

// Issues //

Why you coming round?
Why you coming here?
You tell me that I'm worthless as I turn to get us a beer
You're living at the top
I'm dying underneath
I don't need anyone at my grave laying their wreath
So don't insist

You tried to tell me 'bout your issues
I don't need to know about them anymore
Your issues
And why you're standing in my kitchen door
I don't want to talk about it
I don't care
But what's that glistening in your stare?

They say the world is round
Will you have another beer?
Killing time all the time isn't what brings you here 
Life is at the top
Death is underneath
So I don't want anyone digging up from beneath
Darling, insist[?]

Do not tell me about your issues
Oh god you're gonna talk about them more and more
I'll get some tissues
Cause soon you'll be crying on my kitchen floor
I don't need to talk about it I don't care
But what's this hovering in the air?

How can you be so cruel?
How am I just a fool?

Cause I'm glad you came around
So good you stopped by here
It was really pointless but it proved to bring us more near
Now you're in the top 
And I am underneath
What the fuck's going on? I know this will bring us grief 
But I can't resist

You and your issues
I wish I didn't have to hear them anymore
But they're your issues
So now as were lying on my kitchen floor
Go ahead and talk about it I don't care 
While I'm running my fingers all through your hair

// What You Really Mean //

I seen you treat love as a simple mark
Caught up in moments of electric spark
Step inside just as you leave your mark
Defenseless

But sometimes when you look at me
In the darkness of your eyes, I see
What you really mean

Tell me lovers play a fickle game
A broken heart's just another name
For wounded pride in a war of lame
Pretenses 

But sometimes when you look at me
In the darkness of your eyes I see
What you really mean

Wonder of what can I be denied 
You pay the toll and you take the ride
You give it all or else you haven't tried
You don't lay, halfway

Dreams not asked for I see right through you
There's not much difference in the things that we do
I know you better than you want me to
But still

Sometimes when you look at me
In the darkness of your eyes I see 
What you really mean

Wonder of what can I be denied
You pay the toll and you take the ride
You give it all or else you haven't tried
You don't lay, halfway [x2]

I know there's some things that you can't erase
I shake my head as I watch you chase
From place to place, so as not to face 
The chances

That sometimes when you look at me 
In the darkness of my eyes you'll see
What I really mean

What you really mean
(What you really mean) [x3]

// Foothills //

I know why I go to work
And I know sometimes I'm a jerk
But I can't tell you why
I'm in love

I'll take lunch with my co-workers
But after work I just go bezerkers 
Yet I can't tell them why
I'm in love

Sundays and Saturdays
Sitting in the park, or in the dark, or at the beach
In the foothills 
My thoughts, they keep straying out of reach
Say it's left or say it's right
Say it's day or say it's night
Still I can't tell you why
I'm in love

I wake up and then I jerk 
My brain awake
But it won't work 
Well enough to say why I'm 
In love

So I get up and then I jerk
And then I get up and then I go to work
But I can't say why I'm
In love

All the days are happy days
Sitting in the park, or in the dark, or at the beach
In the foothills
My thoughts, they keep staying out of reach
Say it's wrong or say it's right
Say we may or say we might 
Still I can't tell you why I'm in love

I know I will feel the hurt
And I know that it doesn't hurt
And I know you know that I'm in love

I get up and I go to work
I can say my boss is a jerk 
But I can't tell you why
I'm in love

// Traveling Solves Everything //

If you have a problem
Just get in the car and drive
Drive, drive, drive so you never get back
Drive, drive, drive you'll be so glad you did that
Just get in the car and drive

If you have a problem 
Just get on the bus and ride
Ride, ride, ride 'til you never get back
Ride, ride, ride you'll be so glad you did that
Just get on the bus and ride 

If your life unravels,
Make a plan and travels

If you have a problem
Just get in a tree and glide
Glide, glide, glide 'til you never get back
Glide, glide, glide you'll be so glad you did that
Just get in the tree and glide

Traveling solves everything 
Traveling's a blessed thing

When you have a problem 
Just get on the plane and fly
Fly, fly, fly 'til you never come back
Fly, fly, fly you'll be so glad you did that
Just get on the plane and fly

If your life unravels
Make a plan and travels

When you have a problem
Don't sit where you are and stew
Stew, stew, stew 'til you never get through
Stew, stew, stew 'til they're coming for you
Don't sit where you are stew

Because traveling solves everything
That's why traveling's a blessed thing
So if your life unravels
Just make a plan and travels

(Make a plan and travels) [x5]

// Big Car //

Come on in my car
I got a big one
Come on, we will ride around
We'll go out where there is no one
See you when you're sinkin' down
Sinkin' down
Sinkin' down

Cruisin' all around your high school
All your girlfriends to impress
They think they know what we might do
But what we're doin'
They can only guess
Only guess
They can only guess

Oh when you wear that thing you wear
It ain't fair, it ain't right
Sweat on your lip and a tender hip
I gotta take - one - a little bitty bite oh baby

When exactly are your classes?
Which exactly do you wanna cut?
You look even better without your glasses
You been sleepin' your whole life
I'm gonna wake you up
Wake you up
Wake you up

She's just a teenage tart
But she moved right into my heart

Oh when you do that thing you do
It ain't good, it's the best
A tender kiss and I'll tell you this
That in my hand there's a little swelling

Come on in my car
I got a big one
Come on, we will ride around
We'll go out where there is no one
And baby your body will not be
Found
It will not be found
It will not be found

// I'm Not Done //

Because I failed, because I tried
Because I wailed, because I cried
Because I lived and died
I have done all these things plus some
And with all these things I'm not done

We came together, we broke apart
We broke each other In mind and heart
It has ended, it will not restart

We have done all of this plus some
And with all of this we're not done
I'm not done, I'm not through yet
My heart won't let my mind forget

I was wild in the sight of God
I spared the child, I spoiled the rod
Remember once you smiled the angels trod

We have done all of this plus some
And with all of this you're not done
You're not done, You're not through yet
Your hate won't let your heart forget
And I'm not done, I'm not through yet
My mind can't let go on regret

Because I failed and when I tried
Cause I wailed when I cried
Cause I lived when I died

I have done all these things plus some
And with all of this I'm not done
I have done so much plus some
And with all these things I'm not done
