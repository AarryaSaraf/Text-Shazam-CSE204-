// Living A Lie //

I'm living a lie because I can't tell the truth.
There's a fire in the basement,
a fire on the roof.
I'm just sitting in my chair wearing a smile.
I'm going to vanish in the air after awhile.
Did did you get the news that I'm lost at sea
Hey, hey somebody's confused though it couldn't be me.
I wasn't near that place.
I don't know where it was.
She didn't see my face.
You know its true because
I know wise things.
I know about these things.
I know why it is caged,
so I don't know why I'm enraged.

I'm lying about my birth and I'm lying about my death.
For all I'm worth, I lie with every breath.
Lying homes are built on my crying habitations.
Here's the milk that I spilt,
my undying lamitations
I know about these things, I know about these things
I know why it is caged,
so I don't know why I'm enraged.

Always the bride's maid, never the bride.
Look what my bride's made, out of my life.
Always the bride's maid, never the bride.
Look what your bride's made, you shook my life.
Always the bride's maid, never the bride.
Look what your bride's made, and you know, you shouldn't have lied.

// Tonight //

Tonight, I want to get high, high, high. 
I don't care if I live or die. 
Tonight, cause I want to get high. 
Tonight, I want to get drunk, drunk, drunk. 
I'm big enough, yeah I'm a punk! 
Tonight, cause I want to get drunk, 
but it would be much better if we do it together. 
Tonight, cause I want to get laid. 
Tonight, I want to get laid, laid, laid. 
I dont care if it is good grade. 
Tonight, cause I want to get laid. 
Tonight, cause I want to get fucked. 
Tonight, I want to get fucked, fucked, fucked. 
Do me slow, do it in'a trunk 
Tonight, cause I want to get fucked. 
but it would be much better if we could do it together. 
Tonight, I want to get high, high, high. 
I don't care if I live. 
Tonight.

// Bad Dream //

They're supposed to be here by now. 
What the hell is taking them so long? 
I parked the car just like they said. 
Now, I'm sitting, waiting for a bullet in my head. 
I'm living in a bad dream gone bad. 
I'm living in a bad dream that's sad. 
I'm supposed to be feeling better by now. 
What the hell is taking me so long? 
I hit the hay just like they said. 
Now, I'm sitting, waiting for a bell in my head. 
I'm living in a bad dream gone bad. 
I'm living in a bad dream that's sad. 
On a curve, lost control. 
On a cliff, lost control. 
This is not happening to me. 
I say so. 
I'm supposed to be a better person by now. 
What the hell is taking me so long? 
Dying saviors off sum cross. 
Now, I'm hoping and I'm praying that they'll nullify my losses. 
I'm living in a bad dream gone bad. 
I'm living in a bad dream that's sad. 
I'm living in a bad dream gone bad. 
I'm living in a bad dream that's sad. 
I'm living in a bad dream.

// Thanksgiving (No Way Out) //

I see no way out.
I feel a closing in.
Living this way, I won't live this way.
Its no way to live.
I am not grateful.
I am hateful.
I see stupid things,
So I say stupid things.
One thing I know I want to go
Where my heart can't hurt no more.
I am not grateful.
I am hateful.

I am not grateful.
I am painful.

// Dahmer Is Dead //

Dahmer is Dead
Dahmer is Dead.
A broomstick bashed him upside his head.
Upside the head, upside the head.
Bloody broomstick.
Dahmer is dead.
Am I supposed to feel outrage?
Am I supposed to feel sorrow?
Jeffery Dahmer has no right tommorrow.
Dahmer is Dead
Dahmer is Dead
A broomstick bashed him upside his head.
Dahmer is Dead
Dahmer is Dead
Bloody broomstick.
Dahmer is Dead.
Along with a broomstick upside his head.
Along with broomstick.
Dahmer is dead.

// Life Is an Adventure //

Life is an adventure, 
made for an adventurer. 
Made just for the boy who can, 
grow up strong and become a man. 
Nothing will bother you, 
you will do what you want to. 
Laughes and loves and hopes and dreams, 
action will supply the means. 
Living for something. 
Foregiving nothing, 
and you're forgiving, nothing, 
cause you're living for something. 
Fast is fast, the sacred cow. 
Life is in the here and now. 
Got to dream and got to hope. 
Broaden your horizon scope. 
I told you once and I told you twice, 
Japanese eat lots of rice. 
You can be my assistant. 
It could be to you detriment. 
Ah we're believing something. 
Conceiving a great wealth. 
Conceiving nothing 
Believing in myself 
Life is an adventure, 
made for an adventurer. 
Made just for the boy who can, 
grow up strong and become a man.

// She Went To Germany //

What you gonna do on your vacation? 
What you gonna do for relaxation? 
Change you name? 
Cut your hair? 
You can go anywhere. 
You deserve some fun and rest. 
You deserve the very best. 
She went to Germany. 
Went there without me. 
She went to Germany. 
Left me in misery. 
She went to Germany. 
Gots some style insanity. 
She went to Germany. 
Left me in disharmony. 
Why you gonna do? 
Why you gonna do? 
Why you gonna do that to me baby? 
Are you telling me we're through? 
Are you telling me we're thru or is it maybe, 
just another declaration of some female independence, 
or another proclamation to some male friends in attendance. 
She went to Germany. 
Went there without me. 
She went to Germany. 
Left me in misery. 
She went to Germany. 
Gots some style insanity. 
She went to Germany. 
Left me in disharmony. 
She eating wurst. 
She's drinking beer. 
She loves a crowd, that's what I hear. 
She went to Germany. 
Went there without me. 
She went to Germany. 
Left me in misery. 
She went to Germany. 
Gots some style insanity. 
She went to Germany. 
Left me in disharmony. 
She went to Germany. 
Went there without me. 
She went to Germany. 
Left me in insanity. 
She went to Germany. 
I gots some style in misery. 
She went to Germany. 
Left me in disharmony.

// I Wanna See You Again //

I wanna se you again,
I don't care where and I don't care when. 
I wanna see you again, 
cause this beginning will have no end. 
Bring your whips, bring your chains. 
We can exchange names. 
I wanna see you again. 
I feel a feeling since I don't know when. 
I wanna see you again, 
so you can know you have a friend. 
You're so passive. 
I'm filled with wrath. 
We could take a bath. 
I wanna see you again. 
Oh, their's talk of the lights on broadway 
and hearts intwining high above, 
and if frankly we'll see things my way, 
we will climb the heights of love. 
I wanna see you again. 
It doesn't matter where or when. 
I wanna see you again. 
I'm just beginning to have no end. 
Perfect love. 
Cast out fear. 
Let me, buy you a beer. 
I wanna see you again, 
and again, 
I wanna see you again.

// Didgeriblues //

Once I knew a dude who blew the didgeridoo.
He knew a girl who he decided to woo to
under her balcony with a didgeridoo
and did she know you would do the digeridoo too,
if you knew she'd do, do the didgeridoo.
Then a baby came one day
and daddy would stay by the cradle to lay.
Cooche, cooche, coo.
Cooche, cooche, coo.
on his trusty didgeridoo.
and did she know you who do the digeridoo too,
if you knew she'd do, do the didgeridoo.
When A and R man heard that rumble,
he signed him up man, quiet little bundle.
Made a record in L. A.
where I here the people still will say,
damn, that cat, he really moved.
He knew what to do on the didgeridoo.
Now all over the world this song debuts,
its hitting the charts,
all number ones and number two's.
This song has swept the nations.
The didgeridooblues.
If that you would love it too,
if you could do the didgeridoo.
Now, if that she would love you too,
if she knew you could do the didgeridoo.
if she knew you could do the didgeridoo.
if she knew you who blew the didgeridoo.

// Death Drugs //

Long live the legend. 
Long live the legend. 
Long live the legend. 
It'll out live us. 
Aw mom, I need some long sleeved shirts. 
You got to get me some long sleeved shirts. 
Mom mom, I need some long sleeved shirts. 
You gotta hide the marks where I stick the works. 
The things we were doing got me under the rugs. 
We're doin' the death drugs. 
How come Bobby Dylan and Louie Reed 
They're never seen in short sleeves. 
Hey the sixties everybody's going to heaven. 
Sixty-nine, sixty-eight, sixty-seven. 
The things we were doing got me under the rugs. 
We be doing the death drugs. 
Long live the legend. 
It's not for everyone. 
Long live the legend. 
It's not for everyone. 
Long live the legend. 
It's not for everyone. 
Long live the legend. 
It's not for everyone. 
Long live the legend. 
Long live the legend. 
Long live the legend. 
It'll out live us.

// Sweet Worlds Of Angels //

I think that I would like to
stroll down a street or two.
Stop by some places that I know
and see whats become of me.
Stay close and comfort.
The winds that tear em up.
Now, they're breezing out to pasture
and I'm breezing in and out.
Flow, let it flow.
It's just so mellow under my pillow.
It's just so mellow I'm surrounded by pillows.
Don't feel afraid.
I'm a little out of sleep.
Just me come to call
With my frozen teeth and melted lips.
I will come and run to meet the sun
when my songs for the morning
and then I will smile upon you
with my peace and my yearning.
Flow, let if flow.
It,s just so mellow under my pillow.
It,s just so mellow I'm surrounded by pillows.
The sun was yellow.
Beneath the streaming through the trees. 
Clouds are great pillows
Floating so grandly above the trees
Why is everybody so hollow
So I kill everything.
Sweet worlds of angels. 
Sweet worlds of angels.
Sweet worlds of angels
Some never never never die die.
Sweet worlds of angels.
Some never never never die die.
Sweet worlds of angels.
Some never never never die die.
Beautiful angels.
Don't ever leave me behind.
Your all too perfuming of my life.
I think that I would like to
stroll down a street or two.
Stop by some places that I know
and see whats become of me.
