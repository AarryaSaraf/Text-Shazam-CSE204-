Some magnet attract
Some magnets repel
Some magnets say:
Hey hey what the hell
I'll take it both ways
First you come and then you go
And hen you turn around
And P.A.Y.S.
It stays yes it stays no
I don't know what you're doin' here
I don't even want you near
Seem like a seem like a (uhhh...)
I'm a I'm a
I'm a freak magnet
I'm a freak magnet
I'm a freak magnet
I'm a freak magnet
And I'm callin' all the freaks
From the freak freak planet
I'm a freak magnet
Well the birds of a feather
Will fly and flock together
And the letter will come whether
It's good or bad weather
There's a cut on my knees
Cause I need to freeze
And there's a cord on my coat
Cause I neeed to cut the rope
And you're talkin' like sleeze
And you're lookin' like disease
Seem like a seem like a (uhhh...)
I'm a I'm a
I'm a freak magnet
I'm a freak magnet
I'm a freak magnet
I'm a freak magnet
And I'm callin' all the freaks
From the freak freak planet
I'm a freak magnet
I don't wanna date you ooo
I don't wanna rape you ooo
I don't wanna kiss you ooo
I will never miss you
because
Some magnet repel
And some magnets attract
And some magnets retreat
And then attack attack attack
I want it both ways
First I come and then I go
And you're the one of us who pays
Who says yes? I say no!
