Old Mother Reagan and her crew took away from me and you! 
I hope she goes far away, she better go far away...
Y'know it ain't right when it's all wrong,
This is the Old Mother Reagan protest song. 
Old Mother Reagan -- she's so dumb! She's so dangerous!
How come she don't go far away, she better go far away...
Old Mother Reagan went to heaven, but at the pearly gates, she was stopped!
