Yeah I saw you walkin down the street
I could tell by your look that you didn't wanna meet
so this time
I went away
But next time
Im just gonna have to say
"Could I buy a dress or something?
Could I buy ya some jewelry or something?
Would ya go out with me or something?
Would ya sleep with me or something?"

Ya better watch out!
If your trains moving too fast.
Ya better look out!
if youre living in the past because
Thats why you'll never lose
These sweet, misery blues
Thats why you'll never lose
These sweet misery blues

Yeah im gonna corner you in an elevator
and you wont be able to put me off till later
I'll put on my charm
I'll tingle your spine
I'll take off my charm
And then you'll wanna die

"Could i buy you a dress or something?
Could I buy ya some jewelry or somethin?
Would you go out with me or somethin?
Would ya sleep with me or somethin?"

YOU BETTER WATCH OUT
cause you can't get rid of me
Ya better look out
Oh baby dont you see?
Thats why you'll never lose
These sweet misery blues
Thats why you'll never lose
These sweet misery blues
