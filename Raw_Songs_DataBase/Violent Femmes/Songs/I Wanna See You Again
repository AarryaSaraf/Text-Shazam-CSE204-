I wanna se you again,
I don't care where and I don't care when. 
I wanna see you again, 
cause this beginning will have no end. 
Bring your whips, bring your chains. 
We can exchange names. 
I wanna see you again. 
I feel a feeling since I don't know when. 
I wanna see you again, 
so you can know you have a friend. 
You're so passive. 
I'm filled with wrath. 
We could take a bath. 
I wanna see you again. 
Oh, their's talk of the lights on broadway 
and hearts intwining high above, 
and if frankly we'll see things my way, 
we will climb the heights of love. 
I wanna see you again. 
It doesn't matter where or when. 
I wanna see you again. 
I'm just beginning to have no end. 
Perfect love. 
Cast out fear. 
Let me, buy you a beer. 
I wanna see you again, 
and again, 
I wanna see you again.
