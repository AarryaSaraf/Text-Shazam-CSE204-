Something's wrong.
Why don't you tell me about it?
Something's wrong?
Why don't you let it out?
It will help me to help you
to help me to touch you.
But you're already gone.
Something's wrong.
I don't know what it is.
Something's wrong.
It's my problem, yes it is.
Because I want to touch you.
And I want you so much 
you don't even know.
Call me back, baby.
Call me back.
You can call me at any time.
Call me back, baby.
Call me back.
But don't you say everything's fine.
Because something's wrong.
And I see no help in view.
Something's wrong.
And I don't know what to do.
How can you love me to touch you?
And I want you so much
you don't even know.
Some day you'll want me too.
You'll want to touch so much.
But I'm already gone.
Something's wrong.
