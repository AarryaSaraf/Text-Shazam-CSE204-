One, two, three

I was sleepin' at the meetin'
At the meetin' I was sleepin'
I was sleepin' at the meetin'
At the meetin' I was sleepin'
At the meetin' I was sleepin'
I was sleepin' at the meetin'
I was sleepin' at the meetin'
At the meetin' I was sleepin'
At day I did sleep
The way that I creep

I was nappin' and a-crappin'
I was crappin' and a-nappin'
I was nappin' and a-crappin'
I was crappin' and a-nappin'
I was nappin' and a-crappin'
I was crappin' and a-nappin'
I was nappin' and a-crappin'
I was crappin' in a napkin
And I make lotta shit
The way that I creep

Well you think you got me 'cause you know I was there
Well, so what? I don't care
You ain't got nothin' even though I was there
Yeah, I was right there sleeping in my chair

I was thinkin' in a Lincoln
In a Lincoln I was thinkin'
I was thinkin' in a Lincoln
In a Lincoln I was thinkin'
In a Lincoln I was thinkin'
I was thinkin' in a Lincoln
In a Lincoln I was thinkin'
I was thinkin' in a Lincoln
Layin' in the backseat
The way that I creep

Well you think you got me 'cause you know I was there
Well, so what? I don't care
You ain't got nothin' even though I was there
Yeah I was right there sleepin' in my chair

Way that I creep (Come on)
Way that I creep (Everybody now)
Way that I creep (Yes)
Way that I creep

Can't stand the kitchen, I can't stand the heat
(Way that I creep)
Fahrenheit rising the way that I creep
(Way that I creep)
Can't take the bitchin', I can't stay oblique
(Way that I creep)
Celsius rising the way that I creep
(Way that I creep)
You may win today, I won't say that I'm beat
(Way that I creep)
Who can say the way that I creep
(Way that I creep)
And anyone know a Catwoman in heat
(Way that I creep)
That's the way I go, that's the way I creep
(Way that I creep)
You know, baby, I was thinking that maybe we could meet
(Way that I creep)
You know, baby baby baby, in the way that I creep
(Way that I creep)
Oh I take my whiskey neat
The way that I creep
(Way that I creep)
