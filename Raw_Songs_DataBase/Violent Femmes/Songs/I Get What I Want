Is this too hard
For little you to understand?
Then that's too bad for you
'Cause I don't ask, I command

This is what you will be denied
'Til you learn to do what you are told
You could have it all if you tried
But baby, please, it's getting old

If you can't obey me
Then you don't deserve me

I get what I want
And I want what I get
I want what I get
And I get what I want

Don't speak unless spoken to
Is this really so hard to do?
I took a picture for you
I was in the mood
You better pay attention, dude
I was in the nude
And I really could have screwed

So this is what you will be denied
'Til you learn to do what you are told
You could have me all if you tried
But baby, please, I'm getting old

If you can't obey me
Then you don't deserve me

I get what I want
And I want what I get
I want what I get
And I get what I want

I get what I want (Is this too hard)
And I want what I get (For little you to understand?)
I want what I get (Then that's too bad for you)
And I get what I want ('Cause I don't ask, I command)

I get what I want (Is this too hard)
And I want what I get (For little you to understand?)
I want what I get (Then that's too bad for you)
And I get what I want ('Cause I don't ask, I command)
