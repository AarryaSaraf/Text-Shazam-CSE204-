If you have a problem
Just get in the car and drive
Drive, drive, drive so you never get back
Drive, drive, drive you'll be so glad you did that
Just get in the car and drive

If you have a problem 
Just get on the bus and ride
Ride, ride, ride 'til you never get back
Ride, ride, ride you'll be so glad you did that
Just get on the bus and ride 

If your life unravels,
Make a plan and travels

If you have a problem
Just get in a tree and glide
Glide, glide, glide 'til you never get back
Glide, glide, glide you'll be so glad you did that
Just get in the tree and glide

Traveling solves everything 
Traveling's a blessed thing

When you have a problem 
Just get on the plane and fly
Fly, fly, fly 'til you never come back
Fly, fly, fly you'll be so glad you did that
Just get on the plane and fly

If your life unravels
Make a plan and travels

When you have a problem
Don't sit where you are and stew
Stew, stew, stew 'til you never get through
Stew, stew, stew 'til they're coming for you
Don't sit where you are stew

Because traveling solves everything
That's why traveling's a blessed thing
So if your life unravels
Just make a plan and travels
