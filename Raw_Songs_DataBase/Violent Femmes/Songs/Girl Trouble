Have mercy on me 
I got girl trouble up the ass 
have mercy on me people 
I got girl trouble up the ass 
and don't tell me no joke 
cause I'm not gonna laugh 
I need the cure 
only one cure in this world 
I need the cure 
only one cure in this world 
hey james brown 
I need a woman or a girl 
hit me in the morning 
hit me in the night 
hit me when I'm wrong 
hit me when I'm right 
hit me when I'm up 
hit me when I'm down 
hit me hit me hit me hit me 
all over town 
girl trouble 
I got girl trouble up the ass 
and don't tell me 
cause I'm not gonna laugh 
I'm not trying to fool you people 
I'm not giving you no jive 
make me feel I'd rather be dead than alive 
take a look around 
what's shoving up my behind 
problems drive me out of my mind 
girl trouble 
I got girl trouble up the ass 
and don't tell me no joke 
cause I'm not gonna laugh
