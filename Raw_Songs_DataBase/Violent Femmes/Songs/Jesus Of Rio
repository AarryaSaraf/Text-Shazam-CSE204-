Christ the Redeemer towering high over Rio... Rio de Janeiro. Rio... 
Christ the Redeemer towering high over Rio... Rio de Janeiro. Rio... 

Where they held a summit to save the world, and to mark the time when development,
As traditionally understood, had failed, and the affluent North raping the South,
Investment from the North means economic bondage for the South...

Under the burden of debt payments, I was with a whore in Copenhagan,
Drinking eight hundred dollars worth of champagne in kroner...
She came from Rio, we were trying to save the world...
We did not get what we wanted. 
She wanted money... she did not get what she wanted. 
I missed my wife... I did not get what I wanted.

Death sat on my lap. Death sits on all our laps.
While Christ the Redeemer towers high over Rio... Rio de Janeiro. Rio...
