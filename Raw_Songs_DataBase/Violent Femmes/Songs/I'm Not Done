Because I failed, because I tried
Because I wailed, because I cried
Because I lived and died
I have done all these things plus some
And with all these things I'm not done

We came together, we broke apart
We broke each other In mind and heart
It has ended, it will not restart

We have done all of this plus some
And with all of this we're not done
I'm not done, I'm not through yet
My heart won't let my mind forget

I was wild in the sight of God
I spared the child, I spoiled the rod
Remember once you smiled the angels trod

We have done all of this plus some
And with all of this you're not done
You're not done, You're not through yet
Your hate won't let your heart forget
And I'm not done, I'm not through yet
My mind can't let go on regret

Because I failed and when I tried
Cause I wailed when I cried
Cause I lived when I died

I have done all these things plus some
And with all of this I'm not done
I have done so much plus some
And with all these things I'm not done
