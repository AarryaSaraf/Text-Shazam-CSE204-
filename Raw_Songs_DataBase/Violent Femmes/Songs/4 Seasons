How will I stand the summer when spring was such a bummer?
How will I weather my winter when my fall was such a ballbuster?
It's spring and there'll be no spring fling when my winter was what a winner.
And I am taking a fall 'cause if I ain't got you I got nothing at all.

How will I stand the summer when the spring just made me dumber?
How will I fare my fall -- will I lose my mind in the wintertime?
It's spring and I'm a spring ding-a-ling...
It's summer and I'm just a little dumber...
And I am taking a fall 'cause if I ain't got you I got nothing at all.

Through the four seasons, I'm searching for reasons.

I'm not gonna take the spring 'cause the spring don't mean a thing.
I'm not gonna take the winter 'cause my winter is a splinter.
I'm not gonna take the summer -- summer is such a bummer.
But I am taking the fall 'cause if I ain't got you I got nothing at all.

Vivaldi, the four Seasons...
It seems to me to be a theme of love with no variations of aggravations.

Spring, summer, winter and fall...

Spring, summer, winter and fall...
If I ain't got you, I got nothing at all.
