This tea's too strong for me 
As I await your company 
I had too much sun today 
Ocean waters wash away 
Nothing but the present 
Presenting its presence 
This island life 
Separate my right from my wrong 
No I am not pagan 
But my heart has been forsaken 
And the hand of God was on my mind 
It took some time from time to time 
Now in the course I know 
Time itself will go when 
This island life 
Separates my right from my wrong 
You forgot your shoes and I 
I have sent a message but I 
There's so many stars in the sky 
It's the truths that will not lie 
There's a you wild native maiden 
Running mad and barefoot to the sea until 
This island life 
Separates my rights from my wrongs 
This island life 
Finally separates my right from my wrong 
This tea's too strong for me 
As I await more company 
I had too much sun today 
Dram of lands lying far away 
Pregnant with the present 
Presenting its presents 
This island life 
Separate my right from my wrong 
This island life 
Will separate my rights from my songs 
Separate my right from my wrong
