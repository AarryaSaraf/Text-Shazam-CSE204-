I seen you treat love as a simple mark
Caught up in moments of electric spark
Step inside just as you leave your mark
Defenseless

But sometimes when you look at me
In the darkness of your eyes, I see
What you really mean

Tell me lovers play a fickle game
A broken heart's just another name
For wounded pride in a war of lame
Pretenses 

But sometimes when you look at me
In the darkness of your eyes I see
What you really mean

Wonder of what can I be denied 
You pay the toll and you take the ride
You give it all or else you haven't tried
You don't lay, halfway

Dreams not asked for I see right through you
There's not much difference in the things that we do
I know you better than you want me to
But still

Sometimes when you look at me
In the darkness of your eyes I see 
What you really mean

Wonder of what can I be denied
You pay the toll and you take the ride
You give it all or else you haven't tried
You don't lay, halfway 
You don't lay, halfway 


I know there's some things that you can't erase
I shake my head as I watch you chase
From place to place, so as not to face 
The chances

That sometimes when you look at me 
In the darkness of my eyes you'll see
What I really mean

What you really mean
(What you really mean) 
(What you really mean) 
(What you really mean)
