bad bad bad bad bad
bad bad bad bad bad
bad bad bad bad
I was bas born
I'd be badder when I die
I'm bad when I am sober
I'm badder when I'm high
I'm when I feel good
I'm bad when I'm blue
I'm bad to myself
So I'll be bad to you
So I'll be bad to you
I should've been good
Look at the trouble I've had
I would if I could
But I'm just bad
bad bad bad bad bad
bad bad bad bad
I'm, bad and I'm alive
I'll be badder when I'm dead
I'm bad in my body
man I'm badder in the head
I'm bad in the bed
Something wrong from the start
Guilt in my mind
Evil in my heart
Evil in my heart
I don't need to be happy
I don't care if I'm sad
I don't care about nothin'
Cause I'm bad bad bad bad bad
bad bad bad bad
Don't lend me a dollar
Don't lend me a dime
Don't lend me your wife
She'll have a good time
I'm bad in my car
I'm badder when I'm home
I'm bad when I'm with you
And I'm badder all alone
I'm a low down worm
I'm a conquering worm
I'm a blood-suckin' worm
I'm a slime baitin' worm
I'll put you on the hook
And I'll watch you squirm
I could never learn
Any young turks new tricks
I could never learn
Not to kick against the pricks
Things go from bad to worse
Sometimes it makes me glad
That I was born
Under the Curse of being bad bad bad bad bad
bad bad bad bad
Don't lend me a dollar
Don't lend me dime,
Don't lend me your wife
She'll have a good time
Don't lend me a twenty,
Don't lend me a ten,
If you lend me a hundread
You'll never see me again
What I would do
These are the very things I don't do
And what I would not do
Those are the things that i do
Who shall deliver from this body of death
It's not Muhammed
And it's not Seth
I tried to be happy
But it onyl made me sad
I wanted to be good
But I'm just bad bad bad bad bad
bad bad bad bad bad
bad bad bad bad bad
bad bad bad
