Oh, I counted up last night
All our little times
You, yes you
Were just a drop in the rain
And even if I can't
Ever touch you again
By myself I will try
To hide, to lose you, and be lost

But I'm not gonna cry anymore for you
And don't you ask for me
I'm not gonna cry anymore for you
And don't you ask for me

Oh, I got drunk last night
Thinking about our times
You, yes you
Were just a drop in the wine
And even if I can't
Ever touch you again
By myself I will try
To hide, to lose you, and be lost

But I'm not gonna cry anymore for you
And don't you ask for me
I'm not gonna cry anymore for you
And don't you ask for me

I'm not gonna cry anymore for you
And don't you ask for me
I'm not gonna cry anymore for you
And don't you ask for me
