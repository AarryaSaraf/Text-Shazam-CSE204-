You look like you could be the mother of a girl 
a girl I hated more than any other girl in the world 
the way I let her treat me was totally a disgrace 
I wanted to permanently wipe that smile off her face 
no I'm not joking 
yes I was choking 
You look like you could be the mother of a girl 
a girl I loved more than any other girl in the world 
the way that i treated her was totally a crime 
I wanted to permanently wipe the joy out of my mind 

no I'm not joking 
yes I was choking 
You look like you could be the mother of a boy 
who bored me more than any other man in the land 
the way that he dogged me like I was totally a jerk 
I wanted to permanently pound his prick into the dirt 
no I'm not joking 
yes I was choking
