I know a woman who can hardly speak.
The feeling is so strong, and the foreman becomes weak.
It took one sentence to finish in a week.
I said "Yes, oh yes."
I said "This is what I've been waiting for."

I know a place where nothing can grow.
The summer will burn and the winter will snow.
And nothing moves but the wind, it blows.
It says "Yes, oh yes."
It says "This is what you've been homesick for."

I want to learn all the languages of man.
And question the wisdom in the maker's plan.
To babble on in our caravan
Where we say, "Yes, oh yes."
We said, "This is why we're not fighting.  Oh."

You take me by my hand and say,
That what I owe I can not repay,
But you still love me anyway.
And I said "Yes, oh yes."
I said "This is what I've been dying...Yes, oh yes!
This is what I've been crying for.  Yes, oh yes.
This is what I've been waiting for."
