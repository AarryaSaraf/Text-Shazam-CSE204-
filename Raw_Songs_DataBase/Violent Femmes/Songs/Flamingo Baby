You're a flamingo 
you stand on one leg 
you're a flamingo baby 
you hatched from an egg 
well you hold your foot up 
so delicately over the sea 
and when it comes down 
it comes down on me 
well it used to want to hump you 
I used to want to rock and roll 
I was attracted to your gracefulness 
but your surprise sure took its toll 
now I guess I'd better go out now 
gonna try to find something new 
and all I'm left with is this craving 
for some flamingo stew 
now the beauty's in the gutter 
the loveliness is off her throne 
in the eyes of the beholder it's gone 
and now he feels kind of alone 
but this feeling it's the kind that will shortly pass 
I'm gonna find myself another bird 
and roll on down the grass
