Where were you 
When Judas needed a band 
Sitting in the backseat 
With another woman in your hand 
Don't look this way 
With your changing point of view 
Just sit on a fence 
And pretend to be you 
Christ is crying 
Outside your church door 
Don't let him in 
He'll get mud on your floor 
Just put on your apron 
And count up all the money 
Don't you smell the burning 
And you just think it's funny 
You love yourself 
You love yourself 
Have we become what we wanted? 
You go ahead, I'll love myself more 
You're a man 
Who works for the Lord 
Polishing the statues 
When their faces look worn 
The best of times 
And the worst of men 
Don't seem to affect you 
You're asleep again 
You love yourself 
You love yourself 
Have we become what we wanted? 
You go ahead, I'll love myself more
