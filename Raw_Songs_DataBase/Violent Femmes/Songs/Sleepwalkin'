Someone sucked me 
late last evening
And it was time to make a change 
And i Wonder 
am i too late
am i too far a strange
For what i have been doin for all of these years
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'

I have so few good memories
somethings terably wrong
As a singer singing badly
As he tries to sing the wrong song
Look what i have been doing all of these years
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'
Something moving in the light
Something spoke to me and said "go, go, go, go"
Something's moving in the house show
Something to show 
For what ive been doing for all of these years
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'

Someone sucked me 
late last evening
And it was time to make a change 
And i Wonder 
am i too late
am i too far a strange
For what i have been doin for all of these years
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'
Sleepwalkin' Sleepwalkin' Slee-ee-eepwalkin'
