come with us and play!
see, we have breasts as women!
from your tents by the sea
come play with us: it is forbidden

come with us and play!
lo, bare, straight legs in the water!
by our boats we stay
then swimming away
come to us: it is forbidden!

come with us and play!
see, we are as tall as women!
our eyes are keen:
our hair is bright:
our voices speak outright:
we revel in the sea's green!
come play: it is forbidden!
