See my ships 
they are sailing 
in and out of the harbor 
will they go together 
or must they stay apart 
yes I know it's in my heart 
surely you see what's inside of me 
Jesus is coming soon 
I can hear Gabriel 
blow his trumpet tune 
this I know 
this I know 
our lord is coming soon 
mercy mercy me 
Marvin Gaye he was shot 
by his father 
o my Father 
have mercy on me 
cold kane o my cheap thrill 
o my shame for Cain 
and the devil 
momma I need water 
I'm thirsty 
surely you see 
what's inside of me
