I hope you got fat
I hope you got really fat 
'Cause if you got really, really fat
You just might want to see me come back
I hope you got fat

I don't care, I don't care
How heavy or how skinny
I don't care, I don't care
No, how heavy or how skinny

Just gimme, gimme something to love
A little extra weight would never look 
No nicer on nobody else but you
And I could always use a little bit more to hold on to

And if I get a fright in the middle of the night
I'll cling to you
I hope you got fat
I hope you got really fat
If you got truly fat, fat, fat
You just might want to see me come back
