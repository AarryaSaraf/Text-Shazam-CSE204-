36-24-36!

See a girl walkin' down the street, just the kind of girl that I'd like to meet.
It ain't her hair, her clothes, her feet -- somethin' much more discreet.
Now I ain't loud, baby, I ain't proud -- I just want what I'm not allowed.
Movin' on up and I help myself to do a world of good for my mental health.

36-24-36 -- something's broken that needs to be fixed.
I don't know how to tell you this, 
But I'm getting bored and I need some kicks like 36-24-36.

Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man -- I got a red hot plan if you understand.
Cannot fail, it's plain to see -- I'm havin' fun and makin' money.
I know this summer's gonna be the best if I don't die from lack of rest.
Experience what my daddy said, that's what I got, just like he said.

36-24-36 -- something was broke but I got it fixed.
I don't know if I should tell you this,
But I was gettin' bored and I got my kicks like 36-24-36.

Something's special 'bout her personality,
Something's special 'bout her psysiology.

36-24-36 -- I want lots of pretty chicks.
36-24-36 -- I want lots of pretty chicks.
36-24-36 -- I want lots of pretty chicks.
36-24-36 -- I want lots of...
