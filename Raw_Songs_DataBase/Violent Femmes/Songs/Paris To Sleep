Paris to sleep, two, three, four

Some people come here to drink
True or not true, what do you think?
And the wine flows, so the line goes
Makes the old young and I'm told it's fun
And yes, I had a drink or two or three or perhaps more
But they are not what I came here for
Please, lover, don't let the terror scare us too deep
And I came to Paris to sleep

Some people come here to think
Philosophy agrees with me, and you, would you like a drink?
And the time goes whichever way the mind wind blows
It makes the young old, it's not fun, I am told
And yes, I had a thought or two or three or perhaps more
But these are not what I came here for
My brother, don't let the terror scare us too deep
And I came to Paris to sleep

I'm sorry I was late and you waited all day
True or not true, I feel this way
I lay in the bed and I waited all day
For feeling to pass and not stay
I'm sorry, it was great and then it went away
I'm sorry I was late again today

Some people come here for love
Is this for you? Yes, I think so, my love
Oh, love comes and comes and goes and goes and the love-light lies lying low
You never know, you never know
I guess I had a love or two or three or perhaps more
But losing lost love is not worth losing for
All the horror and the terror may tear us and scare us to sleep
Or it may bear us to Paris where I came to weep
