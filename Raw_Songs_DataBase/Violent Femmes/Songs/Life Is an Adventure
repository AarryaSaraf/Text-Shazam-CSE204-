Life is an adventure, 
made for an adventurer. 
Made just for the boy who can, 
grow up strong and become a man. 
Nothing will bother you, 
you will do what you want to. 
Laughes and loves and hopes and dreams, 
action will supply the means. 
Living for something. 
Foregiving nothing, 
and you're forgiving, nothing, 
cause you're living for something. 
Fast is fast, the sacred cow. 
Life is in the here and now. 
Got to dream and got to hope. 
Broaden your horizon scope. 
I told you once and I told you twice, 
Japanese eat lots of rice. 
You can be my assistant. 
It could be to you detriment. 
Ah we're believing something. 
Conceiving a great wealth. 
Conceiving nothing 
Believing in myself 
Life is an adventure, 
made for an adventurer. 
Made just for the boy who can, 
grow up strong and become a man.
