I'm not doing something I'm supposed to do 
I'm doing something I'm not supposed to 
I don't know about that 
I don't know about that 
I don't know nothing bout nothing like that 
destroyed my people are 
destroyed my people are 
destroyed for lack of knowledge 
I wonder if I'm happy 
wonder if I'm mad 
I wonder why the whole wide world is so wonderfully sad 
I don't know bout that but I can tell you this 
that when I drink a lot of beer y'know I gotta piss... off 
people should be pissed off 
people should be pissed off 
for lack of knowledge 
read read read read read read read everything you can read and 
learn learn learn learn learn learn learn everything you can learn 
cause there is no tomorrow like today 
and there is no today like tomorrow 
and they will stick you and they will stick you in the end
