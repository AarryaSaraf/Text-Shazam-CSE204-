Come on in my car
I got a big one
Come on, we will ride around
We'll go out where there is no one
See you when you're sinkin' down
Sinkin' down
Sinkin' down

Cruisin' all around your high school
All your girlfriends to impress
They think they know what we might do
But what we're doin'
They can only guess
Only guess
They can only guess

Oh when you wear that thing you wear
It ain't fair, it ain't right
Sweat on your lip and a tender hip
I gotta take - one - a little bitty bite oh baby

When exactly are your classes?
Which exactly do you wanna cut?
You look even better without your glasses
You been sleepin' your whole life
I'm gonna wake you up
Wake you up
Wake you up

She's just a teenage tart
But she moved right into my heart

Oh when you do that thing you do
It ain't good, it's the best
A tender kiss and I'll tell you this
That in my hand there's a little swelling

Come on in my car
I got a big one
Come on, we will ride around
We'll go out where there is no one
And baby your body will not be
Found
It will not be found
It will not be found
