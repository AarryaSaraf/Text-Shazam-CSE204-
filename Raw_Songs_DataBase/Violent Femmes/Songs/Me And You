Me, me and you
That's what I want, that's what I want
You, you and me
That's what I need, that's what I need

Oh, but something, something, something, something
Something, something, something always
Mess me up, man, I'm messing up, I'm messing up
And nothing, nothing gonna keep me from your loving
'Cause I, I love you too too much to tell you something else but

Me, me and you
That's what I want, that's what I want
You, you and me
That's what I need, that's what I need
When, when we went
That is when you will be, yeah
You, you and me
Then we'll be happy

Oh, but something, something, something, something
Something, something, something always
Mess me up, man, I'm messing up, I'm messing up
And nothing, nothing gonna keep me from your loving
'Cause I, I love you too much to tell you what I

Me, me and you
That's what I want, that's what I want
You, you and me
That's what I need, that's what I need
You and me, happy
You will be, happy
You and me, happy
