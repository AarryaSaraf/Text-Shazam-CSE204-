I've been outside the palace 
I've been outside the gate 
I still don't feel that I made any mistake 
when I got off that train 
I felt my feet hit the ground 
I didn't want to go 
where that gravy train was bound 
GOD help me to see 
I've been loved all along 
and not to get too confused 
between the moonlight and the dawn 

if I go back to the palace 
I'll walk right thru' the gate 
nobody knows how much here was at stake 
I might get on that train 
in feel the wheel on the train 
move it on up the mountain like a foregone fact 
GOD help me to know 
I've been in love my whole life 
and not to get so confused 
between the struggle and the strife
