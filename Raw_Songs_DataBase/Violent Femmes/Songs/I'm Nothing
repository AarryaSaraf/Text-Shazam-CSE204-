I am N-O-T-H-I-N'
I am N-O-T-H-I-N'
I am N-O-T-H-I-N'
I'm nothin'

I am N-O-T-H-I-N'
I am N-O-T-H-I-N'
I am N-O-T-H-I-N'
I'm nothin'

Are you Republican or Democrat?
A liberal fascist full of crap?
I'm nothin', I'm nothin'
Somebody somewhere said he was something
But everybody, everywhere knows that I'm nothin'

Politics and dirty tricks - I got no time for stones and sticks
Politics and dirty tricks - I got no time for chasin' chicks
I'm nothin', I'm nothin'
Somebody somewhere said he was something
But everybody, everywhere saying I'm nothin'

There's nothin' high, there's nothin' low
'Cause being nothin' this is our flow

Are you gay or are you straight?
Do you believe in love or do you believe in hate?
I'm nothin', I'm nothin'
Somebody somewhere said he was something
But everybody, everywhere is sayin' I'm nothin'

I'm nothin', I'm like a cloud
I'm free to be alone in a crowd

What's your reality? It's not real to me
What's your anomaly? It is my destiny

I am N-O-T-H-I-N'
I am N-O-T-H-I-N'
I am N-O-T-H-I-N'
I'm nothin'
I'm nothin'
I'm nothin'

I'm nothin' now and I'm nothin' free
'Cause being nothin' is just being me
