Oh, I could be this or I could be that
I could pull an elephant out of a hat
I could slay a dragon or I could be a king
I could be anything

I am at occidental in the land of dragon's breath
Where they are not ornamental but are real as life or death
Where they terrorize the populists, the people point with fear
For dragons have no thoughtfulness, their egos are severe

My name is Bongo and I may be small
I am the bravest man of them all
I'll fight the fearful dragon, I'll kill him with my sword
I always fight big dragons, especially when I'm bored

I met him in the open to fight him fair and square
His mouth he held wide open, putrefying the air
He blazed such fearful fires, people thought I was dead
But my courage engine fires and I chopped off his head

Oh, I could do this or I could do that
I could pull an elephant out of a hat
I could slay a dragon or I could be a king
I could do anything

The people they all cheered and they gave out quite a whoop
For the dragon they had feared had been turned to dragon poop
We partied all day and we partied all night
They held a royal festival where the king made me a knight

Thy name was Bongo but that no more shall stay
You once were simply Bongo but now my Knight today
Sir Bongo, I now dub thee
Sir Bongo for all eternity
Thy name shall be Sir Bongo

The following peace and devotional was solemn and sublime
The king got all emotional and he said "All I have is Thine
Take my only daughter, the princess fair
And with all my treasure you'll make a royal pair
She's so beautiful and so true, she will be your bride
To have a son-in-law like you would give me great pride
And now I can begin with my retirement plan
Now I know the kingdom rests in your sure hands"

Now from the mountains to the plains, the Mississippi to the Congo
The whole world knows the name of the of the g-g-g-good King Bongo
Now from the mountains to the plains, Mississippi to the Congo
The whole world knows the name of the of the great Sir King Bongo
The great King Bongo

I could do this or I could be that
I could pull an elephant out of a hat
I could slay a dragon or I could be a king
I could do anything

Oh, I could do this or I could do that
I could put that elephant right back in his hat
I could slay a dragon or I could be a king
I could be anything
I could be anything
I could be anything

Bongo
