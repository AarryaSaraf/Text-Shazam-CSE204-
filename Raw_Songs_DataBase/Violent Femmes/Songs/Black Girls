I dig the black girls, oh, so much more than the white girls
I was so pleased to learn they were faster
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, oooh and after

Along comes a faggot white boy
Said look, look, look for some kind of joy
They come around so queer and quiet
But inside rebel and riot

Said I dig the white boys
Oh, so much more that the black boys
I was so pleased to learn they're not smarter
Go on, give, give, give it to me harder, harder, harder, just say harder

You know I love the Lord of hosts
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
I was so pleased to learn that he's inside me
In my time of trouble he will hide me

I dig the black girls
I dig the black girls
I dig the black girls
I dig the black girls
