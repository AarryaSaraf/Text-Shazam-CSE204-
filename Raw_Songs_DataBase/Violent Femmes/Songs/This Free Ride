I am on a free ride
I'll be fit to be tied
I don't need no kind of pride
Not with me on this free ride

Near and far, far and wide
Hey, your car's a great ride
Alright, maybe I just lied
But it's still a free ride

I am on a free ride
I'll be fit to be tied
And I don't need your pride
Not with me on this free ride

Easy-peasy, I'm like "Dag"
Cold and greasy in a paper bag
Cool and breezy, chicken hard-fried
Ain't nothin' easy on this frickin' free ride

I am on a free ride
I'll be gone with every tide
And I don't need no drive
Not with me on this free ride

Aw, hey, I got nothing inside
Nada nada, alas I sighed
Weep for the weeper, I cried
I creep like a creeper on my frickin' free ride

I am on a free ride
And although I'll be fit to be tied
Man, I don't need your pride
Not with me on this free ride

I've been sailing on The Bounty
I'm seeing Captain Bligh
Crossing into the county
Mutiny on this free ride

Hey, hey, I tried
Oh, sorry again, I just lied
I would've flown in if I could've flied
But I'm just blown by the winds in my free ride

I am on a free ride
I'll be gone with every tide
And you don't need no kind of pride
Not with me on this free ride
Not if you're with me on my free ride
