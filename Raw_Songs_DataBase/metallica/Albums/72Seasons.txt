// 72 Seasons //

Feeding on the wrath of man

Shot down
Traumatic
Time haunted by the past
Long gone
Dogmatic
Although the die is cast
Shot down
Volcanic
But what is done is done and done
Look back
Psychotic
No chance before this life began

Staring into black light
Dominating birthright

Wrath of man
Leaching through
Split in two
Wrath of man
Crash into
Point of view
Wrath of man

Feeding on the wrath of man

Shoot back
Erratic
Mad seasons take their toll
New mask
Chaotic
Completely lost control
Shoot back
Fanatic
Wither under looming shadow cast
Slip back
Narcotic
Blinded by the ashes of the past

Staring into black light
Choking on the stage fright

Wrath of man
Leaching through
Split in two
Wrath of man
Crash into

Wrath of man

Wrath of man
Thrive upon
Feeding on
72 seasons gone

Piercing through
Cut in two
Polarize
Point of view
Crash into
Paralyze

Feeding on the wrath of man

Man down
Barbaric
Quick fire machine gun thoughts
Deep seed
Stigmatic
Some have and some have not
Man down
Demonic
No mercy from the ghost within
Turn back
Hypnotic
There's breathing out but not back in

Staring into black light
Permanently midnight

Wrath of man
Leaching through
Split in two

// Shadows Follow //

Hanging by a thread as I play dead
Hanging by a thread and my mind is code red
Cut and run, try to hide, get away
Shut my eyes, just to hide from the fate
Cut and run, try to hide, get away
Cover up, get shelter from the hate

Demonized, liquified, tranquilized
Prophesied, just to hide from life
Night and day, led astray, in decay
Come what may, not to face that fight

Seething
Breathing
Nightmares grow
On I run
Still my shadows follow

Never can I stop 'cause they hunt me
Never can I stop 'cause the beast is hungry
Like a wolf on the hunt stalking prey
Closing in, no, it won't let me be
Like a wolf on the hunt stalks a prey
Any cost, fulfill a destiny

Seething
Fast breathing
Nightmares grow
On I run
Still my shadows follow
On I run
But still my shadows follow

Cut and run, hide away from fate
Cover up, try to hide the hate
Like a wolf, it won't let me be
Closing in, wish away, shut my eyes

Wish it away

Seething
Fast breathing
Nightmares grow
On I run
Still my shadows follow

Facing
My demons
Now I know
If I run
Still my shadows follow

I say "No!"
Still my shadows follow
