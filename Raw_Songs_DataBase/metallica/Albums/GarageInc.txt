// Am I Evil? //

My mother was a witch, she was burned alive.
Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried.
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
All blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace.

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.

As I watched my mother die, I lost my head.
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread.
Taking no chances, you come with me.
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free.

Twenty-seven, everyone was nice.
Gotta see 'em make 'em pay the price.
See their bodies out on the ice.
Take my time.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man, yes I am.

On with the action now, I'll strip your pride.
I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you ride.
Your face is scarred with steel, wounds deep and neat.
Like a double dozen before ya, smells so sweet.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.

I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire.
You can come with me, sweet desire.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.

My soul is longing for, await my heir.
Sent to avenge my mother, sweep myself.
My face is long forgot, my face not my own.
Sweet and timely whore, take me home.

Am I evil? Yes I am.
Am I evil? I am man.

Am I evil? Yes I fucking am.
Am I evil? I am man, yeah.

// Blitzkrieg //

Let us have peace, let us have life,
Let us escape the cruel night.
Let us have time, let the sun shine,
Let us beware the deadly sign.

The day is coming, Armageddon's near,
Inferno's coming, can we survive the blitzkrieg.
The blitzkrieg, the blitzkrieg.

Save us from fate, save us from hate,
Save ourselves before it's too late.
Come to our need, hear our plea,
Save ourselves before the earth bleeds.

The day is dawning, the time is near,
Aliens calling, can we survive the blitzkrieg.

// Helpless //

I've gotta see you moving fast, see you come my way.
See the dreams, I hope they last, never fade away.
Gotta see the lights above, make it loud tonight.
Gotta set it all afire, set it all alight.

See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar,
I am gonna set you all alight.
Gotta make it man, I ain't got a choice,
Gotta fill this hall tonight.

Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless.

I don't know what I'm gonna do, maybe not tonight.
Gotta set you all afire, gotta treat you right.
I can see the flashing lights, lit before your love.
Gotta hear the thunder roar, coming from above.

See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar,
I am gonna set you all alight.
Gotta make it man, I ain't got a choice,
Gotta fill this hall tonight.

Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless.

I can see the stars, I can see what's going on.
Every night alone I sing my song just for fun.
Only time will tell if I'll make it myself someday.
This stage is mine, music is my destiny.

Cannot squeeze the life from me.

I can see the stars, I can see what's going on.
Every night alone I sing my song just for fun.
Only time will tell if I'll make it myself someday.
This stage is mine, music is my destiny.

Cannot squeeze the life from me.

// The Small Hours //

Look out at the darkness, and you will see.
Just call my name and I'll be there.
You cannot touch me, you would not dare.
I am the chill that's in the air.

And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.

Dark rivers are flowing back into the past.
You are the fish for which I cast.
And what of the future, what is to be.
As the rivers flow into the sea.

And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.

Do not take for granted, powers out there.
Don't step into the demon's lair.
Time is an illusion, rising from time.
Steep is the mountain which we climb.

And I try to get through to you, in my own special way,
As the barriers crumble at the end of the day.

// The Wait //

Motives changing, day to day,
The fire increases, masks decay.
I look at the river, white foam floats down,
The body's poisoned, gotta sit tight.

The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.

After wakening, silence grows,
The screams subside, distortion shows.
Mutant thoughts of bad mouthed news,
Is just another birth of distorted views.

The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.

The wait, the wait, the wait, the wait.

// Crash Course In Brain Surgery //

Look inside and you will see,
The words are cutting deep inside my brain.
Thunder burning, quickly burning,
Knife of words is driving me insane, insane yeah.

Raven black is on my track,
He shows me how to neutralize the knife.
Show to me in surgery,
The art of fighting words to conquer life, conquer life yeah.

Now the wicked lance of fear,
Is driving from my heady mountain brain.
Crash course in brain surgery,
Has stopped the bloody knife of words again yeah, yeah, yeah.

// Sabbra Cadabra //

I feel so good, I feel so fine
Love that little lady, always on my mind
She gives me loving every night and day
Never gonna leave her, never going away

Someone to love me, you know she makes me feel alright!
Someone to need me, love me every single day!

I feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love it's something out of this world
It feels so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for, I'll love her till the end of time!
She makes me feel happy, it's good to know that she's all mine

I am the world that hides
The universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces
Is my one and only crime
I lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child never was conceived
You gotta believe me!
Hey! I'm talkin' to you!
Well, I know its hard for you
To know the reason why
And I know you'll understand
When it's time to die
I don't believe the life you have
Will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep
To let your soul live on, Ha Ha!!

Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love, it's something out of this world
Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that woman till the end of time

Someone to live for, love her till the end of time!
She makes me feel happy, it's good to know she's all mine,
She's all mine, yeah!

// Turn The Page //

On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moanin' out its one note song
You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before

But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
When you riding sixteen hours there's nothing much to do
And you don't feel much like ridin', you just wish the trip was through

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playin' star again
There I go, turn the page

So you walk into this restaurant, all strung-out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode

And most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can
All the same old clichés, "Is it woman? Is it man?"
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand
Make your stand

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playin' star again
There I go, turn the page

Out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy you try to give away
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play

Later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette, rememberin' what she said
What she said

Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playin' star again
There I go, turn the page

There I go, turn that page
There I go, yeah
There I go, yeah
There I go, yeah
Here I go, yeah
There I go
There I go
And I'm gone

// Die, Die My Darling //

Ah

// Mercyful Fate //

[a medley of the songs "Satan's Fall", "Curse of the Pharaohs", "A Corpse Without Soul", "Into the Coven", "Evil"]

Satan's Fall
They're walking by the night
The moon has frozen blue
Long black coats a shelter for the rain
Their load must get through
Now bats are leaving their trees
They're joining the call
Seven satanic Hell preachers
Heading for the hall
Bringing the blood of a newborn child
Got to succeed, if not it's Satan's fall

Curse Of The Pharaohs
Away out in Egypt in the valley of kings
Where the mummified pharaohs
Pretend dead in their sleep
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you
The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly
Just destroying your future
Makin' it all shady
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you

A Corpse Without Soul
Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse
I'm a corpse without soul
Satan, he's taken, he's taken
He's taken his toll
And he took it on me
I, I'm trapped, I'm trapped
I'm trapped in his spell
Tonight, I'm going, I'm going
I'm going to Hell, inside his spell

Into The Coven
Howl like a wolf
And a witch will open the door
Follow me and meet our high priestess
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child
Undress until you're naked
And put on this white coat
Take this white cross and go to the center of the ring
Come, come into my coven
And become Lucifer's child

Evil
I was born on the cemetery
Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave by the dead
And I was made a mercenary
In the legions of Hell
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane
You know my only pleasure
Is to hear you cry
I'd love to hear you cry
I'd love to see you die
And I'll be the first
To watch your funeral
And I'll be the last to leave
I'd love to hear you cry
And when you're down beyond the ground
I'll dig up your body again
And make love to shame
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
You've gotta say goodbye
'Cause I will eat your mind

// Astronomy //

Clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madman's face
His reasons tends to fly away
Like lesser birds on the four winds
Like silver scrapes in May
And now the sand's become a crust
Most of you have gone away

Come Susie dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you'll soon be married
And you'll want to know where winds come from
Well it's never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know
At the Four Winds Bar

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Four winds at the Four Winds Bar
Two doors locked and windows barred
One door left to take you in
The other one just mirrors it

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The Queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes the light that never, never warms
Yes the light that never
Never warms
Never warms
Never warms

The clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Miss Carrie nurse and Susie dear
Would find themselves at Four Winds Bar

It's the nexus of the crisis
And the origin of storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Call me Desdinova
Eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
And don't forget my dog
Fixed and consequent

Astronomy...a star

// Whiskey In The Jar //

// Tuesday's Gone //

Train roll on, on down the line
Won't you please take me far away
Now, I feel the wind blow outside my door
I leave my woman at home

Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind

And I don't know oh where I'm going
I just want to be left alone
When this train ends, I'll try again
I leave my woman at home

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind

Train roll on

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind

Train roll on, many miles from my home
See, I'm riding my blues away
Tuesday, you see, she had to be free
But somehow, I've got to carry on

Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
Tuesday's gone with the wind
My baby's gone with the wind

[repeat "Train roll on" and "Tuesday's gone" etc., in various combinations until the end]

// The More I See //

From where I stand I see
Pain suffering and misery

The more I see the more I see
The less the less I believe

From where I stand I see
Hate violence and war

The more I see the more I see
The less the less I believe

Breadfan, open up your mind, open up your purse,
Open up your bones, never, never gonna lose it.

Gonna lose it in the end, who's a fool.
Seagull, give it all away, stay a bird, stay a man,
Stay a ghost, stay what you wanna be.

Loser, give it all away, never stay with the winner,
With the man with all the filthy money.
Come on, keep it on the side, with a ride on a record,
On the top if you're gonna be a bad boy.

Gonna lose it in the end, who's a fool.

// The Prince //

Now I see his face, I see his smile.
Such a lonely place, no golden mile.
Eyes tell of morbid tales, of his black heart.
His deeds through ages past tell of his part.

See his face, see his smile.
Time to die, o-oh, no-oh, no-oh.

Angel from below, change my dreams.
I want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem.
I wish to sell my soul, to be reborn.
I wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns.

See his face, see his smile.
Time to die, o-oh, o-oh, no-oh.

I was born a fool, don't want to stay that way.
Devil take my soul, with diamonds you repay.
I don't care for heaven, so don't you look for me to cry.
And I will burn in hell, from the day I die.

See his face, see his smile.
Time to die, o-oh, no-oh, no.

// Stone Cold Crazy //

Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning,
I was dreaming I was Al Capone.
Rumours going round, gotta clear out of town,
Smell like a dry fishbone.
Here come the law, gonna break down the door,
Carry me away once more.
Never, never, never want it anymore,
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know.

Rainy afternoon, ought to kill a typhoon,
And she's playing on my slide trombone.
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore,
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know.

Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet,
Fully loaded Tommy gun.
Here come the deputy, try fucking getting me,
Gotta fucking get up and run.
They got the sirens loose, I ran right out of juice.
They're gonna put me in a cell,
If I can't go to heaven, let me go to hell.
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know, yeah.

// Killing Time //

Sound of gunfire comes through the night,
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight.
Reports come in of the heavy attack,
Message is seen, we're moving back.

Preparations are made for the journey back,
It's a survival, supplies are packed.
No more nights in this eternal hell,
Destination is simple, we move out.

Killing time - You left from the line.
Killing time - Your turn to kill.
Killing time - What do you say?
Killing time - Aaha, killing time.

And he knew what he needed to keep us alive,
No time for cowardice, kill and survive.
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife,
Nasty word, he'll take your life.

The silence is over, they attack again,
Killing and hatred drive me insane.
Reports come in of a heavy attack,
Message is seen, we're moving back.

Killing time - You left from the line.
Killing time - Your turn to kill.
Killing time - What do you say?
Killing time - Aaha, killing time.

Sound of gunfire comes through the night,
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight.
Reports come in of a heavy attack,
Message is seen, we're moving back.

And he knew what he needed to keep us alive,
No time for cowardice, kill and survive.
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife,
Nasty word, he'll take your life.

Killing time - You left from the line.
Killing time - Your turn to kill.
Killing time - What do you say?
Killing time - Aaha, killing time.

// Overkill //

Only way to feel the noise
Is when it's good and loud
So good I can't believe it
Screamin' with the crowd

Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Overkill
Overkill
Overkill
Shut up

On your feet you feel the beat
It goes straight to your spine
Shake your head, you must be dead
If it don't make you fly

Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Overkill
Overkill
Overkill
Get the fuck down

Ooh yeah

Know your body's made to move
It goes straight to your spine
You gotta move it
If it don't make you fly

Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Overkill
Overkill
Overkill
Get on it!

// Damage Case //

Hey babe don't act so scared
All I want is some special care
On the run from some institution
All I want is some constellation

And I can tell by his face
I'm a total disgrace
Put me inside this place
Move over for a damage case

Hey baby wait a minute, stop
Don't run away, don't call a cop
I Ain't lookin' to victimize you
All I want to do is tantalize you

I can tell by your face
I'm all over this place
I can tell by your face
Got no time for a damage case

No time baby!

Hey babe don't turn away
I'm here tomorrow, gone today
I don't know what you think your game is
I don't care if you want your name is

And I can tell by this face
You're all over the place
I can tell by his face
Move over for a damage case
Get the fuck over man!

All right

// Stone Dead Forever //

Get on!

You think you see me
In the glass
You think you hear me
Better listen fast
I think I see you
Gone to seed
Think your reason
Is your guilt and greed

You're out there on your own
Your face turned to stone
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever
All right

You're a financial wizard
Yeah a top tycoon
You're Sweet long lizard
With a silver spoon
You know you've never had it
Quite so good
And you didn't know
That you even could

Your time has come to own
Your touch turned to gold
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever
All right

Financial wizard
A top tycoon
Sweet lounge lizard
With a silver spoon
You've never had it
Quite so good
And you didn't know
That you even could

But your time has turned to gold
Your touch is turned to gold
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever

It's been a long time
It's been a long long wait
And you caught your fingers
In the pearly gates
You better leave your number
And we'll call you
You know your problem
Ain't exactly new

Your time has come today
Your face has turned to hey
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever
That's right

Yo

Ah

// Too Late Too Late //

Huh

I see that nothing's changed
Insist on playing games
Some waste of time you are
And you're so popular
Well this is it you bitch
I've got to make my switch
I'm just another john
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
No-oh, too late, too late

I thought you was for real
But you're a rip-off deal
Don't give me all that crap
I just escaped your trap
I think you see the joke
But you're just chasin' smoke
You ain't another one
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Hello, too late, too late
Oh

Get on it!

Misunderstanding me
The way you feel so free
I'm gonna jump the gun
Oh I'm gonna hit an' run
Your credibility
Don't cut no ice with me
Another privilege gone
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Oh oh, too late, too late
Oh, too late, too late
