Hanging by a thread as I play dead
Hanging by a thread and my mind is code red
Cut and run, try to hide, get away
Shut my eyes, just to hide from the fate
Cut and run, try to hide, get away
Cover up, get shelter from the hate

Demonized, liquified, tranquilized
Prophesied, just to hide from life
Night and day, led astray, in decay
Come what may, not to face that fight

Seething
Breathing
Nightmares grow
On I run
Still my shadows follow

Never can I stop 'cause they hunt me
Never can I stop 'cause the beast is hungry
Like a wolf on the hunt stalking prey
Closing in, no, it won't let me be
Like a wolf on the hunt stalks a prey
Any cost, fulfill a destiny

Seething
Fast breathing
Nightmares grow
On I run
Still my shadows follow
On I run
But still my shadows follow

Cut and run, hide away from fate
Cover up, try to hide the hate
Like a wolf, it won't let me be
Closing in, wish away, shut my eyes

Wish it away

Seething
Fast breathing
Nightmares grow
On I run
Still my shadows follow

Facing
My demons
Now I know
If I run
Still my shadows follow

I say "No!"
Still my shadows follow
