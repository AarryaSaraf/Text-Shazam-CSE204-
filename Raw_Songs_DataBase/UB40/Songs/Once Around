Once around was all I ever needed
And in my dreams you take me by the hand
And I know that you will be with me forever
As the wheel takes us both once more around

Once around the wheel begins revolving
Our bodies slowly lifted from the crowd
The hustle of the city's slowly fading
And the heartbeat is the only living sound


Once around was all I ever needed
And in my dreams you take me by the hand
And I know that you will be with me forever
As the wheel takes us both once more around

We slowly watch the night give way to morning
And hope we can suspend ourselves in time
And some I'll make these moments last forever
And leave the ones who need us for behind

Once around is all I have to give you
Close your eyes you don't have to make a sound
By the time it takes this wheel to stop revolving
There's something that you need to understand


Once around was all I ever needed
And in my dreams you take me by the hand
And I know that you will be with me forever
As the wheel takes us both once more around
