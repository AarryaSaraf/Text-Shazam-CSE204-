The whole town talking 'bout
You and your new guy
You're flying and high
In your single world

But you're gonna need me
But you're gonna need me
You're gonna need me down here
And it won't be long

When you leave and say goodbye
Don't come back with tears in your eyes
You had a good lover once
But you didn't know

But you're gonna need me
But you're gonna need me
You're gonna need me down here
And it won't be long

The whole town talking 'bout
You and your new guy
You're flying and high
In your single world

But you're gonna need me
But you're gonna need me
You're gonna need me down here
And it won't be long

When you leave and say goodbye
Don't come back with tears in your eyes
You had a good lover once
But you didn't know

But you're gonna need me
But you're gonna need me
You're gonna need me down here
And it won't be long
