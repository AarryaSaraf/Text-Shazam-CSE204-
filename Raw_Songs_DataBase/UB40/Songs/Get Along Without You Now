Aha mhmm gonna get along without you now
Aha mhmm I'm gonna get along without you now
You told me I was the latest thing
You even asked me to wear your ring
You ran around with every girl in town
You didn't even care if it got me down
Aha mhmm gonna get along without you now
Aha mhmm I'm gonna get along without you now
Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now
Thought I'd find somebody who was twice as cute
'Cos I didn't like you anyhow
You told everybody that we were friends
But this is where our friendship ends
'Cos all of a sudden you changed your tune
You haven't been around since way last June
Aa-ha-oo-hoo gonna get along without you now
I got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now
So long my honey
Goodbye my dear
Gonna get along without you now
Oo-hoo
Get darling without you now
Get darling without you now
Get darling without you now
Aha aha gonna get along without you now
Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now
So long my honey
Goodbye my dear
Gonna get along without you now
Oo-hoo hoo hoo
So loong my honey
Goodbye my dear
Gonna get along without you now
Oo-hoo hoo hoo hoo
