Wow ho ho yeah yeah
Wow ho now now
Oh oh yeah, yeah

How could I leave
How could I possibly go on
If you should say goodbye
Just like a rose
If you don't water it every morn
It withers and it dies

Promise you won't leave me
Promise you won't hurt me
Promise you won't ever make me blue
If you ever leave me, If you should desert me
Baby I don't know just what I'd do
I don't know just what I'd do
I really don't know just I'd do
Wow ho ho

It was ordained that man should leave his mother and cling
To the woman that he loves (Umm, yeah)
I'm very sure, that I could never love anyone
The way I love you now

Oh oh yeah
Wow ho ho ho
How could I, how could I baby
Wow yeah, yeah
Wow now now oh oh yeah... oh yeah

It was ordained that man should leave his mother and cling

Oh oh yeah
Wow ho ho ho

Wow yeah, yeah
Wow now now oh oh yeah... oh yeah
