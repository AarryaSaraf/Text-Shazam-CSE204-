Every day is just a holiday
I don't care what the crowd may say
I live the life I love, with you
Having fun while you were feeling blue

Every day is just another day
I do things the same old way
I swing and dine, I joke a while, play a while
'Cause every day is just a holiday

Every day is just a holiday
I don't care what the crowd may say
I live the life I love, with you
Having fun while you were feeling blue

Every day is just another day
I do things the same old way
I swing and dine, I joke a while, play a while
'Cause every day is just a holiday

Every day is just a holiday
I don't care what the crowd may say
I live the life I love, with you
Having fun while you were feeling blue

Every day is just another day
I do things the same old way
I swing and dine, I joke a while, play a while
'Cause every day is just a holiday
