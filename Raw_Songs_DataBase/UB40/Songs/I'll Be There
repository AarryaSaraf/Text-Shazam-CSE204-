I never promised you romance
I never said that I would dance
And I'm not learning

I never said I'd buy you rings
I never promised you a thing
And I'm not turning


But I would put no one above you
And you will always know I care
As long as you let me love you
I'll be there

You ask me could I love you more
There's only you that I adore
But you're not believing

Nor would I ever break your heart
I couldn't bear to be apart
So I'm not leaving


Cos I would put no one above you
And you will always know I care
As long as you let me love you
I'll be there
