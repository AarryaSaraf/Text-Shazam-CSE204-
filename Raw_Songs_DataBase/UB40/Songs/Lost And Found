Anybody could be me, you could be standing here
It's so very easy for me to disappear
No-one seems to see me; it's as if I don't exist
I'm going nowhere and I know I won't be missed

I was lost, now I'm found
Looks like finally, somebody up there's got an eye on me
Underground, chained and bound, suddenly I'm free
I was lost, now I'm found but reason to be me

Everyone is waiting, everyday is just the same
Everybody needs some happiness to counteract the pain
Maybe somewhere, someday, someone will notice me
I could find myself again and hope and dignity yeah

I was lost (what made you leave me?)
Now I'm found (what made you go?)
Looks like finally, somebody up there's got an eye on me
(You never need me)
Underground, chained and bound, suddenly I'm free
(You let me go)
I was lost, now I'm found but reason to be me

I was lost (what made you leave me?)
Now I'm found (what made you go?)
Looks like finally, somebody up there's got an eye on me
(You never need me)
Underground, chained and bound, suddenly I'm free
(You let me go)
I was lost, now I'm found but reason to be me

I was lost (what made you leave me?)
Now I'm found (what made you go?)
Looks like finally, somebody up there's got an eye on me
(You never need me)
Underground, chained and bound, suddenly I'm free
(You let me go)
I was lost, now I'm found but reason to be me
