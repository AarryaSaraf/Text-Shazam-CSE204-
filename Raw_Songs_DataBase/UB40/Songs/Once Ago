Lord
Oh yeah
Believe me
Oh yeah

Now once when I want you to go
My poor heart tell me no
But I can't stand it no more, my cup is overflown
Although it's you I once adored me
I need your love no more

So you can live your life, while I'll go on live mine
I wish you good luck and goodbye
I see you around some time
It's time that you should be wise
And take off your love disguise

Lord
Oh yeah
Yeah
Oh yeah

Now once when I want you to go
My poor heart tell me no
But I can't stand it no more, my cup is overflown
Although it's you I once adored
I need your loving no more

So you can live your life, while I'll go on live mine
I wish you good luck and goodbye
I see you around some time
It's time that you should be wise
And take off your love disguise (yeaeah)


Lord
Oh yeah
Believe me
Yeah yeah

So you can live your life, while I'll go on live mine
I wish you good luck and goodbye
I see you around some time
It's time that you should be wise
And take off your love's disguise (yeaeah)
