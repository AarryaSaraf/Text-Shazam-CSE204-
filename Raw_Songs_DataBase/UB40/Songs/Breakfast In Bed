You've been crying your face is a mess
Come in baby, you can wipe the tears on my dress
She's hurt you again, I can tell
I know that look so well


Don't be shy, we've been here before
Pull your shoes off,
And I will lock the door
And no-one has to know, I've come here again
Knowing it'll be like it's always been before



Breakfast in bed, kisses for me
You don't have to say you love me
Breakfast in bed, love can make you sing


What's your hurry, please don't hit and run
We can let her wait, my darling its been so long


Since you've had me here, I've returned again
Darling it will be like it's always been before
