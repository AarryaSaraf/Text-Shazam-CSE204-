Cherry, oh, cherry, oh, baby,

So, cherry, oh, cherry, oh, baby,
Don't you know I'm in love with you?
If you don't believe it's true,
What else is there for me to do?

Look how long I've been waiting,
For you to come right in.
And now that we are together,
Please make all my joys come over.

So, cherry, oh, cherry, oh, baby,
Don't you see I'm in love with you?
If you don't believe I do,
Then why don't you try me?

I will never let you down,
I will never make you wear no frown.
If you say that you love me madly,
Well, babe, I'll accept you gladly.
