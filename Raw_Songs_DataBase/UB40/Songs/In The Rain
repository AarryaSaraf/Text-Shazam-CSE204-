I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy but I
I wanna go outside in the rain

Cause I, I think I'm gonna cry
And I, I don't want you to see me cry

I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy but I
I wanna go outside in the rain

Once the rain starts falling on my face
And it won't see you keep a single trace
All the tears I'm crying, because of you I'm crying
Don't want you to see me cry, let me go, let me go, let me go

I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy but I
I wanna go outside in the rain

Once the sun comes out, rain has gone away
I know I'm gonna see a better day
Right now I think I'm crying, because of you I'm crying
Don't want you to see me cry, let me go, let me go, let me go

I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy but I
I wanna go outside in the rain
I wanna go outside in the rain
I wanna go outside in the rain
