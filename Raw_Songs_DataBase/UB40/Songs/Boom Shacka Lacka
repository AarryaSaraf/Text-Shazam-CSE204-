Come and gather round children
Lets get together and sing this song
Got to settle down children
Lets all join and sing this song sing it sing it

Boom shaka laka laka Boom boom boom 
Boom shaka laka laka Boom boom boom 
Boom shaka laka laka Boom boom boom 
Boom shaka laka laka Boom boom boom 

I'd like to take this time to thank you all
Thank you from the soul deep in my heart
Thank you for the love that's going around
We give it to you in some sweet sound
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

Boom shaka laka boom boom boom 
Dance the little children while I sing this song
Jump a little bit higher while I sing this song
Sing it boom shaka laka laka boom boom boom 
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Boom shaka laka laka boom boom boom
