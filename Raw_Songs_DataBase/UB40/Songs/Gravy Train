Musical ting call the Gravy Train
Can't afford to miss this train
Choo choo I said the train is coming
Choo choo I said the train is coming

Another day, another dollar
Feels like every day the same
And I've given it the best years of my life
For someone else to ride on that Gravy Train
And I say

Here comes the Gravy Train
You can hear that whistle blowing round the bend
You can hear the sound of laughing
As the Gravy Train is passing
But that Gravy Train it won't be stopping here

They say we're all in this together
But it gets harder every day
And if I work for a hundred years or more
I still won't get my seat on that Gravy Train
And I say

Here comes the Gravy Train
You can hear the whistle blowing round the bend
You can hear the sound of laughing
As the Gravy Train is passing
But that Gravy Train it won't be stopping here

Choo choo I said the train is coming
Choo choo I said the train is coming
Choo choo I said the train is coming
Put on some garments put on me suit
Diamond socks with criss clark shoes
Haff fi call taxi cause me nah miss the train
Miss it one time say me nah miss it again

Rich man living in his castle
Poor man begging at his gate
If we can only get up
And stand up for our rights
We can send them all to hell on that Gravy Train

Ya hear that!

Here comes the Gravy Train
You can hear the whistle blowing round the bend
And the carriages are burning
Just to keep the wheels turning
But that Gravy Train is running out of steam

Here comes the Gravy Train
You can hear the whistle blowing round the bend
You can hear the sound of laughing
As the Gravy Train is passing
But that Gravy Train it won't be stopping here

Here comes the Gravy Train
You can hear the whistle blowing round the bend
Choo Choo Choo Choo
You can hear the sound of laughing
As the Gravy Train is passing
But that Gravy Train it won't be stopping here

Wine to the left, wine to the right
Wine up front, wine a back
Wine a go down, two time
Step on the platform, right time
Right place, right line
It coulda rain, it coulda sunshine
Train it a come, 10.45
Na miss the train, not dis yah time
Choo choo I said the train is coming
Choo choo I said the train is coming
Choo choo I said the train is coming
Choo Choo Choo Choo
