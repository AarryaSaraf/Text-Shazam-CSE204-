I talk about her all day long
At work, it seems I do things wrong
Thinking of the girl I love
My ebony eyes

She is everything a girl should be
Sometimes I find it hard to see
Why she loves a guy like me
My ebony eyes

Sweet little ebony eyes
Girl that got me hypnotized

Talking about the girl I love
My ebony eyes

There will never be, anyone as good for me
She is the only girl I'll ever love
My ebony eyes

Sweet little ebony eyes
Girl that got me hypnotized

Talking about the girl I love
My ebony eyes

Sweetest little girl I love
My ebony eyes

Talking about the girl I love
My ebony eyes

Sweetest little girl I love
My ebony eyes

Sweet little ebony eyes

Talking about the girl I love
My ebony eyes

Sweet little ebony eyes

Sweetest little girl I love
My ebony eyes

Sweet little ebony eyes

Sweet little ebony eyes
