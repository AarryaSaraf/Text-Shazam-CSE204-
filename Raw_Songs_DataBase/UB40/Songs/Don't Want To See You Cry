I've got to tell you goodbye, babe
But I don't want to see you cry, babe
I'm leaving you behind
But it's just for a time

it's not my wish that we must part
Don't worry, baby, I won't break your heart
I'm going to a faraway land
I'm going to make a life for me and you
Please understand, girl

I've got to tell you goodbye, babe
But I don't want to see you cry, babe
I'm leaving you behind
But it's just for a time

Don't worry 'bout me when I am gone
Just tell yourself till I return
Don't fret yourself, don't cry too much
I'll soon be back with that magic touch, girl

I've got to tell you goodbye, babe
But I don't want to see you cry, babe
I'm leaving you behind
But it's just for a time

Don't worry, baby
Don't worry, baby

Don't worry 'bout me when I am gone
Just tell yourself till I return
Don't fret yourself, don't cry too much
I'll soon be back with that magic touch, girl

I've got to tell you goodbye, babe
But I don't want to see you cry, babe
I'm leaving you behind
But it's just for a time

Don't worry, baby
Don't worry, baby
