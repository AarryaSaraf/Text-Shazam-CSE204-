// Don't Want To See You Cry //

I've got to tell you goodbye, babe
But I don't want to see you cry, babe
I'm leaving you behind
But it's just for a time

it's not my wish that we must part
Don't worry, baby, I won't break your heart
I'm going to a faraway land
I'm going to make a life for me and you
Please understand, girl

I've got to tell you goodbye, babe
But I don't want to see you cry, babe
I'm leaving you behind
But it's just for a time

Don't worry 'bout me when I am gone
Just tell yourself till I return
Don't fret yourself, don't cry too much
I'll soon be back with that magic touch, girl

I've got to tell you goodbye, babe
But I don't want to see you cry, babe
I'm leaving you behind
But it's just for a time

Don't worry, baby
Don't worry, baby

Don't worry 'bout me when I am gone
Just tell yourself till I return
Don't fret yourself, don't cry too much
I'll soon be back with that magic touch, girl

I've got to tell you goodbye, babe
But I don't want to see you cry, babe
I'm leaving you behind
But it's just for a time

Don't worry, baby
Don't worry, baby

// Get Along Without You Now //

Aha mhmm gonna get along without you now
Aha mhmm I'm gonna get along without you now
You told me I was the latest thing
You even asked me to wear your ring
You ran around with every girl in town
You didn't even care if it got me down
Aha mhmm gonna get along without you now
Aha mhmm I'm gonna get along without you now
Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now
Thought I'd find somebody who was twice as cute
'Cos I didn't like you anyhow
You told everybody that we were friends
But this is where our friendship ends
'Cos all of a sudden you changed your tune
You haven't been around since way last June
Aa-ha-oo-hoo gonna get along without you now
I got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now
So long my honey
Goodbye my dear
Gonna get along without you now
Oo-hoo
Get darling without you now
Get darling without you now
Get darling without you now
Aha aha gonna get along without you now
Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now
So long my honey
Goodbye my dear
Gonna get along without you now
Oo-hoo hoo hoo
So loong my honey
Goodbye my dear
Gonna get along without you now
Oo-hoo hoo hoo hoo

// Cream Puff //

Take her if it has to be this way,
I know she doesnt really want to stay,
But be careful how you hold her,
Please dont ever scold her,
Shes my cream puff

We've been together a long, long time,
I know her ways and she knows mine,
So be careful how squeeze her,
Please dont ever tease her,
She's my cream puff

I pray to god above her,
She'll find another lover,
Who'll love her as much as I,

I only wanna make her happy,
Even though she made me cry.

If things go wrong,
Send her back to me,
I'll be as happy as I could be,
Cus I feel so lost without her,
All the things about her,
Shes my cream puff,

I pray to god above her,
She'll find another lover,
Who'll love her as much as I,

I only wanna see her happy,
Even though she made me cry...

If things go wrong send her back to me,
Id be as happy as I could be,
Cus I feel so lost without her,
All the things aout her,
Shes my cream puff

// Holiday //

Every day is just a holiday
I don't care what the crowd may say
I live the life I love, with you
Having fun while you were feeling blue

Every day is just another day
I do things the same old way
I swing and dine, I joke a while, play a while
'Cause every day is just a holiday

Every day is just a holiday
I don't care what the crowd may say
I live the life I love, with you
Having fun while you were feeling blue

Every day is just another day
I do things the same old way
I swing and dine, I joke a while, play a while
'Cause every day is just a holiday

Every day is just a holiday
I don't care what the crowd may say
I live the life I love, with you
Having fun while you were feeling blue

Every day is just another day
I do things the same old way
I swing and dine, I joke a while, play a while
'Cause every day is just a holiday

// Man Next Door //

There is a man that live next door
In my neighborhood
In my neighborhood
And he gets me down...

He gets in so late at night
Always a fuss and fight
Always a fuss and fight
All through the night

I've got to get away from here
This is not a place for me to stay
I've got to take my family
We'll find a quiet place

Hear the pots and pans they fall
Bang against my wall
Bang against my wall
No rest at all

He gets in so late at night
Always a fuss and fight
Always a fuss and fight
All through the night

I've got to get away from here
This is not a place for me to stay
I've got to take my family
We'll find a quiet place

// The Tracks Of My Tears //

People say I'm the life of the party
Because I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue

So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears..
I need you, need you

Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute
She's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one..

So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears..
I need you, need you

Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Just a clown oh yeah
Since you put me down
My smile is my make up
I wear since my break up with you..

So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

// Boom Shacka Lacka //

Come and gather round children
Lets get together and sing this song
Got to settle down children
Lets all join and sing this song sing it sing it

Boom shaka laka laka Boom boom boom [x4]

Jump a little bit higher while I sing this song
Sing it boom shaka laka laka boom boom boom [x4]
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Boom shaka laka laka boom boom boom [x4]

// You're Gonna Need Me //

The whole town talking 'bout
You and your new guy
You're flying and high
In your single world

But you're gonna need me
But you're gonna need me
You're gonna need me down here
And it won't be long

When you leave and say goodbye
Don't come back with tears in your eyes
You had a good lover once
But you didn't know

But you're gonna need me
But you're gonna need me
You're gonna need me down here
And it won't be long

The whole town talking 'bout
You and your new guy
You're flying and high
In your single world

But you're gonna need me
But you're gonna need me
You're gonna need me down here
And it won't be long

When you leave and say goodbye
Don't come back with tears in your eyes
You had a good lover once
But you didn't know

But you're gonna need me
But you're gonna need me
You're gonna need me down here
And it won't be long

// A Love I Can Feel //

I want a love I can feel
Thats the only kind of love I think is real
Don't wanna be going by something I heard
Coz baby actions speak louder than words

I want the love that is mine
In rain and snow and sun sun sun shine
A love to keep me warm when it's cold
That kind of loving that will never grow old

Don't you know I want a love
Don't you know I want a love
Don't you know I want a love
Don't you know I want a love

I want a love I can feel
That kind of loving you can give to me
The kind of kisses that can really be felt
That kind of loving that can make me melt

Don't you know I want a love
Don't you know I want a love
Don't you know I want a love
Don't you know I want a love
