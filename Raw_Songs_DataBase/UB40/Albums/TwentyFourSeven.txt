// End Of War //

Mankind must put an end to war
Or war will end Mankind.
Ask just who your fighting for
And who's the mastermind.
Question what we're doing here
How long can we sustain,
The guilt that feeds upon our fear
We've only got ourselves to blame.

It easy to be Bold and Brave
From a thousand miles away,
Its easy to pontificate
And live to fight another day. CHORUS
Its easy when the bullets
Are an Echo of a ricochet,
But the quickest way to end a war
Is drop your guns and walk away .

And once again we find ourselves
Upon the field of War
It seems like all our yesterdays
Are on repeat But furthermore,
It would appear we did'nt learn
The lessons of our past,
The war we fought to end all wars,
Secured a Peace that did'nt last

It easy to be Bold and Brave
From a thousand miles away,
Its easy to pontificate
And live to fight another day.
Its easy when the bullets
Are an Echo of a ricochet,
But the quickest way to end a war
Is drop your guns and walk away .

It easy to be Bold and Brave
From a thousand miles away,
Its easy to pontificate
And live to fight another day.
Its easy when the bullets
Are an Echo of a ricochet,
But the quickest way to end a war
Is drop your guns and walk away .

Mankind must put an end to war
Or war will end Mankind.
Ask just who your fighting for
And who's the mastermind.
Question what we're doing here
How long can we sustain,
The guilt that feeds upon our fear
We've only got ourselves to blame.

It easy to be Bold and Brave
From a thousand miles away,
Its easy to pontificate
And live to fight another day.
Its easy when the bullets
Are an Echo of a ricochet,
But the quickest way to end a war
Is drop your guns and walk away .

// Lost And Found //

Anybody could be me, you could be standing here
It's so very easy for me to disappear
No-one seems to see me; it's as if I don't exist
I'm going nowhere and I know I won't be missed

I was lost, now I'm found
Looks like finally, somebody up there's got an eye on me
Underground, chained and bound, suddenly I'm free
I was lost, now I'm found but reason to be me

Everyone is waiting, everyday is just the same
Everybody needs some happiness to counteract the pain
Maybe somewhere, someday, someone will notice me
I could find myself again and hope and dignity yeah

I was lost (what made you leave me?)
Now I'm found (what made you go?)
Looks like finally, somebody up there's got an eye on me
(You never need me)
Underground, chained and bound, suddenly I'm free
(You let me go)
I was lost, now I'm found but reason to be me

I was lost (what made you leave me?)
Now I'm found (what made you go?)
Looks like finally, somebody up there's got an eye on me
(You never need me)
Underground, chained and bound, suddenly I'm free
(You let me go)
I was lost, now I'm found but reason to be me

I was lost (what made you leave me?)
Now I'm found (what made you go?)
Looks like finally, somebody up there's got an eye on me
(You never need me)
Underground, chained and bound, suddenly I'm free
(You let me go)
I was lost, now I'm found but reason to be me

// Dance Until The Morning Light //

Wake up in the morning, pump this in your stereo
In your car or blaze this in your disco
People look confused, what is this yo
Hip-Hop, a little bit a Reggae in it

This one is for those who like the old school
They tried to hit on us in the school hall
Lets take it back to base and give it
Check this out, let me tell you how to do it

[Chorus x2:]
Let your body work, can you feel it jerk?
This one gonna make you move 'til your body hurts
We gonna dance until the morning light

Twist, shake, rattle n roll and keep it jiggy jiggy
All my girls them low and keep it freaky freaky
Let it loose. let it go when I spin it
Mister DJ, can you turn it up a little?

Get up off the wall and stop your posing
[?] stand there looking frozen
Come bust a move, the club is closing
Check this out now, let me tell you how to do it

[Chorus x2:]
Let your body work, can you feel it jerk?
This one gonna make you move 'til your body hurts
We gonna dance until the morning light

Break it down
This one is making me silly, it makes me jump around
Get down
People get on your feet; I don't want you sitting down
Break it down
Let's start the winding, start the grinding, let's just jump around
Get down
Cos good music always comes back around

Ask your grandmother and grandfather about this
How they were twisting and shaking when they first heard this
40 years later now they're back on the play list
We recycle it and now we're back in business

[Rap:]
We put this back in the pot
And now we're stirring it up
We add the sugar and a spice
And now we're making it hot
And now we're running your city
And yes we're running your block
[?]
And we're never gonna stop, so just...

[Chorus x4:]
Let your body work, can you feel it jerk?
This one gonna make you move 'til your body hurts
We gonna dance until the morning light

// This Is How It Is //

This is how it is
This is how it goes
You come into this world alone
And travel down this road
You try to do the best you can
But there's no guarantees
So one day you'll be flying high
The next down on your knees

[Chorus]
I guess were on our own
I know that's nothing new
Today is just a stepping stone
Along the avenue
Tomorrow I'll be coming home
I'll find a rendezvous
I'll run towards the great unknown
And drink the morning dew Ohhhhh

This is what's it's like
And how it is to choose
Were you stop along the way
And fix your worn out shoes
How to recognise a girl
Avoiding all her mates
Forget the things you thought you knew
You may as well again

[Chorus]
I guess were on our own
I know that's nothing new
Today is just a stepping stone
Along the avenue
Tomorrow I'll be coming home
I'll find a rendezvous
I'll run towards the great unknown
And drink the morning dew Ohhhhh

This is how it goes, This is how it fairs
When all the world is falling down
And dragging at your hair
This is what they say
If you should ask them why
The world is in a backward spin
You fall, you live, you die

[Chorus]
I guess were on our own
I know that's nothing new
Today is just a stepping stone
Along the avenue
Tomorrow I'll be coming home
I'll find a rendezvous
I'll run towards the great unknown
And drink the morning dew Ohhhhh

[Chorus]
I guess were on our own
I know that's nothing new
Today is just a stepping stone
Along the avenue
Tomorrow I'll be coming home
I'll find a rendezvous
I'll run towards the great unknown
And drink the morning dew Ohhhhh

// Rainbow Nation //

In our youthful condemned nation
The truth speaks for itself
That in a time of darkness
Someone cried for help
So we told a simple story
Of innocence and lies
How the truth became so twisted
In a single judge's eye

A brave new rainbow nation
Was floating on the tide
In a sea of expectation
And a humble sense of pride
But the wave of solidarity
That swept across our land
He's broken on the rocks
Left lifeless on the sand

It all seemed very simple
Let the guilty take the blame
We can sing our songs of freedom
And put them all to shame
Shine a light into the dark
Let them hear his name
But the more we try to change things
The more they stay the same

A brave new rainbow nation
Was floating on the tide
In a sea of expectation
And a humble sense of pride
But the wave of solidarity
That swept across our land
He's broken on the rocks
Left lifeless on the sand

No one else but Tyler
Knows exactly what he's missed
He's a man that's disappearance
Is slowly ceasing to exist
And the only contribution
That he has left to give
Is the simple tragic story
Of the life he's never lived

A brave new rainbow nation
Was floating on the tide
In a sea of expectation
And a humble sense of pride
But the wave of solidarity
That swept across our land
He's broken on the rocks
Left lifeless on the sand

// Here We Go Again //

We've lost our way and don't know which way to turn
Here we go again
We put trust in great man and still we get burnt
Here we go again
Why do we fall for the same old lines?
Why do we fall for it time after time?
We've lost our way inadvertently
[?]
So dark that we can't see
[?]
I'm talking you and me
You've lost your pride and don't know when it began
Here we go again
You sit in judgement over your fellow men
Here we go again
Why do you fall for the same old lines?
Why do you fall for it time after time?
You've lost your pride inadvertently
To scared to talk
Too scared to look and see
Too scared to walk
Too scared to run to me
To scared to talk
Too scared to look and see
Too scared to walk
Too scared to run to me
We've gone too far and don't know where it will end
Here we go again
We've eaten up nature
And were gonna get burned
Here we go again
Why do we choose to leave no warning signs?
Why do we do it time after time?
We've gone to too far inadvertently
No where to run as far as I can see
Nowhere to run
No end for you and me
Too scared to talk
Too scared to look and see
Too scared to walk
To scared to run to me
To scared to to scared to to scared to talk
To scared to to scared to to scared to talk

// I Shot The Sheriff //

I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot no deputy, oh no! Oh!
I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot no deputy, ooh, ooh, oo-ooh.)
Yeah! All around in my home town,
They're tryin' to track me down;
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy,
For the life of a deputy.
But I say:

Oh, now, now. Oh!
(I shot the sheriff.) - the sheriff.
(But I swear it was in selfdefence.)
Oh, no! (Ooh, ooh, oo-oh) Yeah!
I say: I shot the sheriff - Oh, Lord! -
(And they say it is a capital offence.)
Yeah! (Ooh, ooh, oo-oh) Yeah!

Sheriff John Brown always hated me,
For what, I don't know:
Every time I plant a seed,
He said kill it before it grow -
He said kill them before they grow.
And so:

Read it in the news:
(I shot the sheriff.) Oh, Lord!
(But I swear it was in self-defence.)
Where was the deputy? (Oo-oo-oh)
I say: I shot the sheriff,
But I swear it was in selfdefence. (Oo-oh) Yeah!

Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town, yeah!
All of a sudden I saw sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down,
So I shot - I shot - I shot him down and I say:
If I am guilty I will pay.

(I shot the sheriff,)
But I say (But I didn't shoot no deputy),
I didn't shoot no deputy (oh, no-oh), oh no!
(I shot the sheriff.) I did!
But I didn't shoot no deputy. Oh! (Oo-oo-ooh)

Reflexes had got the better of me
And what is to be must be:
Every day the bucket a-go a well,
One day the bottom a-go drop out,
One day the bottom a-go drop out.
I say:

I - I - I - I shot the sheriff.
Lord, I didn't shot the deputy. Yeah!
I - I (shot the sheriff) -
But I didn't shoot no deputy, yeah! No, yeah!

// Oh America //

[Chorus:]
Oh America, land of the free
Your flag is flying, but it looks dirty to me
Oh America, home of the brave
Anywhere you go you're leaving too many graves

The chest is so big but the brain is too small
The whole world's crying out 'just stop the wars'
Don't care about the climate, don't care about the poor
You don't seem to care about too much at all

You say you're with God but you wield Satan's sword
With kangaroo courts you just make up your laws
No human rights oh yes we know the score
The bogey man is close, he may live next door

When the floods came down it showed all your old traits
Condemned your own people on the basis of race
Why leave vulnerable people in a vulnerable place?
Its a crying shame, it's a freaking disgrace

I say the government man, them seem to get it wrong
Them seem to make a whole heap of bad decision
Time fe good Americans to stand up strong
Like the friends over there we know for so long
Stand up firm, me say, stand up strong
Time fe mek a new day, we no love Babylon
Me say, stand up firm, me say, stand up strong
Time fe mek a new day, we no love Babylon

// Once Around //

[Chorus:]
Once around was all I ever needed
And in my dreams you take me by the hand
And I know that you will be with me forever
As the wheel takes us both once more around

Once around the wheel begins revolving
Our bodies slowly lifted from the crowd
The hustle of the city's slowly fading
And the heartbeat is the only living sound

[Chorus:]
Once around was all I ever needed
And in my dreams you take me by the hand
And I know that you will be with me forever
As the wheel takes us both once more around

We slowly watch the night give way to morning
And hope we can suspend ourselves in time
And some I'll make these moments last forever
And leave the ones who need us for behind

Once around is all I have to give you
Close your eyes you don't have to make a sound
By the time it takes this wheel to stop revolving
There's something that you need to understand

[Chorus:]
Once around was all I ever needed
And in my dreams you take me by the hand
And I know that you will be with me forever
As the wheel takes us both once more around

// Slow Down //

You might believe, and still you feel the chase has just begun.
That you must reach that horizon before the setting of the sun.
You chase the light in front of you, nightfall close behind.
If you stop to catch your breath, you know what you will find.

Don't slow down don't touch the ground.
You know what you will find.
That old grey man in tattered clothes following behind.

No time to stop, don't go to sleep, prepare to pay the cost.
The hours and minutes are passing by, another day is lost.
Impatience is a virtue, catch me if you can.
The seconds have been ticking by since your life began.

// Instant Radical Change Of Perception //

It's the stuff we think we know
That stops us all from learning
It's the wood that needs to grow
That keeps your fires burning

You can educate a fool
You can wrap him up in learning
You can read him all rules
But you can never make him think

[Chorus:]
With an instant radical change of perception
A hundred and eighty degrees in direction
Inoculate against the infection
And set a new course on a brand new trajection
In a brand new direction

It's the greenhouse that we're heating
That makes tomorrow colder
And doomsday drums are beating
A tattoo upon your shoulder

You can educate a fool
He could be a title holder
You could read him all the rules
But you can never make him think

[Chorus:]
With an instant radical change of perception
A hundred and eighty degrees in direction
Inoculate against the infection
And set a new course on a brand new trajection

In a brand new direction
A change of perception
On a brand new trajection

// I'll Be There //

I never promised you romance
I never said that I would dance
And I'm not learning

I never said I'd buy you rings
I never promised you a thing
And I'm not turning

[Chorus:]
But I would put no one above you
And you will always know I care
As long as you let me love you
I'll be there

You ask me could I love you more
There's only you that I adore
But you're not believing

Nor would I ever break your heart
I couldn't bear to be apart
So I'm not leaving

[Chorus:]
Cos I would put no one above you
And you will always know I care
As long as you let me love you
I'll be there

// The Road //

The roadmap to freedom
Translates as a fake
Handshakes and mistakes
Turned into heartaches
When losers have lost
All their give and their take
and check a mistake turn to heartache

[Chorus:]
Five hundred thousand forced to flee
A million square miles of emergency
Another two million will go hungry
When there's no guarantee for the refugee

The road from Darfur
Runs red with denial
Waterless mile
After waterless mile
Barefooted fear
Kicks the dust of exile
Waterless mile
After waterless mile

[Chorus:]
Five hundred thousand forced to flee
A million square miles of emergency
Another two million will go hungry
When there's no guarantee for the refugee

The road out of Gaza
As plagued with lost souls
Buried in holes
By the border patrols
What claims we've give them
They cannot control
Drown in the holes
In their land of lost souls
