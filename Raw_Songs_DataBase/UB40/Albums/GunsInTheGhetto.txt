// Always There //

I'm running away
I've got to get home
I'm lost in a crowd
But I'm still on my own
I'm looking ahead
So I'm staying behind
I'm not being cruel
I'm just being kind

I close my eyes
It's no surprise
I'm always there
Can't count the times
I've tried to hide
And found nowhere

I'm trying to lay low
But I keep getting high
My feet on the ground
Got my head in the sky
My eye on the future
That's stuck in the past
I find I can't lose
When I aim to come last

I realise
It's no surprise
That nothing's clear
That black is white
That day is night
And there is here

I'm right on the ball
But I'm missing the mark
I burn in the sun
I'm scared of the dark
Got an ivory tower
With a bird's eye view
Got plenty of time
But nothing to do

The best disguise
It's no surprise
Is disappear
Can't count the times
I've tried to hide
And found nowhere

I'm running away
I've got to get home
I'm lost in a crowd
But I'm still on my own
I'm looking ahead
So I'm staying behind
I'm not being cruel
I'm just being kind

I realise
It's no surprise
That nothing's clear
That black is white
That day is night
And there is here

The best disguise
It's no surprise
Is disappear
Can't count the times
I've tried to hide
And found nowhere

I close my eyes
It's no surprise
I'm always there
Can't count the times
I've tried to hide
And found nowhere

I realise
It's no surprise
That nothing's clear
That black is white
That day is night
And there is here

The best disguise
It's no surprise
Is disappear
Can't count the times
I've tried to hide
And found nowhere

// Hurry Come On Up //

[Chorus:]
Hey, you, hurry come up
See how fast you come down
You run up your mouth
You run out of luck
You're running out of town

Hurry come up now you're all alone
You had to kick dirt on your stepping stone
You lost your way across the land
Foundations crumble built on shifting sand

[Chorus]

Hurry come up in the blink of an eye
You crowned yourself king of the castle high
You'll never get to heaven if you tell a lie
There's a hole in your bucket and your well's run dry

[Chorus]

Hurry come up we've got nothing to say
We sit back and watch you give yourself away
Where's all the power now they've pulled the plug
You're up to your neck in the hole you dug

[Chorus]

Hurry come up your edges are rough
We need a little love ain't life tough enough
There's no coming back your ticket's one way
Your journey don't start till judgement day

[Chorus]

Hurry come up just a fast as you can
Time's running out for your master plan
Cards on the table enough is enough
They hold the aces now they call your bluff

[Chorus]

Hurry come up when you turn off the light
How do you sleep in your bed at night
It's all a bad dream but no-one can hear
You only have yourself to fear

[Chorus]
