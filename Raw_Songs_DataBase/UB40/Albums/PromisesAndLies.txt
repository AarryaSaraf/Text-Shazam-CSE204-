Album: PromisesAndLies

// C'est La Vie //

A woman came and said to me
She'd seen a lady sell her baby
For ten or twenty dollars maybe
And everybody thinks she's crazy
They're too blind to see
She never failed to call attention
To the things we never mention
Real horror, daily, courtesy of your TV
C'est La Vie

[Chorus:]
A woman came and said to me
Now listen very carefully
There's brother killing brother
People living on their knees
Biting sugar coated bullets
For the pain of this disease
C'est La Vie

A woman came and said to me
She had a husband on an island
Found his body on a wasteland
Soldiers came and took him
Just to torture her you see
All alone she mourned her lover
Crossed the sea to find a brother
Maybe he could help her get her baby back for free
C'est La Vie

[Chorus]

// Desert Sand //

You tell me there's no darkness
While the sun shines down on you
And just because your life is peaceful
There's no fighting left to do
For every cup that runneth over
Many more are filled with pain
You talk to me of sunshine
When it's pouring down with rain

Just because you can't see it
Doesn't mean it isn't there
Just because it can't touch you
Doesn't mean you shouldn't care
For every life that's lit with love
Many more are racked with pain
You talk to me of sunshine
When it's pouring down with rain

It's a long black night, good people
Descended on our land
Share your light
Make a flower grow
In the desert sand

// Promises And Lies //

All the sorrow and the pain
All the sacrifice in vain
I was much too blind to see
You make a loser out of me
You put me down for oh so long
While you sang your serpent's song

The rest is history
You can do no more to me
I've been down so low
Had nowhere left to go
I could see it in your eyes
All your promises were lies
Promises and lies

Your cut was quick and deep
But then you thought you'd never need a friend
But all things change, and tides must turn
And you let all your bridges burn
Too many fatal wounds to heal

The rest is history
You can do no more to me
I've been down so low
Had nowhere left to go
I could see it in your eyes
All your promises were lies
Promises and lies

// Reggae Music //

I said we friendship come first, the band did come second
And that's why I decided to put it in a song
So listen crowd of people and throw up unnu hands
If you love dem their style and you love dem pattern

Reggae music can't refuse it
So give us what we want and mek we gwan

I said yes crowd of people we come back again
I man Thriller E. And all me best best friends
I know most of dem from age eleven
And some of dem even before then
We travel the whole world, think it could never end
But don't get me wrong it a no big problem
'Cos reggae what we love and that's what we defend
And that there love that could a never end

Reggae music can't refuse it
So give us what we want and mek we gwan.

So let me get back to the subject of me friends
'Cos me respect and love love the whole of them.
And that there love that could a never end.
And now it is time to hail the whole of them

Buttons pon the bone, Patrick him a hit the high c

And that only leaves me and Jimmy

And that is the whole of UB40

Reggae music can't refuse it
So give us what we want and mek we gwan.

// Now And Then //

Now and then
I must admit I wonder if I had the chance
To vanquish foes with nothing more than just a glance
How perfect every single day would be

To never wait in driving rain
For the bus that never came
Not to be the one to blame
For anybody else's misery

Now and then
I contemplate a different way around this day
With nothing more than simple words, so I can say
I'm quite content and happy being me

Walking tall with peace of mind
To leave no childhood dreams behind
Arriving home to always find
Things just as I know they ought to be

Now And Then
I must admit I wonder if I had the chance
To vanquish foes with nothing more than just a glance
How perfect every single day would be
To never wait in driving rain
For the bus that never came
Not to be the one to blame
For anybody else's misery

Now and then
I wake up, when it hits me like a ton of bricks
I realise it's me who has to take the licks
No angels up there looking after me
No rainbow with a pot of gold
No cloak to shield me from the cold
No pill to stop me growing old
Dreams fading into stark reality

// Things Ain't Like They Used To Be //

Are you wondering why
No one talks any more
And all you hear
Is the cry for war
Are you wondering if
There are people who
Hurt inside the same as you

There are grey-faced men always telling me
Things ain't like they used to be
You kids have got no self respect
Wake up old man to your neglect
It's dog eat dog
It's hand to mouth
It's east and west
It's north and south
Just like you drummed it into me
Things ain't like they used to be

I'll tell you why I can't afford
To hang my hopes upon your word
And when I'm done, I'll join the queue
And take my chance, no thanks to you
It's in or out
It's stop and go
It isn't what
It's who you know
I've heard you, now can you hear me
Things ain't like they used to be

Ancient rules for ancient men
But this is now and that was then
Don't lay your heavy hand on me
And sink me in your poison sea
It's us and them
It's me and you
It's guessing games
It's what to do
Exactly like you said to me
Things ain't like they used to be

Are you wondering why
No one talks any more
And all you hear
Is the cry for war
Are you wondering if
There are people who
Hurt inside the same as you

// It's A Long Long Way //

It's a long long way from here
Don't you worry yourself my dear
It's a long long way from here

Drought and famine in TV land
Read the sunday papers credit card ina your hand
Sing your song of freedom just to ease your troubled mind
And save your guilty pennies for the ones you leave behind

The burden that you carry from the cradle to the grave
Is like a badge of honour that you wear upon your sleeve
You make your contribution and you shed a little tear
And stage your celebration just to show how much you care

You obscure your stolen power with hypocrisy and lies
Your talk of understanding is a wafer thin disguise
You glorify my image but deny me flesh and blood
You radiate with goodness when you here me beg for food

Those rivers of blood will flow again
Someone changed the lyrics but the song remains the same
You can build a wall of protocol to keep the wolves at bay
But history dictates that someone has to pay

It's a long long way from here
Don't you worry yourself my dear
It's a long long way from here

// Sorry //

Please don't say sorry
Presuming a respect for what you say
If in your heart you mean it
Then you'll understand me feeling
You must prove it; sign the cheque without delay
Most humbly yours, four hundred years back pay

[Chorus:]
I'm not begging charity
Don't confuse the things I say
Give me what belongs to me
Give me what belongs to me

Just don't say sorry
As if that can excuse this tyranny
No value in your talking
Money speaks and bullshit's walking
Round in circles re-inventing history
Trying to erase our memory

[Chorus]

If you say sorry
Can I assume you've realised the shame
The seeds of your oppression
Fall and ripen with aggression
You can't hold us any longer with your chains
Time to compensate us for our claims

Don't bother wi' no sorry
Don't bother wi' delay
A four hundred years
Is not just the other day

I'm not begging charity
Don't confuse up your mind
Payment overdue
Fe a long long time

You come a we gate
No bother hesitate
You tek away we tings
Like a damn pirate
