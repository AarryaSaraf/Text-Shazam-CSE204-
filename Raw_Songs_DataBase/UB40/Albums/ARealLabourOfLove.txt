// Making Love //

Whoooooo oooo

Waiting for me
To come round
And lay my body down
To make love
Making love, making love

And a river so deep soawhoa deep
And a mountain so high so high so high
And the valley so low

To come round
And lay my body down
To make love

And a river so deep so deep sooo deep
And a mountain so high so high so high
I says she's waiting
I know she's waiting
She's waiting foraworawor foraworawor foraworawor me
Yes she is

To lay my body down
To make love
Making love, making love, making love making love

// She Loves Me Now //

She loves me now
And that just means I can't complain
She loves me now
And I must admit I feel the same

Listen now
Early one Sunday morning
As I took up my paper and decided to read
The phone rang with a little voice saying

"You might not remember me but I had one dance with you
And ever since the night we met, I must tell you true
You danced into my life, drove me out of my mind
Now between me and my man it's all over"

That's what she said
"I just want us now to get closer"
She loves me now
That just means I can't complain
She loves me now
And I must admit I feel the same

I knew something special would have to come out
'Cause the way with the woman there was no doubt
We would have to see eachother and it would not be long
Before we'd hit it off with a love that's strong, strong, strong

And I know someone out there is hurt, but got to get it on
It's natural that we were meant for each other
If you run your life the way you dance
I'd be proud of that night I made my advance

She loves me now
And that just means I can't complain
She loves me now
And I must admit I feel the same
She loves me now
After the night we danced on the floor
She loves me now

// How Could I Leave //

Wow ho ho yeah yeah
Wow ho now now
Oh oh yeah, yeah

How could I leave
How could I possibly go on
If you should say goodbye
Just like a rose
If you don't water it every morn
It withers and it dies

Promise you won't leave me
Promise you won't hurt me
Promise you won't ever make me blue
If you ever leave me, If you should desert me
Baby I don't know just what I'd do
I don't know just what I'd do
I really don't know just I'd do
Wow ho ho

It was ordained that man should leave his mother and cling
To the woman that he loves (Umm, yeah)
I'm very sure, that I could never love anyone
The way I love you now

Oh oh yeah
Wow ho ho ho
How could I, how could I baby
Wow yeah, yeah
Wow now now oh oh yeah... oh yeah

It was ordained that man should leave his mother and cling
To the woman that he loves (Umm, yeah)
I'm very sure, that I could never love anyone
The way I love you now

Oh oh yeah
Wow ho ho ho
How could I, how could I baby
Wow yeah, yeah
Wow now now oh oh yeah... oh yeah

// Ebony Eyes //

I talk about her all day long
At work, it seems I do things wrong
Thinking of the girl I love
My ebony eyes

She is everything a girl should be
Sometimes I find it hard to see
Why she loves a guy like me
My ebony eyes

Sweet little ebony eyes
Girl that got me hypnotized

Talking about the girl I love
My ebony eyes

There will never be, anyone as good for me
She is the only girl I'll ever love
My ebony eyes

Sweet little ebony eyes
Girl that got me hypnotized

Talking about the girl I love
My ebony eyes

Sweetest little girl I love
My ebony eyes

Talking about the girl I love
My ebony eyes

Sweetest little girl I love
My ebony eyes

Sweet little ebony eyes

Talking about the girl I love
My ebony eyes

Sweet little ebony eyes

Sweetest little girl I love
My ebony eyes

Sweet little ebony eyes

Sweet little ebony eyes

// A Place In The Sun //

Like a long lonely stream I keep runnin' towards a dream
Movin' on, movin' on
Like a branch on a tree I keep reachin' to be free
Movin' on, movin' on

There's a place in the sun where there's hope for every one
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
Theres' a place in the sun and before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun

Like an old dusty road
I get weary from the load
Movin' on, movin' on
Like this tired troubled earth
I've been rollin' since my birth
Movin' on, movin' on

There's a place in the sun where there's hope for every one
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
Theres' a place in the sun and before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun

// Once Ago //

Lord
Oh yeah
Believe me
Oh yeah

Now once when I want you to go
My poor heart tell me no
But I can't stand it no more, my cup is overflown
Although it's you I once adored me
I need your love no more

So you can live your life, while I'll go on live mine
I wish you good luck and goodbye
I see you around some time
It's time that you should be wise
And take off your love disguise

Lord
Oh yeah
Yeah
Oh yeah

Now once when I want you to go
My poor heart tell me no
But I can't stand it no more, my cup is overflown
Although it's you I once adored
I need your loving no more

So you can live your life, while I'll go on live mine
I wish you good luck and goodbye
I see you around some time
It's time that you should be wise
And take off your love disguise (yeaeah)


Lord
Oh yeah
Believe me
Yeah yeah

So you can live your life, while I'll go on live mine
I wish you good luck and goodbye
I see you around some time
It's time that you should be wise
And take off your love's disguise (yeaeah)

Lord
Oh yeah
Believe me
Oh yeah

Lord
Oh yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah

Lord
Oh yeah
Believe me
Oh yeah

// In The Rain //

I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy but I
I wanna go outside in the rain

Cause I, I think I'm gonna cry
And I, I don't want you to see me cry

I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy but I
I wanna go outside in the rain

Once the rain starts falling on my face
And it won't see you keep a single trace
All the tears I'm crying, because of you I'm crying
Don't want you to see me cry, let me go, let me go, let me go

I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy but I
I wanna go outside in the rain

Once the sun comes out, rain has gone away
I know I'm gonna see a better day
Right now I think I'm crying, because of you I'm crying
Don't want you to see me cry, let me go, let me go, let me go

I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy but I
I wanna go outside in the rain
I wanna go outside in the rain
I wanna go outside in the rain
