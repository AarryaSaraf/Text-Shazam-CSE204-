// The Keeper //

I kiss the hand that holds my heart, so tender it's embrace
I kiss your eyes and read the love that's written on your face
I kiss the lips that kiss me back and take me to that place
Where loneliness and discontent are gone without a trace

I will be your comfort, whenever you're in pain
I will be your shelter, from the wind and rain
I will be your beacon, to guide you home again
And you will be the keeper of my heart
And you will be the keeper of my heart

I love the one who holds my heart, she fills my world with light
She makes a bright and sunny day, from dark and fear filled night
She takes whatever's wrong for me and tries to make it right
So heartache pain and misery are gone without a fight

I will lift your spirit, whenever you are blue
I will be your constant, when no one else is true
I will always be the friend you need to get you through
And you will be the keeper of my heart
And you will be the keeper of my heart

// Broken Man //

Broken tears running down my face
Broken heart beating out of pace
Broken dreams shattered on the ground
Broken words, no words to be found!

Broken promises lost on the wind
Broken life broken from within
Broken love money just can't buy
Broken world, passing each one by

Broken smile fading like the sun
Broken man who's loving no one
Broken song that no one will sing
Broken forever, lost everything

No one to hold
No one to kiss
No life to live
No one to hold
No one to kiss
No life to live
My still heart's broken!

Broken tears running down my face
Broken heart beating out of pace
Broken dreams shattered on the ground
Broken words, no words to be found!

Broken promises lost on the wind
Broken life broken from within
Broken love money just can't buy
Broken world, passing each one by

Broken smile fading like the sun
Broken man who's loving no one
Broken song that no one will sing
Broken forever, lost everything

No one to hold
No one to kiss
No life to live
No one to hold
No one to kiss
No life to live

We living in isolation
So it set from day one
Even family members dem
No have no communication
What a situation
'Nuff no have no education
Taken from our homeland
We need some reparation
To stop the starvation
Of the population
Looking for elevation
'Nough run to the congregation
In need of meditation
Mental stimulation
Herbal medication
To stop the inflammation
I'm spreading information
To each and every nation
What a tribulation
Inna dis iration
We yodding from creation
We don't need no immigration
Break down the boarders 'dem
That we all a wait 'pon
Lord

No one to hold
No one to kiss
No life to live
No one to hold
No one to kiss
No life to live
My still heart's broken!

// Gravy Train //

Musical ting call the Gravy Train
Can't afford to miss this train
Choo choo I said the train is coming
Choo choo I said the train is coming

Another day, another dollar
Feels like every day the same
And I've given it the best years of my life
For someone else to ride on that Gravy Train
And I say

Here comes the Gravy Train
You can hear that whistle blowing round the bend
You can hear the sound of laughing
As the Gravy Train is passing
But that Gravy Train it won't be stopping here

They say we're all in this together
But it gets harder every day
And if I work for a hundred years or more
I still won't get my seat on that Gravy Train
And I say

Here comes the Gravy Train
You can hear the whistle blowing round the bend
You can hear the sound of laughing
As the Gravy Train is passing
But that Gravy Train it won't be stopping here

Choo choo I said the train is coming
Choo choo I said the train is coming
Choo choo I said the train is coming
Put on some garments put on me suit
Diamond socks with criss clark shoes
Haff fi call taxi cause me nah miss the train
Miss it one time say me nah miss it again

Rich man living in his castle
Poor man begging at his gate
If we can only get up
And stand up for our rights
We can send them all to hell on that Gravy Train

Ya hear that!

Here comes the Gravy Train
You can hear the whistle blowing round the bend
And the carriages are burning
Just to keep the wheels turning
But that Gravy Train is running out of steam

Here comes the Gravy Train
You can hear the whistle blowing round the bend
You can hear the sound of laughing
As the Gravy Train is passing
But that Gravy Train it won't be stopping here

Here comes the Gravy Train
You can hear the whistle blowing round the bend
Choo Choo Choo Choo
You can hear the sound of laughing
As the Gravy Train is passing
But that Gravy Train it won't be stopping here

Wine to the left, wine to the right
Wine up front, wine a back
Wine a go down, two time
Step on the platform, right time
Right place, right line
It coulda rain, it coulda sunshine
Train it a come, 10.45
Na miss the train, not dis yah time
Choo choo I said the train is coming
Choo choo I said the train is coming
Choo choo I said the train is coming
Choo Choo Choo Choo

// I'm Alright Jack //

Don't you give me your hard luck story
I don't care now you voted for me
I know austerity's breaking your back
But I'm alright Jack

Don't complain that there's no state housing
I've bought mine made a profit of thousands
There's not many left but I can't help that
But I'm alright Jack

I'm alright Jack, I'm alright Jack

I'm doing ok, there's no more to say
Everything's going just fine
You're struggling I know but even so
I'm sick of hearing you whine

Don't you tell me you can't get a house
I've got two and I'm renting one out
Ok private landlords are holding you back
But I'm alright Jack

Don't start moaning I don't pay taxes
All of my scams they are legal practise
I'm entitled you can't have it back
And I'm alright Jack

I'm alright Jack, I'm alright Jack

I'm doing ok, there's no more to say
Everything's going just fine
Your struggling I know but even so
You don't have to moan all the time

Hey Mr MP how you a gwarn so
You dun know your job is to feed the people
How come you a feed off of the people
Selassie I know your time coming rude boy
Some questions for you answer ya know
Big and too rich man cha

It must be nice to be able to the buy house where you want
It must be nice to be able to the buy car where you want
It must be nice to be able to the book the flight where you want
And fly around the world and do what ever you want
It must be nice to be able to the book the hotel where you want
Nice to be able to the call the cab when you want
It must be nice to be able to the book the best restaurant
And eat and drink whatever you feel for and want

I'm doing ok, there's no more to say
Everything's going just fine
You're struggling I know but even so
I'm sick of hearing you whine

Don't you tell me you can't get a house
I've got two and I'm renting one out
Ok private landlords are holding you back
But I'm alright Jack

Don't start moaning I don't pay taxes
All of my scams they are legal practise
I'm entitled you can't have it back
And I'm alright Jack

I'm alright Jack, I'm alright Jack
I'm alright Jack, I'm alright Jack
I'm alright Jack, I'm alright Jack
