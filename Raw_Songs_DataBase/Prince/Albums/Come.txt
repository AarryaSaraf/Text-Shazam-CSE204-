Like a (Come) splendid, open ended
Celibate friend (No more will U cry), pretending
Not 2 know (Come) it (know it) when I blow it (blow it)
In your eyes (Here's a reason why)
Like a strawberry (Come), chocolate

I never been 1 2 hide my feelings
Baby, u blow my mind
I painted your face upon my ceiling
I stare at it all the time

I imagine myself inside your bedroom
Oh I imagine myself in your sky
(U) U are the reason there's bass in my boom
(Oh u) U are the reason I'm high

If u and I were just ten feet closer
Then I'd make u understand
That everything I wanna do 2 your body, baby
I would do 2 your head
Then u'd be hip 2 the deep rush
Deeper than the boom of the bass
With every other flick of the pink plush
The closer we get 2 the space (The closer we get 2 the space)

Don't u want 2 go? (The space)
Where the souls go (The space)
Where the tears flow (The space)
Where the love grows
Do u want 2 go?

I never been 1 4 this thing obsession
But just keep your eye on my hips
The circles they may be my confession
Just say the word and I'll strip

I've had dreams of us cuddling on the planet mars
Then when i wake up, I'm all covered in sex
With eyes that fall somewhere between rubies and stars
Don't look at me baby or I'll flex

If u and I were just ten feet closer
Then I'd make u understand
That everything I wanna do 2 your body, baby
I would do 2 your head
Then u'd be hip 2 the deep rush
Deeper than the boom of the bass

// Pheromone //

Come
Lie down beneath my shadow
Lie down beneath my shadow with great delight
And your feel will be sweet 2 me
Come
My left hand under your head,
While my right embraces time
Therein, my virgin, love's wine

L is 4 lust
O is 4 obsession
V is 4 the vast way u envelop my soul
This is crazy, this is crazy
I could die from the pheromone

I can see the castle
I can see the throne
I can see the beloved and she's not alone
But it's cool like that
Cuz I'll be diggin' her just the same
I can see the curtain wrestled from the wall
I can see her hands tied
I can see it all
He pulls a gat
This is how they play the game
And I'm 'round the the back
Cuz curiosity it knows no shame

Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, controllin' my every motion
Pheromone, I'm helpless as a pet
Pheromone, when your body's wet

I can feel the tension through the crack in the door
He begs 4 love, while she's disgusted more
And I'm on fire, cause I never seen her nude before
I wanna save her (save her)
I want 2 watch (watch)
All my vital signs go up a couple of notches
When he unties her and she runs 2 the open door
He trips and grinds her (grinds her)
Right there all on the floor (on the floor)
She so close I can touch her (touch her)

Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, controllin' my every motion
Pheromone, I'm helpless as a pet
Pheromone, when your body's wet (body's wet, body's wet, body's wet)

Her eyes are closed but there's no penetration
He just makes her point the pistol 2 his nose
While he masturbates and now I see a tear
Heading down towards her smile
What happens next it all depends upon your style

(Oh, this is crazy baby)

Pheromone, (Pheromone) rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, (Pheromone) controllin' my every motion
Pheromone, I'm helpless as a pet
Pheromone, (Pheromone) when your body's wet (body's wet)
Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, controllin' my every motion

I don't really wanna go crazy but I'm helpless as a pet
When I see your naked body's wet (when your body's wet,body's wet)
(Pheromone) When I see your naked body's wet
(Pheromone) When I see your naked body's wet (body's wet, body's wet)
(Pheromone) But I'm helpless as a pet
(Pheromone) When I see your naked
Baby, when your body's wet (body's wet, body's wet)

// Papa //

There was 1 September day that Papa worked 2 hard
First he crucified every dandelion out in the yard
Then he screamed at baby twice 4 throwin' rocks at passin' cars
Baby didn't listen, so like a priceless work of art
He got snatched by his Papa who then opened up the closet door
And pushed the four-year-old down, onto the closet floor
Baby cried "I'm sorry, I won't do it no more"
Papa said "Yeah, I know, that's what this here's 4"
Smack!
Ooh Papa...
Smack! Smack!
Ooh Papa...Papa...
Smack!
Ooh Papa...
Smack! Smack!
Ooh Papa...Papa...

As the door closes, baby starts 2 cry
"Please don't lock me up again, without a reason why"
Papa just went outside and pointed a shotgun up in the sky
He said "How come I don't love my woman?"
Then he took aim and died

Boom!
Papa...
Boom! Boom!
Papa...Papa
Boom!
Papa...
Boom! Boom!
Papa...Papa...

Don't abuse children, or else they turn out like me

Fair 2 partly crazy, deep down we're all the same
Every single 1 of us knows some kind of pain
In the middle of all that's crazy, this 1 fact still remains
If u love somebody, your life won't be in vain
And there's always a rainbow, at the end of every rain

// Race //

Lie down, fair 1, and come away
Till the rain is over and gone
G-G-Gimme the beat now (Face the music)
Lead line (Face the music)

If the air is a little thick in this room 2nite
I reckon it's the result of an onslaught of separatist rookies
Overcome by this colorful sight

Talkin' so fast that even they
Talkin' so fast that even they
Don't know what they mean

Of all the things that base a rhyme
How is it that U everytime
Regurgitate the racist lines that keep us apart?

Thank God this ain't Monopoly
U'd make us all go back 2 start

Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Race
Face the music
We all bones when we dead

Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Cut me, cut U
Both the blood is red

I gotcha

Race
Race

Check it

Three seats over there's a lady black
Entrusted 2 her care is a little white girl
And the fact of the matter is

Before her momma or another kid at school
Tells her about the fallacy that 1 race rules over the other
She'd be a much-better-off-left fool (Face the music)

If we never heard about the evils that those before us committed
Then how my dear, tell me now how my dear, tell me now how now would we know

And then the band say

Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Race
Face the music
We all bones when we dead

Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Cut me, cut U
Both the blood is red

I gotcha

Race
Race
(Face the music)

D-d-down with H-I-S-T-O-R-Y and all this BS propagandi
Keepin U from me and me from U as we grow
I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
Why those before us hated each other

I'd rather believe they never did
I'd rather believe (I'd rather, I'd rather believe)
That there's hope 4 a kid

And if he imitates the best
I guess that's what I'll try 2 be
And I will let the rest dissolve with my guitar underneath the sea

Race
(Face Face Face Face Face)
Face the music (Face the music)
Face the music

Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Race
Face the music
We all bones when we dead

Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Cut me, cut U
Both the blood is red

Get it?
Race
Got it

Race
Face the music
Race Race
(Face Face Face the music)
Race Race
(Face Face Face the music)
Race Race
Race Race
(Face-F-Face the music)

// Dark //

I wanna top the rose petals that whisper sweet
Come on
So dark, dark, so dark
So dark, dark, so dark

Inside lookin' out my window
I don't see nothin' but rain
Sun up in the sky just a shinin' (just a shinin')
Still I'm lost in my shadow of pain

Like an innocent man that's on death row
I don't understand what made u go
And wanna leave me baby
Leave me in the dark

Can u tell me, tell me?

U took my sex and my money (money)
Took all my self esteem, yes u did
U had the nerve 2 think it was funny (funny)
I never knew a bitch so mean, yes sir

U absolutely drove a man 2 tears
All I really know is that u sincerely
U wanna hurt me baby, oh yes u do
U wanna hurt me in the dark

(Sunshine) Somebody make the sun shine
(Dark cloud) Somebody take this dark cloud away

Just as sure as Noah built the ark
That's how sure
That's how sure I am u broke my heart

How could u baby, leave me in the dark?
Baby, so dark
So dark, dark, so dark
Feel like the sun ain't never gonna shine
U left me in the dark
So dark, dark, so dark
I don't know, I don't know why we ever had 2 part
Baby, can't see a damn thing out my window it's so dark (so dark)
(So dark, dark, so dark)

Sometimes I want 2 curse the ground u walk on
Even when I know that everything u feel I feel it 2
I wanna curse u baby
U left me in the dark
And now I want 2, I wanna curse u baby
4 leavin' me alone, alone, alone
U left me in the dark, yes u did

And now all I wanna say is
In the dark
Ow, u left me
Ow, u left me
It's like being on death row (In the dark)
I don't understand why u had 2 go
I don't understand why u (hurt me in the dark)
Don't understand why u (hurt me in the dark)
Don't understand why u hurt me (hurt me, hurt me)
Hurt me (hurt me in, hurt me in)
Hurt me, hurt me, hurt me (hurt me in the dark)
Just leave me
In the dark

In the dark
So dark, dark, so dark (In the dark)
So dark, dark, so dark
In the dark

// Solo //

So low, the curb looks like a skyscraper
So high, the stars are under me
So quiet, I can hear the blood rushing through my veins
So low, I feel like I'm going insane
The angels, they watch in wonder
When U made love 2 me
Through the rain and the thunder
U cried in ecstacy

And U were so kind
I felt sorry 4 all creation
Because at the time, no 1 was lucky
no 1 was lucky, no 1 was lucky as me

And now U're gone and I just wanna be still
So silent, I'll just let my senses sleep

It's gonna be so hard 2 hear my voice
If I ever learn once more 2 speak

I'm so lost, no 1 can find me
And I've been looking 4 so long
But now I'm done
I'm so low, solo, my name is no-one

// Letitgo //

Ready or not, here I come
(Come on)
(Come on)
All my life I've kept my feelings deep inside
Never was a reason 2 let somebody know
Lover here, lover there - Who cried? Who cared? Foolish pride
Never was a good seat at any of this man's shows

Until now all I wanted 2 do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

But now I've got 2 letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let my feelings show
(letitgo)
I'm ready 4 the real
Give me something I can feel

All my life this heart's been under lock and key
My curtains were drawn there wasn't nobody home
Trigger here, Trigger there - everybody's high except 4 me
Better off dead if I couldn't be alone

Until now all I wanted 2 do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

But now I've got 2 letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let my feelings show
I, I'm ready 4 the real
Give me something I can feel

4teen years and tears I've longed 2 sing my song
But a horse couldn't drag your ass 2 put me on
But now I've got an army and we're three million strong
This song will ring in your ears when we are gone

Until now all I wanted 2 do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

But now I want 2 letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
Said I want 2 letitgo (letitgo)
Lay back and let the feelings show

I am ready 4 the real (Come a little closer)

(letitgo)
(Lay back an' let the vibe just flow)

// Orgasm //

Come on
Come on
Don't be shy, it's only U and I
Isn't that what U want?
Oh yeah

Oh here I come

Come on then

Keep going
Keep going
Oh yeah

Now
