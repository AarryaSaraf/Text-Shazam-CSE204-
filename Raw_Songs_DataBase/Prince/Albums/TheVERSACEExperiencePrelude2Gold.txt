// Pussy Control (Club Mix) (Edit) //

Welcome to the dawn, you've just accessed
The Versace Experience
(We'll be talking about)
Pussy pussy
(Control man)
(Here come the drums)

Uh, yeah, uh
Good morning ladies and gentlemen
Boys and motherfucking girls
This is your captain with no name speaking
And I'm here to rock your world
With a tale that will soon be classic
About a woman you already know
No prostitute she, but the mayor of your brain
Pussy Control

Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)

Our story begins in a schoolyard
A little girl skipping rope with her friends
A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
Just school books for the fight she would be in
One day over this hoodie
She got beat for some clothes and a rep
With her chin up, she scolded "All you all's molded
When I'm rich, on your neck I will step"
And step she did to the straight A's
Then college, a master degree
She hired the heifers that jumped her
And made everyone of them work for free?
No! Why?
So what if my sisters are trifling?
They just don't know
She said "Mama didn't tell'em what she told me
'Girl, you need Pussy Control'"

Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)

Verse 3
Pussy got bank in her pockets
Before she got dick in her drawers
If brother didn't have good and plenty of his own
In love Pussy never did fall
And this fool named Trick want to stick her
Uh, talking more shit than a bit
About how he going to make Pussy a star
If she come and sing a lick on his hit
Pussy said "Nigga, you crazy if you don't know
Every woman in the world ain't a freak (Pussy)
You can go platinum for times
Still couldn't make what I make in a week (Pussy)
So push up on somebody that want hear that
Cuz this somebody here don't want to know (Pussy)
Boy, you better act like you understand
When you roll with Pussy Control"

Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)

// Shhh (X-cerpt) //

(Uh)
The Versace Experience
(Mmm)
The Versace Experience
(Mmm, oh)
The Versace Experience
The Versace Experience

Shhh - break it down
I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow, they better not dare
Shhh - we gotta break it on down

In the daytime, ha, I think not!
I'd rather do you after school like some homework
Ah... am I getting you hot?
(Hot)
In my bedroom (No!) 'cause then we'd have to stop
(Please don't stop)
I'd rather wait until everyone's fast asleep
Then do it in the kitchen on the table top, oh!
We gotta break it on down (down, down, down)
Can you hear me girl?

Shhh - break it down
I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow, they better not dare
Shhh - we gotta break it on down

Are you listening, baby?
Ah hear me baby, hear me baby
(We gotta break it on down, down, down)
You making me want to ... oh!
Uh (Uh)
There it is
Uh (Uh)
Oh yeah
All night long
Are You diggin' this, baby? (Oh)
Down, down, down, down

(Shhh - break it down)
(Shhh - break it down)
(Shhh - break it down)
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Sex is not all I think about
It's just all I think about you

// Get Wild In The House //

Get wild!
Get wild!
Get wild!
Get wild!

When you're sick of that nine to five
And you're ready to come alive
And you looked both high and low
And you can't find a trumpet that blows

Come on baby, where the good times never die
Come on baby, where the damsels good and fly
Polyvinyl acetate will keep your monkey high
If you wanna get real freaky, now it's time to try, come on

Get wild!
Everybody up in the place
Get wild!
It don't matter what sex or race
Get wild!
All you nasty girls and boys
If you wanna get wild, say yeah
Make some noise!
Make some noise!

// Eye Hate U (Remix) //

Take of your clothes
Take of your clothes
Take of your clothes

I never thought that you would be the one
After all the things that we've been through
You gave your body to another in the name of fun
I hope you had some baby, if not, boo hoo

It's so sad but I hate you
Like a day without sunshine
It's so bad but I hate you
'Cause you're all that's ever on my mind
Honey, I hate you
Now everyday would be a waste of time
'Cause I hate you
I hate you

It's so sad that I hate you
I hate you
I hate you
'Cause I hate you
I hate you

It's so sad that I hate you
I hate you
I hate you
'Cause I hate you
I hate you

// 319 (X-cerpt) //

Take off your clothes
319
Bet you got a body, by God
Come on, let me see
You ought a
My camera's going to get you when you get it good and wet
You ought a let me come and pet you so it lasts, baby
319

Can I see it, baby?
(Mmm)
Ow!

I got a good shot, put your leg on the chair (Like that?)
You know you're too hot when you play with your hair (Ha ha ha)
I like it
I just want to holler, scream, and shout
When you let your fingers do the walking in and out and all about
319

Ah hoochie, don't do that
You... you... you make me want to dance!
Now watch this

Lock the door and kill the phone
My camera, you and me alone
Will make a picture all will see and go
"Ow, 319"

// Shy (X-cerpt) //

The Versace Experience

After a month of just being alone he said, "I wonder what L.A.'s thinking"
Streets he roamed in search of a poem amongst the wild and drinking
When he sees cool dark skin in hot virgin white
The search was over at least for tonight
When she co-signed and then told him she was...

Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Lips say won't but her body say might
Shy - Looks like we're going to take the long way home tonight
Ooh baby, don't you want to be alone tonight?
Shy - Yeah (Oh yes)
Shy (Shy)
Shy - Looks like we're going to take the long way home tonight
