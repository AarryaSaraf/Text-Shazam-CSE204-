// Around The World In A Day //

Open your heart, open your mind
A train is leaving all day
A wonderful trip through our time
And laughter is all U pay

Around the world in a day
Around the world in a day

Now dig
Loneliness already knows U
There ain't no reason 2 stay
Come here and take my hand, I'll show U
I think I know a better way, y'all

Around the world in a day
(listen 2 me, babe)
Around the world in a day
(all the babies sing it now)

Ooh-la-la
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la-la
No-sha-sha
No shouting
No shouting
No - no shouting

The little 1 will escort U
2 places within your mind
The former is red, white, and blue
The ladder is purple, come on and climb

Around the world in a day
Around the world in a day
Come on, sing
Around the world in a day
Say papa, I think I wanna dance

(summer she is sweet)

Around the world in a day
Around the world in a day
All the little babies, sing around the world
Around the world in a day

A government of love and music boundless in its unifying power
A nation of alms, the production, sharing ideas, a shower of flowers

// Paisley Park //

1, 2, 1, 2, 3

There is a park that is known
4 the face it attracts
Colorful people whose hair
On 1 side is swept back
The smile on their faces
It speaks of profound inner peace
Ask where they're going
They'll tell U nowhere
They've taken a lifetime lease
On Paisley Park

The girl on the seesaw is laughing
4 love is the color
This place imparts (Paisley Park)
Admission is easy, just say U
Believe and come 2 this
Place in your heart
Paisley Park is in your heart

There is a woman who sits
All alone by the pier
Her husband was naughty
And caused his wife so many tears
He died without knowing forgiveness
And now she is sad, so sad
Maybe she'll come 2 the park
And forgive him
And life won't be so bad
In Paisley Park

The girl on the seesaw is laughing
4 love is the color
This place imparts (Paisley Park)
Admission is easy, just say U
Believe and come 2 this
Place in your heart
Paisley Park is in your heart

See the man cry as the city
Condemns where he lives
Memories die but taxes
He'll still have 2 give
(who) Whoever said that elephants
Were stronger than mules?
Come 2 the park
And play with us
There aren't any rules
In Paisley Park

The girl on the seesaw is laughing
4 love is the color
This place imparts (Paisley Park)
Admission is easy, just say U
Believe and come 2 this
Place in your heart
Paisley Park is in your heart

The girl on the seesaw is laughing
4 love is the color
This place imparts (Paisley Park)
Admission is easy, just say U
Believe and come 2 this
Place in your heart
Paisley Park is in your heart

Your heart, your heart
Paisley Park
Your heart, your heart, your heart (sing, sing it)
Paisley Park
Paisley Park
Paisley Park

// Condition Of The Heart //

There was a girl in Paris
Whom he sent a letter 2
Hoping she would answer back
Now wasn't that a fool
Hardy notion on the part of a
Sometimes lonely musician
Acting out a whim is only good
4 a condition of the heart

There was a dame from London
Who insisted that he love her
Then left him 4 a real prince
From Arabia, now isn't that
A shame that sometimes money
Buys U everything and nothing
Love, it only seems 2 buy a
Terminal condition of the heart

Thinking about U driving me crazy
My friends all say it's just a phase, but ooh-ooh
Every day is a yellow day
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard

There was a woman from the ghetto
Who made funny faces just like
Clara Bow, how was I 2 know
That she would wear the same
Cologne as U and giggle the same
Giggle that U do?
Whenever I would act a fool, the fool
With a condition of the heart

Thinking about U driving me crazy
My friends all say it's just a phase, but ooh-ooh
Every single day is a yellow day
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard

There was a girl (There was a girl in Paris)
Whom he sent a letter to... (Whom he sent a letter 2)
(Hoping she would answer back)
She never answered back and now (wasn't that a foolhardy)
He's got a condition of the heart. (notion ...)

// Raspberry Beret //

1 2 1 2 3

Yeah

I was working part time in a five-and-dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely

Seems that I was busy doing something close to nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, Ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was
She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star

Listen
They say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya
If I had the chance to do it all again

I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

(Raspberry beret)
The kind you find (The kind you find)
The kind you find (In a second hand store)
Oh no no
(Raspberry beret)
(And if it was warm)
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (She wouldn't wear much more)
Yeah (Raspberry beret)

I think I... I think I... I think I love her

(Raspberry beret)
No No No
No No No (The kind you find)
(In a second hand store)
(Raspberry beret)
Tell me
Where have all the raspberry women gone? (And if it was warm she)
(Wouldn't wear much more)
(Raspberry beret)
I think I love.

// Tamborine //

Oh my God here U are
Prettiest thing in life I've ever seen
Close my eyes what's it like,
What's it like inside your tamborine?

Oh my God, there I go
Falling in love with the face in a magazine (uh oh, not again)
All alone by myself
Me and I play my tamborine

Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
Long days, lonely nights
Tamborine
Long days, lonely nights
Tamborine

I don't care 4 1 night stands
With trolley cars
That juggle 17
I just want 2 settle down and
Play around
My baby's tamborine

Tamborine what are U
Why are U the star of
All my dreams
(Star of all my dreams, are U a good tamborine)
Are U good, are U bad
Are U just unnecessary means

Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
Trolley cars

Long days, lonely nights
2 bad we're not allowed 2 scream (yeah, yeah, too bad)
Guess that I'll stay at home
All alone and play my tamborine (aww)

Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
Tamborine
The tamborine

// America //

Yeah
Peace!

Aristocrats on a mountain climb
Making money, losing time
Communism is just a word
But if the government turn over
It'll be the only word that's heard

America, America
God shed his grace on thee
America, America
Keep the children free

Little sister making minimum wage
Living in a 1-room jungle-monkey cage
Can't get over, she's almost dead
She may not be in the black
But she's happy she ain't in the red

America, America
God shed his grace on thee
America, America
Keep the children free

Freedom
Love
Joy
Peace

Jimmy Nothing never went 2 school
They made him pledge allegiance
He said it wasn't cool
Nothing made Jimmy proud
Now Jimmy lives on a mushroom cloud

America, America
God shed his grace on thee
America, America
Keep the children free

America, America
God shed his grace on thee
America, America
Keep the children free

Freedom
Love
Joy
Peace

Boom, boom, boom, boom
The bomb go
Boom, boom, boom, boom
The bomb go boom.
Teacher, why won't Jimmy pledge allegiance?

// Pop Life //

What's the matter with your life
Is the poverty bringing U down?
Is the mailman jerking U 'round?
Did he put your million dollar check
In someone else's box?

Tell me, what's the matter with your world
Was it a boy when U wanted a girl? (Boy when u wanted a girl)
Don't U know straight hair ain't got no curl (No curl)
Life it ain't real funky
Unless it's got that pop
Dig it

Pop life
Everybody needs a thrill
Pop life
We all got a space 2 fill
Pop life
Everybody can't be on top
But life it ain't real funky
Unless it's got that pop
Dig it

Tell me, what's that underneath your hair?
Is there anybody living there? (Anybody living there)
U can't get over, if U say U just don't care (Don't care)
Show me a boy who stays in school
And I'll show U a boy aware!
Dig it

Pop life
Everybody needs a thrill
Pop life
We all got a space 2 fill
Pop life
Everybody can't be on top
But life it ain't real funky
Unless it's got that pop
Dig it

What U putting in your nose?
Is that where all your money goes (Is that where your money goes)
The river of addiction flows
U think it's hot, but there won't be no water
When the fire blows
Dig it

Pop life
Everybody needs a thrill
Pop life
We all got a space 2 fill
Pop life
Everybody wants to be on top
But life it ain't real funky
Unless it's got that pop
Dig it

Pop life
Everybody needs a thrill
Pop life
We all got a space 2 fill
Pop life
Everybody can't be on top
But life it ain't real funky
Unless it's got that pop
Dig it

// The Ladder //

Once upon a time in the land of Sinaplenty
There lived a king who didn't deserve 2 be
He knew not where he came from
Nor where he was going
He never once said thank U, never please

Now this king he had a subject named Electra
Who loved him with a passion, uncontested
4 him each day she had a smile
But it didn't matter
The king was looking 4 the ladder

Everybody's looking 4 the ladder
Everybody wants salvation of the soul
The steps U take are no easy road
But the reward is great
4 those who want 2 go

A feeling of self-worth (everybody's looking)
Will caress U (for the answers)
The size of the whole wide world will decrease (how the story started)
(and how it will end)
The love of God's creation will undress U
And time spent alone my friend, will cease

Everybody's looking 4 the answers
How the story started and how it will end
What's the use in half a story, half a dream
U have 2 climb all of the steps in between (yeah, we ride)

Everybody's looking 4 the ladder
Everybody wants salvation of the soul
The steps U take are no easy road (the steps you take are no easy road)
(it's not that easy)
But the reward is great
4 those who want 2 go (I do)

Everybody... everybody's looking (Everybody's looking 4 the answers)
For the answers
Everybody wants to know how the story (How the story started)
Started and how it will end (started and how it will end)
What's the use in half a story, (What's the use in half a story)
Half a dream (half of a dream)
U, U gotta climb, U gotta climb (U have 2 climb all)
All of the steps in between (the steps in between)

Everybody,
Everybody's looking 4 that ladder (Everybody's looking 4 the ladder)
Everybody wants salvation of the soul (Everybody wants salvation of the soul)
(salvation)
The steps U take are no easy road (the steps you take are no easy road)
(that's for sure)
But the reward is great (the reward is great)
4 those who want 2 go, (4 those who want 2 go)
Those who want 2 go

Everybody... everybody wants (Everybody's looking 4 the answers)
An answer
Anyone who know how the story (How the story started)
Started, how it will end (started and how it will end)
Will it be lonely in the world (What's the use in half a story)
What's the use? (half of a dream)
(have 2 climb all)
(the steps in between)

// Temptation //

Sex
Temptation
Lust
Pop go mama

Everybody on this earth has got a vice
And mine, little darlin', mine is the opposite of ice
Mine is the running hot water of the daughter of morality
In other words, this little prince thinks a lot about U, see?
Baby, baby, baby
I'm guilty in the first degree

Temptation
Working my body with a hot flash of animal lust
Temptation
All my fingers in the pool go splash we must

Everybody in this room
Everybody in this room has got an urge
What's yours, baby?
Mine is temptation, it reigns at a party where lovers splurge
Pop go mama when daddy gets a little 2 much
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Purplelectricity whenever our bodies touch
Ooh baby, I love it when our bodies touch

Temptation
Working my body with a hot flash of animal lust
Temptation
All my fingers in the pool go splash we must

Temptation, temptation, temptation

Wait a minute now

Temptation
Working my body with a hot flash of animal lust
Temptation
All my fingers in the pool go splash we must

Temptation
Working my body, working my body, working my body

Temptation
I'm not talkin' about just ordinary temptation, people. I'm talking
About the kind of temptation that'll make U do things.
Oh, oh, temptation.
Oh, darling, I can almost taste the wetness between your...
Temptation, temptation
I'm not talking about any ol' kind of temptation, people, I'm talkin'
About, I'm talkin' about... sexual temptation.
A lover
I need a lover, a lover, I need a...right now.
U, I want U.
I want U in the worst way.
I want U.

"Oh, silly man, that's not how it works.
You have 2 want her 4 the right reasons."

I do!

"U don't, now die!"

No! No!

Let me go, let me go.

I'm sorry.
I'll be good.
This time I promise,
Love is more important than sex.
Now I understand.
I have 2 go now.
I don't know when I'll return.
Good-bye
