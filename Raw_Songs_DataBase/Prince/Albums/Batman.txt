Album: Batman

// The Future //

"I'm not gonna kill you. I want you to do me a favor,
I want you to tell all your friends about me."
"What are you?"
"I'm BATMAN!"

I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
And if there's life after, we will see
So I can't go like a jerk

Systematic overthrow of the underclass
Hollywood conjures images of the past
New world needs spiritually
That will last
I've seen the future and it will be

I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
And if there's life after, we will see
So I can't go like a jerk

Yellow Smiley offers me X
Like he's drinking seven up
I would rather drink 6 razor blades
Razor blades from a paper cup
He can't understand, I say 2 tough
It's just that I've seen the future
And boy it's rough

I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
And if there's life after, we will see
So U can't go like a jerk
No, no

I've seen the future and it will be
Wait a minute

Pretty pony standing on the avenue
Flashin' a loaded pistol, 2 dumb 2 be true
Somebody told him playin' cops and robbers was cool
Would our rap have been different if we only knew?

I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
If there's life after, we will see
Don't go out like a jerk

Systematic overthrow of the underclass
Hollywood conjures images of the past
New world needs spiritually
That will last
I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it will be

I've seen the future and it will be

I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it will be

"Think about the future"

// Electric Chair //

That's who I danced with
All the time I was watchin' U

The music rocked us
Our eyes locked-thus
Makin' us see a trippy picture shoo

If a man is considered guilty
4 what goes on in his mind
Then give me the electric chair
4 all my future crimes-OH!

U whispered something
It took my mind out like a
G flat major with an E in the bass
Your face looked so good
I wanted to touch your mouth
My brain is jackin' all over the place

If a man is considered guilty
4 what goes on in his mind
Then give me the electric chair
4 all my future crimes-OH!

Let's take a drive, love
So we can make up our minds, love
2 commit the crimes of passion
That sets us free
Me lovin' U, U lovin' me (me lovin' u, u lovin' me)

The electric chair

I saw your friend 1st
That's who I danced with
All the time I was watchin' u (I was watchin' u)
The music rocked us
Our lives shocked us
Makin' us see a trippy picture shoo
I've got to have it
Somebody...

If a man is considered guilty
4 what goes on in his mind
Then give me the electric chair
4 all my future crimes-OH!

U know I'm guilty, yeah, (4 all my future crimes)
Guilty, (4 all my future crimes)
And if ya don't really love me
(Then give me the electric chair) oh!

Electric chair

// Arms Of Orion //

'Orion's arms are wide enough'
'2 hold us both together'
'Although we're worlds apart'
'I'd cross the stars 4 U'

"In the heart of a sleepless moon"
"I'll be with U 4 ever"
"This is my destiny"
"'Till my life is through"

The arms of Orion that's where I wanna be
Since U've been gone
I've been searching 4 a lover
In the Sea of Tranquility
I'm drowning without U here, my dear

'When I am lost and feeling alone'
'I just look to heaven'
'I find my comfort there'
'God only knows where U are 2 night'

"God only knows where U are 2 night"
"Maybe time will tell me"
"'Till then I'll close my eyes and say a prayer 4 U"
('I'll say a prayer 4 U 2')

The arms of Orion that's where I wanna be
Since U've been gone
I've been searching 4 a lover
In the Sea of Tranquility
I'm drowning without U here, my dear

Orion's heart is bright enough
2 shine on both of us
The constellations never fail
2 light the way 4 love

'Orion's arms are wide enough'
2 hold us both together
"Although we're worlds apart"
('I'd cross the stars 4 U')
"I'd cross the stars 4 U"

The arms of Orion that's where I wanna be
Since U've been gone
I've been searching 4 a lover
In the Sea of Tranquility
I'm drowning without U here, my dear

The arms of Orion that's where I wanna be
"Since U've been gone I've been drowning" ('lost')
"In the sea of tranquility" ('lonely')
"Drowning without U here my dear" ('baby')

'The arms of Orion'
'That's where I wanna be'
'That's where I wanna be' ("the arms of Orion")
'That's where I wanna be' ("the arms of Orion")
'Since U've been gone, babe'
"Since U've been gone"
"I've been drowning", ('drowning'), "drowning"
Drowning without your love
"The arms of Orion" ('arms of Orion')

// Vicki Waiting //

"I'm of the mind to make some mookie.
phonebook..."

The phone rings, it's Vicki callin'
She wants me 2 come 2 the crib
She says conversation's better than being lonely
So I try my best to ad lib
I told the joke about the woman
Who asked her lover "Why is your organ so small?"
He replied "I didn't know I was playin' in a cathedral."
Vicki didn't laugh at all.

[Chorus:]
This is where she wants 2 be
I am what she wants 2 see
I never known a love so sweet
Still I keep Vicki waiting...
Alright

All is well in Gotham City
The sound of terror is all U hear
Sometimes a pistol takes the place of her body
Sometimes her body's here
But U see when crime is your only love
All that matter is the present, the here and now
People, people, whatever floats this joker's boat
Is whatever this joker will bang

[Chorus]

Oh yeah

Talk of children still frightens me
Is my character enough 2 be
One that deserves a copy made?
This I one day, hope 2 see
Until then she's held at bay
By my animal-like persistence
Or maybe she's just 2 proud 2 say
That fate (fate) brought us together
And this is where she wants 2 stay

[Chorus 2x]

All is well in Gotham town
This is where she wants 2 be
I am what she wants 2 see
I've never known a love so sweet
Still I keep Vicki
Still I keep Vicki
Still I keep Vicki waiting (waiting)
Aha aha

Still I keep Vicki
Still I keep Vicki waiting

This is where she wants 2 be

Just let yourself go - don't put up a fight
Sex - it's not that type of party
Girl, we're gettin' higher 2 night

Trust - who do ya?
