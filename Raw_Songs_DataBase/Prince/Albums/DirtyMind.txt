// Dirty Mind //

There's something about u, baby
It happens all the time
Whenever I'm around u, baby
I get a dirty mind
It doesn't matter where we are
It doesn't matter who's around
It doesn't matter
I just wanna lay ya down
In my daddy's car
It's you I really wanna drive
But you never go too far
I may not be your kind of man
I may not be your style
But honey all I wanna do
Is just love you for a little while

If you got the time
I'll give you some money
To buy a dirty mind
Don't misunderstand me
I never fool around
But honey you got me on my knees
Won't you please let me lay ya down (down, down, down...)

I really get a dirty mind (mind, mind, mind...)
Whenever you're around
It happens to me everytime (time, time, time...)

You just gotta let me lay ya
Gotta let me lay ya, lay ya
You just gotta let me lay ya
Gotta let me lay ya down

In my daddy's car
It's you I really wanna drive
Underneath the stars
I really get a dirty mind
Whenever you're around

I don't wanna hurt you, baby
I only want to lay you down

// When You Were Mine //

When you were mine
I gave you all of my money
Time after time
You done me wrong
It was just like a dream
You let all my friends come over and meet
And you were so strange
You didn't have the decency 
To change the sheets

Oh girl, when you were mine
I used to let you wear all my clothes
You were so fine (so fine)
Maybe that's the reason
That it hurt me so

I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (don't care)
Cuz I love u, baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did
When you were mine

When you were mine
You were kinda sorta my best friend
So I was blind (so blind)
I let you fool around
I never cared (didn't care)
I never was the kind to make a fuss
When he was there
Sleeping inbetween the two of us

I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (don't care)
Cuz I love you, baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did
When you were mine

When you were mine
U were all I ever wanted to do
Now I spend my time
Following him whenever he's with you

I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (don't care)
Cuz I love you, baby, that's no lie
I love you more that I did
When you were mine

When you were mine, yeah, oh no
Love you, baby
Love you, baby
When you were mine

// Do It All Night //

Pardon me, I wanna talk to you
I may be kinda shy But I just gotta tell you
What I'm going to do
Someone over there says He wants to get to know you
I don't care cuz
I really wanna hold you
And I'm so scared
[Girl], he might do something
To you that you like
Now I've been waiting
Such a bloody long time
Just to get this close to you
Now that you're near me
I want you to hear me
I'll tell you what I wanna do
Oh, I wanna do it
Do it all night
I wanna do it
Do it to you right
Giving up so easy
Is something that I never do
But I'm so easy, so easy
When it comes to loving you Can't you understand that I want
To hug and kiss you
I'll do anything I can just
To give you happiness
And I drown, baby, drown, baby
In your arms, c'mon baby
Can't you get to this?
I've been waiting such a bloody long time
And you're talking to someone else
Now that I've got your attention
There's something I wanna mention

I wanna do it
Do it all night
I wanna do it, oh yeah
Do it to you right
Do it all night
I,I wanna do it, oh yeah
Do it to you right

I wanna do it
Do it all night

Do it all night
Do it to you right

Do it all night
Do it to you right

// Gotta Broken Heart Again //

I've gotta broken heart again
Cuz we're only supposed to be friends
You see he stole my old lady away from me
And now I'm just as blue as I can be
I've gotta broken heart again
Cuz I ain't got no money to spend
You see I spend it all on long distance phone calls
Beggin her to please come home, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah
It doesn't matter what I do
I can't stop, ah, thinking about uou
The little things you said
The things you do to me in bed
Oh baby, I can't get you outta my head
Oh, oh, gotta broken heart again, yeah
This time it's serious
It feels just like the end
Cuz once your love has gone away
There ain't nothing, nothing left to say

// Uptown //

She saw me walking down the streets
Of your fine city
It kinda turned me on when she looked at me
And said, "C'mere"
Now I don't usually talk to strangers
But she looked so pretty
What can I lose,
If I, uh, just give her a little ear?
"What's up little girl?"
"I ain't got time to play."
Baby didn't say too much
She said, "Are you gay?"
Kinda took me by suprise
I didn't know what to do
I just looked her in her eyes
And I said, "No, are u?"
Said to myself, said
"She's just a crazy, crazy, crazy
Little mixed up dame.
She's just a victim of society
And all it's games."
Now where I come from
We don't let society
Tell us how it's supposed to be
Our clothes, our hair
We don't care
It's all about being there
Everybody's going Uptown
That's where I wanna be
Uptown
Set your mind free
Uptown
Got my body hot
Get down
I don't wanna stop, no
As soon as we got there
Good times were rolling
White, Black, Puerto Rican
Everybody just a-freakin'
Good times were rolling

She started dancing in the streets
Ow, girl, she's just gone mad
U know, she even made love to me
Ooh, best night I ever had
Ah yeah
I never talk to strangers
But this time it's all right
See, she got me hot, ah
I couldn't stop, ah
Good times were rolling all night All night, yeah
Now where I come from
We don't give a damn
We do whatever we please
It ain't about no downtown
Nowhere bound
Narrow-minded drag
It's all about being free
Everybody's going Uptown
It's where I wanna be
Uptown
U can set your mind free, yeah
Uptown
Keep your body hot
Get down
I don't wanna stop, no
Uptown
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Uptown
Everybody's going, everybody's going
Everybody gotta gotta
Uptown
Now go-go-go, go-go-go
They're going
Uptown

Uptown
Yeah, yeah, now, all now
Uptown
Gotta go-go-go
Uptown
Yeah, gotta go, gotta go
Uptown
C'mon, c'mon, you
U have to, you gotta go
Uptown

YEAH!

// Head //

I remember when I met u, baby
You were on you're way to be wed
You were such a sexy thing
I loved the way you walked The things you said
And I was so non-chalant
I didn't want you to be mis-led
But I've gotta have u, baby

// Sister //

I was only 16, but I guess that's no excuse
My sister was 32, lovely and loose

She don't wear no underwear
She said it only gets in her hair
And it's got a funny way of stoppin' the juice

My sister never made love to anyone else but me
She's the reason for my, uh, sexuality

Showed me where it's supposed to go
A blow job doesn't mean blow
Incest is everything it's said to be

Oh, sister
Don't put me on the street again
Oh, sister
I just want to be your friend

I was only 16 and only half a man
My sister didn't give a goddamn
She only wanted to turn me out

She took a whip to me until I shout
Oh, motherfucker's, sister, motherfucker
Can't you understand?

Oh, sister
Don't put me on the street again
Oh, sister
I just want to be your friend

I know what you want me to do
Put me on the street and make me blue
Oh, sister, ooh sister, ooh
