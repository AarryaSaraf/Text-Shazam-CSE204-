The Versace Experience

After a month of just being alone he said, "I wonder what L.A.'s thinking"
Streets he roamed in search of a poem amongst the wild and drinking
When he sees cool dark skin in hot virgin white
The search was over at least for tonight
When she co-signed and then told him she was...

Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Lips say won't but her body say might
Shy - Looks like we're going to take the long way home tonight
Ooh baby, don't you want to be alone tonight?
Shy - Yeah (Oh yes)
Shy (Shy)
Shy - Looks like we're going to take the long way home tonight
