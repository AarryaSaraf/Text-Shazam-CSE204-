Album: Happy

// Seattle //

Don't like the look of this old town
What goes up must come down
Character is lost and found
On unfamiliar playing ground

Get out of my world
What in the world

Shoeboxed around the rifle range
Have all your functions rearranged
Your mind and body gagged and bound
On a new familiar playing ground
The ordinary will ignore
Whatever they cannot explain
As if - nothing ever happened
And everything remained the same again

What in the world
What in the world
What in the world
Get out of my world
Get out of my world
Get out of my world
Get up, get out, get out of my world
Get up, get out, get out of my world
Get up, get out, get out of my world
Get up, get out, get out of my world
Get up, get out, get out of my world
Get up, get out, get out of my world
Get up, get out, get out of my world
Get up, get out, get out of my world
Open your mouth now

Secret signs and knowing looks
These sunny days will cook the books
Happy to take the misery
This mortal life can bring to me
Don't like the look of this town
What goes up must come down
Character is lost and found on unfamiliar playing ground

What in the world
What in the world
What in the world
What in, get out, get out, get out of my world
What in the world
Palaces, palaces, barricades, barricades, threats, threats, meet promises, meet promises...

// Rules And Regulations //

You'll wonder should you risk it
A pocket full of mischief
An idiotic rain dance
Relying on a romance

Another frame beginning
Now's the time for singing a-ha!
Prayer has conceded
Successfully succeeded

Rules and regulations
Rules and regulations

Howling at the moonshine
Barking up the wrong tree
A sacrificial slaughter
Took you from the altar

Rules and regulations
Rules and regulations

Have no fear of laughter
Wait for what comes after

Excusing no excuses
The hangman and his nooses
Busy executing
The bloody and blaspheming

Rules and regulations
Rules and regulations

The Spanish inquisition
No one above suspicion
Crying out for reason
Might as well be treason

Rules and regulations
Rules and regulations

Have no fear of laughter
Wait for what comes after

It's you they're looking out for
It's you they're coming after
Innocent not guilty
Not to this committee

// The Body //

When you run about
Without precautions
You'll get diseased 
And need abortions
And up till now
No vaccination
Can give you back your reputation

We want
We want your body
...

Cathy go home
Without your daughter
In a welfare state
She'll be well looked after
And it's easy now
This other person
Is off your back not a burden

We want
We want your body
...

// Save Me //

When it all began - born on desert sands
Desperate citizens - led by scorpions
Now the condition - religious discipline
Foraging fanatacism
Heaven this mouth of soap
God his private joke

So save me

This camel in the needles eye
Will laugh and let you die

Tear from limb to limb - take this pound of flesh
Searing choking dust - madness full of lust

Tear from limb to limb - take this pound of flesh

Save me - save me
Faith in foolish words - cows now join the herd
A mass of mindless ants - dead as decadence

Grind this golden crock - and bleat among the flock

Save me

Back - back to the country
Back to mother earth
Out near sellafield my nuclear birth
And save me
Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me

// Hard Times //

Dead dreams, dead dreams fly flags
Flapping in the breeze, wave your colored rags

Hard times, were they ever any better
Maybe never ever

The slogan will take you like lemmings to the cliff
You'll feel better than ever, and into the abyss

Ha! Ha! Ha ha
Hard times were they ever any better

Every crack every crevice will be sanitized
There'll be no more war there'll be no more choice

And those behind you - should go live elsewhere
Spies everywhere - you put the poison in the air

Hard times, were they ever any better
Maybe never ever

The words cry for help - but the music says, no
Every sentence a siege of national pride

Hard times, were they ever any better, maybe
And I - I won't answer the call
I don't like khaki, I won't wear your uniform
There'll be no more war, there'll be no more choice

There'll be no more war, there'll be no more choice

Hard times were they ever any better

// Open And Revolving //

Now this age of learning
Vocal vocabulary
But it still comes out sounding
Like some silly soliloquy

This attitude of winning
All the books you read
Pretty parrot fashion
But there's nothing in your head

You're winning

Better off removing
This educated stance
And the brilliant observing
When you're young and got the chance

You're winning

There are no easy answers
To elongated questions
So try and keep an eye out
And be open to suggestions

Be winning

And now you're understanding
Don't be vegatating
All the doors are open
Open and revolving
Heartaches and the headaches
Open and revolving

// Angry //

Your savage mind
Has made you deaf dumb blind
Your savage heart is tearing you apart

You, you make me angry
You, you make me angry

You're lost hiding in the crowd
Wearing numbers like a shroud
You are a coward we watch you conform

You, you make me angry
You, you make me angry

And what you're wearing
Is just another
Like any other uniform

You, you make me angry
You, you make me angry

You are fashionable
Like any other trend
You follow on, pose, pretend
You, you are not your own person
You, took a tactical diversion
Why, not try and be yourself
No individual, self made
Perfect creation

You, you make me angry
You, you make me angry

And all of the clones, that have impressed you
Have turned up and out and into a court jester
No excuse you are no use
You built your life on somebody else

// Fat Chance Hotel //

With the fly in my eye
It didn't take long
To realise
The desert sun
Might be good for some
Oh no, not for I

Fat Chance Hotel, Fat Chance Hotel

I get bored in the brain
Out here, doing nothing at all
Some useless holiday
This turned out to be
The dinner gave me
The splattery botty

Fat Chance Hotel, Fat Chance Hotel

Burning, all day long
I, I don't belong,
Itching in frustration
This, is not my ideal vacation

Fat Chance Hotel, Fat Chance Hotel
