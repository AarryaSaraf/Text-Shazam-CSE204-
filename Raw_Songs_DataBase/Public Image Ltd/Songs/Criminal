Like a criminal
Did you think it could be like on TV?
Where you could be big in your own movie?
Did real life let you down?
A genuine Pygmalion

(Criminal) Like a criminal
(No) No good to anyone
(Foolish) Gotta get a life and get sensible
(No) No pity, no pardon
Criminal. Just like a criminal
Could've been a factor
Could've been another distracter
Some like it in limousines, I like it in a tractor
Solo, separate, not just one of a crowd
Indifferent to compliment
I leave my funeral ground

(Criminal) Like a criminal

(No) No pity, no pardon
Just a criminal
Haven't got a clue
Cannot comprehend anything you value
I'm probably just like you
Yes, I haven't got a clue
Just let that Judas goat lead you down that narrowing
Path
As affluence is your influence
You'll be of no consequence

(Criminal) Like a criminal
(No) No pity, no pardon
Yes, I haven't got a clue
Just like a criminal
I can not comprehend anything you value
Probably just like you
Yes, I haven't got a clue
I cannot comprehend anything you value
