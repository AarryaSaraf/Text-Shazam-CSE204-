Better days will never be
Better days will never be
Better days will never be

Now what does this mean
It means we get the best scenes
When politics talk, the ends of power meet
Nice to be wanted, safe and protected
The ends of power, when politics talk

Better days will never be
Home sweet home, home, home

Now let's talk politics
Every dog has its day
For me (for me)
I don't believe (I don't believe in anything)
Better days ahead (one more war)
Will never be (I do believe no more)
I don't believe in (no long goodbye)
Anything (nuclear day)

Spare no man, match bomb for bomb
War, all is fair in war
When the ground is soft with hot blood
Spare no man

Better days will never be (match bomb for bomb)
A scorched earth (flatten the earth, this home sweet home)
No charity (burn everything, from lust to dust)
No weak pity (no charity, no weak pity)
From lust to dust (all is fair in war)
Home sweet home
