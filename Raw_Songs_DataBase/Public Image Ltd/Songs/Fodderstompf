Be bland
Be dull
Be boring
Be really, really, y'know, nothing, void, zilch, zero, nought, nothing, vacuum
Be in love
We wanted to be loved
We wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved

Ha ha ha
Oh no
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
Love
Oh love
Love
Love makes the world go round
We only wanted to finish the album with the minimum amount of effort which we are now doing very successfully
We only wanted to be loved
We only
Love
We wanted to be accepted by society
We wanted to be accepted
We wanted to be accepted as people
We wanted to be accepted as people
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
Love
Love
Love
We wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved

I'm just gonna go and get a cigarette, do you want one?
Yes please
Wont be a second
Okay

Be bland
Be dull
Be boring
Be in love

Only wanted to be loved
Only wanted to be loved
Only wanted to be loved
Only wanted to be loved
Love
Loved
Love

Every time I walk up and down the street
I look at people and I think why don't you love me
Why don't you love me
We only wanted to be loved...

Oh, thank you, wrong end

I'm in love
2, 3, 4
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We need love
We need love like the water we drink
Like the air we breathe, luvy
You know what I mean, like where I come from
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
Only wanted to be loved
Only wanted to be loved
Only love can satisfy us
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
No one understands us
Nobody cares
No one loves us
Love makes the world go round
Oh, it does that as well without any mistake whatsoever
Love does make the world go round
I don't know what these punk rockers get up to
Y'know these punk rockers with their spitting and their antics
Don't they realise that love makes the world go around
Don't these punk rockers realise realise that love makes the world go around
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
We only wanted to be loved
Fucking hell thirsty work in'it being famous
This track is dragging on
Do you think it'll ever end?
One more time?
What did you think of the engineer looking through that glass window?
I think he's rather suspicious
He looks very suspicious to me
Very dubious guy with that long haired hippy roadie next to him
I think these long haired chaps
I don't really think much of them, but don't you like their jokes?
They don't realise that
Love makes the world go 'round

We only wanted to be loved...

I will show our frustration at society by picking up that fire extinguisher over there and spraying it at the mic

We only wanted to be loved
It's true
Oh no
Oh yes!
We only wanted to be loved
Go on John tickle the old Joanna
We only wanted to be loved
Loved, loved, loved, loved
