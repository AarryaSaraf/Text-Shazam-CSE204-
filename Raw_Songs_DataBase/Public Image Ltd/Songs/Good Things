Little white lies - they hold little surprise

Good things come in threes
The places I haunt - the powers I taunt
And the little I need, I need

Where the arrogance of presidents - drive with the top down
And pop singers bite bullets and pops kiss the ground
The most favoured nations should be atheists
Not the penny pinch manipulators of the fundamentalists

Good things come in threes
The places I haunt - the powers I taunt
And the little I need

For everyone spotted - ten get missed
The deeper you look - the longer the list
And the CNN calling card - red herring day, "No news today"
Somebody somewhere indirectly directs them on their way
Stand up a token figure and twist whatever they say

Good things come in threes
The places I haunt - the powers I taunt
And the little I need
Good things come in threes
The places I haunt - the powers I taunt
And the little I need

Little white lies - they hold little surprise

Pin it on no one - it doesn't matter anyway
How many political despots worked for the USA
And who controls down South America way
And who controls the modern Russian way
Death in the streets, death is a project
All in the weak, the poor, the rich, the racist
And free thought should be looked upon as an enemy
Because free thought went to jail, long ago, what a pity

The spider's kiss, the White House astrologists
How many political despots worked for the CIA
The spider's kiss, the White House astrologists
Fuck, it's the CIA

Good things come in threes
The places I haunt - the powers I taunt
And the little I need
Good things come in threes
The places I haunt - the powers I taunt
And the little I need
...
