Everything in life should be free
Except the bits that belong to me
Sick to death of paying out money
What the hell has this place done for me? Nothing

Give, give, give me everything
Give
Give
Give
Give
Give
Give
Give
I want everything, give me everything
I want the lot

There's not much left of this country
Sell it off as a freehold property
And move into a new vicinity

One that does not have a history

If I ruled the world, there'd be no one in it
This place has come apart at the seam
The bulldog's had his day and so have we
We need to see some scenic scenery
No more of this boring misery

If I ruled the world, there'd be no one in it
