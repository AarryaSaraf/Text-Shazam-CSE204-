What you gonna do - when the river runs dry
Put your drills in the mud - death up in the sky
Should have saved those bottles
Should have saved those cans
Shouldn't oughta listen to the plastic man
No more toilet paper - it's gone just like the trees
Do you like the taste of honey - isn't it best without the bees
Be careful what you're doing - you're messing up my life
And if all this world's a cake - then you took too big a slice

What's it all about - they scream and then they shout
Don't ask me - 'cause I don't know (I don't know)
What's it all about - they scream and then they shout
Don't blame me - I told you so

Read it in the papers - you hear it in the news
Very few listen - a spew without a view
And is it really worth it - you're choking on remote
I see the red tide coming - but we don't even vote
Infection in the greenhouse - dizzy in the clouds
Oily as an ocean - heaven disemboweled
Planning on a future - well lucky for some
Develop your body - but your mind is still a slum

What's it all about - they scream and then they shout
Don't ask me - 'cause I don't know
What's it all about - they scream and then they shout (well don't ask me)
Don't blame me - I told you so (middle-age)

The product in the packaging
Of multi-layered glam
150 layers of materials
To cover up a sham
Protecting my planet
Wrap it in plastic
This package is product
Perfected eternal
A crap in a cling wrap
I never met yet a prime minister or president
Who told the truth yet

Swimming in the slurry
Burning in the heat
Wind blown is this weather
I eat what you secrete
I climb this highest derrick
This circus has no prayer
No UFO to save us
And do we really care

What's it all about - they scream and then they shout (do we really care)
Don't ask me - 'cause I don't know
What's it all about - they scream and then they shout
Don't blame me - I told you so

What's it all about - they scream and then they shout (no UFO to save us)
Don't ask me - 'cause I don't know
What's it all about - they scream and then they shout (no fun, no religion)
Don't blame me - I told you so

What's it all about - they scream and then they shout
Don't ask me - 'cause I don't know
What's it all about - they scream and then they shout (climb this highest derrick)
Don't blame me - I told you so

Kiss goodbye to the earth, the sun, the moon

It's easy to deceive a child
