Call me up after midnight
Tell me I'm wrong
Tell me I'm right
What do you want
What do I get
Did you just need the argument

Well, bad life

Corporate city
Lucky for some
Richest island in the sun
That's life

Name of the game
It's competition
Top of the pile
Not demolition

This is what you want
This is what you get

Bad
Bad
Bad
Bad life
Bad life

Now this machine is on the move
Now looking out for number one
The open road
I'm getting gasoline

Well, bad life
Bad
Bad
Bad life
Human gets dubious side

Well, that's life

Call me up after midnight
Tell me I'm wrong
Tell me I'm right
What do you want
What do I get
Did you just need the argument
Well, bad life

Bad life
Bad...
Bad life

Now looking out for number one
The open road
Getting gasoline
Human gets dubious side

Well, that's life
Bad life

Now looking out for number one
The open road
Getting gasoline
Human gets dubious side

Well, bad life
Bad
Bad
Bad life
Human gets dubious side

Well, that's life
Well, that's life

Well, that's life

This is what you want
This is what you get
...
