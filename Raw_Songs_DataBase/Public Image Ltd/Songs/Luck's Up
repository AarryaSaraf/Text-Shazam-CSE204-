When the blood in your drugs turns to shale
They had you hung, drawn and quartered tooth and nail
Empty pockets making idle hands
Mugging as a job requires good plans

Luck's up, tuff stuff
Luck's up, tuff luck
Luck's up, tuff stuff
Unlucky you

And where were you when the pickings were thicker than slime
A serious problem needs to be on time
Not good enough to crawl in the dark
You idiot, getting ripped off in the park

Luck's up, tuff stuff
Luck's up, tuff luck
Luck's up, tuff stuff
Unlucky you
Unlucky you

When the drugs that you were mixing blew up in your face
Blew your brains out, put a hole in its place
You wear your luck now all over your face
Still singeing like an old fire place

Luck's up, tuff stuff
Your luck's up, tuff luck

So yet again I hear you're gonna clean up your act
But once a junkie, always and that's a fact
You've begged, stole and borrowed time far too long
See you at your funeral, I'll sing your swan song

Luck's up, tuff stuff
Luck's up, tuff luck
Your luck's up, tuff stuff
Unlucky you
Well boo hoo

Un-fucking lucky you
Boo hoo
Got rid of the stupid rubbish
Un-fucking lucky you
Lucks up
