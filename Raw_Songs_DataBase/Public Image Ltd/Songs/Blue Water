Into the water

Splish, splosh
Bubbles
Swimming
Under the water
The blue water
Blue water

I'd give an arm
I'd give a leg
To be forever
Under the water
Blue water

Swimming
Under water
Blue water

I got my wish
I went splish
And I went splosh
And I got lost
Under the water
Blue water
I'd give a leg
To be forever
Blue water
Under the water
I'd give an arm
I'd give a leg
You chewed my guts
But not my head

Blue water
Blue water
Blue water

Blue water is feeding
Blue water

I'd give an arm
I'd give a leg
You chewed my guts
But left my head

Blue water
Blue water
Blue water

It's feeding
It's feeding
Water
Blue water
