Where can I stand in my uniform
Cannon fodder - six foot tall
Big and brave, next to my grave
Wait patiently for the death of me

Swings and roundabouts on unfairground
Ground in the ground on the merry-go-round

Blood and toil swim well in oil
And you and me the perfect foil
Unfield units to invest
Patriots do not protest

Swings and roundabouts on unfairground
Ground in the ground on the merry-go-round
Swings and roundabouts on unfairground
Ground in the ground on the merry-go-round

Weight of the world on your shoulders
A brass monkey on your back
As beautiful gardenia boulders or
Dead meat hung on a rock

Bigger the man, bigger the desk
Questioning your IQ test
Are you now so easily led
And lose the brains inside your head

Swings and roundabouts on unfairground
Ground in the ground on the merry-go-round
Swings and roundabouts on unfairground
Ground in the ground on the merry-go-round

The weight of the world on your shoulders...
Boulders on your boack - wait patiently
For the death of me
