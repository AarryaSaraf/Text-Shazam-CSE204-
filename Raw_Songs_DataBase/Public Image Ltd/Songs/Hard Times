Dead dreams, dead dreams fly flags
Flapping in the breeze, wave your colored rags

Hard times, were they ever any better
Maybe never ever

The slogan will take you like lemmings to the cliff
You'll feel better than ever, and into the abyss

Ha! Ha! Ha ha
Hard times were they ever any better

Every crack every crevice will be sanitized
There'll be no more war there'll be no more choice

And those behind you - should go live elsewhere
Spies everywhere - you put the poison in the air

Hard times, were they ever any better
Maybe never ever

The words cry for help - but the music says, no
Every sentence a siege of national pride

Hard times, were they ever any better, maybe
And I - I won't answer the call
I don't like khaki, I won't wear your uniform
There'll be no more war, there'll be no more choice

There'll be no more war, there'll be no more choice

Hard times were they ever any better
