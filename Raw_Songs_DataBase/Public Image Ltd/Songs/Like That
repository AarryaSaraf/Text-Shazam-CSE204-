Talk talk talk talk talk...

Like that, she did not like that
She did not like that-she never will
Like that, she did not like that
She did not like that-she never will
Just like a woman

Bad boy you should not do that
You penny pincher from rags to riches
And it's a pity so inexpertly
You mixed your roses with your cabbages

Like that. She does not like that
Like that. She did not like that
Just like a woman. And every man

In human nature these snakes and ladders
The fairground noises are messages
Life would be dull and boring
Without the choices of passages

Just like those dancing dervish
We spin in circles we strike up poses

Just like a woman, and every man
Combine those dreams and wishes
On standard clauses and marriages
