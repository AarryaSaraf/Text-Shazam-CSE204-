Well I'm not satisfied
Not in my head
Not scandalized not with what I said
I'm not compromised
I'm not satisfied
I'm not satisfied
I'm not much surprised
Not satisfied
Not satisfied
Not satisfied

I can't walk
And I can't talk
I'm with the pain
The suffering shame
Not satisfied
Why can't I
Remember your name
And got your name
And got your name
Not satisfied
Not in my head
This hospitalized bed
Might just be dead
Not satisfied
See I'm not satisfied
Not satisfied
Not satisfied
Not compromised
Not satisfied
With what I said
Not satisfied

And then the drugs to ease the pain
But the drugs did not work
And I'm back again
Don't you want me
Well don't you know me
That I can't have it
I need your pain
Again and again and again
This suffering shame
Not satisfied
Not satisfied
Not satisfied
Why can't I remember your name
And got your name
Why and got your name
Not satisfied
