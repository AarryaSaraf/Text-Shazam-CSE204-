What? You fucking nagging again?
About what? What? What?
The toilet's fucking broken again
I repaired that, I told you
Get the plumber in again
And again and again and again and again and again and again

Don't throw me to the Moon
And don't put me in a bubble
And don't come to me for a cuddle
'Cause all I want is the trouble, trouble, trouble

Give me a row, right now
We'll stir it up and clear the air
On what is what, it's only fair

I want the trouble trouble trouble
On the double double double
Give me trouble
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Don't want no pedestal
Don't want to be feeling small
Don't leave a stain on my name
Trouble is the end of the shame
