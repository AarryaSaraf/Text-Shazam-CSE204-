Your savage mind
Has made you deaf dumb blind
Your savage heart is tearing you apart

You, you make me angry
You, you make me angry

You're lost hiding in the crowd
Wearing numbers like a shroud
You are a coward we watch you conform

You, you make me angry
You, you make me angry

And what you're wearing
Is just another
Like any other uniform

You, you make me angry
You, you make me angry

You are fashionable
Like any other trend
You follow on, pose, pretend
You, you are not your own person
You, took a tactical diversion
Why, not try and be yourself
No individual, self made
Perfect creation

You, you make me angry
You, you make me angry

And all of the clones, that have impressed you
Have turned up and out and into a court jester
No excuse you are no use
You built your life on somebody else
