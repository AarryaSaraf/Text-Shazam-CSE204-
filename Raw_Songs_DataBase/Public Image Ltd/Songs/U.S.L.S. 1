U.S.L.S. 1...

The moon shines bright in the desert night
The other side of a clear sunlight
The other side of a character
Comes out to play before the day

U.S.L.S. 1...

The devil follows out his plans
And makes his work for idle hands
Neatly packaged bird has flown
The devil takes care of his own

U.S.L.S. 1...

Clouds now greeting this aeroplane
Tearing across the empty sky
A bomb implant in the luggage hold
The devil takes care of his own

U.S.L.S. 1...
