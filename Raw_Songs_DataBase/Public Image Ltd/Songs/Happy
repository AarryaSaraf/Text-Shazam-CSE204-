All those oh! so trendy in their flapper and flair
Delinquent derelict, four walls and a square
Never should you worry about society
The best things in this life are never free
Treat this whole world to a cavalry rout
And when you've had enough of go, go, go and get out

Is everybody happy? Well are you happy?

Get a live-in lover, never leave her alone
The lifestyle is impressive, and you've moved up a tone
Circulate in circles, leave the center at home
And happy is this hero, never needing a throne

We're having a party-and everyone's welcome
And if you've got no friends-I'm sure we'll invent some
It's things and then it's places
Not people and their faces
It's things and then it's places
Not people and their faces. And are you happy?

Don't go near the water till you learn how to swim
The parodies and prophecies, cataclysm
Probably a proverb, like blood from a stone
And happy is this hero, never needing a throne

It's things and then it's places
Not people and their faces
