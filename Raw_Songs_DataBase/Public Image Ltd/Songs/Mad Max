This is what you want
This is what you get

Bad life

Call me up after midnight
Tell me I'm wrong
Tell me I'm right
What do you want
What do I get
Did you just need the argument

Bad life

See this face
Better remember it
See this face
Gonna take all of it

Corporate city
Lucky for some
Richest island in the sun

Bad life
Bad bad bad life

Well this machine is on the move
Now looking out for number one (ha ha)
Bad life

Name of the game is competition
Top of the pile on demolition
This is what you want
This is what you get

Bad, bad, bad life
Bad life
Now looking out for number one
Now this machine is on the move

Bad life

Call me up after midnight
Tell me I'm wrong
Tell me I'm right
What do you want
What do I get
Did you just need the argument

Bad life
Corporate city
Lucky for some
Richest island in the sun
Bad life
Bad, bad, bad life

Well this machine is on the move
Now looking out for number one
Bad life
