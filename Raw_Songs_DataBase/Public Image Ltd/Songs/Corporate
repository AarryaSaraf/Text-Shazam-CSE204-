Our people killed
Our people have vision
No matter your color
You are family to me
Now put this all together
This is community
Even the other side of the planet
Is the other side of me
Are you here for me?
Well I'm here for you
And I am here for me

Get up off of the ground now
See fucking with you is fantastic now
Get up off of the ground now
Fucking me into a spastic now
Some of the times I can find you in the melodies
And some of the times I find you unwritten literally
But you are there and I hear you and I see
None of us is completely free
Well I am here for you
And I am here for me

Not global villages
But one globe
Not itty bitty little villages of pity and learning how to survive in the 21st century
And looking at world war 3
Because all humans seem to hate humanity

Oh, pity or suffer
Can we make the next century
This is your anthium
The lack of passion
Use some plenty one
Don't pay no for nothing
Are you the future
Corporate through wire
Don't know what you want to do
Why should I care for you
So young and dumb
Sack of potatoes
You're imitating now
The imitators now
You are the symphonies
You sell a kidneys
You are the world wide web
Welcome to the iCloud
End

This world you now live in
It is your own prison
It is the poison in your own soul
You made this all on your own
Mmh...
You murderer
Murderer
