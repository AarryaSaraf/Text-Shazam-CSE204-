Well, I've been dreaming, only dreaming
I've just been dreaming

Seems the dreams that I've been in
They are given meaning
In killing feelings and stealing reasons

I've been weak, disgusting thing
A good for nothing
Now I've been believing
Leaving again

Mean giving meaning, believe in dreams
Been stealing feeling
(Dreaming)
I've just been dreaming
(Only dreaming)

I've been in a dream, only dreaming
See imagining waking in a damaging hate
Mistaken meaning
Em, the dead cannot wait

Seen stealings? Feeling the same
Just been dreaming
Dreams can fill you in pain
Can fell a mountain

Cover you in shame
And you know you're to blame
Still feeling the same
Start dreaming again

(Dreaming)
See I've been dreaming
Well, I've been dreaming

(Only dreaming)
Feeling the pain again
(Dreaming)
Again and again, make believing

I've just been dreaming
I've just been dreaming
