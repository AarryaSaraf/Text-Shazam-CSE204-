Stained glass windows keep the cold outside while the hypocrites hide inside
With the lies of statues in their minds, where the Christian religion made them blind
Where they hide, a pray to the God of a bitch spelled backwards is dog
Not for one race, one creed, one world
But for money
Effective
Absurd

Do you pray to the Holy Ghost when you suck your host?
Do you read who's dead in the Irish Post?
Do you give away the cash you can't afford?
On bended knees and pray to lord?
Fat pig priest
Sanctimonious smiles
He takes the money, you take the lies
This is religion and Jesus Christ
This is religion, cheaply priced
This is bibles full of libel
This is sin in eternal hymn
This is what they've done
This is your religion
The apostles were eleven
Now there's a sod in Heaven

This is religion
There's a liar on the altar
The sermon never falter 
This is religion
Your religion
