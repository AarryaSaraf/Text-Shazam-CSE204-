You must have move to the beat
Of a different fella
Well whatever
Have to change in the weather
And as a mover, a docker, a diver when through
Yeah
You get what you deserve I hope
Cause life a lesson a waiting to be learned

You get to choose your life
You get the spice of choice
You get to lose your life
You get the grief and a voice

You get the heaven in your voice
You get to choose your life
You get the spice of choice
You get to lose your life
You get the heaven in your voice

Confess self obsession
You're a spender at a sperm
Extreme in exhibition
You are this family has a plan
Thanks to you I was part of these plans
Must have plan master by sand
Away we go
And all the better whatever
Away we go

You don't know ever been when you asking me about
What the fuck are you arguing about
So
Am I in or am I out
Am pushing in and you're pulling out
Well like it or not
Coming out of your mouth
Not too long you just shout about
You see the way we are
You're nearly there
You're nearly clever

And the way we go
And the way we are
And the way we go
And the way we are
And the way we go
And the way we are
And the way we go
And the way we are
