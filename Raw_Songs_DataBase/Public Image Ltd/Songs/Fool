Oh... you made a fool out of me
Treated me cooler, oh...
You made it tool, out of me

The e-mails she mails to you
Gossiped you dead, see it's anybody anywhere
Is good as they said
You made a fool, you made it tool, out of me

Pure passion as a matter of fact
Instinct as a physical act
I'll be nothing to you, you made a fool out of me
I am coming back, I know I don't fit in
I am missing to that
All that you do after, you go out
I give him, so I don't kiss this, baby
See you later, baby

You made a fool, out of me
You made it tool, out of me
Please, take me back
Make it, matter of fact
Instinct as a physical act
See, I've been nothing, ain't going back
And I don't fit it  tonight
I'm a tool, just a tool under your rule

Fools get crushed, oh
I can get used to that
Please take me back
Oh...
