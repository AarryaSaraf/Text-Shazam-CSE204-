It's that teenage feeling, got me staying in bed
There is nothing on my mind but water in my head
It's got me falling for just anyone, at least thinking I did
And it leaves me hanging on like some idiot kid

But I knew I had it coming
Well I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming

Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da dum

It's that teenage sickness keeping me up all night
It's got me climbing up the walls just to pick a good fight
I don't want to be so desperate, oh what have I done
Oh but I can't be alone, I'll take anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone

This was a test, this was a test
This was a test, this was a test
This was a test, this was a test yeah baby
This, this was a test yeah baby
This, this was a test yeah baby

Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da dum

I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming

Whoa this was a test, this was a test
This was a test, this was a test
This was a test
