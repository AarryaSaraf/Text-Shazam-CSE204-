I miss the drip in the back of my throat
Sometimes I miss my bloody nose
Two heads underwater, together we drowned
But nothing feels better when you're coming down
Nothing feels better when you're coming down

There's nothing that I won't believe
Waves are crashing over me
When a beautiful voice makes an awful sound
Well, nothing feels worse when you're coming down
Nothing feels worse when you're coming down

He said, "I need air, I need space"
One of us will die in this place
I see the fire through these clouds
I'll never have to feel it if I never come down
Never have to feel it if I never come down
Never have to feel it if I never come down

No mirrors on the table
No cab to the Chelsea Hotel
When it's freezing cold and I'm not able to tell

I see the rooftops disappear
How did I end up down here?
Am I falling asleep or blacking out?
Need you here if I ever come down
Need you here if I ever come down

It's the first time in months I've slept a whole night
You never once left my bedside
But don't you worry about me now
Just hold my hand and lay me down
Hold my hand and lay me down
Hold my hand and lay me down
Nothing feels better when you're coming down
