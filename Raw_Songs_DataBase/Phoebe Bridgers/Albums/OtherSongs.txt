// Coming Down //

I miss the drip in the back of my throat
Sometimes I miss my bloody nose
Two heads underwater, together we drowned
But nothing feels better when you're coming down
Nothing feels better when you're coming down

There's nothing that I won't believe
Waves are crashing over me
When a beautiful voice makes an awful sound
Well, nothing feels worse when you're coming down
Nothing feels worse when you're coming down

He said, "I need air, I need space"
One of us will die in this place
I see the fire through these clouds
I'll never have to feel it if I never come down
Never have to feel it if I never come down
Never have to feel it if I never come down

No mirrors on the table
No cab to the Chelsea Hotel
When it's freezing cold and I'm not able to tell

I see the rooftops disappear
How did I end up down here?
Am I falling asleep or blacking out?
Need you here if I ever come down
Need you here if I ever come down

It's the first time in months I've slept a whole night
You never once left my bedside
But don't you worry about me now
Just hold my hand and lay me down
Hold my hand and lay me down
Hold my hand and lay me down
Nothing feels better when you're coming down

// Day After Tomorrow //

I got your letter today
And I miss you all so much here
I can't wait to see you all
And I'm counting the days here

I still believe that there's gold
At the end of the world
And I'll come home to Illinois

On the day after tomorrow
It is so hard and it's cold here
And I'm tired of taking orders
And I miss old Rockford town
Up by the Wisconsin border

What I miss, you won't believe
Shovelling snow and raking leaves
And my plane will touch down
On the day after tomorrow

I close my eyes every night
And I dream that I can hold you

They fill us full of lies, everyone buys
'Bout what it means to be a soldier
I still don't know how I'm supposed to feel
'Bout all the blood that's been spilled
Will god on this throne
Get me back home
On the day after tomorrow

You can't deny, the other side
Don't want to die anymore then we do
What I'm trying to say is don't they pray
To the same god that we do?

And tell me how does god choose?
Whose prayers does he refuse?
Who turns the wheel?
Who throws the dice?
On the day after tomorrow

I am not fighting, for justice
I am not fighting, for freedom
I am fighting, for my life
And another day in the world here

I just do what I've been told
We're just the gravel on the road
And only the lucky ones come home
On the day after tomorrow

And the summer, it too will fade
And with it brings the winter's frost dear
And I know we too are made
Of all the things that we have lost here

I'll be 21 today
I been saving all my pay
And my plane will touch down
On the day after tomorrow
And my plane it will touch down
On the day after tomorrow

// Friday I'm In Love //

I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday, break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday, I'm in love

Saturday, wait
Sunday always comes too late
Friday, never hesitate

I don't care if Monday's black
Tuesday, Wednesday heart attack
Thursday never looking back
It's Friday, I'm in love

Monday you can hold your head
Tuesday, Wednesday stay in bed
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
It's Friday, I'm in love

Saturday, wait
Sunday always comes too late
Friday, never hesitate

Dressed up to the eyes
It's such a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throwing out your frown
Smiling at the sound
And as sleek as a shriek
Spinning round and round
Always take a big bite
It's such a gorgeous sight
To see you eat in the middle of the night
You can never get enough
Enough of this stuff
It's Friday I'm in love

I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday, I'm in love
Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday, I'm in love

// Georgia Lee //

Cold was the night and hard was the ground
They found her in a small grove of trees
Lonesome was the place where Georgia was found
She's too young to be out on the street

Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?

I'da said she couldn't keep Georgia from dropping out of school
I was doing the best that I could
But she just kept running away from this world
These children are so hard to raise good

Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?

Close your eyes and count to ten
And I will go and hide but then
Be sure to find me, I want you to find me
And we'll play all over
We'll play all over
We'll play all over again

There's a toad in the witch grass, there's a crow in the corn
Wild flowers all across by the road
And somewhere a baby is crying for her mom
As the hills turn from green back to gold

Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?

Why wasn't God watching?
Why wasn't God listening?
Why wasn't God there for Georgia Lee?

// Goodbye To Love //

I'll say goodbye to love
No one ever cared if I should live or die
Time and time again the chance for love has passed me by
And all I know of love is how to live without it
I just can't seem to find it
So I've made my mind up
I must live my life alone
And though it's not the easy way
I guess I've always known

I'd say goodbye to love
There are no tomorrows for this heart of mine
Surely time will lose these bitter memories
And I'll find that there is someone to believe in
And to live for, something I could live for

All the years of useless search
Have finally reached an end
Loneliness and empty days
Will be my only friend
From this day love is forgotten
I'll go on as best I can

What lies in the future is a mystery to us all
No one can predict the wheel of fortune as it falls
There may come a time when I will see that I've been wrong
But for now this is my song
And it's goodbye to love
I'll say goodbye to love

// Killer + The Sound //

Sometimes I think I'm a killer
Scared you in your house
Even scared myself by talking
About Dahmer on your couch

But I can't sleep next to a body
Even harmless in death
Plus I'm pretty sure I'd miss you
Faking sleep to count your breath

Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
Is there nothing left to do for us?
I am sick of the chase
But I'm hungry for blood
And there's nothing I can do

But when I'm sick and tired
When my mind is barely there
When a machine keeps me alive
And I'm losing all my hair

I hope you kiss my rotten head
And pull the plug
Know that I've burned every playlist
And given all my love

Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
I know there's something waiting for us
I am sick of the chase
But I'm stupid in love
And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can do

Nothing ever comes like it did when you were in it
Just a memory of a kid, just a washed out finish
Just a pain-in-the-ass Johnny Cash middle finger
No shooting up drugs, no quitter is a winner

Nothing ever comes like it did when you were in it
Keeping nothing for yourself like a stone cold killer
Now you're passing your people like a ship in the night
Looking to every stranger for a fight

Nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
Choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
Open up your mouth, your mouth if you want it
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down

Hoping that you like, that you like how you're living
Relying on the kindness of strangers that you will be forgiven
How many times, how many times will you shit on what you're given?
How many times, how many times 'til you shut up and listen?

Nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
Choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
Open up your mouth, your mouth if you want it
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down

Nothing ever comes, ever comes
Choking like a dog, like a dog
Open up your mouth
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down

Nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
Choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
Open up your mouth if you want it
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down

// Nothing Else Matters //

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
Now, nothing else matters

// Prayer In Open D //

There's a valley of sorrow in my soul
Where every night I hear the thunder roll
Like the sound of a distant gun
Over all the damage I have done

And the shadows filling up this land
Are the ones I built with my own hand
There is no comfort from the cold
Of this valley of sorrow in my soul

There's a river of darkness in my blood
And through every vein I feel the flood
I can find no bridge for me to cross
No way to bring back what is lost

Into the night it soon will sweep
Down where all my grievances I keep
But it won't wash away the years
Or one single hard and bitter tear

And the rock of ages I have known
Is a weariness down in the bone
I used to ride it like a rolling stone
Now I just carry it alone

There's a highway rising from my dreams
Deep in the heart I know it gleams
For I have seen it stretching wide
Clear across to the other side

Beyond the river and the flood
And the valley where for so long I've stood
With the rock of ages in my bones
Someday I know it will lead me home

// Sidelines //

I'm not afraid of anything at all
Not dying in a fire, not being broke again
I'm not afraid of living on a fault line
'Cause nothing ever shakes me, nothing makes me cry

Not a plane going down
In the ocean and drowning

Watched the world from the sidelines
Had nothing to prove
Till you came into my life
Gave me something to lose
Now I know what it feels like
To want to go outside
Like the shape of my outline

I'm not afraid of going back to school
I gave it up the first time, but I'll try again
I'm not afraid of getting older
Used to fetishize myself
Now I'm talking to my house plants

Not of being alone
In a room full of people

Watching the world from the sidelines
Had nothing to prove
Till you came into my life
Gave me something to lose
Now I know what it feels like
To want to go outside
Like the shape of my outline

And I used to think
You could hear the ocean in a seashell
What a childish thing

// So Much Wine //

I had nothing to say on Christmas Day
When you threw all your clothes in the snow
When you burnt your hair and knocked over chairs
I just tried to stay out of your way

But when you fell asleep
With blood on your teeth
I just got in my car and drove away

Listen to me, Butterfly
There's only so much wine
That you can drink in one life
And it will never be enough
To save you from the bottom of your glass

Where the state highway starts, I parked my car
And I got out and stared up at the stars
And as meteors dived and shot across the sky
I thought about your sad, shining eyes

I came back for my clothes
When the sun finally rose
When you were still passed out on the floor

Listen to me, Butterfly
There's only so much wine
That you can drink in one life
And it will never be enough
To save you from the bottom of your glass

// Steamroller //

I am tired of being sad
I feel it when I wake up
And it just stays bad
It hits me like a sickness
Or a steamroller
Makes me wanna lay down
And get run over

But then I see you
Always smiling
Makes me wanna touch you
Keep from dying

You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
You're the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine

Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me to

We talk for hours
Until finally
Sleep takes over
The amphetamines

In the darkness
I feel your fingers
They don't touch me
But there's a danger

You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
Your the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine

Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me

You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
You're the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine

Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me

// Summer's End //

Summer's end's around the bend just flying
The swimming suits are on the line just drying
I'll meet you there per our conversation
I hope I didn't ruin your whole vacation

You never know how far from home you're feeling
Until you watch the shadows cross the ceiling
Well I don't know but I can see it snowing
In your car the windows are wide open

Come on home
Come on home
You don't have to be alone
Just come on home

Valentines breaks hearts and minds at random
That ol' Easter egg ain't got a leg to stand on
Well I can see that you can't win for trying
And New Year's Eve is bound to leave you crying

Come on home
Come on home
You don't have to be alone
Just come on home

The moon and stars hang out in bars just talking
I still love that picture of us walking
Just like that old house we thought was haunted
Summer's end came faster than we wanted

Come on home
Come on home
No you don't have to be alone
Just come on home
Come on home
No you don't have to be alone
Come on home

// That Funny Feeling //

Stunning 8K resolution meditation app
In honor of the revolution, it's half-off at the Gap
Deadpool's self-awareness, loving parents, harmless fun
The backlash to the backlash to the thing that's just begun

There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling
There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling

The surgeon general's pop-up shop, Robert Iger's face
Discount Etsy agitprop, Bugles' take on race
Female Colonel Sanders, easy answers, civil war
The whole world at your fingertips, the ocean at your door
The live-action Lion King, the Pepsi Halftime Show
Twenty-thousand years of this, seven more to go
Carpool Karaoke, Steve Aoki, Logan Paul
A gift shop at the gun range, a mass shooting at the mall

There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling
There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling

Reading Pornhub's terms of service, going for a drive
And obeying all the traffic laws in Grand Theft Auto V
Full agoraphobic, losing focus, cover blown
A book on getting better hand-delivered by a drone
Total disassociation, fully out your mind
Googling "derealization," hating what you find
That unapparent summer air in early fall
The quiet comprehending of the ending of it all

There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling
There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling

Hey, what can you say?
We were overdue
But it'll be over soon
You wait
Hey, what can you say?
We were overdue
But it'll be over soon
Just wait
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da-da
Hey, what can you say?
We were overdue
But it'll be over soon
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da-da

// Turned Around //

I'm not crazy
I'm just nervous
I'm on my toes
At the edge of the world
And my mind feels like an empty room
The inside black as coal
And it hurts to want something so bad
That you lose all self control

And I know
How you are sometimes
And I know
You're just a little turned around

Yeah, I can feel it getting late
And my body is getting tired
But there's no point leaving before they game
When my mind feels so wired
Yeah, you took me to this station and you showed me every sign
No one else could understand
You know I'm lost but I'll be fine

And you know
How I am sometimes
And you know
I'm just a little turned around

We had it all planned out
It's so hard to watch it burn
Burn...
Watch it burn

Watch it burn

// Waiting Room //

If you were a teacher, I would fail your class
Take it over and over til you noticed me
If you were a waiting room, I would never see a doctor
I would sit there with my first aid kit and bleed

I want to be the power ballad that lifts you up and hold you down
I wanna be the broken love song that feeds your misery
And I can wish all I want, but it won't bring us together
Plus I know whatever happens to me
I know it's for the better

When broken bodies are washed ashore
Who am I to ask for more, more, more?
But you're breathing in my open mouth
You're the gun in my lips that will blow my brains out

I want to make you drive all night just because I said maybe you should come over
I want to make you fall in love as hard as my poor parents teenage daughter
She'll be the best you ever had if you let her

I know it's for the better...

// Walking On A String //

The things you said are hanging in the middle of my mind tonight
I can't turn 'em off
I try to worry for your soul but I forget to
All the time
I'm in a twisted web and I can't pull my
Head from it

I think about you walking on a string
It always bring me back here
Into the garden by the hand
You've always had me
Walking on a string

I knew that I was dead before you touched my lonesome skin
You're never running out of ways to worm your way back in
I hang my head and feel the oxygen drain
I think about you walking on a string and it always brings me back here

Into the garden by the hand
Anyone who knows what love is will understand
You've always had me
Walking on a string

In a web, I can't escape it
You'll always worm your way back in
To my lonesome soul and take it
You've always had me walking on a string

In a web, I can't escape it
You'll always worm your way back in
To my lonesome soul and take it
You've always had me walking on a string

// Whatever //

It's that teenage feeling, got me staying in bed
There is nothing on my mind but water in my head
It's got me falling for just anyone, at least thinking I did
And it leaves me hanging on like some idiot kid

But I knew I had it coming
Well I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming

Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da dum

It's that teenage sickness keeping me up all night
It's got me climbing up the walls just to pick a good fight
I don't want to be so desperate, oh what have I done
Oh but I can't be alone, I'll take anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone

This was a test, this was a test
This was a test, this was a test
This was a test, this was a test yeah baby
This, this was a test yeah baby
This, this was a test yeah baby

Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da dum

I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming

Whoa this was a test, this was a test
This was a test, this was a test
This was a test

// Wilt //

I've got a surgeon's precision and a drunk man's hand
They say I've stopped growin', so I do what I can
Nothin' ever changes but the cigarette brand
But don't panic, it's just routine
Don't panic, this is just routine

You've got roses on the brain, and I'm all wilt
You've got snowflakes in your veins, and I'm all melt
You don't got blame on your breath
God bless, but all I taste is guilt
Ooh

Misery will bury you
I'm so sorry if I'm scarin' you
What was I supposed to do
As opposed to lovin' you?

I've got a surgeon's hand and a drunk man's passion
Totally limbless and I'm ready for action
Nothin' ever changes but the taste of tobacco
But don't panic, it's just routine
Don't panic, this is just routine

You've got roses on the brain, and I'm all wilt
You've got snowflakes in your veins, and I'm all melt
You don't got blame on your breath
God bless, but all I taste is guilt
Ooh

Misery will bury you
I'm so sorry if I'm scarin' you
What was I supposed to do
As opposed to lovin' you?

You've got roses the brain, and I'm all wilt

But misery will bury you
I'm so sorry if I'm scarin' you
What was I supposed to do
As opposed to lovin' you?
