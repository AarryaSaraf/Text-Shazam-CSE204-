// Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most //

Once I was a sentimental thing,
Threw my heart away each Spring;
Now a Spring romance hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to Winter;
All I've got to show's a splinter for my little fling!

Spring this year has got me feeling like a horse that never left the post;
I lie in my room staring up at the ceiling,
Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most!

Morning's kiss wakes TREES and flowers,
And to them I'd like to drink a toast;
I walk in the park just to kill lonely hours,
Spring Can really Hang You Up The Most.

All afternoon those birds twitter twit,
I know the tune, "This is love, this is it!"
Heard it before and I know the score,
And I've decided that Spring is a bore!

Love seemed sure around the New Year,
Now it's April, love is just a ghost;
Spring arrived on time, only what became of you, dear?
Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most!
Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most!

Spring is here, there's no mistaking
Robins building nests from coast to coast;
My heart tries to sing so they won't hear it breaking,
Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most!

College boys are writing sonnets,
In the "Tender passion" they're engrossed;
But I'm on the shelf with last YEAR's Easter bonnets,
Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most!

Love came my way, I hope it would last;
We had our day, now that's all in the past!
Spring came along a season of SUN,
Full of sweet promise but SOMETHING wrong!

Doctors once prescribed a tonic,
"Sulphur and MOLASSES" was the dose;
Didn't help a bit, my condition must be chronic,
Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most!

All alone, the party's over,
Old man Winter was a gracious host;
But when you keep praying for snow to hide the clover
Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most!

// Whisper Not //

Sing low, sing clear
Sweet words in my ear
Not a whisper of despair
But love's own prayer
Sing on, until
You bring back the thrill
Of a sentimental tune
That died too soon
Our harmony was lost
But you forgave, I forgot
Whisper not of quarrels past
You know we've had our last

So now, we'll be
On key constantly
Love will whisper on eternally

Not a whisper of despair
But sweet tender love's own prayer
Own prayer
Of a sentimental tune that died long ago
Too soon, too soon
Why did we listen when they said it wouldn't last
Gossiping voices made us break up
But you know we still can make up
If we forget them all
And answer Cupid's call
Whispers of troubles are an echo of the past
All it will take to lose my gloom
Is just a whisper not of rumors
But of your love for me
And that's how it's got to be

So now, we'll be
On key constantly
Love will whisper on eternally
Sing low, sing clear
Sweet words in my ear
Love will whisper on eternally

// I Said No //

There he stood in my doorway so boldly
And he whispered of pleasures I'd missed
Though at first I refused very coldly
How long can a lady resist?
How long can a lady resist?

I said "No", he said "Please"
I said "No", he said "Please"
I said "No", he said "Please, pretty baby"
I said "No", he said "Why?"
I said "No", he said "Why?"
I said "No", he said "Try"
I said "Maybe"
He said "Now?"
I said "Well"
He said "Ah, this is swell
And you'll never know how much it will mean"
So at last, I confess
I said "Yes, yes yes yes"
That's how I subscribed
To Liberty Magazine

Now I subscribed
To the magazine
And fell in love with a guy
But he didn't dig me
He had no eyes
And now I've really got to try

He said "No", I said "Please"
He said "No", I said "Please"
He said "No", I said "Please, come on baby"
He said "No", I said "Why?"
He said "No", I said "Why?"
He said "No", I said "Try"
He said "Oh, well maybe"
I said "Now?"
He said "Well"
Ah, he said "Ah, this is swell"
And the moonlight in his eyes was sublime
So at last, I confess
Ah, he said "Yes, yes yes yes"
That's how I subscribed
To Esquire
And uh, the Rouge and the Stag
And the Cavalier
And the Field and Stream
Now let me see, oh yes, I forgot
That's how I subscribed
To Playboy Magazine

// Time After Time //

Time after time, you'll hear me say
That I'm so lucky to be loving you

Time after time, I tell myself
That I'm so lucky to be loving you
So lucky to be the one you run to see
In the evening when the day is through

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new

And time after time, you'll hear me say
That I'm so lucky to be loving you

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new

And time after time, you'll hear me say
That I'm so lucky to be loving you

Time after time you'll hear me say
That I'm so lucky to be loving you
Just you, just you

// You've Changed //

I've an awfully funny feeling
That this thought that's been a-stealin'
Through my brain is not to be ignored
But to really tell the truth
Though I'm not a well-known sleuth
I honestly believe that you are bored

You've changed
That sparkle in your eyes is gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart
You've changed

You've changed
Your kisses now are so blas√©
You're bored with me in every way
I can't understand
You've changed

You've forgotten the words 'I love you'
Each memory that we've shared
You ignore every star above you
I can't realize you ever cared

You've changed
You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me that that we're through
It's all over now
You've changed

You've changed
You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me that we're through
It's all over now
Yes, it's all over now
You've changed

// I've Got Your Number //

I've got your number
I know you inside out
You ain't no Eagle Scout
You're all at sea

Oh yes, you brag a lot
Wave your own flag a lot
But you're unsure a lot
You're a lot like me, oh

I've got your number
And what you're looking for
And what you're looking for
Just suits me fine

We'll break the rules a lot
We'll be damn fools a lot
But then why should we not
How could we not combine when

I've got your number
And I've got the glow you've got
I've got your number
And more

So go ahead and pick a number
From one to ten
You're losing streak is over
I can't win again
And here's the punchline
You've got mine

// Lover Man (Oh Where Can You Be?) //

I don't know why, but I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something I never had
Never had no kissin'
Oh, what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

The night is cold and I'm so all alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me

Strange as it seems
Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet
Little things in my ears

Hugging and kissing
Oh, what we've been missing
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me

Strange as it seems
Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet
Little things in my ears

Hugging and kissing
Oh, what we've been missing
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

// Wives And Lovers //

Hey, little girl, comb your hair, fix your makeup
Soon he will open the door
Don't think because there's a ring on your finger
You needn't try any more

For wives should always be lovers too
Run to his arms the moment that he comes home to you
I'm warning you

Day after day, there are girls at the office
And the men will always be men
Don't stand him up, with your hair still in curlers
You may not see him again

Wives should always be lovers too
Run to his arms the moment he comes home to you
He's almost here, hey, little girl, better wear something pretty
Something you wear to go to the city

Dim all the lights, pour the wine
Start the music, time to get ready for love
Time to get ready for love, yes it's time to get ready for love
It's time to get ready, kick your shoes off, baby

// Matchmaker, Matchmaker //

Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match
Find me a find, catch me a catch
Matchmaker, matchmaker, look through your book
And make me a perfect match

Matchmaker, matchmaker, I'll bring the veil
You bring the groom, slender and pale
Bring me a ring, for I'm longing to be
The envy of all I see

For Papa, make him a scholar
For Mama, make him rich as a king
For me, well, I wouldn't holler
If he were as handsome as anything

Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match
Find me a find, catch me a catch
Night after night, in the dark, I'm alone
So, find me a find, make me match of my own

For Papa, make him a scholar
For Mama, make him rich as a king
For me, well, I wouldn't holler
If he were as handsome as anything

Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match
Find me a find, catch me a catch
Night after night, in the dark, I'm alone
So, find me a find, make me match of my own

Matchmaker, matchmaker, catch me a catch
Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match
Find me a find, catch me a catch
Matchmaker, matchmaker, find me a find, catch me a catch
Find me a find, make me a match
