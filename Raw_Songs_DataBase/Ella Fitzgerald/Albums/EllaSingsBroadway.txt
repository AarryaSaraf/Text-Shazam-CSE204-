// If I Were A Bell //

Ask me how do I feel
Ask me now that we're cosy and clingin'
Well, sir, all I can say
Is if I were a bell, I'd be ringin'
From the moment we kissed tonight
That's the way I've just gotta behave
Boy, if I were a lamp, I'd light
Or if I were a banner, I'd wave

Ask me how do I feel
Little me with my quiet upbringing
Well, sir, all I can say
Is if I were a gate, I'd be swinging
And if I were a watch
I'd start popping my springs
Or if I were a bell
I'd go ding dong, ding dong ding

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning
Well sir, all I can say
Is if I were a bridge I'd be burning
Yes, I knew my morale would crack
From the wonderful way that you looked
Boy, if I were a duck, I'd quack
Or if I were a goose, I'd be cooked

Ask me how do I feel
Ask me now that we're fondly caressing
Pal, if I were a salad
I know I'd be splashing my dressing
Or if I were a season
I'd surely be spring
Or if I were a bell
I'd go ding dong, ding dong ding

// Hernando's Hideaway //

I know a dark, secluded place
A place where no one knows your face!
A glass of wine, a fast embrace
It's called Hernando's Hideaway, a-way!

All you see are silhouettes
And all you hear are castanets
And no one cares how late it gets
Not at Hernando's hideaway, a-way!

At the Golden Finger Bowl or anyplace you go
You will meet your Uncle Max and everyone you know
But if you go to the spot that I am thinking of
You will be free to gaze at me and talk of love
Just knock three times and whisper low
That you and I were sent by Joe
Then strike and match and you will know
You're in Hernando's hideaway, a-way!

I know a dark, secluded place
A place where no one ever knows your face!
Wine is fine with a fast embrace
Hernando's Hideaway -away!

At the Golden Finger Bowl or anyplace you go
You will meet your Uncle Max and everyone you know
But if you go to the spot that I am thinking of
You will be free to gaze at me and talk of love
Just knock three times and whisper low
That you and I were sent by Joe
Then strike and match and you will know
You're in Hernando's hideaway!

// Warm All Over //

It makes me feel warm all over
Warm all over
Every time you smile you get me warm all over

Sometimes I feel kind of out in the cold
But then I touch your hand
And I'm home, home again
And warm all over
Warm all over

Gone are all the clouds that used to swarm all over
Please always let me keep feeling the way I do
So warm, warm all over
With a tender love for you

You touch my hand and I'm warm all over
Warm all over
Gone are all the clouds that used to swarm all over
Please always let me keep feeling the way I do
So warm all over
With a tender love for you

Warm, tender love, tender love for you

// Almost Like Being In Love //

What a day this has been
What a rare mood I'm in
Why it's almost like being in love
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love

All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When that bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love

What a day this has been
What a rare mood I'm in
Why it's almost like being in love
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love

All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When that bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love

// Dites-Moi //

Dites-moi
Pourquoi
La vie est belle
Dies-moi
Pourquoi
La vie est gai
Dites-moi
Pourquoi
Chere Mad'moiselle
Est-ce que
Parce que
Vous m'aimez?

Dites-moi
Pourquoi
Chere Mad'moiselle
Est-ce que
Parce que
Vous m'aimez?

Tell me why
The sky is filled with music
Tell me why
We fly on clouds above
Can it be
That we
Can fly to music
Just because
Just because
We're in love?

// I Could Have Danced All Night //

I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night
And still have begged for more
I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things
I've never done before

I'll never know what made it so exciting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when he began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced all night

I could have danced all night, I could have danced all night
And still have begged for more, more, more
I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things
I've never done before

I'll never know what made it so, so exciting
Why all at once my heart took flight
I only know when he began to dance with me
I could have danced, danced, danced all night

// No Other Love //

No other love have I
Only my love for you
Only the dream we knew
No other love

Watching the night go by
Wishing that you could be
Watching the night with me
Into the night I cry

Hurry home
Come home to me
Set me free
Free from doubt
And free from longing

Into your arms I'll fly
Locked in your arms I'll stay
Waiting to hear you say
No other love have I
No other love

(Into the night I cry)

Hurry home
Come home to me
Set me free
Free from doubt
And free from longing

Into your arms I'll fly
Locked in your arms I'll stay
Waiting to hear you say
No other love have I
No other love (no other love)
No other love

// Steam Heat //

I've got steam heat
I've got steam heat
I've got steam heat
But I need your love to keep away the cold
I've got steam heat
I've got steam heat
I've got steam heat
But I can't get warm without your hand to hold

The radiator's hissin', still I need your kissin'
To keep me from freezing each night
I've got a hot water bottle, but nothing I've got'll
Take the place of you holding me tight

I've got steam heat
I've got steam heat
I've got steam heat
But I need your love to keep away the cold

They told me to shove some more coal in the boiler
They told me to shove some more coal in the boiler
They told me to shove some more coal in the boiler
But that don't do no good
They told me to pour some more oil in the burner
They told me to pour some more oil in the burner
They told me to pour some more oil in the burner
But that don't do no good

I gotta shovel more coal in the boiler
I gotta shovel more coal in the boiler
I gotta shovel more coal in the boiler
But that don't do no good
Shovel, keep shovelin'
Shovel more coal in the boiler
More coal in the boiler
But that don't do no good
The radiator's hissin', still I need your kissin'
To keep me from freezing each night
Got a hot water bottle, but nothing I've got'll
Take the place of you holding me tight

I've got steam heat
I've got steam heat
I've got steam heat
But I need your love to keep away the cold
Man, I need love real bad
Yes, I need your love real bad

// Whatever Lola Wants //

Whatever Lola wants
Lola gets
And little man, little Lola wants you
Make up your mind to have
No regrets
Recline yourself, resign yourself, you're through

I always get what I aim for
And your heart'n soul is what I came for

Whatever Lola wants Lola gets
Take off your coat
Don't you know you can't win?
You're no exception to the rule
I'm irresistible, you fool
Give in!...Give in!...Give in!

I always get what I aim for
And you heart'n soul is what I came for ...

Whatever Lola wants...
Whatever Lola wants...

Whatever Lola wants Lola gets
Take off your coat
Don't you know you can't win?
You're no exception to the rule
I'm irresistible, you fool
Give in!...Give in!...Give in!

Lola wants...
Lola gets...
You'll never win I'm irresistible, you fool
Give in!...Give in!...Give in!

// Guys And Dolls //

When you see a guy
Reach for stars in the sky
You can beat that he's doin' it for some doll
When you spot a John
Waitin' out in the rain
Chances are he's insane
As only a John can be for a Jane

When you see a mouse
Hurry out of the house
And she runs twenty blocks
For cigars and rye
Call it dumb, call it clever
Oh but you can give odds forever
That the doll's only doin' it for some guy

When you see a dame
Change the shape of her frame
You can bet she's reducing it for some guy
When you find a doll
With her diamond in hock
Rest assured that the rock
Has gone to restock
Some gentleman Jock

When you meet a gent
Payin' all kinds of rent
For a flat that could flatten the Taj Mahal
Call it sad, call it funny
But it's better than even money
That the guy's only doin' it...
He's only doin' it...
The boob is doin' it for some doll

// Somebody Somewhere //

Somebody somewhere
Wants me and needs me
That's very wonderful to know
Somebody lonely
Wants me to care
Wants me, of all people
To notice him there

Well, I want to be wanted
Need to be needed
And, I'll admit, I'm all aglow
'Cause somebody somewhere
Wants me and needs me
Wants lonely me
To smile and say, "Hello"
Somebody somewhere
Wants me and needs me
And that's very wonderful to know

Oh somebody somewhere
Wants me and needs me
Wants lonely me
To smile and say, "Hello"
Somebody somewhere
Wants me and needs me
And that's very wonderful to know
