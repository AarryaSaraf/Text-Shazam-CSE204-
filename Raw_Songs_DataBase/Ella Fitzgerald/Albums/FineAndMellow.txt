// I Can't Give You Anything But Love //

I can't give you anything but love, b-a-b-y, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Dream a while, scheme a while
We're sure to find
Happiness, and I guess
All those things you've always pined for

Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, baby
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby
Till that lucky day you know darned well, oh baby
I can't give you anything but love

[*scatting*]

Can't give you anything, anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby
I can't give you anything
I can't give you anything
I can't give you anything but love

// Round Midnight //

It begins to tell,
'round midnight, midnight.
I do pretty well, till after sundown,
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad;
But it really gets bad,
'round midnight.
Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,
When my heart is still with you,
And ol' midnight knows it, too.
When a quarrel we had needs mending,
Does it mean that our love is ending.

Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart,
And I'm out of my mind.
Let our hearts take wings'
'round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing,
For your returning.
Till our love is safe and sound.
And old midnight comes around.
Feelin' sad,
Really gets bad
Round.....round.......round....mid.....night....
