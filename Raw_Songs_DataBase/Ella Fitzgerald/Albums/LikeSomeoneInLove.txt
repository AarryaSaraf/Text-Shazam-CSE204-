// There's A Lull In My Life //

Oh, there's a lull in my life
It's just a void, an empty space
When you are not in my embrace

Oh, there's a lull in my life
The moment that you go away
There is no night, there is no day

The world stops turning, the clock stops ticking
Everything stops but that flame in my heart
That keeps burning, burning

Oh, there's a lull in my life
No matter how I may pretend
I know that you alone can end
The ache in my heart, the call of my arms

I know that you alone can end
The ache in my heart, the call of my arms
And the lull, lull in my life

// More Than You Know //

Whether you are here or yonder
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander
I'm growing fonder of you

Even though your friends forsake you
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you?
Give you the break you need

More than you know
More than you know
Man of my heart I love you so
Lately I find
You're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong
Man of my heart I'll string along
You need me so
More than you'll ever know

Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
Loving may be all you can give
But honey I can't live without it

Oh how I'd cry
Oh how I'd sigh
If you got tired and said goodbye
More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know

// What Will I Tell My Heart? //

I'll try to explain to friends dear
The reason we two are apart
I know what to tell our friends dear
But what will I tell my heart?

It's easy to say to strangers
That we played the game from the start
It's easy to lie to stranger
But why will I tell my heart?

When I smile to hide all the tears inside
What an ache it will bring
Then I'll wander home to a telephone
That forgot how to ring

I could say you'll soon be back dear
To fool the whole town may be smart
I'll tell them you'll soon be back dear
But what will I tell my heart?

I'll try to explain to friends dear
The reason we two are apart
I know what to tell our friends dear
But what will I tell my heart?
Oh baby what will I tell my heart?

// I Never Had A Chance //

I guess there's nothing to do
And nothing to say
But simply go on my way
And call it a day

I guess I'm ready to go
Right back on the shelf
Because at last I've learned
Where you're concerned
I've just been fooling myself

I never had a chance
I thought you cared for me
But now I see I never had a chance
I never had a chance
Though you never told me so
Somehow I know I never had a chance

I knew we'd have to part
For I could always reach your lips
But I could never reach your heart
My dream about romance
Ended in a friendly chat
But more than that
I never had a chance
Never had a chance
Never had a chance

// Close Your Eyes //

Close your eyes
Rest your head on my shoulder and sleep
Close your eyes
And I will close mine

Close your eyes
Let's pretend that we're both counting sheep
Close your eyes
All this is divine

Music play
Something dreamy for dancing
While were here romancing
It's love's holiday
And love will be our guide

Close your eyes
When you open them dear
I'll be near by your side
So won't you close your eyes?

Music play
Something dreamy for dancing
While were here romancing
It's love's holiday
And love will be our guide

Close your eyes
When you open them dear
I'll be near close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes

// We'll Be Together Again //

No tears
No fears
Remember there's always tomorrow
So what if we have to part
We'll be together again

Your kiss
Your smile
Are memories I'll treasure forever
So try thinking with your heart
We'll be together again

Times when I know you'll be lonesome
Times when I know you'll be sad

Don't let temptation surround you
Don't let the blues make you bad
Someday
Someway
We both have a lifetime before us
For parting is not goodbye
We'll be together again

Don't let temptation surround you
Don't let the blues make you bad
Someday
Someway
We both have a lifetime before us
For parting is not goodbye
We'll be together again
We'll be together again

// Then I'll Be Tired Of You //

I'll be tired of you
When stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming
Then I'll be tired of you

This I know is true
When winds are tired of blowing
When grass is tired of growing
Then I'll be tired of you.

Beyond the years till day is night
Till wrong is right
Till birds refuse to sing
Beyond the years the echo of my only love
Will still be whispering whispering
If my throbbing heart
Should ever start repeating
That it is tired of beating
Then I'll be tired of you

Beyond the years till day is night
Till wrong is right
Till birds refuse to sing
Beyond the years the echo of my only love
Will still be whispering whispering
If my throbbing heart
Should ever start repeating
That it is tired of beating
Then I'll be tired of you

// Like Someone In Love //

Lately I find myself out gazing at stars
Hearing guitars like someone in love
Sometimes the things I do astound me
Mostly whenever you're around me

Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings
Bump into things like someone in love

Each time I look at you I'm limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in love

Each time I look at you I'm limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in love
Feeling like someone in love

// I Thought About You //

Seems that I read or somebody said
That out of sight is out of mind
Maybe that's so but I tried to go
And leave you behind
What did I find?

I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
A winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam
Same old dream

At every stop that we made
Oh I thought about you
But when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeked through the crack and looked at the track
The one going back to you and what did I do?
I leave it to you
Oh what did I do?
I thought about you

// You're Blase //

You're deep just like a chasm
You've no, enthusiasm
You're tired and uninsipired
You're blase

Your day is one of leisure
In which you search for pleasure
You're bored when you're adored
You're blase

While reaching for the moon
And the stars up in the sky
The simple things of normal life
Are slowly passing by

You sleep, the sun is shining
You wake, it's time for dining
There's nothing new for you to do
You're blase

While reaching for the moon
And the stars up in the sky
The simple things of normal life
Are slowly passing by

You sleep, the sun is shining
You wake, it's time for dining
There's nothing new for you to do
You're blase
Blase

// Night Wind //

Love was blown away by the night wind
And the dream we shared fell apart
Now I'm all alone in the night wind
Wind that brought the blues to my heart

Yesterday my arms were around you
And your lips revealed you were mine
Then the angry wind came and found you
Came to end a moment divine

Oh that night wind seems to haunt me
Seems to taunt me now that you don't want me

Why is lover's Lane filled with shadows?
Stars no longer shine up above
I'll be waiting there in the shadows
Till the night wind brings back our love

Oh that night wind seems to haunt me
Seems to taunt me now that you don't
You don't want me

Why is lover's Lane filled with shadows?
Stars no longer shine up above
I'll be waiting there in the shadows
Till the night wind brings back our love
I'll be waiting there
Let you know I care
Till the night wind brings back our love

// What's New? //

What's new?
How is the world treating you?
You haven't changed a bit
Handsome as ever I must admit

What's new?
How did that romance come through?
We haven't met since then
Gee but it's nice to see you again

What's new?
Probably I'm boring you
But seeing you is grand
And you were sweet to offer your hand

I understand Adieu
Pardon my asking what's new
Of course you couldn't know
I haven't changed
I still love you so

What's new?
How is the world treating you?
You haven't changed a bit
Handsome as ever I must admit
But how can you know I love you so?

// Hurry Home //

I had to call you on the 'phone,
because I feel so all alone.
Don't like this being on my own,
can't you, won't you hurry home.
I'll leave the door unlocked in case
like me you find you're out of place,
I'd give the world to see your face,
can't you, won't you hurry home.

I've learned a lot that I didn't know,
I was a fool when I let you go.
Since you've been gone it's all very clear:
Life is just an empty thing without you, dear.

I made an awfully big mistake
Oh what a difference love can make.
Please give my heart another break,
can't you, won't you hurry home.

I set the clock to ring at eight.
It didn't work so I was late.
I'm worried 'cause I'm losing weight
can't you, won't you hurry home.

Our pet canary simply won't sing,
There's something wrong, the doorbell won't ring.
When you're away it's all very clear:
Life is just a bowl of sour milk, my dear.
I'm tired of eating food that's canned,
and nothing's turned out like I planned.
I know that you will understand,
can't you, won't you hurry home.

// How Long Has This Been Going On? (1957 Version) //

As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my anties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.
So my dear I swore, "Never, never more!"

On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh baby, how I've lost out!

I could cry salty tears;
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt;
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

I could cry salty tears;
Where have I been all these years?
Listen you, tell me do:
How long has this been going on?

What a kick, what a buzz;
Boy, you click as no one does!
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendez-vous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going?
How long has this been going on?
