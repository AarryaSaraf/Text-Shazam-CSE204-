Is it yes?
Is it no?
Am I in?
Am I out?

If you ain't wrong you're right
If it ain't dark it's light
If you ain't sure you might
Gotta be this or that

If it ain't full it's blank
If you don't spend you bank
If it ain't Bing it's Frank
Gotta be this or that

Who can it be if it ain't me?
I know it's not your mother
Can't you see it's gotta be
One way or the other?

Tell me what I must know
If you don't like I'll go
If it ain't yes it's no
Gotta be this or that

If it ain't old it's new
If it ain't me it's you
If it ain't much it's few
Gotta be this or that

If it ain't sea it's land
If you ain't praised you're panned
If it ain't fresh it's canned
Gotta be this or that

Who can it be if it ain't me?
I know it's not your mother
Can't you see it's gotta be
One way or the other?

Tell me what I must know
If you don't like I'll go
If it ain't yes it's no
Gotta be this
It's gotta be that
Gotta be this way
That way or the other
