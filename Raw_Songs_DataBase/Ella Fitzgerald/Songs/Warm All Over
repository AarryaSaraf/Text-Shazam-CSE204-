It makes me feel warm all over
Warm all over
Every time you smile you get me warm all over

Sometimes I feel kind of out in the cold
But then I touch your hand
And I'm home, home again
And warm all over
Warm all over

Gone are all the clouds that used to swarm all over
Please always let me keep feeling the way I do
So warm, warm all over
With a tender love for you

You touch my hand and I'm warm all over
Warm all over
Gone are all the clouds that used to swarm all over
Please always let me keep feeling the way I do
So warm all over
With a tender love for you

Warm, tender love, tender love for you
