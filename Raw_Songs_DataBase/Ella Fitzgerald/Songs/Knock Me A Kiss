Knock me a kiss hey baby
Knock me a kiss I'm in maybe
That's what I want from you really baby
Honey

I like cake and no mistake but baby if you insist
I'll cut out a cake just for your sake
Baby come on and knock me a kiss

I like pie
I hope to die just get a load of this
When you get high doggone the pie
Baby come on and knock me a kiss

When you pressed your lips to mine
It was then I understood
They taste like candy brandy and wine
Peaches bananas and everything good

I love jam and no film flam
Scratch that off my list
This ain't no jam
The jam can scram
Baby come on and knock me a kiss

I like cars and big cigars but baby they won't be missed
If everyday I hear you say
Baby come on and knock me a kiss
I crave sights like title fights but if you should insist
I cancel nights and title fights
Baby come on and knock me a kiss

Yes it's wise to compromise in such cases as this
There's nothing world
The light in your eyes
What can compare with the thrill of your kiss?

Scotch and ride are tops with me
But i promise this
If you say so I'll drink ice tea
Baby come on and knock me a kiss
Oh baby oh baby
Baby come on and knock me a kiss
