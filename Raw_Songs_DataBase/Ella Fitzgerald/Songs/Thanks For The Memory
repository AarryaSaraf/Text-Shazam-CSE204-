Thanks for the memory
Of candlelight and wine
Castles on the Rhine
The Parthenon
And moments on
The Hudson River line
How lovely it was

Thanks for the memory
Of rainy afternoons
Swingy Harlem tunes
And motor trips and burning lips
And burning toast and prunes
How lovely it was

Many's the time that we feasted
And many's the time that we fasted
Oh well, it was swell while it lasted
We did have fun
And no harm done
So, thanks for the memory
And strictly entre nous
Darling, how are you
And how are all the little dreams
That never did come true
Awfully glad I met you
Cheerio and toodle-oo
And thank you so much
