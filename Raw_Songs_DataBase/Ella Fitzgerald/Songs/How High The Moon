Until I fell in love, my life was very easy
The moon just made it moonlight
The breeze just made it breezy
And then I fell in love
And think that one was clear
Now I scare to see or hear

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
It's where you are
Somewhere there's heaven
How near, how far
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

How high-high-high-high the moon
It's where you are
Somewhere there's heaven
How-how near-ear-ear, how far
The darkest night would shine
And if you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How-how-how-how-how-how-how high the moon

How-how high the moon
How high the moon
How high the moon
