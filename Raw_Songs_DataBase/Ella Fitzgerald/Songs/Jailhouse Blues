This house is surely getting raided
Yes, sir

30 days in jail
With my back turned to the wall
30 days in jail
With my back turned to the wall
Look here Mr. Jailkeeper
Put another gal in my stall

I don't mind being in jail
But I gotta stay there so long
I don't mind being in jail
But I gotta stay there so long
Every friend I've had
Done shook hands and gone

Better stop your man
From tickling me under my chin
Better stop your man
From tickling me under my chin
If he keeps on tickling
I'm gonna lick him on in

Good morning blues
Blues, how do you do?
Good morning blues
Blues, how do you do?
I just came here to have a few words
Have a few words with you

When a blues first got on me
They poured like a shower of rain
When a blues first got on me
They poured like a shower of rain
And I cried all night, honey
Ain't that a shame?

Going up to the country
And I can't take you
On up to the country and I can't take you
Nothing in the country
That a monkey man can do
