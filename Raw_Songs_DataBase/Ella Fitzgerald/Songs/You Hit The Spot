You hit the spot
Like a balmy breeze on a night in May
You hit the spot
Like a cool mint julep on a summery day
You hit a new high in my estimation
I have to fall
Cause you've got so much on the ball

Oh you hit the spot
Like the first embrace with a modest tide
You hit the spot
Like the pipe and slippers by the fireside
Matter of factly don't know exactly
What it is that you've got
But ooh you hit the spot

You hit the spot
Like a balmy breeze on a night in May
You hit the spot
Like a cool mint julep on a summery day
You hit a new high in my estimation
I have to fall
Cause you've got so much on the ball

Oh you hit the spot
Like the first embrace with a modest tide
You hit the spot
Like the pipe and slippers by the fireside
Matter of factly don't know exactly
What it is that you've got
But ooh you hit the spot
