So rare
You're like the fragrance of blossoms fair
Sweet as a breath of air
Fresh with the morning dew

So rare
You're like the sparkle of old champagne
Orchids in cellophane
Couldn't compare to you

You are perfection
You're my idea
Of angels singing the Ave Maria
For you're an angel
I'd breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you

So rare
This is a heaven on earth we share
Caring the way we care
Ours is a love so rare

Yes you're an angel
I'd breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you

So rare
This is a heaven on earth we share
Caring the way we care
Ours is a love so rare
So rare
Ours is a love so rare
