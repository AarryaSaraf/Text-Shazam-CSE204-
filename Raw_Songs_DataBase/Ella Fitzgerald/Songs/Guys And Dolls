When you see a guy
Reach for stars in the sky
You can beat that he's doin' it for some doll
When you spot a John
Waitin' out in the rain
Chances are he's insane
As only a John can be for a Jane

When you see a mouse
Hurry out of the house
And she runs twenty blocks
For cigars and rye
Call it dumb, call it clever
Oh but you can give odds forever
That the doll's only doin' it for some guy

When you see a dame
Change the shape of her frame
You can bet she's reducing it for some guy
When you find a doll
With her diamond in hock
Rest assured that the rock
Has gone to restock
Some gentleman Jock

When you meet a gent
Payin' all kinds of rent
For a flat that could flatten the Taj Mahal
Call it sad, call it funny
But it's better than even money
That the guy's only doin' it...
He's only doin' it...
The boob is doin' it for some doll
