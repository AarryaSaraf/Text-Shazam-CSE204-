Rambling man makes no change in me
I'm gonna ramble back to my used to be

Ah, you hear me talking to you
I don't bite my tongue
You wanna be my man
You got to fetch it with you when you come

Eve and Adam in the garden taking a chance
Adam didn't take time to get his pants

Ah, you hear me talking to you
I don't bite my tongue
You wanna be my man
You got to fetch it with you when you come

I don't care whether they're old or young
When the chips were down they had to trouble the Lord

Ah yes, you hear me talking to you
I don't bite my tongue
You wanna be my man
You got to fetch it with you when you come

Hello Central, give me 609
What it takes to get it in these hips of mine

Ah yes, you hear me talking to you
I don't bite my tongue
You wanna be my man
You got to fetch it with you when you come
