There he stood in my doorway so boldly
And he whispered of pleasures I'd missed
Though at first I refused very coldly
How long can a lady resist?
How long can a lady resist?

I said "No", he said "Please"
I said "No", he said "Please"
I said "No", he said "Please, pretty baby"
I said "No", he said "Why?"
I said "No", he said "Why?"
I said "No", he said "Try"
I said "Maybe"
He said "Now?"
I said "Well"
He said "Ah, this is swell
And you'll never know how much it will mean"
So at last, I confess
I said "Yes, yes yes yes"
That's how I subscribed
To Liberty Magazine

Now I subscribed
To the magazine
And fell in love with a guy
But he didn't dig me
He had no eyes
And now I've really got to try

He said "No", I said "Please"
He said "No", I said "Please"
He said "No", I said "Please, come on baby"
He said "No", I said "Why?"
He said "No", I said "Why?"
He said "No", I said "Try"
He said "Oh, well maybe"
I said "Now?"
He said "Well"
Ah, he said "Ah, this is swell"
And the moonlight in his eyes was sublime
So at last, I confess
Ah, he said "Yes, yes yes yes"
That's how I subscribed
To Esquire
And uh, the Rouge and the Stag
And the Cavalier
And the Field and Stream
Now let me see, oh yes, I forgot
That's how I subscribed
To Playboy Magazine
