Baby doll,
You beautiful baby doll,
Let's go home and tell my mother
That I've found a baby brother!

I'm taking you off the shelf
And showin' you off myself!
Can't you see it now you're taking me walkin',
Holding my parasol?
Aah honey, there's no use talkin',
You're a beautiful baby doll!

Oh baby baby baby doll,
You beautiful baby baby doll,
Rush home and tell your mother
You've found a baby brother!

I'm takin' you off the shelf
And showin' you off myself!
Can't you see it now you're taking me walkin',
Holding my parasol?
Aah honey, there's no use talkin',
You're a beautiful baby doll!
Baby doll,
You're a beautiful baby baby doll!
