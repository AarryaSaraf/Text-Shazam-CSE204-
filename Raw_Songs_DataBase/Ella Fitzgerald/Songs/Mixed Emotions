I have mixed emotions
When it comes to loving you
I know I shouldn't like the things you shouldn't do
But if you were perfect
It wouldnt be the same
To a tiger a tiger's not a tiger if he's tame

But when you're near me I am happy just alone with you
But when you're far away from me I'm awfully blue
You're the bitter and the sweet combined
So what am I to do
I have mixed emotions over you

All of the time you confuse me
Oh yes I have mixed emotions
When it comes to loving you
I know I shouldn't like the things you shouldn't do
You're the bitter and the sweet combined
So what am I to do
Oh confuse
Mixed emotions
Over you
Mixed emotions
It's like you're dreaming, you're falling
And waking, a balling
I have these mixed emotions all because of you
