Can't buy me love
Can't buy me love
Can't buy me love

I'll buy you a diamond ring, my friend
If it makes you feel alright
I'll get you anything, my friend
If it makes you feel alright

For I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

I'll give you all I've got to give
If you'd say you love me too
I may not have an awful lot
But what I've got I'd give to you

For I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love
Can't buy me love
Love
Can't buy me love

Say you don't need no diamond ring
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want those kind of things
That money just can't buy

I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love
Don't want money
Who wants money?
I don't care too much for money
'Cause money can't buy me love

Say you don't need no diamond ring
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want those kind of things
That money just can't buy

For I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love

Money can't buy me love
Money cannot buy me love
No, no, money can't buy me love
