Close your eyes
Rest your head on my shoulder and sleep
Close your eyes
And I will close mine

Close your eyes
Let's pretend that we're both counting sheep
Close your eyes
All this is divine

Music play
Something dreamy for dancing
While were here romancing
It's love's holiday
And love will be our guide

Close your eyes
When you open them dear
I'll be near by your side
So won't you close your eyes?

Music play
Something dreamy for dancing
While were here romancing
It's love's holiday
And love will be our guide

Close your eyes
When you open them dear
I'll be near close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
