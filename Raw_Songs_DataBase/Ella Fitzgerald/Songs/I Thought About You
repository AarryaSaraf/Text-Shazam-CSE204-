Seems that I read or somebody said
That out of sight is out of mind
Maybe that's so but I tried to go
And leave you behind
What did I find?

I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
A winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam
Same old dream

At every stop that we made
Oh I thought about you
But when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeked through the crack and looked at the track
The one going back to you and what did I do?
I leave it to you
Oh what did I do?
I thought about you
