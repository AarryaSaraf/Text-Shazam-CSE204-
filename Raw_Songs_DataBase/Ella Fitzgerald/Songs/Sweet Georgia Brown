No gal made has got a shade on sweet Georgia Brown
Two left feet but oh so neat, has sweet Georgia Brown
They all sigh and wanna die for sweet Georgia Brown
I'll tell you why, you know I don't lie... much

It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town
Since she came why it's a shame how she coos 'em down
Fellers she can't get are fellers she ain't met
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her
Sweet Georgia Brown
