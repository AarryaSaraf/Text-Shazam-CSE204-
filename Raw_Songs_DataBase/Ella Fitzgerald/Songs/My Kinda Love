My kinda love
Your kinda love
Keeps me believing although you're deceiving
My kinda love
One way to paradise

My kinda lips
Your kinda lips
When love comes stealing encourage that feeling
My kinda love
One way to paradise

Although you're happy today
You may be gone tomorrow
Love comes but once don't be a dunce
When you need it
Steal it
Beg or borrow

I'm fond of you
You're fond of me
Tell me you love me and hug me and squeeze me
My kinda love
One way to paradise

Although you're happy today
You may be gone tomorrow
Love comes but once don't be a dunce
When you need it
Try to keep it

I'm fond of you
You're fond of me
Tell me you love me and hug me and squeeze me
Your kinda love
Your kind was meant just for me

Steal for it
Beg for or borrow
We may be gone tomorrow
Hug me and squeeze me
One way to paradise
