The one I love belongs to somebody else
He means his tender songs for somebody else
And even when I have my arms around him
I know his thoughts are strong for somebody else
I know the hands I hold belong to somebody else
I'll bet they're not so cold to somebody else
It's tough to be alone on the shelf
It's worse to fall in love by yourself
The one I love belongs to somebody else
The one I love belongs to somebody else

The one I love belongs to somebody else
He means his tender songs for somebody else
And even when I have my arms around him
I know his thoughts are strong for somebody else
I know the hands I hold belong to somebody else
I'll bet they're not so cold to somebody else
It's tough to be alone on the shelf
It's worse to fall in love by yourself
The one I love belongs to somebody else
Yeah the one I love belongs to somebody else
The one I love belongs to somebody else
