Oh I hate to see that evening sun go down
Yes I hate to see that evening sun go down
Just because my baby he has gone and left this town
If I'm feeling tomorrow just like a feel today
If I'm feeling feeling tomorrow just like a feel today
I'm gonna pack my trunk and make my getaway

St. Louis woman with all her diamond rings
Pulls that man around by her apron strings
If it wasn't for powder and for store bought hair
The man I love wouldn't gone nowhere
Nowhere

Got the St. Louis blues blue as I can be
Got the St. Louis blues blue as I can be
My man got a heart like a rock cast in the deep blue sea

He may be your man but he comes to see me sometime
Yes he may be your man but he comes to see me sometime
Live six flights up and that man he sure love to climb

Wouldn't give a blind sparrow an acorn
Wouldn't give a crippled crab a crutch
Wouldn't give a blind sparrow an acorn
Wouldn't give a crippled crab a crutch

Ain't gonna give you nothing
Cause you think you're such a much and much
Got the St. Louis got the St. Louis
Got the blues got the blues got the blues blue as I can be



Mississippi river long deep wide
I got to meet my sweet man on the other side
Take me back to St. Louis back to St. Louis
Got the St. Louis Blues just as blue as I can be
