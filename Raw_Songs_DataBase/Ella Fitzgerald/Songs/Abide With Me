(Help of the helpless, oh abide with me)

Abide with me, fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, oh abide with me

I need Thy presence every passing hour
What but Thy precious grace (can foil thy tempter's power?)
Can keep me every hour
(Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?)
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me

Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies
Heaven's morning breaks, and Earth's vain shadows flee
Help of the helpless, oh abide with me
In life, in death, oh Lord, abide with me
