Somebody somewhere
Wants me and needs me
That's very wonderful to know
Somebody lonely
Wants me to care
Wants me, of all people
To notice him there

Well, I want to be wanted
Need to be needed
And, I'll admit, I'm all aglow
'Cause somebody somewhere
Wants me and needs me
Wants lonely me
To smile and say, "Hello"
Somebody somewhere
Wants me and needs me
And that's very wonderful to know

Oh somebody somewhere
Wants me and needs me
Wants lonely me
To smile and say, "Hello"
Somebody somewhere
Wants me and needs me
And that's very wonderful to know
