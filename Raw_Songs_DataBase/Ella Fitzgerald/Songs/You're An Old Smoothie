You're an old smoothie
I'm an old softie
I'm just like putty in the hands of a boy like you

You're an old meanie
I'm a big boobie
I just go nutty in the hands of a boy like you

Poor me
You played me for a sap
Poor you
You thought you'd laid a trap
Well dear I think it's time you knew
You've done just what I wanted you to

Silly old smoothie
Crafty old softie
I'll stick like putty to the hand of a boy like you

Poor me
You played me for a sap
Poor you
You thought you'd laid a trap
Well dear I think it's time you knew
You've done just what I wanted you to

Silly old smoothie
Crafty old softie
I'll stick like putty to the hand of a boy
A boy like you
I just go nutty in the hands of a boy like you
