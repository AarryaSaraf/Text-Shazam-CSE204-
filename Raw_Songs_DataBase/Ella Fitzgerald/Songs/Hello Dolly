Hello Harry, well, hello Louise
It's so nice to be back where I belong
You're looking great, Mary, I can tell, Jerry
You're still glowing, you're still crowing
You're still going strong

I feel the room swaying for the band's playing
One of my old favourite songs from way back when
So here's my hat, fellas, find me an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again

Hello Harry, well, hello Louise
It's so nice to be back home where I belong
You're looking great, Stanley, lose some weight, Stanley
You're still glowing, you're still growing
You're still going strong

I feel the room swaying for the band's playing
One of my old favourite songs from way back when
So wow, oh wow, fellas, looking at all got loud, fellas
Dolly, you'll never go away
Dolly, you'll never go away
No, no, Dolly will never, ever go away again
