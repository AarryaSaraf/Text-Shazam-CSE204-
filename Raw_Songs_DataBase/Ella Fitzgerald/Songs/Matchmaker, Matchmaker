Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match
Find me a find, catch me a catch
Matchmaker, matchmaker, look through your book
And make me a perfect match

Matchmaker, matchmaker, I'll bring the veil
You bring the groom, slender and pale
Bring me a ring, for I'm longing to be
The envy of all I see

For Papa, make him a scholar
For Mama, make him rich as a king
For me, well, I wouldn't holler
If he were as handsome as anything

Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match
Find me a find, catch me a catch
Night after night, in the dark, I'm alone
So, find me a find, make me match of my own

For Papa, make him a scholar
For Mama, make him rich as a king
For me, well, I wouldn't holler
If he were as handsome as anything

Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match
Find me a find, catch me a catch
Night after night, in the dark, I'm alone
So, find me a find, make me match of my own

Matchmaker, matchmaker, catch me a catch
Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match
Find me a find, catch me a catch
Matchmaker, matchmaker, find me a find, catch me a catch
Find me a find, make me a match
