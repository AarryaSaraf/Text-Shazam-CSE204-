I'm out doin' the usual places
And I'm livin' it, like young
Then I dig me this face of all faces
He's the craziest, like young

He drinks coffee at Cafe Espresso
He reads Kerouac, like young
He goes where all the angry young men go
Recites poetry, like young

We start blowin' the pad around 'leven
And we're homin' it, like now
We spin records on cloud number seven
And he's reachin' me, like wow

I'm all unstrung 'cause, man
He's got me feelin' like young
If he were to brush me and go
I'm starting to wear my hair again
Like a square again

I keep gettin' the kookiest notion
I think maybe it's like love
I've been feelin' a crazy emotion
I think, baby, it's like love

Now we're ridin' a rainbow to Cloudsville
And we're makin' it like young
Love soft as April snow
Love warm as candle glow
Love, love is easy to go

I'm all unstrung 'cause, man
He's got me feelin' like young
Without him I'm no good at all
Without him I'm less than a decimal
Infinitesimal

I keep gettin' the kookiest notion
I think maybe it's like love
I've been feelin' a crazy emotion
I think, baby, it's like love

Now we're ridin' a rainbow to Cloudsville or Wowsville
We're makin' it, makin' it like, like, like young
