Who's sorry now, who's sorry now?
Whose heart is aching for breaking each vow?
Who's sad and blue, who's crying too?
Just like I cried over you

Right to the end, just like a friend
I tried to warn you somehow
You had your way, now you must pay
I'm glad that you're sorry now

Right to the end, just like a friend
I tried to warn you somehow
You, you had your way, now you must pay
I'm glad that you're sorry
I'm glad that you're sorry
I'm glad that you're sorry now
