You make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual

The moment that you speak
I want to go play hide and seek
I want to go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forget-me-not

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung and a wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
You make me feel so young

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung and a wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
You make me feel so, you make me feel so
You make me feel so young
