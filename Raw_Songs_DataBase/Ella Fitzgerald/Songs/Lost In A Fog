Like a ship at sea
I'm just lost in a fog
My mind is hazy
My thoughts are blue
Guess I'll always be
Kinda lost in a fog without you

Waiting night and day
Like a bump on a log
I'm going crazy
What can I do?
Help me find my way
Cause I'm lost in a fog without you

It was sunny everyday
The sky was fair above
But you took the light away
The day you took your love
Only fools like me could be tossed in a fog
I've got a heartache I never knew
Guess I'll always be
Kinda lost in a fog without you

It was sunny everyday
The sky was fair above
But you took the light away
The day you took your love
Only fools like me could be tossed in a fog
I've got a heartache I never knew
Guess I'll always be
Kinda lost in a fog without you
I guess I'll always be lost in a fog
Without you
