See, see rider, see what you have done
Lord, Lord, Lord, made me love you, now your gal has come
You made me love you, now your gal has come

I'm goin' away, baby, I won't be back 'til fall
Lord, Lord, Lord, goin' away, baby, I won't be back 'til fall
If I find me a good man, won't be back at all

I'm gonna buy me a pistol, just as long as I am tall
Lord, Lord, Lord, shoot my man and catch a cannonball
If he won't have me, he won't have no gal at all

See, see rider, where did you stay last night?
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, your shoes ain't buttoned
Your clothes don't fit you right
You didn't come home until,'til the sun was shining bright
