Sweet and slow
Rock-a-by me to and fro
While the band is moaning low
Honey take your time
Sweet and slow
We ain't got no place to go
We ain't going to buffalo
Honey take your time

You heard about the turtle
And the rabbit ran a race
You heard about the rabbit
Ended up in second place
Sweet and slow
While these lights are burning low
Honey I know
We can make it if we take it
Sweet and slow

Sweet and slow
While these lights are burning low
Honey I know
We can make it if we take it
Sweet and slow
