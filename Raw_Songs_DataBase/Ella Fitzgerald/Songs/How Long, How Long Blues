Tell me, baby, how long?
Baby, how long
Has that evenin' train been gone?
How long?
How long?
Baby, how long?

Heard the whistle blowin'
Couldn't see no train
Way down in my heart I had an achin' pain
How long?
Baby, how long?

I'm sad and lonely all the whole day through
Why don't you write me and give me the news?
You have left me, yes, you left me
Singin' the blues, those how long blues

If I could holler like the mountain jack
I'd go up on a mountain and call my baby back
Tell me how long?
How long?
Oh, how long?

I went up on a mountain
Looked as far as I could see
That woman had my man
And the blues had poor me
Yes, tell me, baby
Tell me, baby, how long?
How long must I go on like this?

The brook runs into the river
The river runs into the sea
If I don't run into my baby a train is goin' to run into me
How long? How long?
How long?

I say
I'm sad and lonely all the whole day through
Why don't you write me?
Tell me, baby, what's the news?
You have left me, left me
Singin' those how long blues
