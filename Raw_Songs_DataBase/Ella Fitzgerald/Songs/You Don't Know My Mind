I went to the racetrack, my man he won
Gave the money to another gal and wouldn't give me none

You don't know, you don't know my mind
You see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin'

I said to papa, "Can you stand to see me cry?"
He said, "Gal, I can stand to see you die."

You don't know, you don't know my mind
You see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin'

He said he didn't want me, I wasn't good enough
I'm gonna get myself another man and call his bluff

You don't know, you don't know my mind
'Cause when you see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin'

I'm not good lookin', I don't dress fine
But I'm the kind of woman who will take her time

You don't know, you don't know my mind
You see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin'

The grass is green, and the mountains are blue
That's not tellin' what I'm thinkin' about you

You don't know, you don't know my mind
Yeah you see me laughin', laughin' just to keep from cryin'

I said you don't know, you never know
I said you don't know, you don't know, you don't know my mind
When you see me laughin', I'm laughin' just to keep from cryin'
