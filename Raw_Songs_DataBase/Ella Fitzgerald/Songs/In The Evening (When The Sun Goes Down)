In the evening, in the evening
Baby, when the sun goes down
In the evening, in the evening
Baby, when the sun goes down

Oh it ain't lonesome, man ain't lonesome
When your lover can't be found
When the sun goes down

Last night I lay a-sleeping
Thinkin' to myself
Last night I lay a-sleeping
Thinkin' to myself

Well I thought you love me
Finally love somebody else
When the sun goes down

Goodbye my sweet and lovin' baby
You know I'm goin' away
Be back to see you baby
Some old rainy day

Well in the evenin', in the evenin'
When the ruby sun goes down
Goes down
