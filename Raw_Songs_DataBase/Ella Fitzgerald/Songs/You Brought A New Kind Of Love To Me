If the nightingales could sing like you
They'd sing much sweeter than they do
For you brought a new kind of love to me

If the sandman brought me dreams of you
I'd want to sleep my whole life through
For you brought a new kind of love to me

I know that I'm the slave you're the king
But still you can understand that underneath it all
You're a man and I am only a maid

I would work and slave the whole day through
If I could hurry home to you
For you brought a new kind of love to me

I know that I'm the slave you're the king
But still you can understand that underneath it all
You're a man and I am only a maid

I would work and slave the whole day through
If I could hurry home to you
For you brought a new kind of love
Yes you came from heaven above
For you brought a new kind of love to me
