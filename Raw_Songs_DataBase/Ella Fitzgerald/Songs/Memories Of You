Waking skies
At sunrise
Every sunset too
Seems to be
Bringing me
Memories of you

Here and there
Everywhere
Scenes that we once knew
And they all
Just recall
Memories of you

How I wish I could forget
Those happy yesteryears
That have left a rosary of tears

Your face beams
In my dreams
Spite of all I do
Everything
Seems to bring
Memories
Memories of you
