Every time it rains
I think of you
And that's the time
I feel so blue
When the rain starts falling
My love comes tumbling down
And it's raining
Teardrops from my eyes

Well if you see clouds
Here in my eyes
It's just because
You said goodbye
Although the sun is shining
There's no more summer skies
And it's raining
Teardrops from my eyes

Remember the night you told me
Our love would always be
I wouldn't be blue and lonely
If you'd come back to me
Every single cloud
Would disappear
I'd wear a smile
If you were here
So baby won't you hurry?
Cause I miss you so
And it's raining
Teardrops from my eyes

Remember the night you told me
Our love would always be
I wouldn't be blue and lonely
If you'd come back to me
Every single cloud
Would disappear
I'd wear a smile
If you were here
So baby won't you hurry?
Cause I miss you so
And it's raining
Teardrops from my eyes

So baby won't you hurry?
Cause I miss you so
And it's raining
How it's pouring
Teardrops
Teardrops in my eyes
