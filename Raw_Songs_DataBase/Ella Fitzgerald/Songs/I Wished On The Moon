I wished on the moon, for something I never knew
Wished on the moon, for more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky, an April day
That would not dance away

I begged of the stars to throw me a beam or two
Wished on the stars and asked for a dream or two
I looked for every loveliness, it all came true
I wished on the moon .... for you
