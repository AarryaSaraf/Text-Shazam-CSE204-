When I came to you I, saw a light of understanding
Maybe, you are only, left with that tree
That tree

Bum, bum, bum, bum

Ooooh
I have, a lot of things to
Share with you
You

Tonight, tonight, haaaaaight, aaaahhh, haaaaaaaa, aaaa

When you, were the showcase
There was action, all over me
Now that, we are backstage
There's a lot, a looooot, a loooot of things to referee
To referee
To referee
Referee
