When I clung to you
There was nothing to
Hold on tight with
You left me adrift

Colorado, Colorado, Colorado
Colorado, Colorado, Colorado
Colorado, Colorado, Colorado
Colorado, Colorado, Colorado

What now, what now, what now, what now?
What now, what now, what now, what now?
What now, what now, what now, what now?
What now, what now, what now, what now?

Colorado, Colorado, Colorado
Colorado, Colorado, Colorado
Colorado, Colorado, Colorado
Colorado, Colorado, Colorado

What now, what now, what now, what now?
What now, what now, what now, what now?
What now, what now, what now, what now?
What now, what now, what now, what now?
