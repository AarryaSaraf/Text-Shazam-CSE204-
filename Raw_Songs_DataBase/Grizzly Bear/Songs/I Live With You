Been gone too long
Return
Don't make me beg

And they'll try
They'll try
They'll try
To keep us apart

And they'll try, they'll try
They'll try
To keep us apart
But yes we can

You brought us this far
We'll do what we can

Return
Don't put me on
Return
Don't make me beg

Return

And they'll try
They'll try
They'll try
To keep us apart

And you'll try, you all try
You'll try
To keep us apart
But yes we can

You brought us this far
We'll do what we can
