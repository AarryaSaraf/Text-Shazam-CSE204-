Canceled flights, limousines
Hustle, bustle, crazy scenes
First you're here, then you're there
Pretty soon, then you've been everywhere

Ooh, this planet's on fire
Ah, Satan's desire
We've seen the rise, we'll see the fall
He's here to see us all
Burn in Hell

Well, time ticks away, faster, faster
You run so fast; you forget what you're after
Make a deal to sell your soul
Just to find out, baby, it's been sold
"Ha!" you sucker! Hey?!

Ooh, this planet's on fire
Ah, Satan's desire
We've seen the rise, we'll see the fall
He's here to see us all
Burn in Hell
Burn in Hell

Ooh, this planet's on fire
Ah, Satan's desire
We've seen the rise, we'll see the fall
He's here to see us all
Burn in Hell

Fine, white lines of crystal light
Keep us up all day and all night
Yeah, we're just forgotten boys and girls
Who thrive on cosmic toys

Ooh, this planet's on fire
Ah, Satan's desire
We've seen the rise, we'll see the fall
He's here to see us all
Burn in Hell
Burn in Hell

This planet's on fire
This planet's on fire
Ooh, this planet's on fire
Ah, Satan's desire
Ooh, this planet's on fire
Ah, Satan's desire
