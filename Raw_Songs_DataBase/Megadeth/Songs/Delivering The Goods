Feeling like we're ready to kick tonight
No hesitating, body's aching
Looking for some action
Satisfaction all right
Charging, vein faced
As active as one-hundred solid proof
Megaton, Leviathan
We're ready to hit the roof

You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Ooh, delivering the goods
Whoa, delivering the goods

Shake down, rock 'em boys
Crack that whip strap mean
Pulse rate, air waves
Battle lies in every place we've been
Stealing your hearts
All across the land
Hot blood doing good
We're going to load you with our brand

You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Ooh, delivering the goods
Whoa, delivering the goods

Have it your way
Stealing your hearts

Well, we don't pull no punches
We aim where the crunch is
Bound to do most damage to your brain
If you're looking for it mellow
You're nothing more than yellow
Gonna do it again and again
We'll beat you to submission
So you might as well surrender
You got to learn your lesson
'Cause there ain't nobody here to defend your heart

Faster, higher
Until it seems that we're gonna break
Oh, shooting further
Giving more than you're ever gonna take
Leaving with your heads
Crushed out on the floor
Begging for mercy
Be careful or we'll do it some more

You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Ooh, delivering the goods
Whoa, delivering the goods
Yeah, delivering the goods
Whoa, delivering the goods
