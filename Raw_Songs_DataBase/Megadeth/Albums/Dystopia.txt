// The Threat Is Real //

Justified obliteration, no one cares anymore
The Messiah or mass murderer
No controlling who comes through the door
A culture made of cover-ups
Will leprosy touch their flesh?
For backroom meetings and rendezvous
The vultures have come home to nest
The clock runs out, the weakest link
A deadly strike, the threat is real!

See the burnished images of
A crest fallen agency
Violent conditioning, caused the nature of the enemy
Your terminal lack of vision
Blinded eyes see no light
A chronic lack of perspective
Their cancer now eats us alive
A fatal shot, a lust for blood
The final act, the threat is real!

Justified obliteration, no one cares anymore
The Messiah or mass murderer
No controlling who comes through the door
A culture made of cover-ups
Will leprosy touch their flesh?

The clock runs out, the weakest link
A deadly strike, the threat is real!
A fatal shot, a lust for blood
The final act, the threat is real!

// Dystopia //

"What you don't know" the legend goes "can't hurt you"
If you only want to live and die in fear
They tell us to believe just half of what we see
And absolutely nothing that we hear

Resist the twist to truth no matter what the cost
Supplant the rights with wrongs inside our heads
Outlawing all the questions to the answers
That no one likes when someone ends up dead

"What you don't know" the legend goes "can't hurt you"
If you only want to live and die in a cage
There's panic and there's chaos, rampant in the streets
Where useless thoughts of peace are met with rage

Demoralized and overmastered people think
The quickest way to end a war is lose
Dictatorship ends starting with tyrannicide
You must destroy the cancer at it's root

// Fatal Illusion //

Lost inside the system, locked away without a key
No one will ever miss a menace to society
A gross lack of potential, bad decisions made in spite
A touchy hairpin trigger and such a wasted life

Trying to break the mold of a broken family
Fight against your failure, and living on his knees
Guilty of a crime of nonconformity
A hanging judge and jury handing down the penalty

A lethal injection, now they watch the body jerk
Exterminate the problem, except it didn't work

No vital sign of life, they declared it wasn't there
Coroner never checked, because he didn't fucking care
Passing off the body, they all believe he died
Starting up the hearse, now for a final drive

Like whistling past a graveyard, when walking by at night
It's a fatal illusion to think that evil never dies

In a darkened mortuary, reeking of formaldehyde
Aroused from deadly slumber, something opened up his eyes
Spilling all their blood was a promise that he'd keep
Hate so strong revived him from a deep necrotic sleep
Clawing away the casket lid until his fingers bleed
He grabbed a knife and set out on a vivisection spree
A butcher, hell bent, massacring each one with his blade
From the first one to the last, he dispatched them to the grave

It's a fatal illusion...

Evil never dies
It never dies

// Death From Within //

The heat is raging from the rising fires of war
Embers of avarice soon begin to soar
Vengeance breeding greater vengeance, two eyes for one eye
Crowning burning hatred that's lying deep inside

A token gift, destroyers deep within its hold
Revenge of patient men is sweet and best served cold
The enemy inside the belly of the beast
A mighty Trojan horse, tonight the sentries sleep

On the march... No place to run
Time has come... No where to hide
The moon is red... No one is safe
From spilling blood... no living thing survives

Here they fight... regretting nothing
Here you die... the walls are caving in
Nothing left... a lethal encounter
Its judgment time... when death comes from within

Warning signs ignored, they have all but been denied
Prophets and messengers, mocked and vilified
Final destination lying deep inside their court
Their first line of defense soon became their last resort

Hardened deceivers entered through their open gates
Silent trained assassins, lying still, in wait

On the march... No place to run
Time has come... No where to hide
The moon is red... No one is safe
From spilling blood... no living thing survives

Here they fight... regretting nothing
Here you die... the walls are caving in
Nothing left... a lethal encounter
Its judgment time... when death comes from within

Death from within...

// Bullet To The Brain //

No one knows what draws the moth to the flame
And nothing costs as much as playing the game
She had to know, know, know... he'd give love for sex
He had to know, know, know... she'd give sex for love

The taste, touching his tongue, sweet to his lips
Poison, now penetrating deeper
Betrayed by just one bite, for just one night
To find forbidden fruit tastes sweeter

Just like pressing a loaded gun to your head
One knows only the spider can navigate its web
She had to know, know, know... he'd get what he wants
He had to know, know, know... she'd get what she needs

Soon under the spell, emotions are high
Mind control penetrating deeper
The hex was cast on him, all he believes
Now is forbidden fruit tastes sweeter

She had to know, know, know... he'd win at the start
He had to know, know, know... she'd win in the end

His one last thought blew his mind, bullet to the brain
Hot lead was penetrating deeper
Just one reckless shot squeezed from the hand
That knows forbidden fruit tastes sweeter

// Post-American World //

We see each other through different eyes
Segregating ourselves by class and size
It's me against you in everything that they do
This planet's become one big spinning disaster

If you don't like where we're going
Then you won't like what's coming next

What will we look like?
In a post American world
Why cower to all those
Who oppose the American world?

When you walk away from that which makes you strong
You only fool yourself; you only weaken your cause
There's creeping hate if you resist the false narrative
Crushing all the dissenters who still think for them selves

If you don't like where we're going
Then you won't like what's coming next

What will we look like?
In a post American world
Why cower to all those
Who oppose the American world?

// Poisonous Shadows //

How much pain, do you need to feel.
How much shame, do you have to conceal.
There is no sunshine, just endless nights.
Nobody's there, nobody cares when you cry.

Is it my face you see?
Do I haunt you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares.

When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Crawling everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows.

How many secrets, do you keep inside?
How many sins, do you have to hide?
The haunting masses, have blackened the sun.
You'll pay for everything you've done
One by one.

Is it my face you see?
Do I mock you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares.

When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Crawling everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows.

Is it my face you see?
Do I haunt you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares.

When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Crawling everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows.

Is it my face you see?
Do I haunt you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares.
When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Crawling everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows.
(It's like I woke up and she was right there
you know, I can almost touch her
although she's been gone for years now
I can feel her
I can feel her watching me)

// Look Who's Talking //

People tell me you've been talking
I hear you've got a big mouth
Saying things you know aren't true
What the hell are you talking about?

So, now we have a conundrum
And the problem is clearly you
This is the part where it gets ugly
And the solution; getting rid of you

You'll never be safe in the shadows
I'll be waiting in the dark
With a shovel and a bag full of lime
I'll say the devil made me do it

I look who's talking and I see
A big nothing looking back at me
Mine is just to do or die, it's not to reason why
I can't let sleeping dogs that lie, lie

Don't you think I have friends besides you?
You called me out, you couldn't resist
I'll never stop until I find you
That's when you're gonna cease to exist

How stupid do you have to be?
To think the trail of evidence that you've left
Won't boomerang back in your face
To your moth-eaten brain by meth

Like the wolf that does not howl
Concealed and ready to attack
It's time to pay with your flesh
And you'll never stop me

I look who's talking and I see
A big nothing looking back at me
Mine is just to do or die, it's not to reason why
I can't let sleeping dogs that lie, lie

The dogs that bark the loudest are the dogs that have no teeth

I look who's talking and I see
A big nothing looking back at me
Mine is just to do or die, it's not to reason why
I can't let sleeping dogs that lie, lie

Look at you!
Look who's talking, a big nothing looking back at me
Would you look at you?
Look who's talking, a big nothing, that's all I see
Won't you look at you?
Look who's talking, a big nothing, it's what you mean to me
Oh, but you're never gonna be anything anyway
Now roll over and play dead

// Lying In State //

What we are witnessing is the decline of western civilization
Crushing our potential and piling it on, how will history portray us?
Attack the family, attack their faith and dreams
Attack the body and the head will fall

A lasting legacy or ruin brought in haste?
The enemy of truth is lying there in state

Another day, another manufactured crisis keeping the people distracted
There's no one playing by the rules anymore, how will history portray us?
A broken backbone with nothing left to lose?
That hate the sight of all the ones that do?

A lasting legacy or ruin brought in haste?
The enemy of truth is lying there in state

A shiny new agenda, birthed from a depraved mind
Of failing us on purpose, to culturally sanitize
Its opiates for the masses under cloak as hope and change
The "new normal" or just more of the same?

The perfect plan
Must have an alibi
And the perfect pawn
To spew the party line
Of the perfect falsehood
Spoke a thousand times
The perfect words
Cover the greatest crime

Hell is turning itself inside out
To lead its path up to meet us
And we deliberately take
A step, one foot closer to the grave

// The Emperor //

Come here
Closer...
Who do you
Who do you think you are?
Some kind of super star?
We'll see

Where do you?
Where do you think you are?
That shit won't get you far
With me

You're just so dashing
You marvel at the sound
Of your own voice, as you crash into the ground

You look so perfect, but everybody knows
They're petrified to say the emperor has no robes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
They're just so petrified that the emperor has no clothes
Just so you know
That's how it goes

You're bad
You're bad for my health
Because you make me sick
You prick

Don't you know?
Don't you know who I am?
You know I'd like your face
To kick

If your lips are moving I know you must be lying
You even suck the life out of dying

You look so perfect, but everybody knows
They're petrified to say the emperor has no robes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
They're just so petrified that the emperor has no clothes

​(Guitar solo - Kiko Loureiro)

​(Guitar solo - Dave Mustaine)

The house of cards are falling
Luck is running thin
Father forgive him, being a punk is not a sin

You look so perfect, but everybody knows
They're petrified to say the emperor has no robes
So bloody perfect, but everybody knows
They're just so petrified that the emperor has no clothes

You look so perfect, perfect
The emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, perfect
The emperor has no clothes
You look so perfect, perfect
The emperor has no clothes
So bloody perfect, perfect
And everybody knows
Except you

// Last Dying Wish //

Here it comes; this is finally your time
It's what you've been waiting for
All the blood, sweat, and tears getting ready
For this one moment, for this one shot

All eyes are focused on you
Everyone is now watching, waiting
It seems the world has stopped turning
The clock's spinning, and you better not blow it

This is the deciding factor
Your personal "come to Jesus" moment
Where they separate winners and losers
Ask yourself; do I really want this bad enough?

I've got to prove myself
I'll turn the night a' light
I'll set this place on fire
I know tonight's the night

There are millions of reasons you should give up
Each one just waiting for you to wash out
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity
Soldier on and drown out the sounds of defeat

The world is yours to take, abandon your "plan B"
Seize everything you've ever wanted
Because for those who think winning comes easy
Luck will be their last dying wish

I've got to prove myself
I'll turn the night a' light
I'll set this place on fire
I know tonight's the night

// Foreign Policy //

Eliminate the incompetents
Difference don't exist in harmony!
Survival is superiority!
We don't need no hands across the sea!

Establish the new order!
Suspect everyone!
Know your enemies!

We've got...

Weakness is disease!

// Me Hate You //

I know I should have seen the writings
That everything about you is fake
How could I be in such denial?
That all you wanna do is make me hate

You build me up so you can
Cut me down, if you're
Trying to make me hate you... it's working

You may believe this is
Gonna make me better, if you're
Trying to make me hate you... it's working

Each word you said my veins grew harder
I ignored the warnings in my face
My black heart is turning into stone
Cause all you wanna do is make me hate

You are the only thing you
Want to talk about, if you're
Trying to make me hate you... it's working

You disagree till I don't mind
And you don't matter, if you're
Trying to make me hate you... it's working

// Melt The Ice Away //

Melt the ice away, that's what they say
Say it, say it, say it's safe
Don't you breakdown under hailstone
Yeah, you can do what you want
You can be what you want
It's a bad, bad world
Yes, you know they can hurt
I'm the same as you, I need loving too

Cold winds are blowing
I think it's time I was going
Sad, sad city
When you're giving for a living
Yeah, you can have it with me
It's a perfect dream
You can be here too
There's a lot you can do
By the way you appear
In the eyes of the world
Take my word

You can see the sign coming from afar
You can see the sign coming from afar
Can you see it there?
Oh, oh, melt the ice away

When you're dashing, red lights flashing
Oh, you can burn out a wire, it's a crazy desire
You can go with the wind, you can be my friend
You don't need a hand, take the promised land

You can see the sign coming from afar
You can see the sign, oh yeah, it's there
Oh, oh, melt the ice away
Melt the ice away, yeah, melt the ice away
