// The Sick, The Dying... And The Dead! //

(Bring out your dead
Bring out your dead
Bring out your dead
Bring out your dead)

Invaders came on phantom ships
Sailed the Black Sea west to Sicily, yeah, yeah
The sick, the dying, and the dead
All that was left from this cursed disease, yeah, yeah

It was the fleas onboard that bit infected rats
Got blood inside of the fleas, yeah, yeah
Soon the ghost ships tied up to the docks
The path of the plague was complete, yeah, yeah

The sweet smell of rosies, a pocketful of posies
You can't mask the fragrance of death in their beds
There's typhus in the air, and ashes everywhere
Amongst the sick, the dying, and the dead

Feral creatures feasting on the dead
Devour rancid human meat, yeah, yeah
Death and sickness permeate their bones
Rich or poor, they're dragged through the streets, yeah, yeah

Open up your eyes, so you can see
All the sick, the dying, and the dead

Die, die, die!
Die, die, die!
Die, die, die!
Die, die, die!

The sick, the dying...
And the dead

// Life In Hell //

Busted, caught red-handed again
You can't be trusted, born to lose, you'll never win
You're so corrupted, you stand before us condemned
So maladjusted to-the-world we're living-and-dying-in

Spy versus spy, you will never have friends
You deny, the truth of where you've been
You get caught, and then the "blame-game" begins

A couple drinks and then you'll feel ok
A couple pills makes the world go away
What the hell, you're gonna die anyway and you'll say...

I'm a disease, and I'm addicted to myself
I'm all I need, I'm gonna live and die in Hell

No fingerprints, you erased you exist
Kill or be killed, how you get your kicks
Over, and over, you just couldn't resist

A couple drinks and then you'll feel ok
A couple pills makes the world go away
What the hell, you're gonna die anyway and you'll say...

I'm a disease, and I'm addicted to myself
I'm all I need, I'm gonna live and die in... Hell

Only a fool would do what you've done
You lie, you steal, and you cheat everyone
When you're caught in your most despicable deed
You plead the court for Diplomatic Immunity

You may be eloquent with your savoir faire
But each time the smoke clears, another body's there
You've had more than your share of good advice
There's nothing left to say, now except "Have a life"

Their faces haunt your dreams, each, and every night
When it gets too much, in your ring there's cyanide
Now everything fades out and you depart just like a ghost
The Devil says, "Welcome to Hell, I am your host"

There's no reason left to say goodbye!
There's no reason left to live or die
Judgment's waiting, it's the end of the line

Your existence and this twisted game
The definition of criminally insane
It won't be long until you do it again, you'll see!

I'm a disease (Life in Hell)
I'm all I need (Die in Hell)
I'm a disease (Life in Hell)
I'm all I need (Die in Hell)

I'm a disease (Life in Hell)
I'm all I need (Die in Hell)
I'm a disease (Life in Hell)
I'm all I need (Die in Hell)

// Night Stalkers //

Concealed in the night from the light of the moon
Undetected between the heavens, the stars, and the seas
They seize the night when it's dark, like inside a tomb
Faintly, their flat black body armor gleams, light it up!

From verdict, to deliverance, to retribution
To the very last beat of a dead man's pulse
You can hear the thunder roll, you can hear the engines roar
It causes the ground to quake, to buck and convulse

Lights out in the desert
Battle-born, ready to fight
Your death waits in the dark
And it stalks the night...
Night Stalkers

The angels of death ride the waves of the air
You barely see the pilots on this "zero-illum" night
The avenger's ready, now, as the target's growing near
Tracer bullets, shot from the ground, behind enemy lines

Blacked out, we're under radio silence
Night vision on, green halos a' glow
It's killing time, another lesson in violence
Bodies pile up, and adrenaline starts to flow

Lights out in the desert
Battle-born, ready to fight
Your death waits in the dark
And it stalks the night...
Night Stalkers

Yo! When you hear four MH-47 and Black Hawk helicopters coming in low
In the dark of night
Loaded with Rangers and Delta Force Special Ops shooters
Locked and loaded
Game's over, bitches!
Got ya in my night vision
'Bout to let this 30mm canon go
You never seen us coming
So there's no chance of running

Nothing you do can stop them
They're gonna get ya, wanted dead or alive
You can run, but you know they will find you
"Death waits in the dark," and they own the night

Lights out in the desert
Battle-born, ready to fight
Your death waits in the dark
And it stalks the night...
The night

Hydra rockets are all locked and loaded
Laser-guided Hellfire missiles are ready and armed
Itchy fingers on 30 mike-mike triggers
They enter the fight, with all their targets acquired

Flying in "formation" like a black snake
Slithering closely over the map of the earth
Slicing the silvery-blueish night fog to ribbons
The time has come to return dirt back to the dirt
Yeah!

// Dogs Of Chernobyl //

It was springtime
The minutes simply drifting away
Then everything stopped in the world

Fallout – radioactive clouds
Fallout – hides the exclusion zone
Fallout – and you were nowhere to be found

I see your face, wherever I turn
There's blood on my lips, as my eyes start to burn
You vanished and left me behind
Like one of the Dogs of Chernobyl, where did you go?

Nuclear winter is here
Reactor Four's still belching clouds
There's no one left to hear a sound

On and on – Fallout – on and on, I keep searching for you
But I know – Fallout – I know you're never coming back
Not for me – Fallout – not for me, or for anyone, anywhere, anyway

I see your face, wherever I turn
There's blood on my lips, as my eyes start to burn
You vanished and left me behind
Like one of the Dogs of Chernobyl, where did you go?

I see your face, wherever I turn
My hair's falling out, as my skin starts to burn
You vanished and left me behind
Like one of the Dogs of Chernobyl, where did you go?

Vault breach, too close is dead, massive exposure
I must escape and navigate this concrete enclosure
No warning, and no pain, only shock and then dread
No one coming, no one going, I'm alive with the dead

Nausea overwhelms my brain, distance is the goal
Stomach spasms, leaking gut, I have lost all control
Saliva gurgling, I'm retching, till I overwhelm the bowl
I ask God, in repentance, "Do you still want my soul?"

Bodies strewn everywhere, no need for cremation
Daylight coming into view, I sense there's no salvation
Stagger out into the open, my eyes fixed and staring
Armed patrol, red lights on, the sirens are a' blaring

I am the walking dead and I'm taken into safety
They ask the time of death because my skin's looking pasty
Transfusions, test tubes, and clinical eyeing
Purulence and decay, my deathly complying

Blankets of smoke, orifices bleed
Bloating bellies, and legs getting weak
Cerebral swelling, organs liquifying
Acute radiation, this is how they die
This is how they die
This is how they die

// Sacrifice //

Come listen to a tale of a tragic sacrifice
Of a warlock king of satanic ancestry
Being possessed by the worst-of-all human emotions
Burned at the stake for partaking in sorcery

The wickedest wizards barter the souls of the lost for the damned
Ooooh, spirits of the dead, for the wild and the free
Just beware if every thought has consequences
What they think is worse than any curse could be

The sky's, the sky's, on fire, flames rise, and shadows fall
Cremate, cremate, the king, sky-clad, and drenched in blood
Binding hexes, casting spells, the demons drink to you down in hell
When you promised not to break the oath you take...
The oath you make

Every charm and talisman can be broken
It must be unwound, and undone, if you wanna break free

The sky's, the sky's, on fire, flames rise, and shadows fall
Cremate, cremate, the king, sky-clad, and drenched in blood
Binding hexes, casting spells, the demons drink to you down in hell
When you promised not to break the oath you take...
The oath you take...
The oath you make

Binding hexes, casting spells, the demons drink to you down in hell
When you promised not to break the oath you take...
The oath you make

// Junkie //

Junkie, what you live for
Junkie, you junkie

Got a monkey on his back
A craving nobody knows about
Hopeless and dopeless, now that he's down and out

Sicker than a dog again
Suicidal, the smack ran out
He found a dealer playing Russian Roulette

The cure is worse than the disease
He's long past caring if he dies
He fills the needle, slams a shot, and then
Squeezing the trigger, he closes his eyes… fire!

Junkie, what you live for
Junkie, you'll gladly die for

A dope seeking missile
Scoring and shooting all through the night
Everyone knows that everyone runs 'outta-luck'
Night yields the sky to the morning
Time's up, he knew, so he said
"Get High or Die!" and then he was dead

The cure is worse than the disease
He's long past caring if he dies
He fills the needle, slams a shot, and then
Squeezing the trigger, he closes his eyes

Junkie, what you live for
Junkie, you'll gladly die for
Junkie, it's killing you
It's killing me, can't you see
Junkie
You junkie

Junkie
Junkie
J-j-junkie
J-j-j-j-j-j-junkie

// Psychopathy //

Psychopathy, like many psychiatric disorders and syndromes
Has environmental, as well as moderately strong genetic components
Findings indicate there are genetic influences
Accounting for all of the psychopathic dimensions
While environmental factors appear related to the disorder
The reciprocal nature between factors and expression
Of psychopathic traits is an important goal for future research

// Killing Time //

Some people look at you and feel sorry
They see your beady eyes and a soul that is black
It's clear to see, you're a pathological liar
And your alibi was a lie, it was all just an act
And that's a fact

When you start moving your lips, I know that you're lying
So, don't tell me you need me, you're killing my time
Stop saying you're grateful 'cause you're not, your kind is so hateful
I'll make sure I'm ready
I'll make sure that I'm ready to go!

If I told me once, I told me a thousand times
It's just a matter of time, you'll screw the world inside-out
You're a sick, psychopath, you squander everything, and then laugh
You've got to know what goes around comes around
And around!

When you start moving your lips, I know that you're lying
So, don't tell me you need me, you're killing my time
Stop saying you're grateful 'cause you're not, your kind is so hateful
I'll make sure I'm ready
I'll make sure that I'm ready to go!

When you start moving your lips, I know that you're lying
So, don't tell me you need me, you're killing my time
Stop saying you're grateful 'cause you're not, your kind is so hateful
I'll make sure I'm ready
I'll make sure
That I'm ready to go!

Start moving your lips, I know that you're lying
(I know that you're lying)
So, don't tell me you need me, you're killing my time
(You're killing my time)
Stop saying you're grateful 'cause you're not, your kind is so hateful
I'll make sure I'm ready (So hateful...)
I'll make sure that I'm ready to go!

So hateful
So hateful
Kill my time
So hateful
So hateful
So hateful
So hateful
So hateful
So hateful
Killing time

// Soldier On! //

No reason left for living, living all alone
And dying unforgiven, with unforgiven bones
Dead years, and the dread years, they were all throughout your life
The road was soon your mistress, and the stage became your wife

Marching off to war, everyone can see
They're paralyzed with fear, they get down on their knees and pray

Of all the battles won and lost, the lives and treasures that it cost
I know I've got to soldier on!
Watching mankind destroy itself, walk straight into the mouth of Hell
I know I've got to soldier on!

No reason left for dying, dying to be right
Days, living unforgiven, and unforgiven nights
Lean years, and the mean years, they were all throughout your life
Two steps forward and two steps back, you're out of time

Marching off to war, everyone can see
They're paralyzed with fear, they get down on their knees and pray

Of all the battles won and lost, the lives and treasures that it cost
I know I've got to soldier on!
Watching mankind destroy itself, walk straight into the mouth of Hell
I know I've got to soldier on!

Of all the battles won and lost, the lives and treasures that it cost
I know I've got to soldier on!
Watching mankind destroy itself, walk straight into the mouth of Hell
I know I've got to soldier on!

Marching off to war, everyone can see
They're paralyzed with fear, they get down on their knees and pray

Of all the battles won and lost, the lives and treasures that it cost

I know I've got to soldier on!

Of all the battles won and lost, the lives and treasures that it cost

// Célebutante //

You say you're a model, it's evident you've never met
A mirror you didn't love "Ooh-La-La!"
You say you're an angel with your halo, and your crown
As you fly up to the sun, and melt your wings

It's not a want, it's an obsession
You wanna hear the people screaming out your name
Whispers at night in your midnight confessions
You'll do anything for fame
Célebutante

Célebutante

You say you're an actor, well, then come set-up the stage
Put the cast right where you want; show us what you got!
You say you're in movies, always dropping names of
So-called-semi-almost-famous friends; it never ends

It's not a want, it's an obsession
You wanna hear the people screaming out your name
Whispers at night in your midnight confessions
You'll do anything for fame
Célebutante

Fame, to teach the unteachable
Fame, to reach the unreachable
Fame, to beat the unbeatable
Fame, to keep the unkeepable
Fame, the tighter you hold on to
Fame, the more everything slips away!

All the right hungers, all the right thirsts
All the right aches, the pains, and the hurts
All the right gossip, all the right trends
All the right knives in the backs of your friends

// Mission To Mars //

Countdown is commencing, pretty soon I'll be saying, "Goodbye Earth"
A rocket ride on a bucking bronc, at seventeen thousand miles an hour
It's only seven months to Mars, give or take a light year or two (Or three)
And I wanna, I wanna be an astronaut
I wanna, I wanna, wanna

Starting lift-off procedures...
All systems standing by – over –
OVER?!

Blast-off, I'm on my way, I'm a shooting star
A man on a mission
I hang with the man on the moon, I'll be there soon
A man on a mission to Mars

I headbang on the gangway, say my prayers, cross my heart and hope to die
Open a window for the Seven Sisters of Pleiades
"Hello ladies", "Hello Moon Man!"
Three hundred million miles to Mars, it doesn't seem so far away (Yes it does!)
And I wanna, I wanna be an astronaut
I wanna, I wanna, wanna

Starting landing procedures...
All systems standing by – over –
OVER?!

Blast-off, I'm on my way, I'm a shooting star
A man on a mission
I hang with the man on the moon, I'll be there soon
A man on a mission to Mars

Blast-off, I'm on my way, I'm a shooting star
A man on a mission
I hang with the man on the moon, I'll be there soon
I'm a man on a mission to Mars

// We'll Be Back //

The timing is right to exact my revenge
Spilling enemy blood, I will fight to the end
No more lying-in wait, just to even the score
There's a price to be paid, now it's time for war

I'm a soldier of fortune, of torture, and pain
I bash in your skull until no teeth remain
A 'most-deadly' weapon, pulverizing your head
With each crushing blow, how you wish you were dead

Just when you think it's safe, I attack
We'll be back
When you least expect your fate, I attack
We'll be back
A kick to your face, one move, big mistake
We'll be back
Let down your guard, full-on frontal attack
I'll be back!

No use screaming for mercy, no use makin' a sound
Still, you step right up, and get smacked back down
In the heat of battle, blood congeals on the floor
Another life-force bleeds out, another soul out the door

Antisocial, sadistic, the "Deity of War"
I stuff body bags, and I'm packing the morgue
No time for remorse over unclaimed remains
It's just flotsam and jetsam, and it's circling the drain

Just when you think it's safe, I attack
We'll be back
When you least expect your fate; I attack
We'll be back
A kick to your face, one move, big mistake
We'll be back
Let down your guard, full-on frontal attack
I'll be back!

// Police Truck //

Tonight's the night that we got the truck
We're going downtown, gonna beat up drunks
Your turn to drive, I'll bring the beer
It's the late, late shift, no one to fear
Ride, ride, how we ride
And ride, low ride

It's roundup time where the good whores meet
We're gonna drag one screaming off the street
And ride, ride, how we ride

Got a black uniform and a silver badge
Playing cops for real, playing cops for pay
Let's ride, low ride

Pull down your dress, here's a kick in the ass
Let's beat you blue, 'til you shit in your pants
Don't move child, I got a big black stick
There's six of us babe, so suck on my dick
And ride, ride, how we ride
Let's ride, low ride

The left newspapers might whine a bit
But the guys at the station, they don't give a shit
Dispatch calls, "Are ya doin' somethin' wicked?"
"No siree, Jack, we're just givin' tickets!"
Ride, ride, how we ride
And ride, ride, how we ride
And ride, ride, how we ride
Let's ride, low ride

// This Planet's On Fire (Burn In Hell) //

Canceled flights, limousines
Hustle, bustle, crazy scenes
First you're here, then you're there
Pretty soon, then you've been everywhere

Ooh, this planet's on fire
Ah, Satan's desire
We've seen the rise, we'll see the fall
He's here to see us all
Burn in Hell

Well, time ticks away, faster, faster
You run so fast; you forget what you're after
Make a deal to sell your soul
Just to find out, baby, it's been sold
"Ha!" you sucker! Hey?!

Ooh, this planet's on fire
Ah, Satan's desire
We've seen the rise, we'll see the fall
He's here to see us all
Burn in Hell
Burn in Hell

Ooh, this planet's on fire
Ah, Satan's desire
We've seen the rise, we'll see the fall
He's here to see us all
Burn in Hell

Fine, white lines of crystal light
Keep us up all day and all night
Yeah, we're just forgotten boys and girls
Who thrive on cosmic toys

Ooh, this planet's on fire
Ah, Satan's desire
We've seen the rise, we'll see the fall
He's here to see us all
Burn in Hell
Burn in Hell

This planet's on fire
This planet's on fire
Ooh, this planet's on fire
Ah, Satan's desire
Ooh, this planet's on fire
Ah, Satan's desire
