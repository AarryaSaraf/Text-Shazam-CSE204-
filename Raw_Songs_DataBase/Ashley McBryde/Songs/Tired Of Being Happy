God, it's good to see you, I just got in
We got a lot of catchin' up to do, how the hell you been?
Yeah I saw the pictures, the two of you all dressed up
I can't believe I'm gonna say this, you look so damn good in love

And if you ever get tired of bein' happy
You know I won't be hard to find at all
Baby you know you always had me
And if you ever get tired of bein' happy, give me a call

Now darlin', I ain't sayin' it won't all work out
It's just no one knows like I do, you can't settle for settlin' down
I guess I gotta own it, I'm the one that let you go
I ain't puttin' nothin' on ya, I just wanted you to know

If you ever get tired of bein' happy
Oh, I won't be hard to find at all
I've never wrecked a home, but don't put it past me
If you ever get tired of bein' happy, give me a call

If you ever get tired of bein' happy
You know I won't be hard to find at all
I've never wrecked a home, but don't put it past me
If you ever get tired of bein' happy, give me a call

If you ever get tired of bein' happy, give me a call
Oh, why don't ya give me a call
Yeah, just give me a call
