Left him at the terminal and slowly walked away
'Cause I don't think that I could stand to watch him board that plane
Goodbye shouldn't heart so bad, but in Memphis, Tennessee
It did while I watched him walk away from me

And tonight I'll be alone in my bed
Thoughts of how I miss you runnin' through my head
Tonight I'll be okay even though you're not around
'Cause it's the second night alone that breaks you down

I unlocked that door tonight knowing you're not there
For at least a couple hours, I'll act like I don't care
Just turned on the radio and they'll probably play our song
And I'll go on this evenin' actin' like there's nothin' wrong

And tonight I'll be alone in my bed
Thoughts of how I miss you runnin' through my head
Tonight I'll be okay even though you're not around
'Cause it's the second night alone that breaks you down

Couple more "I love you"s and one last goodbye kiss
So much about you that I love
So much I'm gonna miss

Tonight I'll be alone in my bed
Thoughts of how I miss you runnin' through my head
Tonight I'll be okay even though you're not around
'Cause it's the second night alone that breaks you down
It's tomorrow night alone
That's gonna break me down
