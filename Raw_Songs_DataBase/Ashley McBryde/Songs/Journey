A different zipcode, a different town
My whole life's turned upside down
I was so gone
Tried to wade through all that guilt
And I walked away but no one still
It was so wrong

And I waited outside
Hoping you would chase me out the door
When it finally hit me
I said just what am I waiting for and the

Wheels turn and miles headed up
And I forgave myself for saying I'd had enough
I wasted so much time
Over what we were gonna be
It's gonna take a while to get back to where I look
A little more like me
But it's all about the journey

A pack of Marlboro's and a coke
I didn't even know I smoke
I guess I'm starting
It makes me smile to think of you
And just how much you disapprove
And I spark one

That sign says it's the last of it's kind
To mile 202
That suits me fine cause
I don't plan on pulling over anytime soon oh the

Wheels turn and the miles are on my side
Got my sight set home with the road and the sunset collide
If I've known this and what I'd feel now
I would've never said I was sorry
I'm on my own cause truth been known
You never did deserve me
It's all about the journey
It's all about the journey
