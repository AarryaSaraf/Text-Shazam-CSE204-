Rows and rows of blacks and yellows in the tall grass
By a highway that don't see too many cars pass
Hills roll gently down by the church that saved my soul
It's just a mile from the only home I've ever known

My first kiss was in that old tin barn
That old hayloft helped me break my arm
I can't remember if I cried at all
I miss you Arkansas

There ain't no sidewalks up on Highway 24
There ain't no stop lights because there ain't much worth stopping for
That old swing was out on Papa's porch
And it's been gone now for years of course
There's nothing like it in the fall
I miss you Arkansas

I know it's rare I know what I had
'Cuz that barbed wire garden made me most of who I am

This concrete empire outside my window frame tonight
Can't hold a bonfire like an Ozark mountain campsite
Lots of Broadway they call me out
I came out here to make you proud
I know you'll catch me if I fall
I miss you Arkansas

I miss you Arkansas
I miss you
