Jesus Jenny
What the hell's gotten into you
Girl you've got a lot to lose
In the morning you've got work to do
Jesus Jenny
God damnit its Monday night
You're fucked up on vodka and sprite
Can't even cuss me right

I ain't saying I'm a saint
But I'm living proof a heart can change
And honey I ain't judging
But I can just say nothing
All I can do for you right now is pray
To Jesus Jenny

Titties popping out your turtleneck
You're riding around in your red corvette
Getting all the wrong kinds of respect
Jesus Jenny
Shit I wouldn't want your man to see
The way you keep looking at me
Don't do him like you did me
Jesus Jenny

I ain't saying I'm a saint
But I'm living proof a heart can change
And honey I ain't judging
But I can just say nothing
All I can do for you right now is pray
That your demons go away
That you get home ok
I ain't saying
I'm just saying
Jesus Jenny
Jenny you're drunk
Jenny go home
Blah blah blah blah
