Velvet red
Velvet red
He'd come callin'
Velvet red

There was a narrow road to that old foot path
Where the briar tangles into the muscadine
That old, abandoned cabin
Was the perfect place for forbidden love to hide

She was the mayor's eldest daughter
She had a taste for the fruit of the vine
And he was a poor boy down in that holler
Who made his living on his homemade wine

Velvet red
Velvet red
He'd come callin'
Velvet red
Velvet red
Velvet red
She'd come runnin'
Velvet red

Don't you know their love grew, like the wild flowers do?
She'd start to miss him with an awful thirst
And when that sun went down, she'd go sneakin' out
And he'd be waitin', callin' out to her

Velvet red
Velvet red
Makin' love on
Velvet red
Velvet red
Velvet red
They were drunk on
Velvet red

There was a child born twenty years ago
To a mother who never wed
Though she gave no name for the father
She called her daughter little velvet red

Velvet red
Velvet red
Mama calls me
Velvet red
Velvet red
Velvet red
My mama calls me
Velvet red
