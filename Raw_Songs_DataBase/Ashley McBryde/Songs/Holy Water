Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind but now I see

Father, Father, hear my confession
I ain't had a prayer, for what's been years
Mary, I ain't seen her face, said her name, felt her grace
That's how I wound at your place sitting right here

Got my head now, I gotta get it all out
Lord, there's just something about breaking all the rules
But I can't resist a real good time
Swear I'm not the cheating kind
But once again I find myself with nothing left to lose

I need salvation in a bottle
Sweet redemption in a glass
I need your 90 proof forgiveness
So pour a double make it fast
Have Mary turn the jukebox up
This old girl just had enough
And I'm waiting here at the alter for that holy water

Just keep em coming
I don't want to feel nothing
Unless you got something
To change my ways
Because I'm the patron saint of bad good byes
Heartbreak proof and 12 feet high
Don't bother saving me tonight
It's too late

I've got salvation in a bottle
Sweet redemption in a glass
I need your 90 proof forgiveness
So pour another make it fast
Have Mary turn the jukebox up
This old girl just had enough
And I'm waiting here at the alter for that holy water

Salvation in a bottle
Sweet redemption in a glass
I need your 90 proof forgiveness
Pour me a double make it fast
Have Mary turn the jukebox up
This old girl just had enough
And I'm waiting here at the alter for that holy water
For that holy water
