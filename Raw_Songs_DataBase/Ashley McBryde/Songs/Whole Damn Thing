I'm at the end of a six day bender
Trying to see who's the big pretender here
Trying to see this thing from some place besides anger
I saw you in the arms of a stranger

I've been watching you so quietly
Let you think you could slide it right by me
Such a clever little thing with her glasses in her hair
Smiling oh so sweetly so I might forget that she was there

Exchanging glances that you thought I'd miss
Like I don't know it's her you're feeling on my lips
It's too late for you to try and come clean
I just want you to know I saw the whole damn thing

I can pretend everything's ok
Sure has been touch and go with us these days
One more night spent making a fool out of me
Got me thinking you ain't worth my sanity
Reaching out for just a glimpse of a dream we used to share
When I look into your eyes darling you're not even there

Exchanging glances that you thought I'd miss
Like I don't know it's her you're feeling on my lips
I'd love to tell myself it was all a bad dream
I've gotta let you go before you wreck the whole damn thing

Tell me now you never felt her touch
Tell me everything I gave you was more than enough
If you can Look into my eyes and make me believe
And I'll let it be but damn it all I see is you...

Exchanging glances that you thought I'd miss
Like I don't know its her you're feeling on my lips
Its too late for us so I wont make a scene
I just want you to know you can forget the whole damn thing
Just forget the whole damn thing
