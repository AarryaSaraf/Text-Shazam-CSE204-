Pete chalks the ballfields down at Dennis Linde park
Turns the sprinklers on at sun-up and the lights on after dark
If you got time to talk, he'll give you his two cents
The grass is always greener on his side of the fence
Yeah

He lost his wife to cancer and a thumb in Vietnam
Jokes he used to be a hitchhiker but not for very long
He runs off the gophers in a golf cart full of dents
And the grass is always greener cause he makes sure it is
Yeah

Says you're old as you feel, and I feel 35
And any day you wake up's a damn good day to be alive
Soak it in when you win 'cause you can't win 'em all
Go to church, love your mama
And play ball

I broke into concessions once, but he didn't call the cops
He just made me clean the grease traps and replace the bubble pops
That's the spring that daddy left, he knew I was actin' out
And when I hit my first homerun, he took me to Golden Corral
Yeah

Says you're old as you feel, and I feel 35
And any day you wake up's a damn good day to be alive
Soak it in when you win 'cause you can't win 'em all
Go to church, love your mama
And play ball

Someone to put the time in or fill an empty seat
The world would be a better place if we all had a Pete
