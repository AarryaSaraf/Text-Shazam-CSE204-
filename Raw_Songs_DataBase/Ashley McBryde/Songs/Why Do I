I started up with nothing
Still got most of it left
Almost enough to convince myself
I've been doing my best

I got so much potential
But I sit on my hands
And I cross every line
Just to proof that I can

Going broke, saving money
Laugh all you want to, but baby it ain't funny
I know you mean well I don't know why it hurts
I stand out in the rain dying of thirst

Oh why, why do I beg you to love me
When I know I can't win
Why do I beg you to stay
When I won't let you in

Well I got no good excuse
Hmmm then I give you one or two
It was always from the start
I'd have already sever all the ties to my heart

I am begging on my boots to fall to my feet
Oh I walk through the fire but I can't stand the heat

Oh why, why do I beg you to love me
When I know I can't win
Why do I beg you to stay
When I won't let you in

Oh you're damned if you do and damned if you don't
Cause I can't let you love me and I won't let you go

Oh why, why do I beg you to love me
When I know I can't win
Why do I beg you to stay
When I won't let you
Why do I beg you to love me
When I can't let you oh
Can you tell me why I beg you to stay
When I won't let you in
I won't let you in
Oh yeah
