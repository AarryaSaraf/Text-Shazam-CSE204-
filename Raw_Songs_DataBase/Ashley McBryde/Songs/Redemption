I write songs that feel good, I write songs that hurt
I've been known to turn a honky tonk into a black baptist church
Amen

I know sin by his first name, I know salvation well
You can say I saw the light in the flickerin' flames of hell

I got a bottle of redemption on my shelf
Child let me help you save yourself
Good God almighty, we're glory bound
And there's plenty of redemption to go around

I don't call myself a prophet, I can't say that I'm a saint
But I've been down to the crossroads, I've seen things that must folks ain't
And I know the devil can't do much evil, if he's too damn drunk to stand
My angels got they hands full, I help the only way I can

I got a bottle of redemption on my shelf
Child let me help you save yourself
Good God almighty, we're glory bound
And there's plenty of redemption to go around

Whether it's a one room tavern bar stool, or a little white church house pew
I find the faith, I fight the way, my Jesus wants me to
Me & God are good, despite all the wicked things I've done
If He'll save this back-slidin' bastard, then brother believe He'll save anyone

I got a bottle of redemption on my shelf
Child let me help you save yourself
Good God almighty, we're glory bound
And there's plenty of redemption

I got a bottle of redemption on my shelf
And I can't drink it all by myself
Bow your head, fold your hands
Gonna drink all the way to Glory Land
I got a bottle of redemption
