Shut up Sheila
Can't you see we're all talking?
Why don't you and Jesus take a walk down the hallway?
Shut up Sheila
It's already so loud from these damn machines
Can't my mama's mama just die in peace?
Shut up Sheila

We don't sing Amazing Grace
We don't read from the Bible
We just go about lettin' go
In our own way
We drink and we get high
We laugh at the wrong time
We don't cry
And we don't pray
Oh, we don't cry
We don't pray

Shut up Sheila
This here is a family thing
And ain't nobody bought you a ring
Shut up Sheila
I don't remember askin' you
And if we wanna throw the ashes off a goddamned roof
Then we're goin' to

We don't sing Amazing Grace
We don't read from the Bible
We just go about lettin' go
In our own way

We don't sing Amazing Grace
We don't read from the Bible
We just go about lettin' go
In our own way
We drink and we get high
We laugh at the wrong time
We don't cry
And we don't pray
Oh, we don't cry
We don't pray

We don't sing Amazing Grace
We don't read from the Bible
We just go about lettin' go
In our own way
