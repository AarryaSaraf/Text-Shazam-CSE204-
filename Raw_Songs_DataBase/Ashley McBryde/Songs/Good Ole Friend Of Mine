I'm a dreamer and a writer
A lover and a liar
And I've been accused of wasting' too much time
And I'm just glad I'm breathin'
I'm barely breaking even
Just gettin' by is a good ole friend of mine

There ain't a thing I don't know
About flyin' solo
And I've been known to disappear from time to time
There ain't nothing I can't outrun
With my guitar riddin' shotgun
And this lonely road, it's a good ole friend of mine

Oh, up all night tries to take its toll on me
Seem like Sunday mornin' and Saturday night don't always agree
And that's alright, I'm in good company

Well I'm the one that you get close to
Even though you ain't supposed to
Ain't no way in hell I can walk a line
'Cause I'm the last sip of whiskey
Ah, you know you're gonna miss me
'Cause this moving on, it's a good ole friend of mine

It's a good ole friend of mine
It's a good ole friend of mine
It's a good ole friend of mine
