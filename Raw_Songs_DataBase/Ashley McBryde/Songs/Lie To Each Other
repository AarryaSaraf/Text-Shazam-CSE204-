It's best to get this situation out on the table
We've both been around enough to know desperate when it walks in the room
So you're not the one who's gonna turn it all around
And I can only help you to get a little more upside down
We just call this what it is before it gets to my head
Oh, no nevermind, can we just lie to each other instead

I know that chances are I wake up and hate both of us tomorrow
You know that loving me could never last beyond these walls
So don't waste my time with the small talk and the games
Give me my distraction, we both know it's why we came
If we can't have the one we want, we'll just take we can get
Oh, just listen to me, baby, let's lie to each other instead

Cause as far as I'm concerned
It already hurts to breathe
So how much harm could it do
To be exactly what you need

They'll let you know that I'm a heartache carousel
Look em in the eye and tell em it takes one to tell
They can give us both advice, but after everything said
Oh baby, you and me, we're gonna lie to each other instead
Oh baby, you and me, we're gonna lie to each other instead
