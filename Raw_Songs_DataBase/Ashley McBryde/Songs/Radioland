We had one country station
You could drive and listen
All the way to Water Town
Mama kept oldies
Playing in the kitchen
Turned up just a little too loud
Daddy was a rockstar
Riding on a tractor
Listening to Townes Van Zandt
I was 5 years old
With a hairbrush microphone
Growing up in Radioland

Whoa, Radioland
Just the other side
Of a dashboard light
There ain't a dream
You can't dial in
Radioland, Radioland
Radioland
Yeah!

Catch a Friday night game
Or a Sunday sermon
In the cab of a Chevrolet
Casey Kasem and an old Panasonic
Counting down my Saturday
Mix tape Valentine
Love cuts like a knife
I wanna hold your hand
Well I got my first kiss
I got to first base
All thanks to Radioland

Whoa, Radioland
Just the other side
Of a dashboard light
There ain't a dream
You can't dial in
Radioland, Radioland
Radioland

Buy a guitar
Learn a couple songs
Find some buddies
And start a band
Get on a bus
Try your luck
Out here in Radioland

Radioland, Radioland
Radioland, Radio- Johnny and June
Radioland, Radioland
Radioland, Radio- Jack and Diane
Radioland, Radioland
Radio, radio

There ain't a dream
You can't dial in
Out here in Radioland

Radio... Radioland
Radio...
