// Break It Fast //

Strong and wild like a Carolina summer wind
You come going in and out of my life again
And I drop what I'm doing every time you come around
Only hear you knocking bout the time I decide to stick around
Its not healthy my friends tell me all the time
I gotta lose your number and find someone and make em mine
I hate to say it but its hard to disagree
Cause you'll only hold me long enough to leave a mark on me
Won't you leave me baby let me watch you walk away
Cause believe me baby it may be what its gonna to take
I'm not the first and I've got a feeling I ain't the last
So I need you to break my heart, aw baby break it fast
Oh...

Lost and lonely you leave me somewhere in the night
And if you ever loved me then Love me enough to twist the knife
I miss every broken minute and the heartache of it is
I'll still walk right off the edge to taste the poison on your lips
Won't you leave me baby, let me watch you walk away
Cause believe me baby, it may be what its gonna to take
I'm not the first and I've got a feeling I ain't the last
So I need you to break my heart, aw baby break it fast
Oh...

Won't you leave me baby, let me watch you walk away
Won't you leave me baby, let me watch you walk away
Won't you leave me baby, just let me watch you
Won't you leave me baby, and let me watch you walk away
Oh...
Let me watch you
Let me watch you
Let me watch you, walk away
Oh...

Why won't you
Why won't you, walk

// Arkansas //

Rows and rows of blacks and yellows in the tall grass
By a highway that don't see too many cars pass
Hills roll gently down by the church that saved my soul
It's just a mile from the only home I've ever known

My first kiss was in that old tin barn
That old hayloft helped me break my arm
I can't remember if I cried at all
I miss you Arkansas

There ain't no sidewalks up on Highway 24
There ain't no stop lights because there ain't much worth stopping for
That old swing was out on Papa's porch
And it's been gone now for years of course
There's nothing like it in the fall
I miss you Arkansas

I know it's rare I know what I had
'Cuz that barbed wire garden made me most of who I am

This concrete empire outside my window frame tonight
Can't hold a bonfire like an Ozark mountain campsite
Lots of Broadway they call me out
I came out here to make you proud
I know you'll catch me if I fall
I miss you Arkansas

I miss you Arkansas
I miss you

// Journey //

A different zipcode, a different town
My whole life's turned upside down
I was so gone
Tried to wade through all that guilt
And I walked away but no one still
It was so wrong

And I waited outside
Hoping you would chase me out the door
When it finally hit me
I said just what am I waiting for and the

Wheels turn and miles headed up
And I forgave myself for saying I'd had enough
I wasted so much time
Over what we were gonna be
It's gonna take a while to get back to where I look
A little more like me
But it's all about the journey

A pack of Marlboro's and a coke
I didn't even know I smoke
I guess I'm starting
It makes me smile to think of you
And just how much you disapprove
And I spark one

That sign says it's the last of it's kind
To mile 202
That suits me fine cause
I don't plan on pulling over anytime soon oh the

Wheels turn and the miles are on my side
Got my sight set home with the road and the sunset collide
If I've known this and what I'd feel now
I would've never said I was sorry
I'm on my own cause truth been known
You never did deserve me
It's all about the journey
It's all about the journey

// Why Do I //

I started up with nothing
Still got most of it left
Almost enough to convince myself
I've been doing my best

I got so much potential
But I sit on my hands
And I cross every line
Just to proof that I can

Going broke, saving money
Laugh all you want to, but baby it ain't funny
I know you mean well I don't know why it hurts
I stand out in the rain dying of thirst

Oh why, why do I beg you to love me
When I know I can't win
Why do I beg you to stay
When I won't let you in

Well I got no good excuse
Hmmm then I give you one or two
It was always from the start
I'd have already sever all the ties to my heart

I am begging on my boots to fall to my feet
Oh I walk through the fire but I can't stand the heat

Oh why, why do I beg you to love me
When I know I can't win
Why do I beg you to stay
When I won't let you in

Oh you're damned if you do and damned if you don't
Cause I can't let you love me and I won't let you go

Oh why, why do I beg you to love me
When I know I can't win
Why do I beg you to stay
When I won't let you
Why do I beg you to love me
When I can't let you oh
Can you tell me why I beg you to stay
When I won't let you in
I won't let you in
Oh yeah

// Some Things //

That charming little street caf√©
Doesn't haunt me anymore
I can sit down in a corner booth
Without starring at the door
Running into our old friends
It doesn't happen much but it's nice when I do
They know they don't have to leave
Your name out for me
Like they used to

The smell inside my sixty-eight
Thank God it finally passed
I don't see you sitting next to me
Drawing hearts there on the glass
I've got so much going on
I hardly find the time to do what I need to do
I finally put those memories all to bed
And that having been said
There's still a few

There's a few mornings when I know
That the bitter winter cold
Has got you wishing your old bones weren't so used
An old song can take me back
Honey I can't help but laugh at how we danced
To Born To Run in the living room
I spent a lot of time
Erasing your life from mine
In the end it was the best thing I could do
But it don't mean
That some things don't remind me of you

I've been drinking coffee black again
Without that feeling in my throat
I don't see you on the movie screens
Or hear you in my radio
I know it took a little longer than
Either of us planned but that's just how it goes
I had to finish up with hating you and now that I'm through
What do you know

There's a few mornings when I know
That the bitter winter cold
Has got you wishing your old bones weren't so used
An old song can take me back
Honey I can't help but laugh at how we danced
To Born To Run in the living room
I spent a lot of time
Erasing your life from mine
After all you were the only thing I knew
So it don't mean
That some things don't remind me of you

No it don't mean
That some things don't remind me of you

// Lie To Each Other //

It's best to get this situation out on the table
We've both been around enough to know desperate when it walks in the room
So you're not the one who's gonna turn it all around
And I can only help you to get a little more upside down
We just call this what it is before it gets to my head
Oh, no nevermind, can we just lie to each other instead

I know that chances are I wake up and hate both of us tomorrow
You know that loving me could never last beyond these walls
So don't waste my time with the small talk and the games
Give me my distraction, we both know it's why we came
If we can't have the one we want, we'll just take we can get
Oh, just listen to me, baby, let's lie to each other instead

Cause as far as I'm concerned
It already hurts to breathe
So how much harm could it do
To be exactly what you need

They'll let you know that I'm a heartache carousel
Look em in the eye and tell em it takes one to tell
They can give us both advice, but after everything said
Oh baby, you and me, we're gonna lie to each other instead
Oh baby, you and me, we're gonna lie to each other instead

// Marlboro Man //

I remember thinking the Marlboro Man could be the man of my dreams
His dirty boots strung all across my living room
A real life hero should come and rescue me
From a tin roof in a one horse town where I couldn't tell if anything else existed
I was trapped and he got out of every scrap that he got into
And I was over here missing it

You wouldn't believe all the things I told, I told myself
It seemed like the only way to cope, but it never really helped

And all these bars are full of strangers lives
Like they came right out of a song
And I've let a few put their boots beneath my bed
I never let em' stay there long
Just when nights are kinda cold and I don't know that I can handle feeling like that again
So I reach for the comfort of someone so unfamiliar across my skin

You wouldn't believe all the things I did to myself
Just searching for something I couldn't resist, it never really helped

Show me a tall dark stranger and I, I show you a liar
Hand me the world on a string and I, I'll set it on fire

You wouldn't believe all the things I saw behind those curtains
You wouldn't believe all the things I drank to keep it from hurting
You wouldn't believe all the hearts I left broken and scattered
You wouldn't believe the price you'll pay for happy ever after
You wouldn't believe all the things I told myself, I saw myself, I showed myself, mmm...

I just remember thinking the Marlboro Man could be the man of my dreams

// Holy Water //

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind but now I see

Father, Father, hear my confession
I ain't had a prayer, for what's been years
Mary, I ain't seen her face, said her name, felt her grace
That's how I wound at your place sitting right here

Got my head now, I gotta get it all out
Lord, there's just something about breaking all the rules
But I can't resist a real good time
Swear I'm not the cheating kind
But once again I find myself with nothing left to lose

I need salvation in a bottle
Sweet redemption in a glass
I need your 90 proof forgiveness
So pour a double make it fast
Have Mary turn the jukebox up
This old girl just had enough
And I'm waiting here at the alter for that holy water

Just keep em coming
I don't want to feel nothing
Unless you got something
To change my ways
Because I'm the patron saint of bad good byes
Heartbreak proof and 12 feet high
Don't bother saving me tonight
It's too late

I've got salvation in a bottle
Sweet redemption in a glass
I need your 90 proof forgiveness
So pour another make it fast
Have Mary turn the jukebox up
This old girl just had enough
And I'm waiting here at the alter for that holy water

Salvation in a bottle
Sweet redemption in a glass
I need your 90 proof forgiveness
Pour me a double make it fast
Have Mary turn the jukebox up
This old girl just had enough
And I'm waiting here at the alter for that holy water
For that holy water

// Whole Damn Thing //

I'm at the end of a six day bender
Trying to see who's the big pretender here
Trying to see this thing from some place besides anger
I saw you in the arms of a stranger

I've been watching you so quietly
Let you think you could slide it right by me
Such a clever little thing with her glasses in her hair
Smiling oh so sweetly so I might forget that she was there

Exchanging glances that you thought I'd miss
Like I don't know it's her you're feeling on my lips
It's too late for you to try and come clean
I just want you to know I saw the whole damn thing

I can pretend everything's ok
Sure has been touch and go with us these days
One more night spent making a fool out of me
Got me thinking you ain't worth my sanity
Reaching out for just a glimpse of a dream we used to share
When I look into your eyes darling you're not even there

Exchanging glances that you thought I'd miss
Like I don't know it's her you're feeling on my lips
I'd love to tell myself it was all a bad dream
I've gotta let you go before you wreck the whole damn thing

Tell me now you never felt her touch
Tell me everything I gave you was more than enough
If you can Look into my eyes and make me believe
And I'll let it be but damn it all I see is you...

Exchanging glances that you thought I'd miss
Like I don't know its her you're feeling on my lips
Its too late for us so I wont make a scene
I just want you to know you can forget the whole damn thing
Just forget the whole damn thing

// Little Tragedy //

We were alone
In a crowd of a thousand
Standing under a giant Ferris wheel
You covered my shoulders
Breeze off the ocean
December on the Santa Monica Pier
You were there

We were at home
Dinner was over
The one I love was anxious for a kiss
I know I shouldn't
Most times I wouldn't
But I offered my cheek
A swing and a miss
You were there

Why can't you just turn me loose
Whatever's inside of you
And find some other tortured port of call
Cause I can count em one by one
Moments I've been absent from
Cause I can't get me rid of you at all

Dark quiet hours
Moon through a window
A hand on my shoulder
Face the wall
I gotta shake it
I know he's aching
And I'm just praying soon sleep will fall

Red wine and roses
Dancing and laughing
It's good to see us smiling once again
I got it handled
Once and for always
Preacher asked me if I do
And then you were there

Why can't you just turn me loose
Whatever's inside of you
And find some other tortured port of call
Favorite little tragedy
Ever present history
No, I can't get me rid of you at all
No, I can't get me rid of you at all

// Good Ole Friend Of Mine //

I'm a dreamer and a writer
A lover and a liar
And I've been accused of wasting' too much time
And I'm just glad I'm breathin'
I'm barely breaking even
Just gettin' by is a good ole friend of mine

There ain't a thing I don't know
About flyin' solo
And I've been known to disappear from time to time
There ain't nothing I can't outrun
With my guitar riddin' shotgun
And this lonely road, it's a good ole friend of mine

Oh, up all night tries to take its toll on me
Seem like Sunday mornin' and Saturday night don't always agree
And that's alright, I'm in good company

Well I'm the one that you get close to
Even though you ain't supposed to
Ain't no way in hell I can walk a line
'Cause I'm the last sip of whiskey
Ah, you know you're gonna miss me
'Cause this moving on, it's a good ole friend of mine

It's a good ole friend of mine
It's a good ole friend of mine
It's a good ole friend of mine
