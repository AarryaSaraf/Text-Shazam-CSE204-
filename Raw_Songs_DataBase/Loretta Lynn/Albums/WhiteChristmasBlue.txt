// Country Christmas //

Mommie pop the popcorn and we string it on the tree
Apples nuts and candy oh what a Christmas feel
Daddy play the organ and we'll all sing Silent Night
We'll have a good old country Christmas alright
A good old country Christmas that's what it's gonna be
With all the family gathered round our pretty Christmas tree
We'll open up our presents Christmas Eve about midnight
We'll have a good old country Christmas alright
[ guitar ]
Aunt Annie Belle will be here uncle Bill and darn our kids
We'll make ballets on the floor just like we always did
Gradnama bake the pies and cakes oh what a pretty sight
We'll have a good old country Christmas alright
A good old country Christmas...
A good old country Christmas...

// Away In A Manger //

Away in a manger no crib for a bed the little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where he lay the little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay
[ vibes ]
The cattle are lowing the baby awakes but little Lord Jesus no crying he makes
I love our Lord Jesus look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh
[ vibes ]
Away in a manger no crib for a bed...

// Blue Christmas //

I'll have a blue Christmas without you I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing dear if you're not here with me
I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain
And when those blue heartaches start hurtin'
You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue blue Christmas
[ piano ]
And when those blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue heartaches start calling
You'll be doing all right...

// To Heck With Ole Santa Claus //

(To heck with ole Santa Claus)
Last year I hung and stopped by the chimney and ole Santa didn't bring me anything
Well I wrote a note and I told him what to bring me
But I didn't even hear his sleigh bells ring
So to heck with ole Santa Clause
When he goes dashin' through the snow I hope he falls
I like to hear him any (ho ho ho) with a bunch of big snowballs
To heck with ole Santa Claus
[ guitar ]
Last year I built a big fire by the fireplace I'll be like a little bit I read about
If that big bad wolf in red comes down my chimney
He's a gonna scorch his whiskers there's no doubt
So to heck with ole Santa Clause...
Yeah to heck with ole Santa Claus

// White Christmas //

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen to hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas with every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright and may all your Christmases be white
[ mandolin ]
May your days be merry and bright and may all your Christmases be white

// Frosty The Snowman //

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that old silk that they found
For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me
[ guitar ]
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun before I melt away
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop
Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry I'll be back again some day
