Album: WouldntItBeGreat

// Darkest Day //

Darlin' when you told me you were leavin'
I thought that you were only foolin' me
But here I am to face old blue tomorrow
With a broken heart that's filled with misery

It seems that my world is through an end
Just dreamin' of things that might have been
Oh why I don't get all sunshine bright
Today's the darkest day of my life

Oh how I wish that old scene is through
It's always darkest just before dawn
Then I'll know soon I'm gonna face tomorrow
I just can't take this darkness on and on

It seems that my world is through an end
Just dreamin' of things that might have been
Oh why I don't get all sunshine bright
Today's the darkest day of my life

// My Angel Mother //

I'm writing this song about a girl that I know
She's just as pure as all silver and gold
I might search this world over but I couldn't find
No one to take the place of this mother of mine

Mother that's the sweetest name of them all
You're an angel on earth and to me you are worth
More than anything else in this world

I love you more day by day and I can never repay
All the things that you've done for me
Your heart is filled with joyous times
And your eyes oh how they shine
That's the story of this mother of mine

Mother that's the sweetest name of them all
You're an angel on earth and to me you are worth
More than anything else in this world

Mother
