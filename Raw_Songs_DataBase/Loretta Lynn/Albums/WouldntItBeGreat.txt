Album: WouldntItBeGreat

// Darkest Day //

Darlin' when you told me you were leavin'
I thought that you were only foolin' me
But here I am to face old blue tomorrow
With a broken heart that's filled with misery

It seems that my world is through an end
Just dreamin' of things that might have been
Oh why I don't get all sunshine bright
Today's the darkest day of my life

Oh how I wish that old scene is through
It's always darkest just before dawn
Then I'll know soon I'm gonna face tomorrow
I just can't take this darkness on and on

It seems that my world is through an end
Just dreamin' of things that might have been
Oh why I don't get all sunshine bright
Today's the darkest day of my life
