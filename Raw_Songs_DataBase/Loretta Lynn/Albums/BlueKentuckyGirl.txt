Album: BlueKentuckyGirl

// Blue Kentucky Girl //

You left me for the bright lights of the town a country boy set out to see the world
Remember when those city lights shine down
That big old moon shines on your Kentucky girl

I swear I love you by the moon above you how bright is it shinin' in your world
Some morning when you wake up all alone
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl

[banjo]

Don't wait to bring great riches home to me I need no diamond rings or fancy pearls
Just bring yourself you're all I'll ever need
That's good enough for this blue Kentucky girl

I swear I love you by the moon above you how bright is it shinin' in your world
Some morning when you wake up all alone
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl

// Then And Only Then //

In your haste you left and said you'd be returnin'
In my sorrow I forgot to ask you when
In my lonely room I sit and count the hours
Every minute hopin' I'll look up and you'll come walkin' in
For then and only then will I stop cryin'
And this aching breaking heart of mine will mend
Not until I feel your arms around me will I be happy and I live for then and only then
[ steel ]
All that's left inside my heart is just your echo
And the tiny thread of hope to which I cling
But if I keep holding on maybe some day
You'll remember where you left me and come back for me again
For then and only then...

// I Still Miss Someone //

At my door the leaves are falling a cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together and I still miss someone
I never got over those blue eyes I see them everywehere
I miss those arms that held me when all the love was there
I wonder if he's sorry for leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere and I still miss someone
There's someone for me somewhere and I still miss someone

// Night Girl //

You say you'd like to be with me tonight someplace where we can hide from your world
But if you're ashamed to show me up in daylight
Then I can't see why I should be your night girl
I guess you think I'll be your poor girl price who'll never fit into your social world
But if you're too good for me in your own eyes
Then I can't see why I should be your night girl
You were born into a wealthy family I was born into a world of poverty
So if you're too proud to have me in your world
Then I can't see why I should be your night girl
[ piano - guitar ]
You were born into a wealthy family...

// Love's Been Here And Gone //

Love's been here and gone but the mem'ry keeps holding on
Now I know how I'd be if I can leave through this love's been here and gone
When there's love your heart is strong but it weakens when love goes wrong
Now I've known that power dealt the parting hour love's been here and gone
I've loved once but never again a closed heart just won't let love in
Hopin' only to you oh what can I do love's been here and gone
[ piano ]
I've loved once but never again...

// Farther To Go //

I've been up to the top of a heartbreak mountain
I've been down in the valley of the blues
I've been down the road of loneliness and back again
And I've got farther to go than I've been
I've been down in the dust of broken mem'ries
I've been up on the clouds of happiness
I've seen many a glass held high in the house of sin
And I've got farther to go than I've been
I've got farther to go I've got things to forget
I've got things I remember about you
I've been up when you told me that you love me
I went down when you told me we were through
Cried until my eyes would dry then I cried again
And I've got farther to go than I've been yes I've got farther to go than I've been

// Race Is On //

Well I feel tears wellin' up cold and deep inside like my heart's sprung a big break
And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful that I may never shake
Now you might say that I was takin' it hard that he wrote me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow when I may break right down and bawl
Now the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are going to the inside
My tears are holdin' back they're tryin' not to fall
My heart's out of the runnin' true love scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches and the winner loses all
[ guitar - steel ]
One day I ventured in love never once suspectin' what the final result would be
How I lived in fear of waking up each morning and findin' that you're gone from me
Cause there's ache and pain in my heart for today was the one that I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win him and I came out in second place
Now the race is on...

// I Won't Forget You //

I know that I won't forget you for I've loved you too much for too long
Though you don't want me now I'll still love you till the breath in my body is gone
That's how it is with me and you'll always be the only love I ever knew
I'll forget many things in my lifetime but darling I won't forget you
[ guitar ]
That's how it is with me...

// Two Steps Forward //

Well here you come and I know what I'm gonna say
My mind's made up and I'm a leavin' you today
Well I'm tired of askin' you where you've been I'm tired of all this mis'ry I'm in
Two steps forward and six steps back again
Well my clothes're packed and I'm a headin' for the door
Don't look for me back cause I won't be back no more
Well I may think of you now and then
But don't hold your breath cause I don't know when
Two steps forward and six steps back again
Two steps forward and six steps back you think I didn't want to go
These tears in my eyes they're not so real I'm just cuttin' on a show
I'm leavin' this town and that's for certain
Not much I ain't a cryin' not much I ain't a hurtin'
Two steps forward and six steps back again
[ ac.guitar + steel ]
Two steps forward and six steps back...
Yeah two steps forward and six steps back again

// Send Me The Pillow That You Dream On //

Send me the pillow that you dream on don't you know that I still care for you
Send me the pillow that you dream on so darling I can dream on it too
Each night while I'm sleeping oh so lonely
I share your love in dreams that once were true
Send me the pillow that you dream on so darling I can dream on it too
[ guitar ]
I've waited so long for you to write me but just a mem'ry's all that's left of you
Send me the pillow that you dream on so darling I can dream on it too

// Beginning Of The End //

(I know we've reached the beginning of the end)
I know your love is growing cold for your kiss is barely warm
It's like the quiet before the night it's like the calm before the storm
When we're kissing something's missing and things aren't like they've been
I know we've reached the beginning of the end
The beginning of the end for you and me I love you but I've lost you I can see
I don't know who I've lost you to I don't know where or why or when
I know we've reached the beginning of the end
I know we've reached the beginning of the end

// Today //

Today I'm like a leaf in autumn never again to know the spring
Today my heart is at rock bottom sorrow nothing else could bring
But the words you told me just today you said I'm only in your way
You left me and what could I say for my world ended today
[ steel ]
All the words you told me just today you said I'm only in your way
I'm lost I'll never find my way for my world ended today
