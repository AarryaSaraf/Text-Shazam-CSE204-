// Bargain Basement Dress //

Well on a Friday night you draw your pay and you take in the town
You leave me at home just to lose my mind for you are messin' around
But it's four in the morning and you stagger in and you sure look a mess
With a smile on your face and out stretched arms and a bargain basement dress
I wouldn't wear that dress to a dogfight if your side was free
And the bargain basemant dress ain't enough to get your arms around me
Well you say when a man was hard all week he deserves to play all rest
But honey that ain't right to get out of my side with that bargain basement dress
[ dobro - steel ]
I wouldn't wear that dress to a dogfight if your side was free
And the bargain basemant dress ain't enough to get your arms around me
Now I took all I'm a gonna take and I'm a leavin' you the rest
Tell you what I'll do I'll just leave you that bargain basement dress
Tell you what I'll do I'll just leave you that old bargain basement dress

// Dark Moon //

Dark moon a way up high up in the sky
Oh tell me why oh tell me why you've lost your splendor
Dark moon why is the cause your light withdraws
Is it because is it because I've lost my love

Mortals have dreams of love's perfect schemes
But they don't realize that love can sometimes bring
Dark moon a way up high...
[ ac.guitar ]
Mortals have dreams...
Dark moon a way up high...

// If Loneliness Can Kill Me //

I walk the floor here in my lonely room
The silence nearly kills me and I guess that it will soon
He left because of things I've done and said
And if loneliness can kill me then I'm just as good as dead
If loneliness can kill me then I might as well lay down
A girl who could die anytime shouldn't be a walkin' round
I'd better find a place to lay my head
For if loneliness can kill me then I'm just as good as dead
[ piano ]
If loneliness can kill me...

// It's Such A Pretty World Today //

It's such a pretty world today I look at the sunshine
And every day's the same since I met you
It's such a pretty world today knowin' that you're mine
And happinsess is being close to you
And though the rain may fall my skies will all be blue
If I look close enough the sun would come shinin' through
It's such a pretty world today look at the sunshine
Today and every day since I met you
[ guitar - steel ]
Though the rain may fall...
Today and every day since I met you

// Wanted Woman //

(Unwanted girl wanted woman)
I'm a girl from state of old Kentucky
My mommy said she didn't want me from the start
Since the first day I was born I follow trouble
Too much hate without some love can't free the heart
Unwanted girl wanted woman unwanted girl wanted woman
Me alone against the world and all that's in it
I choose every wrong companion I can find
And the hate that grows within me I can't conquer
Life itself has left me with a twisted mind
Unwanted girl wanted woman unwanted girl wanted woman
And I met a man and realized I loved him
Told him I would change if I could be his wife
But he laughed at me and said he didn't love me
I did all I knew to do I took his life
Unwanted girl wanted woman unwanted girl wanted woman

// Slowly Killing Me //

Oh I can't live without you and I'm barely livin' with you
I can't get her off your mind and I can't set you free
When you look at one another your look tells me you love her
And that's the part that slowly killing me
Oh what's this other woman done to you she can't ever love you like I do
Cry tears enough to drown me heartache's closing in around me
And that's the part that slowly killing me
[ steel ]
Oh what's this other woman done to you why she can't ever love you like I do
I'd die the night you leave me I cry but you don't see me
And that's the part that slowly killing me
Yes that's the part that slowly killing me

// I'll Sure Come A Long Way Down //

Take out all my hair blonde today to change my homy touch
I'll even learn a joke to tell that makes my pale face blush
I'll change the high neck dress I wear to low cut dress I found
To come up to what you're wantin' I'll sure come a long way down
I'll put on heavy makeup so the real me won't show through
I'll be the thing I hate the most if I can't be with you
I'll come to the dark and dirty streets in the roughest part of town
To come up to what you're wantin' I'll sure come a long way down
[ steel ]
I'll wear my lipstick much too red and a dress that fits too tight
I'll be the kinda girl you want to fit into your life
I'll give up everything that's good rechange to the things you bound
To come up to what you're wantin' I'll sure come a long way down
I'll put on heavy makeup...

// Walk Through This World With Me //

Walk through this world with me go where I go
Share all my dreams with me oh I need you so
In life we search and some of us find I've looked for you a long long time
And now that I found you new horizons I see
Come take my hand and walk through this world with me
[ ac.guitar ]
Walk through this world with me go where I go
Share all my dreams with me I've searched for you so
And now that I found you...
Come take my hand and walk through this world with me

// If You're Not Gone Too Long //

I'm gonna wipe these teardrops from my eyes there ain't no use for me to cry
And there's some things I think I need to say
I'll think about you every day every day while you're away
I'll be true to you honey while you're gone if you're not gone too long
But if you're gone for a year or two it may be too long for me to be true
I might find somebody else cause I get lonesome by myself
I'll be the truest love you've known and for a while I'll stay at home
I'll be true to you honey while you're gone if you're not gone too long
[ guitar - steel ]
Tomorrow you'll be gone I know so love me now before you go
We don't know what's farther down the road
There may be a detour sign to upset plans of yours and mine
I'll be true to you honey while you're gone if you're not gone too long
But if you're gone for a year or two...
Oh yeah if you're not gone too long

// What Now //

If it's over between us what now can't forget you cause I don't know how
Oh what will I do where do I go from you if it's over between us what now
If my heart's been deserted what now can't I stop it from beating somehow
If there's no more you and I that I'll want to die if it's over between us what now
I keep asking where did our love go you won't tell me and I sure don't know
All I know is what's left is our love worse and dead if it's over between us what now
If it's over between us what now

// Place To Hide And Cry //

Today I saw you for the first time in a long time
You looked so happy it brought tears to my eyes
I tried to speak the words would not come through me
So I ran to find a place to hide and cry
A place to hide and cry a place to try and die
Yes I ran to find a place to hide and cry
[ steel ]
I suppose in ways I'm weak just like a baby
But my love for you is stronger than my pride
Each time I think of you oh how it hurts me
And I have to find a place to hide and cry
A place to hide and cry a place to try and die
Yes I have to find a place to hide and cry
