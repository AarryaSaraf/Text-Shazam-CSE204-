(Who says God is dead who says God is dead)
Who says God is dead I'm a talkin' to him now
Who says God is dead he's with us all right now
He knows every move that you make he knows every time you make a mistake
The rumor has been spread who says God is dead
Who says God is dead that's stooped and mighty low
I like to meet 'em face to face and tell 'em it's not so
I've got my Saviour by the hand he's leadin' me to the Promised Land
No I'm not out of my head who says God is dead

Who says God is dead he's a watchin' you right now
Who says God is dead he's a reachin' for you now
If I were you I'd kneel and pray cause we're not promised one more day
Remember blood was shed who says God is dead
Who says God is dead...
Who says God is dead who says God is dead who says God is dead
