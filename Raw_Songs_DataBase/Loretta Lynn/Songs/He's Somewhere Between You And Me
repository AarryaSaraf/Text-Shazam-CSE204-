I don't know the location he's usin' he's so close and still I can't see
But I know all the heartache he's bringin' sure he's somewhere between you and me
When you say that you love me I don't doubt it
But he tells me the same things you see
All I know he's on my mind much too often cause he's somewhere between you and me
Yes he's somewhere between you and me give me time to erase his memory
Cause my heart has to be free completely and he's somewhere between you and me

Yes he's somewhere...
Yes he's somewhere between you and me
