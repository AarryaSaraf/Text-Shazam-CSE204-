We were proud of this house that we found
On a street in the nice part of town
Had it furnished with care we were once happy here
Now it's a beautiful unhappy home

Planted red sweet hard roses for you
Painted our rooms your favorite blue
Now the colors remain but our love's not the same
Oh it's a beautiful unhappy home

What a beautiful unhappy home
It's so hard to believe it's our own
But we're both held here by a child
We love dear in this beautiful unhappy home

Yes we're both held here by a child
We love dear in this beautiful unhappy home
In our beautiful unhappy home
