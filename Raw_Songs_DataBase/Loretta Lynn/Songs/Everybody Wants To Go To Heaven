Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die

Once upon a time there lived a man
And his name was Hezekiah
He walked with God both day and night
But he didn't wanna die

He cried, "Oh Lord, please let me live
Death is close, I know"
God smiled down on Hezekiah
And gave him fifteen years to go

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die
Lord, I wanna go to Heaven
But I don't wanna die

I long for the day when I'll have new birth
Still I love livin' here on Earth
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die

When Jesus lived here on this Earth
He knew his father's plan
He knew that he must give his life
To save the soul of man

When Judas had betrayed him
His father heard him cry
He was brave until his death
But he didn't wanna die

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die
Lord, I wanna go to Heaven
But I don't wanna die

I long for the day when I'll have new birth
Still I love livin' here on Earth
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die
Lord, I wanna go to Heaven
But I don't wanna die

I long for the day when I'll have new birth
Still I love livin' here on Earth
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to die
