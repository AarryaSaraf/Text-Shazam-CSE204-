It's a breakin' day and here you come with eyes as red as far
You tell me that you've done nothin' and you don't know how right you are
With the little home chores you used to do and they've all gone to pot
So I'm a schootin' for tomorrow cause today's already shot
I'm a schootin' for tomorrow cause today's already shot
After all I'm gonna take and honey that's a lot
Well you used to think you's the only man but I found out you're not
So I'm a schootin' for tomorrow cause today's already shot

I used to keep the home from burnin' but I let 'em all go out
So don't hand me that ---
Now this old house is a gettin' cold and I'm a goin' where the climate's hot
So I'm a schootin' for tomorrow cause today's already shot
I'm a schootin' for tomorrow...
I'm a schootin' for tomorrow cause today's already shot
