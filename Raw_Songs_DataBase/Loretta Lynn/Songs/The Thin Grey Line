I can't say that it's black
I can't say that it's white
Is it really wrong
Is it really right

We don't know
Where to place it
I guess we'll have
To face it
We walk the thin grey line of love

We shouldn't be together
We have so much to lose
One of us must make the choice
But please don't make me choose

I feel I've got to have you
I feel the same way too
Our love should go
For we both know
We walk the thin grey line of love

We both tried hard to break up
But we just break each vow
If you'll just say you don't love me
I'd stay away somehow

But you know I can't say it
And I'd die if you could
We'll break our home as if we'll go on
Walkin' the thin grey line of love

Yes, we walk the thin grey line of love...
