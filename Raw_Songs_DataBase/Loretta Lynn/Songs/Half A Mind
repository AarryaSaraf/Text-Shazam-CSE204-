I don't love you like I used to do but I'm afraid to tell you so
Cause I've got half a mind to leave you but only half the heart to go
Now words to tell you just don't come to me I guess my courage is too slow
Cause I've got half a mind to leave you but only half the heart to go

Now time may prove that you are not to blame but now the time I need to know
Cause I've got half a mind to leave you but only half the heart to go
Yes I've got half a mind to leave you but only half the heart to go
