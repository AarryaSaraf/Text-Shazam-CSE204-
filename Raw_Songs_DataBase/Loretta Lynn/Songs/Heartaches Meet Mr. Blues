Well here I am with my head bowed low my tears they're rolling down
My baby's with somebody new in a honky tonk in town

Hello Mr Lonesome did you bring any news
Come on in Mr Heartache and meet Mr Blues

When my baby left this mornin' said he wouldn't be home no more
I can hear still hear the echo of him a slammin' my back door

Hello Mr Lonesome did you bring any news
Come on in Mr Heartache and meet Mr Blues

Hello Mr Lonesome did you bring any news
Come on in Mr Heartache and meet Mr Blues
