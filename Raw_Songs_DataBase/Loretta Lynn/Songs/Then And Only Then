In your haste you left and said you'd be returnin'
In my sorrow I forgot to ask you when
In my lonely room I sit and count the hours
Every minute hopin' I'll look up and you'll come walkin' in
For then and only then will I stop cryin'
And this aching breaking heart of mine will mend
Not until I feel your arms around me will I be happy and I live for then and only then

All that's left inside my heart is just your echo
And the tiny thread of hope to which I cling
But if I keep holding on maybe some day
You'll remember where you left me and come back for me again
For then and only then...
