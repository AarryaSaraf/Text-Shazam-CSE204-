When I'm cryin', just cryin' over what we've become
That's not but cry though I look there on the demage that we've done
We can start here not parted for there's hope for me and you
If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do.

If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do
My heart tells me to forget her and I'll forget him too
I'll take a step in your direction and toward you I'll take two
If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do.

It's not rain it's just pain runnin' down my face
I feel certain that's a hurtin' won't leave any trace
We'll erase it just replace it with a love we once knew
If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do.

If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do
My heart tells me to forget her and I'll forget him too
I'll take a step in your direction and toward you I'll take two
If we put our heads together our hearts will tell us what to do...
