Many heartaches have passed since we met there's a kind that a heart can't forget
And the sweet memories are too few while I'm living my lifetime for you
I'm living my life for you you're living to break me in two
I'd die while you're being untrue still I'm living my lifetime for you

If ever there should come a time when you feel that you'd like to die
Well you've made me feel that way too but I'm living my lifetime for you
I'm living my life for you...
