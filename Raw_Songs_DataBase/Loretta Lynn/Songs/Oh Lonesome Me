Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how he set set me free oh lonesome me
A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool is blind and just can't see oh lonesome me
Well I'll bet he's not like me he's out and fancy free
Flirtin' with the girls with all his charms
Oh but I still love him so and brother don't you know
I'd welcome him right back here in my arms
There must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues
Forget about the past and find somebody new
I've thought of everything from A to Z oh lonesome me

Well I'll bet he's not like me...
Oh lonesome me oh lonesome me
