Let me go please let me go you're hurtin' me
I've lost all your love so I can't understand
Are you holdin' on to just show me you can
This grip you have on me is as tight as it can be
Let me go please let me go you're hurtin' me
Stayin' here unwanted will be the death of me
Needing love that you won't give me so desperately
It's more than I can stand let me go for I still can
Let me go please let me go you're hurtin' me

Got no place to go but I'll go anyway if I go I'll cry and I'll cry if I stay
I still love you can't you see and I don't want to be free
Let me go please let me go you're hurtin' me
Stayin' here unwanted...
