You say tomorrow you're going it's so hard for me to believe
I'm making plans for the heartaches cause you're making plans to leave
The tears for me will be falling like a tree that shedding its leaves
I'm making plans for the teardrops cause you're making plans to leave
You're making plans to forget me I'm making plans to miss you
I'm getting ready to grieve
I'm making plans to be lonesome cause you're making plans to leave

Yes you're making plans to leave
