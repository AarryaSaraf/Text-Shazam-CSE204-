No I'm not crying it just looks that way
He thinks his leaving me will drive me mad silly boy he's the smallest hurt I've had
These ain't tears I'm standing in it rains today
No I'm not crying it just looks that way
No I'm not crying it just looks that way
I convince my heart I'm happy and make believe everything I say
He thinks he left me lonesome and hurtin' every day
Oh but I'm not crying it just looks that way

No I'm not crying...
Oh but I'm not crying it just looks that way
