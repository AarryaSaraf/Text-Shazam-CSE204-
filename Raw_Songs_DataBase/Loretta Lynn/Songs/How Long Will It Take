(How long will it take) how long will it take to make you need me
I keep a waitin' and a wonderin' how long will it take
Well you keep a tellin' me your love I'm winnin'
Then you turn right around and you treat me hard and cold
Well I ain't got but one life here I'm livin'
So if you're gonna love me baby I've gotta know
(How long will it take) how long will it take to make you want me
How much longer has this old heart gotta break
(How long will it take) how long will it take to make you need me
I keep a waitin' and a wonderin' how long will it take

Now there ain't a thing on earth that don't need a lovin'
And baby I'm no exception to the rule
But if you keep a puttin' everything above me
Well how in this world will I ever get through to you
(How long will it take...
