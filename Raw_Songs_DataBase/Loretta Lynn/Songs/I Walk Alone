I walk alone where once we wandered it seems so strange that you are gone
Till you return I'll stay the same dear I'll still be true and walk alone
The flame of love is brightly burning you know that I'm your very own
Till you return I'll stay the same dear I'll still be true and walk alone

The flame of love...
