How long did you think you could go on hurtin' me
And I'd be your fool and wait at home alone
Well you go out and have your fun like you are free
Tonight I'll have some pleasures of my own
Cause a shoe goes on the other foot tonight
We'll find out if two wrongs can make a right
Tonight I'll push my heartaches out of sight
Cause a shoe goes on the other foot tonight

Each time you walk out the door you walk on me
And you leave the door wide open for the blues
You fly away from me like you are free
You must think there's wings upon your shoes
But a shoe goes on...
Yes a shoe goes on the other foot tonight
