Please listen to me bartender
I've got something on my mind
I think I might feel better
After one more glass of wine.

I'm payin' for a broken heart
The price of love is high
With nothing left to live for
What's there to do but die.

I know your story honey, 
they're all the same you see
Why, I knew the minute that you walked in
You want to talk to me.

But I've learned what you don't read in books
From words that cross this bar
I've seen them come and I've seen them drink
Till they don't even know who they are.

Now, I don't believe that a honky tonk
Is a place for a girl like you
I might be wrong but you don't look right
Sittin' there on that barstool.

It's not too late so stop and think
before all of your pride is gone
You can end up like all the rest
with a barroom for your home.

I know you're right bartender
Goodnight, I'm going home...
