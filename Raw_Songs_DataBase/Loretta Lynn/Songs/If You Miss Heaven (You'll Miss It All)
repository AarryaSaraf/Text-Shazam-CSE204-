If you're tired of sinnin' take your Saviour's hand
There's a mansion worth winnin' in the great Promised Land
Many debtors are grinnin' don't you slip and fall if you miss heaven you'll miss it all
If you miss heaven you'll miss it all for me to reach heaven I'd gladly crawl
The smallest and weakest who love him or toss if you miss heaven you'll miss it all

Our loving Saviour gave us a sake of birth
And his salvation frees us from the sorrows of earth
Forever with Jesus may life seem so small if you miss heaven you'll miss it all
If you miss heaven...
