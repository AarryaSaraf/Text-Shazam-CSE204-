Well you come home most every night as grouchy as can be
And start right in a pickin' on our little kids and me
I'm sick and tired of hearin' are you worth keep you a trigon
Cause you seem to forget big boy that two mules pull this wagon
Yeah two mules pull this wagon you don't do it by yourself
I know you've got a heavy load but it give you lots of hell
I do my share of pullin' and I don't mean to be bridled
But you seem to forget big boy that two mules pull this wagon

Well I guess you think while you're at work I sit and watch TV
But you'd learn different honey if you'd spent one day with me
I'm washin' ironin' cookin' so and find out for your nigher
But you seem to forget big boy that two mules pull this wagon
Yeah two mules pull this wagon...
Yeah you seem to forget big boy that two mules pull this wagon
