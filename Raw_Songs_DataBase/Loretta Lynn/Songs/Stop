Stop you're foolin' me oh stop and let me be
I can't understand a love that's second hand
When it's on true and just like driftin' sand

Stop danger's in sight oh stop it's just not right
To break a heart like mine and then leave me behind
Oh please stop cause you know I'm not your kind

Why do you want to do me this a way
When you have yourself a new girl every day

Oh please stop danger's ahead oh stop just like you've led
Someday you will see just what you've done to me
You'll be glad to say that you're sorry

Stop you're foolin' me oh stop and let me be
I can't understand a love that's second hand
When it's on true and just like driftin' sand

Stop danger's in sight oh stop it's just not right
To break a heart like mine and then leave me behind
Oh please stop cause you know I'm not your kind

Why do you want to do me this a way
When you have yourself a new girl every day

Oh please stop danger's ahead oh stop just like you've led
Someday you will see just what you've done to me
You'll be glad to say that you're sorry
You'll be glad to say that you're sorry
