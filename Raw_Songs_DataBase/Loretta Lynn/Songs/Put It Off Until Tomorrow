Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
You say our love is over that you have found another
You say you're goin' away but leave me tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
You've hurt me enough today I can't believe the words you say
I must accept the fact you won't be coming back
So stay just one more day loneliness isn't far away
Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today

Put it off until tomorrow oh oh you've hurt me enough today
