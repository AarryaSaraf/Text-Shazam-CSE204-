I overlooked a love I couldn't see
Until that day you walked away from me
That's what it took for this poor fool to find
That your sweet love was right here all the time

When we broke up I started searchin' to
For our love hid from me as well as you
How could I be so foolish and so blind
When your true love was right here all the time

Right here was love when neither one expected it to be
Right here was love before our eyes that neither one could see
We'll let the world go by dear we won't mind
For our true love was right here all the time

Right here was love...
