At my door the leaves are falling a cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together and I still miss someone
I never got over those blue eyes I see them everywehere
I miss those arms that held me when all the love was there
I wonder if he's sorry for leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere and I still miss someone
There's someone for me somewhere and I still miss someone
