You're standin' there a sayin' I'm no good and I'm so ashamed I'd die if I could
But you're no better than I am or have you given this one thought
The only thing that's different I got caught
Over night you left me all alone and the only arms close to me was my own
And now you're blame on me but it's not all my fault
The only thing that's different I got caught
Yeah I got caught but honey you're a pro
There's not a thing about cheatin' you don't know
That same old line you sell is the same old line I bought
The thing you've got away with I got caught

Yeah I got caught...
Yeah the thing you've got away with I got caught
