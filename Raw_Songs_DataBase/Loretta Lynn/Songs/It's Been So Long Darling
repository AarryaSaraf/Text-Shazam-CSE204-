It's been so long darlin' since you had to go away
It's been so long darlin' and I'll never forget that day
Although I never mentioned it I cried the whole day long
It's been so long darlin' but now you're comin' home

It's been so long darlin' but it won't be long now
It's been so long darlin' and I've kept ev'ry vow
You'll find me right here waitin' as you did in days gone by
It's been so long darlin' please don't blame me if I cry

It's been so long darlin' since I gazed into your eyes
It's been so long darlin' do you really realize
That's just the thought of seeing you it scares me through and through
It's been so long darlin' since I had a kiss from you
It's been so long darlin' but now you're comin' home
