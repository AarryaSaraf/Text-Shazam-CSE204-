Oh I might as well be talking to the wall
I've known so long with me you've been unsatisfied
So I finally found the strenght to say goodbye
Why already I forgot a million memories and leaving you was easy as could be
But I might as well be talking to the wall when I tell myself I'm not missin' you at all
Cause every time you come around I fall and I might as well be talking to the wall

It seems there's not a day that some friends of mine
Don't bring back the mem'ries I'll recall
But I smile and say you know it's been a long long time
And I hardly remember him at all
But I might as well be...
Yes I might as well be talking to the wall
