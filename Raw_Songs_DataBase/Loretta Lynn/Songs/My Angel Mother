I'm writing this song about a girl that I know
She's just as pure as all silver and gold
I might search this world over but I couldn't find
No one to take the place of this mother of mine

Mother that's the sweetest name of them all
You're an angel on earth and to me you are worth
More than anything else in this world

I love you more day by day and I can never repay
All the things that you've done for me
Your heart is filled with joyous times
And your eyes oh how they shine
That's the story of this mother of mine

Mother that's the sweetest name of them all
You're an angel on earth and to me you are worth
More than anything else in this world

Mother
