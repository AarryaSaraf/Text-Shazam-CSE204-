How I like the old time preachin' prayin' singin' shoutin'
How I like the old time readin' of God's words
How I like to hear that old time hallelujah glory
How I like the old time worship of the Lord

Long ago when just a child at old camp meetin' time
How my heart would beat with joy to hear the old bells chime
Callin' all the saints of God onto the house of prayer
Oh such prayin' singin' shoutin' for the Lord was there
How I like the old time preachin'...

Preachin' in them good ole days was still the world acclaim
Preachin' for the souls of men and not for wordly fame
Under such old fashion preachin' sinners knelt and pray
And the Lord would save them in that good ole fashion way
How I like the old time preachin'...
