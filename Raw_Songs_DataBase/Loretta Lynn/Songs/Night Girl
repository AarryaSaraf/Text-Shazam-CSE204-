You say you'd like to be with me tonight someplace where we can hide from your world
But if you're ashamed to show me up in daylight
Then I can't see why I should be your night girl
I guess you think I'll be your poor girl price who'll never fit into your social world
But if you're too good for me in your own eyes
Then I can't see why I should be your night girl
You were born into a wealthy family I was born into a world of poverty
So if you're too proud to have me in your world
Then I can't see why I should be your night girl

You were born into a wealthy family...
