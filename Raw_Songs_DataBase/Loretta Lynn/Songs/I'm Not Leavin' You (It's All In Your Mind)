It's all in your mind that I'm leavin' you
I've been afraid you'd find somebody new
If I lost you it would break this heart of mine
I'm not leaving you it's all in your mind

You can't blame me for havin' my suspicions
When hearts are broken each and ever day
Just listen to your heart and what it tells you
Don't listen to the lies that people say
It's all in your mind that I could let you go
I try to think you'll never hurt me so
For I know that I can't change this heart of mine
I'm not leaving you it's all in your mind

You can't blame me for havin' my suspicions
When hearts are broken each and ever day
Just listen to your heart and what it tells you
Don't listen to the lies that people say
It's all in your mind that I could let you go
I try to think you'll never hurt me so
For I know that I can't change this heart of mine
I'm not leaving you it's all in your mind
