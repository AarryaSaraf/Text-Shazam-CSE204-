By your side each minute's where I wanna be
Can't get you off my mind and let it rest in peace
So every step you make I wanna make it too oh I can't keep away from you
Well I don't care where you are as long as you're with me
You're every dream I dream you're every breath I breathe
My shadow follows you loves everything you do why I can't keep away from you
Oh I can't keep away from you I couldn't if I wanted to
No matter how hard I try or what I do
You've got my heart and soul that's why I need you so
You're holding on to me I know I can't let go
But all what I go through to prove my love is true oh I can't keep away from you

Baby I can't keep away from you
