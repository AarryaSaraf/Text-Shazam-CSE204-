His sweet caress
His tenderness
His warm embrace
His gentle face
I love him so
I'll let him know
That he's my love

Oh, moon up there
Show him I care
Give him my love
Oh, moon above
He'll always be
The one for me
'Cause he's my love

Oh, moon up there
Show him I care
Give him my love
Oh, moon above
He'll always be
The one for me
'Cause he's my love, love, love, love
