Today I'm like a leaf in autumn never again to know the spring
Today my heart is at rock bottom sorrow nothing else could bring
But the words you told me just today you said I'm only in your way
You left me and what could I say for my world ended today

All the words you told me just today you said I'm only in your way
I'm lost I'll never find my way for my world ended today
