(Someday I'll be strong enough to make that church bells ring
And when my voice grows steady I can help the choir sing
Somehow I can be usefull so put me to the test
I know I can't do very much but Lord I'll do my best)
Last night just at bed time I looked in upon my son
And the picture I saw as I stood there was surely a blessed one
Proudly I watched and listened to all he tried to say
Cause it makes my heart just burst with pride when I hear my children pray
And he said dear Lord I'm just a little boy and I don't know how to pray
But so many of your people has slowly turned away
Well maybe there's something I can do to help in your great plan
I know I can't do very much but I'll do the best I can
Couldn't I light the little candles or maybe sweep the pews
I'll do anything dear Lord just as long as it's for you
Why can I open up the doors or dust your sacred stand
I know I can do something if you'll just hold my hand
Yes proudly I stood and listened to all he tried to say
And it makes my heart just burst with pride when I hear my children pray
(I know I can't do very much but Lord I'll do my best)
