Well here you come and I know what I'm gonna say
My mind's made up and I'm a leavin' you today
Well I'm tired of askin' you where you've been I'm tired of all this mis'ry I'm in
Two steps forward and six steps back again
Well my clothes're packed and I'm a headin' for the door
Don't look for me back cause I won't be back no more
Well I may think of you now and then
But don't hold your breath cause I don't know when
Two steps forward and six steps back again
Two steps forward and six steps back you think I didn't want to go
These tears in my eyes they're not so real I'm just cuttin' on a show
I'm leavin' this town and that's for certain
Not much I ain't a cryin' not much I ain't a hurtin'
Two steps forward and six steps back again

Two steps forward and six steps back...
Yeah two steps forward and six steps back again
