You love to put me down each time you're out with your girlfriends
They ask you if I treat you bad you say that all depends
Well don't you know they realize that you've been slippin' round
They know how you carry on when I go out of town

You've got no room to criticize with words you know will hurt
I'm still countin' lipstick stains on your dirty shirt
People pass me on the street and shake their heads in pity
While I wait at home you've got a girl in ever city

Yes I'll admit it what you say is true
But I only run around because you do it too
If we could have what we once had how happy we could be
I won't cheat again on you if you won't cheat on me

You'll never know how many nights I've stayed awake and cried
Ashamed of what I did to you and feelin' sick inside
Now I can walk away from him without a backward glance
I'm grateful that you're big enough to give me a second chance

Now many nights in many towns I've wrestled with the blues
I never found the nighttime girl who could fill your shoes
How I wish I'd swallowed pride and come to you before
You'll never find another man who could love you more

Yes I'll admit it what you say is true
But I only run around because you do it too
If we could have what we once had how happy we could be
I won't cheat again on you if you won't cheat on me
I won't cheat again on you if you won't cheat on me
