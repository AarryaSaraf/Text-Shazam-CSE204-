I've got my angel on my mind that's why I'm walkin'
There's such an ache in this old heart well I ain't talkin'
The hand that held mine tight just waved goodbye tonight
I've got my angel on my mind that's why I'm walkin'
With an old love in your heart life's not worth livin'
I breathe his name with every breath I'm breathin'
Why can't he ever see how much he means to me
I've got my angel on my mind that's why I'm walkin'

When I pass you on the street and I miss speakin'
Just blame it on this memory I'm keepin'
My head is bowed down low the hurt is bound to show
I've got my angel on my mind that's why I'm walkin'
