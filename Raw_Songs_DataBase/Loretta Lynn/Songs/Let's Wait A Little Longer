I can see you are not happy the way you've been acting
And I think you'd like to be free
I know he's a good man but I know that you can be
A whole lot happier with me.

In your eyes there's a yearning and inside you're a burning
And I'd like to put out the flame
So let's get together like birds of a feather
And we let the love take the blame.

But right now I don't think that I can leave him
For lately he's been so good to me
And there might be once more chance that things might work out
So let's wait a little longer then we'll see.

But the way I can make you forget him 'cause I'll take you
To places that you've never been
We may call the night spots the dim and the bright spots
And then we'll forget where we've been.

We'll walk sunny beaches and taste Georgia peaches
And swing from Maine to Mexico
If you'll come along we can make life a song
And you won't be tied down anymore.

But still I don't think that I can leave him
For lately he's been so good to me
And there might be one more chance that things might work out
So let's wait a little longer then we'll see.

Yes, let's wait a little longer then we'll see...
