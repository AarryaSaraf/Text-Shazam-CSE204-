You want me to prove my love for you
I'm surprised that's the way you're askin' me to
You've known me so long I can't understand what kind of a girl do you think I am
What kind of a girl do you want for a wife
Do you want a girl who knows that much about life
Well if that's what you want take me out of your plans
What kind of a girl do you think I am

What kind of a girl would do the things you're askin' me to without wedding rings
Is it what you must do to prove you're a man what kind of a girl do you think I am
What kind of a girl...
