You came from the city streets to my little country town
Your spell is on my baby and you've got me sorrow bound
You don't really love him you're playin' around for fun
Woman of the world leave my world alone
You're the devil's woman that's what my man don't know
Why I wear more in swimmin' than you wear to parties where you go
There's a place I know where you should go for that's where you belong
Woman of the world leave my world alone

I don't know about the things the bright lights talk to you
My country boy don't know them any better than I do
I'll have to watch him hurtin' after you are gone
Woman of the world leave my world alone
You're the devil's woman...
