Dark moon a way up high up in the sky
Oh tell me why oh tell me why you've lost your splendor
Dark moon why is the cause your light withdraws
Is it because is it because I've lost my love

Mortals have dreams of love's perfect schemes
But they don't realize that love can sometimes bring
Dark moon a way up high...

Mortals have dreams...
Dark moon a way up high...
