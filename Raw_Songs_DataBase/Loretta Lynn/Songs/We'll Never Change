The years will see us together
As they quickly pass away
Our hair'll make it lighter
But our love will burn brighter
In our hearts we'll never change.

We'll say that all our mem'ries
Of every passing day
Time may rearrange us
But we know it won't change us
In our hearts we'll never change.

Time may change the way we look
But not the way we feel
We'll say that all our mem'ries
Of every passing day
Time may rearrange us
But we know it won't change us
In our hearts we'll never change.

In our hearts we'll never change...
