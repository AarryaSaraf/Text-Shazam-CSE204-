Have you found since you turned me down the one that you've been searching for
Are you glad that you made me sad for you know you vowed to love me ever more
What did you have in mind when you broke this heart of mine
Are you laughing in my face
Tell me what can I do when you say that we are through
You've left a wound time can't erase

Tell me dear are you satisfied to be foot loose and fancy free
Is it power you want for the things that you have done
What you've gained I guess I'll never see
What did you have in mind...
