Don't you think it's a little too late to show those tears
Just look out the way you're treatin' me all these years
I'm a full grown woman but you're treatin' me like a kid
You didn't like my lovin' so I found someone that did
You didn't like my lovin' so I found someone that did
And the one I found really made me flip my lid
After all that past I'm learnin' to live at last
You didn't like my lovin' so I found someone that did

Far as I'm concerned you can turn and walk out that door
Cause the way we'd made it don't make it with me no more
Where your head used to lay there's another head there instead
You didn't like my lovin' so I found someone that did
You didn't like my lovin'...
You didn't like my lovin' so I found someone that did
