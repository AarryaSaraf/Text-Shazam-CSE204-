I chased you till you caught me you had plans of your own
It didn't come as no surpise and you knew it all alone
Now I guess you think you're a pretty cheek but I've got news for you
It don't really matter to me just who caught who.

Well, it was a long hard race I thought I've finally won
I thought I really played it smart but brother was I dumb
You thought you'd pull to figure out and won my heart and hand
But things were only workin' out accordin' to my plans.

I chased you till you caught me you had plans of your own
It didn't come as no surpise and you knew it all alone
Now I guess you think you're a pretty cheek but I've got news for you
It don't really matter to me just who caught who.

Now you were playin' hard to get just danglin' on a string
I was only holdin' out for a pretty weddin' ring
So you went to the jewelry's to get my big surprise
But you done been there a month before and given them your size.

I chased you till you caught me you had plans of your own
It didn't come as no surpise and you knew it all alone
Now I guess you think you're a pretty cheek but I've got news for you
It don't really matter to me just who caught who.

It don't really matter to me just who caught who...
