I'll just call you darling and I'll call you the same
And if we ever cry out in the night we won't call each other's name

I'm afraid that I'm falling and I'm falling too
But we both belong to others we're not free
I know I'll dream about you but if you'll call my name
We'll both hurt someone who shouldn't be

So I'll just call you darling...

I didn't mean for it to happen and we can't turn back time
But it just happened we can't help it now
I have no right to hurt her and he's still in love with me
Why we're the ones who broke our wedding vows

So I'll just call you darling...
