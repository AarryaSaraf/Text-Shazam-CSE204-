I don't believe I'll fall in love today fond memories of you stand in the way
I just can't make my heart find someone new it's always much too busy loving you
Each night I pray I'll wake at dawn and find another in my heart and on my mind
Then I'll wake and I'll hear my poor heart say I don't believe I'll fall in love today

I don't believe I'll fall in love today for if I did I'm sure I wouldn't stay
You'd come between us like you always do
Somehow he'd never measure up to you
Each night I pray...
