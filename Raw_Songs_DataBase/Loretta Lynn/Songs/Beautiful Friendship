Can't tell you how to win friends and influence people
You can leave that to me that philosophy
But I know the score about gettin' married
That's the best way I know to make an enemy

We broke up a beautiful friendship when we married
These cat'n dog fights get the best of me
We broke up a beautiful friendship when we married
Now we're each other's own worse enemy

Aw Steve

And buddy

We call a truce and then we kiss and makeup
But then you say that I'm not kissin' right
When I pass the salt it should've been the pepper
Just anything will start another fight

We broke up a beautiful friendship when we married
These cat'n dog fights get the best of me
We broke up a beautiful friendship when we married
Now we're each other's own worse enemy
Now we're each other's own worse enemy
