Now we go our seperate ways Mr and Mrs Used To Be
For oh so long I've loved you I know that you loved me
But time moved on and we grew far apart
It's not the way I wanted but the judge has set you free
Although you're still the first one in my heart
I just don't understand it how people such as we
Could know the love that we have known but somehow disagree
I hope that you'll be happy the same dear you from me
Now we go our seperate ways Mr and Mrs Used To Be

At first it was like heaven on earth for you and me
But heaven's sure has changed a lot since then
I can't put all the blame on you for some belongs to me
But started out at heaven reached an end
I guess we could have made it but pride stood in our way
For love to live it must have worked we never seemed the same
And so I say goodbye now kiss the kids for me
Now we go our seperate ways Mr and Mrs Used To Be
