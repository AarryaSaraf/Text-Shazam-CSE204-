How sweet and happy seem those days of which I dream
When memory recalls them now and then
And with what rapture sweet my weary heart would beat
If I could hear my mother pray again
If I could hear my mother pray again if I could hear her tender voice as then
How glad I would be with who means so much to me
If I could hear my mother pray again

She used to pray that I on Jesus would rely and always walk the shining gospel way
So trusting still his love I'll seek that home above
For I shall meet my mother some glad day
If I could hear my mother...
