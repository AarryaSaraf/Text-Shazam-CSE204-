(Unwanted girl wanted woman)
I'm a girl from state of old Kentucky
My mommy said she didn't want me from the start
Since the first day I was born I follow trouble
Too much hate without some love can't free the heart
Unwanted girl wanted woman unwanted girl wanted woman
Me alone against the world and all that's in it
I choose every wrong companion I can find
And the hate that grows within me I can't conquer
Life itself has left me with a twisted mind
Unwanted girl wanted woman unwanted girl wanted woman
And I met a man and realized I loved him
Told him I would change if I could be his wife
But he laughed at me and said he didn't love me
I did all I knew to do I took his life
Unwanted girl wanted woman unwanted girl wanted woman
