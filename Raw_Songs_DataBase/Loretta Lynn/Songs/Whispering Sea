I sat down by the sea and it whispered to me
It brought back an old love affair that used to be
It told me that you had found someone new
And lead me to cry over you

Whispering sea rolling by, now don't you listen to me cry?
I cry as though my heart is broke in two
Oh, how I love him so, no one will ever know
No one but the drifting, whispering sea

Well, I thought I'd left behind all his love but I was blind
I should have known that there was no use to pretend
I thought a new love I would find, and you would never cross my mind
But the whispering sea, it talked to me

Whispering sea rolling by, now don't you listen to me cry?
I cry as though my heart is broke in two
Oh, how I love him so, no one will ever know
No one but the drifting, whispering sea
