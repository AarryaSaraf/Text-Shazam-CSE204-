I live in the world world of forgotten people
Who've loved and lost their hearts so many times
I'm here in the world world of forgotten people
Where every heart is aching just like mine

Well I've loved and I'd been loved but I had the reckless heart
And the many dreams I had are torn apart
Now I find out I was loved too late I'm all alone alone in the world of broken heart
I live in the world...
