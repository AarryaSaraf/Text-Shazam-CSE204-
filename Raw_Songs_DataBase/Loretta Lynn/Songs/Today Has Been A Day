Today has been a day filled with heartaches but tonight I'll be happy again
The flashing lights call out the lonely from the darkness
On each door reads the welcome come on in
Another night anothet fight with my mem'ries with a glass in my hand I forget
Today has gone with coming on I started cryin'
Today has been a day another day of regret
A cryzy fool oh what a fool to ever let you go
Now I can see you don't need me and that's what hurts me so
Yes today has been a day filled with misery just how lonesome can one poor girl get
I said today that I'd forget but I haven't yet
Today has been a day another day of regret
Today has been a day another day of regret
