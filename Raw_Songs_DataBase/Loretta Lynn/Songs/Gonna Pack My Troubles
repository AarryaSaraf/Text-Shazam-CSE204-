I'm gonna pack my troubles in a big suitcase and dump'em in the deep blue sea
Come all your lovers from misery lane and a tag along with me
Well I'm tired of livin' this kind of life wantin' things that just can't be
I'm gonna pack my troubles in a big suitcase and dump 'em in the deep blue sea

Well then that ole sun it'll start to shine and I won't be blue no more
Well then I'll find myself a brand new love that's a what I'm longin' for
Well the loves I had they've made me sad left my heart swingin' from a tree
I'm gonna pack my troubles in a big suitcase and dump 'em in the deep blue sea

Well then that ole sun it'll start to shine and I won't be blue no more
Well then I'll find myself a brand new love that's a what I'm longin' for
Well the loves I had they've made me sad left my heart swingin' from a tree
I'm gonna pack my troubles in a big suitcase and dump 'em in the deep blue sea
And dump them in the deep blue sea
