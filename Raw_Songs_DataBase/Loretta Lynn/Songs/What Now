If it's over between us what now can't forget you cause I don't know how
Oh what will I do where do I go from you if it's over between us what now
If my heart's been deserted what now can't I stop it from beating somehow
If there's no more you and I that I'll want to die if it's over between us what now
I keep asking where did our love go you won't tell me and I sure don't know
All I know is what's left is our love worse and dead if it's over between us what now
If it's over between us what now
