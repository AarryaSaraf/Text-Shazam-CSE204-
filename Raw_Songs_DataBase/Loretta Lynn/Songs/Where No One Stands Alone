Once I stood in the night with my head bowed low
In the darkness as black as the sea
And my heart was afraid and I cried
Oh Lord, don't hide your face from me

Hold my hand all the way, every hour of the day
From here to the great unknown
Take my hand, let me stand
Where no one stands alone

Like a king, I may live in a palace so tall
With great riches to call my own
But I don't know a thing in this whole wide world
That's worse than being alone

Hold my hand all the way, every hour of the day
From here to the great unknown
Take my hand, let me stand
Where no one stands alone
