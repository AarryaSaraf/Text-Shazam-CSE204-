Oh I can't live without you and I'm barely livin' with you
I can't get her off your mind and I can't set you free
When you look at one another your look tells me you love her
And that's the part that slowly killing me
Oh what's this other woman done to you she can't ever love you like I do
Cry tears enough to drown me heartache's closing in around me
And that's the part that slowly killing me

Oh what's this other woman done to you why she can't ever love you like I do
I'd die the night you leave me I cry but you don't see me
And that's the part that slowly killing me
Yes that's the part that slowly killing me
