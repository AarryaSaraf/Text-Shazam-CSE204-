Album: IntroBonito

// Bonito Intro //

こんにちは!
ケロケロボニトです。
Rock to the rhythm, jam to the beat

// Intro Bonito //

The perfect moment in history

Hey, you, take your headphones off
Toss your phone cause the beat is on
Dancing's better when you're with someone
But I guess you wouldn't know it if you're home alone
Kero Kero Bonito in the place
Bonito on the mic, Kero's on the bass
Hitting you with the international 楽しい sound
That will make the world get down

誰でも楽しめる
Come on everybody say "kero kero"
From the countryside to the concrete ghetto
音楽が嫌いでも
Come on everybody say "kero kero"

日本語で?
オッス おはよう こんにちは
これから始まるみんなでパーティー
抹茶 紅茶 飲み物ごちゃごちゃ
世界の果てまで飛んでいけ
ケロケロ?ってカエルは鳴くけど
僕たち三人だけだけど
この出会い 歴史に残るぜ

誰でも楽しめる
Come on everybody say "kero kero"
From the Mariana Trench to Mount Everest
音楽が嫌いでも
Come on everybody say "kero kero"
行こう let's go!

誰でも楽しめる
Come on everybody say "kero kero"
From the world wide web to the thoughts in your head
音楽が嫌いでも
Come on everybody say "kero kero"
もう1回!

誰でも楽しめる
Come on everybody say "kero kero"
From the milky way to outer space
音楽が嫌いでも
Come on everybody say "kero kero"
Turn up the bass on your speakers, because
For the next twenty-five minutes or so
You're gonna be jackin' to Bonito

// Sick Beat //

It's KKB! Let's go!
走って登って撃って跳んで
Tomb Raiderになりたいんだ
かっこ良くて強くて
憧れなんだTomb Raider
Windows 98, remember those days?
夢中になって遊んだevery day
誰にも負けない諦めない
自分に誓ったあのころnever fades
Time warp! I'm 22 years old
大人の世界に change over
秘境で嘘つき駆け引きfor money
Hard to keep up always stopping me but
忘れない逃げない絶対
あのころ自分 突き通せ
あの心 あのハート
1、2、3
進んでto the next level

Whichever console you play
No matter how many hours a day
I could win at any game
Whether you're a boy, or a girl, or a super computer
It's often said I should get some girly hobbies instead
But that thought fills me with dread
I'm not into sewing, baking, dress-making
Not eating, bitching, submitting

同じ色に染まらず
自分の道を歩むって
寂しいし 辛いし
いろんなこと言われるけど
出る釘は打たれるって
よく聞くよね この言葉
それならいっぱい打てばいい
I did it my way この人生

Whichever console you play
No matter how many hours a day
I could win at any game
Whether you're a boy, or a girl, or a super computer
It's often said I should get some girly hobbies instead
But that thought fills me with dread
I'm not into sewing, baking, dress-making
Not eating, bitching, submitting
Whichever console you play
No matter how many hours a day
I could win at any game
Whether you're a boy, or a girl, or a super computer
It's often said I should get some girly hobbies instead
But that thought fills me with dread
I'm not into sewing, baking, dress-maki--

// My Party //

I'm having a party
Everyone can come
By the way, you're invited
You seem pretty fun
I've got a massive sound system
Biggest in the world
DJ spins all the tunes
That will make you move

I don't need a reason to get down
But if it's your birthday you're still welcome to come 'round

My party
My party's on
My party's on
You gotta come
My party's on

You don't have to bring extra food
I've got it all laid out
Cake and jelly and ice cream
Enough for everyone
No matter what you're into
Or what you look like
Even if you don't know us
You're gonna have a good time

I don't need a reason to get down
But if you're getting married you're still welcome to come 'round

ぼくのおとり
My party, yeah
音楽スタートおどりだす
ここは crazy
みんな crazy
Let's get the party started now
飲んだり、食べたり、しゃべたり
わになてすわてる
あそこではビデオゲーム
ふうせんなげてみんなわらて

I don't need a reason to get down
So whether it's New Year's for you, you're welcome to come 'round

My party
My party's on
My party's on
You gotta come
My party's on
My party

I don't need a reason to get down
Now now now now now now now
Weekday, weekend, holiday you're welcome to come 'round

My party (hey!)
My party's on
My party's on
You gotta come
My party's on
My party
My party's on
My party's on
You gotta come
My party's on
My party's on

// Cat vs Dog //

Dog v. cat
You're canine trash
There's nothing I like more than a mutt getting whacked
With my baseball bat, how'd you like that?
That'll stop you barking, startling me in the morning
What's your problem, dog?
Cat got your tongue in the vice 'til the blood comes?
Hope your owner comes running cause he's lonesome
Bark any louder, I'll kill him for fun

Cat v. dog
It's all kicking off
I wanna murder moggies all around the world
I'll bite you in the head, 'til you're dead
Brains everywhere, but I won't care
I'll be hanging with my bitches enjoying the riches
Of a multi-sensory life
Man's best friend is a dog, not a feline
Homosapiens got one thing right

Eternal hatred

// Babies (Are So Strange) //

They can't even talk
And they keep us up
Cause they always want to suck
Babies are so strange
I guess we must love them very much
To put up with all that stuff

わかてるんだよじぶんが
女にうまねたってことが
ほんとつなんかこあくないも
まいじきまいじき見てるもん
だから何私だまじょてこと
せいりがあるからぜったやだ
にんしきむべったやだ
まだやりたいこといっぱいあるも

They can't even talk
And they keep us up
Cause they always want to suck
Babies are so strange
I guess we must love them very much
To put up with all that stuff

にんしんて簡単ゆけど
私にとってはこわすぎる
Just like the film Alien
おなかもなからとびでるよ
まだできないんだ
ゆめい keep up
すずけて行きたい
ゆめを keep up
そなにほしけりゅ自分でゆめが
Don't think so!

Everybody try to bite off your toes
And simultaneously touch your nose
I bet you look pretty stupid right now

They can't even talk
And they keep us up
Cause they always want to suck
Babies are so strange
I guess we must love them very much
To put up with all that stuff

Child-producing machine
That's what nature has designed me to be
Child-producing machine
I guess we'll see

// Bonito Jingle //

Yo, yo, yo
Pump it up DJ
ケロケロボニとのインターナショナル楽しいサウンドだよう
ケロケロボニと check it out
MP3 プレーヤー
まだとめちょだめ
これからだよう
ケロケロパーティー

// Homework //

Astronaut or a rock star
That's what I want to be
Or maybe a fireman, saving cats from trees
Mama says I can make it
I just have to work hard
Finish all of your homework
And then you will go far, will go far
(Hey!)

毎日毎日感じがちゅ
ノートに感じお連取するけど
じゅくひょびこかてきょうし
ひゃくてんまんてんとりだいから
だからでたいからここから
ぼくのきめられた人生
それがぼくの幸せ
もじょとさ almost there

And all my friends can join me in my pool
When I'm very successful
Cause I worked hard at school
You don't need to be jealous
Cause you can have this too
Finish all of your homework
And you will get rich soon, get rich soon
(Yeah!)
Oh no

Astronaut or a rock star
That's what I want-
Or maybe a fireman, saving-
Mama says I can make it
I just have to work hard
Finish all of your homework
And then you will go far, will go far
(Hey!)

// Pocket Crocodile //

Pocket crocodile
Hold him in your hand
Keep him warm and moist
He bites

僕の可愛いワニはいっぱい米食べる
僕の可愛いワニとずっと一緒だよ

Crocodile life span
Isn't very long
Even when he's gone
He loves you

// Cat vs Dog (Japanese Version) //

猫 V. 犬
この犬ゴミね
野球バットでうたれちまい
ぼくの一番おきにり
怖いだろうどかせるないよう
朝ほえるのやめるもんだいありますか?
ちがふきでるまでしたなくなれこしゅじんすはしてくるよ
ほいてみろよろこんでころしちゃうぞ

犬 V. 猫
けんかじょうと世界じゅの猫ほむるぞ
しぬまであたまかみつくぞう
のみそいちねんかんけんないし
なかまといっしょうにいわうぞいっぱい
人間の友達それはいぬで猫じゃない
そさこれはホモセピアンの世界さ

いっしょきらい

// Park Song //

ブランコつよくこげば
いつかいしゅできるはず
すなばひしにほれば
明日にはブラジルさ
ここはぼくの公園だ
すべりだいのぼてやる
つかまえるざ
きょうこそぜったい
ストプ
Stop the pager now

When the sun is out I leave the house
And head down to the park
But never after dark
Cause that's when the monsters come out to play
I could spend all day on the climbing frame
Just being who I want
The cool kids reach the top
But I would rather enjoy myself

三人ねころだて
時間がすぎるのながめてた
雲のかたちょうあたて
自分のおもいにふけてた
もブランコにはのらないけども
すなやまはつくらない
けどすべりだいものもらない
でも公園にはまだ行くよ

When the sun is out I leave the house
And head down to the park
But never after dark
Cause that's when the monsters come out to play
I could spend all day on the climbing frame
Just being who I want
The cool kids reach the top
But I would rather enjoy myself

Are you going?
(Come on, come on)
It takes two to see-saw
Are you chicken?
(I'm not, I'm not)
It beats staying at home
And I go round and round and round...

When the sun is out I leave the house

I could spend all day on the climbing frame

But I would rather enjoy myself

Are you going?
It take's two to see-saw

こげこそぜまだいくよぱ
It beats staying at home

// Let's Go To The Forest //

Hey, let's all go into the forest
Nobody will notice for a while
There we can visit all the creatures
Maybe they can teach us facts of life

Or we can travel to the ocean
Don't forget your lotion
It's quite hot
I once met seven lovely crabs
They said I should go back and join them for tea

Oh wait, the forest got demolished
When they built the airport years ago
But we can still go see the ocean
Cause they put it in a bowl at the mall

// Small Town //

Small town, what to get around
Everybody's safe and sound
'Cause the action's happening somewhere else
There are a few shops
One that sells lots
Special supermarket deals
Can be quite fun
If there's nothing else to do

And I would like to fly away
Around here everybody knows my name (You're Sarah)
And they all think I am so strange
Because I don't look quite the same

The bus doesn't come much
Never on holidays
And the station's several miles out
So we all stay in drinking cups of tea
Watching T.V. until it's lights out

And I would like to fly away
Around here everybody knows my name
And they all think I am so strange
Because I don't look quite the same

だとかえり森をぬけて
いつもの芭蕉にいくけと
空は青で私は緑
自分でいったいなんだろ
風にのてとんでけば
きっといつかわかるはず
なごや、おたる、Kenilworth, London
すぎはどこに KKB?

And I would like to fly away
Around here everybody knows my name
And they all think I am so strange
Because I don't look quite the same
Because I don't look quite the same
Because I don't look quite the same
(Because I don't look quite the same)

// I'd Rather Sleep //

I feel so funny these days
I'd rather sleep than stay awake
Trees used to talk to me
Now I know what's real and what is fake
Now I know what's real, what's fake
Rather sleep than stay awake

Are we from outer space?
This doesn't feel like the right place
And we'll try anything
Just to be a kid once again
Just to be a kid again

Now I know what's real, what's fake
Rather sleep than stay awake
Just to be a kid again
