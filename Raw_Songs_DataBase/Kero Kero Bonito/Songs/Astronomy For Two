I take this route at night
Cause at certain times
It's exposed in the moonlight
But my ring is sublime
I'm taken by surprise
By some acquaintance of mine

Pretending to remember
Though secretly I know
We did business a long time ago
We trade pleasantries even though

I don't mean a thing to you
I see the way you move
(The way you move)
Cause I move like that too
When I'm confused
Your stories don't mean shit to me
I'm sorry that sounds crude
(That sounds crude)
But I could tell the truth
Now that would be rude

So it's up and up and up
And it guilts me
So with the chance to part
We turn our heels and walk
In different directions
And as our footsteps fade
I'm stricken by the thought
''We're just the same, oh god''

All of the floor with our knee above
You're moving fast but your mind is slow
Bouncing it down through the streets at night
Fixing all that the high was rolled back
The sun's gone and it ain't coming back
The city life got a music track

And sometimes I remember why it was
We did business a long time ago
I'd love to stay in touch even though

I don't mean a thing to you
I see the way you move
(The way you move)
Cause I move like that too
When I'm confused
Your stories don't mean shit to me
I'm sorry that sounds crude
(That sounds crude)
But I could tell the truth
Now that would be rude
Oh oh oh

Now that would be rude
Oh oh oh
Now that would be rude
Oh oh oh
Now that would be rude
Oh oh oh oh oh
Now that would be rude

Oh, this is the way I cry alone
Oh oh
