I came here
In control of my life
'Cause I thought
Everything was alright

Oh you talk (no)
We talk without action baby
Though you said you liked my watch
Just before asking what my star sign was
Then I heard you later say
That those who use horoscopes
Should get a therapist around
Do they wear your glasses
With those
Feathers hanging down

Now I'm no economist but I could tell you
Something's wrong with this trade off
But likewise I don't know
What I'm talking about
No I don't

A single teardrop
Falls from my eye
But I'm kind of hoping
That we are not pretending
Anymore

The badges have been traded
So I guess its time to go
And yet we take the same route
What a wonderful coincidence
Though you don't hear me complaining
In fact I'm happy
To be a contact on your phone
I guess that's some kind of action
I hope you rescue me quite soon

I came here
In control of my life
'Cause I thought
Everything was alright
But it's not

A single teardrop
Falls from my eye
But I'm kind of hoping
That we are not pretending
Anymore
And what do you say to that
I'm not sure what she meant with that touch
But then I think about these things too much
So maybe love is not the answer
