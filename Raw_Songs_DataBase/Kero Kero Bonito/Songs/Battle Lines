Know the nation you keep
Identify and feed them their grief
Cut them off from the people
Take each cell and repeat
Assign their trouble to the unseen
Then protected, you'll be

Make dull chaos the rule
Reduce their spirits and you'll find soon
They'll be too weak to fight you
By the will of God our power is total
Fake a disaster state
The enemy will make itself plain

For in a world that never takes a form
The battle lines are gone
And war is always on, somehow
But we are all the soldiers, now

I see blood in my dreams
A beaten face, the gas
The streets, a screen

So we shall do our mothers proud
If we are all the soldiers, now

I surrender, and I relinquish all my weapons
We together, are terrifying, asking a question
I surrender, and I relinquish all my weapons
We together, are terrifying, asking a question

I know what I wanna go get
And I ain't gonna make it complicated
We lay down the law in this place
So you don't need to save us
I know what I wanna go get
And I ain't gonna make it complicated
We lay down the law in this place
So you don't need to say
