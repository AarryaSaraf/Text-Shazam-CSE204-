Oh, ooh, oh
High up in a chamber
She painted pictures of the man that made her
Oh, ooh, oh
Shadowed by a clock face
The hands were rusted at the time she came in

When she played outside
She saw the birds, so high
But she made a wish
To grow, one day, her own pair of wings

She sailed long from the fall
To find herself in the world
When in the wind, she heard a burning call
And so she followed it and came ashore
On the beach with a crowd all waiting here for you
Then a voice said, "It was true
We all prayed for a princess
You're the one, heaven sent"

Oh, ooh, oh
High up in the chamber
She painted pictures of the man that made her
Oh, ooh, oh
Just to remember
Before the memory got lost in the dark
Oh, ooh, oh
Shadowed by a clock face
The hands were rusted at the time she came in
Though she shrugged the passing of the days
Eternally a child she would remain

But while she flies like the wind
The air escaped into silence
She woke up laying on a gilded bed
With half a dozen maids around her
"We're keeping you safe in a tall place
Where you can see all imagining for miles
By God's decree
Hail to the girl, our Queen"

As the nights ran
Together blurring into years
Her brush strokes never disappeared

Oh, ooh, oh
High up in the chamber
She painted pictures of the man that made her
Oh, ooh, oh
Just to remember
Before the memory got lost in the dark
Oh, ooh, oh
Shadowed by a clock face
The hands were rusted at the time she came in
Though she shrugged the passing of the days
Eternally a child she would remain

Until one day when the clatter rang through the hills
They found my call in the smashed open windowsill
A feather high in the air
And the once-stopped clock was ticking on
