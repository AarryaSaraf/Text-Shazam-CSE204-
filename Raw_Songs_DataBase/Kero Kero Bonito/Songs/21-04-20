Out of bed just after one
Don't have time to catch the sun
All the bugs are at their business
And the flowers are in bloom
We take a note of their perfume
Underneath the pale spectre of the moon
And I just stand there waiting
Getting my sunbeams

Last night's pasta in a tub
Out the fridge for lunch and breakfast
But as I sit down to eat
I hear a song riding the breeze
Happy birthday to Eloise
Their mom and dad both let out a cheer
They're gonna throw a party another year
And I should take a walk for a bit

As I head up the road
A private ambulance zooms off into the distance
In silence, all the shops are closed
With rainbows painted on the glass
Covering notes that they hope to see us soon
But right now there's not much they can do
I dodge a jogger or two

Back at home, I'm playing a game
Rewatch repeats, I set a call up with a friend
A means towards an end, 'til we can meet again
"Hey, so, how are you doing?"
"I'm okay, you know, the usual kinda weird"

So we animate the cosmos, darken our minds
Eventually the song heralds the dawn
I can't stifle my yawns
I make my bed up after I floss
And tuck in tightly
For a new day
