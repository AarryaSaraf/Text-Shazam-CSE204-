And we usher our children into the shade
In the warm summer silence suspended aloft in the air
There a cricket sings alone
Ancient songs of home
Where now

The Sun's returned to send us home to Earth
Everybody takes their time making work to do-do-do-do
But no one will be left here to remember us
When the fires come
When the fires come
When the fires come
