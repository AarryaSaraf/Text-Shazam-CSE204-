I see you, you only hear me
But you know we're the same after all
We face monotony
We feel the need to belong, so baby
Why aren't you dancing with someone?
All you know is all you see
At midnight you see everything
Simply release your mind
Seek some what kind find you
Ready to keep on dancing through the night?
We all need to shake this hatred
I get up when I'm feeling down
Some stay against the wall
Trying to retain their cool
They ask me, why are you dancing with such force?
(Oooh oooh yeaah yeaaah)
(Oooh oooh yeaah yeaaah)
Sun rises as we predicted
DJ Gus with a tear in his eye
I feel I've lost something stepping outside
And I wonder, why aren't you dancing anymore?
