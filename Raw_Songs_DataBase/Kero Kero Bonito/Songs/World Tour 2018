Bring everyone you ever loved
And if you've seen us before
Then you know we put on a good show

Packing with 
Let's party together

Whatever the way

We're going on a world tour
Bring everyone you ever loved
And if you've seen us before
Then you know we put on a good show

All you need is a time and a place
To hide your diary, so don't be late
With a kick-drum, even a bass
We'll all be waiting for you 

We're going on a world tour
Bring everyone you ever loved
And if you've seen us before

We'll bring plenty
We'll bring plenty of friends
