If you like to go places (Okay!)
Pick your favorite and build it up
As big as you want it
Don't forget to put your own flag on top
And when it gets boring
It's more fun to go knock it down
But then you got nothing
And it's time to turn your life around

This house is pink in the front
Flowers in the back (Connecting blocks!)
I'll change your hair if I want
Even if it's a hat
You see the frog in the stairs
He's made out of bricks (The bricks are green!)
And I can make a nice bridge as well

Taimumachin te, let's go!
Nanamane mai Nippon, yeah
Dorai monga oshaiete kureta
Dare mo ira kera ii jan
So build it up, build it up
Bokutachi no yuutata yo
Mai tachi mai tachi mai tachi te
Yuu kara dame nanda

I built a town over there
They are holding flags (With both their hands!)
And there's a solar device
Coming out of a bench
But there's a problem I have
I can't build a car (Why can't you build?)
Cause all my tires are on the boat

Airport
A cathedral
And a theme park
And a sweater from your grandma
Karaoke
And a sauce pan
As in Newton's laws of motion
Independence
Have a biscuit
Always put your best foot forward
Why are we all here

Bang!
Tokuhatsu te that's okay nanamane
Kyoryu wa namane
So knock it down, knock it down
Onokaku head on back to the future
Let's make this super duper dinosaur
Nyo ki o tsukero
Help me to decide where to build it up
