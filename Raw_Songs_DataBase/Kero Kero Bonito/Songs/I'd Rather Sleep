I feel so funny these days
I'd rather sleep than stay awake
Trees used to talk to me
Now I know what's real and what is fake
Now I know what's real, what's fake
Rather sleep than stay awake

Are we from outer space?
This doesn't feel like the right place
And we'll try anything
Just to be a kid once again
Just to be a kid again

Now I know what's real, what's fake
Rather sleep than stay awake
Just to be a kid again
