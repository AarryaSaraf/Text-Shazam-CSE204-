Holy mother
Receive our hearts in your arms
And let our souls pass
The day the rain returns again
Holy mother
Receive our hearts in your arms
And let our souls pass
The day the rain returns again

We pass down our wisdom
After sunshine comes thunder
The longer the drought
The heavier the clouds

Collecting water in glass
Counting the days against the crops that last, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
A dwarf shoot yawns at the sky
Daring a stratonimbus in the vicinity to spit on it

When Earth is submerging
And heaven is open
The river will carry all of us
To where we belong

But then a shadow is cast
Over the fields, a shower first
Then a torrent crashes down
Releasing the jungle swelling in the ground
And as was foretold, our time is out

Holy mother
Receive our hearts in your arms
And let our souls pass
The day the rain returns again
Holy mother
Receive our hearts in your arms
And let our souls pass
The day the rain returns again
Holy mother
Receive our hearts in your arms
And let our souls pass
The day the rain returns again
Holy mother
Receive our hearts in your arms
And let our souls pass
The day the rain returns again

We pass down our wisdom
After sunshine comes thunder
The longer the drought
The heavier the clouds

When Earth is submerging
And heaven is open
The river will carry all of us
To where we belong
And no-one shall be left over
(Where we belong)
For the river's too strong
(Where we belong)
I trust mother to know
(Where we belong)
So watch the raindrops
