Do the sneaker dance
Show the whole world your swag
Our shoes like exercise
Even when they look nice
Do the sneaker dance
Dance as hard as you can
A true blue sneaker fan
Ain't scared of no scratch

If you go down to the shops
Then you might bump into
A squirrel, a dog and a croc
It's the famous Benchmates
The dog's called Lakeith
The nervy blue fella with the braced up teeth
When he sees a nice shoe
There's a routine that he has to do
He stomp stomp stomps
His feet
He doesn't hold back he ignores the beat
Then he jump jump jumps really high
Letting his laces fly

Do the sneaker dance
Show the whole world your swag
Our shoes like exercise
Even when they look nice
Do the sneaker dance
Dance as hard as you can
A true blue sneaker fan
Ain't scared of no scratch

No scratch
'Cos scratches build up character

Ms Crocodile sticks with her kid
She believes in attachment parenting
Her shoes are way too big
But she pads them out so they fit
Mr Squirrel has no such issue
His look mirrors his ambition
With a scarf of finest wool
'Cos he's always feeling cool
But he harbours a curious secret
He's followed by a spirit creature
That only he can hear
Whose words echo in his ears

Do the sneaker dance
Show the whole world your swag
Our shoes like exercise
Even when they look nice
Do the sneaker dance
Dance as hard as you can
A true blue sneaker fan
Ain't scared of no scratch

So stomp stomp stomp
Your feet
Don't hold back just ignore the beat
Jump jump jump
Really high
Letting those laces fly
Stomp stomp stomp
Your feet
Don't hold back just ignore the beat
Jump jump jump
Really high
Letting those laces fly

Do the sneaker dance
Dance as hard as you can
