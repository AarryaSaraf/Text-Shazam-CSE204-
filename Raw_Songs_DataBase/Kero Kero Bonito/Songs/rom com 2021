You used to see
Lovers embracing making tracks in the snow
Contrarily
All of my winter strolls are taken alone

What does it say about me?
That I'd rather die in your arms than
Watch you move on without me
Being the one in your heart
And what would you think

If I wanted to be yours like no one else before
I need you to see
That you make me crazy like no one else could be
And baby I'm yours
If you're crazy for me

A country escape
Fine young things
Isolophobia
Two-timed
I don't wanna know
Well actually I do
Soul reawakening
Love is all we have

If I wanted to be yours like no one else before
I need you to see
That you make me crazy like no one else could be
And baby I'm yours
If you're crazy for me
If I wanted to be yours like no one else before
I need you to see
That you make me crazy like no one else could be
And baby I'm yours

If you're crazy for me
