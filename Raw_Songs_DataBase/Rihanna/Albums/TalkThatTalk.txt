// Cockiness (Love It) //

Suck my cockiness, lick my persuasion
Eat my words and then swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs over your resistance
And then you come around, you come around, you come around

I want you to be my sex slave
Anything that I desire
Be one with my femin-ay
Set my whole body on fire
Fair maiden Rihannagate
Taking over your empire
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'm gonna be the queen of your body parts

No one can do you the way that I do
Boy, I want (You)

I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it

Suck my cockiness, lick my persuasion
Eat my words and then swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs over your resistance
And then you come around, you come around, you come around

I can be your dominatrix
Just submit to my every order
Enter my diamond matrix
If you want my golden flower
Make me your priority
Place nothing above my pleasure
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'm gonna be the queen of your body parts

No one can do you the way that I do
Boy, I want (You)

I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it

I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it

Hold it down, beat it like a bully
Beat my drum, drum, like a drum line boogie (I love it when you)
Dive head first if you wanna
Sing to my body, hold me tight Mr. Lover (I love it when you)
Do it like I do it, like I said
Keep it up, boy, we can do this all day
Be my Harlem and me St. Tropez
Never found nobody that will do it this way

No one can do you the way that I do
Boy, I want (You)

I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it

// Farewell //

Wherever you're going
I wanna go
Wherever you're headed
Can you let me know?
Don't mind catching up
I'm on my way
Just can't take the thought of you miles away

And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life
I hope that you'll find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know it'll be sadder
If you never hit the road

So farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody's me

I will write to tell you what's going on
But you won't miss nothing but the same old song
If you don't mind catching up
I'll spend the day telling you stories about a land far away
But I know

And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life (Oh)
I hope that you'll find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know it'll be sadder
If you never hit the road

So farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
Farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody's me

And I'm gon' try to hold it all in
Try to hold back my tears
So it don't make you stay here, yeah

// Fool In Love //

Mama, I found a man
Who loves me and understands
Papa, he's quite a man
He adores me, he's my biggest fan
And don't get me wrong
I know he's not perfect in your eyes
But somehow he's flawless in mine

And you may tell me to run, run now
But I can't do that
We're too far down the hole
He's got a hold on my soul

So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
'Til I've had enough
Mama, don't judge me now
I'm not trying to hurt you
I know this won't make you proud
Papa, did I let you down?
Are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?

You'll see a monster
I see a smile
You say it's danger
And I'm in denial
But somehow I feel so safe right now

So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
'Til I've had enough

// We Found Love (Extended Mix) //

Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Shine a light through an open door
Love a life I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
