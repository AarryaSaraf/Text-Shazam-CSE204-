// 2x Pills //

Yo, ah
That shit like that, er
Yeah

Two pills and a Mac-11, red, blue, you choose
Tryna spit a few flows to get my money up
Look I'm 20 years old and I ain't done enough
And 'til the sun set, roll another blunt for my real nigga Kembe
I'm not only the leader but I follow the village
I swear them niggas is killing it in Chicago
Now put the gun down, waiting to put the world on 'em
I get tired of the problems and depression
The bitches and the bitching, come and get your girl, homie
Shallow dreams and broken hearts, Black Benz's
They're tryna make, material wishes and spiritual blisses
They stay focused on inferior pictures, you got your mothafuckin' hands out

I hid so, so far away, so far away
But I still, I still hear the gun sounds
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang

Two kills from a Mac-11, red and blue, you lose
A nigga need bail so get your money out
I'm twenty years old and I ain't done enough
Lord, I swear I got the answers for my people
And bullets bring the reaper
I heard my first lie in a church from a preacher
I sank low cause that's where they want to keep us
Just give me love, give me sex, give me reefer
And after school getting high with the teachers
I tried to promise my momma I'd make it honest
Say what's on your heart I promise they call it conscience
And conscious don't make no dollars, no dollars unless you Common
Now get your mothafuckin' hands out

I hid so, so far away, so far away
But I still, I still hear the gun sounds
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang
Bang, bang-bang, bang-bang

// Dawg House //

Ain't got no coup
But park mine

// Gil //

Late nights, stay on it
Bright lights, they want it
And it's funny how you so charismatic
A sex addict, but stay lonely
Throw a beat on, I kill it
Not a gun though, my feelings
Here comes slow, pop pilling
And I die young, God willing
God willing, shit
Got me over here tripping
And liquor don't help for the feelings I felt
I'm just over here chilling
Yeah, always seem to blame a bitch
The only thing I got is my pain and shit
And these hoes want art
Love over your canvases
Should I talk about my dad or something?
Always feel like I'm mad for nothing
Rap fast cause a crash is coming
And it hurts for the words but it lasts for something
Po Pimpin' so Do or Die
Slit wrists, so suicidal
Stay cool in a pool of fire
Worship in a verse, nigga who's your idol?
Ain't never felt like this before
Would you ride for freedom? Would you die for freedom?
Got a ski mask on and a pistol loaded
Hear money talking, I die to meet 'em
Looking forward to the bright lights
Late nights and the bullshit
Yeah, they was talking that good shit
That's far as they could get, yeah

// Grace //

One more time
Got some hoes
Got some hoes that read between the lines
I-, yeah
Got some hoes that read between the lines
I like smoking weed, I like that
I dream like three year old
Got my-, I like-
Yeah, yeah

I got some hoes that read between the lines
I like smoking weed, I like that, I dream like three year old
With my diamond teeth, I don't need no bitch to hold me down
I got more to see, got my sapphire 'focals on me now
No more monsters swarmin' round

DMT, I like to pound
It's my momma turn
Let me strike some rule, and you a fool
Are you down to burn?
Are you-are you down to hold it too?
Are you down to learn?
All my niggas know was Chattanoo'
Hand me down the shirt
I come from-I come from where you goin'
Where them bitches at? Where them bitches at?
Is that your Henn'? Let me finish that
Hoe, you know I'm good as granny food
Bring my nigga back
Rakim, don't you down that 100 proof
We just chillin', Jack, got 'em poppin' on a new terrain
On them bitches face
I could fuck her, flip her, to a Benz
With my better rims
They don't make no fuckin' picket line
For your cousin, then
You might catch me prayin' for some J
For some better rims

I got some hoes that read between the lines
I like smoking weed, I like that, I dream like three year old
With my diamond teeth, I don't need no bitch to hold me down
I got more to see, got my sapphire 'focals on me now
No more monsters swarmin' round
No more monsters swarmin' round

And just a reminder, regardless, you know you're special, yeah
So fuck the Matrix, the pineal, and phony vessels, yeah
We are the 'niners, we brought you a bowl for breakfast, yeah
I'm glad your offer is often, like, sacrificial, yeah
And oh my God, it's a God, I should never 'fessed it, yeah
Like can you call me, I'm fallin', I need a blessin', yeah
I never heard ya, I'm worried, I think you're human, yeah
I see you bleedin', you need me, I never knew ya, but
But bust it wide, when you visit me
Hoe, at least you know that it's Rashad
Over everything, now I got the world, but I was fine
With some Dairy Queen, I might fuck her, flip her, it's a line
'Till they bury me, guess what happened on that new terrain
In the better place, I can't choose between this medicine
And some better friends, thought we found the truth but then we lost
All the evidence, hold my Gucci, baby, don't get lost
In the Edison
Baby, Gucci, baby, hol' up

I like to smoke
Medicine, man
Lost, everything
Lost, Edison
I like to smoke

// Howistarted //

Young nigga can't love no more, pussy ass niggas
Broke over 28 grams
Who the fuck and what the fuck we 'spose to do with it?
My brother used to ride the bucket with the tube in it
Six-12's, heard you trapping with a mean soundtrack
Do you need some bubble, do you drink?
Man, my uncle was a cool slick walker
Don't be backin' away
The Benz that he wanted got him back in the race
I feel like I shouldn't put it back in your face
But here is the motherfucking bat at the bass
And steer in the motherfucking lack of the day
I'm cracking the case, as Johnny would say
From babies, your liquor bottle would pop if it's me
Your topic was hella bogus, you fucking with everybody
I see how you over do it
I knew my idol was inferior, I just needed something to believe huh

Saw the fist go up, but the shit goes down on the Westside, ooh
Saw the fist go up, but the shit goes down on the Westside, ooh
Saw the fist go up, but the shit goes down on the Westside, ooh
Saw the fist go up, but the shit goes down on the Westside, ooh

Quit tripping, you don't feel like paper
Talk like money, these days niggas intervene like bitches
12 know he was at the green light twitching
Praying that I got a balanced beam my nigga
Looking like I got a balanced beam my nigga
Maybe it was me, I was running to the east side
Touched down, looking like I made one
These days, these hoes caught you, fishing for a baller
Bitch I never wanna go to 'Winnett lake
And I never reminisce about my old shit
I guess I figured from the signs, them bitches did a line
And then them bitches did some more shit
I should've caught it on film, but most won't believe us
Fuck 'em, can you keep a secret? I'mma keep it for myself
Wonder why your mission always fucking up the mood
Wonder why your mission-

Saw the fist go up, but the shit goes down on the Westside, ooh
Saw the fist go up, but the shit goes down on the Westside, ooh
Saw the fist go up, but the shit goes down on the Westside, ooh
Saw the fist go up, but the shit goes down on the Westside, ooh

// I Mean //

I feel so dirty when I pitch it right
I make you nervous, how I get you right
Yeah, ay

I feel so dirty when I pitch it right, yeah
I make you nervous, how I get you right, yeah
I think my hoe might be the preacher wife, yeah
I mean my hoe might be the sneaky type, yeah

I heard you up and on that overkill, yeah
You prolly dump me when I'm over here, yeah
Yeah, I might quit poppin' for my mama, for my, yeah
Yeah, I had a double with a donut, out in Dublin
Tell a bitch talk dirty to my other head
Yeah, the prison wall or water fountain with the liquor call
If them bitches call, I'm the rhetoric
Yeah, I got to quit fucking with that medicine
Guilt trips give me stiff lips and a pair of kids
This my enemy, this my bro, this my other bitch
What you want to do? On the real, this some gutter shit
So-Cal, cutter, I smile for the fuck of it
East side nigga, Chat-town with no funnel cake
Ink pen got me more Benz than my brother make
Resonate, put that Phen away, let me elevate
Thank God for my bank card and my get-a-way
That's a cool bitch, where's my dog, this the other day
That's a cool bitch, where's my dog, this the other day
Living dude, pimpin', are you down? Are you hungry?
Oh, say it loud, tell your friends I got 100 dick
Dudes who done had the worst time be the funniest
Back when they call me Akon, I was running shit
Vision is, 60-40 something, but I'm kickin' it
Wait, I was taught as to live, it's only pimpin' bitch
You just get it and live, and watch the chemistry
Look, now, found me a pill, I got another string
Blacked out, tripping again, and met another me

All by myself, I felt ashamed
Please bring me down
Please bring me down
All by myself, I felt ashamed
Please bring me down
Please bring me down

I need the white walls, white halls
Where it ain't that hard to be myself
Thank God, thank God
I'm here, I'm home
I need the white walls, the white halls
Where it ain't that hard to be myself
Thank God, thank God
I'm here, I'm home
I need the white walls, white walls

Got me feelin like please bring me down
Please bring me down
I need the white walls, white walls
Please bring me down

Bitch you know you can't parallel park anyway

We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one
Cause they gone do you wrong, and they gon' play you out
Alright, alright, alright
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one
Cause they gone do you wrong, and they gon' play you out
Alright, alright, alright

Back when my brother sold crack and my sister was a real one
Always was a real one
Saw you workin' early, tell me how you feel, huh?
Baby what's your hurry, get it how you live, huh?
Baby what's your name?, I've been goin' through a lot
I can't do this on my own, got no place to go Rashad
And that's a long way
Hey they gone love you when you're hot
They won't miss you when you gone if you're looking for a spot
That's the wrong way

But we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one
Cause they gone do you wrong, and they gon' play you out
Alright, alright, alright
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one
Cause they gone do you wrong, and they gon' play you out
Alright, alright, alright

Back when my sister sold hair
Heard you lookin' for the deal huh, get it how you live huh
Damn you caught me splurgin', lookin' for the real ones
If I make it early, get it for the little ones
I can see your pain, hope my voice is helping out
Hope your momma workin' out, she won't even come out the house
Heard she had a surgery, granny died before the drop
I don't like to visit home, I don't like to see the drought
Call me when you steppin' out, I might bring the cup with me
I might play the "Back and Forth", on my '94 Aali
We can split a O or three, this is how it's supposed to be
Like we had a better trial, fuck the jury, fuck with me

We on our own huh, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one
Cause they gone do you wrong, and they gone play you out
Alright
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one
Cause they gone do you wrong, and they gone play you out
Alright, alright, alright
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one
Cause they gone do you wrong, and they gone play you out
Alright

// The Basement //

I got the screw and the blunt
I got the good energize
I got the Blue Face, two A's, hoo-ray, never complacent
Love me, more me, for me, plus out the base, shit (yeah, yeah)
Since when, good raps, made home, now out the basement

Yeah, yay, Soul
Took my time with this shit
Turned my time into dinners
Turned my soul into gold
Turned my winters to winning
But see this winning ain't easy
Winning turned me to sinning
Turned that bottle to venting
Now my venting been spilling
All these lyrics so soulful
Turn these hoes into women
But sometimes women no fun
So tell those bitches what's up
And bitches turn me polygamous
Now my girl she ain't into it
Say this industry changed me
Could be right
See she knew me from straight out the basement
Now I done shapeshift
Used to be gracious
Look at the spaceship

Yeah, okay, okay, okay
The v hit was close up
Costa La No Stress
Four eyes, I'm juggling no job
I'm saving up protons
There's platinum in both sides
It happens in no time
My nigga was co-pi...
It's lo-fi, at your spot the do' knock

Okay okay, but please don't walk into my crib
Without some screw and some blunts
All my hoes into jazz see
Some of my women hood, but pretend to be classy
I'm allergic to bullshit
You can't sneak nothing passed me
I got the screw and the blunt
I got the good energize
I got the Blue Face, two A's, hoo-ray, never complacent
Love me, more me, for me, plus out the base, shit
Since when, good raps, made home, now out the basement

Now everything I do is made you's break
Mastered my pump fake
Can't tell weather my nose went numb or the funk fake
Vomit out my conscious on ya any given Sunday
If you in the huddle, you know we already won, uhh
Ten toes permanent to the cement
My peace forever, me and my demons made an agreement
And talk ours ways on clearance, but silence is still the cheapest
My promises resemble a rental, I rarely keep it, uhh
Sleeper cell, sleeper agent, people's favorite crazy child
From where violence tend to come with shots, uh, flagrant foul
They want pure, are coming from the same heart they defile
I'm about to- I'm about to break it down
Wait, somebody knocking

Okay okay, but please don't walk into my crib
Without some screw and some blunts
All my hoes into jazz see
Some of my women hood, but pretend to be classy
I'm allergic to bullshit
You can't sneak nothing passed me
I got the screw and the blunt
I got the good energize
I got the Blue Face, two A's, hoo-ray, never complacent
Love me, more me, for me, plus out the base, shit
Since when, good raps, made home, now out the basement

// The Race (Freestyle) //

Yeah, this for free, you been tryna get a plate (free lunch)
You ain't smokin', you just lookin' for an 8th (uh uh)
How you ballin' if you ain't got the skates? (Ain't got the skates)
I've been nuttin' on this bitch from the Bay (from the Bay)
Sellin' out, bring my friends, you my dawg (my dawg)
Fill my fronto like an arm in the cigar (the cigar)
If I don't smoke before I eat then I'ma starve (then I'ma starve)
I throw that platinum on my teeth when I'm with y'all
Preacher man, Mr. Willie, put some hands on my dinner
Put some eyes on my back, let me scope out these niggas
You a nobody, ain't nobody to nobody, nigga
I'ma quit when a bitch suck the flow out a nigga, uh
What's the word? I'm just tryna get a zip (amen)
But your plug always talkin' out my ear (amen)
At the window tryna hop up in the VIP (amen)
Swear you niggas be more thirsty than your bitch
Broke hoes always tryna tell me what I should do
With this change that I make and this groove that I grew
This your broad on the phone, this that raw on the phone
It's expensive and tucked, what's the brand? I don't know
Ain't concerned with that shit, too concerned with this grip
L.A. bitches only wanna sniff the coke off the tip
We can chill, you can hang like a rope off the dick
Celebrate, bring up dope, bring some pour out this bitch

Fuck a Vine, I'm just tryna get some face (amen)
Soon as I beat the face, bitch I did the race (amen)
Bust a nut, then I go out my way (go out my way)
Get the guap, then I go out my way (go out my way)

Yeah, go out my
Amen, ayy
See how I picked up the headphone jack and just kept goin'?

// Why Worry //

Too busy livin' big
Too busy checkin' of my list of shit I never did
Drop top on all my whips
Ain't none these hoes my bitch
Ain't none these hoes my gig
Can't even hold my piss
Oh, that's your family, yo man?
When? How could you stand 'em?
He always try take advantage of a nigga
There the mink is
Bills paid for the shrink is
Lay back and calm your thinkin'
Ink pens, ink blot, I'm sinkin'
Sober so far and shrinkin'
Smokin' out my new Lincoln
Baby

Yeah, yeah, dollar signs in the mornin'
Where the fonk at?
Follow me, yeah
With all that money on your head
Bet it's trackers on your phone
Yeah, follow me, yeah, wayment
GPS another spot
Where the fonk at?
Uh, follow me, huh, yeah
With all that money on your head
Bet it's trackers on your phone
Yeah, follow me

What about our friendship, what about our kinship?
Pullin' up like uncles, chonkin' out my window
Worried 'bout my M's and my new utensils
Ho, just be gentle when we swervin' that, this ain't a rental
I got a blindfold when I'm aimin' that with no specifics
Now life is? For those who spite me with them false advices
Bootleggin' my CD, talkin' 'bout you bunkin', talkin' like you ballin'
Talkin' 'bout you got it, pattin' on my pocket
Bitch, know I know you
From frozens and black soap operas
My mob is slim as my goddess
You can't reach the top and everybody
I got things in order, who important
You ain't Uncle Bobby, or my cousin Risha
Please don't lean on me, bitch, I'm vibin'
Please don't pretend, can't depend on me
But bitch I got it, I'm on fire
You so Shang Tsung like, you switch like on lights
For all the chrome right, I'm gone and won't write
My perch and dome right, I'm in my zone right
Oh, he good, drop-top my Lincoln
Fuck I was thinkin'? (Oh, we should) Ayy, ayy

Yeah, yeah, dollar signs in the mornin'
Where the fonk at?
Follow me, yeah
With all that money on your head
Bet it's trackers on your phone
Yeah, follow me, yeah, wayment
GPS another spot
Where the fonk at?
Uh, follow me, huh, yeah
With all that money on your head
Bet it's trackers on your phone
Yeah, follow me

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Me
