Is there a Heaven? (Yes)
How do you know that? (You don't)

Yeah, yeah
I hope it all makes sense to ball like this, the large address
Ain't nothing stoppin' me but parking fees
Many hands settle down
If you don't ever get yourself straight, who the fuck is you gon' help, main?
I pray for many Thanksgivings, I pray that Tisha don't cook
You know her mama'll put sugar in they greens
That's that shit I never seen before
Bucket list, scratchin' off some shit you ain't never dreamed before
Sparkle up your pinky toe
Ayy, baby, I have no reason to stay, baby
My dream too big for this city
And Myrtle Beach ain't vacation
I can't go far as Nevada, say I only seen Vegas
If not these niggas, bet your senses betray ya
I need a day or
Two hoes plottin' on my cellular phone
I'm on speed dial, I'm your favorite problem, ya bitch smokin'
Meanwhile, went and got my tolerance thick
With that Stephen Curry arm reach
Oh, we always on top

Slip and slide, I'm out of here, inside the whip
A thousand years, a thousand year
I want my payback
It's all for you, baby, yeah
And slip and slide, I'm out of here, inside the whip
A thousand years, a thousand year
I want my payback
It's all for you, baby, yeah

Your face was blizzard, are you numb enough again?
How I sang it with that purple Power Ranger in my Benz
It's a Jeep, but I'm gon' get it
I'm still Rocem when I visit
Don't you dig into it deeper than that prophet, this is sinners
It's a long time comin'
Somehow, I always keep it peaceful when my kumbuya hunnids
Always looking for a good time, Sunny, that just my first name
Don't holler 'bout your father incentive, it's just a birthday
And a warning for repeatin' a cycle would be the worst way
Them hoes always callin' my number like it's a jersey
Them hoes always treatin' my Johnson like he a person
No matter what could happen, what happened to havin' purpose?
Translate for you scratchin' the surface
Motherfucker, I need my payback

Slip and slide, I'm out of here, inside the whip
A thousand years, a thousand year
I want my payback
It's all for you, baby, yeah
And slip and slide, I'm out of here, inside the whip
A thousand years, a thousand year
I want my payback
It's all for you, babe

You were never a human bein'
You were never a human bein'
You were never a human bein'
I should just pack up my bags and get loaded
She sick and tired of distance, I'm a ghost
This ain't the time of my life, but I'm still on drugs
Just that weekend buzz
Have I been cheatin' myself? I'm implodin'
She's sick and tired of, "Listen, I'm broke"
This ain't the time of my life, but I'm still on drugs
Just that weekend buzz
You were never a human bein'
You were never a human bein'
You were never a human bein'
You were never a human bein'
(You were never a human bein')
I should put all of my trust in religion
I've hit the pavement and busted my nose
This ain't as hard as it gets, but I'm still on drugs
Just that weekend buzz
You were never a human bein'
You were never a human bein'
You were never a human bein'
This ain't as hard as it gets, but I'm still on drugs (You were never a human bein')
Just that weekend buzz (Weekend buzz)
(You were never) This ain't as hard as it gets, still on drugs
Just that weekend buzz
