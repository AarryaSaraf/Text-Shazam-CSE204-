Too busy livin' big
Too busy checkin' of my list of shit I never did
Drop top on all my whips
Ain't none these hoes my bitch
Ain't none these hoes my gig
Can't even hold my piss
Oh, that's your family, yo man?
When? How could you stand 'em?
He always try take advantage of a nigga
There the mink is
Bills paid for the shrink is
Lay back and calm your thinkin'
Ink pens, ink blot, I'm sinkin'
Sober so far and shrinkin'
Smokin' out my new Lincoln
Baby

Yeah, yeah, dollar signs in the mornin'
Where the fonk at?
Follow me, yeah
With all that money on your head
Bet it's trackers on your phone
Yeah, follow me, yeah, wayment
GPS another spot
Where the fonk at?
Uh, follow me, huh, yeah
With all that money on your head
Bet it's trackers on your phone
Yeah, follow me

What about our friendship, what about our kinship?
Pullin' up like uncles, chonkin' out my window
Worried 'bout my M's and my new utensils
Ho, just be gentle when we swervin' that, this ain't a rental
I got a blindfold when I'm aimin' that with no specifics
Now life is? For those who spite me with them false advices
Bootleggin' my CD, talkin' 'bout you bunkin', talkin' like you ballin'
Talkin' 'bout you got it, pattin' on my pocket
Bitch, know I know you
From frozens and black soap operas
My mob is slim as my goddess
You can't reach the top and everybody
I got things in order, who important
You ain't Uncle Bobby, or my cousin Risha
Please don't lean on me, bitch, I'm vibin'
Please don't pretend, can't depend on me
But bitch I got it, I'm on fire
You so Shang Tsung like, you switch like on lights
For all the chrome right, I'm gone and won't write
My perch and dome right, I'm in my zone right
Oh, he good, drop-top my Lincoln
Fuck I was thinkin'? (Oh, we should) Ayy, ayy

Yeah, yeah, dollar signs in the mornin'
Where the fonk at?
Follow me, yeah
With all that money on your head
Bet it's trackers on your phone
Yeah, follow me, yeah, wayment
GPS another spot
Where the fonk at?
Uh, follow me, huh, yeah
With all that money on your head
Bet it's trackers on your phone
Yeah, follow me

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Me
