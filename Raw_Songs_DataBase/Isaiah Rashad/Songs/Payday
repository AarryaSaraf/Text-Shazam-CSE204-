Aye, herringbone chain swang a bit
Telephone rang, hang the bitch
I just answer for the dough dough dough dough dough dough
I can't even really explain the shit
It ain't really been the same since I got some change

Hey Payday, please get rid of my headache

Moving through the levels hit the pedal when I go go go go go
