Peep me in the scope, if I'm gone, don't trip, baby
Bringin' back the strong, up to bat, all hits, baby
(That's cool, bitch, you're mine, yeah)
Yeah, yeah

Who want a shot, wanna die? (Yeah, yeah)
Lemme know, I got two on the hip and knot, no diggity
Zay, you smooth like a R&B song
How you keep them hoes off you? Man, they killin' me
Numero uno, might kick shit like judo, judo
Givin' out hoes, not kudos, kudos
Pocket fat like Juno, you know (Yeah)
Yeah, I tell her, "Bitch, eat it like Doja Cat"
You see the wrist whippin' like Bouldercrest (Yeah)
I got a crib bigger than Budapest (Yeah)
And the shots ain't bringin' my soldier back (Yeah)
From the noose to the drop, and the 'Wop, no diggity
New to the top and I rock new Tiffany's
Zay, you smooth like an R&B song
How you keep them hoes off you? Man, they killin' me (Yeah)

Okay, you caught me by surprise in my brand new whip, baby
Peep me in the scope, if I'm gone, don't trip, baby
Bringin' back the strong, up to bat, all hits, baby

It feel good since a nigga been back
But a nigga done changed, changed, changed, changed, changed
Weed couldn't settle my fire
Couldn't cover my pain, pain, pain, pain, pain (Ah, yeah)
Lane, lane, lane, lane, lane
Swang, swang, swang, swang, swang
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ah ye-ah, ye-ah, yeah)
I see God when I be ridin' out
Boy, you always ridin' 'round with a target on
If a nigga follow me to the car garage, I'ma spark it up
That's a Mack with a MAC in a Tonka trunk
Like my uncle son, got some thump in here
Like a trumpet, huh, when it's crunk in here
When it's dump in here? I'ma spark it up (O-O-Okay)

So, say what's on your mind, what's got you fired up?
(Okay, you caught me by surprise in my brand new whip, baby)
Tell me what you want, I'm in the water
(Peep me in the scope, if I'm gone, don't trip, baby)
And I'm drowning, babe, can you hold me down?
(Bringin' back the strong, up to bat, all hits, baby)
