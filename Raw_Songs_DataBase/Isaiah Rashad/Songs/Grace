One more time
Got some hoes
Got some hoes that read between the lines
I-, yeah
Got some hoes that read between the lines
I like smoking weed, I like that
I dream like three year old
Got my-, I like-
Yeah, yeah

I got some hoes that read between the lines
I like smoking weed, I like that, I dream like three year old
With my diamond teeth, I don't need no bitch to hold me down
I got more to see, got my sapphire 'focals on me now
No more monsters swarmin' round

DMT, I like to pound
It's my momma turn
Let me strike some rule, and you a fool
Are you down to burn?
Are you-are you down to hold it too?
Are you down to learn?
All my niggas know was Chattanoo'
Hand me down the shirt
I come from-I come from where you goin'
Where them bitches at? Where them bitches at?
Is that your Henn'? Let me finish that
Hoe, you know I'm good as granny food
Bring my nigga back
Rakim, don't you down that 100 proof
We just chillin', Jack, got 'em poppin' on a new terrain
On them bitches face
I could fuck her, flip her, to a Benz
With my better rims
They don't make no fuckin' picket line
For your cousin, then
You might catch me prayin' for some J
For some better rims

I got some hoes that read between the lines
I like smoking weed, I like that, I dream like three year old
With my diamond teeth, I don't need no bitch to hold me down
I got more to see, got my sapphire 'focals on me now
No more monsters swarmin' round
No more monsters swarmin' round

And just a reminder, regardless, you know you're special, yeah
So fuck the Matrix, the pineal, and phony vessels, yeah
We are the 'niners, we brought you a bowl for breakfast, yeah
I'm glad your offer is often, like, sacrificial, yeah
And oh my God, it's a God, I should never 'fessed it, yeah
Like can you call me, I'm fallin', I need a blessin', yeah
I never heard ya, I'm worried, I think you're human, yeah
I see you bleedin', you need me, I never knew ya, but
But bust it wide, when you visit me
Hoe, at least you know that it's Rashad
Over everything, now I got the world, but I was fine
With some Dairy Queen, I might fuck her, flip her, it's a line
'Till they bury me, guess what happened on that new terrain
In the better place, I can't choose between this medicine
And some better friends, thought we found the truth but then we lost
All the evidence, hold my Gucci, baby, don't get lost
In the Edison
Baby, Gucci, baby, hol' up

I like to smoke
Medicine, man
Lost, everything
Lost, Edison
I like to smoke
