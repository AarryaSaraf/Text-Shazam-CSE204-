The evils can't deceive us (You can't deceive us)
Not even in the mirror, the demons ain't outside
Together we perform (Forever, motherfucka)

Free rides to be we hit the floor then on the hunch (Free ride)
We only had a quarter for the lunch (Free ride)

I think I'm losin' friends but ain't nobody dead
Niggas be quick to call you brother (Quick to call you brother)
I'm with the one I split the mattress
Dumb hot whenever in a function
Please, nobody touches, but my kinfolk
The one that I had it poppin' too much
You probably caught me on the bottle too much
Well, I be livin' like my kinfolk
Smokin' out the window, Rashad fell off the wagon
Are we really surprised? It's been forever since

We did it, we did it for forever
You fuckin' with the greatest
You fuckin' with the greatest (The greatest)
The greatest
You fuckin', you fuckin', you fuckin' with the greatest (The greatest)

Feet don't fail me now

Wish I could be better right now
