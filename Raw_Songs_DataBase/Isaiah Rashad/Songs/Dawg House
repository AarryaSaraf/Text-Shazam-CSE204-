Loose better not shoot no shame
My 16's was pure cocaine
Base outside I'm hit ok
Ok, ok
What u gotta do
Get all this loot
Talk my shit, talk my truth
Hop outside
Park my coup
Ain't got no coup
But park mine

Bitch sit on this dick don't change
Funds out givin out tests these days
Guns out why would you kid these days
With these kids these days, lil Ray
Blunts up fillin my lungs
What's that in yo trunk
Its hitting like loose these days
Us these days
What she say
Fuck lazay
Ok

Who let the dogs out (Dog)
Turn the rap game to the fallout
Cheat on my bitch in the dog house
My rollie presidential from the white house
White House, black out
I'm lit everyday come find out
Imma big wave don't wipe out
You don't sell what bitch sign out
Ok

Bubblegum bubblegum in a dish
How many bitches do you get
Her she can't get no kiss
Imma top dawg hoe
I'm with a slim Mike Vick
Walk out the crib outfit on all shit
Would pull the switch if I ain't in by 6
Even DJ's ain't spinnin' like this
Got it out the mud bitch imma crawfish

Loose better not shoot no shame
My 16's was pure cocaine
Base outside I'm hit ok
Ok, ok
What you gotta do
Get all this loot
Talk my shit talk my truth
Hop outside
Park my coup
Ain't got no coup
But park mine
