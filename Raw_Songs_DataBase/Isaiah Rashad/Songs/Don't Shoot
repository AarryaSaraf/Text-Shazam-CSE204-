Smokin' a killer, dodgin' a killin', makin' a killin'
All right, check me out, ayy

Southside say you ain't got nothin' to live for
So you ain't got nothing to lose, but don't shoot (Don't shoot)
Yeah
Southside say you ain't got nothin' to live for
So you ain't got nothin' to lose, but don't- (Don't shoot)

Outside, my dude
He say he got a new drop on dubs
Vacay, no time
So how you gonna vacay? Get high
I'm smokin' the killer
Makin' a killing, dodgin' a killing
Come around talkin' about warrants
But they really just robbin' a nigga
Southside still busts speakers and tweeters and bitches and floosies and Cartier and kibble
How I'm finna let a bitch fuck up my rhythm
Nigga, I'm tryna make it back, my nigga
Dropped out thinkin' bout stacks
Still thinkin' about cash
Tell them crackers come catch me, nigga
Tell 'em get the noose off my neck
My nigga, I ain't finna let this shit fuck with my head
Ain't shit left to give a fuck about, they don't give a fuck about shit

Southside say you ain't got nothin' to live for
So you ain't got nothing to lose, but don't shoot (Don't shoot)
Yeah
Southside say you ain't got nothin' to live for
So you ain't got nothin' to lose, but don't- (Don't shoot)

Don't die, my dude
They say it's finna go down, on bloods
Can't blame your God
Sometimes you gotta maintain your side
My days too long
Sometimes I wanna lay down and love
Vacay, no time
So how you finna vacay? Get high
They been shippin' my nigga off a twenty-eight summer
Nigga only been free for like three, four months
Niggas losing they life like three, four hundred, yeah
You see the habit goes both ways
They was digging in my pockets, I was digging in my pockets
You was lookin' to a light
And I was lookin' for a lighter
I was fuckin' with the fire in the worst way

Southside say you ain't got nothin' to live for
So you ain't got nothing to lose, but don't shoot (Don't shoot)
Yeah
Southside say you ain't got nothin' to live for
So you ain't got nothin' to lose, but don't- (Don't shoot)

(Don't shoot)
(Don't shoot)
