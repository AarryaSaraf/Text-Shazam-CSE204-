Avicii
Mr. Worldwide

I've been around the world
And I can't stop hearing this song
I've been around the world
And I can't stop hearing this song
And I love it


Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start

They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me


So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost



Life's not waiting for a storm
It's about dancing in the rain
And if it rains lemons
Learn how to make lemonade
Morale of a story
No problems, just solutions
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
We have takeoff, Houston
I'm not them boys that they used to
I got 4 million views collected on YouTube
I grew up around Jesus, coke and thick girls
And that inspired me to be a G note speaker
2 thinks guaranteed, definitely actions
They say the devil's in the details and I won't ask this
We got the maker
We got a dream, it's simple
Live it, wake up


So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost



Didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)
