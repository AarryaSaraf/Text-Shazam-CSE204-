Dirt on your shoulders
I swear I remember when it changed
Don't you remember
I swear I can see it

You're there with your one eyes smile again
You'll be alright now
If you just let it go
Let it go

I feel the weight around you breaking your bones
Let me make it better (Whoa)
Settle down and let me carry you home
Let me ease the pressure (Oh)

Pull all the blinds down
Just close both your eyes now
Yeah I'll stay
Turn all the lights out and stay awake
And fight off the demons
'Cause you got a heart that'll never take
Yeah, it's alright now
You gotta let it go
Let it go
