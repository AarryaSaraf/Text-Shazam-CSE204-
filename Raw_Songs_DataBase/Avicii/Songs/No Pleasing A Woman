I'm tired of being down on my knees,
With the weight of the world coming down on me,
She says there's always someone better waiting for her,
That I was so lucky to get her,

I'm tired of being down on my knees,
With the weight of the world coming down on me,
She says there's always someone better waiting for her,
I was so lucky that I get her,

Y'know, I, I wanna cry,
I wonder why all the tears are dry,
I just don't dare to show I care,
I got nothin' left to spare,

I wonder why I try,
I wonder why when nothin' pleases a woman,
I wonder why I try,
I wonder why when nothin' pleases a woman,
When nothin' pleases a woman,
There's just no pleasin' a woman,
