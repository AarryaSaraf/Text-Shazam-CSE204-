Your whole life's been building up to this moment
Your whole life's been building up to this day
Every dream that moved you
Every scarm improved you
Every voice around you 
Tells you to believe

You can take it to the top
And you're never gonna stop
In it to win it
O oh o o o oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Take it to the top

The stage is yours to show the world what you're made of
This is where you rise and reach for the sky
Nothing gonna stop you
Here because you saw through
Anything to keep you
From what you believe

You can take it to the top
And you're never gonna stop
In it to win it
O oh o o o oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Take it to the top
