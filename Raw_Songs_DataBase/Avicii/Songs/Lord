All my life I just wanted to be free
All my life been blind I've been taught by greed
Oh lord, what's wrong what's wrong with me?
Oh lord, that dollar is all I see

That dollar is all I see

All my life I just wanted to be free
All my life been blind I've been taught by greed
Oh lord, what's wrong what's wrong with me?
Oh lord, that dollar is all I see

All my life I just wanted to be free
All my life been blind I've been taught by greed
Oh lord, what's wrong what's wrong with me?
Oh lord, that dollar is all I see

I left my home as a gift to my past
Next to the things I know will never last
I looked for fire but found nothing but ash
Was at my lowest when it hit like a flash
