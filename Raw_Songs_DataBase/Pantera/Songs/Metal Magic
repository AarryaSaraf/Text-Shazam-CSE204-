When they say don't look back
Do what they say
You gotta look ahead
To a better day
In a world of metal magic
You need a break
Go forth
Take a chance
Make no mistake

Metal magic
Metal magic
Metal magic
Metal magic

They say you can't go back
Oh so true
When you're a rocker baby
You gotta pay your dues

In a world of metal magic
Magic never ends
Sometimes you lose
And sometimes you win

Metal magic
Metal magic
Metal magic
Metal magic

Lost in the metal magic
It never ends
Sometimes you lose
Sometimes you win

Metal magic
Metal magic
Metal magic
Yeah
