People running in the street
Looking for some meat to eat
It's in your dirty magazines
All across your TV screens

Midnight riders
In the street
Feel the fire
Catch the heat

You better go down below!
You better go down below!

See the ladies of the night
Built for speed to my delight
I steal them in my limousine
Hear them shout hear them scream

Midnight riders
In the street
Feel the fire
Catch the heat

It's a dirty job
But somebody's gotta do it

You better go down below!
You better go down below!

(And she's down for the count!)
