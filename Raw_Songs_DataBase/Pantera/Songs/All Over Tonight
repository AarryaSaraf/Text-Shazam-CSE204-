It's late, when I see your face, all crapped up in my room
Well all right, well it's taken all night, been searchin' for you
Aw come on, take it down, give me some action, don't wanna see your face
Oh yeah, it's o.k., been drinkin' my whiskey, there's got to be another way
It's all over tonight
It's all over, all over tonight
Action!

Head's swimmin' round and round, it's gettin' under my skin
I'm sayin'. I wanna take you down, I'm gonna do you in
Come on, go down, give me some action, don't wanna see your face
Oh yeah, it's o.k., been drinkin' my whiskey, got to be another way
It's all over tonight
It's all over, all over tonight
