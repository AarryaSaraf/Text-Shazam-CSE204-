His stillborn army is impeccable
Satan's wrath is the only choice

Modern day plague
Stronger than any and every virus, disease or sickness
Full eclipse
Of ideology
Anti-christian
And eternally alive (undead)
Buried underneath
Two thousand years (of histories)
Yet able to rise
Instinctively arise

Avoid the light
The sun's in sight
The undead should be sleeping
Avoid the light
And cross upright
My fledgling's dropping, weeping
Avoid the light
Avert your sight
Go underground discretely
Avoid the light
Avoid the light
Avoid the light
Avoid the light

True and purely horror
Man's ultimate enemy and predator wrapped into one

Spread like wings
Of damnated
Then folding into
Shape immortal man (not slaved)
Plasmic umber
Will override (true emotions)
The peer inversion
To guard my countless graves

Avoid the light
The sun's in sight
The undead should be sleeping
Avoid the light
And cross upright
My fledgling's dropping, weeping
Avoid the light
Avert your sight
Go underground discretely
Alone, unseen, reborn, received

It's a battle of wills (it's a battle of wills)
Ingloriously killed (we shall devour)

Avoid the light
The sun's in sight
The undead should be sleeping
Avoid the light
And cross upright
My fledgling's dropping, weeping
Avoid the light
Avert your sight
Go underground discretely
Avoid the light
Avoid the light
Avoid the light
Avoid the light


His stillborn army is impeccable
Satan's wrath is the only choice
