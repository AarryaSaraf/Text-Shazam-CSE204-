Deathlike silence
Red cloud shakes
A race that walls immortality
The undying battle of extinction
Who would believe in sanctuary

Huh, sanctuary

Weapons of lead are post-historic
Life is yielded unto sour ground
A desert shell is designated
A warning to you both man and beast

Destroying, destroying
Foundation, foundation
I'm going, I'm going
Forever, forever

Immortally insane
Immortally insane
Immortally insane
Immortally insane

Eden hardly a tranquil place
The prophecy lears its hateful face
The warheads like lightning strike again and again
Seperating the land from the wolf and man

Huh, no sanctuary

Survivors will rise from strength and brain
The skulls of rivals lay in rows on the sand
The seeds of breeding swallow the waste
Creating more for the next war

Destroying, destroying
Foundation, foundation
I'm going, I'm goin
Forever, forever

Immortally insane
Immortally insane
Immortally insane
Immortally insane

Immortally insane
Immortally insane
Immortally insane
Immortally insane

Immortally insane
Immortally insane
Insane
