Album: ReinventingTheSteel

// Hellbound //

Eliminate, the life decline...
I've paid the masters with blood and hunger
...And it's not for sale by any stretch.
It's like religion without a Bible
And the Dragon lives inside my mouth
And it speaks in tongues, the word...

Hellbound - in Ft. Worth, Texas
Hellbound - Ft. Worth

Snakes, in Southern flames
To bring the thunder; the great decider
Would you believe in this or the ash?
I do believe it and it's taking over...
Accept

Born to a world so young and proud
But over your head hangs a black cloud
Grow your hair and crawl inside yourself
Because there you cannot hide
Facing fears that you'll overcome and one
Of these years you know you've won

// Goddamn Electric //

There is a part of me that's always sixteen
I've found the secret of eternal youth
Some get high on life or money, but there's an
Escape, drop out of the race.
- To walk through the world by ones self, you can't be
Protected... your trust is in whiskey and weed and
Black Sabbath - It's Goddamn Electric

Don't waste your time, embrace it
And then you'll know yourself
The change in you is Goddamn Electric

The weight of the world has lifted and parted
My eyes roll blind to sights that distracted
Through tunnel-vision and dope-hair blinders
I'll cut a path and evoke my will
- To walk through the world by ones self, you can't
Be protected... your trust is in whiskey and weed
And Slayer, it's Goddamn Electric

Don't fake your life - inhale it
And then you'll know yourself
The change in you is Goddamn Electric
Don't waste your time, embrace it
Annd then you'll know yourself
The change that is Goddamn Electric will focus>
The Mind's Eye...

One hand on the bottle, the other a shaking
Fist, rejuvinated, isolated, no pressure
From the outside, my sight's Goddamn Electric
And these eyes have seen a world
Goddamn Electric system...

// Yesterday Don't Mean Shit //

There's nothing special about it
It's either there when you're born or not
Gifted with talent are no big deal
Welcome to the death of a century...

Cause yesterday don't mean shit
What's over is over and nothing between
Yesterday don't mean shit
Because tomorrow's the day you have to face
There's no rewinding time
Yesterday don't mean shit
Yesterday don't mean shit

Reliving old reviews is a useless tool of confusion
Don't hold your breath for the turn-around
Come into the world of endless odds...

They'll tell you about guilt
And in time you'll face the darkness...
But darkness is a friend to you
Embrace and fly through the madness
Flying past God and wars and conflict
Oppressor in you [x2]
Plowing through minds and paranoia
Oppressor in you
The oppressor's in you

Yesterday don't mean jack shit...

To protect you and I'll keep to myself
It can only be that way - yeah!

// You've Got To Belong To It //

Build an inner door, drop and then explore
You smoke your head on straight, then drink
Your woes away -
Some might not understand possession
Controls your head

You recognize it, while some ignore it
Avoid the masses, you've got to belong to it

Your music is your friend? But the roof
Above my head. So seriously I take the will
That never breaks
Some might not understand, possession
Beyond your hands...

It's power and sin, and then you've got all the other habits
Whiskey and smoke
It's all that we could need, to plant the perfect
Seed, disembody me - yeah...

// Revolution Is My Name //

68' into the world born
And the Seventies, a breath after the war
Life was confusing because of my age
Should my eyes open for tomorrow's gains?
I can't help the way I am
There's no trust and there's no end
What is my name?

It will never change
So here it stays
Forever is my name

From now on, can't look the other way
Keep in mind and listen to what I say
Take under wing all the ones who are lost
Build up around them an infinite wall
Don't you know just who I am?
Take the hand of wisdom's friend
What is my name?

It's time to change
It can't stay the same
Revolution is my name
It will never change
So here it stays
Forever is my name

What is my name?
Forever...

What is my name?
Revolution...

// Death Rattle //

Numbing rumble, countless medicine,
Depleted from years of abuse
Death rattle shaking
And there's no faking, undertaking

Pressure point, rigor mortis
Induce, grasp of poison hands
Death rattle shaking
From years of compulsive mistaking

Death rattle shakes

Disease of eyes, the addict blindfold, reduced to
The realms of death
Death rattle shaking
Accumulating life it's taking

Death rattle shakes

I've seen the end, and there is no light.
Like deadly snakes, death rattle shakes

// We'll Grind That Axe For A Long Time //

Wears 10 crowns, dragons heads
Southern are the sons, Lords unmatched
- Their eyes don't look right, should they be trusted now?
Trashed-mouth Gods, avoided kings
With the spirit of revolt, the ghost of youth

Every fucking year it stays the same
Everybody changes to suit the day
Out of pride I'll isolate my fears
Never turned our backs on why we're here
We'll grind that axe for a long time

Follow close, train of fools
Just like them, just like you
- Their eyes don't seem right.
"Easily impressed" plague, dressed up fake
No respect

Every fucking year remains the same
Everybody sucks-up to suit the day
Out of hate I'll isolate myself
Through the worst we still marched into hell
We'll grind that axe for a long time
The smell in the air is chicken shit.

We'll grind that axe for a long time

Every fucking song remains the same
To everyone who sucks-up for the fame
Out of strength you know we speak the truth
Every trend that dies is living proof
We'll grind that axe for a long time

// Uplift //

On one whole bottle "uplifting!"
There is no telling what I'll do
Run head first into traffic
A mindset of annihilation

No sense makes sense
You can't get bought without thought
Ahh... no sense makes sense
You can't get bought without thought inside
Your head now

Uplift - uplifting
Uplifting now

On hallucinogenic "uplift"
I can step out of my body
Religion is in myself
I'll split my head in two and see you twice

No sense makes sense
You can't get bought without thought
Ahh... no sense makes sense
You can't get bought without thought inside
your head now

Uplift... uplifting
Uplifting now...
Uplifting you now...

Give me alcohol extremeties
Instead of proofless christianity
Drunked up in a coma place
Critics disgusted, but a smile on my fucking face
I do anything that I want
And I get everything that I ask
And if this message bothers you, you know
Just kiss my fucking ass hole

// It Makes Them Disappear //

The time had finally come to kill the vein.
And I'm dropping down the dirt on your grave
It might hurt so bad, but I can't feel sad
Rid of a fool like you
The wrath has just begun
The time has finally come
And it hurts so bad, and it drives me mad
Life with a blinded view (of you)

It makes them disappear
It fills their life with fear
When their future isn't clear
It makes them disappear

- Gone -

So the coward has up and run to be saved
But with each step taken down, you sink in your grave
It might hurt so bad, but I can't feel sad
Rid of a fool like you

Get the fuck on down the road

// I'll Cast A Shadow //

The end will crush the light
And sends a message, It won't please
The naked eye
Without and end there is no light
To foretell, to blind you
The law of the claw reigns on and after still

When I die, I cast a shadow
And I'll rise, I cast a shadow

I'm leaving more eyes open
I close up both of mine
For the ones that chase my life
They're looking over shoulders
Let paranoia in
Spontaneously rule them

When I die, I cast a shadow
And I'll fly, I cast a shadow

Everybody get fucking up!
I cast a shadow...
I... I cast a shadow
I cast a shadow...
I... I cast a shadow

When I die, I cast a shadow
And I'll rise, I cast a shadow
