// Primal Concrete Sledge //

There's a double standard for the way we live
If there's nothing to have, well then there's nothing to give
I'll break a sweat and I don't regret
What you'd kill to see brings out the god in me.

Come and be with me
Live my twisted dream
Pro devoted pledge
Time for primal concrete sledge

The man of a thousand retirements
Will always be the one to tell you when to quit
I won't take stock in a withered man
I'm reaching into you, I'll make you understand

Come and be with me
Live my twisted dream
Pro devoted pledge
Time for primal concrete sledge

[Guitar Solo]

Come and be with me
Live my twisted dream
Pro devoted pledge
Time for primal concrete

Come and be with me
Live my twisted dream
Pro devoted pledge
Time for primal concrete sledge

// Psycho Holiday //

Empty and sweating
Head lying in your hands
Shaking in the corner
Done too much alcohol
Gotta get away from it all
'Cause it feels my blood is freezing
My self insanity has taken its toll
Frustration has taken its control

Now I'm far from home
Spending time alone
It's time to set my demons free
Been put to the test
My mind laid to rest
I'm on a psycho holiday

Shot down on sight
You are the target of attention
One woman here another there
You can't please all the people all the time
Can't tell the strangers
From the friends you know
Frustration has taken it's control

Now you're far from home
Spending time alone
It's time to set your demons free
Been put through the test
Your mind laid to rest
You're on a psycho holiday

I'm strapped in for life
Is this where I lived
Or where I died
You want my money
You take my space
My mind is telling me
To leave this place
My self insanity has taken its toll
Frustration has taken its control

Now you're far from home
Spending time alone
It's time to set your demons free
Been put through the test
Your mind laid to rest
You're on a psycho holiday

// Heresy //

Here we are
In a world of corruption
Human nature is
Of violent Breed
Who cares if there's no tomorrow
When I die for my future's
Laid out for me
Can't you see?
Rise above the lies
Morals on a backwards globe
A sin to you
For me it's hope.

It's my life and provision
Black or white
Some pay to pray
You question why they
Act this way
It's their fucking decision

No more judgement day
Only tranquility
Peace signs, protest lines
Mean nothing to me

Honesty born in me
Heresy

I know what's right or wrong
And my belief is stronger
Than your advice
People, they go to war
Because religion gives them
Reason to fight
Sacrifice, die for pride
A group that caters
No one's fees
Or synthetic deities
Is where I belong
My stand is the human race
Without a label or a face
So they can lick my sack

No more judgement day
Only tranquility
Peace signs, protest lines
Mean nothing to me

Honesty born in me
Heresy

// Domination //

First take like a motherfucker!

Agony is the price
That you'll pay in the end
Domination consumes you
Then calls you a friend
It's a twisted fall

Binds are like steel
And manipulates the will
To be
And it's hard to see
How soon we forget
When there's nothing else left
To destroy
It's a useless ploy

Your eyes will see the dawn of the day
And the writing on the wall
Those words that stare into your soul
And to yourself you will befall

It's domination
Pushed into living hell
Domination

A now blacked heart
Is reaching out in divinity
Body suspended by chains over razors
And nails
It's a penalty

Each razor a vice
And each nail marks demise
Of your life
Grim construction grows
And life played a trick
Sealed you in brick by brick
'Til your end
Forcing you to bend

Your eyes will see the dawn of the day
And the writing on the wall
Those words that stare into your soul
And to yourself you will befall

It's domination
Pushed into living hell
Domination

// Shattered //

It's storming broken glass, corpses left in piles
Ungracious bludgeonmnet that breaks the earth for miles
Nothing can stop it, the day has come, from below it's catastrophic

Freezing, there's no healing families are dying

This world is shattered... all shattered

Life crushing turbulence, this wrath can't be denied
Wishing you could help your friends, standing where they died
Echoes haunting, a hollow planet, lacerations, dissected nation

Freezing, there's no healing everyone is dying

This world is shattered... all shattered

// Clash With Reality //

Sometimes I know
I feel untouchable
Drowning in life
Caught up in the accessible
Back down the ground
I hear the sound
there's no escape
The concrete cloud
Spilling on me
Drenching me with
Laymen's sins
I hear the sirens
From the back of me
I'm crashing face first
Into the glass eye

Clash with reality
It rears it's ugly head
Clash with reality
The indescribable
Let the dogs lie
Where we sleep
Irrelevant theme

A situation and there's
Nothing but right
In kicks the door
Nobody moves
'Cause in walks the problem
Dictates your fate
Evicts, convicts
Who'll sign the writ of life?
This now becomes
Their morbid game
Who's piss poor excuse
Is this for a world?
It swells my hatred
Day by day

Clash with reality
It rears it's ugly head
Clash with reality
The indescribable
Let the dogs lie
Where we sleep
Irrelevant theme

// Medicine Man //

Many distant miles away
Past the shores of ever dark
There stays a magic man
Who bears an evil mark
He helps all concerned
Those who come again return
Injecting lies while fires burn
The devil's heart
With angel's words
Have you wondered
What heaven's like?
He can show you in one night
Overwhelming with euphoric lift
To lure you to steal your gift

Intoxication
Seeping down to the bone
And there's no question
Where you have to go

Understand just take his hand
He's the medicine man

Once proud and fearless men
With desire in their eyes
Lost strong and fruitful lives
To self-indulgent ties
Their souls were dipped in venom
And put into a box
Then placed upon a crowded shelf
Where countless souls now rot
Have you ever wondered what hell's like?
He can take you there
Just one taste and you'll be back
And by the high you'll swear

Intoxication
Seeping down to the bone
And there's no question
Where you have to go

Understand just take his hand
He's the medicine man

// Message In Blood //

There's a place that I keep deep inside me
It can trigger my mind
All along I knew it has been with me
Since I was just a child

I just summon power within my soul
It has given me life, beyond life I take
Blame for my murderous problem my signature
Always reminds

It's a message in blood
It's your cryptic warning
Within the message in blood
Marks the years of pain,
And your godforsaken ending to life

I'm provoked into sick confrontations, brutal
Time after time, bed of nails, suffocation,
life's ending, slay in different designs
One mans misery is another mans mystery
No one cares to understand my
Demented means
Sticks and stones can break all your
brittle bones, epitaph written at your feet

It's a message in blood
It's your cryptic warning
Within the message in blood
Marks the years of pain,
And your godforsaken ending to life

// The Sleep //

Understanding what has
Happened before us
We are confined to a
Darkened hidden tomb
The conquering of our world
As we knew it
Rise above this pit
Of sorrow and pain
Among the few
We are the avant leaders
We've got to live
Through this trouble and decay

This question haunts my mind
Will we survive this night?
We're harboring the meek
Will we survive the sleep?

Unsure and scared
We are planning our reprise
Revolves around this world
We don't know anymore
The odds against us
Yet we're stronger and prevailing
Learn from mistakes
Counting souls for sale

This question haunts my mind
Will we survive this night?
We're harboring the meek
Will we survive the sleep?

// The Art Of Shredding //

Unity is a rare thing
Blind eyes of society bring
The category of minority
Now what are we supposed to be?
Born free to be
Powerless to change the world
With our lives in the hands of madmen

Now in times when society needs us
This is where the sin begins
We're aware they're going to free us
Rage from our hearts within
Born of this world
Which is a living hell
But we'll be closer to heaven

So now, this is the art
To shred... it's only emotion
