So...let's do Orange Colored Sky
Yeah?
I used to sing this at the Oak Room with my buddies
Woo! It's getting windy

I was walking along, minding my business
When out of the orange colored sky
Flash, bam, alakazam
Wonderful you came by
I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine
When out of that orange colored view
Wham, bam, alakazam
I got a look at you

Oh, one look and I yelled, "Timber!"
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit
This is it, this is it

I was walking along, minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Wham, bam, alakazam
Out of the orange colored sky

Oh-oh-oh-oh, one look and I yelled, "Timber!"
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out
I went into a spin and I started to shout
I've been hit
This is it, this is it

I was walking along, minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye
Wham, bam, alakazam
Out of the orange colored, purple striped, pretty green polka-dot sky
Wham, bam, alakazam
And gone, bye
Goodbye
