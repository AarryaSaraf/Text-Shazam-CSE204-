Don't be girl, don't be burnt
Don't be my glamour zombie
We dance and we show
And baby girl I'll be the prison
Don't be girl, don't be burnt
Don't be my glamour zombie
I love you
I love us
I love this planet zombie

Love don't promise
Boy, d'you still miss me?
Love don't promise
Boy, d'you still miss me?
Love don't promise
Boy, d'you still miss me?
Love don't mind
I just can't, stand it now

Don't be girl, don't be burnt
Don't be my glamour zombie
We dance and we show
And baby girl I'll be the prison
Don't be girl, don't be burnt
Don't be my glamour zombie
I love you
I love us
I love this planet zombie

Don't be girl, don't be burnt
Don't be my glamour zombie
We dance and we show
And baby girl I'll be the prison
Don't be girl, don't be burnt
Don't be my glamour zombie
I love you
I love us
I love this planet zombie
