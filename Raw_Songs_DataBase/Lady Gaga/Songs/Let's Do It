When the little bluebird who has never said a word
Starts to sing, "Spring, spring"
When the little bluebell in the bottom of the dell
Starts to ring, ding ding

When the little blue clerk, in the middle of his work
Starts a tune to the Moon up above
It is nature, that's all, simply telling us to fall
In love

And that's why birds do it
Bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it
Let's fall in love

In Spain, the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it
Let's fall in love

The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Finns
Folks in Siam do it
Think of Siamese twins

Some Argentines, without means, do it
People say, "In Boston, even beans do it"
Let's do it
Let's fall in love, oh

Take it, Brian
Yeah

Electric eels, I might add, do it
Though it shocks 'em, I know
Why ask if shad do it?
Waiter, bring me Shad Roe

In shallow shoals, English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it
Let's fall in love

Let's do it
Let's fall in love
