It don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
(Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah)

No, it don't mean a thing, all you gotta do is swing
(Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah)

Makes no difference if it's sweet or it's hot
Give it all the rhythm that you've got
Oh, it don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
(Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, Tony, Gaga)

It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm everything you've got

Oh, it don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
(Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah)

(Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah)

(Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah
Doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah, doo-wah)
