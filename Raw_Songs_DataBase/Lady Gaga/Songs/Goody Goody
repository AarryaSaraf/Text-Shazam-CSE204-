So you met someone who set you back on your heels
(He's a sucker)
Goody goody!
So you met someone and now you know how it feels
(Let me just say that)
Goody goody!

So you gave him your heart too
Just as I gave mine to you
(Stop talking about this stuff)
And he broke it in little pieces
Now how do you do?
(It's not funny Tony)

So you lie awake singing the blues all night
Goody goody!
So you think that love's a barrel of dynamite
(I told you I'm not goody, I'm a baddie)

Hurray and hallelujah!
You had it coming to ya
(Think you're funny, huh?)

Goody goody for him
Goody goody for me
(Goody goody for you)
And I hope you're satisfied you rascal you
(That's real cheeky, Tony)

So you met someone who set you back on your heels
(So what?)
Goody goody!
So you met someone and now you know how it feels
(I was confused, you know?)
Goody goody!

So you gave him your heart too
Just as I gave mine to you
And he broke it in little pieces
(I know)
Now how do you do?

So you lie awake just singing the blues all night
(Yeah, all night, a-ha)
Goody goody!
So you think that love's a barrel of dynamite
(Yeah. So what? Sometimes)

Hurray and hallelujah!
You had it coming to ya
(Stop laying that)

Goody goody for him
Goody goody goody for me!
(I'm not a goody, I'm a baddie)

Your love has been denied
You've been taken for a ride
(What? Are you happy now?)
And I hope you're satisfied you rascal you!
(Yeah, I'll be fine. Just stop singing that song)
