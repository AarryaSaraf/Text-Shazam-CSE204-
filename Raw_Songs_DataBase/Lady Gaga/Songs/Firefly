I call her Firefly
'Cause, oh, my
She radiates moon glow
Wants none of that noon glow
She starts to glitter
When the sun goes down

'Bout eight P.M., it's mayhem
She switches the brights up
Lights up and gives me a call
"Take me to the Fireflies ball"

But when I get her there
Set her there
Do I get to pet her there
Grab me some glow

No, she's a gad about, mad about
Luring every lad about
While leaving me moaning low

Oh, Firefly, why can't I
Latch onto you no how
Oh, how I love you but gee
While you set the night on
Firefly, shine a little light on me

He calls me Firefly
'Cause, oh, my
I radiate moon glow
Want none of that noon glow
Start to glitter
When the sun goes down

'Bout eight P.M., it's mayhem
I'm switching those brights up
Light up and give him a call
"Take me to the Fireflies ball"

When I get her there
I set her there
Do I get to pet her there
Grab me some glow

Well, she's a gad about, mad about
Luring every lad about
While leaving me moaning low

Oh, Firefly, why can't I
Latch on for you no how
Oh, how I love you but gee
While you set the night on
Firefly, shine a little light on
Shine a little light on
Shine a little light on me
(In the mornin')
