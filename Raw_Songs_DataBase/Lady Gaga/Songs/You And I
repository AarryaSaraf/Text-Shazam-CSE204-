It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time, but I'm back in town
This time I'm not leaving without you
You taste like whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I'm not leaving without you

He said, "Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love the first time and you said to me,"

(Something), something about this place
(Something), something about New York Nights
And my lipstick on your face
Something, something about my cool American guy
Yeah, there's something about, baby, you and I

America, America, I love you!
You and I

You, you, you and I
You, you and I
You, you and I
You, you and I, I
You and I
You, you, you and I
America, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I

We got a whole lot of money, but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in Heaven
There's only three men that I'ma serve my whole life
It's my daddy, and America, and Jesus Christ
(Happy Thanksgiving)

(Something), something about the chase
Six whole years
So put your drinks up, put your drinks up
For America, America, I love you

You, you and I
Oh yeah, well, I'd rather die
Without you and I, I
