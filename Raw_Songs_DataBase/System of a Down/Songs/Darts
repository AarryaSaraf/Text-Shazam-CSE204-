Arise as did the gods Ninti
Arise as did the gods Ninti
Arise as did the gods Ninti and Ishkur

Clock men, for they will fail
Fear not the gods that come from the sky
Long not for the one who've lost their way
Long not for the one who've lost their way

Arise as did the gods Ninti
Arise as did the gods Ninti
Arise as did the gods Ninti and Ishkur, Ishkur motherfucker!

Can you tell me?
I don't know
