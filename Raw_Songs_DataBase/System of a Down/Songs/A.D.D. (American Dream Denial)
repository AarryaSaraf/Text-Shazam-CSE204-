We fought your wars with all our hearts,
You sent us back in body parts,
You took our wills with the truth you stole,
We offer prayers for your long lost soul.

The remainder is an unjustifiable, egotistical power struggle at the expense of the American Dream, of the American dream, of the American

We don't give a damn about your world
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls,
We don't give a damn about your world,
Right now, right now.
We don't give a fuck about your world,
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls,
We don't give a fuck about your world,
Right now, right now.
Right now, right now.

There is no flag that is large enough
To hide the shame of a man in cuffs,
You switched the signs then you closed their blinds,
You changed the channel then you changed their minds.

The remainder is an unjustifiable, egotistical power struggle at the expense of the American Dream, of the American dream, of the American

We don't give a damn about your world
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls,
We don't give a damn about your world,
Right now, right now.
We don't give a fuck about your world,
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls,
We don't give a fuck about your world,
Right now, right now.
Right now, right now.
Right now, right now.
Right now, right now.

No flag large enough,
Shame on a man in cuffs,
You closed their blinds.

The remainder is an unjustifiable, egotistical power struggle at the expense of the American Dream, of the American dream, of the American

We don't give a damn about your world,
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls,
We don't give a damn about your world,
Right now, right now.
We don't give a fuck about your world,
With all your global profits and all your jeweled pearls,
We don't give a fuck about your world,
Right now, right now,
Right now, right now,
Right now, right now,
Right now-now-now-now
