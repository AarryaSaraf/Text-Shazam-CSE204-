Let me desecrate your child
Let me penetrate your world
Let me penetrate your mind
Let me desecrate you

Don't let me desecrate you, my child
Don't let me penetrate your world
And steal the warmness of your soul away
Don't let me desecrate you, my child
Don't let me penetrate your world
And steal the warmness of your soul away

I divide you with faith
Provide you your soul
Defy you to love
I divide you with your faith
I provide you with your soul
I defy you into love

Don't let me desecrate you, my child
Don't let me penetrate your world
And steal the warmness of your soul away
Don't let me desecrate you, my child
Don't let me penetrate your world
And steal the warmness of your soul away

I divide you with faith
Provide you your soul
Defy you to love
I divide you with your faith
I provide you with your soul
I defy you into love

Little boy stared into the eyes of the night
Button collects price of his time
Little girl bled, sheets of the night
Bullet connects to the price of its crime

I divide you with faith
Provide you your soul
Defy you to love
I divide you with your faith
I provide you with your soul
I defy you into love
I divide you with faith
Provide you your soul
Defy you to love
I divide you with your faith
I provide you with your soul
I defy you into love
