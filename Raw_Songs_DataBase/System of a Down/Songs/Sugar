The kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who can believe you?
Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray

Sugar!
Sugar!

I'm not there all the time, you know
Some people, some people, some people
Call it insane!
Yeah, they call it insane! (Sugar!)

I play Russian Roulette every day, a man's sport
With the bullet called life
Yeah mama, called life! (Sugar!)
You know that every time I try to go
Where I really want to be
It's already where I am
'Cause I'm already there!

The kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who can believe you?
Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray

Sugar!

I got a gun the other day from Sako
It's cute, small, fits right in my pocket
Yeah, right in my pocket! (Sugar!)
My girl, you know, she lashes out at me sometimes
And I just fucking kick her in the
Ooh baby, she's OK (Sugar!)
People are always chasing me down
Trying to push my face to the ground
Where all they really want to do
Is suck out my motherfucking brains!

Sugar!

The kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who can believe you?
Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray!

I sit... in my desolate room...
No lights!
No music!
Just anger!
I killed everyone
I'm gone away forever
But I'm feeling better!
How do I feel, what do I say
Fuck you, it all goes away
How do I feel, what do I say
Fuck you, it all goes away

How do I feel, what do I say
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel, what do I say
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel, what do I say
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel, what do I say
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel, what do I say
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel, what do I say

In the end it all goes away
In the end it all goes away
In the end it all goes away
In the end it all goes away
In the end it all goes away
