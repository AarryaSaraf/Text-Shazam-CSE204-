Oh baby come close to me,
Let me love you.
Oh baby come close to me,
Let me feel you.

Look at each other 
Look at each other

Go away, go away, go away, go away.

Well, now, mutually mentally molested children of a mother.
Mutually mentally molested children of sin.

Bow down
The ever so popular beating that took you under,
Bow down
The ever so popular beating that broke your skin.

Free thinkers are dangerous,
Blame, hate, for fate's sake.

Go away, go away, go away, go away.

Now you need the ones you love and love the ones that you need.
Need the ones you love and love the ones you bleed.

Lives rearranged and lives in my range can you see.
Lives rearranged and lives in my range can you see.

Free thinkers are dangerous,
Blame, hate, for fate's sake.

Die, die, die, die
Gonna let you mother fuckers die 
Gonna let you mother fuckers die 
Gonna let you mother fuckers die 


Look at each other 
Look at each other 
Look at each other
