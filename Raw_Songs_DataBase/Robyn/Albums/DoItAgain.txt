Album: DoItAgain

// Monument //

Make a space
For my body
Dig a hole
Push the sides apart
This is what
I'm controlling
It's a moat
The inside that I carve

This will my monument
This will be a beacon when I'm gone
Gone, gone
When I'm gone
Gone, gone
When I'm gone

So that when the moment comes
I can say I did it all with love
Love, love
All with love
Love, love
All with love

Make a cast
Of my body
Pull back out
So that I can see
Let go of
How you knew me
Let go of
What I used to be

I will let this monument
Represent a moment of my life
Life, life
Of my life
Life, life
Of my life

I will let this monument
Represent a moment of my life
Life, life
Of my life
Life, life
Of my life

Make a cast
Of my body
Pull back out
So that I can see
Let go of
How you knew me
Let go of
What I used to be

Say say say...

Say say say...

I want you

I (I) want (want) you (you)

I (I) want (want) you (you)
Woman, woman, woman
Bitches

I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you too
I want you
I want you too
I want you
I want you too
I want you
I want you too
I want you
I want you too

Wait, stop
Almost ready
Ready

Pleasure machine
Fuck mechanic

I want you
I want you too
I want you
I want you too
I want you
I want you too
I want you
I want you too

Quiet!

// Do It Again //

One more time
Let's do it again
Blow my mind
Do it again
And then it arrives, the moment before
The anticipation, you know it's like Mmm-mmm-mmm
Wait for it, wait for the build up
And then let's do it again

We do what we want, and as soon as it's done
We just do it again
Let's do it all, and when we come down
We just do it again
Don't care what they say, it hurts so good
I don't wanna stop, I know I should
But let's do it again

One more time,
Let's do it again
The thing you did,
Do it again
And when it arrives, the moment before
The anticipation, you know it's like Mmm-Mmm-mmm
Wait for it, wait for the build up
And then let's do it again

We do what we want, and as soon as it's done
We just do it again
Let's do it all, and when we come down
We just do it again
Don't care what they say, it hurts so good
I don't wanna stop, I know I should

We should not be friends
We'll just do it again
If you stay around,
We'll just do it again

We should not be friends
We'll just do it again
If you stay around,
We'll just do it again

Let's do it again
Don't care what they say, it hurts so good
It hurts so good
I don't wanna stop, I know I should
But let's do it again, again again again again
Again again again again

// Every Little Thing //

Been alone in here forever
Waiting in the dark
If you only knew me better
Opened up your heart

Hey
Every little thing I say
Every little thing I do
You should really know by now
Baby
Every little thing I say
Every little thing I do
You should really know by now
It's for you

I've been waiting here forever
For you to come inside
Even though I never told ya
God knows how I tried

Hey
Every little thing I say
Every little thing I do
You should really know by now
Baby
Every little thing I say
Every little thing I do
You should really know by now
It's for you

Baby
Why you fought it
When you know I'm waiting
When you know I'm waiting here

Baby
Why you fought it
When you know I'm waiting
When you know I'm waiting here

Baby
Why you fought it
When you know I'm waiting
When you know I'm waiting here

Baby
Why you fought it
When you know I'm waiting
When you know I'm waiting here
