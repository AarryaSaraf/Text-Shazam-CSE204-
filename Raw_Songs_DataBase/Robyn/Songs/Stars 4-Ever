You and me together -

Stars forever 
Stars forever 
Stars forever 
Stars forever 



You and me on the hood

On my car

Saturday night

Watching the stars 
Watching the stars 



You and I

Shinning lights to what we are

Look at the sky

And I am never far


I can be right there next to you

No matter where in the world you are

I got you right here next to me

Forever connected through the stars


It's what we are...


You and me together -

Stars forever 
Stars forever 
Stars forever 
Stars forever 



The last train's gone

We walk through the night

The moon shines down

Like a spotlight 
Like a spotlight 



You and I

Shinning lights to what we are

Look at the sky

And I am never far


I can be right there next to you

No matter where in the world you are

I got you right here next to me

Forever connected through the stars


It's what we are...


You and me together -

Stars forever 
Stars forever 
Stars forever 
Stars forever 



(It's what we are)


You and me together -

Stars forever 
Stars forever 
Stars forever 
Stars forever 



I can be right there next to you

I can be right there next to you

Forever connected through the stars

It's what we are


You and me together -

Stars forever 
Stars forever 
Stars forever 
Stars forever 



We're superstars


You and me together -

Stars forever 
Stars forever 
Stars forever 
Stars forever 



Stars forever
