In the mind 
of no one
Forming sun
Forming love
Break the chain
Hide within
Innocence
Not innocent
Innocent
In no sense
Eat the beast
Keep him in
Take the blame
Speak the name

LUNACY

Hide beneath
Your monkey skin
Feel his love
Nurture him
Kill the truth
Or speak the name

LUNACY

Your childhood is over (is over)
