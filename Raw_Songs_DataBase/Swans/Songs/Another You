I'll walk fifteen steps across the room
I'll stay there until I know where I am
I won't move until I know where I am
I won't move until I (until I) remember where I am (until I)
I won't move until I remember (remember)
Until I (until I) remember (remember)
I should have hurt you (I should have hurt you)
I couldn't hurt you (I couldn't hurt you)
So I let you hurt me (so I let you hurt me)
Because I need you (because I need you)
