I'll lie to myself
I'll lie to myself
I'll lie down here
I'll lie down here
I'll Lie down beside you
I'll Lie down beside you
I'll lie to myself
I'll lie to myself
I'll believe in myself
I'll believe in myself
I'll believe in a lie
I'll believe in a lie
I'll believe in a lie
I'll believe in myself

I'll cut off my right hand and stand in your shadow
I'll cut off my right hand and stand in your shadow
I'll lie to myself
I'll lie to myself
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go

I'll crawl all over myself and stand in your shadow
I'll crawl all over myself and stand in your arms
I'll lie to myself
I'll lie to myself
