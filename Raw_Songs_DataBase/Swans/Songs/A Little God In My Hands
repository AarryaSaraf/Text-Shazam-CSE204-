Pink little lamb, on a granite slab
Black chasm creeping, forever leaking
Oh universe: Sing in reverse
Oh sucking lung: We'll never come
Forever loving! Forever waiting!
Oh yeah! 
Oh yeah!
The universal mind!

Eye full of sun, hand full of mud
Oh universe: you stink of love!
Forever lazy, forever crazy
Forever holy, forever hungry
Forever hateful, forever beautiful
Forever needing, forever reaching
Forever stinking, forever breathing
Forever growing, forever leaving

Oh shit and blood! Forever love!
No ebb or flood, will ever come!
Oh shit and blood! Forever love, love, love!
Forever draining, forever leaving
What's my name? 
What's my name?
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
The universal mind!
