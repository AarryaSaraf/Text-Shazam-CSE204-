In the place where you lay
In the shimmer above
In the rust and the oil
With your mouth full of mud
You run like a child
Through curtains of rain
In a room made of stone
Your future was made
There's nowhere to run to
You forget where you've been
Your shadow is shrinking
In the tightening lens
How many more years?
How much time is there left?
All the rivers reversed
While you counted each step

In the veins of the tree
In the strata beneath
In the polished chrome sheen
In the rebar and conrete
Reach up for the hand
Of the glowing half-man
Stand still on the edge
Of the greased precipice
Reach out
In a tunnel of steel
Fall through
It's coming, it's real
Breathe in
The glittering dust
Exhale
Mindless

Rage on, helpless
Reach out, sightless
Kneel down, fearless
Rise up, righteous
Save us, formless
Reach out, mindless
Save us, lightless
Leave us, soundless
Rise up, righteous
Save us, formless
Reach out, mindless
Save us, lightless
Rage on, fearless
Leave us, soundless
Leave us, soundless
Save us, lightless
Reach out, mindless
Save us, formless
Rise up, righteous
Kneel down, fearless
Reach out, sightless
Rage on, soundless
