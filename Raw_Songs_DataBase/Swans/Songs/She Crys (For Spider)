You can hear them out there
They're gonna follow you down
On the rocks
In the air
Inside your mind, they made you scared
Of all the lies that have been told
Of all the hearts now that have been sold
Of all the tears that've been disowned
Those cries are gonna swallow up
The seeds you have sown

So hold on and make it last
Hold on for your last holy breath
Hold on for your faith
It has lapsed

Those cries like an acid
They will eat through your mask
Those cries like a hammer
They will nail down your past
Those cries gonna swallow up
Your last dying gasp

You can hear them out there
They come inside and ride you slow
They come inside where they will grow
Without a hope, without a dream
Without anything
Without a demon to turn the key

Of all the lies now that have been told
Of all the hearts now that have been sold
Of all the tears that've been disowned
Those cries are gonna swallow up the seeds you have sown
Those cries gonna get ya, chill you down to the bone
Those cries like an acid they will eat through your mask
Those cries gonna swallow up your last dying gasp

So hear them now
All the dead-eyed souls who've spent their lives and just grown old
So hear the cries from the dead-eyed souls who've spent their lives
Now they're turning cold
