While drinking your lake
While sucking your star
The closer I come
The further you are
There is no constraint
There is no because
There is no reward
But there's a place just for us

Run your hands through my soil
Feed your blood through my skull
Fold back my skin
And wash me with oil
White bird in your mouth
Chewed powder of time
Now scattered in clouds
Over fields washed with lime

I am asking you this
I am asking you this
What made us like this?
Who made us like this?

While stealing my dreams
While clawing my skies
Please open my chest
Please curl in my nest
My tongue will turn black
From tasting your spit
From drinking the sweat
From the dip in your neck
Infections they spread
They can never be fixed
Now I'm thinking your thoughts
You're wearing my lips
If God is around
It is him that we kiss
While tying my binds
You're asking me this

What made us like this?
Who made us like this?
I am asking you this
Who made us like this?
