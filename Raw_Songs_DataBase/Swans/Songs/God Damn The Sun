When, when we were young, we had no history 
So nothing to lose meant we could choose 
Choose what we wanted then
Without any fear or thought of revenge 

But then you grew old and I lost my ambition 
So I gained an addiction to drink and depression 
(They are mine, my only true friends 
And I'll keep them with me until the very end)

I'd choose not to remember, but I miss your arrogance 
And I need your intelligence and your hate for authority 
But now you're gone, I read it today
They found you in Spain, face down in the street 
With a bottle in your hand and a wild smile on your face 
And a knife in your back

You died in a foreign land and they found my letter 
Rolled up in your pocket 
Where I said I'd kill myself if she left me again 
So now she's gone and you're both in my mind 
I've got one thing to say before I am drunk again

Goddamn the sun 
Goddamn the sun 
Goddamn anyone that says a kind word 
Goddamn the sun
Goddamn the sun 
Goddamn the light
It shines and this world it shows 
Goddamn the sun
