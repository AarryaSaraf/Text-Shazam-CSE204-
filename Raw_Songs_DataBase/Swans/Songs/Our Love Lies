We'll fall down
On broken knees
And we'll cry for you now
We'll cry for your mercy
We believe in love
We believe in love
God save us now
We believe in love
We degrade ourselves
But we dig our own grave
Jesus Christ the Lord
Save us now
We believe in love
We believe in love
God save us now
We believe in love
You said all my life
Would be in vain
If I gave up on anything
I knew to be true
Or a provable lie
So I believe in love
I believe in love
God save us now
I believe in love
And I open the door
And there they lie twisted
And misshapen
They suffer for love
And they're sick to death
Of the dreams they used to have
And they're sick to death
Of their beautiful lie
God save us now
God save us now
God save us
Please
Save us now
We believe in love
We believe in love
God save us now
We believe in love
God save us
Please
