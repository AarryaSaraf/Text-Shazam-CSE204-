See God's sun go down behind that hill
See God's sons go down that lonely road 
See God's sun fall behind that hill in darkness 
See God's sons go down that godforsaken road 

Then see us need more 
Then see no more 
Then see no more 
Then see no more 

See us deliver where other men will fail 
See us hold Heaven while others burn in Hell 
See us, God's sons, guarding Heaven's gate
Then see our sun go black because we made one mistake 

Then see us need more 
Then see no more
Then see no more 
Then see no more
