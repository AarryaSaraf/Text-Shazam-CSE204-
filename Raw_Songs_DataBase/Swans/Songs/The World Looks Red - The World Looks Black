Push it away
The world looks red
People wish fish eyes
The ground sucks

Walk on my fingertips
Displacing the fog
The weight of my body is too much to bear
The memory drains the life from a dog

An ocean of insects works like a sheet
The immevoable fact buries my mind
In a horse-hair coat in a pile on the floor

Bury my mind
Bury mind
Bury my mind
Bury my mind

Follow the Sleeper Man
Follow the Maker Man
Follow the Keeper Man
Follow the Leaver Man

Follow the Sleeper Man
Follow the Sleeper Man
Follow the Sleeper Man
Follow the Sleeper Man
