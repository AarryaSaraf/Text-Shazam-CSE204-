I live in an empty house
There's no one there but memory and me

But I loved a woman once
One hundred years ago, for a while
When she left here, she was filled with hatred
And with a second child

Now, I heard nothing ever changes
But nothing I touch has stayed the same
Everything just turns to poison
That I have loved or made

So bury my children's children
In a deep and lonely grave
Anything is a cause for sorrow
That my mind or body has made

There's a fire on the water
There's a hole in the sky
There's the Devil coming down for me
To this room where I'll die

There's a man with a black heart
He's standing there up on the hill
He's lifting up with his burning hands
A fire that does not kill

He's calling down to me alone
He's calling down to me alone
He says, "Get down on your knees and cry alone
No one will cry for you"

So Jane Mary, cry one tear
Jane Mary, cry just one tear for me
Jane Mary, cry one tear
Jane Mary, cry just one tear for me
