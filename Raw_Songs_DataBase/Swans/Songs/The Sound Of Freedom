We're standing by a river
In a place where nothing moves
And the white light in the sky
Is meaningless and cruel

And we turn our face away
From a cold and violent wind
And we bow our heads down
And we pray to the sound of freedom

With a mirror in my hand
And my eyes burned in the fire
Drunk on self-deception
And punished by desire

Leaping directly into a bright white sea
I'll keep myself breathing
And I'll swallow the sound of freedom

Nobody else can see you
Nobody knows how you feel
Go further inside you
Where nothing else is real

Now throw yourself into a pool of silence you can see
And hold the mirror before your eyes
And light the white light
It's the sound of freedom

Now time is just a picture
That moves before your eyes
And every lie that I believe
Is falsely compromised

And this is not a sound
And we are not alive
Someone else was here before
In someone else's mind

And the ground we walk is sacred
And every object lives
And every word we speak
Will punish or forgive

And the light inside your body
Will shine through history
Set fire to every prison
Set every dead man free

And the air we're breathing now
We breathed a million times
And the darkest dreams we dreamed
Were dreamed by other minds

So take us to the water
Take us to the sound
And wash my soul away
Where it can never be found

And the white light that surrounds us
Is the sound of freedom pounding
And the ground that opens up
Spits the fire from freedom's mouth

And the concrete, glass and steel
Break with a freedom you can feel
And the wind that blows through Heaven
It screams the sound of freedom

And the violence that destroys
Is the birth of freedom singing
And the lovers in the field
Make the sound of freedom bleeding

And the pain that eats my mind
Is the shout of freedom's life
And the sea that splits in two
Is the cut of freedom's knife

And the fire that burns this city
Is the white light in freedom's eye
And the white light is the sound of freedom
