Why be ashamed of hatred
There's nothing wrong with burning
I work hard for everything I own
Everything I own chokes me when I sleep

Why be ashamed of burning
Why be ashamed of burning
You do what you want
Then you cut out your heart

You do what you want
You burn out your heart
You burn out my heart
Then you eat my heart
You cut out your heart
Then you eat your heart

You burn it
Then eat it
You burn it
Then you eat it
