And I'll sleep in the sea 
And I'll wait there beneath the mud 
And forgotten dreams and disease 
And what's the secret I'll drain from your soul 
And sweet is the sugar I'll drink from your skull 
And where is the wound that shines the blue light 
And who is the dead man my body made love to last night

And I'll sleep in the sea 
And I'll wait there beneath the mud 
And forgotten dreams and disease 
And what's the secret I'll drain from your soul 
And sweet is the sugar I'll drink from your skull
