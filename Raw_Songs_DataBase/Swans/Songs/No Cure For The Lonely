She'll go down there to nowhere soon
She'll stand there still with her head in the moon
I will be her nowhere man
Where I'll remain until the end

That girl was so much better than me
But it always goes wrong
There's no cure for the lonely
With loneliness she'll sink in the sand
I feel the heat go out of her hand

We were born with our face to the wall
We only have one chance to crawl
When we laid down there, I held your hand
I'll never feel your body again

Cut down the preacher, he just lies
Burn all the books that closed my mind
Destroy it all, it's all untrue
How can I even breathe without you?
