I see your face in the mirror
My secret brother, now uncovered
While dissolving into me
I'm breathing into you
Now I'm in you, now I'm injured
Now I'm healing, now I'm clean
Your voice sings inside my mind
Your tongue tastes points in time

Are we sleeping?
Are we drifting?
Are we rising?
Are we shifting?
We're threading tiny lights across the dome of the sky
We ride a single, endlessly unfurling line

I can feel you, I can heal you
I can taste you, I won't lose you...

Your love is deep in my bones
Now they're breaking
Now they're shattered
Do their fragments on the floor
Spell out our future, waiting to be told?

With rough hands and tender breast
White hair and tattooed vest
Now you're reaching, ever seeking
Ever watching your mind unwind
You hide beneath my bed
You sing inside my head

Are we sleeping?
Are we dreaming?
Are we drifting?
Are we leaving?
Hold my hand, be still now
If there's cancer in your blood
It works its way through me too
We're all the same, uncontained
Boiling flesh, unspoken names
Dissolving, contorting
Reforming, distorting
I see your voice in my mind and I am singing
It works its way through my veins
And my hands reach up to the sky
And they're burning as they're circling

I'm your vessel, I am creaming
I'm the avatar of your semen and I'm screaming

Each one of us is fueled with love
With your love to nourish
As you extinguish, I flourish
I'm inside your particles, your cells, and your molecules:
Each one of them is individually screaming
Poor little ones and zeroes:
They're screaming too
Our consciousness is true: it is physical
It is real. It is divisible, and consumed

Through you I can fly
I can fly, I can finally, finally fly

I disappearing mind
True seeker, hold my hand
There is no sky, there is no land
There is no woman, there is no man

Each pain, each love, each regret is sacred
The wounded child is sacred
The murdering man is sacred
The imbecile is sacred
My spit in the dust is sacred
Your lover's sentient hand is sacred
Fucking is sacred
Music is sacred
To give up is sacred
Silence is sacred
Mindlessless is sacred
Sacred, sacred, everything is sacred

Nothing's wasted in our secret
Labyrinthine intestines of time

Through you I create myself
You are my one annihilating thought
Clenched in your fist
I happily cease to exist
Because you destroy me
You are sacred

Every thought is a capsule bursting
Spilling its seeds in space
Each one is sacred
Each one is infinite
Each one dissolves
Dissolving is sacred
Erasing is sacred

I see your voice in my mind and I am flying
I taste your voice on my tongue and I'm singing
You animate my hands and I'm reaching
I see your voice with my eyes, right here
Right now in front of me, misting the air

And I'm flying, and I'm rising
I am flying, I am flying, finally flying
Oh we're flying, finally flying
Yes we're rising, endlessly rising
Oh we're flying, finally flying
And we're riding
Yes we're riding a white lion
And he's flaming, yes he's flaming
And we're flaming
And we're flying, yes we're flying
And we're rising, yes we're rising
And we're riding through the sky
