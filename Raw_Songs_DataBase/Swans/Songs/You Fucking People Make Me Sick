Now diamonds are falling 
the way we will, in the sky. 
Obsessions, pink children, 
they are laid out in a line. 
They are screaming, they are polluted, 
they are demanding their life. 
This wrong feelings, they are calling 
the red leper of time. 
I love you, I need you, 
oh show me how to shine. 
I love you, young flower, 
now give me what is mine.
