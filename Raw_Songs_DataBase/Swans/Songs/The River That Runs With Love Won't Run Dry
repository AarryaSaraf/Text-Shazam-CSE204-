Oh my father, he was born beneath the water 
And my mother, she was born to no one's daughter 
And I, I was born beneath the dying sun 
Born from the mouth of a river that would not run dry 

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la lie 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la lie 
Oh, the river that runs with love, it won't run dry 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la lie 

Well, I awoke this morning in the blackest night 
And a million stars were aching in the sullen sky 
And I heard the great machines as they bled and cried 
And I saw the end of the world, I had no question why 

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la lie 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la lie 
Hold on to the one you love and kiss her before she dies 
Oh, the river that runs with love, it won't run dry

Oh, my father made the water when he cried
But the river that runs with love, it won't run dry
And the sun will burn a hole in the purple sky 
But the river that runs with love, it won't run dry
