I'll live forever, I'll never be filled
I'll never imagine I can change what I killed
I destroy what I love, I drain what is filled
And I live by the heart of the things I kill

I will be alive for a thousand years
This memory will never leave, this body won't die
This body is a temple stolen from the Lord
I'll walk in his shadow for a thousand years

This is the gift I was given at birth
I'll walk in your shadow for a thousand years
One thousand years
