When other people say you're someone to misuse 
Shut in behind your young girl's face 
And helpless in your bed of thorns 
I'll remember who you are 
Yes, I'll remember who you are 
I'll remember who you are
A young girl, unchained 

Come back here now 
I know you're somewhere still alive 
Strong behind your young girl's tears 
I know you're somewhere, unchanged

Oh, I remember who you are
Yes, I remember who you are 
I remember who you are
A young girl, unchained 

There stands a young girl, naked 
In her innocence unused 
And she holds me in her small hand 
And she smiles down on me 

I am innocent in her dark eyes 
I will lose my heart in the sand 
You're cruel, but you're good for me 
And you hold me in your young girl's hand 

I remember who you are 
Yes, I remember who you are 
I remember who you are 
A young girl, unchained
