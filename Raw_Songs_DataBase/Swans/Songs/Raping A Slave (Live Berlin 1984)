Why be ashamed of hatred?
There's nothing wrong with burning

You do what you want
You cut out my heart

I work hard for everything I own
Everything I own chokes me when I sleep

You do what you want
You burn out my heart

Why be ashamed of burning?
Why be ashamed of burning?

You burn out my heart
Then you eat out my heart
And you cut out your heart
And you burn out your heart
Then you burn it out

Oh, burn out
Oh, why?
Why be ashamed of your hatred?
Why? Why? Why?
Why be ashamed of your blood?
When you burn, when you burn it out
When you eat my heart
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, be ashamed, oh be ashamed
Burn out, please burn it out
Oh, please!
Shut it out

You burn it
Then eat it
You burn it
Then you eat it
Then you burn it
Then you eat it
Then you eat it
Then you eat it
Then you eat it
Why?
