Some men are made of steel and blood 
Some fall from Heaven when their time does come
Some of us, we run from a shapeless form 
And some men, they hide from a howling storm 

Now I will wander through the falling flames
And I will drown in the burning rain 
Sha la la la la la la, let it come down 
Sha la la la la la la, let it come down 

There is a place with nothing to gain 
There lies the lover who has broken no chain
He sits by the window and he stares at the dark
She feels for the knife that will split his heart 

Now we are betrayed in the cold, black pain
And a fire will rain down again and again 
Sha la la la la la la, let it come down 
Sha la la la la la la, let it come down
