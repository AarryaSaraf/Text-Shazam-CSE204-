Your lipstick smear across your face
Now toss your hair in dirty grace
Pink leather strap on your guitar
Now spread your legs - how bright you are
Mmmmmm... they all know your name
Mm - Cully, claw your way to - mm - fame

There's a star in her eyes and she knows it
There's a star in her mind yeah she chose it
There's a star in her eyes and she knows it
There's a star in her mind yeah she chose it
And every evening the sun comes up when she goes down
And every evening the mud fills up her bridal gown

The little girl inside of you
Has made her wish come true
And tonight you take the stage
You wear a dress of blood and lace
You left a stain where you have kneeled
But Cully you're still invisible

There's a star in her eyes and she knows it
There's a star in her mind yeah she chose it
There's a star in her eyes and she knows it
There's a star in her mind yeah she chose it
And every evening the sun comes up when she goes down
And every evening the mud fills up her bridal gown

Your lipstick smear across your face
Now toss your hair in dirty grace
Pink leather strap on your guitar
Now spread your legs just like a star

And I'd like to eat her breasts and know God
(There's a star in her eyes)
And I'd like to taste her flesh and grow hard
(There's a star in her eyes)
And I'd like to eat her breasts and grow God
(There's a star in her eyes)
And I'd like to suck her breath and blow hot
(There's a star in her eyes)

And I'd like to eat her breasts and know God
(There's a star in her eyes)
And I'd like to taste her flesh and grow hard
(There's a star in her eyes)
And I'd like to eat her breasts and grow God
