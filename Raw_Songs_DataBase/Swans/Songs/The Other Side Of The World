I won't think it
I won't speak it
But I feel it
And I see it

And it comes down and surrounds us
With sensation
With perfection
Without purpose

And there's colour
And there's light
And there's movement
On the other side of the world

With each movement
New reactions cause sensations
Which move through us
And the warm wind kissed your body

And the sun was rising on the other side of the world
And there's colour
And there's light and sensation
On the other side of the world

Now I breathe it
And I see it before thinking
And it's perfect
Without purpose

And there's colour
And there's light
And they're rising
On the other side of the world
