Standing naked in the corner
Sinking into the ground
Our hands connected to our feet
Our shadows burnt into the wall
Like the insomniac dreams:

Getting taken to the basement
Getting fucked to ease some tension
Getting taken to the basement
Getting fucked to ease some tension

Connecting tongues in the basement
X's tongue move moves down Y's throat
Y spits it back and fills X
Stalemate
Tied together in a permanent knot
Pressed together into one face

Throat:
Getting taken to basement
Getting fucked to ease some tension
