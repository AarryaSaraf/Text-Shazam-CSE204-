These are the hands
that hold the sun
this is the water
where our life was first begun

these are the eyes
that saw you lying there

And this is the mind
that will always remember

I hold your hand 
with a heavy heart of lead
the sky is black and gold
and the moon is shining red

I see you Mary Anne
but I'm not really here

I see you Mary Anne
what have I become?

This is the sound
of a world without a name
and here is the ocean
where history was raised
and I was a young man
sailing on the sea
and this was a new world
and every child was free

No we're not standing here
on the poison shore

Love is the empty place
where loneliness is born

I see you Mary Anne
We never knew ourselves

I see you Mary Anne

We're not really here

I see yourÂ  (anyone know?)

What have we become?
