And all across America
The poison fires glow
And in the blood of our procreation
Annihilation grows

Yes, love was made for slaves like us
Designed to fetishize
Consumption, waste and an identity
Based on a dying lie

So God forgive America
The end of history is now
And God may save the victim
But only the murderer holds real power

We came across the seas
We'd fill with offal and disgust
And any object industry required
We bought, enslaved or we crushed

And now our minds are as naked
As the paradise we stripped
And our reward is our entropy
Our emptiness is our gift

So God forgive America
And every human on this Earth
And God forgive the ruined lives
And nothing is what it's worth
