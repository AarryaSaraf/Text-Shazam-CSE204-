I saw a white finger on a barbed wire fence
I knew it was dangerous but I took the risk
And yes it was sweet so sweet to eat
Now see how the flesh is pricked and bleeds
Yeah it bleeds
Yeah yeah it bleeds
It bleeds
See how it bleeds

I saw a little baby a-crawling down the street
I said hey come over baby 'cos you look good enough to eat
I said come over dear and you know what I'll do
Well I'll make you a mirror of the things that I chew
Little yum yab, little yum yab

We are the wild, we are the risk
Come little yum yab, come slash your wrist
We are the wild, we are the risk
Come little yum yab, gimme a kiss
We are the wild, we are the risk
Come little yum yab, come slash your wrist
We are the wild, we are the risk
Come little yum yab, gimme a kiss

And blow your brains out
Blow your brains out
Blow your brains out
Blow your brains out
Blow your brains out
And blow your brains out
Now blow your brains out
And blow your brains out
