In separate sections,
The bodies fall.
The leaves are purple,
The grass is red.
I love your music.
I love your style.
The light inside you
Leaks through your eyes.
Na na na na....

The golden liquid
That washed your face,
Contain my secrets
And bitter taste.
I love your music.
I love your throat.
The light inside me
Feeds like a golden rope.
Na na na na...

And I alone,
See through your eyes.
And I alone,
Will never die.
And I alone,
Can taste your hand.
And I alone,
Am sanctified.
And I alone,
Can smell your hair.
And I alone,
Feed you the air.
And I alone,
Can steal steal your breath,
And I alone,
Prevent your death.
And I alone,
Am not alone.
And I alone,
Am not alone...
Na na na na na...

It's the sun
It's the sun
Sh-sh-shining
Sh-sh-shining...
Shhhh....
Shhhh....
