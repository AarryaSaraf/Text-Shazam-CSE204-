// Better Than You //

I'm so glad I'm better than you
I'm so glad I'm better than you are
I'm so glad I'm better than you
I'm so glad I'm better than you are

Sit here. Now look in the mirror
Something's wrong, your face is distorted
Feel the flow: there's blood in your body
And you can see clearly every heartbeat you make

Close your eyes, touch your mouth in the mirror
That's the wound that is made where the past meets the future
I'm so glad I'm better than you
I'm so glad I'm better than you are

I can see clearly through this veil of reality
And I can remember the feel of your skin
No, you never knew me and you never will
When nothing's there, nothing is concealed

I'm so glad I'm better than you
I'm so glad I'm better than you are
I'm so glad I'm better than you
I'm so glad I'm better than you are

// Power And Sacrifice //

I want power, because it feels good
I want power - I'll wash America with blood
I want power: a clear blue light in the sky
I feel power, running through my veins and out my eyes

And into empty, godforsaken minds without reality
I feel power, I feel a sacrifice
I am dead to right or wrong

I want power, just like our father knew
I want power, I'll put my hands in you
I want power, though the Earth is lost and spinning
I feel power, buried in the ground
Where twenty million died like heroes
Stealing this same power that I'm feeling

I feel power, I feel a sacrifice
Now my blood is feeling clean
And I feel the power burning like a spear inside of me
I feel good, I feel right, I feel a sacrifice

// You Know Nothing //

And nothing is written in the book, reality is made by you
And every lie that you pursue, eventually turns true
And I was told that your eyes would shine a light up into space
And infinity would then consume this ordinary place

You know nothing, you know nothing at all
How could you know, you'll never know anything at all
You'll never know, you'll never know anything at all
You know nothing, you know nothing at all

I saw you standing in the fire, beneath a crimson moon
The ocean whispered on the shore and echoed in the ruins
Inside your body is a clear blue light and time was made from this
Your shadows swallow everything it feels, you punish us with bliss

You know nothing, you know nothing at all
How could you know, you'll never know anything at all
You'll never know, you'll never know anything at all
You know nothing, you know nothing at all

// Song For Dead Time //

Now the past is untrue, and this breath is a lie
And the sun is an emptiness that burns through the sky
And this ground - it will slide down, down into the sea
And when this body dies, no man will ever breathe one word of ignorance for me
So bury your trust beneath the ground with me
And lay your loneliness down for the sun to consume

Now the earth bleeds cold water in my open hands
But their bodies bleed poison and they swallow the sand
And we'll walk to the river, where we will die of a thirst
And my fate, it's no question
Every fool, he is broken beneath the same holy curse

So bury your trust beneath the ground with me
And lay your loneliness down for the sun to burn to sand

// Will We Survive //

I'll drink the moonlight from your hands
I'll swim an ocean filled with sorrow
No lover, please don't go
We can crucify tomorrow

Let the sunlight feed the air
Let it fill our lungs with lies
We'll be memorized by shadows
But our loneliness will survive

Now the sugar in your soft voice
Makes the sweetness in your weeping
And the black rose that you swallowed
Feeds the solitude you're dreaming

No, I'll never taste your tears again
In the darkness that we're breathing in
Now the sun will kill the garden
In a universe that is bleeding

// Love Will Save You //

Love will save you when the ocean splits itself in two
Love will save you when the cold wind blows right through you
Love will save you when the poison eats the precious air
And love will save you from the snake that crawls around down there
But it won't save me

Love will save you from the evil and the greed of ignorant men
And love will save you from the guilt you feel when you betray your only friend
Love will save you from yourself when you lose control
And love will save you from all the lies your lover ever told you
But it won't save me

Love will save you from the truth when you think you're free
Love will save you from the cold light of boring reality
Love will save you from the corruption of your lazy-minded soul
And love will save you from your selfish and distorted goals
But it won't save me

Love will save you from the black night and the lightning and the ghost
Love will save you from your misery, then tie you to the bloody post
Love will save you from the hands that pull you down beneath the sea
Love may save all you people, but it will never, never save me
No, it won't save me

// Failure //

I, I've been lonely
And I, I've been blind
And I, I've learned nothing
So my hands are firmly tied
To the sinking leadweight of failure

I've worked hard all my life
Money slips through my hands
My face in the mirror tells me it's no surprise
That I'm pushing the stone up the hill of failure

They tempt me with violence
They punish me with ideals
And they crush me with an image of my life that's nothing but unreal
Except on the goddamned slaveship of failure

I'll drown here trying to get up for some air
But each time I think I breathe
I'm laid on with a double share
Of the punishing burden of failure

I don't deserve to be down here
But I'll never leave
And I've learned one thing
You can't escape the beast
In the null and void pit of failure

When I get my hands on some money
I'll kiss its green skin
And I'll ask its dirty face
"Where the hell have you been?"
"I am the fuel that fires the engine of failure"

I'll be old and broken down
I'll forget who and where I am
I'll be senile or forgotten
But I'll remember and understand
You can bank your hard-earned money on failure

I saw my father crying
I saw my mother break her hand on a wall that wouldn't weep
But that certainly held in
The mechanical moans of a dying man who was a failure

My back hurts me when I bend because I carry a load
My brain hurts me like a knife-hole
Because I've yet to be shown
How to pull myself out from the sucking quicksand of failure

Some people live in Hell
Many bastards succeed
But I, I've learned nothing
I can't even elegantly bleed
Out the poison blood of failure

// Song For The Sun //

The sun is rising over the buildings across the street
The sun is God's face looking down at me as he cries for what he's done
I will survive my life if I close my mind
To all the things I could never, never, never, never, never, never be

You used to be there when I'd cry
Though you'd not see fit to comfort me
I don't need you anyway, and I'll never call you back to me
But I miss the way your body looks when you lay there naked next to me

But I won't cry, no, I will survive the light of the sun as it enters me
Let it come right in, let the sun come in
Let the sun come in, let it come in
Let it come on it, let the sun come in
Let the sun come in, let it come in

Now they say that Hell is a place where memory's dead
And the only thing left is this moment moving further away
But I will always try to remember the way you moved your lips
Against mine in the lonely bed
If I forget who you were then, I will lose what I am now
Forever and ever and ever and ever again

But I won't cry, no, I will survive the light of the sun as it enters me
Let it come right in, let the sun come in
Let the sun come in, let it come in
Let it come on it, let the sun come in
Let the sun come in, let it come in

// Miracle Of Love //

She holds a key to the room down there
And I, I will follow, but I'll never fall in
Yeah, we'll suffer for nothing and we'll never forgive
God said to no one to do what he did

One second in your presence is a miracle of love
One second denied is a miracle of love

The young man is weakness in a lover's disguise
The woman is strong in her warm, bitter lies
How will they hope what they can never perceive
And how do they love what they fail to deceive

One second in your memory is a miracle of lies
One heartbeat in your body is a miracle of love
White light on a black sky is a miracle from above
One lonely moment in your arms is a miracle of love

// When She Breathes //

When she comes here, then we'll see
Then we'll know, then we'll breathe
In her shadow, the sun was born
In her shadow, a new world will form

When she breathes, when she breathes
When she imagines that she breathes in me
When she breathes, when she thinks it once
In the field, steel grass will grow

And from Heaven, she'll rain down the sun
And turn the living into sand
And we breathe her holy air
And we walk this poison place

Made from an emptiness where time was never
Dreamed by one mind so sad as mine
When she breathes, when she breathes
When she thinks it once, when she breathes in me

// Why Are We Alive? //

Now I'm not a man and I don't feel love
And I don't see anything coming down from above
But this world spins slowly and I see a light
Rising up from behind the horizon up into the clear black sky
But I don't see you in my line of sight
In fact, I can't remember why we are alive

// The Most Unfortunate Lie //

Someone was here before me
And they took the possibility away
And without any control or freedom
The elements were laid down in this way

And so my mind is slowly devoured
By the ideas to which it subscribes
And in the end, I'm left with nothing
Except the memory of believing my own lies
And where are you now, my most unfortunate lie

The light shows my face in the mirror
And my hand as it reaches to touch
The evidence of pain and delusion
And a mind which was never clear enough

I saw the sun rise in an ancient desert
Where this moment was first foretold
And the black water was thick as blood
And my hands, they were full of gold

And where are you now, the most lethal, all-consuming lie I ever told
Where are you now, my unfortunate, irreversible lie
