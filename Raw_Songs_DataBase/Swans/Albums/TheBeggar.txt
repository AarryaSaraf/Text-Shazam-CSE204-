// Paradise Is Mine //

Now we lay in the mud
In the sea, deep beneath
And we wait where we lay
For the light, for the seed
Of a thought, for a touch
For your breath, for your love
To begin, to unfurl
To create a new world
In the gash, in the break
In this place, you animate
Come to us, penetrate
Come to us, animate
Come to us, from the muck
Learn to speak, learn to fuck
Tongues are trained, fingers reach
Come to us, on the beach
Awake, awake
Awake, to sleep
Awake, awake
Awake, to sleep

Is there really a mind?
Is there really a mind? (Ah)
Is there really a mind? (Ah)
Is there really a mind? (Ah)
Is there really a mind? (Mind)
Is there really a mind? (Mind)
Is there really a mind? (Mind)
(Mind, mind, mind, mind)
Is it mine? (Mind, mind)
It is mine (Mind, mind)
Is it mine? (Mind, mind)
Mine (Mind)
(Mind, mind)
Am I ready to die? (Mind)
Am I ready to die? (Mind)
Am I ready to die? (Mind)
Am I ready to die? (Mind)
Am I ready to die? (Mind)
Am I ready to die? (Mind)
Is there really a mind? (Mind)
Is there really a mind? (Mind)
Is there really a mind? (Mind)

Paint the time on my eye
It is real, it is mine
This is mine
This is mine
This is mine
Mine

// Los Angeles: City Of Death //

Ah, we're drugged by the sun
Here he comes, here he comes
Just waiting to become
Here he comes, here he comes
Growing in a lung
Here he comes, here he comes
Gathering our tongues
Here he comes, here he comes

Tunneling the ground
Swallowing this sound
Injecting insect dreams
That he's singing into being
Please open up your hands
You woman, child and man

Here he comes, here he comes
Here we come, here I am

Sucking colors from the root
Of the syphilis fruit
Flattening this land
Scattering the sand
Burning every tree
Burning every book
Pulverizing the ruins
Of the city that he shook
Flooding through the gates
Screaming through the wires
Flashing in the screen
Swimming in the fire
Inhaling everything
That ever was or will become
Gathering us in
To undo what he has done

Here he comes, here he comes
Here he comes, here he comes
Here he comes, here he comes
Here he comes, here we run
Run!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Become!
Become!
Run!
Run!
