Album: LeavingMeaning

// Amnesia //

The sun is an acid eye
We're corroded with pleasure inside
There's a hole in your thin white skin
Now we'll never be clean again

Our hands are two broken claws
We scrape at the ground for hours
I buried this sound in the floor
To gain control of this feeling

Amnesia

And this city's a crowded room
The earth is a closing tomb
My hand is a perfect womb
When you breathe, your breath is obscene

My heart is a lead box
Ideas are shutting locks
The air was just turned off
Now you're sucking from this machine

Amnesia
Amnesia

The sun will not rise today
You children will stay where you lay
The oil is black and it's thick
And sex is a void filled with plastic

The President's mouth is a whore
When there's murder, the audience roars
There's no room left here for the strong
And everything human's necessarily wrong

Wrong
Wrong
Wrong
Wrong
Wrong
Wrong
Wrong

Amnesia

// Annaline //

Right here and right now
The first night of our life
I'm somewhere in you
And I'll never get out
It's sucking us in
My impossible friend
How is it true
That we even exist?

I'll follow you down
With our limbs interlocked
Oh the Buddha was right
And St John of the cross
A word is a thought
And a thought is a box

Let's burn in a fire
Oh let's clean what is true
Let me sink in your bed
Folded in you

Pulling us down
With hands made of light
Pushing us through
A window in time
Slipping into
A spiralling line
Undoing the knot
Releasing the vines
Annaline
Annaline
Annaline

// The Hanging Man //

I am the hanging man
I hang, I never land
I steal the space between
The filthy and the clean
Healer, come here soon
Come to fill my spoon
Healer, heal my wound
I am a dog: I eat the moon
Healer, heal my lust
Fill my mouth with rust
Healer, hold my hand
Fill my mouth with sand
Healer, kill this lamb
Healer, hang this man!

I am the hanging man
I am the hanging man
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am not I am NOT!
I am NOT! N-N-NOT!

Here I lie, abject
Healer teeth are red
Force my legs apart:
Healer, hold my heart
Healer cut my spine
Healer, eat my mind
Write it on the sky:
These stars reveal the lie
Hold the glowing sphere
There is no there or here
Healer, hold my hand
Healer, hang this man!

I am the hanging man
I am the hanging man
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am not
I am not what I just thought
I am not what I just thought
I am NOT! I am NOT!
We are NOT! NOT!
Not, not
N-N-NOT!

Who is the watcher who is watching this thought
Whose thought is a thought that is not what he thought
NOT! SHOT!
NOT! THOUGHT!
KNOT! NOT!

// Leaving Meaning //

I can see it but not see it
I can feel it but not keep it
I can touch it but not hold it
I can be it but not know it
I can reach it but won't touch it
I contain it but release it
I unfold it but won't see it
I can breathe it but not taste it
I can know it but not show it
I will lose it but I'll keep it
In the shadow, in the light pool
In the reason for not being
I won't touch it, I won't hold it
I can be it but not feel it
I can steal it but not keep it
I can break it but not heal it

Somewhere
No place - let's go!
Nowhere
This place - let's go!
Reaching
Not being - let's go!
Reaching
Not feeling - let's go!
Glorious
No one, no us - let's go!
Glorious
No one, no us - let's go!

// Sunfucker //

Surrender, surrender
Go under bright water
The flooding is coming
Give up to Sun Fucker
The naked, the crawling
They become us while burning

Surrender, surrender
Sun Fucker is calling

We are righteous, we are blighted
We are liquid, ignited
We're stealing your breathing
Your weeping is cleaning
Sun Fucker: True Eater
Sun Fucker: True Blinder

Surrender, surrender
Come home to Sun Fucker
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la little man!

I am the one with feathered plume
Who holds your heart, whose light consumes
With arms stretched out, I gather sky
One thought, one mind:
Sun Fucker eats the blind

Why am I on this earth?
Why am I on this earth?
I worship Sun Fucker!
I worship Sun Fucker!

Fuck me

// Cathedrals Of Heaven //

While drinking your lake
While sucking your star
The closer I come
The further you are
There is no constraint
There is no because
There is no reward
But there's a place just for us

Run your hands through my soil
Feed your blood through my skull
Fold back my skin
And wash me with oil
White bird in your mouth
Chewed powder of time
Now scattered in clouds
Over fields washed with lime

I am asking you this
I am asking you this
What made us like this?
Who made us like this?

While stealing my dreams
While clawing my skies
Please open my chest
Please curl in my nest
My tongue will turn black
From tasting your spit
From drinking the sweat
From the dip in your neck
Infections they spread
They can never be fixed
Now I'm thinking your thoughts
You're wearing my lips
If God is around
It is him that we kiss
While tying my binds
You're asking me this

What made us like this?
Who made us like this?
I am asking you this
Who made us like this?

// The Nub //

Floating, floating
I'm happy to be floating
I'm naked, I'm drifting
In black milk that I'm drinking
I'm licking, I'm sucking
White nipples, while sinking
Oh sweet light, oh mind krill
This throat jerks, this belly fills
Not thinking, gently streaming
I'm dreaming while feeding
I'm sinking, I'm sifting
I'm calling, freely leaking
I'm weeping, I'm seeping
I'm cleaving, while leaching
My disgorger, my forger
We swim in your ordure

Bring bells of bright silver
Bring pillars of glitter
White horses, they're screaming
They're echoes, receding
Calling, they're calling
The angels are calling
Floating, falling
Calling, calling

// It's Coming It's Real //

In the place where you lay
In the shimmer above
In the rust and the oil
With your mouth full of mud
You run like a child
Through curtains of rain
In a room made of stone
Your future was made
There's nowhere to run to
You forget where you've been
Your shadow is shrinking
In the tightening lens
How many more years?
How much time is there left?
All the rivers reversed
While you counted each step

In the veins of the tree
In the strata beneath
In the polished chrome sheen
In the rebar and conrete
Reach up for the hand
Of the glowing half-man
Stand still on the edge
Of the greased precipice
Reach out
In a tunnel of steel
Fall through
It's coming, it's real
Breathe in
The glittering dust
Exhale
Mindless

Rage on, helpless
Reach out, sightless
Kneel down, fearless
Rise up, righteous
Save us, formless
Reach out, mindless
Save us, lightless
Leave us, soundless
Rise up, righteous
Save us, formless
Reach out, mindless
Save us, lightless
Rage on, fearless
Leave us, soundless
Leave us, soundless
Save us, lightless
Reach out, mindless
Save us, formless
Rise up, righteous
Kneel down, fearless
Reach out, sightless
Rage on, soundless

// Some New Things //

And it's lost in a thought
Never seen, never caught
And it's lost in a thought
Never seen, never caught
And it's lost in a thought
Never seen, never caught
And it's lost in a thought
In a sun, in a moon
In a cloud, in the air
In a scream, there's a tear
There's a stab, on a slab
Now the future eats a past
It is shrinking, it is fast
There's a mind, there's a hive
There is life, there is not
There's a name I forgot
There's a breath, not a thought
There's a lake, there's a snake
There's a knife giving life
There's a fool reaching up
To a star that erupts
In a flood rising up
To a nothing that is coming
And it's hungry like a monkey
There is blood in my eye
There is truth in a lie
There's a dog, ease of mind
There's a wire, there's a bind
I perceive, I don't breathe
I become, I'm undone
In the unseen there is love
There is ruin on the one
There's a rip, there's a drift
Stealing bliss from your lip
I'm insane, you're insane
Cut a vein in my brain
There's a trap, there's a catch
There's a golden shining arrow
There's a cancer in a marrow
There's a flame in a hand
There's a kneeling glowing man
There's a rope reaching up
To a sky, to a lie
In a spiral there's a tide
There's a flood, let's give up
There's a hand, there's a mouth
There's a stair winding down
To your chest, to your guts
Fold it in, don't be lost
There's a dream, there's a sheen
There's an endless silver stream
There's a song, now there's not
Never caught, never lost
There's a sound coming now
In a cloud hanging down
Never played, uncontained
And it's growing, and it's flowing
And unfolding, and it's showing
In a lung, in a child
There's a fire running wild
In a mind, on a line
Parallel to a cross
There's a place, I forgot
Never seen, never caught
And it's lost in a thought
Let it out, lay it down
Let it out, lay it down
Let it out, lay it down
Let it out, let it out
Of your mouth let it out
Of your mouth let it out
Of your mouth let it out
Of your mouth let it out
Of your mouth let it out
Of your mouth let it out
Let it out, let it out
Let it out, let it out
Let it out, let it out
Let it out, let it out
...

// What Is This? //

There is a star in my throat
Yeah, a voice, there is hope
In a space inbetween
Runs the milk of relief
If motion is time
I am water, I will rise
To your bed on a cloud
Where you stand
Where you writhe

Painted red, bleeding gold
Your sword
Guts the sun
Flesh is torn
Oceans disgorge your love
We are swimming through
Your moonlight pools
The phosphene tides
The writing on your eyes

We drift through stone
We sift our own powdered bones
We wash, we are clean
What is it now that is thinking this thing?

Where
Are you?
What can you do
To prove you exist?
What
Is this?
Who is this singing
That which no longer exists?

// My Phantom Limb //

I see your face in the mirror
My secret brother, now uncovered
While dissolving into me
I'm breathing into you
Now I'm in you, now I'm injured
Now I'm healing, now I'm clean
Your voice sings inside my mind
Your tongue tastes points in time

Are we sleeping?
Are we drifting?
Are we rising?
Are we shifting?
We're threading tiny lights across the dome of the sky
We ride a single, endlessly unfurling line

I can feel you, I can heal you
I can taste you, I won't lose you...

Your love is deep in my bones
Now they're breaking
Now they're shattered
Do their fragments on the floor
Spell out our future, waiting to be told?

With rough hands and tender breast
White hair and tattooed vest
Now you're reaching, ever seeking
Ever watching your mind unwind
You hide beneath my bed
You sing inside my head

Are we sleeping?
Are we dreaming?
Are we drifting?
Are we leaving?
Hold my hand, be still now
If there's cancer in your blood
It works its way through me too
We're all the same, uncontained
Boiling flesh, unspoken names
Dissolving, contorting
Reforming, distorting
I see your voice in my mind and I am singing
It works its way through my veins
And my hands reach up to the sky
And they're burning as they're circling

I'm your vessel, I am creaming
I'm the avatar of your semen and I'm screaming

Each one of us is fueled with love
With your love to nourish
As you extinguish, I flourish
I'm inside your particles, your cells, and your molecules:
Each one of them is individually screaming
Poor little ones and zeroes:
They're screaming too
Our consciousness is true: it is physical
It is real. It is divisible, and consumed

Through you I can fly
I can fly, I can finally, finally fly

I disappearing mind
True seeker, hold my hand
There is no sky, there is no land
There is no woman, there is no man

Each pain, each love, each regret is sacred
The wounded child is sacred
The murdering man is sacred
The imbecile is sacred
My spit in the dust is sacred
Your lover's sentient hand is sacred
Fucking is sacred
Music is sacred
To give up is sacred
Silence is sacred
Mindlessless is sacred
Sacred, sacred, everything is sacred

Nothing's wasted in our secret
Labyrinthine intestines of time

Through you I create myself
You are my one annihilating thought
Clenched in your fist
I happily cease to exist
Because you destroy me
You are sacred

Every thought is a capsule bursting
Spilling its seeds in space
Each one is sacred
Each one is infinite
Each one dissolves
Dissolving is sacred
Erasing is sacred

I see your voice in my mind and I am flying
I taste your voice on my tongue and I'm singing
You animate my hands and I'm reaching
I see your voice with my eyes, right here
Right now in front of me, misting the air

And I'm flying, and I'm rising
I am flying, I am flying, finally flying
Oh we're flying, finally flying
Yes we're rising, endlessly rising
Oh we're flying, finally flying
And we're riding
Yes we're riding a white lion
And he's flaming, yes he's flaming
And we're flaming
And we're flying, yes we're flying
And we're rising, yes we're rising
And we're riding through the sky
