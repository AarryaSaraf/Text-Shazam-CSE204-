// You Know Everything //

And nothing is written in the book, reality is made by you
And every lie that you pursue, eventually turns true
And I was told that your eyes would shine a light up into space
And infinity would then consume this ordinary place

You know nothing, you know nothing at all
How could you know, you'll never know anything at all
You'll never know, you'll never know anything at all
You know nothing, you know nothing at all

I saw you standing in the fire, beneath a crimson moon
The ocean whispered on the shore and echoed in the ruins
Inside your body is a clear blue light and time was made from this
Your shadows swallow everything it feels, you punish us with bliss

You know nothing, you know nothing at all
How could you know, you'll never know anything at all
You'll never know, you'll never know anything at all
You know nothing, you know nothing at all

Hey hey
Now mother father
Hey hey
Now bloody mind
Hey hey
Now killer father
Hey hey
Now mother mind
Hey hey
Hey yeah yeah yeah
There's a place in space where violence and love collide inside
And solid is wide
And heat it is cold
And birth is death
And creation and time are made from destruction
From fucking destruction
Fucking destruction
Fucking destruction
Fucking destruction
Now ride! ride! ride! ride!
Now ride! ride! ride! ride!
Ride! ride! ride! ride!
Ride!
