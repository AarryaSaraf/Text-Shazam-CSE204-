// I Crawled //

You're my father
I obey you
I want you to be my father
I want you to be my father
You know what I am
You know what I am
I want you to kill me
I'm weak

Take what's mine
Make me feel good
Make me feel soft
Come into my room
Put your hands on my throat
Now choke me
We'll die

Make me nothing
Make me nothing
Be my father
Be my father
Think for me
Make it right
Think for me
Make it right

Put your hands on my throat
Choke me
We'll ride

// Raping A Slave //

Why be ashamed of hatred
There's nothing wrong with burning
I work hard for everything I own
Everything I own chokes me when I sleep

Why be ashamed of burning
Why be ashamed of burning
You do what you want
Then you cut out your heart

You do what you want
You burn out your heart
You burn out my heart
Then you eat my heart
You cut out your heart
Then you eat your heart

You burn it
Then eat it
You burn it
Then you eat it

// This Is Mine //

This is mine
I own it
I own this thing
I hate everything that I don't own

I own this
I own this hole
It's mine
Get out of my hole
It's mine
It's mine

When you touch my things, you spoil them
When things get dirty, I spit them out
I own this
I own this
It's mine
It's mine

// Young God //

I don't know where I am
I'm dancing in my corpse
I don't remember anything

I'm wearing your flesh
Your flesh is my face
I love your face
I wrap your flesh around my face

When I wear your flesh, I love myself
When I wear your flesh, I love face
I wrap your flesh around my flesh
Then I love my flesh

I love your face
All I can do is kill
All I can do is kill
I love your flesh around me
