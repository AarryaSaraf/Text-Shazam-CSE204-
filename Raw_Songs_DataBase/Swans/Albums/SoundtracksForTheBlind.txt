I give you money
You're superior
I don't exist
You control me
You're corrupt
You're deformed
You're corrupt
You control me

Own me
Own me

I'm your property
Own

You're corrupt

Own me

I'm your property

// I Was A Prisoner In Your Skull //

Testing... one, two, three.

Well... well fuck, huh, I mean... I just don't know what to say.
I'm very glad to be here with you tonight, I'll be able to talk to you about some things... that I know a great deal about.
Everyone knows that you are fucked up.
And everyone knows that I am fucked up.
But, does everyone know that you are more fucked up than me?
Well, I know that.
And you know that.
But our purpose is to tell everyone that.

Take for instance, the time... you went to the bathroom to take a shower.
You had some soap, you had a towel, shampoo, washcloth, a brush, everything was set.
But you had to call me to come turn on the water for you.
You didn't know wh, how.
That is one instance of how fucked up you are.

A second instance of how fucked up you are: You was going to cook you some breakfast.
Well you went in there, and put some toast in the toaster, put a skillet on the stove,
some grease in it and got you some eggs out, some bacon.
Poured you some orange juice and made you some coffee.
Got some jelly and some butter.
Fried eggs, salt, pepper, got the bacon all ready.
Everything was fine... except for one thing.
You had to call me in there...to show you how to use a fork.

Now a third instance, the way you're fucked up.
You got dressed, ready to go to school.
Everything was fine... got outside, got in your car.
Key in the ignition.
Except for one thing.
You had to call me to come show you.

// Helpless Child //

Now you be the mother, and
I'll be your fool,
I'll hide myself deep inside,
your crimson pool.

The muddy water runs,
beneath your folds,
you won't let me breathe,
you won't let me go.

Now you be the stranger, and
I'll be the white-skinned son,
you'll blacken my innocence,
with sugar and opium...

The children were suffocating,
down in your damp cave,
and you were the mother,and
I was the sleeping slave.

Protect me from violence,
hold me in your cool lips,
you drug me with kindness,
so I can pretend I exist.

Now you be the only child,
I'll suck on your breast,
you'll feed me with gasoline,
I'll burn my name in your head.

// Yum-Yab Killers //

I saw a white finger on a barbed wire fence
I knew it was dangerous but I took the risk
And yes it was sweet so sweet to eat
Now see how the flesh is pricked and bleeds
Yeah it bleeds
Yeah yeah it bleeds
It bleeds
See how it bleeds

I saw a little baby a-crawling down the street
I said hey come over baby 'cos you look good enough to eat
I said come over dear and you know what I'll do
Well I'll make you a mirror of the things that I chew
Little yum yab, little yum yab

We are the wild, we are the risk
Come little yum yab, come slash your wrist
We are the wild, we are the risk
Come little yum yab, gimme a kiss
We are the wild, we are the risk
Come little yum yab, come slash your wrist
We are the wild, we are the risk
Come little yum yab, gimme a kiss

And blow your brains out
Blow your brains out
Blow your brains out
Blow your brains out
Blow your brains out
And blow your brains out
Now blow your brains out
And blow your brains out

// The Beautiful Days //

Y'know ...
Could do this for fifteen minutes or something
Talk to the man while he masturbates
You know, that was something I think I could, I could do
You know, and of course you don't even, you know, ever meet the man or see the man
You have to listen to him go on and say disgusting things
But I suppose there's things more disgusting if that's the way you're looking at it

// Volcano //

Your lipstick smear across your face
Now toss your hair in dirty grace
Pink leather strap on your guitar
Now spread your legs - how bright you are
Mmmmmm... they all know your name
Mm - Cully, claw your way to - mm - fame

There's a star in her eyes and she knows it
There's a star in her mind yeah she chose it
There's a star in her eyes and she knows it
There's a star in her mind yeah she chose it
And every evening the sun comes up when she goes down
And every evening the mud fills up her bridal gown

The little girl inside of you
Has made her wish come true
And tonight you take the stage
You wear a dress of blood and lace
You left a stain where you have kneeled
But Cully you're still invisible

There's a star in her eyes and she knows it
There's a star in her mind yeah she chose it
There's a star in her eyes and she knows it
There's a star in her mind yeah she chose it
And every evening the sun comes up when she goes down
And every evening the mud fills up her bridal gown

Your lipstick smear across your face
Now toss your hair in dirty grace
Pink leather strap on your guitar
Now spread your legs just like a star

And I'd like to eat her breasts and know God
(There's a star in her eyes)
And I'd like to taste her flesh and grow hard
(There's a star in her eyes)
And I'd like to eat her breasts and grow God
(There's a star in her eyes)
And I'd like to suck her breath and blow hot
(There's a star in her eyes)

And I'd like to eat her breasts and know God
(There's a star in her eyes)
And I'd like to taste her flesh and grow hard
(There's a star in her eyes)
And I'd like to eat her breasts and grow God

// All Lined Up //

I see them all lined up
Like broken children at the wall
Their skin is hanging off in sheets
Each face is painted like a whore
Their blood is shining in the sun
Their wounds are powdered with white salt
Their lips are shedding silent words
I see my name as it spills out
I see them walking on their knees
Led in a chain by laughing girls
I see them sucking on the dirt
As if inhaling the whole world
And one by one their throats are cut
And each one sings his choking song
And each one sings his lullaby
And each one falls and then he's gone
And I feel good
Yeah I feel fine
Yeah I feel good
And I've been waiting far too long

I see their bodies in the pyre
Leaking black smoke into the flames
And all the people stand around
Shaping lips into my name
And soon the sun begins to sink
Behind the wall of dirty air
I see their bones there in the pile
And taste the smell of burning hair
And all the children howl for milk
The rain spits down a million knives
I see you running through the field
I see you running for your useless life
I feel you choking on your tongue
I feel your breath attack your chest
The dogs are ripping at your feet
I see you bleeding out your happiness
And I feel good
Yeah I feel fine
Yeah I feel good
I finally got back what was always, rightfully, mine.

// How They Suffer //

It's not as much a deterioration fact it's the disease I have which er, uh, the- the right eye is blind as you know.
And that was done, er, unfortunately as- as a result of a detached retina.
And the retina they could never splice together.
They tried to seal it together and couldn't, and told me I'd lose my eyesight at that y'know, o- o- o- short or long term I would lose it.
And unfortunately... er the... retinal er ah er a retinal det- detachment started in my left eye, my good eye, which I still have today.
And it was the result of glaucoma... and... a retinal... not detachment but a retinal... er, er,
I don't know what the hell they call it, it's er... that does it.
Today er zer zer I am what they call legally, because of this retinal problem and er glaucoma, er, I- I'm what they call... erm... legally blind.

Today I do not have a fever, I feel about the same as I... did yesterday.
I- I'm trying to eat a little better, so I can get stronger.
(You exercising?)
I'm exercising by just walking around the, around the house.
Went out in the yard just Wednesday.
(You have a headache?)
No, I don't think I have a headache.
(A little dizzy, today?)
Maybe slightly dizzy.
(You feel weaker? Or stronger than you did yesterday?)
Just o- just overnight I don't seem to be much different over one, over one night yesterday to today.
Takes a little bit longer than that.
(Any aches and pains anywhere? Or on when you fell? Or when you fell on your heater, having your exercise?)
Well, that's the, that's sore, about where I fell on the heater.
(Where?)
Here, well I guess here.
(Where is that?)
I dunno what you call that.
(Ain't it hurt when you breathe)
[Cough, cough] It hurts a little bit when I breathe in a little deeply.
(D'you sleep at all?)
Well if you're asleep you can't tell whether you're asleep.

// Animus //

Somewhere through the frozen fields
Somewhere beneath your pale and tender skin
Lies a house absorbing fear and pain
Solar red contained
Feeding on my dreams

Somewhere cold inside the optic wire
Down where fingers and semen crack and bleed
There I will be with my arms spread out and broken
Waiting for your breath to animate my veins

We're not alone: all our thoughts are numbered
Malignant and cold, animal and hungry
But I will contain all that ever was or will be
Then I'll watch my skin erupt in a symphony of flames

Screaming out your name
Screaming out

Why can't I hide inside your malleable electric face?
You'd suck away the pain and swallow down my sickest dreams
Now my body feels like snow spilling out the shattered screen
Where will we be then when all the fear and blood are gone
Drained into one hundred million open children's mouths
Screaming out your name
Screaming out
Screaming out
Out
Out
Out
Out
Out

// Red Velvet Wound //

And what do I do
With the gift you held me as entered me
The one no one else would buy
They would not accept the filthy premise of your most terrible innocence
Oh, oh ho ho
So let them say, how were you wild
For what you really were was tender
Yes how you screamed, all through the night
Yet silent tears streamed down in morning light
Most beautiful, my lonely sinner

// The Sound //

And wide are your delusions
Deep red is the space behind your eyes
Closed forever is the door to your room
But inside there lives the sound
You despise but I love
You despise but I love

You despise
I love
You despise
I love

Mother
I was wrong
I am wrong

// Her Mouth Is Filled With Honey //

Thing is er
We're at a stage now
Last night just before bedtime I wanted to wake you up.
I thought I heard the hi-fi going, the stereo.
And I opened the, living room door and she was pressed down on the, Davenport, with er,
some kind of her, favorite music going, and had, er, incense burning, and er the lights out, lying in the dark.
I guess she was mooning over that boyfriend.

// Hypogirl //

Can I steal your mind?
And can I crawl down inside?
And when I am your child
Can I feed in your eye?
And can I drink the air
Down in your cold black lung?
And can I breath the sweet
Sick and lonesome blood?
Love is everywhere
No we will never escape
I love you more than my life
No, we will never escape

Can I cut out the core
And steal the food in your head
And curl my body inside
Down where it's dark and it's wet?
I love you more than your life
I love your body and mind
I love you more than your life
No, we will never escape

// Minus Something //

There's been a lot of upsetting, very upsetting things that I can't allow to happen any more.
I have to be like a soldier and march away.
'Cause I'm very delicate in a lot of ways, and things get to me, and affect me in a very adverse... manner.
I don't need that; don't need that.
I feel now like minus something, you know, I feel faded; I don't feel like I'm all here.
I think it'll come back; I hope it'll come back.
There's a lot of color missing, from the way I feel, and from... my face, and, you know, just everything.
There's some kind of zest, or some kind of, um... life, you know, that seems to be faded temporarily,
because I've been so drained, emotionally, by a number of things.
That has to slowly build back up, and then it has to be kept sustained; it cannot be allowed to be diminished.

// Empathy //

You were wrong to resist me
I was wrong to forgive
Now I loathe my own weakness
But you praise me for this

There's a place in your future
Where the wound will be healed
And the children you injured
Will rise up, purified, then kill your name

You're afraid of the mirror
So you crawl on the floor
Where you count your perversions
Then you rise up, filthy, with remorse
Uh huh huh
Uh huh huh
Uh huh huh
Uh
Uh
Uh
Uh

// The Final Sacrifice //

Lord Jesus
Oh Jesus
You're my only god
You're my only girl

I follow you now
I follow you down
To a dirty black room
Where the air is gone
I'll lie down on the table
And I'll wait for you
To step inside me now
Come inside me now
Step inside me now
Come on
Come on in

Oh Jesus Christ
You're my only god
If I drink your blood
I will be like you
Girl I wanna be like you
I look into your eyes
And close my mind
Get out of my mind
Get out of my head

Oh Jesus
You're my only god

(Thank you very much.)
