Album: CountrySquire

// Country Squire //

Well tonight, I'm up in Chillicothe
Down-wind from the paper mill
I'm out here spittin' on the sidewalk
Taking in the factory smells
Head and nose, she tends to smokin' out the window
In the air, that gas pipe leak
I wonder if she's cringing at the same time
Thinking pretty thoughts of me

I was up for hours this morning
Pulling traps before I said goodbye
I plan to tan myself a fox hide
And hang it on my darling bride
'Cause they tell me that it's gonna be a big one
And the snow is settin' in
And I don't want her cold while I ain't at home
The way that I have been

Spending my nights in a bar room, Lord
Turnin' them songs into two-by-fours
Dreaming 'bout the day that I'm sitting by the fire
Huddled with my honey in the Country Squire

Well tomorrow, we hit the country music highway
On our way to Circleville
We're off to do some weekend warring
While we sing and drink our fill
And when I ain't out playing on my six-string
With the nickels I acquire
I'm trying to fix her up a castle
It's called the Country Squire

It's a twenty-four-foot-long vessel
Measures eight feet wide
It's a fifty-three-year-old camper
It's made to pull behind
And I've gutted to the studs and the rafters
And I'm building back piece by piece
I'm trying to fix her up a temple
My Lady of the Estill Springs

Spending my nights in a bar room, Lord
Turnin' them songs into two-by-fours
Dreaming 'bout the day that I'll sit by the fire
Huddled with my honey in our Country Squire

One day, I aim to have myself a family
And a cabin on the hill
And I might have to come off of the highway
To help with the family bills
But when the kids have got a little older
On the day that I retire
I'll take her somewhere warm for the winter
Pulling our Country Squire

Spending my nights in a bar room, Lord
Turnin' them songs into two-by-fours
Dreaming 'bout the day that I'll sit by the fire
Huddled with my honey in our Country Squire
Dreaming 'bout the day that I'll sit by the fire
Huddled with my honey in our Country Squire

// Bus Route //

This is where we dropped off the prettiest little girl
Same grade as me
Tried to kiss her once in the aisle of the bus
And she walked right over me
Face-down in the gum on the floor
I was hopin' that she'd change her mind
But I swear as she walked down the stairs
She didn't even wave goodbye
Didn't even wave goodbye

Ray Dixon didn't take no lip
He'd kick you right off the bus
Stop by your house on the way out of the holler
And tell your momma where you was
He didn't need no driver's aid
To keep a bunch of kids in line
All he needed was a glare in the mirror
And a paddle that he carved from pine
Blisterin' punk kids alive

This is where we dropped off the prettiest little girl
Same grade as me
I held onto hope for eight long years
And by the time that I turned sixteen
I wasn't awkward, I's a real smooth talker
With my very own pickup truck
I'd take her home and if her parents weren't around
She'd bring me in and give me some
Bring me in and give me some

Safe to say nowadays ol' Ray
Can't keep a route very long
And I'm glad the little girl's dad
Never found out what was goin' on
I know he'd kill me in a minute
And he wouldn't have left no trace
Hogs'll eat 'bout anything you give 'em
And they don't let nothin' go to waste
Don't let nothin' go to waste

This is where we dropped off the prettiest little girl
Same grade as me

// Creeker //

In a small corner bar he sits there a-drinkin'
Lost as a ball in a field full of corn
Further away than he ever imagined
That he'd ever end up from the place he was born

Now no more forlorn as the Creeker drank whiskey
Than the one that you see outside of your eye
Drinkin' alone as he looks out the window
At all of the strangers on the corner outside

He'd rather be dead
Than alive one more minute
In this godforsaken town
When he was a kid
Lord, he'd never have dreamed it
All the ways that the city can bring a country boy down

Now they knew not his name and he knew not their faces
And he knew not the how nor the reason for why
You could ever wake up and wanna keep on a-livin'
In a place where a friend is such a hard thing to find

And for everyone you meet there's a whole mess of people
Tryin' like hell to pull you on down
To the level they're on and the trouble they're tendin'
In the mess that they've made, in the gutter they found

He'd rather be dead
Than alive one more minute
In this godforsaken town
When he was a kid
Lord, he'd never have dreamed it
All the ways that the city can bring a country boy down

Some fellas do drugs and things of that nature
Some fellas chase girls to hang on their arm
Some fellas get by on practically nothin'
Some fellas get pissed in a small corner bar

And they'd rather be dead
Than alive one more minute
In this godforsaken town
When they were all kids
Lord, they'd never have dreamed it
All the ways that the city can bring a country boy down

// Gemini //

If He knows how it feels to be beginnin' and the end
I reckon He knows the feelin' 'tween the now and then
I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place friend
Lord, won't you help me carry my load?

I borrowed me a hammer, I swung it for a dime
I got to where I finally could afford me mine
But in between the swingin' and the idle time
I got to thinkin' heavy on the road

Now I'm hid out in the upper room
With walls so thin I could bust right through
Give all my buddies a ramblin' to
About the shit that really blows my mind

Back when I was younger, I didn't have a clue
Come to think of it I still doubt I do
But every now and then I get to thinkin'
"You know, I've got it all worked out."

I used to take my time and burn it in a bong
Iced down with the lights turned off
And somethin' in the speakers I could ponder on
Somethin' I could mull around

Now I'm lit up like a Christmas tree
Check one-two can y'all hear me?
The sights are somethin' but they ain't for free
Lookin' at 'em wired for sound

The road goes on forever, the party it will tend
To run forever if ya never let it end
I got a part of me that's wonderin' when
I'll finally kick the urge to roam

Part of me just wants to live forever on the road
Split me down the middle, ship my southpaw home
If she gets to askin' tell her you don't rightly know
What happened to the rest of me

Aw, weep no more, girl don't cry
Hellfire ya married you a Gemini
This is the half of him you always liked
Looky here his heart still beats

// House Fire //

You could set my house on fire, baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
'Cause this house is mighty cold and I feel like
Melting all the snow away

You see these boots I'm wearing?
They're tough enough to go
And they will take many roads to reach you
Honey, won't you light the way?

You could set my house on fire, baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
'Cause this house is mighty cold and I feel like
Melting all the snow away

You see this train I'm riding?
It's burning up the coal
And its wheels are bound to roll right by you
Honey, won't you jump my train?

You could set my house on fire, baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
'Cause this house is mighty cold and I feel like
Melting all the snow away

You could set my house on fire, baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
'Cause this house is mighty cold and I feel like
Melting all the snow away

You could set my house on fire, baby

// Everlovin' Hand //

They got my favorite lotion here
Something in a hotel I admire
I got the pictures that you sent me
How they fill me with desire

Tonight we've all got our own rooms
I'm about to burn mine down
Because I miss you somethin' fierce
In this quaint New England town

I read the texts you whispered plain
Everything you aim to do
Sure do like the way you think
That's the way I'm thinking too

I see it play out in my mind
You and I unite as one
The van don't leave 'til 10 A.M
And we've only just begun

This one here goes out to you
Lord wherever you may be
When you're reaching for a fruit
I pray you'll fondly think of me
It gets so hard out on the road
But I'm going alone because I'm your man
I have got you on my mind
And my ever loving hand

For a moment you were here
Moment passed and you were gone
Didn't even clean the mess
That you clearly helped to cause

When the boys asked how I slept
I'll just look 'em in the eye
Tell them all you'd come to visit
I didn't get a wink of sleep last night

This one here goes out to you
Lord wherever you may be
When you're reaching for a fruit
I pray you'll fondly think of me
It gets so hard out on the road
But I'm going alone because I'm your man
I have got you on my mind
And my ever loving hand

It gets so hard out on the road
But I'm going alone because I'm your man
I have got you on my mind
And my ever loving hand

// Peace Of Mind //

He drinks orange juice and vodka
In the basement while she's talking
To someone long distance for hours and hours on end
And as he's slowly sippin'
He thinks about his children
And the heart attacks that youngest daughter's always giving him

He ain't smoked no marijuana
Since he got on with the railroad
And he's been on with the railroad for a long and lonesome while
But the day that he retires
He will smoke himself to China
He will leave behind his worries as he's racing through the sky

She sells Avon to her buddies
And saves a little money
For all the makeup she's been using to hide away the years
And she sits and watches TV
Usually every evening
If there ain't some kind of ball game her daughter has to cheer

She sneaks menthols every morning
While her family's still snoring
As she burns the Eggos she looks back at her life
That heart she broke in highschool
He's singing on the Opry
She wonders what the hell that she was thinking at the time

Oh the days are dark down in the holler
Waiting for the sun to shine
On the back you've been breaking
Trying to earn peace of mind

Their youngest daughter Stella
She's been running with this fella
That he cannot stand the thought of, that he surely does despise
He's told her he best never
See the two of them together
But it's hard to keep an eye on her when you're working all the time

There are things he needs to tend to
And the bills the bank keeps sendin'
Lord, the zeros on the end keep pushing further to the right
Like a freight train hauling sorrow
And moving ever onward
Through the tunnel of forever towards the never ending light

Oh the days are dark down in the holler
Waiting for the sun to shine
On the back you've been breaking
Trying to earn peace of mind
Trying to earn peace of mind

// All Your'n //

Drivin' through the roadwork
Oh the work they took forever on
The road cones blur like memories
Of the miles we shared between

The place you learned to say your prayers
The place I took to prayin'
Loadin in and breakin down
My road dog door deal dreams

Long before we ever met
I made up my direction
Long before I knew the half
Of half that I'm sure of now

Though I'd say it ain't the way that you'd a gone about it
Follow me and lead me on and never let me down

So I'll love ya till my lungs give out
I ain't lyin'
I'm all yourn and you're all mine

There ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' bout it
I'm all yourn and you're all mine

Fried morels and fine hotels and all that in the middle
Every bite and curtain drawn I wanna taste with you

The goddess in my Days Inn pen
The muse I aint' refusin'
The part of me that ain't around
I'm always talkin' to

So I'll love ya till my lungs give out
I ain't lyin'
I'm all yourn and you're all mine
There ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' bout it
I'm all yourn and you're all mine

So I'll love ya till my lungs give out
I ain't lyin'
I'm all yourn and you're all mine
There ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' bout it
I'm all yourn and you're all mine

No there ain't two ways around it
There ain't no tryin' about it
I'm all yourn and you're all mine

// Matthew //

He works the night shift at the depot
With a pistol and a light
And he guards them rusty missiles
Counting whitetail to pass the time
And he's worked there for a long while
Since he came home from overseas
Helping Kilcoran fight the good fight
And bring Baghdad to its knees
And it was hotter than the mountain
But it weren't so he couldn't stand
And it weren't so much the heat wave
Nearly as much as all the sand

Now his daddy, he was a log man
With a good leg and a fake
That he got off of a buddy
And a shitshot that he made
And he worked them hands to splinters
And he raised them young'uns right
On a little bit of scripture
And an acreage of paradise
And he'd go out on weekends
And he played like Clarence White
If Clarence had a real job
And picked the guitar when there was time

Keeps a trap line in the winter
Keeps a line wet in the spring
On a lock wall, fishing muskie
With his eldest and Steve
And they swap tales about their raisin'
And they tell the awfullest lies
And they go home when they've a notion
And the muskie quit to bitin'
