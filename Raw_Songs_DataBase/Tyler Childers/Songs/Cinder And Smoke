You can set my house on fire baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
Cause this house is mighty cold
And I feel like meltin' all the snow away

Well you see these boots I'm wearin'
They're tough enough to go
And they'll take any road to reach you
Honey won't you light the way

You can set my house on fire baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
Cause this house is mighty cold
And I feel like meltin' all the snow away

You see this train I'm ridin'
It's burnin' up the coal
And its wheels are bound to roll right by you
Honey won't you jump my train

You can set my house on fire baby
You can turn it into cinder and smoke
Cause this house is mighty cold
And I feel like meltin' all the snow away
