In a small corner bar he sits there a-drinkin'
Lost as a ball in a field full of corn
Further away than he ever imagined
That he'd ever end up from the place he was born

Now no more forlorn as the Creeker drank whiskey
Than the one that you see outside of your eye
Drinkin' alone as he looks out the window
At all of the strangers on the corner outside

He'd rather be dead
Than alive one more minute
In this godforsaken town
When he was a kid
Lord, he'd never have dreamed it
All the ways that the city can bring a country boy down

Now they knew not his name and he knew not their faces
And he knew not the how nor the reason for why
You could ever wake up and wanna keep on a-livin'
In a place where a friend is such a hard thing to find

And for everyone you meet there's a whole mess of people
Tryin' like hell to pull you on down
To the level they're on and the trouble they're tendin'
In the mess that they've made, in the gutter they found

He'd rather be dead
Than alive one more minute
In this godforsaken town
When he was a kid
Lord, he'd never have dreamed it
All the ways that the city can bring a country boy down

Some fellas do drugs and things of that nature
Some fellas chase girls to hang on their arm
Some fellas get by on practically nothin'
Some fellas get pissed in a small corner bar

And they'd rather be dead
Than alive one more minute
In this godforsaken town
When they were all kids
Lord, they'd never have dreamed it
All the ways that the city can bring a country boy down
