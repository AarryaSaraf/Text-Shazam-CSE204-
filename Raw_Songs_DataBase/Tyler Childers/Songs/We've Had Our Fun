I need some money
I need it now
Give me a trunk load
And I'll show you how
We'll take that shinin' in no time
We'll be rollin' in the dough

But you don't take nothin'
Without gettin' bruised
See there's always somethin'
Your bound to lose
And it's usually gone
Before you know
When the man comes down
He won't cut us any slack
We've had our fun
On our own

You see all them blue lights?
They ain't your friends
They're bound to get you
But in the end
I'll show you all the tricky curves
And want you need to swerve around

But you don't take nothin'
Without gettin' bruised
See there's always somethin'
Your bound to lose
And it's usually gone
Before you know
When the man comes down
He won't cut us any slack
We've had our fun
On our own

When the man comes down
He won't cut us any slack
We've had our fun
On our own
