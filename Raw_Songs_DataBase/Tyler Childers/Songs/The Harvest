When the triggers moving backwards and the pin hits the shell
When my soul sinks slowly into the warm pits of hell
Won't you tell my baby sister that I'll be back in the fall
Cause it's better to have false hope than no hope at all

And I'll be meeting with my savior to go over my foolish deeds
When he asks me why I did it lord I'll blame it on the seed
Cause it didn't grow in like I planned and when it did it all went dry
And I couldn't stand to hear the pain of a small baby crying

Well I remember in the graveyards well I used to read the names
And I wondered when the good lord would take my soul away
Well I wonder if he planned it to happen like this at all
With the shot heard halfway cross the world and my sins on the wall

And I'll be meeting with my savior to go over my foolish deeds
When he asks me why I did it lord I'll blame it on the seed
Cause it didn't grow in like I planned and when it did it all went dry
And I couldn't stand to hear the pain of a small baby crying

And they'll tell me I'm a bad man but they never seen the sight
Of a baby wailing in it's crib and ripping apart the night
Is a small baby crying
