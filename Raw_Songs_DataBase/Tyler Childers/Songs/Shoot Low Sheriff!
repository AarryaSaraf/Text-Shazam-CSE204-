Well, you'd better shoot low, Sheriff, they might be crawlin'
Got a big load of booze that they'll soon be a-haulin'
They're runnin' every night when the whippoorwill is callin'
So shoot low, Sheriff, 'cause they might be crawlin'

Old Uncle Bill's got a still on a hill
He never worked a day and I guess he never will
He runs shine liquor and he sells it to Paw
It made Maw mad and she called the law

Well, you'd better shoot low, Sheriff, they might be crawlin'
Got a big load of booze that they'll soon be a-haulin'
They're runnin' every night when the whippoorwill is callin'
So shoot low, Sheriff, 'cause they might be crawlin'

Maw put the sheriff on Uncle Bill's trail
Said, "Catch that sot and throw him in jail"
Run out on his wife with the little kids squallin'
So shoot low, Sheriff, 'cause they might be crawlin'

Yeah, you'd better shoot low, sheriff, they might be crawlin'
Got a big load of booze that they'll soon be a-haulin'
They're runnin' every night when the whippoorwill is callin'
So shoot low, Sheriff, 'cause they might be crawlin'

Uncle Bill held the bottle 'tween his finger and thumb
Said if I leave any, you can have some
Make him reach in his pocket for his last thin dime
And wear summer britches in the cold wintertime

Yeah, you'd better shoot low, Sheriff, they might be crawlin'
Got a big load of booze that they'll soon be a-haulin'
They're runnin' every night when the whippoorwill is callin'
So shoot low, Sheriff, 'cause they might be crawlin'
Yeah, you'd better shoot low, Sheriff, they might be crawlin'
Got a big load of booze that they'll soon be a-haulin'
They're runnin' every night when the whippoorwill is callin'
So shoot low, Sheriff, 'cause they might be crawlin'

Shoot low, Sheriff, 'cause they might be crawlin'
