Oh Rosie, Rosie my girl
When our embrace is over
All that's left is the world
It's a mighty cold town
To be wanderin' around
Without Rosie my girl

The floor is about to give way
To the weight of the words
You've been dyin' to say
We could save this house
If you'd just say 'em now
Oh Rosie my girl

Well silence is a mighty big grave
And whatever goes down there
Is as cold as the clay
Won't you keep me warm?
Tell me what I've done wrong
Oh Rosie my girl
