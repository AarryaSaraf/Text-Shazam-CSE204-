Don't you wish that you could go back sometimes
Don't you wish that you could go back home
Tryin' to remember just where it was
Remember you ain't alone
Remember you ain't alone

Every day's another pointless job
And every night's another lonesome song
Tryin' to remember when your bed wasn't leather
And you were the one singin' along
Lord, where did we go wrong

Now the sky is coming down
Can't you see the stars fallin'
Have yourself another round
Til you can't hear the darkness callin'
Til you can't hear the darkness call you

There was a good man in the makin' once
In the light of yesterday
Tryin' to remember just who he was
Tryin' like hell to recall his name
Well it used to be my name

Now the sky is coming down
Can't you see the stars fallin'
Have yourself another round
Til you can't hear the darkness callin'
Til you can't hear the darkness call you
