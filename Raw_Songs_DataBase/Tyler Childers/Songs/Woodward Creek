I've ran around
And I've seen a thing or two
Leave that highway black and blue
With the will beneath my feet

And I can tell ya now
Them girls and the whole delight
The way you look tonight, smilin' back at me

Walk across the bridge and rest your head upon my shoulder
Tell me I'm the one to hold ya till the world runs out of steam
Sing to me a song you wrote
Tear me all to pieces girl
Kiss me like you mean it once before you fall asleep

I got kin
Up north where the wind blows cold
We'll leave tomorrow
Stay drunk for a few good days
When we've spent every dime I've worked to save
We can pack it up
Come back to woodward creek

Walk across the bridge and rest your head upon my shoulder
Tell me I'm the one to hold ya till the world runs out of steam
Sing to me a song you wrote
Tear me all to pieces girl
Kiss me like you mean it once before you fall asleep

I've got plans
That'll take me far from Irvine
But if I could, Lord knows I'd love to stay
We've got time 'fore I leave these mountains
One more night on the banks of woodward creek

Walk across the bridge and rest your head upon my shoulder
Tell me I'm the one to hold ya till the world runs out of steam
Sing to me a song you wrote
Tear me all to pieces girl
Kiss me like you mean it once before you fall asleep
