Church bells ring at your window and I know that all of these things
Are surely found to be holy in the presence of the Lord
Tell me all that your feeling and I will believe every word
'Cause to think you would speak out in lies
Baby that just sounds absurd
And if you want me to go I will
But if you need me to stay baby that'd be a thrill

'Cause tomorrow will be a long, hard road out of Ohio and I'll hate every mile
That takes me back to Kentucky and away from your smile

Hold me and tell me you need me
I need you more than you know
'Cause now that I've found what I wanted it's hard to let it go
And the hills have always been home
But now that I've found you the shadows seem cold

And tomorrow will be a long, hard road out of Ohio and I'll hate every mile
That takes me back to Kentucky and away from your smile

And if you want me to go I will
But if you need me to stay baby that'd be a thrill
'Cause tomorrow will be a long, hard road out of Ohio and I'll hate every mile
That takes me back to Kentucky and away from your smile
