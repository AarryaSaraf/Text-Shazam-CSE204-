Well she don't like it when I ain't sober
And I can't say that I blame her
I don't see how she takes it, boys
I don't how she takes it

And she done told me that it's all over
If I walk through the front door
Three sheets to the wind again
Three sheets to the wind

And I just laughed it off
How you gonna get back home?
If you ain't got a dime
And it don't come from me
And that's a long way to walk
And you ain't the ramblin' kind
So I just think it's best
If you decide to stay

Well those mountain women gonna get their way
Or they'll sure die of tryin'
I don't know why she tries so hard
I don't know why she tries
Cause us mountain fellas are awful stubborn
And we don't give a god damn
We don't give a damn
No we just don't care

And we can't get enough of all these neon nights
Barroom brawls and bedroom quarrels
And we come home too late
And it ain't nothin' new
And it's just the same ol' thing
And I work way too hard
To take this shit off Jane

Well she went down to the Western Union
Called her country cousin
I need to get back home right now
I need to get away
Cause it ain't funny when he ain't sober honey
Get me on a Greyhound
Get me on a Greyhound home
Get me to the hills

And I went out one night
Came home when the rooster crowed
And there weren't nothin' left but the smell of her perfume
Ain't never felt so small, ain't felt so much pain
And I'm just way too drunk
To take this shit off Jane
