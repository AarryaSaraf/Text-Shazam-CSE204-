There's a place dear to me
Where I'm longing to be
With my friends at the Old Country Church
There with mother we went
And our Sundays were spent
With my friends at the Old Country Church

Precious years of memories
Oh, what joy they bring to me
How I long once more to be
With my friends at the Old Country Church

As a small country boy
How my heart beat with joy
When I knelt in the Old Country Church
And the Savior above
By His wonderful love
Saved my soul in the Old Country Church

Precious years of memories
Oh, what joy they bring to me 
How I long once more to be
With my friends at the Old Country Church

How I wish that today
All the people would pray 
As they prayed in the Old Country Church
If they'd only confess
Jesus surely would bless
As He did in the Old Country Church

Precious years of memories
Oh, what joy they bring to me
How I long once more to be
With my friends at the Old Country Church

Precious years of memories
Oh, what joy they bring to me
How I long once more to be
With my friends at the Old Country Church
With my friends at the Old Country Church
