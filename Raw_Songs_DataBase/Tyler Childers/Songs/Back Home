I was meltin'
Through the box springs
I was drippin' on the floor
Watchin' the dark dance surplus
On another hotel door

Don't let me die
Alone in this room
Thinkin' about
The time I've got
Off the road back home with you

I was hurlin'

I was swingin' ceiling fans
Cause and effect and towards
A cold and lonley man

Don't let me die
Alone in this room
Thinkin' about
The time I've got
Off the road back home with you

Don't let me die
Alone in this room
Thinkin' about
The time I've got
Off the road back home with you

Now I'm reachin' for the bottle
While I'm pouring over my phone
I'm throwing down the other
As I drain one to the bone

Don't let me die
Alone in this room
Thinkin' about
The time I've got
Off the road back home with you
