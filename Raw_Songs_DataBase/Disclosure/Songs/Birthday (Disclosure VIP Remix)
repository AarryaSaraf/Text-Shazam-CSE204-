Oh, babe, oh babe
You've been on my mind
Just an old flame, old flame
I left you behind
But, oh, if it were any other day
Maybe you'd want me to stay away
I'm just wondering what you would say
Would it be a big mistake?

Can I call you on your birthday
Just to make sure that you're okay?
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost
And let you go your own way?

Can I call you on your birthday
Just to make sure that you're okay?
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working?

Yeah

I ain't even calling for no reconciliation
I just want to tap in and see how you've been
I've waited for an adequate amount of time to give us both some space
I think it's been good for us to stay up out the way, but it
Can't hurt to check up on an ex
Not to flex but to put the hurt to rest
Put maturity to test
So I'm calling to say
Are you okay on your special day?

Can I call you on your birthday (Your birthday)
Just to make sure that you're okay? (Okay)
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost
And let you go your own way?

Can I call you on your birthday (Can I call you?)
Just to make sure that you're okay? (You're okay)
Got the number to your old phone (Oh yeah)
But is it working? (Working, working, oh)

If I called you on your birthday, yeah
Would it be worth it?

Should I call you on your birthday?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Till you deserve it

Can I call you on your birthday
Just to make sure that you're okay? (You're okay)
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost (Go ghost)
And let you go your own way?

Can I call you on your birthday
Just to make sure that you're okay? (Make sure that you're okay)
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working?

But is it working?
