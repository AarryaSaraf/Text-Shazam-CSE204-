I've been workin' and I spent my time
Dreamin' about how I could ease my mind
Breakin' dance, feels like I can fly
Give me some space so I can close my eyes

I don't look in the crowd
Baby, even when the lights go down
I like to dance like I'm alone in the room
I'm here tonight, baby, to do what I do, yeah

You make me watch your step when you move
You make me watch your step when you move
You make me watch your step when you move
Now what you're doing's making me move with you

I'm free tonight, don't want this to end
I'm here alone and you can leave your friends
Breakin' dance and we don't pretend
Chain linked together, now our rhythms bend

I don't look in the crowd
Baby, even when the lights go down
I like to dance like I'm alone in the room
I'm here tonight, baby, to do what I do, yeah

You make me watch your step when you move (Watch your step when you move)
You make me watch your step when you move (Watch your step when you move)
You make me watch your step when you move (Watch your step when you move)
Now what you're doing's making me move with you

You make me watch your step when you move
You make me watch your step when you move
You make me watch your step when you move (Watch your step when you move)
Now what you're doing's making me move with you

(With you, with you)
(With you, with you)
(With you, with you)

(Watch your step when you move)
Now what you're doing's making me move with you

I don't look in the crowd
Baby, even when the lights come down
I like to dance like I'm alone in the room
I'm here tonight, baby, to do what I do, yeah

You make me watch your step when you move (Watch your step when you move)
You make me watch your step when you move (Watch your step when you move)
You make me watch your step when you move (Watch your step when you move)
Now what you're doing's making me move with you

(With you, with you)
(With you, with you)
(With you, with you)
(With you, with you)
