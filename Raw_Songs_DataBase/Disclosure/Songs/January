Tell me just what I should be expecting
Cause here I am on my own free will
Fortune favors the brave,
So they say

I might as well fix up and play your game
Make the memory the reason
Remembering the time when you and I: we fell behind
But found a way to justify

And we cannot replay
Give the aesthetical feel
We had our brighter day
Was it synthetic or real?

I'll protect the memory
If, baby, you can't recall it
You can't recall that
22nd January
baby you can't recall it
I won't forget that

I'll protect the memory
If, baby, you can't recall it
You can't recall that
22nd January
baby you can't recall it
I won't forget that

Was it just as real as you expected?
Does looking back give you a chill?
Show me something you prefer today
Yeah yeah

Or maybe you're grown up and I'm the same
That amnesia gave you freedom
Or maybe you're the kind that tells a lie just to lie
I never have to say goodbye

And we cannot replay
Give the aesthetical feel
We had our brighter day
Was it synthetic or real?

Putting faith in your relief
I'll suspend your disbelief
Putting faith in your relief
I'll suspend your disbelief

Putting faith in your relief
I'll suspend your disbelief
Putting faith in your relief
I'll suspend your disbelief

I'll protect the memory
If, baby, you can't recall it
You can't recall that
22nd January
If, baby, you can't recall it
I won't forget that

I'll protect the memory
If, baby, you can't recall it
You can't recall that
22nd January
If, baby, you can't recall it
I won't forget that

I'll protect the memory
If, baby, you can't recall it
You can't recall that
22nd January
If, baby, you can't recall it
I won't forget that
