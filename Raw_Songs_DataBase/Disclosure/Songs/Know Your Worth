He keeps leaving you for dead
I don't know what you've been waiting for
So you've got your love locked up instead
But something better's waiting at your door

You don't know your worth
All the things I know that you deserve
Say it's not real if it doesn't hurt
Find someone you know will put you first
Find someone who'll love you at your worst
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Who puts you first?
Find someone who loves you at your worst

Don't forget the words I said
Picking you up when you feeling down
You keep strung on thoughts left in your head
When you lose hope, soon you will be found

You don't know your worth
All the things I know that you deserve
Say it's not real if it doesn't hurt
Find someone you know will put you first
Find someone who'll love you at your worst
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Who puts you first?
Find someone who loves you at your worst

(Find someone who loves you at your worst)

Find someone who'll love you at your worst
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Who puts you first?
Find someone who loves you at your worst

(Find someone who loves you at your worst)
Find someone who loves you at your worst
