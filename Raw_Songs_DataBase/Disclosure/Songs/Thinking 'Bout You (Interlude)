(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)
(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)

(Where do I go) When you're away?
(What do I do?) Think of you
(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)

(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)
(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)

Thinkin' of you (Thinkin')
Here by my side
Wanting just to touch your face and hands
(Thinkin' 'bout you, ba-)

(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)
(Thinkin' 'bout you, baby)
