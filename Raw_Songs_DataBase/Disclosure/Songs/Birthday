Oh babe, oh babe
You've been on my mind
Just an old flame, old flame
I left you behind
But, oh, if it were any other day
Maybe you'd want me to stay away
I'm just wonderin' what you would say
Or would it be a big mistake?

Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost?
And let you go your own way
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working?

Yeah
I ain't even callin' for no reconciliation
I just want to tap in and see how you been
I've waited for an adequate amount of time
To give us both some space
I think it's been good for us to stay up out of the way
But it can't hurt to check up on an ex, not to flex
But to put the hurt to rest, put maturity to the test
So I'm callin' to say "Are you okay?" on your special day

Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost?
And let you go your own way
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working?

If I called you on your birthday?
Would it be worth it?
Should I call you on your birthday?

Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost?
And let you go your own way
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working?

But is it working?
