Who knew? What you'd do to me
I can't fake it
I can't break this spell I won't let go
Who knew?

Was out there by my own
You help me get to know me
You know me well I owe you
I know I won't hold back
I know I can't hold back, babe
Who knew what you do?
I just can't time waist
I'm in my bag way back when nigga didn't no have sense
You was a Faberge egg then much to delicate
I could not fathom breaking bread then
Now I'm breaking bad habits
Had to face the backtracking
Had to face it and ask
Who knew?
Who knew?

I could grow, like the trees
I could show you, I could change
(If you wanna go, won't make a stand
I already showed my hand)
If you don't, we could roll
Light the smoke, let it in
(And we'll be gone off that in 10
That's when the vibe start setting in)
