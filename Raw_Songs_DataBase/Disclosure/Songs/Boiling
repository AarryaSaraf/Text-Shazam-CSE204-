Somethin' is boilin', boilin' in me
Someone is toyin', toyin' with me
It won't get out, it won't stop
It don't move out, it won't leave
It won't get out, it won't stop
It don't move out

I need it now, eyy
I need it now, eyy

I need it now, eyy
I need it now, eyy

Someone's ignorin', ignorin' defeat,
But the taste of your poison,
your poison is sweet, so sweet

He won't give up, and I won't up and go
I don't know how
He won't give up, and I won't up and go
He's had enough, I won't leave

He won't give up, but I won't up and go
I don't know how
He won't give up, but I won't up and go
He's had enough

I need it now, oooh ohhh
I need it now, ohh whoa-oh
I need it now, ohh whoa-oh
I need it now, eyyy

Took my heart and kept it
Now my wounds are setting
There's no choice I could do
I've become so reckless
All my love's affected
With the remnants of you
You

I need it now, eyyy

Ohh
