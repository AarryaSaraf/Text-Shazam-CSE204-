Album: Caracal

// Nocturnal //

Street lights, turn on one by one
My hope is, descending like the sun
Try to tell myself there's freedom in the loneliness (Oh baby)
Always restless, story of my life
Disconnected, body clock's not right
Try to tell myself that I'mma get some sleep tonight

Found myself where I started, this isn't where I want to be
The time that I find hardest, always comes eventually

My shadow doesn't show in the dark
The night time is inclined to my heart
The emptiness I felt from the start
Will follow me 'till I fall apart

Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal

My demons are blocking out the light
And my mind is about to lose the fight
Why can't I find peace, when a caracal could sleep tonight? (Yeah)
Your absence isn't something that I choose (choose, choose choose)
The truth is you were never mine to lose (lose, lose, lose)
Said that I feel lifeless, tryna get away from you (Oh baby, oh)

Found myself where I started, this isn't where I want to be
The time that I find hardest, always comes eventually

My shadow doesn't show in the dark
The night time is inclined to my heart
The emptiness I felt from the start
Will follow me 'till I fall apart

Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal (Oh yeah)

My shadow doesn't show in the dark
The night time is inclined to my heart
The emptiness I felt from the start
Will follow me 'till I fall apart

Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal

// Omen //

I'm feeling something, something different
When you left, my picture changed
I was blinded, I'd not envisioned
The same face in a different frame

It's an omen
Caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me
Without you I am lonely

My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen

Omen, omen

You were waiting, I was vacant
You left before my eyes
Then it hit me, you're relocating
And I need you by my side

It's an omen
Caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me
Without you I am lonely

My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen

My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen

Omen
Now love
Omen
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark

Omen
But now I see your tears as an omen
Omen
Now I see your tears as an omen
Omen

// Holding On //

Weight of love on my shoulders
I thought that it would be easier than this
I found my heart had grown colder
But the warmth of your kiss, I can't dismiss

Though my past has left me bruised
I ain't hiding from the truth
When the truth won't let me lie right next to you

[Chorus:]
But it's holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to make it
Played the part, but I can't fake it
It keeps holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to break it
Heaven knows that I can't shake it
But it's holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to make it
Played the part, but I can't fake it
It keeps holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to break it
Heaven knows that I can't shake it

Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on

I've seen times that were harder
I remember the taste of bitterness
Won't you help me, my father?
Help me fall in the love that I have missed

Though my past has left me bruised
I ain't hiding from the truth
When the truth won't let me lie right next to you

[Chorus:]
But it's holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to make it
Played the part, but I can't fake it
It keeps holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to break it
Heaven knows that I can't shake it
But it's holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to make it
Played the part, but I can't fake it
It keeps holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to break it
Heaven knows that I can't shake it

Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on
It keeps holding on and on

// Hourglass //

There's someone out there waiting for me
High, mini, fat, skinny, just wait and see
Don't call me lonely if you are too
In a big city, take pity, won't make the news
I'm advancing, nothing to lose
Go-getter, do better, the right attitude
Do as I say, not as I do
Got no money, nobody, to tell you the truth

When I wake up in the morning
I don't really want for much
See the sunlight as a warning
Cause you're too far away to touch

Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Hands up, there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine, love, cause I don't wanna live without it
Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Hands up, there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine, love, cause I don't wanna live without it

So come on, surprise me, I don't care who
Your step missing, time's ticking, ain't got a clue
Something I said, the way that I move
Strong passion, high fashion, too much for you
Don't complicate this, simple to me
I got it, you want it, but it might not be free
The sun falls slowly, shadows of love
Get together, now or never, can't wait till dawn

When I wake up in the morning
I don't really want for much
See the sunlight as a warning
Cause you're too far away to touch

Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Hands up, there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine, love, cause I don't wanna live without it
Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Hands up, there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine, love, cause I don't wanna live without it

// Willing & Able //

Don't say you want me, don't say you need me
If you ain't ready, turn around
Willing and able, cards on the table
And I believe in what we've found

If we can't trust the love in us
There'll be no looking back, no looking back, no
If there's enough, in stuff we touch
There'll be no looking back, no looking back, no

If we're falling in love, we're falling in love
There'll be nothing above
And I won't give you up, no I won't give you up
If we're falling in love
If we're falling in love, we're falling in love
There'll be nothing above
And I won't give you up, no I won't give you up
If we're falling in love

If you don't feel it, the same as me
Speak now or hold your peace
If you don't see it, the way I see
Then it was never meant to be

If we can't trust the love in us
There'll be no looking back, no looking back, no
If there's enough, in stuff we touch
There'll be no looking back, no looking back, no

If we're falling in love, we're falling in love
There'll be nothing above
And I won't give you up, no I won't give you up
If we're falling in love
If we're falling in love, we're falling in love
There'll be nothing above
And I won't give you up, no I won't give you up
If we're falling in love
If we're falling in love

If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in

// Magnets //

Never really felt bad about it
As we drank deep from a lie
'Cause I felt melting magnets, babe
The second I saw you through half-shut eyes

Smoke and sunset, off Mulholland
He was talking, I was wondering 'bout
You and that girl, she your girlfriend?
Face from heaven, bet the world she don't know

Pretty girls don't know the things that I know
Walk my way, I'll share the things that she won't

Uh-oh, dancin' past the point of no return
Let go, we can free ourselves of all we've learned
I love this secret language that we're speaking
Say it to me, let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return

Never really thought we would make it
We be thinking about what could have been
But we've had a record summer, can't turn it down, oh
Now I don't wanna see the end begin

Smoke and sunset, off Mulholland
He was talking, I was wondering 'bout
You and that girl, she your girlfriend?
Face from heaven, bet the world she don't know

Pretty girls don't know the things that I know
Walk my way, I'll share the things that she won't

Uh-oh, dancin' past the point of no return
Let go, we can free ourselves of all we've learned
I love this secret language that we're speaking
Say it to me, let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return

(Let's embrace the point of no return)
(Let's embrace the point of no return)

// Jaded //

Your words give you away
Be careful how you say my name
Step back, refrain
Be honest and you'll save some face
Cause you're fading
Don't mistake me for a fool
The game you play has changed

Take a look at yourself and the stories you tell
Does the truth weigh on your mind?
Tell me what did it cost when the moment was lost
Is this how you survive?

Why, oh why do you have to lie?
What are you afraid of?
We know what you're made of
Now your time has passed you by
You've already made it
There's no need to chase it
Soak it up, soak it up and save it
Cause enough is enough, you're jaded
Golden years left you behind
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
You cannot replace them

The gospel that you preach
It's poisonous beyond belief
But still, you'll reach
Be careful or the truth might speak
It's amazing when it's there in black and white for all to see
We sow and you reap

Take a look at yourself and the stories you tell
Does the truth weigh on your mind?
Tell me what did it cost when the moment was lost
Is this how you survive?

Why, oh why do you have to lie?
What are you afraid of?
We know what you're made of
Now your time has passed you by
You've already made it
There's no need to chase it
Soak it up, soak it up and save it
Cause enough is enough, you're jaded
Golden years left you behind
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll waste them

Soak it up, soak it up and save it
Cause enough is enough, you're jaded
Golden years left you behind
You cannot replace them
Face it or you'll raise them
You cannot replace them

// Good Intentions //

Baby, you can believe me when I say I tried my best
But there's no other way
You deserve the world, I couldn't give you less

But I'm not perfect the way you're perfect
And though it hurts, yeah, it hurts to say goodbye

I know I let you down
It wasn't that your love wasn't good enough
Couldn't stick around
It's only in myself that I didn't trust
I had good intentions
I had good intentions

And it's a shame
All the heartache that I went and put you through
I take the blame
Cause the truth, there's really nothing you could do

But I'm not perfect the way you're perfect
And though it hurts, yeah, it hurts to say goodbye

I know I let you down
It wasn't that your love wasn't good enough
Couldn't stick around
It's only in myself that I didn't trust
I had good intentions
I had good intentions
I had good intentions
I...

But I'm not perfect the way you're perfect
And though it hurts, yeah, it hurts to say goodbye
But I'm not perfect the way you're perfect
And though it hurts, yeah, it hurts to say goodbye

// Superego //

It's not your bubble I'm bursting
But soon a penny's gonna drop
Every time we're conversing
I see your head about to pop

I'm looking at you, don't like what I see
You need to touch ground 'til you're level with me
So you better hold it, hold it down, down
This is bigger than you, it's bigger than me
You're stringing it out like a symphony
So you better hold it, hold it down, down, down

This ain't the me show, keep it on the low
Where's your superego?
You let your head grow, I tried to let you know
When I tell you how it is, you don't like it
You don't like it, you don't like it
I tell you how it is, you don't like it
You don't like it, you don't like it
I tell you how it is, you don't like it, no, no, no
So where's your superego?

You're my girl, so it's worth it
I'm gonna hit you with the truth
In this world no one's perfect
We're all consumed by what we do

I'm looking at you, don't like what I see
You need to touch ground and get level with me
So you better hold it, hold it down, down
This is bigger than you, it's bigger than me
You're stringing it out like a symphony
So you better hold it, hold it down, down, down, down

This ain't the me show, keep it on the low
Where's your superego?
You let your head grow, I tried to let you know
When I tell you how it is, you don't like it
You don't like it, you don't like it
I tell you how it is, you don't like it
You don't like it, you don't like it
I tell you how it is, you don't like it, no, no, no
So where's your superego?
So where's your superego?

You've lost a part of your mind
A part that's hard to define
I'm tryna help you with your superego
You've lost a part of your mind
A part that's hard to define
I'm tryna help you with your superego

This ain't the me show, keep it on the low
Where's your superego?
You let your head grow, I tried to let you know
When I tell you how it is, you don't like it
You don't like it, you don't like it
I tell you how it is, you don't like it
You don't like it, you don't like it
I tell you how it is, you don't like it, no, no, no
So where's your superego?
So where's your superego?

// Echoes //

You made a promise I won't forget
You were dishonest ever since we met
If I could count the times you told me with love in your voice
That you'd make an honest choice
You'd make an honest choice

Don't you remember anything that you said?
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
Don't you remember anything that you said?
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head

Such repetition, cause for concern
I shouldn't listen, but I never learn
If I could count the times you told me with love in your voice
That you'd make an honest choice
That you'd make an honest choice

Don't you remember anything that you said?
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
Don't you remember anything that you said?
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
Cause you're the echo that's in my head
Cause you're the echo that's in my head

I've had, I've had enough
Tryna find the space to interrupt
I've had, I've had enough
All the different ways you hold me up
I've had, I've had enough
Tryna find the space to interrupt
I've had, I've had enough
All the different ways you hold me up
Me up, me up, me up, me up
Me up, me up, me up, me up

Don't you remember anything that you said?
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
Don't you remember anything that you said?
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
Cause you're the echo that's in my head
Cause you're the echo that's in my head

// Masterpiece //

Lately, you hold your tongue and don't make a scene
But I see through the façade
See the queen behind the guard
Gently, you mask the fact that you disagree
Dealt a hand without your card
Had the joker from the start

You're yearning, wearing thin
Searching for something

I know what you're hiding but they can't see what you've got
What you've got, baby, what you've got, baby
Quit crying and stop trying to be someone you're not
What you're not baby, what you're not baby
Maybe you can't see
Oh, you're the masterpiece

In time, you'll see the colours through your own eyes
You could take the perfect shot
Show the people what you've got
A far cry from insecurity and demise
When your tears come to a stop
You can look down from the top

You're yearning, wearing thin
Searching for something

I know what you're hiding but they can't see what you've got
What you've got, baby, what you've got, baby
Quit crying and stop trying to be someone you're not
What you're not baby, what you're not baby
Maybe you can't see
Oh you're the masterpiece

What you got, baby
What you got, baby
What you got, baby
What you got, baby
What you got, baby
What you got, baby
What you got, baby
What you got, baby

// Molecules //

The lights are too bright
Let's turn them down and get to work
You're in the limelight
But I'll flip the switch if you prefer

You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright, I'll sit tight
Interconnected, so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight, it's not right

You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright, I'll sit tight
Interconnected, so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight, it's not right

I'm attracted by the way you move
And now you got me drowning by the things you knew
And nothing can stop me
I'm disregarding the rules
It goes down to molecules
I'm not looking for the words to say
What you've already heard a hundred times
Too late, I know that you got me
I'm disregarding the rules
It goes down to molecules

I know you want me
But I can act like I don't know
It's nearly morning
So grab your coat, it's time to go

You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright, I'll sit tight
Interconnected, so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight, it's not right

You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright, I'll sit tight
Interconnected, so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight, it's not right

I'm attracted by the way you move
And now you got me drowning by the things you knew
And nothing can stop me
I'm disregarding the rules
It goes down to molecules
I'm not looking for the words to say
What you've already heard a hundred times
Too late, I know that you got me
I'm disregarding the rules
It goes down to molecules

// Moving Mountains //

I can't stop
Whether you know or not
I ain't strong
And it's something in you that I'm depending on
Worth a shot
Even though I've lost the plot
I know it's wrong
But it's something in you that I'm depending on

Not going out tonight
Stay home until daylight
I'm hanging on for my life
I know myself all too well
Set myself up to fail
Is that what the future entails?

You give nothing to me
There wasn't nothing, that's not what I need
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I'm feelin' in love
With you here by my side
It seems like I can't do anything right
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I'm feelin' in love

Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains

Such a shame
Time for me to make a change
With what you've shown
Maybe you're just another stepping stone
Lost my name
Trying to put out this flame
I don't know
Maybe you're just another stepping stone

Not going out tonight
Stay home until daylight
I'm hanging on for my life
I know myself all too well
Set myself up to fail
Is that what the future entails?

You give nothing to me
There wasn't nothing, that's not what I need
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I'm feelin' in love
With you here by my side
It seems like I can't do anything right
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I'm feelin' in love

Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains

// Bang That //

Now let me see you bang it
I like it when you bang it
Now let me see you shake it
I wanna see you shake it
Now let me see you freak it
I love it when you freak it
Now let me see you work it
I wanna see you twerk it

Bang that till you pass out
Shake that till you pass out
Freak that till you pass out
Work that till you pass out

// Afterthought //

Anytime I'm alone, I'm reliving the moment
Does it enter your mind?
Have I already blown it?

Somehow in my head, it's overgrown
It's made me question everything I know
Did what you say contain an undertone?
It goes on and on and on

It keeps turning up, it won't leave me
Our time together, cut too short
Did I say enough? Speak freely
Did my words destroy?
Or was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Oh, was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?

When you're so hard to read
I wonder what you're hiding
Lying under the leaves
I'm not someone you confide in

Somehow in my head, it's overgrown
It's made me question everything I know
Did what you say contain an undertone?
It goes on and on and on

It keeps turning up, it won't leave me
Our time together, cut too short
Did I say enough? Speak freely
Did my words destroy?
Or was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Oh, was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Afterthought, afterthought

Get this, get this sound
Set this, set this down
