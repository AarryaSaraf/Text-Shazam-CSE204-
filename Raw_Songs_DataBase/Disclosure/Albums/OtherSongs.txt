// Control (Joe Goddard Remix) //

You can take control
Control, control

You're not, control, show me
Control, control

Control, control
Control

Let me catch my breath
Hope me do your chance
Feel our hearts cut out
From the other sign

Let me catch my breath
Hope me do your chance
Feel our hearts cut out
From the other sign

Control, control

Staring in your eyes
I felt my desire
You can't take control
Of the love we fight

You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me

Staring in your eyes
I felt my desire
You can't take control
Of the love we fight

Let me catch my breath

Control, control
Control, control

All we're fighting by the thought of losing out your beat alone
Won't be the one who has to see without you
By the time I know I want my way I know that you you wanna take me home
Let it happen and you'll be the one to

And you'll take the time to...
No back in time no... nothing else will come between us
With you enough to say no use and tell me what to do
All this...

Control, control
Control, control

You can't take control

// F For You (Remix) //

I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
They're manifested in words and the lies that you speak
[x4]

Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you
Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you
Because I
Because I
Because I
Because I

Boy, your love is so beautiful
And I'll play the fool for you
Boy, your love is so beautiful
And I'll play the fool for you, babe
It makes me feel so good when you hold me tight
Always want it back
You make everything alright!
Boy, your love is so beautiful
I'll play, I'll play, I'll play the fool for you

Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you
Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you
Because I
Because I
Because I
Because I

Boy, your love's got me in a daze
And I'll do anything you say
Boy, your love's got me in a daze
And I'll do anything you say, baby
You give me what I need (what I need)
(Whenever you're around) You're the one
You'll always be my king, can't nobody take your crown
Boy, your love is so beautiful
I'll play, I'll play, I'll play the fool for you

Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you
Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you

Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you
Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you

I'll play, I'll play
I'll play the fool, for you babe
I'll play

Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you
Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you

I'll play, I'll play, I'll play
I'll play, I'll play, I'll play
I'll play, I'll play, I'll play
I'll play, baby

I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats

// Hotline Bling //

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Boy, you got me down, you got me stressed out

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
You and me, we do not get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where we do not belong

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
You don't need no one else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

// Tenderly (Remix) //

[Verse 1: J2K]
Uhh, J
Where we going?
Oi Wiley
I'm tryna work out, how I'm gonna work with it
Certified money if I'm banking it
She's good food, I'm a good dude
Right, so I ain't gonna ramp with it
First class money, I put my stamp on it
Hold you right there, like a clamp's on it
And I'll pay the money to put my hands on it
Now that's fine, get it?
You get it and that's mine
Now we're good to go
She said she's single, and that's good to know
Cos she's a game changer like when the whistle blows
She's like a Christmas kiss under mistletoes
(Jheeze, jheeze)
Something about the way she
It's something that's so wavy
Got me overprotecting like she's a baby
Crazy

[Verse 2: Wiley]
She wanna see me putting work in
It's working, now we're in the dance circling
She got the look in her eye, I know it's worth it
Me and her being together, it seems perfect
She got something about her
I'm buzzing about her
Couple things that I'm loving about her
I've been searching
Everyday I wanna be round her, like her purses
Then I wanna talk about her in my verses
She like a Hershey bar, she got a sweet kiss
I be sipping a fruit punch, sweet lips
She gimme the feeling, so I done a remix
When I'm on the mic, I took the same route as a D6
Can't believe it, it's local love
I can see it, there's hope above
Had it all in my head, now I've spoken up
I was asleep, now I've woken up
She's mine

// Together //

Kiss my lips and taste the Sauvignon
I wrap the vines around your thighs
I can see the kind of tip you're on
There's no confusion in your eyes

Let's unwind together
Together
Ease our minds together
Together

Taking sips to push the moment on
But it's just the bottle that's run dry
Lose the watch cause we got nothing on
And I'm not keeping track of time!

Let's unwind together
Together
Ease our minds together
Together

Together
Together
Together

Ease our minds together [repeat]

// Waterfall //

I only see you and I
In a crowded room you're my decision
Oh we been blurring the lines
In a crowded room I guess I kissed him, kissed him

Oh now baby hold on, hold on
Pushed you back for so long
And I'm all out of good excuses now baby
Alright alright
I can't wait one more night
I give up, I give in, I can't take it

Won't you please
Pour your loving over me
All your loving over me
Like a waterfall baby

Won't you please
Pour your loving over me
All your loving over me

I need you to
Let your water fall
Oh now baby
Let me feel it all

This may be a mistake
But I want your tattoos on my shoulders
If you was bourbon and pain
I'd raise you to the sky and toast this, hopeless

Oh now baby hold on, hold on
Pushed you back for so long
And I'm all out of good excuses now baby
Alright alright
I can't wait one more night
I give up, I give in, I can't take it

Won't you please
Pour your loving over me
All your loving over me
Like a waterfall baby

Won't you please
Pour your loving over me
All your loving over me

I need you to
Let your water fall
Oh now baby
Let me feel it all

Give me something to live for
Give me something to love
Give me someone to hold on to
I'll put nothing above
Give me something to live for
Give me something to feel
Give me something to hold on to
Give me something that's real

Never had a lover like you, no
It's the kind of loving I do want
Settled so I'm settling
Love him and I'm telling him
Got a good girl in her element, yeah
Never had a lover like you, no
It's the kind of loving I do want
Settled so I'm settling
Love him and I'm telling him
Got a good girl in her element, yeah

Won't you please
Pour your loving over me
All your loving over me
Like a waterfall baby

Won't you please
Pour your loving over me
All your loving over me

I need you to
Let your water fall
Oh now baby
Let me feel it all

Won't you let your
Won't you let your
Won't you let your
Waterfall
Won't you let your
Won't you let your
Won't you let your
Waterfall

// Where Angels Fear To Tread //

Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head
Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head

Fools rush in
Where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know

When we met
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head
When we met
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head

Fools rush in
Where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know
Oh, oh, oh, oh

When we met
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head
Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head

Care, fool, fool
Care, fool

Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head

Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head
