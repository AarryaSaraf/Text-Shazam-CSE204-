// I Believe In You //

I believe in you
If you believe in me
And I believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony
United once again
We'll stand there hand in hand
And put love back together just the way

I believe in you
If you believe in me
And I believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony
United once again
We'll stand there hand in hand
And put love back together just the way we've always planned

I still remember how it used to be
Seclusion in our love so deep
A world to touch that meant so much to me
And promises we couldn't hope to keep

The cool romance and nights of ecstasy
Slip slowly by on paper wings
The cold reality of you and me
Came creeping like a storm cloud gathering

I believe in you
If you believe in me
And I believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony
United once again
We'll stand there hand in hand
And put love back together just the way we've always planned

The balance of our love hangs tenderly
A careful step through broken glass, yeah
One thoughtless word could kill a memory
And days we loved together in the past

I give and take I do my very best
To keep this vision that I've seen
I give respect if you could just accept
There never really was a perfect me

I believe in you
If you believe in me
And I believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony
United once again
We'll stand there hand in hand
And put love back together just the way we've always planned

You walk away and see yourself in retrospect
Remember all of love's first visions
Step aside try to see just what went wrong
Living together isn't easy all the time

I believe in you if you believe in me, oh
There's still the chance that we can find romance, yeah
I know we can

I believe in you
If you believe in me
And I believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony
United once again
We'll  stand there hand in hand
And put love back together just the way we've always planned
I believe in you, if you believe in me
I believe in you, I believe in you...
United undivided...

// True Love Survives //

On big alley stands a lady waiting
For awhile
Acting out an untold story like a
Wounded child
But the mystery of the circumstance
Won't hide
She believes true love survives
True love survives

Waiting for her long lost lover
Returning from the war
Though I know she knew the truth
She also knew much more
And the answer that she gave to all of us
Whispered low saying
True love survives
True love survives

Is she dreaming does she know
A secret I can't see
Maybe there's a trace of truth
In all that she believes

For one day I took a look deep down inside
A voice cried saying true love's alive
True love survives

Only love will last forever true love will survive
Only love will last forever true love will survive

True is love is never-ending
It's giving all and not pretending
It's holding on although your heart
Feels dead

A quarter of a century of years
Have gone by
Still the dream of this peculiar
Lady's kept alive
So I'm holding tight to one who I desired
A burning fire saying true love survives
True love survives

Only love will last forever
Only love will last forever

// You To Me //

Our love is an endless river
Keeps on flowing on and on forever
Each dream like a forest flower
Keeps on growing every hour

We can almost touch the horizon there
So reaching further
We can even light up a star ahead
I know we are bound by destiny
We will always be

You to me are everything
You to me are everything
My whole world's devoted to you
For you there's not a thing I wouldn't do
You to me are everything

Our love is a perfect circle
Has no start or end
It can't be broken
Stronger than a moment's weakness
It knows no secrets
We both believe it

No one's ever gonna come between
The love we're sharing
No one's gonna steal the way we got dream
'cause there's more to words that words can say
How can I explain?

You to me are everything
You to me are everything
My whole world's devoted to you
For you there's not a thing I wouldn't do
You to me are everything

You to me are everything
You to me are everything
You to me are everything
You to me are everything
You to me are everything

// Sweet Emotion //

Seems every star is out tonight to light our love
So round the moon so full and bright so high above
But if you look real closely there's only me, there's only you
And when you hold me closely, yeah

And now the sky melts in the sea like they are one
It's hard to tell where one first starts and where ends one
That's the way our love is
You part of me me part of you

That's just what love is

Sweet you got the sweetest emotion, baby
Sweet, sweet emotion
Sweet you got the sweetest emotion
Sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet

You took me from the surface to a deeper deep
Showing me that you
And you are life for me
Our love will last forever
Me loving you, you loving me
We'll always be together oh

Sweet you got the sweetest emotion
Sweet, sweet emotion
Sweet, sweet emotion
Sweet you got the sweetest emotion
Sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet

Sweet, you got the sweetest emotion
Sweet, you got the sweetest emotion
Listen baby
Listen to me
Sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet
Sweeter than sweet
You got the sweet emotion, yeah
Listen to me

// Leave Me Alone //

Say you dominate you can never wait
To listen to the things that I have got to say
You're amorous, polygamous
And that's okay as long as I don't start to play

Say listen good
You know you should
Paradise is built inside an hour glass
I'm feminine but that don't mean
That I would want to travel second class

Leave me alone 'cause I've got my rhythm (yeah)
Leave me alone 'cause I've got my life
Leave me alone 'cause I've got my rhythm
Just leave me alone
Just leave me alone
Leave me alone if you want to stay mine
Leave me alone

Now I am you and you are me
The signs are right and it will fit eventually
It's hard to take you'd better break
A habit that has ruled for an eternity

It's your concern you'd better learn
I'll never belong to you or any other man
Take what I give and go and live
With someone else if you don't understand

Leave me alone 'cause I've got my rhythm
Leave me alone 'cause I've got my life
Leave me alone 'cause I've got my rhythm
Just leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone if you want to stay mine
Leave me alone

Leave me alone if you want to stay mine for awhile
Leave me alone if you want to stay mine for awhile

Just leave me alone
You think you're hot stuff
You think you're so cool

// Melanie //

Melanie is sweet
A vision on her feet
So young so fair
A bridge of iron
Standing tall between two parted spheres
She's a novelty of reality
Though she tried so hard
My sweet darling Melanie

She's glad for what she's had
Her mom and several dads so she complained
This modern love affair
With life can really get you down

She's a novelty of reality
But she tried so hard my sweet darling Melanie

Ooh but life goes on
Ooh the same old song
Ooh but love's in search of mystery
So you worked so hard my sweet darling Melanie

Over the horizon
Birds of paradise sit in her eyes
You can feel forever on her sweet and silken sighs

She's novelty of reality
So she tried so hard my sweet darling Melanie
Na, na, na
She's novelty of reality
So she tried so hard my sweet darling Melanie
So she tried so hard my sweet darling Melanie
Na, na, na...

// Back Where You Belong //

Ooh I've been down there a million times
If I've been down before
Never thought I'd hurt so bad
To see you play the fool
Never mountain high enough
I said and I watched you climb
Till the day I saw you walk out of your life and mine

So I'm gonna leave you just because I want you
Back where you belong
Gonna make you see just what you've doing to me
Back where you belong
Be home right by my side is where you want to be
Back where you belong

Standing in the shadows
Watch your never-ending flight
Just how high as high to be before you see the light
Will this be the change you need to show you who you are
I love you but I'll leave you just to prove you've gone too far

Soon I'm gonna leave you just because I want you
Back where you belong
Gonna make you see just what you've doing to me
Back where you belong
Be home right by my side is where you want to be
Back where you belong

Can't you see you're losing me using me
Back where you belong
Heaven knows I love you will this make you see
Back where you belong

So I'm gonna leave you just because I want you
Back where you belong
Gonna make you see just what you've doing to me
Back where you belong
Be home right by my side is where you want to be
Back where you belong

Don't you understand my feelings and
Set me free
Don't you realize it...

// People Talk //

If people talk then let people talk
We won't hit the ground if we are the talk of the town
People talk gossiping past
Stabbing their words with all of their stares in our back
Let the people talk

If people talk grapevine of lies
Spinning their yarns
Spreading the seeds of our harm

People talk but we know the truth let them all talk
Baby it's still me and you

We'll face the fears and when the rumours blow
All the names they call will never hurt
Sticks and stones may break all of our bones
But all the King's men will put us together again

People talk so let people talk
We won't hit the ground if we are the talk of the town
People talk

People talk so let people talk
We won't hit the ground if we are the talk of the town
People talk grapevine of lies
Spinning their yarns
Spreading the seeds of our harm

// To Turn The Stone //

The moon retreats behind a silver cloud
As darkness throws its cloak towards the earth
And mystery replaces what thought we knew

To turn the stone, to turn the stone

The one dimension only shows one side
But do we see the same through different eyes
As you and I peer into life's kaleidoscope

To turn the stone, to turn the stone

Eternal sands of time shift endlessly
Behind a veil of motionless disguise
An eyelid flash is all it really seems to need

To turn the stone, to turn the stone
To turn the stone, to turn the stone

// Brooklyn //

// I'm A Rainbow //

Is there a remedy for the passions of the soul
Brother if there is one I don't really know
Have I let my imagination run out of control
I'm a rainbow
Just a rainbow

Am I living here in this nameless state
It's light on darkness sound of silence
I just can't get it straight
See I don't wanna be no one that I ain't
I'm a rainbow
Just a rainbow

And all the colors that you see
Are all part of me
In this crazy world of mine

Like the wind that blows
The trees are sailing for the breeze
Ever changing all the time

I'm a rainbow just a rainbow
Ever changing all the time
I'm a rainbow colorful rainbow
Sometimes I shine

And all the colors that you see
Are all part of me
In this crazy world of mine

Like the wind that blows
The trees are sailing for the breeze
Ever changing all the time

Da, da, da ,da,da...

Like the wind that blows
The trees are sailing for the breeze
Ever changing all the time

I'm a rainbow just a rainbow
And sometimes I can shine
I'm a rainbow just a rainbow...

// Walk On (Keep On Moving) //

Walk on
Keep on walking and don't look back
You gotta keep on down the track
The future's yours to shape and mold
The past is past beyond control
So walk on
Walk on
Baby walk on
Walk on
Walk on

You gotta struggle up them hills
To realize the downward thrill
When night confuses where you are
Then just look up at that guiding star
So walk on
Walk on
Baby walk on

Baby baby let me walk with you (walk on)
Baby baby let me walk (walk on)

The wind may blow the sky may fall
But if you're strong you'll go through it all
And just as long as your aim is true
There'll come a day your goal's in view
So come on

Baby baby let me walk with you
Baby baby let me walk

Keep on moving
Keep on moving

And when you reach where you belong
You'll find it's where you first started from
And through it all you're still the same
You swear it's them not you who's changed

So walk on walk on walk on
Keep on moving
Just keep on moving yeah
Better keep on moving yeah

// Don't Cry For Me Argentina //

This won't be easy
You'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love
After all that I've done

You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to nines
For sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen
I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window
Staying out of the sun
So I choose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it too

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise, don't keep your distance

And as for fortune
And as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it appeared to the world
They were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you, and hope you love me

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise,
Don't keep your distance
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

// A Runner With The Pack //

He's got a second side he's got sixth sense
He got everything
He got what it takes
He got what it makes to be everything
Seems to know all there is to know
I took him there
He steals the show
He's so astute he's so acute he's gold sure he is
He's eloquent he's intelligent and benevolent
He's the epitome of ability with his expertise
He's versatile with a lot of style
He'd mess my heart every time he'd smile
So unpretentious a warm and gentle soul

A runner with the pack, no he's not like that
A runner with the pack, no he's not like that
Cause he's inventive, attentive, protective, selective
Perceptive, receptive, affective, reflective
A runner with the pack, no he'd never do that

He got tolerance he got confidence he's significant
And he's a connoisseur and a social stir he's magnificent
So fair and square he reciprocates
And every way he stimulates
His quality of voracity is great

A runner with the pack, no he's not like that
A runner with the pack, no he's not like that
Cause he's inventive, attentive, protective, selective
Perceptive, receptive, effective, reflective
(you know the he's)
A runner with the pack, no he'd never do that

// Highway Runner //

Highway lead him to where he's never been
Show that drifter what he's never seen
Introduce him to this
Acquaint him with that
Gotta keep searching like a stray stray cat

Highway runner chasing time since the day he was born
Highway runner racing time around the world one more time
For one more time

It ain't even me can hold him down
Country just a breath from town to town
He got restless feet and a restless mind
Never wanna travel through the same place twice

Highway runner chasing time since the day he was born
Highway runner racing time around the world one more time
For one more time

One more time
One more time
One more time
You're gonna meet your match...

// Romeo //

My baby wears his heart on his sleeve
He wears a look on his face that says please please please
Love it everything he flaunts love it
Everything he vaunts I just can't hesitate
When he wants what he wants

Oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka
And I said oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka

Last night he calls me on the telephone
You know at two in the morning I just want to sleep on
But he got a way with words and
He got a way with charm
You know at three in the morning he's back into my arms

And I said oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka
And I said oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka

He's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy
He's my Romeo oh, oh
He's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy
He's my R-O-M-E-O, Romeo
He's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy
He's my Romeo oh, oh
He's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy
He's mine

My my Romeo, my my Romeo, my my Romeo, my my Romeo

He looks so good the girls stop and stare
But I soon wanna look with his double dark hair
I'm not gonna let him go
I'm not taking any chance
It's a one in million mad mad romance

Oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka
Oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka

He's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy
He's my Romeo oh, oh

He's my R-O-M-E-O, Romeo
He's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy, he's the boy
He's my Romeo oh, oh

He's mine, Romeo
My my Romeo, my my Romeo
He's my Romeo
My my Romeo

My my Romeo, he's my Romeo
My Romeo..

// End Of The Week //

I get out of work
And then I throw away all of my cares
I get out of work
And then I wash the week out my hair

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
It's hard as could be
But by old Friday evening
We're free, we're free, we're free

End of the week
The weekend started
Been working so hard to play
End of the week
It's time to party
End of the week
End of the week
End of the week

You're tasting freedom
No one to push you around
End of the week
And life has a reason
End of the week
End of the week
End of the week

Street are alive
You know everybody's going somewhere
You put on the slide
You gotta beat the crowd just everywhere

And all the music all the dancing
Get you so high
And all that sweet romancing
Oh my, oh my, oh my

End of the week
The weekend started
Working so hard to play
End of the week
It's time to party
End of the week
End of the week
End of the week

Feels good now
Feels good now
End of the week
End of the week

It's real good now
Real good now
End of the week
End of the week
End of the week

// I Need Time //

Five to nine
Early Sunday morning around breakfast time
I heard a sudden tapping at the kitchen door
Oh and there was more
Well it was you I saw

No mistake
I knew you'd come around that sad look on your face
Then you begged me to come in and I said yes
Oh what a fool I am
I should have turned away

I need time
To turn the time around
To let it all hang out
To fight my fear and fight my doubt
I need time
To turn the time around
(get ahold) of love
Spoken words don't mean enough

No mistake
Remember not to break the promise that you make
I'll meet you fifty fifty in the middle now
And I won't back out
There'd better be no doubt

I need time
To turn the time around
Little did I know that love would bring you to my door
I need time
To turn the time around
Little did I know that love was on our side

I love you you know I
You know I always will love you now
I know I do love you
You know I'll always be true to you my love

Here you stand
Torn up yellow T-shirt and guitar in hand
I wanna love you now
Oh forget the past
I wanna make love last

I need time
To turn the time around
Let it all hang out
Love will bring you back again

I need time
To turn the time around
Little did I know that I love will bring you back again
