// Celebrate Me Home //

Home for eternity
I believe I miss each and every face
Come on and play some music
Turn on every love light in this place
I've got to find myself
Totally surrounded in loves circles of all my friends

Please, celebrate me home
Play me a number
Please, celebrate me home
Play me one more song
That I'll always remember
That I can recall whenever I find myself so all alone
(Take me home)

Life's uneasy highway
Blowin' where the western winds won't blow
Somebody tried to tell me but they forgot to tell me why
I got to come on home, come on home, come on home
Be what you want from me
I'll be strong, I'll be here

Please, celebrate me home
Play me a number
Please, celebrate me home
Ah, don't be sorry I will never remember
That I can recall the moment I
I left myself so all alone
Never remember when I have gone
But I'll tell you that now
On my grave I belong - take me home
Celebrate me home
Play me a number
Please, celebrate me home
Ah, don't be sorry I...

Now, Donna, don't be sorry I'm gone
Just remember that where I am
There's no tears, no pain, no pain, no, no more sorrows!
Please, celebrate me home, ah, ah, ah
Please, celebrate me home, oh, oh
The fathers here, I'm not alone
So celebrate me home
The fathers here, I'm not alone
So celebrate me home
The fathers here, I'm not alone
So celebrate me home
(The fathers here...)
Please, celebrate me home
Ah, ah, the fathers here, I'm not alone
So celebrate me home
I'm finally here, I'm never alone
So celebrate me home
Please, celebrate me home (celebrate me...)
So glad I made it home - thank you Jesus!

It's been a long long time
Since the day we've been apart

// I Got Your Love //

[Chorus:]
I got your love
It's all that i got
I got your love
It's all i ever think about
I got your love
Every last drop
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
It's all I ever think about
It's all I ever think about

Baby In the heart of my heart I want more
Of the man who just walked through that door
The only one that my eyes see

Baby the moments have drifted away
And the hours became lonely days
You're the answer to what i have prayed
I, I will be good to you
I, I will be good to you

[Chorus]

Baby, losing you's all that i fear
And i'm losing it when you're not here
I never could go on without you

Baby, I feel like a shower of light
And I need you right here by my side
I'm craving you all of my life

I, I will be good to you
I, I will be good to you

[Chorus]

Aaah you move me
Baby
Aaah you move me

I got your love
It's all I ever think about
I got your love
Every last drop
I got your love
It's all I ever think about
All I ever think about (come to me baby)
All I ever think about (come to me baby)
All I ever think about
Your love

// I Will Go With You (Con Te Partiro) //

Stranded alone on a sea of emotion
You found me
Your love was a light
In the darkness that shone
So profoundly
Say that you'll stay
Do not be afraid, afraid
You, you're my breath
The air I breathe
You are my imagination
Su le finesse
Song of my heart
Secrets I'm not afraid to whisper

Con te partiro
I'll go where you lead me
Wherever you are
(forever and ever we'll stay)
In love together
I will go with you
I'll go where you lead me
Forever true
(forever and ever we'll stay)
In love together

Stranded alone on a sea of emotion
You found me
It's you who first found me
Come here, come here
Put your arms around me,
Come here
It's you who surrounds me
Come here, come here
Come here
Come here
You, you're my breath
The air I breathe
You are my imagination
Su le finesse
Song of my heart
Secrets I'm not afraid to whisper

I will go with you
I'll go where you lead me
Forever true
(forever and ever we'll stay)
In love together
Con te partiro
I'll go where you lead me
Wherever you are
(forever and ever we'll stay)
In love together
I will go with you
I'll go where you lead me
Forever true
(forever and ever we'll stay)
In love together

Con te partiro
I'll go where you lead me,
Wherever you are
I will go with you
I'll go where you lead me
Forever true
In my...
Heart!

// Love Is The Healer //

So many times in my life
I've been alone, left alone
Heart broken and
Turned around
I find myself
Crying in the night time
Dying out loud
In the night I sleeplessly
Wake up
From a dream that's
Tormenting me
I, I, I, I, I gotta get help
Oh, yeah

Love is the healer
Love is the healer
Come heal me
Love is the healer
Love is the healer
Set me free

Late at night I was afraid
And I tried to turn away
I was afraid to face
What in-evil-it-able is

Say you know the way
To find true freedom
Can you save yourself
From the pain you're feeling
Something in my head
That you're dreaming
That the angels said

Love is the healer
Love is the healer
Come heal me
Love is the healer
Love is the healer
Set me free
Love is the healer
Love is the healer
Come heal me
Love is the healer
Love is the healer
Set me free

I am on a mission, a mission of love
I am on a mission, a mission of love
I am on a mission, a mission of love
I am on a mission, a mission of love
I am on a mission, a mission of love

Love...is the healer

Love is the healer
Come as a healer
Set me free
Love is the healer
Come as a healer
Set me free
Love is the healer
Come as a healer
Set me free
Love is the healer
Come as a healer
Set me free

Do you know the way to love
Do you know the place of love
Do you know what love
Can do
Do you know what
It'll do for you

// My Life //

When I was young
I used to dream of going far
Having my once, in a lifetime change
To prove I was a star.
A thousand times you stood
In the wings
Dreaming it was me,
I heard the people going wild
But it was just my fantasy

Life is a dance
And baby we're just players
So stand up and smile
And don't be afraid

[Chorus:]
This is my night
This is my song
Standing right here
Out on the stage
Is where I belong
This is my song
This is my night
Standing right here
Out on the stage
In the spotlight

I traveled the road
Wherever the road would lead
I made mistakes but I
Wouldn't quit
I made myself believe
Dreams come true
For those who dream
So one day you can say
The music be the fruit of life
And let the music play.

Life is a dance
And baby we're just players
So stand up and smile
And don't be afraid

[Chorus]

[Bridge 8x:]
This is my life
This is my life

// No More Tears (Enough Is Enough) //

It's raining, it's pouring
My lovelife is boring me to tears
After all these years

No sunshine, no moonlight
No stardust, no sign of romance
We don't stand a chance

I've always dreamed I'd found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man
Our love, our love

Raining (raining)
Pouring (pouring)
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waste another tear

If you've had enough
Don't put up with his stuff
Don't you do it
If you've had your fill
Get the check pay the bill
You can do it

Tell him to just get out
Nothing left to talk about
Pack his raincoat show him out
Just look him in the eyes and simple shout

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on, no more no
Enough is enough, is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough

If you've reached the end
Don't pretend that it's right
When it's over (It's over)
If the feeling is gone
Don't think twice just move on
Get it over (over, over)
Tell him to just get out, say it clearly, spell it out

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on, no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough

I've always dreamed to find the perfect lover
But he turns out to be like every other man
Our love (I had no choice from the start)
Our love (I've gotta listen to my heart)
Our love (tearing us apart)

Enough, is enough, is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough, is enough, is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Enough is enough

No more tears (no more tears)
No more tears (no more tears)
No more tears (no more tears)
No more tears (no more tears)
Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough
I've had it, you've had it, he's had it, we've had it
Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough
I've had it, you've had it, he's had it, we've had it

I always dreamed I'd found the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man

I had no choice from the start
I've gotta listen to my heart
Tearing us apart

Enough is enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on, no more no
Enough is enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Goodbye mister, goodbye, goodbye mister, goodbye sugar

It's raining, it's pouring
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waste another tear

No more tears
Is enough is enough is enough is enough
Is enough is enough is enough is ENOUGH!!!

// On The Radio //

Someone found a letter you wrote me on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name but I knew just who they meant

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
I was so surprised and shocked, and I wondered too
If, by chance, you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling over you
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air

On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Now, now, don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing that I wanna hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, it kinda made me feel proud when I heard him say
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself
And now in my heart I know I can say what I really feel
'Cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air

On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio

If you think that love isn't found on the radio
Then tune right in, you may find the love you lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
It sounded really loud, they said it really loud

On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio

// On The Radio (Long Version) //

Someone found a letter you wrote me on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name but I knew just who they meant

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
I was so surprised and shocked, and I wondered too
If, by chance, you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling over you
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air

On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh

On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio

Sending in a letter to tell them that I love you too
If you hear it maybe you will know
When you hear them read the line about love's return on the radio
You'll think about the two of us, and you'll come home

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
If you knew just how I felt why you made me wait
Life goes on and on why you play with my heart
Don't hold out any longer, 'cause now I know how you really feel
'Cause I heard it really loud, they said it on the air

On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Now if you think that love isn't found on the radio
Then tune right in, you may find the love you lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
It sounded really loud, they said it really loud

On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh
On the radio, whoa-oh-oh-oh

// Something's In The Wind //

Lately you've changed
Acting so strange
If something's wrong
Don't drag it on

'Cause each time I phone
You're never home
Each time we meet out on the street
You hardly speak

Ooh baby something's in the wind
Ooh baby are we near the end
I know baby something's in the wind
So why pretend

Ooh baby something's in the wind
Ooh baby tell me what it is
Something baby is blowing in the wind
Out in the wind

Nothing has changed
That's what you say
So how come each date
You turn up late

You say I'm wrong
Your love's still strong
So how come each kiss
Means less and less

Ooh baby something's in the wind
Ooh baby are we near the end
I know baby something's in the wind
So why pretend

Ooh baby something's in the wind
Ooh baby tell me what it is
Something's baby is blowing in the wind
Out in the wind

// Tearin' Down The Walls //

(Tearing down tearing down tearing...)

I know the rhythm of the music
I see the beat in the dark
Emotion got me where I'm with him
It's so hard to get to your heart

Fascination you know it brought me to you
Satisfaction makes me want to
Want to start by tearing down the walls
Tearing down the walls around your heart
Tearing down the walls
Tearing down the walls around your heart

I know I'm only getting so close
I see you're up on your guard
Secrets I wanna get to know those
'Cause down deep I'm after your heart

All I'm giving is some good old-fashioned love
(Wanna give it all to ya)
I wanna give to ya prove it to you
Let me start by tearing down the walls
Tearing down the walls around your heart
Tearing down the walls
Tearing down the walls around your heart

Oh tearing down
Wanna take the time to show ya
Really wanna get to know ya
Oh tearing down

Let me start by tearing down the walls
Tearing down the walls around your heart
Tearing down the walls
Tearing down the walls around your heart

(Tearing down tearing down tearing...)

Fascination you know it brought me to you, oh
Satisfaction makes me want to
Want to start by tearing down the walls
Tearing down the walls around your heart
Tearing down the walls
Tearing down the walls around your heart

// The Power Of One //

You must always remember

Life can be a challenge
Life can seem impossible
It's never easy
When so much
Is on the line
But you can make a difference
With courage
You can set things right
A gift to dream
And make dreams real
Is yours and mine

The power of one
Begins with believing
It starts in the heart
Then flows through the soul
And changes the world
Imagine how life will be
When we stand in unity
Each of us holds the key
To the power of one

Each of us is chosen
There's a mission just for you
Just look inside
You'd be surprised what you can do

The Power of one
Begins with believing
It starts in the heart
Then flows through the soul
And changes the world
Imagine how life will be
When we stand in unity
Each of us holds the key
To the power of one

One by one
We can make the world
A much better place

The power of one
Begins with believing
It start in the heart
Then flows through the soul
And changes the world
Imagine how life will be
When we stand in unity
Each of us holds a key
It's inside of you and me
Each of us holds the key
To the power of one

The power of one

// They Can't Take Away Our Music //

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Don't let no one
No one get you down
'Cause if they do
If they do I'll be around

I want you near
Standing here by my side
So my dear wipe
Those tears from your eyes

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Don't let no one
No one get you down
'Cause if they do
If they do I'll be around

I want to see
You round me all the time
I want you to know that I am yours
And you are mines

Let nobody get you down
(Hey)
Let nobody get you down
Let nobody get you down

Let nobody get you down
Let nobody get you down
Let nobody get you down
(You keep me happy all the time)

Let nobody get you down
(You keep me happy, happy all the time)
Let nobody get you down
(You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you)

// Virgin Mary //

Look at the lady with the crazy stare in her eyes
Looks way past fifty though she's barely thirty-five
Sleeps most days in the city park
Every night down at Casey's bar
And if she talks at all you'll hear her say
"I was a lovely girl in my younger days"

She was the prettiest girl this town had ever seen
But she dresses too gaudy for the likes of the people here
Out every night living life to the full
A string of men at her beck and call
But small-town people got small-town ways
And soon she was stuck with a brand new name

Hey Virgin Mary-lover of lovers
Hey Virgin Mary-how many others
Hey Virgin Mary-your bed is never empty
Hey Virgin Mary-it must bring you plenty

Oh that fateful night there was thunder in the air
The women were angry and the men felt like a share
A lynch mob frenzy came over the town
Grabbed hold of Mary, threw her down to the ground
The first man there that had Mary laid
Staggered back with shock on his face

Hey Virgin Mary-you're true to your name
Hey Virgin Mary-we've put you to shame
Hey Virgin Mary-you're not what we thought
Hey Virgin Mary-the victim of talk

Hey Virgin Mary, Hey Virgin Mary-rumour was your ruin
Hey Virgin Mary-evil talk was your undoing
Hey Virgin Mary-heavy on the conscience
Hey Virgin Mary-jealous talk and nonsense
Hey Virgin Mary-you were really like your name
Hey Virgin Mary-and we put you to shame
Hey Virgin Mary-you're not really what we thought
Hey Virgin Mary-jealous talk and nonsense
