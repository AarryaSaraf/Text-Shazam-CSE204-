Album: TheWanderer

// The Wanderer //

Woke up this morning
Dragged myself across the bed
Alice went to wonderland
But I stayed home instead
I started feeling bad
'Cause I was left behind
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Whoooa, I'm a wanderer

She climbed right through the mirror
Oh that really blew my mind
I think I'll follow through her rhythm
And her rhyme
I know I'm ready now
It's just a little time
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Whoooa, I'm a wanderer

'Cause I'm a wanderer
I travel every place
'Cause I'm a wanderer
From here to outer space
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Got no time
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Whooooa, just a wanderer

Slipped down the back stair
On my toes
Then out the door
They didn't hear
Now they won't see me anymore
'Cause I'm can't take
That nine to five life
It's a bore
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Yeaaaah, just a wanderer

And so it's up and out
And on and off the road
Won't have no troubles
'Cause the whole world is my home
No need to worry
'Cause I seldom am alone
'Cause I'm wanderer
Whooooa, I'm a wanderer

'Cause I'm a wanderer
I travel every place
'Cause I'm a wanderer
From here to outer space
'Cause I'm wanderer
Got no time
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Whooooa, just a wanderer

[Instrumental Interlude]

'Cause I'm a wanderer
Whooooa, just a wanderer

Now you may see me
Any time and any place
And you may know me
From the same look
On your face
And I don't know if I could
Change your frame of mind
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Whooooa, just a wanderer

'Cause I'm a wanderer
I travel every place
'Cause I'm a wanderer
From here to outer space
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Got no time
'Cause I'm a wanderer
'Cause I'm a wanderer
'Cause I'm a wanderer

'Cause I'm a wanderer
I travel every place
'Cause I'm a wanderer
From here to outer space
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Got no time
'Cause I'm a wanderer
I travel every place
'Cause I'm a wanderer
From here to outer space
'Cause I'm a wanderer
Got no time

// Looking Up //

Looking up, again
I'm coming back to life
I'm coming back to life
Looking up, to you
If was really up to you
You had to pull me through
Looking up

Looking up, a change is
Coming over me
I know now that I'm free
Looking up, I find
I'm walking tall and proud
And happy all the time

Looking up
I'm looking up
Looking up
I see my troubles far behind
Looking up
(I'm looking up)
Looking up
I feel I'm rising to the top
Looking up

Looking up, a change is
Coming over me
I know now that I'm free
Looking up, I find
I'm walking tall and proud
And happy all the time

Looking up
I'm looking up
Looking up
I see my troubles far behind
Looking up
(I'm looking up)
Looking up
I feel I'm rising to the top
Looking up

Someone that understands
Is there until the end
To hold the light for me
The light that help me see
And in my darkest hours
Will come with sunny showers
To help me to forget
Oh I so glad we met
And since that rainy day
The clouds just stay away
You chase them with your love
The greatest love I've known
'cause in the darkest hour
You come with sunny showers
My life is your today
Don't ever go away

Looking up
I'm looking up
I see my trouble far behind
Looking up
(I'm looking up)
Looking up
I feel I'm rising to the top...

// Breakdown //

Breakdown, shakedown again
Breakdown, over you
Breakdown, way down again
Breakdown, over you, over you

Just when our love appeared to be
Growing strong
And just when you believed that
We both belonged
You catch me out a cheating and
Foolin' 'round
You find that I'm lyin'
I feel like I'm dyin'
Here I come cryin' again

Breakdown, shakedown again
Breakdown, over you
Breakdown, way down again
Breakdown, over you, over you

I put you through this whole
Affair before
I broke it up, you broke it up even more
Then I begged you to patch it all
Up again
Why did you listen to me
You should have let it all be
You shouldn't put all your trust me

Breakdown, shakedown again
Breakdown, over you
Breakdown, way down again
Breakdown, over you, over you

Breakdown, let down again
Breakdown, over you
Breakdown, straight down again
Breakdown, over you, over you

// Grand Illusion //

Oh grand illusion, like to fade away
Take me and go out and play, oh yeah
It's no intrusion, it's like a rainy day
That can wash the clouds away of this pain inside

Harmony, we need harmony
Find the melody that puts our hearts in tune
Harmony, we need harmony
Simple symphony that makes us feel brand new

Oh grand illusion, like to fade away
Take me and go out and play, Oh yeah
It's no intrusion, it's like a rainy day
That can wash the clouds away of this pain inside

Harmony, we need harmony
Find the melody that puts our hearts in tune
Harmony, we need harmony
Simple symphony that makes us feel brand new
Harmony, harmony

Oh grand illusion, like to fade away
Take me and go out and play, Oh yeah
It's no intrusion, it's like a rainy day
That can wash the clouds away of this pain inside

Come on now, boy, put it on the line
Take some space just to ease your mind
And to think it through

// Running For Cover //

Spent the best of my life running scared
In the city
Left my shoes and my clothes and
My lovers behind, yeah
Oh but I felt incomplete
Living out there in the street

I was always alone and afraid
Such a pity
Little girls just don't know what comes
Out after dark
But the devil wasn't in here
Down on that dead end street

And I say
Running for cover
Running for cover
Running for cover
It's take keeping me running
I'm just scared that he's out tonight
It's keeping me running
I don't know why, but its getting dark
Say the devil's in the park
And its already after dark
Running for cover
Running for cover
Running for cover, now

Life is really so hard when you live in the city
No one know what a young girl
Has on her mind, yeah
But you're headed for defect
Down on that dead end street

Never learned of the lesson
You should, such a pity
Still and all you'll stay away
The others behind
And the promise in the dark
Is that the devil's in the park

And I say
Running for cover
Running for cover
Running for cover
It's take keeping me running
I'm just scared that he's out tonight
It's keeping me running
I don't know why, but its getting dark
Say the devil's in the park
And its already after dark

Running for cover
Running for cover
Running for cover
Spent the best of my life running scared
In the city
Left my shoes and my clothes and
My lovers behind, yeah
Oh but I felt incomplete
Living out there in the street

Running for cover
Running for cover
Running for cover
It's take keeping me running
I'm just scared that he's out tonight
It's keeping me running
I don't know why, but its getting dark
Say the devil's in the park
And its already after dark

// Cold Love //

I'm walking the line
I'm walking the line
Treading thin ice
Time after time

I go for the best, end up with much less
I need the real thing
Forget all the rest
Oh yeah, alright

Started out good
Working out bad
All the sweet love turner
Sour and sad

A face and name
It's always the same
So tired of playing love's foolish games
Tell me why
Love passes me by

Cold love, cold love
Another shot of rock'n'roll love
Cold love, cold love
Whatever happened to that
Good old love
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Tell me why, tell me why

Hope in the dark, love in the light
I'll keep on looking for someone
Who's right

I'm out for the best
Can you stand the test
I need the real thing
No more and no less
Tell me why
Love passes me by

Cold love, cold love
Another shot of rock'n'roll love
Cold love, cold love
Whatever happened to that
Sweet old love
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Tell me why, tell me why

Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why
Tell me why, tell me why

Cold love, cold love
Whatever happened to that
Sweet old love
Cold love, cold love
Another shot of rock'n'roll love
Cold love, cold love
Whatever happened to that
Sweet old love
Cold love, cold love
Whatever happened to that
Sweet old love

// Who Do You Think You're Foolin' //

You made it to the bright lights
You only come alive at night
You're one of the sights

You hang out with those big names
A rising star out on the gain

That's the price of your fame

(Fame is only a dream land away)

Who do you think you're foolin'
(you're foolin')
Who do you think you are
Who do you think you're foolin'
You're a star, you're a star
Who do you think you're foolin'
(you're foolin')
Who do you think you are
Who do you think you're foolin'
You're a star, such a star, you're a star?

You're halfway up the ladder
Or are you really halfway down
You never know in this town
But you swear you're gonna make it
And you don't care how you fake your life
You're gonna make it alright

(Fame is only a dream world away)

Who do you think you're foolin'
(you're foolin')
Who do you think you are
Who do you think you're foolin'
You're a star, you're a star
Who do you think you're foolin'
(you're foolin')
Who do you think you are
Who do you think you're foolin'
You're a star, such a star, you're a star?

Fame is only a dream world away
Fame is only a dream world away

Who do you think you're foolin'
(you're foolin')
Who do you think you are
Who do you think you're foolin'
You're a star, you're a star
Who do you think you're foolin'
(you're foolin')
Who do you think you are
Who do you think you're foolin'
You're a star, such a star, you're a star?

// Nightlife //

Debra waitin' on the corner
Flarin' smile and darin' style
Big "G" cruising, neon flashin'
Lost and found
Tinsel town

Day time orphans join the circus
Climb the rope and walk
The wire
To feel the night and the
Music playing
Feed the fire
To feed the fire

Night life, only living for
The night life
It's the only kind of night life
I only come alive for night life

Couples coasting, singles
Searching
Loners lost among the crowd
Action turning on reaction
Lose up
Fool around

Pretzel vendor, first class
Spender
Limousine and ketchup dream
Pinball hall and roulette roller
Every scene
For everything

Night life, only livin' for
The night life
It's the only kind of night life
I only come alive for night life
Night life, only livin' for
The night life
It's the only kind of night life
I only come alive for night life

Night life, night life
It's the only kind of night life
I only come alive for night life
Night life,
It's the only kind of night life
I only come alive for night life

// Stop Me //

I was weak and I was blind
You know I never ever wanted to put
Our love on the line

You were right, and I was wrong
I should have listened to the words
You said
But I was too headstrong

So if you've heard this all before
Don't let me carry on no more

Stop me, stop me if you think you've
Heard this one, this one
Stop me, stop me if you think you've
Heard this one
Stop me, stop me if you think you've
Heard this one, this one
Stop me, stop me, stop me

You said I lied, you said I cried
But I had to say something fast in case
You threw me aside

I didn't know, I couldn't guess
If I only would have known I never
Would have been in this mess

But if you've heard this all before
Don't let me carry on no more

Stop me, stop me if you think you've
Heard this one, this one
Stop me, stop me if you think you've
Heard this one
Stop me, stop me if you think you've
Heard this one, this one
Stop me, stop me, stop me

But if you've heard this all before
Don't let me carry on no more

Stop me, stop me if you think you've
Heard this one, this one
Stop me, stop me if you think you've
Heard this one
Stop me, stop me if you think you've
Heard this one, this one
Stop me if you think you've
Heard this one, this one
Stop me if you think you've
Heard this one, this one

// I Believe In Jesus //

Ran into mother Mary down on Vine
Street in L.A.
She was preaching the gospel
She was singing how Jesus saves
When a crowd of passing tourists
Looked to see what they could see
You know before they know it she had
Them all down on their knees

I believe in Jesus you know I know him
Oh so well
And I'm going to heaven by and by
'cause I already been through hell
I believe in Jesus, in Jesus, in Jesus
I believe in Jesus, in Jesus

So onward Christian soldiers still
Marching as to war
With the cross of Jesus just going on before
Now Jesus was a little lamb, his fleece
Was white as snow
And every where that Jesus went
This lamb is sure to go

Well I believe in Jesus you know I know him
Oh so well
And I'm going to heaven by and by
'cause I saved my soul from going to hell
I believe in Jesus, in Jesus, in Jesus
I believe in Jesus, in Jesus

Look at the sheep 'cause they're
Running fast
They wanna make it through the gates
At last

So onward Christian soldiers still
Marching as to war
With the cross of Jesus just going on before
I believe in Jesus, in Jesus
I believe in Jesus, in Jesus.....
