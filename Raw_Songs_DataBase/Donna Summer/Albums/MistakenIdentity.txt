Album: MistakenIdentity

// Get Ethnic //

[Rap:]
Lying here in the sun just trying to get a tan
Trying to find a look to go with the plan

Everyone's different
Everyone's go their thing
Spinman give me a rhythm...swing, swing

You don't have to dance alone
You get on the floor and make yourself at home
Do anything you want to do
It's alright... it's all up to you

[Ethnic chorus:]
It doesn't matter what skin you're in
Baby let the groove begin
Get ethnic...all day
Get ethnic...all night
'gonna chill and ride the day out
People let me tell you what it's all about
Get ethnic...all day
Get ethnic...all night long

[Talk:]
Walk my way!!!
Talk my way!!!

This is a new direction
We're gonna take it to the street
Spinman throw down a funky beat
Ooh sweet
Don't really care where you come from
You may move to a different drum
Jump right in and take you place
We're all part of the human race

[Ethnic chorus]

Like you mama do
And your daddy too
It's an attitude

[Ethnic chorus 2x]

Everybody's different
And we all have a song to sing
Spinman do your rhythm thing...swing...swing
Spinman do your rhythm thing...swing...swing

[Ethnic chorus]

C'mon c'mon baby
Smooth me out
Smooth me out
[Chant fade]

// Body Talk //

I can tell
By the way you stare at me

[Talk:]
It's deep...real deep
Your mind's messed up
Words just don't come easily

[Talk:]
It should be natural
Your invitation...baby
Turned my head around
Quiet conversation
Language without sound

Body talk...work your body
Everybody let your body talk
Body talk...work your body
Everybody needs some body talk

The guy with me
He's just a friend of mine

[Talk:]
It's purely platonic
So if you're tuff enuff
Baby step across the line

[Talk:]
Girlfriend don't bite
My imagination...baby
Bound to blow my mind

Body talk...work your body
Everybody let your body talk
Body talk...work your body
Everybody needs some body talk

Body talk
I can hear your body talk
Speak to me baby
Body talk
I can hear your body talk
Speak to me baby
Body talk
I can hear your body talk
Body talk
I can hear your body, body, body, body
Talk

I get the picture...baby
Come on over here
Your lips ain't moving
But I hear you loud and clear

[Chorus out]

// Work That Magic //

Only you...

[Talk:]
And the man and woman fall in love
And it's magic...pure magic!
(work that magic)
All alone
On a night like this
With nothing to do
But think about you

Under the moon
Two lovers kiss
And all I can do
Is think about you

I fall in love with you
Day  after day after day
Baby in New York heartbeat
A herd of wild horses
Could not keep me away
And that's no promise
That's a guarantee

[Chorus:]
Without your
My heart is frantic
Distant love can become tragic
When we touch
It's so romantic
Only you can work that magic
Only you...can work that magic [3x]

In my heart
I hold your hand
I'm gonna be true
So true to you baby

And I've decided
To make a love stand
Next to you, right next to you baby
I fall in love with you [etc]

[Chorus]

When the night
Comes closing in
Be there for me, be there baby

We'll sail away
To a magic land
Stay forever...stay forever

Tenderly you call my name
Turned my heart into a burning flame

[Chorus]

Without you
My heart is frantic
When we touch
It's so romantic
So romantic
C'mon now...work it
Work that magic [4x]

// When Love Cries //

Baby you
Turned my world into something new
Nights are long when you're far away
Hunger for you every night and day
Whisper softly to the wind
Need you back in my arms again
Passion calls from deep inside
It only happens when my love cries

You make my heart sing [3x]
When love cries
You make my heart sing [3x]
When love cries...love cries...love cries

And when I am blue
Close my eyes and dream of you
Silent echoes scream out your name
You're the keeper of my flame
I'll survive on desire
'til I'm closer to your burning fire
Ride a star across the sky
I need you here when my love cries

You make my heart sing [3x]
When love cries
You make my heart sing [3x]
When love cries...love cries
You make my hear sing [6x]
When love cries

Ooh baby
To be near you
Just to feel you

Baby, baby
Baby, baby
You do it to me...do it to me
Baby, baby
Baby, baby
You do it to me...

[Rap:]
In my heart
I never felt it quite like this before
And if I let it slip
I might not hear it anymore
I look into your eyes...ooh
And I get a chill
I hear your name
My world comes to a stand-still

The keeper of your flame
I wanna be
Two hearts together
'til eternity
Hand in hand
Side by side
Stride by stride
We'll be the one who hear
When love cries

You make my heart sing...

// Heaven's Just A Whisper Away //

Watching raindrops, slowly falling
Painting pictures on the window pane
Feelings my heart cannot explain
Oh the silence, sounds like music
Seems like I can hear a melody
Baby that's what you do to me

[Chorus:]
One thing I'm sure of
Whether it's wrong or it's right
I only want to be with you, tonight
And if you want me to
Baby ask me to stay
Heaven's just a whisper away

Feel the magic, taking over
Please don't stop before we lose control
Baby just let your feeling go
Soft and tender, like the morning
We get closer than we've ever been
We're almost to the rainbow's end

[Chorus]

I heard the winds of forever
Calling out my name
It's paradise, when I'm with you
I will never be the same

Please don't wake me if I'm dreaming
'cause this time, this one is coming true
So glad to share my dreams with you

[Chorus]

// Cry Of A Waking Heart //

I stand before you with my mind open wide
Waiting to receive whatever will be
The world the eyes survey is not the only world
For deep within the soul can be found all things

Like the shape of sound, the shape of wind
Like the shape of things when they first begin
How could I stop what I had to start
The cry of a waking heart

[Chorus:]
All I want is to love you
All I need is to get through
What I believe is a light in the dark
The crying of a waking heart

You shine inside me like the moon in the stream
And the waters flow around me

Like the colour of sun I cannot explain
Behind the familiar the view is strange
Maybe to love is to fly apart
And this emotion the cry of a waking heart

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Golden slumber
Now and forever
Truly rising
Imagine heaven
One vibration
This eternal thing

[Chorus 2x]

// Friends Unknown //

[Talk:]
I'm writing you this song
Cause I've always wanted to let you know
That no matter where you go
My love is with you

Long after the curtain falls
Its your I hear
Breaking down the walls
To let me know you're there

So sincerely
You've stood beside me
All through the years
Together we have grown
My friends unknown

Down on your knees your pray for me
Deep in my heart you'll stay
Eternally

You can turn my gray skies blue
There's just no me without you
For all the love you've shown
My friends unknown

[Bridge:]
This road may be long and winding
But no matter where it takes me to
I will always find my way
Back to you

[Talk:]
And you should know
That no matter where you go
I'm always there for you
I say a prayer for you
And I love you eternally

And if we never, never ever meet again
You'll always know where I stand
I'll never be alone
My friends unknown
For all the love you've shown
I wanna thank you
My friends unknown.

// Fred Astaire //

Romance me...dance me
'til I don't care
You haven't lived until you've danced on air
Whisper nothings if you dare
Won't you please, be my Fred Astaire

[Jam:]
Everybody up...everybody up
Everybody up on the dance floor now
Everybody up...everybody up
Everybody up on the dance floor now

I know they call you Mr. Lonely Heart
But you're the leading man to play the part
You don't have to be a millionaire
All you have to do is be my Fred Astaire

[Chorus:]
Get up now...get up now
Get up now...be my Fred Astaire [2x]

[Jam]

When you move it's like a melody
Serenading...the very heart of me

Swirl me. twirl me 'til I just can't
Take no more

Boy if you could only read my mind
You've been in my dreams a thousand time

[Jam]

// Say A Little Prayer //

Mr. Moonlight...shinebright
Show me my Mr. Right
Lights, camera, action
I wanna be his sole distraction

Cupid draw your bow
Shoot it nice and slow
Send it straight to his heart
Love don't let him go
You must let him know
This is love from the start

[Chorus:]
Say a little prayer
Say a little prayer for me tonight
Say a little prayer
Say a little prayer for my hear tonight

Mama always told me
(sometimes)
What you get is not what you see
I'm not taking any chances
No more broken romances

Cupid draw your bow fetch

[Chorus 2x]

I promise to always love and care for him
And I promise...to do my very best for him
I promise...to cherish him for all of my life

I promise...to always love and care for him
And I promise...I'll always be there for him
I promise...to love him for the rest of my life

[Chorus out]

// Mistaken Identity //

Undercover cop car
Came screeching to a halt
Body lying on the ground
Must be someone's fault
Circumstantial evidence
Seemed to point her way
Her right to remain silent
Was all she heard them say

Blue dress, blue eyes
Blonde hair, about five foot nine
Wrong place, wrong time
Wrong face, wrong crime

[Chorus:]
Mistaken identity
Could happen to you or to me
Mistaken identity
Mistaken identity
Could happen to you or to me
Mistaken identity
Mistaken identity

(I didn't do it, no, I didn't do it)

No money for a lawyer
To defend her case
Standing in the line-up
Tears rolling down her face

No one cared to listen
Someone had to take the heat
Sometimes there's no justice
When you're a victim of the street

Wrong place, wrong time
Wrong face, wrong crime [4x]

[Chorus]

Tu ut tu tu tu...tu ut tut tu tu

They didn't even say
I'm sorry
Tried to put her away
In a hurry

Don't make her pay the price
She's not guilty
(guilty)
For someone else's crime
Set her free
(set her free)

I didn't
I didn't
I didn't do it no [4x]

[Chorus out]

// What Is It You Want //

[Talk:]
You know what?
I think I'm gonna run for President
Well, I think I'm just gonna run
L think I'll run for President

[Chorus:]
(what is it you want?) [2x]

Everybody wants somebody sometime [2x]

[Jam:]
You say, you say, you say, you say you want love
You say, you say, you say, you say you want me
You say, you say, you say, you say you want money
You say, you say, you want to be free

Everybody wants somebody sometime
Everybody needs somebody sometime

[Chorus 2x]

[Talk:]
If I was a President you know what I'd do?
I'd say to all the people
What would I do for you?

[Chorus]

What is it you want?
What is it you need?
What is it you want?
What do you want from me?
Sometime...

Everybody wants somebody sometime [2x]

[Chorus]

What is it you want?
What is it you need? [2x]

[Talk:]
Is it money?
Yeahhhhh
Is it power?
Yeahhhhh
What about love?
Oooohhhh
A new car?
Yeahhhhh

[Talk:]
You know, if I was President
I'd ask all the people what they want
I'd try to find out what the people want

You can't get something for nothing [4x]

Everybody wants somebody sometime
Everybody wants somebody sometime

You can't get something for nothing [4x]

[Chorus]

Everybody wants somebody sometime
Everybody needs somebody sometime

[Talk:]
If your think you can get it for nothing
Well baby you're mistaken
'cause in this whole life
You can't get something for nothing, no, no
You can't get something for nothing...

// Let There Be Peace //

Someone let communication out the door
Someone decides it's worth fighting for
Why haven't we learned by what we've done before
Don't you know history's keeping score
And just once more
For every boy and every girl let there be love
All over the world
For everyone
Under the sun

[Chorus:]
Let there be peace on earth
Let every voice be heard

Le there be peace on earth
Brother to brother
'til it's felt around the world

There's only one world in which we all mus live
Heaven shoe us how to forgive
And on that marble wall which holds a million names
Generations of dreams gone down in flames
Isn't, isn't it a shame

For every boy and every girl
Under the sun...

[Chorus]

Let there be peace on earth
(why don't you try just a little harder)
Let every voice be heard
(my brother)
Let there be peace on earth
(oh, if we could just get it together)
'til it's felt around the world...

We're running out of time
As our leaders roll the dice
The human spirit cries
Its a precious, precious, precious...sacrifice.

[Chorus 2x]

Save the babies, save the babies
If we only get it together
If we could only get it together
I think we could make it
Think we could make it
Save the children...
Save the children...
