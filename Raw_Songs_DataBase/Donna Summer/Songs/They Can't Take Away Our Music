Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Don't let no one
No one get you down
'Cause if they do
If they do I'll be around

I want you near
Standing here by my side
So my dear wipe
Those tears from your eyes

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Don't let no one
No one get you down
'Cause if they do
If they do I'll be around

I want to see
You round me all the time
I want you to know that I am yours
And you are mines

Let nobody get you down
(Hey)
Let nobody get you down
Let nobody get you down

Let nobody get you down
Let nobody get you down
Let nobody get you down
(You keep me happy all the time)

Let nobody get you down
(You keep me happy, happy all the time)
Let nobody get you down
(You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you)
