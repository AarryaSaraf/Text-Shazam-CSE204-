Girlfriend can we talk
Well I have something to say
Girl when you're dealing with
Your man
There just ain't no easy way, no
Easy way

Woman treat that man real good
Woman like you know you should
God he made the woman
God he made the man
Knew just what he wanted in his
Master plan
Want your man to love you with all
His heart and soul
Let him be who he is
Let him take control

You're a woman and you got the
Right to be one
Let him know it
Let your life begin to show some

Woman treat that man real good
Woman like you know you should

Want him to be faithful
Love and understand
Want him to be kind
Be your lovin' man

Forget about the hard times
Think about the good
That's when he will treat you just
The way he should

You're a woman and you got the
Right to be one
Let him know it
Let your life begin to show some

Woman treat that man real good
Woman like you know you should

Woman treat that man real good
Woman like you know you should

You're a woman and you got the
Right to be one
You're a woman
You're a woman and you got the
Right to be one
You're a woman

Woman, woman, woman, woman
Woman, woman, woman, woman
