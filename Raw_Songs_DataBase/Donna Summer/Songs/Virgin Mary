Look at the lady with the crazy stare in her eyes
Looks way past fifty though she's barely thirty-five
Sleeps most days in the city park
Every night down at Casey's bar
And if she talks at all you'll hear her say
"I was a lovely girl in my younger days"

She was the prettiest girl this town had ever seen
But she dresses too gaudy for the likes of the people here
Out every night living life to the full
A string of men at her beck and call
But small-town people got small-town ways
And soon she was stuck with a brand new name

Hey Virgin Mary-lover of lovers
Hey Virgin Mary-how many others
Hey Virgin Mary-your bed is never empty
Hey Virgin Mary-it must bring you plenty

Oh that fateful night there was thunder in the air
The women were angry and the men felt like a share
A lynch mob frenzy came over the town
Grabbed hold of Mary, threw her down to the ground
The first man there that had Mary laid
Staggered back with shock on his face

Hey Virgin Mary-you're true to your name
Hey Virgin Mary-we've put you to shame
Hey Virgin Mary-you're not what we thought
Hey Virgin Mary-the victim of talk

Hey Virgin Mary, Hey Virgin Mary-rumour was your ruin
Hey Virgin Mary-evil talk was your undoing
Hey Virgin Mary-heavy on the conscience
Hey Virgin Mary-jealous talk and nonsense
Hey Virgin Mary-you were really like your name
Hey Virgin Mary-and we put you to shame
Hey Virgin Mary-you're not really what we thought
Hey Virgin Mary-jealous talk and nonsense
