When I was young
I used to dream of going far
Having my once, in a lifetime change
To prove I was a star.
A thousand times you stood
In the wings
Dreaming it was me,
I heard the people going wild
But it was just my fantasy

Life is a dance
And baby we're just players
So stand up and smile
And don't be afraid


This is my night
This is my song
Standing right here
Out on the stage
Is where I belong
This is my song
This is my night
Standing right here
Out on the stage
In the spotlight

I traveled the road
Wherever the road would lead
I made mistakes but I
Wouldn't quit
I made myself believe
Dreams come true
For those who dream
So one day you can say
The music be the fruit of life
And let the music play.

Life is a dance
And baby we're just players
So stand up and smile
And don't be afraid




This is my life
This is my life


This is my life
This is my life


This is my life
This is my life


This is my life
This is my life


This is my life
This is my life


This is my life
This is my life


This is my life
This is my life


This is my life
This is my life
