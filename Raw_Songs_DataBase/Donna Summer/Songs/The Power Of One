You must always remember

Life can be a challenge
Life can seem impossible
It's never easy
When so much
Is on the line
But you can make a difference
With courage
You can set things right
A gift to dream
And make dreams real
Is yours and mine

The power of one
Begins with believing
It starts in the heart
Then flows through the soul
And changes the world
Imagine how life will be
When we stand in unity
Each of us holds the key
To the power of one

Each of us is chosen
There's a mission just for you
Just look inside
You'd be surprised what you can do

The Power of one
Begins with believing
It starts in the heart
Then flows through the soul
And changes the world
Imagine how life will be
When we stand in unity
Each of us holds the key
To the power of one

One by one
We can make the world
A much better place

The power of one
Begins with believing
It start in the heart
Then flows through the soul
And changes the world
Imagine how life will be
When we stand in unity
Each of us holds a key
It's inside of you and me
Each of us holds the key
To the power of one

The power of one
