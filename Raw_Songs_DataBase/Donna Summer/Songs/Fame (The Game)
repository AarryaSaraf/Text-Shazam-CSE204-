You're fabulous
Fantastic
Now we have all the right property


Fame makes a fool out of anyone
Fame takes you back to the golden childhood
Fame makes you think that you're having fun
Fame the game

Turn your mobile on
Get off into the limousine
To the early morning show
Everyday routine
Make up fake up get a manicure
Five minute autographs, grab a picture, yes or no
All the same answers to the same questions
Create a scandal with your reaction
What's that you say
Take it or leave it
Paparazzi wanna see you bleeding



Late suit days, hair extensions
Botox faux false interventions
Nude job, boob job, all nouveau
It ain't what, but who you know
Uncalled perjury, cosmetic surgery
Dirty secrets frame your glory
It'll get the cover story



Everybody wanna be a star
It's all about who they think you are
Pulling up in a crazy car
The front door is your garage
Everywhere en entourage
Play like you've been living large
Someone got your credit cards
Lend me your blah blah blah

Be careful
Be careful what you wish for

Since I was a child of three
I'd watch old movies on the silver screen
Kate Bette and Marilyn were the reigning queens
(do you wanna be a star?)
I know if I can make it out
Out of this sleepy town then I could go real far
I could I'd really work so hard
And I could do it and do it and do it 'til I become a star



Miami, London, Paris in a week
Lying in private, catching up sleep
Celebrity parties, politic profits
Rock'n' roll bullyboys walk the red carpet
Getting in VIP through the velvet rope
Shake hands, photograph and you gotta go
Little black book pools with the CEO
Smile and tell'em what they wanna know
And tell'em what they wanna know

Be careful
Be careful what you wish for



Everybody wanna be a star
It's all about who they think you are
Pulling up in a crazy car
The front door is your garage
Everywhere an entourage
Play like you've been living large
Someone got your credit cards
Lend me your blah blah blah

You're fabulous! Fantastic!
