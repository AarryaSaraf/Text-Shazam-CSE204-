Ooh, something's coming over me
Ooh, I think it's got a hold on me, it's got me

Ooh, just the man I hoped you'd be
Ooh, just the man to set me free, you got me, you got me

Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And I'm hung up on you
Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And we got something new, oh yeah, me and you, oh baby

Ooh, guess I'm falling much too fast
Ooh, hope this love is gonna last, I've fallen

Ooh, the feeling's getting really strong
Ooh, you give me strength to carry on, I've fallen, I've fallen

Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And I'm hung up on you
Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And we got something new

Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And I'm hung up on you
Spring affair, spring affair, spring affair
And we got something new
Oh, baby...
