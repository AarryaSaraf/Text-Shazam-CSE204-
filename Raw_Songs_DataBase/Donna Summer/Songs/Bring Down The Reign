Voice of wood crying
Angel of joy, angel of joy
Angel of light

Tears were holding water
Crying for us all
Every son and every daughter
Rise up before we fall

Darfur, Darfur
The grace of God be with you
Waiting for arms of mercy
To surround us all

Voice of wood crying
Angel of joy, angel of joy
Angel of light
Open the doors heaven

Bring down the reign
Bring down the reign
Bring down the reign
Let me feel the wind again

One voice is like a choir
Singing sacred words
Break through all our resistance
Till it bends the Universe

Darfur, Darfur
The grace of God be with you
Waiting for arms of mercy
To surround us all

Voice of wood crying
Angel of joy, angel of joy
Angel of light
Open the doors heaven

Bring down the reign
Bring down the reign
Bring down the reign
Let me feel the wind again,
Oh let me feel the wind again...

To the broken heart
Of a wounded child
Covered with scars
Crying out loud

What will it take
To open your heart
Before his last breath
Before he departs

Bring down the reign
Bring down the reign
Bring down the reign
I said
Bring down the reign
Bring down the reign
Bring down the reign
Everybody 
Everybody 
Everybody 
Everybody 
Everybody
