And Gabriel appeared to Mary and said
"Do not be afraid Mary
You have found favor with God
You will be with child
And give birth to a son
And You are to give him the name Jesus
He will be great
And will be called the son of the most high
And the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David
And he will reign over the house of David forever
His kingdom will never end"

I have traveled many moonless night
Cold and weary with a babe inside
And I wonder what I've done
Holy father You have come
And chosen me now to carry Your son

I am waiting in a silent prayer
I am frightened by the load I bear
In a world as cold as stone
Must I walk this path alone
Be with me now
Be with me now

Breath of heaven
Hold me together
Be forever near me
Breath of heaven
Breath of heaven
Lighten my darkness
Pour over me Your holiness
For Your are holy
Breath of heaven

Do You wonder as You watch my face
If a wiser one should have had my place
But I offer all I am
For the mercy of Your plan
Help me strong
Help me be
Help me

Breath of heaven
Hold me together
Be forever near me
Breath of heaven
Breath of heaven
Lighten my darkness
Pour over me Your holiness
For You are holy

Breath of heaven
Hold me together
Be forever near me
Breath of heaven
Breath of heaven
Lighten my darkness
Pour over me Your holiness
For You are holy
Breath of heaven
Breath of heaven
Breath of heaven
