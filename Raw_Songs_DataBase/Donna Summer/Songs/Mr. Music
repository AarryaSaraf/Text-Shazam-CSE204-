I got my iPod, shake my body
You got my going, so naughty naughty
Hey Mr. Music, keep my focused
Keep me moving, like you promised
Take me back to another time
Play that track, come on press rewind

Hey Mr. Music come on rock me
Your so explosive, you really shock me
In my soul, under my skin
When its done, play it over again


I love music (I love it, I love it)
I love music (I love it, I love it)
I love music (I love it, I love it)
I love music (I love it, I love it)

Hey Mr. Music, you get me through it
You play it for me, know how to choose it
You make me happy, make me cry
You're always there in every part of my life

Hey Mr. Music come on and take me
You got me dreamin', shake me wake me
Never stop always in my mind
All day or night, mr overtime



I, need your help, get me through another day
Fridays been draggin' on, now I'm out

Time to play

Belly up belly up to the bar boy, let the money be seen
Belly up belly up to the bar boy, like a party machine
Belly up belly up to the bar boy, let the money be seen
Belly up belly up to the bar boy, like a party machine

I love music (I love it, I love it)
Wash rinse repeat
I love music
