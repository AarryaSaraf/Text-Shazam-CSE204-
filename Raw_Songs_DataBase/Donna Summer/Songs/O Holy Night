Oh holy night!
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of dear savior's birth!
Long lay the world in sin and error pruning
Till he appear'd and the soul felts its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night divine

Halleluiah for the holy night
