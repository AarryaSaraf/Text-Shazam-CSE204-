She walks into the room
And everybody knows
It's not a day too soon
She stands and strikes her pose
Yeah whohoa

She's back
Keep on saying that you wanna see her
Look in the mirror and you wanna be her
From the beginning it's a long career
Yes she's back, yes she's back

She's back
Keep on screaming that you want your diva
I've always told you that I'd never leave you
From the beginning it's a long career
Yes she's back yes she's back

I'm your friend I'm your lover
I'm your sister my dear brother
I'm your dear fairy godmother
Now you know your queen is back

Call the dj call the station
Dancing all across the nation
Here for every generation
Now you know your queen is back

So many years ago on the radio
She crept into your soul
And loved to love you oh oh

She's back
Keep on saying that you wanna see her
Look in the mirror and you wanna be her
From the beginning it's a long career
Yes she's back yes she's back

She's back
Keep on screaming that you want your diva
I've always told you that I'd never leave you
From the beginning it's a long career
Yes she's back, yes she's back

I'm your friend I'm your lover
I'm your sister my dear brother
I'm your dear fairy godmother
Now you know your queen is back

Call the dj call the station
Dancing all across the nation
Here for every generation
Now you know your queen is back
The queen is back

Keep on saying that you want me when you're all alone
Keep on saying that I make you feel like you belong
Keep on saying that you want your diva one on one
Keep on saying baby baby baby here I come
