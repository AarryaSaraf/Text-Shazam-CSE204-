I was stranded in the dark
Trying to find an open door
So alone

Chains were wrapped around my heart
Didn't know what love was for
No more
Heard these voices in my head
Telling me you'll never escape
No you can't get away

When the spirit in me said
Your love could show me the way
My whole life changed on that day

Now I'm walking in the light
All aglow
All I see is sunshine in my eyes
Skies of blue, it's true

I'm free
Out from under shadows
The only thing that matters
Is that you've worked a miracle in me
I'm free
Now when clouds surround me
They have no place around me
All because your love has set me free
I'm free

From the time that I knew
That I could find love in you
My heart's been renewed
Now all my dreams are coming true
I'm free

I was frightened in the cold
Desperate when you found me in time
You saved me from the world

Got my life back in control
Chased away the madness in my mind
You saved me right in time

Now my future's looking up
Skies of blue, all because of you
Got the sunshine in my life
All aglow, baby, don't you know

I'm free
Out from under shadows
The only thing that matters
Is that you've worked a miracle in me
I'm free
Now when clouds surround me
They have no place around me
All because your love has set me free
I'm free

From the time that I knew
That I could find love in you
My heart's been renewed
Now all my dreams are coming true
I'm free

I'm free
Out from under shadows
The only thing that matters
Is that you've worked a miracle in me
I'm free
Now when clouds surround me
They have no place around me
All because your love has set me free
I'm free
