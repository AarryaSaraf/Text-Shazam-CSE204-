Last night
We showed how much we cared
But sadness filled the air
How it made us cry
As we waved goodbye
Then you left me standing there

Last night
I came home on my own
And watched a movie show
And the saddest part
Really broke my heart
As it made me miss you so

I get so sentimental
Can't control the beat of my heart
I get so sentimental
Sentimental when we're apart

Last night
I tried to let you know
How it hurts to see you go
And how I want you near
Every time I hear
Our love song on the radio

I get so sentimental
Can't control the beat of my heart
I get so sentimental
Sentimental when we're apart

Can't control the beat of my heart
I get so sentimental
Sentimental when we're apart

How you made me cry
When we waved good bye
As it made me miss you so

I get so sentimental
Can't control the beat of my heart
I get so sentimental
Sentimental when we're apart

I get so sentimental

I get so sentimental
Sentimental when we're apart

I get so sentimental
Can't control the beat of my heart
I get so sentimental
