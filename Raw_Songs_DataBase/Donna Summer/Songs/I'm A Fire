I am a fire
Can't you feel the heat?
I am a furnace
Come burn in me
You are, you are, you are
The thing that makes me hotter
I need, I need your love
To make me warmer
I'm burning
I'm burning

Just like the sun reveals the sky
Just like a torch becomes you guide
I'm a fire
I'm a fire
And I'm burning so bright
Just like the moon
Heats up the night
Just like the star bursts into sight
I'm a fire
I'm a fire
And I'm burning so bright

I am a fire
Can you feel the heat?
I am desire
Come feel the beat
You are, you are, you are
The thing that makes me hotter
I need, I need your love
It makes me warmer
I'm burning
I'm burning

Just like the sun reveals the sky
Just like a torch becomes your guide
I'm a fire
I'm a fire
And I'm burning so bright
Just like the moon
Heats up the night
Just like the stars bursts into sight
I'm a fire
I'm a fire
And I'm burning so bright

You gave me everything I am
Came into my heart and tore it around
How could I know
You'd be the one
Honestly I am so taken

Believe in me and I in you
You're like water on my chocolate
You're like...
Can you feel it?
Do I need to say it?
Can't you just feel it?

Take your time
Let me feel it
Oooo babe oooo baby
Come on now



Que sera
Esta vida
Oh yo te quiero, yo te quiero, yo te quiero
Esta manana



Just like the sun reveals the sky
Just like the torch becomes your guide
I'm a fire
I'm a fire
Just like the moon
Heats up the night
Just like the star bursts into sight
I'm a fire
I'm a fire
And I'm burning so bright

I'm burning and I need you
I'm burning and I need you
I'm burning and I need you
