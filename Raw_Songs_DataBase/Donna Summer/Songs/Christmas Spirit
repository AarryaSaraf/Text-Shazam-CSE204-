Everyone, come gather near,
And I'll tell you a story, that you'll love to hear,
(ooohh)
It's Christmas time, the season's RIPE
And all around the world, we celebrate the birth of Christ.

He came to bring us peace,
He came to bring us everything that we need to set us free.
HOW I long to feel that Christmas spirit in my heart
Oh I long to feel that Christmas spirit in my heart

As a child I still recall
Well, Christmas was my favorite season of them all
(oh) my heart was filled with childlike grace
And THE hope there is in knowing
Why the savior came

He came to bring us peace
He came to bring us everything that we need
To set us free
Now I long to feel that Christmas spirit in my heart
Yes I long to feel that Christmas spirit in my heart

So turn your heart throbs in
And let God grow within
Not to destroy
The greatest gift I know
He came to earth below
To show us love

He came to bring us peace
He came to bring us joy
He came to bring us everything

IN faith, if we believe
The gift that we receive
Is life and love and everything

The greatest gift I know
He came to earth below
He came to bring us everything

Still I long to feel that Christmas spirit in my heart
Yes I long to feel that Christmas spirit in my heart
Now I long to feel that Christmas spirit in my heart
