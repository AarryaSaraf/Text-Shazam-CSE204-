Album: InTheHeart

// In The Heart //

Sing it from the mountain
Tell it to the people
Sing it from the mountain
Tell it to the people

When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
You should let them know it
When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it

You got this feeling you've been wanting to share
It makes you feel as though you're walking on air
You say this feeling needs a thing called love
Then you should tell the one you're thinking of

When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
You should let them know it
When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
It is time to show it

In every person, there's a yearning to love
This is the message that is sent from above
In every heart, there's a love so true
That's why I'm sayin' that I love you

When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
You should let them know it
When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
It is time to show it

You know that I love you
You say you love me too
So why don't you let me know
Let's open our hearts and let the feelings show

Sing it from the mountain
Tell it to the people
Sing it from the mountain
Tell it to the people

When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
You should let them know it
When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
It is time to show it

When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
You should let them know it
When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
It is time to show it

When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
You should let them know it
When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
It is time to show it

When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
You should let them know it
When you say you love somebody

// Joanna //

Joanna, I love you
You're the one, the one for me

I'm in love, and I won't lie
She's my girl and always on my mind
She gives me her love and a feeling that's right
Never lets me down, especially at night

So, I'm gonna do the best I can
To please that girl and be her only man, see
She cheers me up when I feel alone
And that's why baby I've got to let you know

Joanna, I love you
You're the one, the one for me, my baby

She's the one, the one for me
She's the kind of girl makes you feel nice, so
I'll try my best to do what's right
Take her for a ride, everything's fine

Joanna, I love you
You're the one, the one for me

Searched so far, searched so long
To find someone, someone to count on
Now I feel I've got it right here
Found it in you, baby, you, my dear

We can do all night, so nice
We'll have it all and everything will be alright
I'm promising you, take it from me
Take it home, baby take it home, baby

She's the one, the one for me
She's the kind of girl makes you feel nice, so
I'll try my best to do what's right
Take her for a ride, everything's fine

Oh Joanna
Oh Joanna

Joanna, I love you
You're the one, the one for me

Joanna, yes I love you, I love you
You're the one, the one for me
Believe me babe

// Tonight //

Tonight, ooh
This is the night you'll see the light
Tonight, ooh
This is the night you'll see the light

My 16th birthday I was so shy
Not yet a man but ready to try
Music playin', people swayin'
I looked around she caught my eye

Walked into the room I couldn't hardly see
There she was moving closer to me
She told me her name before I could speak
Took my hand and then she said these words to me

Tonight, ooh
This is the night you'll see the light
(That's what she said me)
Tonight, ooh
This is the night you'll see the light

Hey, beautiful girl so lovely tonight
Show me the way show me the light
Music playin', people swayin'
Next thing I knew we started to groove

Dancin' and dancin' moving so free
A feeling of love had come over me
I held her close and knew it was right
What a perfect surprise I had finally seen the light

Tonight, ooh
This is the night you'll see the light
(That's what she said me)
Tonight, ooh
(This is the night)
This is the night you'll see the light

Tonight, you will finally see the light
(Oh baby)
Tonight, you will finally see the light
(Oh baby)

Tonight, you will finally see the light
(You will see, ooh you will see the light)
Tonight you will finally see the light
(Ooh yeah)

Oh, come on, I want to dance with you
(Tonight, ooh)
(This is the night you'll see the light)

// Straight Ahead //

Straight ahead straight ahead
Let's go straight ahead to straight ahead
Straight ahead, come on straight ahead
Movin' straight ahead, straight ahead
Keep movin' straight ahead
Straight ahead

So you started from the bottom
But you always saw the light
And now you're ready for your journey
One direction reachin' high

Keep the feeling of the spirit
Always present as you climb
One direction, one vibration
That's the message let us try

Straight ahead, keep movin'
Movin' straight ahead, straight ahead
Keep movin' straight ahead

Keep the feeling of the spirit
Always present as you climb
One direction, one vibration
That's the message
You can make it if you try

Keep movin' straight ahead
Straight ahead
Movin' straight ahead
Keep movin' straight ahead in love
Let's go, let's go

Keep the spirit high
And your heart in love
Keep on movin'
Keep the spirit high
And your heart in love

Keep your head above
And your heart in love
Keep on movin'

Keep your head above
And your heart in love
Keep your feelings now
Keep moving straight ahead
Straight ahead, straight ahead
Keep moving straight ahead
