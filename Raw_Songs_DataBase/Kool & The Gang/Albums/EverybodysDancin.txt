// Big Chief Funkum //

Big Chief Funk no swing to nobody's thing
Funk is what we bring!

Get down, Big Chief, get down

Big Chief gets funky all the time
Funk stays on his mind
Funk is really fine
Big Chief says funk is in the mind
Funk is really not
A power to the prime

Some people really like to swing
When they do their thing
Thinkin' they're the king
Big Chief don't really like to swing
Swingin' ain't his thing
Funk is what he brings

I like funkin' with you, Chief
Can you show me how to funk it like you do

I like dancin' with you, Chief
Can you show me how to do it like you do
Do it, do it

Stop pullin' my feathers!

Big Chief stays funky all the time
If funkin' was a crime
We'd be doin' time
Big Chief says funk is what you feel
When it's really real
Doin' what you will

Some people really like to swing
When they do their thing
Thinkin' they're the king
Big Chief don't really like to swing
Swingin' ain't his thing
Funk is what he brings

I like funkin' with you, Chief
Can you show me how to funk it like you do

Get down, dance!
Get down, whoa-whoa-whoa, yeah
Get down, do it, do it
Get down, do it, do it

Hey, baby, where're you going
Love is here, don't act like you don't know
Don't let your heart grow cold
'Cause you will only lose, well
You've got to know by now, girl

Stay awhile with me
Won't you stay awhile with me
And let my love light your fire

Oh, boy, love is sweet and always mellow
I know it feels good to love
But I've been fooled before
You oughta know by now
That love don't come easy
So when we spend some time, oh

If I stay, don't be cruel
Don't you blow my mind
If I spend some time with you
If I stay, don't be cruel
Don't you blow my mind
If I spend some time with you
If I stay awhile, ooh...

Shoo-be-do-do, shoo-be-do-do
Oh, angel, I know you've been hurt before
Shoo-be-do-do-do
(That's all we need)
But life fills the sweetness and the sorrow
Shoo-be-do-do, shoo-be-do-do
(If you just stay awhile, stay awhile with me)
But just give this thing a chance and stay
Shoo-be-do-do-do
It's alright, girl, that's all
(Ooh-ooh-ooh...)

Stay with me
Won't you stay awhile with me
And let my love light your fire

Love is sweet and always mellow
I know it feels good to love, baby, baby
Don't it feel good to love, angel
Now, ooh...

Stay awhile with me
Won't you stay awhile with me
And let my love light your fire

Can't get enough of your love
Your love, stay awhile
Can't get enough of your love
Your love, stay awhile...
