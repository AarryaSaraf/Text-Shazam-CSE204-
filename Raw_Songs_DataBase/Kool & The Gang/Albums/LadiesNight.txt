// Got You Into My Life //

I open my eyes
And I finally realize
I got you in my life
And the loneliness dies

You brighten my days
In so many ways
I got you
I got you
I got you girl
I got you
I got you girl

You started these spark
That put love in my heart
With you in my life
All the loneliness passed

And you make me feel
So very real
I'm so glad I got you girl
I got you
I got you baby
Yeah yeah yeah

Never go away my sweet
It's your love I need
Stay here by my side
To love me and hold me and squeeze me
So 'til the end tonight

There was a time
When love was not mine
Though I searched everywhere
I just couldn't find
A love that was real, a love I could feel
So real...never go away...

Never go away my sweet
'Cause it's your love I need
Stay here by my side
To love me and hold me and squeeze me
Oh wee baby
To love me and hold me and squeeze me
To love me and hold me and squeeze me
So 'til the end tonight

There was a time
When love was not mine
I searched everywhere
But I just couldn't find
A love that was real, a love I could feel
So real...never go away...

You started this spark
That put love in my heart...yeah
With you in my life all the loneliness passed
And I wanna thank you baby
Fulfilling my life, yeah
Can't you feel me

Oh wee baby

Never go away...
Always..always..always..always..by my side
Because I feel it everyday feel it everyday

// Hangin' Out //

Let' go where the people go
That's where we want to be
Dancin' in the disco-light
Shine all over me

Music playing loud and clear
'Cause that's we, we want to hear
So let's go where they disco down
We'll rock and shake our bodies to the ground
Hangin' out, hangin' out

We're gonna rock and shake
Our bodies to the ground

Everybody hurry down
It's gonna be a night on the town
Sweet music will build the air
It's all about hangin' out
Got to see you there

You will move to the beat
In the disco heat
Hangin' out, everybody's coming

We're gonna rock and shake
Your bodies to the ground

Everybody hurry down
It's gonna be a night on the town
Sweet music will build the air
It's all about hangin' out
Got to see you there

Shake it down, baby
Did you get the news?
We ain't got no time to lose
Please don't hesitate
We don't wanna be late

Everybody hurry down
It's gonna be a night on the town
Sweet music will build the air
It's all about hangin' out
Got to see you there

Come on with your dancing shoes
We ain't got no time to lose
Come on with your disco-scats
We don't wanna be late, hangin' out

// Too Hot //

At seventeen we fell in love
High school sweethearts
Love was so brand new
We took the vows of man and wife
Forever, for life
I remember how we made our way
A little patience, the time we prayed
Can't imagine that this love is through
Feeling the pain, girl
When you lose

Oh, it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
What a mess we made
So long ago
You were my love
Oh, my love

Flyin' high we never took the time
To stop and feel the need
Funny how those years go by
Changing you, changing me
I remember love's fever
In our hearts, girl
And in our minds
Can't imagine that this love is through
Feeling the pain, girl
When you lose

Oh, it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
What a mess we made
So long ago
You were my love
Feeling the pain

[Instrumental Interlude]

Oh, it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
From this mess that we made

it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
So, so hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
Oh, gotta cool this mess we made
It's so, so hot, baby (too hot)
Yes, it's so hot
I can't take it
I can't stand no more, baby
We were once lovers (too hot)
We took our vows (too hot)
We're man and wife forever
Whoooooooooa (too hot)
Whoooooooooa
Baby (too hot)
Baby, please won't you listen (too hot)...
