// Dave //

Dave, save our humanity
'Cause only you can see tale of our history
Dave, save our humanity
'Cause only you can see tale of our history

So out of control
When truth is told
Nobody knows

Dave, save our humanity
'Cause only you can see tale of our history
Dave, save our humanity
Are we the enemy spreading insanity?

So out of control
When truth is told
Nobody knows, Dave

See us from the skies above
Man was born only to love
Right our wrongs to God above
All are one, not them or us

Teach a lesson hard to learn
Precious gifts cannot be earned
In our hearts the seed of trust
Torn away by greed and lust

Let the children go where the wild winds blow
Leave our seeds to grow, brave new world to know
Only love will sow, only peace can grow
Let the children go, save the children

Let the children go where the wild winds blow
Leave our seeds to grow, brave new world to know
Only love will sow, only peace can grow
Let the children go, save the children

Save the children, save the children
Save the children, save the children
Save the children, save the children
Save the children, save the children, save the children

// Steppin' Into Love //

Tonight, tonight, tonight

What a lovely feeling, music so appealing
Steppin' into love, my baby and I
When we start the dancin', we begin romancin'
Steppin' into love, my baby and I

Steppin' into love tonight
Steppin' to the love

Music is so thrilling and she is so willing
Steppin' into love, my baby and I
Every beat's a love song, nothing here can go wrong
Steppin' into love, my baby and I

Steppin' into love tonight
Steppin' to the love

Every night we go out and dance
There's a chance to increase romance
And we know every beat is love
Steppin' into love
Steppin' into love

Every night we go out and dance
There's a chance to increase romance
And we know every beat is love
Steppin' into love
Tonight, tonight, tonight

The beat is gettin' stronger, we dance a little longer
Steppin' into love, my baby and I
Steppin' in a small way, says I love her always
Steppin' into love, my baby and I

Steppin' into love tonight
Steppin' into the love, whoa, tonight

Every night we go out and dance
There's a chance to increase romance

And we know every beat is love
Steppin' to love
Tonight, tonight, tonight, all night

// America //

America
America
America
America

[?] saw a light and she promised her child
To carry him through and give birth on that side
In a dingy hotel on the north of the line
She gave birth to a boy and went into the lie

High in the skies, stars are pointing their light
To a place on the map we are dying to find
There's a bill on the books from the ancestor's law
It is written in code yet it speaks to us all

America
Some say that it's physical
Some say that it's spiritual
Some say it's a miracle, oh, so beautiful
(America)

Some say that it's physical
Some say that it's spiritual
Some say it's a miracle, oh, so beautiful

A young man had won from the hounds and the guns
They had a built up this world from the sweat of his brow
Now he dreamed of his seed growing strong over time
No child of his will live south of the line

Eagle told men when he showed at the shore
That a promise was written and sealed in her core
I can tell you no more then this land is alive
You can call it your own but you can't own a lie

America
Some say that it's physical
Some say that it's spiritual
Some say it's a miracle, oh, so beautiful
(America)

Some say that it's physical
Some say that it's spiritual
Some say it's a miracle, oh, so beautiful
(America)

America
America
America
America
America

Some say that it's physical
Some say that it's spiritual
Some say it's a miracle, oh, so beautiful

America, my life
I want the whole world to know the reason why
I want to live, not die
I want the whole world to know the reason why
America, oh, so beautiful

// What's Happening //

Tell me what's goin' on
What's poppin', baby?
What's crackin'?
What's happening?
Tell me what's goin' on

What's poppin', baby?
What's crackin', baby?
What's happening?
Tell me what's goin' on

Hey baby, what you no good
I'm just gettin' back, but you knew I would
War is hell, when will it end?
When will people start gettin' together again?

Are things really gettin' better
Like the newspaper say?
What else is new my friend
Besides, what I've read?

Can't find no work
Can't find no job, my friend
Money is tighter than it's ever been
Say man, I just don't understand

What's goin' on?
What's poppin'?
Yeah, what's crackin'?
I wanna know what it is
What's happening?
Yeah, what's happening, brother?

// Is What It Is //

It ain't happening
It ain't happening

It ain't happening
So brother take your finger off the trigger
Wrong, wrong, wrong

It ain't happening
So women stop callin' each other
Wrong, wrong, wrong

It ain't happening
'Cause people still keep callin' them self
Wrong, wrong

We will never learn a lesson
So it keeps on comin' back
As a matter of fact
It is what it is and it is what it is

We will never learn a lesson
So it keeps on comin' back
As a matter of fact
It is what it is and it is what it is

We will never learn a lesson
So it keeps on comin' back
As a matter of fact
It is what it is

It is what it is and it is what it is
It is what it is and it is what it is

As a matter of fact
It is what it is and it is what it is
As a matter of fact
It is what it is and it is what it is
It is what it is and it is what it is

As a matter of fact
It is what it is and it is what it is
We will never learn a lesson
So it keeps on comin' back

// Everything's Gonna Change //

Can't say I've seen it all
There's always a lesson to learn
Life's gonna change, win or loose
Every season must have its turn

Oh, look around and life just ain't the same
Search for reasons that you can't explain
When you think what's the use
What was said to me, I'll will say to you

Sometimes it rains, you feel some pain
But one thing is true, gray skies will turn to blue
With each new day one thing will stay the same
Everything, everything's gonna change

You know you find yourself wondering
Would the grass have been greener time and again
'Coz your circumstance keeps bringing you down
Over and over again

Oh, you search for reason that you can't explain
You look around but life just ain't the same
When you think what's the use
Remember what I'm telling you

Sometimes it rains, try to understand
But one thing is true, gray skies will turn to blue
With each new day one thing will stay the same
Everything, everything's, everything

Sometimes it rains, you feel some pain
But one thing is true, gray skies will turn to blue
With each new day one thing will stay the same
Everything, everything's gonna change

Please just try to understand
When life doesn't go as planned
This one thing that makes one change
Everything, everything, everything

Sometimes it rains, you feel some pain
But one thing is true, gray skies will turn to blue
With each new day one thing will stay the same
Everything, everything's gonna change

Sometimes it rains, you feel some pain
But one thing is true, gray skies will turn to blue
With each new day one thing will stay the same
Everything, everything's

Sometimes it rains, hey [?] blue
Everything, everything's gonna change, baby

// Too Low For Zero //

People need people

Just yesterday our nations became as one
To save those countless victims a way
Still the east is full of bombs that blast away
And children lose their innocence their heart to pray

Heroes come and heroes go, they save the day
But who will come and wash their tears away
Seems like Heaven cries all day
Still too low for zero, Heaven feels the pain

Too low for zero, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows, too low

Yes, it seems like Heaven is ten zillion miles away
When we go through earthly war, nature's ??
Still I know that God loves each and every soul
The children of the one eternal flame

Skin of bronze, hair like ?? you turn away
The color of the skin still the judge
Christian, Muslim, Jew and Buddhist, they live and pray
Forgive 'em Father, they know not what they do this day

Too low for zero, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows, too low

Hold on to your faith
Oh, as the world spins around
Just believe even though
That you're, you're below zero

Too low for zero, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows
Too low for zero, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows

Too low for zero, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows
Too low for zero, too low

Too low for zero, Heaven knows, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows, too low

// Made For Love //

I thank the Lord that I've got you
Girl, you know you've always been the strength of me
Got my back when I'm down
Keep my head off the ground

Never messed around, didn't never change
Kept my love when I was going through some things
Now the years have gone by and I'm sure
'Coz you're still right here, now I know

I was made for love
You were made for me
We were made for us
You're the only one I need

'Coz I was made to love you
You were made for me
We were made for us
I'm the only one you need 'coz I need you

Can I take time out to express myself?
I don't wanna be with no one else, no
Does it matter what you cannot do?
'Coz if I got it, girl, you know you got it too

You can rest assure, you got my support
If you really hurting, lean on me, I'll lift you up
It's whatchu done for me, is how I feel
I would give my life and then [Incomprehensible]

I was made for love
You were made for me
We were made for us
You're the only one I need

'Coz I was made to love you
You were made for me
We were made for us
I'm the only one you need 'coz I need you

Listen baby, temptations come, temptations go
You're the one I wanna know
Baby, you're my thick and thin
You're my now, baby, you're my then

You can rest assure 'bout us
'Coz in that I trust
That we'll be together
Always so in love

When I'm away from you
You're still right there with me
Always in my heart
Girl, you're one with me

Play with your love
I'm only playing myself
We were meant for each other
Girl, there's no one else

I was made for love
You were made for me
We were made for us
You're the only one I need

'Coz I was made to love you
You were made for me
We were made for us

// Trust Me //

Oh, I want a special love in my life, that trust in me
We sendin' this one out to all those lovers
Who have someone who can trust
The special love in your love, yeah

Oh, this thing called love is easy to say
Not so hard to do, many games that we play
Just like Monopoly, ooh, you rolled the dice
Probably [Incomprehensible] chance
Chance you take, pray it's right

Like your best friend, oh, the confidante
Want a special love to love you like your mama
I found a special love, special love in you
And I want you to believe in me like I believe in you

Trust me like I trust in you, yeah
And I wanna spend my life with you, baby
Girl, I got trust in you, yeah

Even when I'm away from home
Just trust me, if you call, I'm gon' find my way to you
Ain't nothin' but the best of me for my girl
Even through those hard times, our love comes shinin' through

I played my share of games before I met you
That time has passed away, but we're just someone new
[Incomprehensible] in no one else when things ain't goin' right
Without you by my side, I just can't sleep at night

Oh, trust me like I trust in you, yeah
And I wanna spend my life with you, baby
Girl, I got trust in you, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah

Every time I think of you leaving me
I get so shook up to drive me on my edge
And if you put your trust in me, I won't let you down
I bet you got that, our destiny is you and I

Let the record show, not wrecks to flow
You might catch me anywhere, private jet, you go
You already know I got another show
Then after the show I'm back home to you
Back home to you, back home to you, you feel me?

Trust me, I'll be waitin' on you
'Coz you complete the things that I do
Even when you come, I'm by side
Don't worry 'bout nothin', I'll be alright
I'll be waitin' on you, all you have to do is just trust me

Trust me just like I trust in you, yeah
I wanna spend my life with you, baby
Just like I trust in you, girl

Trust in me, baby, keep on lovin' me
Trust in me, like I believe in you
Trust in me, baby
I don't wanna live without you, how do I?
Just trust me

// Miracles //

Gideon and his baby brother
Caught up in some wild course fire
Tossed a peaceful cradle
September war had come to call

And Gideon carried his baby brother
Checked a thousand miles or more
Faced the hungry lions, angry guns were crying
Handful of containment gone
And I believe, I believe

I believe in miracles
Believers don't ask why
Child is made from miracles
And there's a reason why
I believe

Three thousand little boys were [?]
A miracle that they survived
Ancestors, they kept them, mother don't forget the
Weak that had to march or die

Today the weary cry for mercy
Tomorrow's wars already come
The healing of the lands held in tiny hands
And comes the earth with each new child
And I believe, I believe

I believe in miracles
Believers don't ask why
Child is made from miracles
And there's a reason why

Now miracles, they live among us
We see their faces everyday
When brothers smile from pain, mothers tears refrain
The miracle of hope survives
And I believe, I believe

I believe in miracles
Believers don't ask why
Child is made from miracles
And there's a reason why

I believe in miracles
Believers don't ask why
Child is made from miracles
And there's a reason why

You believe in miracle, miracle

// Livin' In The 21 //

Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
You gotta try to find the love

I know there's a power
That lifts us high and higher
I believe in mankind
What divides us is just a change of mind

My friends came home from war today
Sad to listen to words they had to say
They saw humanity go astray
If it wasn't for the faith, we wouldn't be here today

Whole time the world spins around
These are the days, the days of our lives
Gotta have a little faith livin' in the 21
Gotta have a little faith livin' in the 21

Maybe your body only knows pain
Maybe your hearts' been broken again
Lost your job in buyin' necessities
Inside you're screamin', 'I got to be free'

You know there's a power
That lifts us high and higher
Deep in your heart, down in your soul
Have a little faith and then let it flow

Whole time the world spins around
These are the days, the days of our lives
Gotta have a little faith livin' in the 21
Gotta have a little faith livin' in the 21

Gotta keep the faith, you can't give in
Gotta run this race and gotta try to win
Gotta hold your head up and smile again
Thank God for all your family and friends

And when it gets rough and when it gets tough
Hold your head up, you gotta try to find the love
Can't take the pain that this world brings
Sometimes you feel like you wanna scream

Step fast, now move on, you gotta pray
When time get hard, you can't stray away
Stay focused, you gotta try to reach your goal
Many troubles and trials gonna be down that road

Listen to the signs, gotta keep a clear mind
Livin' in the 21, you stay on your grind
Hold tight 'coz you know this world gon' spin
But you come out on top, you know you will win

Whole time the world spins around
These are the days, the days of our lives
Gotta have a little faith livin' in the 21
Gotta have a little faith livin' in the 21

Whole time the world spins around
These are the days, the days of our lives
Gotta have a little faith livin' in the 21
Gotta have a little faith livin' in the 21

Livin' in the 21
Livin' in the 21
We gotta have faith today

Keep your mind on exactly what you do
Don't let nobody mess up what you do
Hold tight in exactly what you do
Keep livin' good and doin' what you do

Have faith 'coz we livin' in the 21
Stand tall 'coz we livin' in the 21
Father, help us 'coz we livin' in the 21
Can?t cry no more 'coz we livin' in the 21

When you think you done it all, you just gotta stand
Anything you wanna do, I'm tellin' you bet you can
Complete your dreams and do the master plans
When you think you done it all, you just gotta stand

Have faith 'coz we livin' in the 21
Stand tall 'coz we livin' in the 21
Father, help us 'coz we livin' in the 21
Can?t cry no more 'coz we livin' in the 21

// Sorry //

I'm so sorry
You want me back?
I never meant to hurt you, baby
You want me back?
Oh, I'm so sorry

Fame changed the game for us
It's a shame 'coz our love just couldn't remain the same
Couldn't last because of what we had in common
Reachin' for the stars, tryin' to run this game

In my mind, you're still all mine
In my heart, you're never left behind
I still see the way you walked out that door
With those tears in your eyes
I replay it a thousand times

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I'm sorry for the night I've been astray

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I'm sorry for the night I've been astray

Didn't see until it was too late
And what we had was so special, baby
Now I realized that all I have
Really means nothin' without you by my side

But in my mind, you're still all mine
And in my heart, you're never left behind
I still see the way you walked out that door
With those tears in your eyes
I replay it a thousand times

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I'm sorry for the night I've been astray

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I'm sorry for the night I've been astray

Oh, this pain I feel
Coincide with you not here
Now and then that I see it so clear
I wanna say I miss you, my dear

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I'm sorry for the night I've been astray

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I'm sorry for the night I've been astray

To make my rainy days go away
I'm sorry for the night I've been astray

To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I'm sorry for the night I've been astray

So sorry, babe, so sorry, babe
'Coz I need you, need you in my life, my life
So sorry, babe, so sorry, so sorry, so sorry
I never meant to hurt you, sorry, babe, i need you, babe
I love you, baby, I want you, baby

// Someone Like You //

I was born in Memphis, she grew up in Jersey
Unlikely pair to ever fall in love
She has good education, strong determination
I learned my lessons on the road

I watch her as she's sleeping, kiss her gently seeing
Her smile, then she falls back to her dreams
Guess I'll walk to the bakery, buy her favorite pastry
You know the woman treats me well

I've had other relations, love situations
They ended inside out, upside down
I've cried tears when lonely, no one to hold me
Hey love, can you hear me call?

You know love, I'm so proud
Whatever you want is yours 'coz girl you've got my heart
When it was rain outside you sheltered me from the storm
Hello God above, thank you for true love

He said, someone like you
(Someone like you)
Will miss me for, will miss me for, will miss me forever
(Someone like you)

And he said, someone like you
(Someone like you)
Will miss me for, will miss me for, will miss me forever
(Someone like you)

We were married quietly on a beach in Cali'
The wind blew gently through your hair
Pastor Avery gave the vows there
Friends and family smiled there
Hey love, you know we will be happy

I live my life as a sensitive man
Wore my heart out on my sleeve
And every love in my life would use me up then leave
Hey love, you heard me call

You know love, I'm so proud
Whatever you need is yours, oh yeah
When it was rain outside you sheltered me from the storm
And hello God above, I thank you for true love

And he said, someone like you
(Someone like you)
And he said, someone like you
(Will miss me for, will miss me for, will miss me forever)
(Someone like you)

(Someone like you)
And he said, someone like you, yeah
(Will miss me for, will miss me for, will miss me forever)
(Someone like you)

(Someone like you)
Someone, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Someone like you)
I love you, I love you baby, someone like you
(Someone like you)

Whatever you want, it's yours
(Someone like you)
Whatever you need, it's yours baby
'Coz I love you, yeah, I love you
