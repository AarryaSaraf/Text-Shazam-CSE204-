// Good Times //

Are you ready?

Whoo!
Oh, yeah!
What's happenin' man?
Good times are on my mind
School is out, summertime!

Good times on my mind
Good times on my mind
Good times on my mind
Good times on my mind

Good times are on my mind
School is out in the summertime
They're chasing time for the workin' man
People on the beach and playin' in the sand
Ow!

Good times on my mind
Get down!
Get it up!
What you say?

Groovy!
Do, do, do, do!
Yeah!

People catchin' trains and on their way
Buses and trains, and whatever you say, baby
The sun is shinin' its radiant light
The moon is out for the lovers tonight
Oh, yeah!
Whoo!

Get down!
Get on down!

Whoo!

Yeah
Do it!

Do it!
Do it, do it!
(Good times on my mind)
Do it!
Do it, do it!
Do it!
Do it, do it!
Do it!
Do it, do it!
Do it!
Do it, do it!

Do it, do it!
Do it, do it!
Do it!
Do it, do it, yeah!
Do it, do it!
Do it, do it!
Do it, do it!
Do it, do it!

Come on
Oh, yeah!
Whoo, come on

Think about the good times, yeah
Think about the good times
Think about the good times, yeah...

// Wild Is Love //

Wild is love
It is everything you feel inside
Like an early spring
That takes away the chill
And leaves a warmth inside

Sitting in my chair
With my head between my hands
Thinking of you and me
How happy we will be
Loving you today
Was all I wanted anyway
We can be happy, girl, together

Wild is love
It is everything you feel inside
Like an early spring
That takes away the chill
And leaves a warmth inside

Sitting in my chair
With my head between my hands
Thinking of you and me
How happy we will be
Loving you today
Was all I wanted anyway
We can be happy, girl, together

Loving you is all that I desire
You in every dream I dream
Loving you is all that I desire
You in every dream I dream, mm-hmm...

// Father, Father //

Father, where's the love I thought there would be?
Where's the happiness in me?
Is life just an endless walk to nowhere?
With streets that just lead to dead ends?
Where parents water their flowers with hate
And children do the same
But who's to blame?
Spring?
No, it's just a gentle thing
But man flies around the moon and sings a song that stars with June
And eats his lunch at every moon
In harmony he does this
But with love, is out of tune

Father, father, father, you were surely right
If the world should end tomorrow
It would be by man's own might
Lord have mercy on us
Seems to be a favorite line
Wherever we're down or in trouble
Or blocks to eternal divine

Father, there's war and worry
Lord, there's hurt and sorrow
And won't you live to see tomorrow

Father, father, father, what can we do what's right
Lord, please smile upon us
Give us your guiding light

What can we do what's right
Lord, please smile upon us
Give us your guiding light

Father, where's the love I thought there would be?
Where's the happiness in me?

Lord, you know, I know you know, father
