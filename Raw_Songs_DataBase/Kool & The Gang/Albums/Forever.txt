Album: Forever

// Victory //

People, get ready
It's time to show what you got
Players, take your places
There's only one way to the top

You must feel that victory, release that energy
And ride like the wind
With fire in your eyes, shake those butterflies
And do the best that you can

Victory (Sweet) Victory
Let the party begin, uh-huh
Victory (Sweet) Victory
Let's do it again

You are the best
You seem to stand out from the rest
Ooh, your intentions
To be more than an honorable mention

You must feel that victory, release that energy
And ride like the wind
With fire in your eyes, shake those butterflies
Go ahead, and go for the win, now

Victory, victory
Let the party begin, uh-huh
Victory, (Sweet) Victory
Everybody can win

'Cause it's the same way in life (Same way in life)
Inside the tunnel, see the light
Perfect balance, you must find
It's the same way in life

Victory, victory, victory

(Victory is sweet, ooh-ooh)
(Victory is sweet)
(Victory is sweet) Oh, can you feel it?
(Victory is sweet) So sweet, so sweet

There's only one way to the top
If you really want it, you can never stop pushin'
For the victory, go ahead, go ahead
Players, take your places
Go ahead

Yeah, feel that victory, release that energy
Yeah
So sweet to the top
Go ahead
Go ahead

Players, take your places
To the top
Victory, go ahead

Victory is sweet, victory
Let's do it again
Victory (Sweet) Victory
Let the party begin

// I.B.M.C. //

Everybody, please rise
It's rhythm music time
Open up the door and spread the word
Round the sheeps in the meadow
The captains on the throne
This quiet place they call home
That's where they're making rhythm music
All night long, yeah
Spread the word, uh!

Down at Central Street Park
Everybody's chilling
Looking for excitement and romance, well
Everybody gather 'round
We want to rock this town
Just listen to the beat
It's a real fine beat
It's an I.B.M.C. treat
Oh, making rhythm music all night long, yeah
Spread the word, uh!

Itty Bitty MIDI Committee
Making music for the world
Itty Bitty MIDI Committee, ooh...
Making music for the world
I.B.M.C

When your body starts to shake
Hungry for a taste of the rhythm
Just listen to me, don't call the doctor
'Cause she can't help you
You need a cure and we've got the beat
It's I.B.M.C. music, ow!

Where music can be found, yeah

Itty Bitty MIDI Committee, ooh...
Making music for the world
Spread the word!
Itty Bitty MIDI Committee, ooh...
Making music for the world, ooh...

Itty Bitty MIDI Committee, ooh...
Making music for the world
Spread the word!
Itty Bitty MIDI Committee
Making music for the world

MIDI
Making music for the world
Spread the word!
Itty Bitty MIDI Committee
Making music for the world...

// Stone Love //

Girl, the first time we met
You took me by surprise
Ooh, girl you walked into my life
With those street corner blues
You were livin' in the fast lane
Much to my surprise baby
But I fell for you anyway
I'm addicted to your love, girl

Hey, stone love
Solid as a rock
I'm in love with you, baby
Stone love
Ooh, solid as a rock

Girl, our love is so unique
It's one of a kind
And girl, whenever we kiss
Its like a natural high
But we're livin' in the fast lane
Red lights flashin', baby
Will we ever change the way we are?
Stone love, girl

Oh, stone love
Solid as a rock
Stone love
Ooh, solid as a rock

The life we live is a challenge, mhmm
Always standin' on the edge
May not be the best way
But that's all we know
'Cause I don't wanna live my life alone, no

Oh, stone love, baby
I got you
Yes, I've got you
Got you under my skin
Yeah, yeah

Stone love
Oh, solid as a rock
That's the way we are, baby
Stone love
(Together, forever)
Ooh, solid as a rock
(Let me hold ya in my arms)
Stone love
(Woo, stone love)
Solid as a rock
(Ooh, baby)

May not be the best way
But that's all we know
'Cause I don't wanna live my life alone, no

This is the endin'

// Forever //

Now I only want to love you
If you are my dream, my dream come true
To have you here in my life
Would ease the grief and strife
For you my love will never end
Don't hesitate to let it in
Just let my love caress your heart
And we'll never part

Each day in love together
Won't be like any other
Our nights will last a little longer
With you I'm so much stronger, mm-hmm
I'll whisper gently in your ear
And ease away your every fear
It's our own little world
Let's keep it alive

Forever you, forever me, forever love
Forever you, forever me, forever love

Through the years we have held the greatest love
One that's so wonderful, so rare
I don't think that I could love this way again
Lady, should we let it end, this love affair

Forever you, forever me, forever love
Forever you, forever me, forever love

With time to guide us through the years
We both will see
Love can last eternally, if we let it be
Let's hold each other ever so tenderly
In perfect harmony, forever

Forever you, forever me, forever love
Forever you, forever me, forever love

Let's do it for love
Forever you, forever me, forever love
Forever you, forever me, forever love

Let's do it for love
Forever you, forever me, forever love
Forever you, forever me, forever love...

// Holiday //

Summer fun, work is over
Let your hair down, invade the beach town
Crystal Lake where we like to play
Me and my baby, oh, our private getaway
One on one, rockin' in the sun
Relaxation, our vacation
Smiling faces when the children play
Well, it's so wonderful to have a holiday

Ooh, those holidays
We'll be dancin', lovin', romancin'
Time to celebrate those holidays

All it needs, cool breezes
Night is falling, romance is calling
Winter snow, tender season
Fire's burning, spiritual learning
Top of the year, we all give a cheer
Horns blowing, tears are flowing
Spring fever, love is here to stay
And it's so wonderful to have a holiday

Ooh, those holidays
We'll be dancin'
Lovin', romancin'
Time to celebrate those holidays

Holiday, time to play
Holiday fun
Holiday, let's celebrate
Holiday fun

Time flies when you're having lots of fun
Before you know it, you're back on the run
So let's rejoice and let's give a cheer
This holiday, whoo, whoo, whoo!

Holiday, time to play
Holiday fun
Holiday, let's celebrate
Holiday fun

Whoo, whoo, whoo!

Holiday
Holiday
Holiday, holiday
Holiday, holiday

Holiday, time to play
Holiday fun
Holiday, let's celebrate
Holiday fun...

// Peacemaker //

Spinning 'round in your dance of life like a hurricane
'Round and 'round we search for love in a world gone insane
Where's the Joy? Where's the laughter? Have we all gone astray?
Hold on tight, don't give up for love is on the way

What we need, is a peacemaker
What we need, is a hero for the world
What we need, is a peacemaker
This old world is calling out man, woman, child

There must be someone
Somewhere to show the beauty and the power of love
Could be you, could be me that someone from all nations
Come together, our world as one for we are the hero generation

What we need, is a peacemaker
What we need, is a mighty mountain of love
What we need, is a peacemaker
Hearts will praise that precious beauty

When the time has finally come, this song of love
These words of light will help, lift you towards the sun
We bring peacemaker, peacemaker, mighty mountain of love
Peacemaker, peacemaker, hero for the world

What we need, is a peacemaker
What we need, is a mighty mountain of love
What we need, is a peacemaker, a mountain of love
What we need, is a peacemaker, peacemaker
What we need, is a peacemaker, peacemaker
What we need, is a peacemaker, a mountain of love

// Broadway //

In the beginning, every thing was new
City lights, those subway sounds
I was a young blood, fell in love with you
You looked so beautiful

At the matinee, on Broadway
She threw a kiss my way, Broadway
I fell in love, Broadway
Fell in love with the leading lady, yeah

Anticipation, ran within my mind
Butterflies were flying high
After the encore, would this be the time
That love would bring us together

But when the curtain fell on Broadway
The theater was an empty shell, Broadway
Tell me, where did she go, on Broadway
Guess I'll never know, I'll never, never know

So, baby, take it to the stage so we can dance
You and I, a virgin romance
Take it to the stage where love began
My imagination, let's make pretend
I fell in love, ooh-ooh...

Well, she stole my heart
And I was so young and I didn't understand it
But I waited and I waited and I waited
To see, was she a widow, or out and come around to marry, yeah

Oh, yeah
(Broadway)
Anticipation run in on my mind
(Broadway)
What a weight on my mind, my mind
Broadway
On Broadway, Broadway

// Special Way //

Here we are
Back in love again
This time unlike before
You and I
Giving so much more
Learning what it means
To really love someone
To trust in love

Sharing life as one
In a special way

Time be still
Listen to my heart
It's beating strong and clear
And so fast
Yes, it's love, you know
Filling empty days
That now seem so long ago
We found love

Trusting in each other
In a special way
(In a special way)
Oh oh
Yes, I wanna love you
More and more each day
In a special way

I know miracles
Do come true
The moment
I laid my eyes on you
(So beautiful)
That love has shown us
That special way
To love
To hold each other
In a special way
(Special way)

(So beautiful)
To love
To hold each other

Oh
Yes, I wanna love you
More and more each day
In a special way

Oh
Yes, I wanna love you
More and more each day
In a special way

Oh
Yes, I wanna love you
More and more each day
In a special way

// God's Country //

Ooh-ooh-ooh...
Yeah, yeah, you

Traveling, ooh, traveling, traveling
Traveling, ooh, traveling, traveling
Over God's country

We have been blessed with one more tomorrow
To make our dreams come true
So let's take this time before life passes by
To make real our fantasies

There's a place I love and often dreamed of
Like a painted picture, it's so beautiful
Late at night when all the stars are shining
It's so lovely to see, would you like to go with me

Traveling over God's country
You and me
Traveling me and you, together
Traveling over God's country
(Whoa-whoa...)

You always wanted to fly like the wind
To a place where we first began
So, to the east in the morning light
We'll ride into paradise

Traveling over God's country
(Traveling, ooh, traveling, traveling)
You and me
Traveling, you and me
(Traveling, ooh, traveling)
Traveling over God's country
You and me
(Traveling over God's country)

Love is our guide as we take to the sky
To the land of majesty
There's love everywhere because people do care
What a lovely sight to see

God's country
To the land of milk and honey
(What can you do)
God's country
There you're sure to find
(How good to know for more time)

Traveling, ooh, traveling, traveling
Traveling, ooh, traveling, traveling
Over God's country

To the east in the morning light
We'll ride into paradise, paradise

Traveling over God's country
You and me
Traveling, you and me
Traveling over God's country
You and me
Over God's country

Traveling over God's country
You and me
Traveling, you and me
Traveling over God's country
You and me
Over God's country...
