It ain't happening
It ain't happening

It ain't happening
So brother take your finger off the trigger
Wrong, wrong, wrong

It ain't happening
So women stop callin' each other
Wrong, wrong, wrong

It ain't happening
'Cause people still keep callin' them self
Wrong, wrong

We will never learn a lesson
So it keeps on comin' back
As a matter of fact
It is what it is and it is what it is

We will never learn a lesson
So it keeps on comin' back
As a matter of fact
It is what it is and it is what it is

We will never learn a lesson
So it keeps on comin' back
As a matter of fact
It is what it is

It is what it is and it is what it is
It is what it is and it is what it is

As a matter of fact
It is what it is and it is what it is
As a matter of fact
It is what it is and it is what it is
It is what it is and it is what it is

As a matter of fact
It is what it is and it is what it is
We will never learn a lesson
So it keeps on comin' back
