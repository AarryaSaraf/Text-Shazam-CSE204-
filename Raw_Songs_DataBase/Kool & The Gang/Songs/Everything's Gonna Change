Can't say I've seen it all
There's always a lesson to learn
Life's gonna change, win or loose
Every season must have its turn

Oh, look around and life just ain't the same
Search for reasons that you can't explain
When you think what's the use
What was said to me, I'll will say to you

Sometimes it rains, you feel some pain
But one thing is true, gray skies will turn to blue
With each new day one thing will stay the same
Everything, everything's gonna change

You know you find yourself wondering
Would the grass have been greener time and again
'Coz your circumstance keeps bringing you down
Over and over again

Oh, you search for reason that you can't explain
You look around but life just ain't the same
When you think what's the use
Remember what I'm telling you

Sometimes it rains, try to understand
But one thing is true, gray skies will turn to blue
With each new day one thing will stay the same
Everything, everything's, everything

Sometimes it rains, you feel some pain
But one thing is true, gray skies will turn to blue
With each new day one thing will stay the same
Everything, everything's gonna change

Please just try to understand
When life doesn't go as planned
This one thing that makes one change
Everything, everything, everything

Sometimes it rains, you feel some pain
But one thing is true, gray skies will turn to blue
With each new day one thing will stay the same
Everything, everything's gonna change

Sometimes it rains, you feel some pain
But one thing is true, gray skies will turn to blue
With each new day one thing will stay the same
Everything, everything's

Sometimes it rains, hey  blue
Everything, everything's gonna change, baby
