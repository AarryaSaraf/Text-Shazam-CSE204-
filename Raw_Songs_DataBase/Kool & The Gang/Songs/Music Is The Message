Whoo!
Alright, let's have a little fun out here!
It's alright!

Music is the message that sings
Universal love for one and all
A message for all seasons
Winter, summer, spring and fall, y'all

This message in the music
May put you in a trance, yeah, yeah
You may want to rejoice, get up
And dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance

Life is but a gamble
Come and take a chance
Gonna take some chances on my life?
You may find peace and happiness
Alright, be free and dance!
Dance to the music

The sounds that you hear
May be dear to your ear
So come on, people, join us
There's no need for fear
There's a message in the music
That will bring you peace of mind
So peace be with you, people
In these troubled times

Get on it!
Alright, alright!
Right on!
Alright!
It's alright!
Yes, it is

The sounds that you hear
May be dear to your ear
So come on, people, join us
There's no need for fear
There's a message in the music
That will bring you peace of mind
So peace be with you, people
In these troubled times

Ooh...
