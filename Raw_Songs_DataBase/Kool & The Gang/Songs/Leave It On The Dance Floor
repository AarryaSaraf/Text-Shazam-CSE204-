Only thing I need is dee jay to play my jam
Everybody get up and get down, get down
C'mon now everybody everybody get up get up
Everybody get up
Get down

I see you girl looking good whatcha doing over there
Get with me I'm living life and living without a care
An if you come dance with me I can change your life
Cause I'm living good like I should let me tell you what it's like

To be having fancy cars
Oh we be mingling with the stars
Yeah and you'll be buying out the bar
You know it, yeah you know who we are

Feeling a little loose
Now I got a drink up in my hand
Only thing I need is dee jay to play my jam

So the dee jay started changing up the beat
I was moving I could feel it in my feet
And the girl she grabbed me by the hand

She whispered in my ear and said
All I want to do is dance
She asked me do you, do you like the way I
Leave it on the dance floor

I said leave it girl
Go on leave it, go on leave it, go on leave it girl
I said leave it girl
Go on leave it, go on leave it, go on leave it girl

She asked me do you, do you like the way I
Leave it on the dance floor
I said leave it girl
Go on leave it, go on leave it, go on leave it girl
I said leave it girl
Go on leave it, go on leave it, go on leave it girl

I see you girl looking good whatcha doing over there
Get with me I'm living life and living without a care
And if you come dance with me I can change your life
Cause I'm living good like I should
Let me tell you what it's like

You'll be having fancy cars
Oh we'll be mingling with the stars
Yeah and you'll be buying out the bar
You know it, yeah you know who we are
So the dee jay started changing up the beat
I was moving I could feel it in my feet
And the girl she grabbed me by the hand
She whispered in my ear and said
