Hey, wait a minute
I think I see somethin'
Hey, is that you?
Hey, it's, uh, it's...
I found you
Water!

I searched the world thinking I'd never find you
All of my chances were a million to one
It seems that life would end before I found you
But now my journey's finally ended, yeah

I found my oasis
Yes, I found my oasis
When I found you
Hey, baby, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...

I see that now I should have never doubted
For now my time has finally come, ooh, yeah
It's been so long since I have waited for you
Baby, I know you're the one for me

I found my oasis
I found my oasis
When I found you
Hey, baby, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...

I found my oasis
Yes, I found my oasis
When I found you
Hey-hey, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
Baby, yeah

I found you finally!

I searched the world never thinking I'd find you
And now I have my oasis of love

I found my oasis
I found my oasis
When I found you
