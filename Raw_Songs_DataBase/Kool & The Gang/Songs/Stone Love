Girl, the first time we met
You took me by surprise
Ooh, girl you walked into my life
With those street corner blues
You were livin' in the fast lane
Much to my surprise baby
But I fell for you anyway
I'm addicted to your love, girl

Hey, stone love
Solid as a rock
I'm in love with you, baby
Stone love
Ooh, solid as a rock

Girl, our love is so unique
It's one of a kind
And girl, whenever we kiss
Its like a natural high
But we're livin' in the fast lane
Red lights flashin', baby
Will we ever change the way we are?
Stone love, girl

Oh, stone love
Solid as a rock
Stone love
Ooh, solid as a rock

The life we live is a challenge, mhmm
Always standin' on the edge
May not be the best way
But that's all we know
'Cause I don't wanna live my life alone, no

Oh, stone love, baby
I got you
Yes, I've got you
Got you under my skin
Yeah, yeah

Stone love
Oh, solid as a rock
That's the way we are, baby
Stone love
(Together, forever)
Ooh, solid as a rock
(Let me hold ya in my arms)
Stone love
(Woo, stone love)
Solid as a rock
(Ooh, baby)

May not be the best way
But that's all we know
'Cause I don't wanna live my life alone, no

La, la, la, la, la, stone love
La, la, la, stone love
Stone love
La, la, la, la, la, stone love
La, la, la, stone love
Stone love

Oh, love

(La, la, la, stone love)
You're everything I've ever wanted, baby
(Stone love)
(La, la, la, la, la, stone love)
Hey, yeah now, yeah
(La, la, la, stone love)
(Stone love)

Talkin' 'bout stone lovin'
(La, la, la, la, la, stone love)
'Bout me and you, girl
(La, la, la, stone love)
Stone love, girl
(Stone love)
(Ooh, stone love, girl)

Ooh, ooh
(La, la, la, la, la, stone love)
