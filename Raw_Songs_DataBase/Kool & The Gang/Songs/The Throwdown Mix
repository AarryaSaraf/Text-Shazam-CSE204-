To be lost in a state of confusion 
No sense of direction you can't be found 
Far from the truth of the slim and shady youth 
But it's all the same, yeah it's all the same to me 

That's what you say when you're falling down 
That's what you say when you throw down with me 
That's what you say when you're falling down 
That's what you get when you throw down with me 

With open arms you embrace abrasive action 
You welcome verbal violence your thoughts unsound 
You wear the message on your face I'll wipe it off without a trace  
'cause I'm all the rage, yeah I'm all the rage again 

That's what you say when you're falling down 
That's what you say when you throw down with me 
That's what you say when you're falling down 
That's what you get when you throw down with me 

If you could see that it's all the same to me 
I can't believe you can mean those things you say 
But the harder I keep running 
The harder I keep running 
The more you waste my time 

Don't look now but your friends are not around 
To protect the words they gave you to be just like them 
You say the words fuck you and yeah I've got a message to 
Hey we're all the same, in a way we're all the same as you 

That's what you say when you're falling down 
That's what you say when you're throwing down with me 
That's what you say when you're falling down 
That's what you get when you throw down with me 

If you could see that it's all the same to me 
I can't believe you can mean those things you say 
I can't believe the things you say  
I can't believe the things you say  
I can't believe the things you say  

But the harder I keep running 
The harder I keep running 
The more you waste my time 

If we can't get along we'll have to find a middle ground 
If we can agree that we disagree about the same things we believe to be true 
From me to you nothing but messages and paper planes 
Members only and memories end in the end the end 

If you could see that it's all the same to me 
I can't believe you can mean those things you say 
But the harder I keep running 
The harder I keep running 
The more you waste my time 

To be lost in a state of confusion 
No sense of direction you can't be found 
Far from the truth of the slim and shady youth 
But it's all the same it's all the same to me 

That's what you say when you're falling down 
That's what you say when you throw down with me 
That's what you say when you're falling down 
That's what you get when you throw down with me
