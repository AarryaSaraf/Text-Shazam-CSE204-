I was born in Memphis, she grew up in Jersey
Unlikely pair to ever fall in love
She has good education, strong determination
I learned my lessons on the road

I watch her as she's sleeping, kiss her gently seeing
Her smile, then she falls back to her dreams
Guess I'll walk to the bakery, buy her favorite pastry
You know the woman treats me well

I've had other relations, love situations
They ended inside out, upside down
I've cried tears when lonely, no one to hold me
Hey love, can you hear me call?

You know love, I'm so proud
Whatever you want is yours 'coz girl you've got my heart
When it was rain outside you sheltered me from the storm
Hello God above, thank you for true love

He said, someone like you
(Someone like you)
Will miss me for, will miss me for, will miss me forever
(Someone like you)

And he said, someone like you
(Someone like you)
Will miss me for, will miss me for, will miss me forever
(Someone like you)

We were married quietly on a beach in Cali'
The wind blew gently through your hair
Pastor Avery gave the vows there
Friends and family smiled there
Hey love, you know we will be happy

I live my life as a sensitive man
Wore my heart out on my sleeve
And every love in my life would use me up then leave
Hey love, you heard me call

You know love, I'm so proud
Whatever you need is yours, oh yeah
When it was rain outside you sheltered me from the storm
And hello God above, I thank you for true love

And he said, someone like you
(Someone like you)
And he said, someone like you
(Will miss me for, will miss me for, will miss me forever)
(Someone like you)

(Someone like you)
And he said, someone like you, yeah
(Will miss me for, will miss me for, will miss me forever)
(Someone like you)

(Someone like you)
Someone, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Someone like you)
I love you, I love you baby, someone like you
(Someone like you)

Whatever you want, it's yours
(Someone like you)
Whatever you need, it's yours baby
'Coz I love you, yeah, I love you
