Tell me what's goin' on
What's poppin', baby?
What's crackin'?
What's happening?
Tell me what's goin' on

What's poppin', baby?
What's crackin', baby?
What's happening?
Tell me what's goin' on

Hey baby, what you no good
I'm just gettin' back, but you knew I would
War is hell, when will it end?
When will people start gettin' together again?

Are things really gettin' better
Like the newspaper say?
What else is new my friend
Besides, what I've read?

Can't find no work
Can't find no job, my friend
Money is tighter than it's ever been
Say man, I just don't understand

What's goin' on?
What's poppin'?
Yeah, what's crackin'?
I wanna know what it is
What's happening?
Yeah, what's happening, brother?
