People need people

Just yesterday our nations became as one
To save those countless victims a way
Still the east is full of bombs that blast away
And children lose their innocence their heart to pray

Heroes come and heroes go, they save the day
But who will come and wash their tears away
Seems like Heaven cries all day
Still too low for zero, Heaven feels the pain

Too low for zero, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows, too low

Yes, it seems like Heaven is ten zillion miles away
When we go through earthly war, nature's ??
Still I know that God loves each and every soul
The children of the one eternal flame

Skin of bronze, hair like ?? you turn away
The color of the skin still the judge
Christian, Muslim, Jew and Buddhist, they live and pray
Forgive 'em Father, they know not what they do this day

Too low for zero, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows, too low

Hold on to your faith
Oh, as the world spins around
Just believe even though
That you're, you're below zero

Too low for zero, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows
Too low for zero, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows

Too low for zero, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows
Too low for zero, too low

Too low for zero, Heaven knows, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows, too low
Too low for zero, Heaven knows, too low
