Be true
Just be true
You, be true
Must be true
Be true

Just be true, whatever you do, well, yeah
Somebody's watchin', watching you
Somebody's watchin'
Just be true, me and you, well
Somebody's watchin' what you do
What you do, what you do

Don't think you'll get away
With all that jivin', jivin'
Follow your heart today
And keep on standin' stronger

You be you, I'll be me
Maybe someday we will see
You and me we'll see
Just be true, me and you, well
I know together we can do
Anything, yes we can

You should never hide
What you feel, what you feel inside
Keep your sense of pride
And hold your head up high

Be true
Just be true
You, be true
Must be true
Be true

Just be true, just be true, just be you

You should never hide
What you feel inside
Keep your sense of pride
Hold your head up high
Just be true

You should never hide
What you feel inside
Keep your sense of pride
Hold your head up high
Just be true

You should never hide
What you feel inside
Keep your sense of pride
Just be true

Just be true
