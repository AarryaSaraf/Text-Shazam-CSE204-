In order to win the fight
To make things right
We all must unite
In order to win the fight
To make things right
We all must unite

Years ago, our doors were locked
A nation undivided and people traveled free
Farmers and fishermen, we all live as one
Had one destiny and everybody knew we lived in peace

Come together, all nations, with no boundaries
Let's make our two as whole
And let's not forget the sound of gunfire
Our time has come, a new day has begun
Before our work is done, we all must become one
Yeah, yeah

In order to win the fight
To make things right
We all must unite
We all must unite, yeah, yeah
In order to win the fight
We all must unite

We are family
Let's not be divided by the countries we live in
This, our country
Let's do it for our children and our nations, yeah

Out in this great big sun there's only one type of people
South, north, east, west, we're all created equal
Let's drop our differences, war, let's end it
By living in peace and harmony like God intended
What's more for, somebody needs to ask it
To see that the only cure is in a pine box casket
If that's the case, then we can kiss goodbye the human race
What's it gonna be like when our babies are growin' up
Chaos, mayhem, the little world blowin' up
We oughta make that change
Before the world's rearranged with war and bloodstains
Embrace me, brother, with all your might
Come together as one, we must unite, Kool and the Gang
We gotta get together if we wanna win the fight

Come together, all nations, with no boundaries
Let's make our two as whole
And let's not forget the sound of gunfire
Our time has come, a new day has begun
Before our work is done, we all must become one

We are family
Let's not be divided by the countries we live in
This, our country
Let's do it for our children and our nations

Ooh-ooh-ooh...
Oh...
Oh, yeah
We are one nation under the sun
Yeah, yeah, yeah

We all are one people
One people under the sun
We all are one nation
One nation under the sun

Yeah, yeah, yeah
We gotta be together, everybody
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
We are one nation under the sun, yeah

We all are one people
(Tell me what it is, what it is)
(What it is, yeah)
One people under the sun
(We all must unite, yeah)
We all are one nation
(Oh, yeah)
One nation under the sun
(One people, one nation)
(One people, one nation)

We all are one people
(Oh, everybody, yeah)
One people under the sun
(We must unite, oh, we must unite)
(Yeah, yeah)
We all are one nation
(We've got to live as one)
One nation under the sun
(Nations undivided, people all are free, yeah...)
