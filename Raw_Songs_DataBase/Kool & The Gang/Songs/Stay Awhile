Shoo-be-do-do, shoo-be-do-do
(I know we can make it, baby)
Shoo-be-do-do-do
Hey, lady, yes, you
I just want you to stay
(I know you've been hurt before)
Shoo-be-do-do, shoo-be-do-do
You see, it's gonna be alright, that's all
(But I can make you so happy)
Shoo-be-do-do-do
(Stay with me, ooh-ooh-ooh...)

Hey, baby, where're you going
Love is here, don't act like you don't know
Don't let your heart grow cold
'Cause you will only lose, well
You've got to know by now, girl

Stay awhile with me
Won't you stay awhile with me
And let my love light your fire

Oh, boy, love is sweet and always mellow
I know it feels good to love
But I've been fooled before
You oughta know by now
That love don't come easy
So when we spend some time, oh

If I stay, don't be cruel
Don't you blow my mind
If I spend some time with you
If I stay, don't be cruel
Don't you blow my mind
If I spend some time with you
If I stay awhile, ooh...

Shoo-be-do-do, shoo-be-do-do
Oh, angel, I know you've been hurt before
Shoo-be-do-do-do
(That's all we need)
But life fills the sweetness and the sorrow
Shoo-be-do-do, shoo-be-do-do
(If you just stay awhile, stay awhile with me)
But just give this thing a chance and stay
Shoo-be-do-do-do
It's alright, girl, that's all
(Ooh-ooh-ooh...)

Stay with me
Won't you stay awhile with me
And let my love light your fire

Love is sweet and always mellow
I know it feels good to love, baby, baby
Don't it feel good to love, angel
Now, ooh...

Stay awhile with me
Won't you stay awhile with me
And let my love light your fire

Can't get enough of your love
Your love, stay awhile
Can't get enough of your love
Your love, stay awhile...
