Hey love hey love you always make my day shine
I've been watching you just like the sun rise
You been down been down I seen it all in your eyes
Cause you kept you kept messing round with the wrong guys

I know you're looking at me like boy I heard this before (but girl)
You do pretty good for yourself but you deserve so much more
Baby I'm gonna give you everything you want and need girl
Now that you're here with me

Life got so much better when I added you
And there ain't nothing like having you all to all to myself
And you're mine all mine can't nothing top you
Gonna have a good time now that I got you all to all to myself

So glad I got you all to (ohhh) myself
So glad I got you all to (ohhh) myself
So glad I got you all to (ohhh) myself
So glad I got you all to (ohhh) myself

How could how could anyone ignore you
I would I would do anything for you
I know I know your heart has been broken
It's ok ok cause I need it to be open

I'm so glad I'm loving you now and I can say I'm your man (I'm your man)
As long as it's me who's rubbing you down then baby you're in good hands
Baby I'm gonna give you everything you want and need girl
Now that you're here with me

Life got so much better when I added you
And there ain't nothing like having you all to all to myself
And you're mine all mine can't nothing top you
Gonna have a good time now that I got you all to all to myself

So glad I got you all to (ohhh) myself
So glad I got you all to (ohhh) myself

You put a smile on my face when I'm thinking of you
Cause I get to love you all to myself ohhhh
You put a smile on my face when I'm thinking of you
Cause I get to love you all to myself all to myself

Life got so much better when I added you
And there ain't nothing like having you all to all to myself
And you're mine all mine can't nothing top you
Gonna have a good time now that I got you all to all to myself

So glad I got you all to (ohhh) myself
So glad I got you all to (ohhh) myself
So glad I got you all to (ohhh) myself
So glad I got you all to (ohhh) myself
