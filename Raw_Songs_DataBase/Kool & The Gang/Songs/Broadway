In the beginning, every thing was new
City lights, those subway sounds
I was a young blood, fell in love with you
You looked so beautiful

At the matinee, on Broadway
She threw a kiss my way, Broadway
I fell in love, Broadway
Fell in love with the leading lady, yeah

Anticipation, ran within my mind
Butterflies were flying high
After the encore, would this be the time
That love would bring us together

But when the curtain fell on Broadway
The theater was an empty shell, Broadway
Tell me, where did she go, on Broadway
Guess I'll never know, I'll never, never know

So, baby, take it to the stage so we can dance
You and I, a virgin romance
Take it to the stage where love began
My imagination, let's make pretend
I fell in love, ooh-ooh...

Well, she stole my heart
And I was so young and I didn't understand it
But I waited and I waited and I waited
To see, was she a widow, or out and come around to marry, yeah

Oh, yeah
(Broadway)
Anticipation run in on my mind
(Broadway)
What a weight on my mind, my mind
Broadway
On Broadway, Broadway
