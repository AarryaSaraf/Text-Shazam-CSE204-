People, get ready
It's time to show what you got
Players, take your places
There's only one way to the top

You must feel that victory, release that energy
And ride like the wind
With fire in your eyes, shake those butterflies
And do the best that you can

Victory (Sweet) Victory
Let the party begin, uh-huh
Victory (Sweet) Victory
Let's do it again

You are the best
You seem to stand out from the rest
Ooh, your intentions
To be more than an honorable mention

You must feel that victory, release that energy
And ride like the wind
With fire in your eyes, shake those butterflies
Go ahead, and go for the win, now

Victory, victory
Let the party begin, uh-huh
Victory, (Sweet) Victory
Everybody can win

'Cause it's the same way in life (Same way in life)
Inside the tunnel, see the light
Perfect balance, you must find
It's the same way in life

Victory, victory, victory

(Victory is sweet, ooh-ooh)
(Victory is sweet)
(Victory is sweet) Oh, can you feel it?
(Victory is sweet) So sweet, so sweet

There's only one way to the top
If you really want it, you can never stop pushin'
For the victory, go ahead, go ahead
Players, take your places
Go ahead

Yeah, feel that victory, release that energy
Yeah
So sweet to the top
Go ahead
Go ahead

Players, take your places
To the top
Victory, go ahead

Victory is sweet, victory
Let's do it again
Victory (Sweet) Victory
Let the party begin
