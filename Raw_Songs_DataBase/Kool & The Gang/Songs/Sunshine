Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh...
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah...

Come with me and journey with my mind
We will travel into greater times
Spirits blend and flying around, strong with time
In a truce, we'll make the union shine

We'll find our strength from above
Life and rejoice and love

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do...
Do-do-do-do-do-do...

Sunshine, my, my
My, sunshine, sunshine
My, my, sunshine
Sunshine, my, my, my, my

Sunshine, my, my
My, sunshine, sunshine
My, my, sunshine
Sunshine, my, my, my, my...
