You're the only one who made my troubles disappear
Was searching for someone to take my mind away from here
When you hit me I'm feening, got me thinking I'm dreaming
And you still got me leaning, you're so so good, you take me there
It's bound to happen when I'm next to you again
I got no choice cause every step with you ascends

I feel so high when I'm with you baby
Fly me to the moon
I come so alive it's driving me crazy
Now here comes the boom
I feel so high, so high high
I feel so high
I feel so high

You have me under the spell that's in your eyes
You know you have this way with me that most would criticize
But you know how to relieve me, you just get me completely
And you do it so easy, you're so so good I'm hypnotized
It's bound to happen when I'm next to you again
I got no choice cause every step with you ascends

I feel so high when I'm with you baby
Fly me to the moon
I come so alive it's driving me crazy
Now here comes the boom
I feel so high, so high high
I feel so high, so high high
I feel so Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

I feel so high when I'm with you baby
Fly me to the moon
So alive it's driving me crazy
Now here comes the boom
I feel so high, so high high
I feel so high, you make me feel oh you make me feel
So high high
I feel so high
I feel so high, I feel so
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
