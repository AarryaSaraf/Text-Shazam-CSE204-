Without music and a song
What would the world be like
If we all could get along
We could live in peace and harmony

Fill the world of love together
Make it last forever and ever, yeah!

It's time for love and understanding

If we change the wrong to right
This whole world would be a better place
For you and me, oh, can't you see
