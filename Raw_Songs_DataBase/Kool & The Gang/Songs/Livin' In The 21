Hold your head up
Hold your head up
Hold your head up
You gotta try to find the love

I know there's a power
That lifts us high and higher
I believe in mankind
What divides us is just a change of mind

My friends came home from war today
Sad to listen to words they had to say
They saw humanity go astray
If it wasn't for the faith, we wouldn't be here today

Whole time the world spins around
These are the days, the days of our lives
Gotta have a little faith livin' in the 21
Gotta have a little faith livin' in the 21

Maybe your body only knows pain
Maybe your hearts' been broken again
Lost your job in buyin' necessities
Inside you're screamin', 'I got to be free'

You know there's a power
That lifts us high and higher
Deep in your heart, down in your soul
Have a little faith and then let it flow

Whole time the world spins around
These are the days, the days of our lives
Gotta have a little faith livin' in the 21
Gotta have a little faith livin' in the 21

Gotta keep the faith, you can't give in
Gotta run this race and gotta try to win
Gotta hold your head up and smile again
Thank God for all your family and friends

And when it gets rough and when it gets tough
Hold your head up, you gotta try to find the love
Can't take the pain that this world brings
Sometimes you feel like you wanna scream

Step fast, now move on, you gotta pray
When time get hard, you can't stray away
Stay focused, you gotta try to reach your goal
Many troubles and trials gonna be down that road

Listen to the signs, gotta keep a clear mind
Livin' in the 21, you stay on your grind
Hold tight 'coz you know this world gon' spin
But you come out on top, you know you will win

Whole time the world spins around
These are the days, the days of our lives
Gotta have a little faith livin' in the 21
Gotta have a little faith livin' in the 21

Whole time the world spins around
These are the days, the days of our lives
Gotta have a little faith livin' in the 21
Gotta have a little faith livin' in the 21

Livin' in the 21
Livin' in the 21
We gotta have faith today

Keep your mind on exactly what you do
Don't let nobody mess up what you do
Hold tight in exactly what you do
Keep livin' good and doin' what you do

Have faith 'coz we livin' in the 21
Stand tall 'coz we livin' in the 21
Father, help us 'coz we livin' in the 21
Can?t cry no more 'coz we livin' in the 21

When you think you done it all, you just gotta stand
Anything you wanna do, I'm tellin' you bet you can
Complete your dreams and do the master plans
When you think you done it all, you just gotta stand

Have faith 'coz we livin' in the 21
Stand tall 'coz we livin' in the 21
Father, help us 'coz we livin' in the 21
Can?t cry no more 'coz we livin' in the 21
