Let' go where the people go
That's where we want to be
Dancin' in the disco-light
Shine all over me

Music playing loud and clear
'Cause that's we, we want to hear
So let's go where they disco down
We'll rock and shake our bodies to the ground
Hangin' out, hangin' out

We're gonna rock and shake
Our bodies to the ground

Everybody hurry down
It's gonna be a night on the town
Sweet music will build the air
It's all about hangin' out
Got to see you there

You will move to the beat
In the disco heat
Hangin' out, everybody's coming

We're gonna rock and shake
Your bodies to the ground

Everybody hurry down
It's gonna be a night on the town
Sweet music will build the air
It's all about hangin' out
Got to see you there

Shake it down, baby
Did you get the news?
We ain't got no time to lose
Please don't hesitate
We don't wanna be late

Everybody hurry down
It's gonna be a night on the town
Sweet music will build the air
It's all about hangin' out
Got to see you there

Come on with your dancing shoes
We ain't got no time to lose
Come on with your disco-scats
We don't wanna be late, hangin' out
