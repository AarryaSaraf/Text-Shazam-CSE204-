Father, where's the love I thought there would be?
Where's the happiness in me?
Is life just an endless walk to nowhere?
With streets that just lead to dead ends?
Where parents water their flowers with hate
And children do the same
But who's to blame?
Spring?
No, it's just a gentle thing
But man flies around the moon and sings a song that stars with June
And eats his lunch at every moon
In harmony he does this
But with love, is out of tune

Father, father, father, you were surely right
If the world should end tomorrow
It would be by man's own might
Lord have mercy on us
Seems to be a favorite line
Wherever we're down or in trouble
Or blocks to eternal divine

Father, there's war and worry
Lord, there's hurt and sorrow
And won't you live to see tomorrow

Father, father, father, what can we do what's right
Lord, please smile upon us
Give us your guiding light

What can we do what's right
Lord, please smile upon us
Give us your guiding light

Father, where's the love I thought there would be?
Where's the happiness in me?

Lord, you know, I know you know, father
