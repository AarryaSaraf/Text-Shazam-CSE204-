It's been a long time since I held you tight
It's been a long time since I kissed you good night
What's a man supposed to do
When he's still in love with you, girl

It's been a long time since we made love
It's been a long time since I told you that I care
What's a girl supposed to do
Now that it's over
Between me and you


If we can't be lovers
Maybe we can be friends
If our love has lost the magic
Let's be friends 'til the very end
If we can't be lovers
Maybe we can be friends
Since our love has lost the magic
Let's be friends

It's been a long time since we said I do
It's been a long time since we made plans for two
What are we supposed to do
Now that it's over
Between me and you



Life is much too short
And we don't know when it will end
A sunny day or rainy night
There's no way of tellin'

We can't throw away all those years
Filled with happiness
We've got one good reason
To give it our best

Inside you lives a part of me
And He's gonna need the two of us
To help fulfill his dreams
