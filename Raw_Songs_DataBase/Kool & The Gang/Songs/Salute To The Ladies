You've come a long way, Baby,
To get where you belong
You've come a long way,
And still you've got it going on

We're sending out this message
We want the world to know
It's time to show the Ladies
Just how much we love them so


Red, yellow, black or white
It doesn't matter what you are tonight
We're gonna celebrate - put your name in lights
Come to attention,
Everybody on the floor!


Salute to the Ladies
"Give it up" for the Ladies
Salute to the Ladies
'Cause we love you

Salute to the Ladies
"Give it up" for the Ladies
Salute to the Ladies

You've come a long way, Baby,
To get where you belong
Just like Aretha,
You're the Queen on the throne

We're sending out this message
To every house and home
It's time to show the Girls
That we respect and love them so
