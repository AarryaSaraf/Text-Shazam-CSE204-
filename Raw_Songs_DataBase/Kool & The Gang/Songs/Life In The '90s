Life in the 90's
So good, so bad.
State of affairs

Life in the 90's
So good, so bad.
State of affairs

I remember when 1990 came in
We celebrated all night long
1991, South Africa's under the gun
They had to let Mandela go



Brand new President
An historical event, back in 1992
Billboard Magazine says black music is the king
Teddy gave us New Jack Swing



Sex is not the same
AIDS made us change the game
Back in 1994
In 1995 people almost lost their mind
Getting high on this thing crack



1996, Olympic games are in the mix
Atlanta, Georgia put on the show
1997, Heaven only knows
Where this thing is gonna go



1999 it's the sign of the times
And Revelation's told us so
