Mama use to always say
Life is only what you make of it
So if you feeling bad today
Why not go and celebrate

So grab a glass and make a toast
To happiness, let's make the most

I don't know (I don't know) what you gonna do
But tonight I'll have a good time (a good time)

Forget about (forget about) what you going through
Tonight let's have a good time (a good time)

What'cha what'cha gonna do
What'cha what'cha gonna do
Wooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
Wooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo

Light it up and pour the wine
Do what you do to free your mind and if
Your problems ever seem to rise
Just leave'em leave'em all behind

So lift your glass and make a toast
To happiness, let's make the most

I don't know (I don't know) what you gonna do
But tonight I'll have a good time (a good time)

Forget about (forget about) what you going through
Tonight let's have a good time (a good time)

What'cha what'cha gonna do
What'cha what'cha gonna do

C'mon break it down break it down
C'mon break it down break it down
C'mon break it on break it on
Break it on down

Tell me what it's gonna be (what's it gonna be)
Bring your money and your I.D.
The lights going up, no slowing up
Don't you wanna be free (don't ya wanna be free)

Tell me what it's gonna be
Bring your money and your I.D.
The lights going up, no slowing up
Don't you wanna be free

So grab a glass and make a toast
To happiness, let's make the most

I don't know (I don't know) what you gonna do
But tonight I'll have a good time (a good time, a good time)

Forget about (forget about) what you going through
Tonight let's have a good time (a good time)

I don't know (I don't know) what you gonna do
But tonight I'll have a good time (a good time)

Forget about (forget about) what you going through
But tonight I'll have a good time (a good time)
