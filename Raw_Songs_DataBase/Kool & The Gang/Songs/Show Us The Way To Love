Sunset has come to the city by the ocean
He finds his shelter for the night
Soup boils over at some welfare hotel
While she prays to feed her children well

Somewhere a tender soul is wounded
Somehow an innocence is lost
So we live a life of tunnel vision
Forgetting to see what we want

Show us the way to love
Show us the road turn
Which way the road to love
Show us the way to love
Show us to love

Morning has come to a city on the river
People dressed in black, cars in a row
Another live taken by some scourge of mankind
There'll be details on news at nine

Somewhere a tender soul is wounded
Somehow an innocence is lost

Show us the way to love
Show us the road turn
Which way the road to love
Show us the way to love
Show us to love

Mmm-mm-mm-mm...

Twilight has come to a town on the mountains
Family is shunned for the skin they live in
One more role model falls by the wayside
People, who do we look up to now, whoa...

Somewhere a tender soul is wounded
Somehow an innocence is lost

Show us the way to love
Show us the road turn
Which way the road to love
Show us the way to love
Show us to love
Show us the way

For you are the flame
The sparkling is inside of you
And we must reclaim
What we were from the start
It's a matter of heart, yeah

Show us the way to love
Show us the road turn
Which way the road to love
Show us the way to love
Show us to love

Show us the way to love
Show us the road turn
Which way the road to love
Show us the way to love
Show us to love
Show us the road to love

Show us the way to love
Show us to love
Which way the road to love
Show me the way to love
Show us to love
Show me the way to love

Teach me to love, to love
Show us to love, to love
Show us the way to love
Teach us to love
The way to love
