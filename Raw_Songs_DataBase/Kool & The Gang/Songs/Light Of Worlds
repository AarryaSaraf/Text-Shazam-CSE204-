In the darkness, of this world
Please give us your light...

Someone's watching
But you can't see
Don't you know what he's after?
In the pool hall
Behind the 8 ball
Can't you see who he's after?
Someone's praying
But they keep playing
With their lives
They don't want them
If by sundown
They all can't be found
I don't know what will happen

We should try to understand
To help our brothers all we can
Give us light, give us lots of light
Yes, we need the light, light of worlds

Someone's listening
But you can't hear
Don't you know what he's after?
In the alley (go, go, Sally)
Can't you see what he's after?
Someone's crying
But they keep lying
With their lives
They will play some
Look who's running
Who's that hiding?
Don't you know what he's after?

We should try to understand
To help our sisters all we can
Give us light, give us lots of light
Yes, we need the light, won't you share the light?
Give us light, give us lots of light
Yes, we need the light, won't you share the light?

In the darkness of this world
Please give us your light...
