Now I only want to love you
If you are my dream, my dream come true
To have you here in my life
Would ease the grief and strife
For you my love will never end
Don't hesitate to let it in
Just let my love caress your heart
And we'll never part

Each day in love together
Won't be like any other
Our nights will last a little longer
With you I'm so much stronger, mm-hmm
I'll whisper gently in your ear
And ease away your every fear
It's our own little world
Let's keep it alive

Forever you, forever me, forever love
Forever you, forever me, forever love

Through the years we have held the greatest love
One that's so wonderful, so rare
I don't think that I could love this way again
Lady, should we let it end, this love affair

Forever you, forever me, forever love
Forever you, forever me, forever love

With time to guide us through the years
We both will see
Love can last eternally, if we let it be
Let's hold each other ever so tenderly
In perfect harmony, forever

Forever you, forever me, forever love
Forever you, forever me, forever love

Let's do it for love
Forever you, forever me, forever love
Forever you, forever me, forever love

Let's do it for love
Forever you, forever me, forever love
Forever you, forever me, forever love...
