 saw a light and she promised her child
To carry him through and give birth on that side
In a dingy hotel on the north of the line
She gave birth to a boy and went into the lie

High in the skies, stars are pointing their light
To a place on the map we are dying to find
There's a bill on the books from the ancestor's law
It is written in code yet it speaks to us all

America
Some say that it's physical
Some say that it's spiritual
Some say it's a miracle, oh, so beautiful
(America)

Some say that it's physical
Some say that it's spiritual
Some say it's a miracle, oh, so beautiful

A young man had won from the hounds and the guns
They had a built up this world from the sweat of his brow
Now he dreamed of his seed growing strong over time
No child of his will live south of the line

Eagle told men when he showed at the shore
That a promise was written and sealed in her core
I can tell you no more then this land is alive
You can call it your own but you can't own a lie

America
Some say that it's physical
Some say that it's spiritual
Some say it's a miracle, oh, so beautiful
(America)

Some say that it's physical
Some say that it's spiritual
Some say it's a miracle, oh, so beautiful

Some say that it's physical

America, my life
I want the whole world to know the reason why
I want to live, not die
I want the whole world to know the reason why
America, oh, so beautiful
