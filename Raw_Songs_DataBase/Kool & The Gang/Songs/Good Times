Are you ready?

Whoo!
Oh, yeah!
What's happenin' man?
Good times are on my mind
School is out, summertime!

Good times on my mind
Good times on my mind
Good times on my mind
Good times on my mind

Good times are on my mind
School is out in the summertime
They're chasing time for the workin' man
People on the beach and playin' in the sand
Ow!

Good times on my mind
Get down!
Get it up!
What you say?

Groovy!
Do, do, do, do!
Yeah!

People catchin' trains and on their way
Buses and trains, and whatever you say, baby
The sun is shinin' its radiant light
The moon is out for the lovers tonight
Oh, yeah!
Whoo!

Get down!
Get on down!

Whoo!

Yeah
Do it!

Do it!
Do it, do it!
(Good times on my mind)
Do it!
Do it, do it!
Do it!
Do it, do it!
Do it!
Do it, do it!
Do it!
Do it, do it!

Do it, do it!
Do it, do it!
Do it!
Do it, do it, yeah!
Do it, do it!
Do it, do it!
Do it, do it!
Do it, do it!

Come on
Oh, yeah!
Whoo, come on

Think about the good times, yeah
Think about the good times
Think about the good times, yeah...
