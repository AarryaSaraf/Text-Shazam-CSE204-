Spinning 'round in your dance of life like a hurricane
'Round and 'round we search for love in a world gone insane
Where's the Joy? Where's the laughter? Have we all gone astray?
Hold on tight, don't give up for love is on the way

What we need, is a peacemaker
What we need, is a hero for the world
What we need, is a peacemaker
This old world is calling out man, woman, child

There must be someone
Somewhere to show the beauty and the power of love
Could be you, could be me that someone from all nations
Come together, our world as one for we are the hero generation

What we need, is a peacemaker
What we need, is a mighty mountain of love
What we need, is a peacemaker
Hearts will praise that precious beauty

When the time has finally come, this song of love
These words of light will help, lift you towards the sun
We bring peacemaker, peacemaker, mighty mountain of love
Peacemaker, peacemaker, hero for the world

What we need, is a peacemaker
What we need, is a mighty mountain of love
What we need, is a peacemaker, a mountain of love
What we need, is a peacemaker, peacemaker
What we need, is a peacemaker, peacemaker
What we need, is a peacemaker, a mountain of love
