Dave, save our humanity
'Cause only you can see tale of our history
Dave, save our humanity
'Cause only you can see tale of our history

So out of control
When truth is told
Nobody knows

Dave, save our humanity
'Cause only you can see tale of our history
Dave, save our humanity
Are we the enemy spreading insanity?

So out of control
When truth is told
Nobody knows, Dave

See us from the skies above
Man was born only to love
Right our wrongs to God above
All are one, not them or us

Teach a lesson hard to learn
Precious gifts cannot be earned
In our hearts the seed of trust
Torn away by greed and lust

Let the children go where the wild winds blow
Leave our seeds to grow, brave new world to know
Only love will sow, only peace can grow
Let the children go, save the children

Let the children go where the wild winds blow
Leave our seeds to grow, brave new world to know
Only love will sow, only peace can grow
Let the children go, save the children

Save the children, save the children
Save the children, save the children
Save the children, save the children
Save the children, save the children, save the children
