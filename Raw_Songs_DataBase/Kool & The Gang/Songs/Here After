Here after
When freedom, justice and equality will ring in the hearts and in the minds of all men.
Here after
When man has consumed knowledge, wisdom and understanding from what he has overlooked for so long.
Yes, there will be peace for all, here after.

Here after, when hate is gone
Here after, we'll sing a song of love
Here after, when hate is removed
Here after, no fear.. No fear
Just love

Here after
