Life's a song in your heart
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo, yo)
Life with music in your soul
Life's a song in your heart
(Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah, oh, yo, yo)
Life with music in your soul

Your heart's the fire
Burning with desire
Your passion's burning
Like a burning flame
Wisdom light shines on a few
Well, you're a child
Who really wants a view
You possess the greatest seed
Love is all you really, really
Really, really need

Life's a song in your heart
Life with music in your soul
(Deep down in your soul)
Life's a song in your heart
(Yeah, in your heart)
Life with music in your soul

Let your heart just be your guide
Take your mind and search inside
What you cannot see with eyes
Let you know you can't deny, life

Life's a song in your heart
Life with music in your soul
(Just like a song, we sing)
Life's a song in your heart
(Y'all sing)
Life with music in your soul
(Can you feel it)

Life's a song in your heart
Life with music in your soul
Life's a song in your heart
(You possess the greatest seed)
Life with music in your soul
(Love is all you really, really)
(Really, really need)

Life's a song in your heart
Life with music in your soul
(Deep down in your soul)
Life's a song in your heart
(Yeah, in your heart)
Life with music in your soul

Life's a song in your heart
Life with music in your soul
Life's a song in your heart
Life with music in your soul...
