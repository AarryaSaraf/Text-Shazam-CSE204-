Wild is love
It is everything you feel inside
Like an early spring
That takes away the chill
And leaves a warmth inside

Sitting in my chair
With my head between my hands
Thinking of you and me
How happy we will be
Loving you today
Was all I wanted anyway
We can be happy, girl, together

Wild is love
It is everything you feel inside
Like an early spring
That takes away the chill
And leaves a warmth inside

Sitting in my chair
With my head between my hands
Thinking of you and me
How happy we will be
Loving you today
Was all I wanted anyway
We can be happy, girl, together

Loving you is all that I desire
You in every dream I dream
Loving you is all that I desire
You in every dream I dream, mm-hmm...
