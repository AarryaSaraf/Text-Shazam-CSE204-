Get it now

Get it right
Free your mind

Change your style and wear a smile
Come on down and party wild
(You got to)
Be for real, do what you feel
You can make it but you got to feel
(You got to)
Do your best, it's all it takes
Get in the race and don't lose your pace
Are you sad, you should be glad
Get out your seat and get on your feet
Do it right now

Do it right now
Get together and do it forever
Do it right now

Change your style and wear a smile
Come on down and party wild
Be for real, do what you feel
You can make it but you got to feel
(Do it right now)
Do your best, it's all it takes
Get in the race and don't lose your pace
Are you sad, you should be glad
Get out your seat, get on your feet
(Do it, do it, do it)
Do it right now

Do it, do it, do it
Do it right now
Get together and do it forever
Do it right now

Do it, do it, do it
Do it right now
Do it right now
Do it, do it, do it
Do it right now
Uh, yeah!
Do it, do it, do it
Do it right now
