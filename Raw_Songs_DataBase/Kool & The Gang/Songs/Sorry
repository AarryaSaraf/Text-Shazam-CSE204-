I'm so sorry
You want me back?
I never meant to hurt you, baby
You want me back?
Oh, I'm so sorry

Fame changed the game for us
It's a shame 'coz our love just couldn't remain the same
Couldn't last because of what we had in common
Reachin' for the stars, tryin' to run this game

In my mind, you're still all mine
In my heart, you're never left behind
I still see the way you walked out that door
With those tears in your eyes
I replay it a thousand times

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I'm sorry for the night I've been astray

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I'm sorry for the night I've been astray

Didn't see until it was too late
And what we had was so special, baby
Now I realized that all I have
Really means nothin' without you by my side

But in my mind, you're still all mine
And in my heart, you're never left behind
I still see the way you walked out that door
With those tears in your eyes
I replay it a thousand times

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I'm sorry for the night I've been astray

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I'm sorry for the night I've been astray

Oh, this pain I feel
Coincide with you not here
Now and then that I see it so clear
I wanna say I miss you, my dear

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I'm sorry for the night I've been astray

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I'm sorry for the night I've been astray

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I'm sorry for the night I've been astray

I'm sorry, babe, I need your love
To feel your touch, to be in love
To make my rainy days go away
I'm sorry for the night I've been astray

So sorry, babe, so sorry, babe
'Coz I need you, need you in my life, my life
So sorry, babe, so sorry, so sorry, so sorry
I never meant to hurt you, sorry, babe, i need you, babe
I love you, baby, I want you, baby
