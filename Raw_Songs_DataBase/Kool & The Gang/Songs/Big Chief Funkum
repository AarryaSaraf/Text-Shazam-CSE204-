Big Chief Funk no swing to nobody's thing
Funk is what we bring!

Get down, Big Chief, get down

Big Chief gets funky all the time
Funk stays on his mind
Funk is really fine
Big Chief says funk is in the mind
Funk is really not
A power to the prime

Some people really like to swing
When they do their thing
Thinkin' they're the king
Big Chief don't really like to swing
Swingin' ain't his thing
Funk is what he brings

I like funkin' with you, Chief
Can you show me how to funk it like you do

Yeah, get down, dance!
Get down, whoa-whoa-whoa, yeah
Get down, do it, do it
Get down, do it, do it

I like dancin' with you, Chief
Can you show me how to do it like you do
Do it, do it

Stop pullin' my feathers!

Big Chief stays funky all the time
If funkin' was a crime
We'd be doin' time
Big Chief says funk is what you feel
When it's really real
Doin' what you will

Some people really like to swing
When they do their thing
Thinkin' they're the king
Big Chief don't really like to swing
Swingin' ain't his thing
Funk is what he brings

I like funkin' with you, Chief
Can you show me how to funk it like you do

Get down, dance!
Get down, whoa-whoa-whoa, yeah
Get down, do it, do it
Get down, do it, do it

I like funkin' with you, Chief
Can you show me how to funk it like you do
Do it, do it

Get down, dance!
Get down, whoa-whoa-whoa, yeah
Get down, do it, do it
Get down, do it, do it...
