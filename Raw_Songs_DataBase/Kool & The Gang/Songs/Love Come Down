Girl, seems to me
That we should be together
And, girl, you know I'll give
My heart to you forever
Let's spend some time together
'Cause precious moments are so few
Girl, I see my future in you, oh...

Ooh, baby, baby
Baby, let your love come down
Let your love come down
(Whoa-oh-oh...)
Ooh, baby, baby
Baby, let your love come down
Let your love come down
(Yeah)

Girl, I know your heart
Has seen stormy weather
And, girl, I'll give to you
A love that's true forever
Let's spend the night together
'Cause precious moments are so few
Girl, I see my future in you, oh...

Ooh, baby, baby
Baby, let your love come down
Let your love come down
(Mm-hmm, mmm...)
Ooh, baby, baby
Baby, let your love come down
(Girl, let, it come down, down, down)
Let your love come down
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Let's spend our lives together
Precious moments are so few
Girl, I see my future in you
You, you, you, you, yeah, yeah

Ooh, baby, baby
Baby, let your love come down
Let your love come down
(Don't be afraid of me, baby, no, no)
Ooh, baby, baby
Baby, let your love come down
You can count on me, you can count on me
You can count on me
(Oh-oh-oh-oh...)

Ooh, baby, baby
(Oh, girl)
Baby, let your love come down
'Cause I just want to love you right, girl, yeah
Ooh, baby, baby
Baby, let your love come down
Love you right, hold you tight
Love you right all through the night, baby...
