People!
The world today is in a very difficult situation
And we all know it
We must heal all the wounds of war
Inhumanity and pollution
Because we are responsible
For the care of this Earth and all its children
We must learn to live together
And to love each other
I believe that one day
Our Creator will let us know
Who's gonna take the weight!
