Somewhere the sky is dark
Somewhere it's blue
And somewhere there's false love
Somewhere it's true
Just know that the sun never leaves without rising tomorrow
Rising tomorrow

Sometimes a good day finishes rough
You pictured it perfect, but it called your bluff
But before you give up know
At the end of the rope you must be strong
Grab it real tight and you just

Hold on, just hold on
Hold on, don't you give up now
Hold on, just hold on
Just hold on, don't you give up now

Some call it growing
Some call it pain
Some see a rainbow
Some see the rain
Just know that when your head is down there's no choice but to look up
No choice but to look up

Sometimes a bad day finishes great
May seem like a spell but turns out being fate
But before you give up know
At the end of the rope you must be strong
Grab it real tight and you just

Hold on, just hold on
Just hold on, don't you give up now
Hold on, just hold on
Just hold on, just hold on
Hold tight and never let go
Don't you give up now

This is your song, hold on
The suns not gone, hold on
It won't be long, hold on
Just stay strong, hold on
This is your song, hold on
The sun's not gone, hold on
It won't be long, hold on
Just stay strong

You just hold on, just hold on
Hold on and don't give up
Don't you give up now
Hold on, hold on
Just hold on, just hold on
Don't ever give up, don't you give up now

This is your song, hold on
The sun's not gone, hold on
It won't be long, hold on
Just stay strong, hold on
This is your song, hold on
The sun's not gone, hold on
It won't be long, hold on
Just stay strong, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, just hold on
