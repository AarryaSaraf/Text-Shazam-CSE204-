I don't know for certain
How long our love can last
All I know is how I feel
And time will surely pass
So for now I'll hold you in my arms
And give right now to you

Mine is not to promise you
Tomorrow's goings-on
For time reveals our destinies
In life before too long
Let me give you
What is truly mine to give
Let me give right now to you

I don't know where we'll go
Or if the sun will even shine
Again before my very eye
I know that I'm in love with you now
If we could see tomorrow somehow
We will awake to another day
And I will walk you by my side

Let me give right now to you
Tomorrow may not ever come
Let me give right now to you
Tomorrow may not ever come
Let me give right now to you

Now you're down, you're sorrowful
Because I feel this way
But I can only offer you
The promise of today
Let me give you
What is truly mine to give
Let me give right now to you

I don't know where we'll go
Or if the sun will even shine
Again before my very eye
All I know is I'm in love with you now
If we could see tomorrow somehow
We will awake to another day
And I will walk you by my side

Let me give right now to you
Tomorrow may not ever come
(Hey, yeah)
Let me give right now to you
Tomorrow may not ever come
Let me give right now to you

Ooh-ooh-ooh, mm-mmm-mmm...
Let me give right now to you
