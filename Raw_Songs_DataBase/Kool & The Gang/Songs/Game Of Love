If you've never been hurt
Then you've never been in love before
If you've never felt pain
Then you've never played the game
The game of love

Two people in two places
Their hearts are being wasted
'Cause each is afraid to try

Now it's time to take some chances
To find out what romance is
All you have to do
Is tell the one you need
How much "I really love you"



But you keep hesitating
Afraid hearts will start breaking
And you'll be left alone

You will never find out
Why your mind has its doubts
The world of love calls you
To fall into the arms of someone who really loves you
