I wanna live in a world full of peace
The color of skin it just don't matter
Let's get along and let's get better
I want a life full of love, full of peace
Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness

In the air there's no pollution
No oil spilling in the ocean
So today I made the motion
Just a crazy notion I was hoping
For a world full of inclusion
Let's uphold The Constitution
Bring an end to all the confusion
And know that love is the only solution

We need more Lennons, Lincolns
More Kennedys and Kings
Lord could you send somebody to help us
Someone to help us with the dream
We need another Marley, a Gandhi
A preacher, a teacher
So I'm asking you today
Because the world we really need ya

I wanna live
I wanna live in a world that's full of hope and change
There's a brighter day
And I wanna go to a place called we the people
Where everyone's treated equal
Come on, let's go and live

Find a cure for all diseases
Put back all the broken pieces
Food and shelter for all the homeless
Give someone a hug in case they need it
You're my sister you're my brother
Let's take care of one another
And the Earth it is our mother
I don't wanna hurt her any further

We need more Lennons, Lincolns
More Kennedys and Kings
Lord could you send somebody to help us
Someone to help us with the dream
We need another Marley, a Gandhi
A preacher, a teacher
So I'm asking you today
Because the world we really need ya

And I wanna live in a world full of peace
If you do then pull up a seat

I wanna live in a world full of peace
The color of skin it just don't matter
Let's get along and let's get better
I want a life full of love, full of peace
Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness

What a difference one man can make and that one man starts with you
We shouldn't be treating each other harmfully, no
We have come too far to turn around so there just ain't no excuse
We all can live in peace and harmony oh, I wanna live

I wanna live in a world full of peace
The color of skin it just don't matter
Let's get along and let's get better
I wanna live in a world full of peace
Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness

I wanna live in a world full of peace
I'm gonna fight for the right
I want a life full of love full of peace
Life liberty pursuit of happiness

I wanna live in a world full of peace
Come on all let's work together
We can get through the stormy weather
I wanna live in a world full of peace
Life liberty pursuit of happiness

I wanna live
I wanna live in a world that's full of hope and change
There's a brighter day
And I wanna go to a place called we the people
Where everyone's treated equal come on, let's go and live

And I wanna live in a world full of peace if you do then pull up a seat

I want the good life, no more living strife
I want the dog, the kids, the house, the wife
I wanna live in peace and tranquility
So please don't bring bad news to keep
'Cause everybody mad even the day's sunny
Pissed off, wrong thoughts, stressed out over money
They say it can't buy you love, yes it could
I see it going on around the world in every hood
How you living making bad decisions
I had you sketched out or stretched out, laid up in prison
You as small as you desire, big as you aspire
So let's get back on track, flat tire
Keith Murray pulling a game, was fucking with that
Fuck rap patso, mixed with rap
We bringing it back, we bridging the gap
Generation to generation, now that's the facts

And I wanna live in a world full of peace
You do then pull up a seat
