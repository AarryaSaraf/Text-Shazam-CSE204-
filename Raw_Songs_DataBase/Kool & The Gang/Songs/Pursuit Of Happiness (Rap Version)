I wanna live in a world full of peace
The color of skin, it just don't matter
Let's get along and let's get better
I want a life, full of love, full of peace
Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness

In the air, there's no pollution
No oil spilling in the ocean
So today I made the motion
Just a crazy notion, I was hoping
For a world full of inclusion
Let's uphold the constitution
Bring it into all the confusion
And know that love is the only solution

We need more Lennons, Lincolns
More Kennedys and Kings
Lord, could you send somebody to help us?
Someone to help us with the dream
We need another Marley, a Gandhi
A preacher, a teacher
So I'm asking you today
Because the world, we really need ya

I wanna live in a world that's full of hope and change
There's a brighter day
And I wanna go to a place called "we the people"
Where everyone's treated equal
Come on, let's go and live

Find a cure for all diseases
Heard back all the broken pieces
Food and shelter for all the homeless
Give someone a hug in case they need it
You're my sister, you're my brother
Let's take care of one another
And the earth, it is our mother
I don't wanna hurt her any further

We need more Lennons, Lincolns
More Kennedys and Kings
Lord could you send somebody to help us?
Someone to help us with the dream
We need another Marley, a Gandhi
A preacher, a teacher
So I'm asking you today
Because the world, we really need ya

And I wanna live in a world full of peace
If you do then pull up a seat

I want the good life, no more living strife
I want the dog, the kids, the house, the wife
I wanna live in peace and tranquility
So please don't bring bad news to keep
'Cause everybody mad even the day's sunny
Pissed off, wrong thoughts, stressed out over money
They say it can't buy you love, yes it could
I see it going on around the world in every hood
How you living making bad decisions
I had you sketched out or stretched out, laid up in prison
You as small as you desire, big as you aspire
So let's get back on track, flat tire
Keith Murray pulling a game, was fucking with that
Fuck rap patso, mixed with rap
We bringing it back, we bridging the gap
Generation to generation, now that's the facts

And I wanna live in a world full of peace
If you do then pull up a seat

And I wanna live in a world full of peace
The color of skin, it just don't matter
Let's get along and let's get better
I want a life, full of love, full of peace
Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness
