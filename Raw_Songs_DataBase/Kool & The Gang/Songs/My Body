When the sky turns to black
All of a sudden I get that love attack
Without warning it says "Hello"
It tells me that my sea is stormin'

I rub my hands up and down your spine
Gotta let you know what's on my mind
Lady, turn yourself around
And give your love to me


My Body, Body, Body, Body
Wants your Body
My Body, Body, Body
Needs you
My Body, Body, Body, Body
Got to have your Body
My Body, Body, Body
Is Taylor made for you

On the beach - hangin' out
Even at a party - Girl you turn me out
It doesn't matter where we go
When I get the feelin'
I've gotta let it show

I rub my hands up and down your spine
Gotta let you know what's on my mind
Lady, turn yourself around
And give your love to me



Girl, let's take this ride
Into the sunset, gonna make you sweat
Lady, hold on tight - Get into the motion
The motion baby
