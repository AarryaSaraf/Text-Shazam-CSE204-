Summer, mercury is high
Hangin' with my baby
Love is on my mind
Jeep style, music pumpin' high
Everybody's dancin', stars are in the sky

It's a beautiful night in the hood
I'm feelin' good
Coolin' with the ladies
The way that we should
And I know that it's gonna be
All right tonight, yeah

Hangin' out in the hood tonight
Doin' it 'cause it feels so right
Hangin' out in the hood tonight
Doin' it 'cause it feels so right

People come out to play
Brothers and Sisters from around the way
Jeep style, music pumpin' strong
Everybody's chillin' all night long

It's a beautiful night in the hood
I'm feelin' good
Coolin' with the ladies
The way that we should
And I know that it's gonna be
All right tonight, yeah

Hangin' out in the hood tonight
Doin' it 'cause it feels so right
Hangin' out in the hood tonight
Doin' it 'cause it feels so right

Hangin' out in the hood, feeling good
Hangin' out in the hood, feeling good

Hangin' out in the hood tonight
Doin' it 'cause it feels so right
Hangin' out in the hood tonight
Doin' it 'cause it feels so right

It's a beautiful night in the hood.
I'm feelin' good
And I know that it's gonna be
All right tonight, yeah
