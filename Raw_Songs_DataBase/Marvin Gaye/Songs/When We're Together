 Just a simple movie matinee 
 Yeah baby, or sittin' across from you at a cafe 
Hey hey oh, it's such a special special treat 
 Each moment breathlessly sweet 
 That's the way it is when we're together 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

 Even when we casually roam 
 Oh baby, down by the countryside & back home 
It seems to make up for the time we spend alone 
 Oh Marvin, when I talk with you 
I'm lookin' forward to 
 When we're together 
 Baby, when we're
 together 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

 Oh there's a smile on my face 
That Old Man Trouble can't erase 
 That's the way it is when we're together 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah

 Oh baby
 when we're together 
 I like it, ooo yeah 
That's the way it is
 when we're together 
 Darlin', darlin', you're the apple of my eyes
