 All I can say is you held me tight
Just give me more, more, more, more kissin', baby
More, more, more, more huggin', honey
I just can't get enough of your sweet lovin', oh it's so good
It makes me wanna love you like a lover should

 Oh give me more, more, more squeezin' baby
I want more, more, more teasin', honey
I just can't get enough of your sweet lovin', it's so good
It makes me wanna love you like a lover should

 My mama told me "Girl"
She said "Men won't do you nothin' but harm"
 Oh Tammi, what Mama don't know is
How good it feels when you're in my arms

 I want more, more, baby
More, more, more, more, more
 I just can't get enough of your sweet lovin', & oh so good
It makes me wanna love you like a lover should


So give me more, more, more kissin', baby
More, more, more huggin', honey
More, more, more squeezin'
More, more, more teasin'

So give more, more, oh baby
Just a little bit more, oh yeah
Baby, gonna take me more, oh baby
Just a little bit more, ooh yeah
Teeny bit more...
