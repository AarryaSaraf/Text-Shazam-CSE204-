You know, I hear this is going out
Of the album, all over the side to the b-side, to the outer side, you know?
This is a strange thing, let's see what happens

Making light
Yo mum said, if you didn't understand it
You could take your time and try gettin' it right
Now baby, dance, step a little closer
You've got to feel it, so baby, let it move
You take a little time, you get out, now
Now, don't you know you sure won't be no fool?
Can't help it
The reason is because, you see, we're nice
But are on the road to life, you longing
You'll find a better time, take advice
Now work it out, friends understand
The groove is 'cause you want to make it right
You shakers huff or puffin' all your troubles
Get in the move and, and start tonight
I see myself and though you must believe
And take a little hint from 
Just let your hips-a loose and start to move
