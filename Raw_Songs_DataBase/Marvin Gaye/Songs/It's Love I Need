Got an awful hurt in my lonely heart
It's about to drive me crazy since we've been apart
I've seen seven doctors but they can't help me
They said that I'm in trouble
And it's love I need

Since you've been gone
It's been so lonely
You got the love I need
You and you only
Oh baby

Darling, doctors can't help me
Love I need
Going crazy
Love I need
You can save me baby
Love I need

Can't go on, in this loneliness
When you took your love, you took my happiness
All these tears in my eyes won't let me find my way
And this aching in my heart is growing every day

C'mon home
It's so lonely
You got the love I need
You and you only
Oh baby

It's love I need
Darling, doctors can't help me
Love I need
I'm going crazy
Love I need
You can save me, darling
Love I need

Got an awful hurt in my lonely heart
It's about to drive me crazy since we've been apart
I've seen seven doctors but they can't help me
They said that I'm in trouble
And it's love I need

Since you've been gone
It's been so lonely
You got the love I need
You and you only
Oh baby

Love I need
Doctors can't save me
It's your love I need
And I'm going crazy
I need your love
