(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm yours (I'm yours)
And you're mine (You're mine)
You are mine (You're mine)
Baby, I'm yours (I'm yours)
And nothing's gonna ever, ever, ever
Ever come between us

I'm yours (I'm yours)
You are mine (You're mine)
You are mine (You're mine)
And I'm yours (I'm yours)
And nothing's gonna ever, no, no, baby
Ever come between us

I'm so glad I found you
A-let me put my arms around you
Whenever you are near
There's a heaven on earth
Right here, right here

I'm yours (I'm yours)
You are mine (You're mine)
You are mine (You're mine)
And I'm yours (I'm yours)
And nothing's gonna ever, no, no, baby
Ever come between us

Hooooo! Hoooo!

Hey, baby, I'm so glad I found you
Let me put my arms all around you
Whenever you are near
I said heaven's on earth
Right here, right here

I'm yours (I'm yours)
You are mine (You're mine)
Oh, baby (You're mine)
And I'm yours (I'm yours)
Nothing's gonna ever, no, baby
Ever come between us
Said nothin', no, nothin'
Will ever come between us
Said nothin, no, baby beiween us
All because I'm yours...
