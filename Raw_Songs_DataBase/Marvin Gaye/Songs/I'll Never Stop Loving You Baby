 There's a spark inside my heart
That sets my soul on fire & keeps the flame inside me
I love it, Marvin
 Baby, just like the glow from out the night
When you're near, I feel all right
Somethin' inside me keeps me yearnin', ooo baby

 I'll never stop lovin' you baby, no no no no
 I'll never stop lovin' you, Marvin, no no no no

 Near to you, I'm sure I'll rhyme
Every dream that's passed through my mind
Simply because your love makes me believe
 Near to you, I feel so strong
& I know I can right any wrong
Lovin' you gives me the power that I always need

 I'll never stop lovin' you baby, no no no no
 I'll never stop lovin' you, Marvin, no no no no

 Baby, tell me baby
 Oh baby, right from the start, you showed you cared
Every moment that we ever shared
Has brought me one step closer, oh to you
 That one day, honey, since we met
Have you surely one reason to regret?
Givin' my love to you, dear

 I'll never stop lovin' you baby, no no no no
 I'll never stop lovin' you, Marvin, no no no no
 Tammi, I'll never stop, stop
 No no no no
 I'll never stop lovin' you, no no no no
