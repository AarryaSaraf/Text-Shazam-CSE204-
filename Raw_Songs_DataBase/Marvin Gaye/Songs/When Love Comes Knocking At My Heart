 Ooo here I am alone, thinkin' aimlessly
Seein' other girls in love & wishin' it were me
If I could only find the key & make love come my way
I would trade this loneliness for true love any day

 When love comes knockin' at my heart
I'm surely gonna let it in
When love comes knockin' at my heart
Happiness will surely begin
 Oh darlin',  Oh darlin'
 Oh darlin',  Oh darlin'

 Emptiness is in the air & all around me gloom
As I gaze through the window of my lonely room
I hate to get up in the mornin' 'cause I know what lies ahead
Where there should be a cheerful smile, there's loneliness instead

 When love comes knockin' at my heart
I'm surely gonna let it in
When love comes knockin' at my heart
Happiness will surely begin

 Oh if you've never been in love, darlin'
Then you're just like me, now
 Don't you get lonely? What am I to be?
Oh darlin',  Oh darlin'
 Oh darlin',  Oh darlin'
 Oh darlin',  Oh darlin'
 Oh darlin',  Oh darlin'

 My heart's full of envy for the girl who lives next door
She has so many things that I've never had before
 She possesses one thing I've never had a chance to get
That's someone to call her own & there's one thing you can bet

 When love comes knockin' at my heart
I'm surely gonna let it in
When love comes knockin' at my heart
Happiness will surely begin
 Oh darlin',  Oh darlin'
 Oh darlin',  Oh darlin'

 When love comes, I'm gonna let it in
Because I know I'll be happy then
Loneliness will be no more
When love comes, gonna open that door
When love comes, when love comes
Oh darlin', when love comes
