 How you gonna keep it after get it?
 I wanna know, sugar darlin', yeah
 How you gonna keep it after you get it?
 Oh baby, 
 Sweet thing

 Now I think of games sometimes
But when it comes to this heart of mine
I don't miss a bus
If you ain't got the right stuff
So I'm laying it on the line
& it's somethin' you'd best be mine
Don't fight the fire without the words to give it up

 Oh how you gonna keep it after you get it?
 Oh tell me sugar, tell me sugar
 How you gonna keep it after you get it?
 I wanna know right now

 Listen, your sweet talkin' sure sound good
& your kissin' satisfied
& when you hold me in your arms
I get weak, I won't deny
But I'm not in for a one-night thrill
You've got to have enough love to pull us all over the hill

 Oh how you gonna keep it? 
 I wanna know
BOTH: How you gonna keep it?
 I want you to think, think about it baby
Stop & start yourself
Don't let your mind ruin my heart
 Is what you're layin' on me fake
Or have you really got what it takes?

 Oh how you gonna keep it? MG: I wanna know
 How you gonna keep it?
 If I let you be careful with my ship
 How you gonna keep it?
 I wanna know, will you be able to hold your grip?
 How you gonna keep it?


How you gonna keep it? ...
