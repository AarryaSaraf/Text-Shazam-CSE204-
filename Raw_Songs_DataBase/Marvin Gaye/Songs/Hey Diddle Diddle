Hey Diddle Diddle
Love me just a little
Please baby say you will
Little boy blue
That's me without you
'Cause you know how you make me feel

C'mon and love me
C'mon and love me baby
C'mon and love me, baby
C'mon and love me baby

Just like an apple
Hanging on a tree
Won't you come by and pick me off

Please don't wait too long
Pretty soon I might be gone
I might fall off and I'll be lost

C'mon and love me
C'mon and love me baby
C'mon and love me
C'mon and love me baby

Hey Diddle Diddle
Love me just a little
Please baby say you will
Little boy blue
That's me without you
'Cause you know how you make me feel

I'm in misery
From this tortury
Won't you look in my eyes and see
That I'm in distress
From this loneliness
Truly your love is what I need
Oh
Oh baby

Just like
Over on the corner
About to get down on my knees
Beggin' Mary, Mary
Don't be contrary
Give my heart all the love it needs

C'mon and love me
C'mon and love me baby
Put it on me, baby
Put it on me, baby

Hey Diddle Diddle
Love me just a little
Please baby say you will
Little boy blue
That's me without you
'Cause you know how you make me feel

Like jello on a plate
I shiver and I shake
Every time that you come near
Hey Diddle Diddle
Love me just a little
