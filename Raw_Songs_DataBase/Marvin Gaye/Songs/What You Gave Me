 Like a breath of spring you came
& as you leave, I can only sigh your name
Cries of anguish echo from way down
But will never reach my lips to make a sound
Though it seems my world is crumblin'
Honey, you don't owe me anything 'cause
 What you gave me is more than enough to last
& what you gave me is more than enough to last

 You've given me so much warmth
I don't see how I could ever grow cold
In my room there's a picture of you & I
That nobody has a price to buy
I don't know what made you change your mind
But you'll be back, it's just a matter of time
 What you gave me is more than enough to last
What you gave me is more than enough to last

 Into my life you came like a breath of spring
Given me a song to sing
 Oh yeah, 
 Oh yeah
 & though I know you're leavin'
I won't be grievin' 'cause I know
 Time has a way of showin' us
the things we really need
& no matter where you go
I know you'll find your way back home
 Oh baby, though I know it's not reality
You'll always be a part of me
 'Cause what you gave me is more than enough to last
& what you gave me is more than enough to last

 I'm gonna live once again
 What you gave me, 
 is more than enough to last
 I love you, I love you
 Hey now, & what you gave me is more than enough to last
& what you gave me is more than enough to last
