Baby if you're walking down on a one way road
And heartaches are your heavy load
Don't you let it get you down
It's time to start looking around
And if you're looking for sincerity
C'mon girl look at me
If love's treated you unkind
I'm gonna make things right this time

If your poor heart has turned cold
C'mon
C'mon try my true love
If things got out of control
Baby try my true love

Honey don't lock your heart inside
A heart should always feel alive
With happiness flowing free
Full of love and never, never empty

So leave all the doubt behind
Reach out for love, try to find
Don't look back and be misled
Take my hand, future lies ahead

Oh baby
If you're looking for love and can't find it
C'mon try my true love

Don't let happiness pass you by
Take a step forward baby
You got to try
Honey you got to try

Put your heart in my hand
And I'll help you to understand
That darkness can be the light
If you go about it right

There's no need to be apart
I'll be waiting with open arms

If you leave past behind you
C'mon try my true love
If you're looking for love and can't find it
C'mon try my true love
If you are walking down a one way road
C'mon try my true love
