I'm goin' to Chicago
That's the last place my baby stayed
(Hitch hike) Yeah, hitch hike, baby
I'm packin' up my bags
Gonna leave this old town right away
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike (Hitch hike, baby)
I've got to find that girl
If I have to hitch hike 'round the world
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike

Hmmm, Chicago City Limits
That's what the sign on the highway read
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike (Hitch hike, baby)
I'm gonna keep movin'
Till I get to the street corner 6th and 3rd

I've got to find that girl
If I have to hitch hike 'round the world
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike, baby

But my next stop just might be L.A.
(Hitch hike) Now what'd I say (L.A.)
Got no money in my pocket
So, I'm gonna have to hitch hike all the way
