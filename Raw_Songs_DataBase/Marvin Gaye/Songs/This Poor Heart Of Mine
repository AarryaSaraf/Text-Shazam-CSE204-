 Ooo heartburn, cold chills
Dizzy spells, I bite my fingernails
I don't think I'm gonna pull through
Everything depends on you
Only your love can save this poor heart of mine
Situation: desperate; honey, save this poor heart of mine

 Oh dark days, empty nights
Without your arms to hold me tight
I don't know how long I'm gonna last
So come back baby, I'm sinking fast
Only your love can save this poor heart of mine
Situation: desperate; baby, save this poor heart of mine

 Baby, you left me in a burning condition
 And my love, to you, has become my affliction
 Ooo you know my need for you
Is oh so strong it's like fire set up in my bones
Only your love can save this poor heart of mine
Situation: desperate; baby, save this poor heart of mine

 Oh I don't think I'm gonna pull through
 Everything depends on you


 Only your love can save this poor heart of mine
Situation: desperate; honey, save this poor heart of mine
