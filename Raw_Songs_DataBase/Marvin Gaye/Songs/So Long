You got me skipping around
Thinking down
Searching all over town
Try to keep my eye on you

You got me looking here
And looking there
Got me searching everywhere
Honey, why can't you be true

From me you get sweet satisfaction
In return I get no reaction
Your love for me girl is drifting away
So you're leaving me with nothing else to say

So long
I can't take it no more
So long
I'm walking out of the door
My loving you dragging me down
I got to save my heart
Got to get out of town

So long
Honey, honey, honey I'm even
So long now I'm leaving
It's gonna hurt me baby
I know that you
Tried to forsake my heart
There is nothing else I can do

You got a lot of nerve standing there
Tear all over your face
When you know darn well
That you'd do the same thing
Baby if you were in my place
You might as well dry your eyes
'Cause we both now you don't care
So I'm playing smart, packing up my heart
Honey, I'm leaving now
So long

So long
I wasted to much time
You treat our love like a one night stand
Honey you just lost one good man
So long
So long, bye bye baby
