Get closer to me
Love twins, love twins
Let's be love twins
Let's create a love that will never end
Let's show the world love can win, darling
I want you for more than just my friend
I love you, baby
I love you, too, Marvin
Because we've been friends for such a long time
For loving you has constantly been on my mind

And all I want, baby, from you
I want a lover, not a friend, yeah
Let's be love twins

Let's be as one, darling, yeah
Like the sign of the Gemini
Oh close together, you and I
Let people say you won't see
One without the other
Let 'em be aware that you and I are lovers

All I want, baby, from you
I want a lover, not a friend, yeah
Let's be love twins

Oh baby, come on in, love twins
Oh girls, let's walk together, yeah
Hand in hand
I'll be your woman, Marvin
If you'll be my man
Together I know we can make it
As lovers, not friends
Oh baby, come on, let's be love twins
Please, oh let's walk together

Let's be love twins, hand in hand
You'll be my woman and I'll be your man
Just we two, babe, honey, me and you
Together we can create
Something different, something new
Let's be love twins
Let's be love twins, sugar
