(Ow, yeah) Here they are all around me
Pretty girls everywhere (Everywhere)
I ain't got nobody, and I think it's so unfair (So unfair)
Patience is a virtue, that's what I've been told

But I got to get my hands on some lovin'
Before I'm too old (Before I'm old, too old, yeah, yeah)

I guess when I find the patience, between me, myself and I
Said I'm gonna walk to one of you foxy devils
Gonna take you by surprise (By surprise)
Said I got love in my soul (Got lovin', got lovin')
I'm gonna get more

'Cause I got to get my hands on some lovin'
Before I'm too old (Before I'm old)
Much too old (Too old, yeah, oh)

Got to get myself a woman (He's got to get himself a woman)
I said I need a woman (He's got to get himself a woman)
I need some lovin' (He's got to get himself some lovin')
Oh Lord, yeah (He's got to get some lovin')
Yeah (Yeah, oh)

Ah here they are all around me
Pretty women, pretty women everywhere (Everywhere)
And I ain't got nobody, I think it's so unfair (So unfair)
Patience, patience is a virtue, that's what I've been told

But I got to get my hands on some lovin'
Before I'm too old (Before I'm old)
Before I'm much too old (Before I'm old, yeah)
