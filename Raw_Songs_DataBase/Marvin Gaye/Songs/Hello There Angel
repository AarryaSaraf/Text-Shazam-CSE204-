Right around the corner, oooh
(There lives an angel) Angel (An angel)
And how I hope and pray
I'll make her my girl
So, if I had wings of gold
I'd fly to you, my love, yes, I would
And on my way to you
I'd catch a star from above
Straight away I'd fly to cloud number nine
See, if my baby was feelin' fine
When I get there
This is what I'd say

(Hello there angel) Hello there angel
Are you feelin' fine today
I happened to be in the neighborhood
Thought I'd fly around your way to say
Angel love (Angel love)
My darlin' angel (My darlin' angel)
Can you come out to play (Hello there angel)
Come on, angel (Hello there angel) Please

I really love you

Now right around the corner
There lives an angel (An angel)
Now if Venus only knew
Oh, how she'd envy you, yes, she would
The beauty of your love
Shines through and through
And oh, oh, without you I know
My world would come to an end
But I've got you right beside me
With each day a new dawn begins

(Hello there angel) Hello there angel
Are you feelin' fine today
I happened to be in the neighborhood
Thought I'd fly around your way to say
Angel love (Angel love)
My darlin' angel (My darlin' angel)
Can you come out to play (Hello there angel)
Come on, angel (Hello there angel) Please

Oh, walkin' with your halo on
(Hello there angel) Hello angel
(Hello there angel) Yes, darlin'
Oh, I want to take you home...
