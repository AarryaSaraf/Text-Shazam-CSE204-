Someone is friendless and cannot find their way
So I'll, keep my light in my window
I want to be there to help restore their faith
So I'll, keep my light in my window
Born of God's mercy
I'd be in their place
So I'll, keep my light in my window

So I can ease the pain that life can bring
Help them find a peace their spirit needs
I have been chosen for a work to do
To make a world of love for me and you

Some call me foolish to lend a helping hand
But I'll, keep my light in my window
I feel so good when I help my fellow man
So I'll, keep my light in my window
Till love and mercy shine throughout the land
I gonna keep my light in my window

'Cause I wanna ease the pain that life can bring
I help you find the peace your spirit needs
I have been chosen for a work to do
To make a world of love for me and you

'Cause I wanna ease the pain that life can bring
And help you find the peace your spirit needs
I have been chosen for a work to do
To make a world of love for me and you

I wanna ease the pain that life can bring
Help you find the peace that your spirit needs
I have been chosen for a work to do
To make a world of love for me and you

I wanna (ease the pain that life can bring)
(Find the peace your spirit needs)
(Chosen for a work to do)
(World of love for me and you)
(Ease the pain that life can bring)
(Find the peace that your spirit needs)
(Chosen for a work to do)
(World of love for me and you)
(Ease the pain that life can bring)
I help you find the peace your spirit needs
I have been chosen for a work to do
To make a world of love for me and you
I wanna (ease the pain that life can bring)
(Find the peace your spirit needs)
(Chosen for a work to do)
