Oh my love if you'll 
Have a little trust, just a little trust 
In me, oh I'll come through 
I know I haven't been good to you 
So give a little love, just a little love 
To me & I'll be true 
 To you, 
 You

 Have a little faith, just a little faith 
In me & I will do 
The things I should for you 
Give a little love, just a little love 
To me & I'll be true 
 To you, 
 You

 I know I've strayed far far away from your arms 
Yeah baby, just like a fool 
 I hope & I pray that you'll let me return 
So I can make love, make love, make love to only you

 Oh my love, if you'll 
Have a little trust, just a little trust 
In me, oh I'll come through 
I know I haven't been good to you 
So give a little love, just a little love 
To me & I'll be true 
 To you, 
 You

 Have a little faith, just a little faith 
In me & I will do 
Give a little love, just a little love 
To me & I'll be true 
Have a little trust, just a little trust 
In me, oh I'll come through
