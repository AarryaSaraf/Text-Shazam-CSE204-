Every time I see you, I'm spinning like the tops
Intoxicated lady, what you doing? Don't you stop
Every time you pass me by I see Heaven in yo' eyes
All at once I'm hypnotized by your sweet and charming smile
Oh
You're what's happening in the world today

In my sleep I see you, darling, and you're lovely as a queen
Intoxicated lady, you bring joy to my dreams
Every time you pass me by I see Heaven in yo' eyes
All at once I'm hypnotized by your sweet and charming smile
Hey
You're what's happening in the world today, oh baby

You're like a drink of something that's much too much
And get a kiss from you, it thrill me through and through
Now I don't know for sure but I think you'd like it too
Cause, oh little baby, you're what's happening in the world today
I said, baby

You should be in movies, in a fashion magazine
Any king would be so proud just to have you for a queen
A leading lady is what you are, girl you sho' nuff a star
You shall receive an award for the part you play in my heart
Oh little baby, you're what's happening in the world today
Oh baby, little darling
I know, I know
Don't my mama, don't tell father
No, no
Oh honey, baby
