 My lovin' heart would shake 
More than the earth could break 
If you should ever go 
You know my heart would break 
 If I lost your sweet embrace 
Even time could not erase 
The memories of you 
Tears would cover up my face

 
 Oh how I'd miss you, baby 
 I need you so 
 Oh how I'd miss you 
 Baby never go 
 I'll never leave

 My world would cease to be 
Without the love you give to me 
The chains around my heart 
Would never set me free 
 When my life had just begun 
My sky didn't have a sun 
You fill my every need 
So if you ever leave

 


(Oh how I'd miss you, baby baby)

(Oh how I'd miss you, baby baby)


 Oh you're always on my mind 
Losin' you would leave me blind 
Fill my heart forevermore 
Never leave my love behind 
 With the joy your love can bring 
To you I'll always cling 
If you took away your love 
It would be the end of things, &...

 Oh how I'd miss you 
 Oh baby 
 Oh how I'd miss you 
 Marvin, I need you so 
 Oh how I'd miss you
