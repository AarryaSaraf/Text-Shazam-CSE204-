It don't take much
Don't take much
Yeah to keep me
No, not much

Just your touch
Just your tenderness
Just your sweet caress
Oh

Just the pleasure of your company
When I feel a little lonely, to comfort me
Just to to call you and know you are there
Take me through my day, oh without a care
If you worry about me leaving
Throw it out of your mind
Just as long as you want me I'll be right by your side

Oh, it don't take much
Just your touch
Yeah to keep me
Baby you got it
You got it baby
Got what it takes
It takes to keep me
To keep me

When the days go by and I don't see you darling
I might start to complain
But all you gotta do is talk to me sweet and plain
Let me know your love remains
Just say you need me, like I need you
That's enough to carry me through

You are my world
You are my everything
You're all my eyes can see
You're such a part of me

It's the little things you do
That keeps me loving you
It ain't what you do
It's the sweet way you do it
It ain't what you saying
Is the sweet way you're saying
Just let me know you're standing by
To what my eyes, I'll be satisfied

You are my world, you are my everything
You are all my eyes can see
Oh baby, you are such a part of me

Don't take much
No not much
Yeah to keep me
Baby you got it
I know you got it
You know you got it baby
Got what it takes
It takes to keep me
To keep me
Just your tenderness
That's enough baby
