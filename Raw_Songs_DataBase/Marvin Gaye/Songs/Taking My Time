Taking my time
Making up my mind
Choosin' the girl that's gonna have to love me forever
I wanna make sure
That she has a heart of gold, yeah
And a love to hold me forever, yeah

That's why I'm taking it slow
'Cause I wanna know
If it's the kind of love that's gonna last me forever
Don't wanna waste precious time by playin' the lover's part
'Cause I may wind up with a broken heart
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, not me (Not me)
Not me (Not me)
Not I (Not I) Oh (Not I) Not me

Do you believe
A wise man once told me a long time ago
If a woman don't love you, let her go
I don't need you, baby

That's why I'm taking it slow
'Cause I wanna know
If it's the kind of love that's gonna last me forever
Don't wanna waste precious time by playin' the lover's part
'Cause I may wind up with a broken heart
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, not me (Not me)
Not me (Not me)
Not I (Not I) Oh (Not I) Not me


Taking my time
Makin' up my mind
Choosin', choosin'
I said I don't want an untrue lover
Choosin'...
