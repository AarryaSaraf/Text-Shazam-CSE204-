Dreamed of you this morning
Then came the dawn and
I thought that you were here with me
If you could only see how much I love you
You'd want to trust me

(I was really lovin' you, baby) Oh, in my dream
(I was really lovin' you, baby) I was loving you
(I was really lovin' you, baby) Every place
(Really, really lovin' you, baby) That you wanted me to

(I'd like to do it now) Since I believe in dreams and fantasies
(I've got to give you everything)
I'd like to make love to you right there baby
Ooh, I've got this real strong need to love you everywhere
I won't stop until I find your passions flowing like wine
Baby, baby, please let me do it to you

(Oh no, I never gave up no head) I never, gave head before
But there's always the first time, you know
So I made up my mind (Come on baby, first time)
(Come on baby) Soon I'll be loving you
(Come on baby, come on baby) That's all I'm interested in
I've made up my mind
Soon I'll be loving you, girl I know what I'm gonna do

I can't wait to touch you, to give you that feeling
Eat you up my dear so that your mood will be revealing baby
And soon as I know I've got you willing baby

I'm going to give you some head baby
Giving up my life, keeping up the faith, that's what I'll do because I'm hung up on you (Gonna give you some head!)
I'm gone knock you right up woman

I'm going to give you some head, sugar, I know what to do
I want to give you some head, ah you big fine woman
Woo, I love to give it, baby, 'cause I know just what to do with it
Ah I'm going to give the ultimate love baby, the ultimate love baby
Don't you know I can handle you
Soon, soon, soon I'll be loving you, oh Janis
You're so fine, oh how I love you
