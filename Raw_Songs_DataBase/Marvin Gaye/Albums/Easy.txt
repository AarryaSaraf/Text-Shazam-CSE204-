// Baby, I Need Your Loving //

Baby, I need your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'

Although you're never near
Your voice I often hear
Another day, another night
I long to hold you tight
'Cause I'm so lonely

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Some say it's a sign of weakness
For a man to beg
Then weak I'd rather be
If it means havin' you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losin' sleep

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Empty nights echo your name
Whoa, sometimes I wonder
Will I ever be the same?
Oh yeah

When you see me smile, you know
Things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see
Has all been rehearsed

Darlin', I can't go on without you
This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside me, darlin'
Makes me feel half alive

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

// Good Lovin' Ain't Easy To Come By //

[Both:] Good lovin' ain't easy
Good lovin' ain't easy
Good lovin' ain't easy to come by
[Him:] Oh, darlin', that's the kind you offer me
It's just the love to be found
[Her:] 'Cause we're workin' on a buildin' nobody can tear down
[Both:] Look what we've got, ho-ho-ho-honey

[Both:] Good lovin' ain't easy
Good lovin' ain't easy, darlin'
Good lovin' ain't easy to come by, oh no no
[Him:] I've tried the good life and I know
It's a playground where no one cares
[Her:] But at last you'll find out that don't compare
[Both:] To what we've got, ho-ho-ho-honey

[Both:] It takes more than just a song and dance
You've got to work and fight to give it a chance
[Him:] If the rain comes down on us
And there ain't no place to run
[Her:] We'll just cover ourselves with a blanket of love
And wait till the mornin' comes
[Him:] Oh baby, let's do it today
[Her:] Inflection
[Both:] Give us protection

[Both:] Good lovin' ain't easy to come by
[Him:] Some think it's a plaything
You can toss away when it's old
[Her:] But when love's valued in pieces
It's worth more than gold
[Both:] That's what we've got

[Fading sequence:]
[Her:] Good lovin' ain't easy to come by
over [Him:] Oh, oh, it ain't easy

// California Soul //

Like a sound you hear
That lingers in your ear
You can't forget
From sunrise to sunset

It's all in the air
You hear it everywhere
No matter what you do
It's gonna get a hold on you

California soul
California soul

They say the sun
Comes up every morning
And if you listen carefully
The winds that ride
On the high tide
Whistle a melody

So the people started to sing
And that's how the
Surf gave birth untold to

California soul
California soul
When you hear the beat
You wanna pat your feet
And you've gotta move cause
It's really such a groove

Puts a brand new kind of
Thinking in your mind
And you can't go wrong
Cause you're happy all day long

California soul
California soul

They had the melody and the beat
But it still didn't seem complete
Until they saw two lovers kissing
They knew just what was missing

So happy they were
Rocking and reeling
Because that added
That loving feeling

To California soul
California soul

California soul
Now if they move you
Will it move you
It can groove, you, baby

California Soul now now now
California Soul, yeah
California Soul
Satisfaction, darling

// Love Woke Me Up This Morning //

[MG:] Love woke me up this morning feelin' fine

// This Poor Heart Of Mine //

[Him:] Ooo heartburn, cold chills
Dizzy spells, I bite my fingernails
I don't think I'm gonna pull through
Everything depends on you
Only your love can save this poor heart of mine
Situation: desperate; honey, save this poor heart of mine

[Her:] Oh dark days, empty nights
Without your arms to hold me tight
I don't know how long I'm gonna last
So come back baby, I'm sinking fast
Only your love can save this poor heart of mine
Situation: desperate; baby, save this poor heart of mine

[Her:] Baby, you left me in a burning condition
[Him:] And my love, to you, has become my affliction

[Him:] Everything depends on you

// I'm Your Puppet //

Pull the string and I'll wink at you, I'm your puppet
I'll do funny things if you want me to, I'm your puppet

I'll be yours to have and to hold
Darling you've got full control of your puppet

Pull another string and I'll kiss your lips, I'm your puppet
Snap your finger and I'll turn you some flips, I'm your puppet

Your every wish is my command
All you gotta do is wiggle your little hand
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet

I'm just a toy, just a funny boy
That makes you laugh when you're blue
I'll be wonderful, do just what I'm told
I'll do anything for you
I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet

Pull them little strings and I'll sing you a song, I'm your puppet
Make me do right or make me do wrong, I'm your puppet

Treat me good and I'll do anything
I'm just a puppet an you hold my string, I'm your puppet
Yeah, I'm your puppet

Walking, talking, living, loving puppet
I'm hanging on a string girl, I'll do anything now

I'm a walking, talking, living, loving puppet, and I love you

I'm a smiling happy face when you want me to
Even make you happy when you're feeling blue

// What You Gave Me //

[MG:] Like a breath of spring you came
& as you leave, I can only sigh your name
Cries of anguish echo from way down
But will never reach my lips to make a sound
Though it seems my world is crumblin'
Honey, you don't owe me anything 'cause
[BOTH:] What you gave me is more than enough to last
& what you gave me is more than enough to last

[TT:] You've given me so much warmth
I don't see how I could ever grow cold
In my room there's a picture of you & I
That nobody has a price to buy
I don't know what made you change your mind
But you'll be back, it's just a matter of time
[BOTH:] What you gave me is more than enough to last
What you gave me is more than enough to last

[BOTH:] Into my life you came like a breath of spring
Given me a song to sing
[MG:] Oh yeah, 
[TT:] Oh yeah
[MG:] & though I know you're leavin'
I won't be grievin' 'cause I know
[TT:] Time has a way of showin' us
the things we really need
& no matter where you go
I know you'll find your way back home
[MG:] Oh baby, though I know it's not reality
You'll always be a part of me
[BOTH:] 'Cause what you gave me is more than enough to last
& what you gave me is more than enough to last

[TT:] I'm gonna live once again
[MG:] What you gave me, 
[BOTH:] is more than enough to last
[MG:] I love you, I love you

// I Can't Believe You Love Me //

I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me
Anymore, not like before

Whenever we're together, not a word do you say
When I speak your name in the softest tone
It's as though I'm all alone that's why

I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me
Anymore, not like before

(I can't believe that you love me)
(I can't believe that you love me)
(I can't believe that you love me)
(I can't believe that you love me)
Anymore, not like before

You don't kiss me like you used to
You don't say those pretty words
There's no thrill in your kiss, there's no sincerity
I do believe you've gotten over me

I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me
Anymore, not like before

I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe you love me
No, I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me
Anymore, not like before

[MG:] I wanna know, sugar darlin', yeah
[BOTH:] How you gonna keep it after you get it?
[MG:] Oh baby, 
[TT:] Sweet thing

[MG:] Now I think of games sometimes
But when it comes to this heart of mine
I don't miss a bus
If you ain't got the right stuff
So I'm laying it on the line
& it's somethin' you'd best be mine
Don't fight the fire without the words to give it up

[BOTH:] Oh how you gonna keep it after you get it?
[MG:] Oh tell me sugar, tell me sugar
[BOTH:] How you gonna keep it after you get it?
[MG:] I wanna know right now

[TT:] Listen, your sweet talkin' sure sound good

I get weak, I won't deny
But I'm not in for a one-night thrill
You've got to have enough love to pull us all over the hill

[BOTH:] Oh how you gonna keep it? 
[TT:] I wanna know
BOTH: How you gonna keep it?
[TT:] I want you to think, think about it baby
Stop & start yourself
Don't let your mind ruin my heart
[MG:] Is what you're layin' on me fake
Or have you really got what it takes?

[BOTH:] Oh how you gonna keep it? MG: I wanna know
[BOTH:] How you gonna keep it?

// Satisfied Feelin' //

[MG:] Hmm hmm hmm hmm
[BOTH:] People are wonderin' about the change that's come over me
'Cause a smile upon my face is somethin' rare for them to see
But how can I tell someone else what I don't understand myself?
It's like heaven into the sunshine out of the glow, & oh baby
It's just a satisfied feelin', oh yeah, down in my soul

[BOTH:] Imagine something so strong
That keeps the world from doin' you wrong
It gives you power, it gives you drums
& there ain't nothin' you can't overcome
Like a puzzle when the pieces fit
I know that this is it
It's like watchin' a brand new day begin to glow, & oh baby
It's a satisfied feelin' set down in my soul

[BOTH:] & I don't know what it is about you
But I can't stand the thought of ever bein' without you
[MG:] So I'm gonna love you & never let you out of my sight
[TT:] 'Cause the way you make me feel has got to be right

[MG:] Baby, you know it's like a flame burnin' within
& I know people can see it from afar
[TT:] Oh it gives you a special somethin'
That makes you wonder who you are
[BOTH:] If we had words, we could tell it all
The joys big & small
But I'm afraid the love we got can never be told
Oh baby, it's just a satisfied feelin' down in my soul
