// (I'm Afraid) The Masquerade Is Over //

Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine

I'm affraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, my darling and so is love

Your words don't mean what they used to me
They were once inspired, now they're just routine

I'm affraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, my darling and so is love

I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci and get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci with tears in my eyes
You look the same
You're a lot the same
But my heart says "No, no, you're not the same"

I'm affraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
So is love, the masquerade is over
So is love

// My Funny Valentine //

My Funny Valentine,
Sweet comic valentine -
You make me smile, with my heart.

Your looks are laughable
Un-photagraphable
Yet you'r my fav'rite work of art.

Is your figure, less than greek
Is your mouth, a little weak?
When you open it to speak,
are you smart?

But don't change a hair for me,
Not if you care for me -
Stay little Valentine, stay
Each Day is Valentine's Day.

[musical interlude]

Is your figure, less than greek
Is your mouth, a little weak?
When you open it to speak,
are you smart?

Don't baby don't change a hair for me,
Not if you care for me -
Stay little Valentine, stay
Each Day is Valentine's Day.

// Witchcraft //

Those fingers in my hair
That sly come hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft

And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do

'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what your leading me to

It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you

When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what your leading me to

It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you
There's no nicer witch than you

// Easy Living //

Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when youre in love
And I'm so in love
There is nothing in life but you

I never regret the years that I'm giving
They're easy to give when you're in love
I'm happy to do whatever I do for you

For you maybe Im a fool
But it's fun
People say you rule me with one wave of your hand
Darling, its grand
They just dont understand

Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love
There's nothing in life but you

// How Deep Is The Ocean? //

How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?
How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?
How far would I travel to be where you are
How far is the journey from here to a star?

And if I left you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean? how high is the sky?

// Love For Sale //

When the only sound on the empty street
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet
That belong to a lonesome cop
I open shop
When the moon so long has been gazing down
On the wayward ways of this wayward town
That her smile becomes a smirk
I go to work

Love for sale
Appetizing, young love for sale.
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled.
Love that's only slighty soiled.
Love for sale.
Who will buy?
Who will like to sample my supply?
Who's prepared to pay the price
For a trip to paradise?
Love for sale.
Let the poets pipe of love
In their childish way.
I know every type of love
Better far than they.
If you want the thrill of love
I've been through the mill of love.
Old love. New love.
Every love, but true love.

Love for sale.
Appetizing young love for sale.
If you want to buy my wares,
Follow me and climb the stairs.
Love for sale.

Love for sale

// How High The Moon //

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

// Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide //

Let your conscience be your guide, it won't lie to you
If you live as others do someday you'll be blue
I'll stop beggin' you to stay if you're dissatisfied
You can come or you may stay
Let your conscience be your guide

// You Don't Know What Love Is //

You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had to lose
You don't know what love is

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost
You don't know what love is

Do you know how lost I've been
At the thought of reminiscing
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

You don't know how hearts burn
For love that cannot live, yet never dies
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes
You don't know what love is

You don't know how hearts burn
For love that cannot live, yet never dies
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes
You don't know what love is, what love Is
