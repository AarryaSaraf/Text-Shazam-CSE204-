I think I really wanna go someday
I wanna fall in love in Montego Bay
I know my heart is wherever he may stay
I think I really wanna go someday
I wanna fall in love in Montego Bay
I know my heart is wherever he may stay

How's it feel to be on my mind?
I can't believe I found you in time
I had a dream across seas for you and me
Sun ray on my lap I love it on my back
Oh sweet bae holy sun
Oh future husband, undress me under the moon
Sweet bae someday will come soon

I think I really wanna go someday
I wanna fall in love in Montego Bay
I know my heart is wherever he may stay
I think I really wanna go someday
I wanna fall in love in Montego Bay
I know my heart is wherever he may stay


My lil' baby wanna smoke with me
Dread head in a party getting close to me
Said hol' up, slow up, roll up, roll up
Dance slow, baby, dance slow, baby smoke
Niggas off the gasoline
Smoking backwoods in the backwoods
Living lavishly
Ooh ooh, that's Mon-Montego Bay
I know my nigga like me
I know he cook his curry spicy
I know he eat me like I'm wifey
You know my hotel over pricey
So he gon' fuck me like I'm Oprah
Classy bitch only use a coaster
Now I'm swimmin in the money with a ducky too
Reading Toni Morrison in a nigga canoe
Cause a bitch really bout her freedom
Cause a bitch suckin dick in the new Adidas
And yes and yes, I'm problematic too
And yes and yes, I lick 'em up, oh yes I really do
Protection is a wave, wave cause we be open too
Jamaica thank you for my baby, I'm in love wit' you
