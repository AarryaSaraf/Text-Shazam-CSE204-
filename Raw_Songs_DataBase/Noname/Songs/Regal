May my road turn right
May my fists turn heaven
May the lord be with me
Made me look like reverend
Made me look like regal
Southside abandon
I swear I look so regal
I swear I look so regal
May my road turn right
May my fists turn heaven
May the lord be with me
Made me look like reverend
Made me look like regal
Southside abandon
I swear I look so regal
I swear I look so regal

Oh my baby got to know me
I'm looking like I'm the homie
I'm tatted from head to shoulder
I'm colder when he don't hold me
I'm warmer inside the casket
Basket to tie my hair
Africa's never dead, Africa's always dying
No more apples or oranges
Only pickles and pacifists
Twitter ranting for martyrdom unified as capitalists
Give 'em death be gone
Give 'em Tefflon Don
Give 'em Rice-A-Roni politics to bear more arms
And watch the bears come out
Yeah

May my road turn right
May my fists turn heaven
May the lord be with me
Made me look like reverend
Made me look like regal
Southside abandon
I swear I look so regal
I swear I look so regal
May my road turn right
May my fists turn heaven
May the lord be with me
Made me look like reverend
Made me look like regal
Southside abandon
I swear I look so regal
I swear I look so regal
