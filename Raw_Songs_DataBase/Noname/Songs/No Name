No name for people to call small or colonize optimism
No name for inmate registries that they put me in prison
I sewed the answers in linen
Dance em' under the thread
Pretend I'm riding in your cities when niggas scared of the feds
There's a ghost on my bike
City lay with a bullet
He wrote the scriptures for living in all the ways that he couldn't
Gave up the profit for pennies
No taste in mystery pudding
When labels ask me to sign
So my name don't exist
So many names don't exist
Welcome to Inglewood
And the trauma came with the rent
Only worldly possession I have is life
Only room that I died in was 25
What's an eye for an eye when niggas won't love you back?
And medicine's overtaxed
No name look like you
No name for private corporations to send emails to
Cause when we walk into heaven
Nobody's name gon exist
 off a joy nigga  radiates

You are the joy 
I've cared for where you came, the end
Your song, your truth, your light is proof
And love is still 

Don't let it pass you by
Don't let it pass you by
Your life, you life, is your life, baby
Don't let it pass you by
Don't let it pass you by
