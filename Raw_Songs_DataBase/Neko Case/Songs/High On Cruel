I shine like the sun

I'm on fire right now

Your tears have come too late

You break down the door

There's already nothing

I've only one heart to take

I've got all of what you're crying for now

Your tears have come too late

You break down the door

There's already nothing

I'd only one heart to break

You're crawling on the floor like a fool

And I'm so high on cruel

You'll drown in the light

And I'll burn like a star

Your tears are gonna give me fuel


Pray that your happy

And the years they fall away

Well, I've learned a lesson

So don't ask me to stay...
