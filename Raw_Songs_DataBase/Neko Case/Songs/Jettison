I didn't let go 'cause you hurt me

I didn't let go so you'd stay

I did let you go 'cause I love you so much

And it kills me to see us this way


Love saved my life when you found me

A debt I can only repay

By closing the doors, now I'm savin' yours

And I know that you want it this way


Sandman take me much further than sleep

We'll ride down that river of tears

Where only the stars and the angels will weep

As I jettison all of my years


Long are the nights I lay cryin'

Wasn't because you weren't true

I hope you can finally be happy my love,

'Cause I'd give up my own life for you


Sandman take me much further than sleep

We'll ride down that river of tears

Where only the stars and the angels will weep

As I jettison all of my years

Oh, I jettsion all of my years

Oh, I jettison all of my years
