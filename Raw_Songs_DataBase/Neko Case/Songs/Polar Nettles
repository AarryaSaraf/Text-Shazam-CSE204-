He takes his dinner in the bath 
Love sickened and infirmed 
The orderly found him there 
Fileted on the marble stairs 
Hat still in hand 
His smoking remains 
Blown out by a kiss from the Sunday scene 
Sunday soon Sunday soon someday soon 

Someday someday someday 

His eyes are closed his mouth has named her rosary her lips and tongue 
She is the centrifuge that throws the spies from the sun 
The cistine chapel dated with the gattling gun 
Someday soon 
Someday soon 
Someday soon 
Someday soon 


Oh the meadows set on him 
Move like starlings of the clearing and tenor of a foggy tongue 
The forcefield round his frosty hips 
Whose shape recalls the wicked spade 
That buried him but on his lips the last rites of man 
Someday soon
