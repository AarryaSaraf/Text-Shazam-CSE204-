I planned a dream inside a dream with your uncle
A fisherman who died
The oracle of the maritimes
Too cloudy to see fireworks
We would ride a chest of drawers into the waves
His granite hand held mine

I asked him how to tell you how much I could love you
'Cause I've never been so sure of anything

Sometimes I feel so beautiful, it's strange for a tomboy
Bruises up her legs, big hand holds my face
Sometimes I feel so ugly, I'm afraid
Worry nesting in my hair
Shedding like a Christmas tree
Surely there's a real woman coming to erase me

There's no way I could tell you how much I could love you
'Cause I've never been so scared of anything

And I'm not even wearing underwear
No exotic, I just forgot to
And I'm too much for people, so I gauge
And shout my thoughts here from a distance

That's no way to tell you how much I could love you
Though I've never been so sure of anything

Let go of my hand, and pass me an oar
The oracle of the maritimes
He said "Come on, sweet girl, let's find you an ocean
That goes with your eyes"
He said "Come on, sweet girl, let's find you an ocean
That goes with your eyes"
