Oh, shadowless
Let's get this done
Sandman is a-coming
But is taking to long
Gonna make your bed
Gonna smooth your brow
Call me from nowhere
When you're safe in a dream

You don't have to ask
Just focus past me
Out the back door
Shining new with dew
Upon the grass
Just focus past me
Idles a comet
Waiting for you

Oh, heart of sand
Mouth of glue
Don't know where you're going
But you're safe in a dream
Oh, shadowless
I'm just too small
To know where you are going
But I feel you still

Oh, shadowless
Let's get this done
Sandman is a-coming
But is taking too long

Oh, shadowless
Let's get this done
Sandman is a-coming
But is taking too long
