All night, all I hear, all I hear's your heart

How come, how come


I twisted you over and under to take you

The coals went so wild as they swallowed the rest

I twisted you under and under to break you

I just couldn't breathe with your throne on my chest


All night, all I hear, all I hear's your heart

How come, how come


So far under the bed

Into the beams you've gone

I've gone, you've gone


I'm wrapped in the depths of these deeds that have made me

I can't bring a sound from my head though I try

I can't seem to find my way up from the basement

A demon holds my place on earth 'till I die


All night, all I hear, all I hear's your heart

How come, how come


So far under the bed

Into the beams you've gone

I've gone, you've gone


All night, all I hear, all I hear's your heart
