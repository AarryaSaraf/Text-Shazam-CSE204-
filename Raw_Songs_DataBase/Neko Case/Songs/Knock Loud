Knock loud, I'm home

Just sleeping to pass the time

Wondering if you'll come by to visit me


Ten years have passed

Since you walked out of my life

But late last night in the pharmacy

You were in the line in front of me

So I ran away to hide


Knock loud I'm home

I wrote in black felt pen

Took that sign and taped it to the door


If you come in

To see how I have been

Make sure the door is closed behind you


Stand above me

While I poised do plunge

Through my heart attack

Kills the worst of me

Said I was sorry

Drink to forgive

I wake up alone

Knock loud I'm home
