One, two, three, four


Andy

The summer's over

I never noticed

Did you really think you'd leave so fast


This morning

Was feeling colder

One year older

Did you really think we'd feel so bad


Andy

It scares me sober

Think it's over

Did you really think we'd feel so bad

Did you really think we'd feel so bad


It helped me through the spring

Just to dream of what it might become

Woke up to find it'd been here and gone


Andy

Summer's over

I never noticed

Did you really think you'd leave so fast

Did you really think you'd leave so fast

Did you really think you'd leave so fast
