So sorry for the trouble
The times we've been afraid of each other
'Cause we didn't understand
All the spells we cast without trying
We pushed through

Shipwreck in my lap
Sorry stained my mouth gumball blue

Their damp bodies crammed in Times Square
I logged a furious path one hinted
To a hotel with no one waiting
But me and me and my whole life a fever and the phone
How was I to know
Sorry stained my mouth gumball blue

When strangers say, "I love you"
You're banished to a planet with no sounds
No sounds (no sounds)

But you come back for me
Sometimes only for your own peace of mind
Sometimes where there's smoke
There's just a smoke machine, honey
Honey

I've lived singing your songs
Long-legged mazes and English geometry
Daring not consider we were here
Should we break spells without trying
We cut our lasers short at cryin'
And kindly banish the soundless planet
Stain the edges of the nebula gumball blue

Another happy new year
Another happy new year
Another happy new year
Another happy new year
Another happy new year
Another happy new year
