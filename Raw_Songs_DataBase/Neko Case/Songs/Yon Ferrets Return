Welcome home, Blackfeet
To all the gophers you can eat
Seed like weeds across the prairie-o
Enjoy your time on the list,
Let us know that you'll be missed,
Cause people have a way of forgetting.
Cause people have a way of forgetting.

Welcome home, Blackfeet,
Come up from underneath,
Put some Al Green on the stereo
The air smells clear, you are the new pioneers
Of the Kansas territory-o

Now's your time, your approval rating is high,
Now's your time
