Voices that did comfort me

Are furthest from my sanity

And come from places I have never seen

Even in my darkest recollection

There was singin' my life back to me


The life you learn from someone else

That you can only trust yourself

Sometimes that is still too much to want


Gravity won't get you through the mazes

You can never travel by the way you've come


I could never choose the ones to love

And the ones who took the credit left me reelin'

But I owe much to the nameless and all those surrogates

Those who're singin' my life back to me


Life is not a constant thing

It's only made of short stories

I couldn't even tell you where I'm from

Guided by the voices I've deflected

Guided by electric wires' hum


I could never choose the ones to love

And the ones who took the credit left me reelin'

But I owe much to the nameless

Those who're singin' my life back to me


I see you in the future, skippin' time

While the eyes of all the faithful rest in peace

Yet tonight I see the highway

And someone singin' my life back to me
