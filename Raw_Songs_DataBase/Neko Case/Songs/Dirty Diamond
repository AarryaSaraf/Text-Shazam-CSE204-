Found these in a box at the bus stop
My name's at the bottom
But I'm nowhere to be found
I really get around they say

So I take these sightless creatures home
Then I fear them so to tremble
For I'm no mother, I
Just some random defender

I remember running chest high
In the steppe grass
At the dawn of man
When we got along

I remember running chest high
In the steppe grass
At the dawn of man
When we got along

We raced along the ground
I chased it out of town
The sun's the meanest easy target
That I know

We played a tender game
Of kissing cobra tag
We slipped astride our horses
Dry dust in their manes

My friend would touch my face
And leave a star or two
The years left constellations
Of our wild language

What drove the sun away
I'm far too small to know
A gaslight  that's free to march
Is only 

What can I tell you now
It's better way along the canal
Draw mosquito clouds
From the dens of hot tires for miles
Draw mosquito clouds
From the dens of hot tires for miles

I remember running chest high
In the steppe grass
At the dawn of man

I remember running chest high
In the steppe grass
At the dawn of man
When we got along

Oh, petroleum
You're the top predator now
Starving, lover, lier
But you're uninspired too
According to your anthem you

Oh, petroleum
You're the top predator now
And I am just desire
One dirty diamond
Some random defender

I sold my flesh that I might die
So the world will spin
And my cubs won't cry
I have to be the sun for them
Oh, petroleum
Ah, beautiful
But so am I

I'm the dirty diamond
Lying, looking at the sky
I'm the dirty diamond
Lying, looking at the sky
