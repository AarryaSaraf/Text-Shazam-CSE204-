My love was like a seed that you had planted

The root was not as strong as it could be

And as the years went on, you weren't enchanted

So you fell it like a great big tree


Now I'm falling timber

Timber the falling tree....


My heart was not a thing to take for granted

So loosen up your home and let me be

And if I had my way you would be planted

Drowning in the shade with me.


Now I'm calling timber...

Timber the falling tree-heeee.
