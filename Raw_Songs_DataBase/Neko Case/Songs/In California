In California I dream of snow

And all the places we used to go

With the night falling down

With the night falling down

Now I'm living in Korea Town

Waking to the sound of car alarms


I remember your face when I showed you the ticket

Said you were happy for me, your heart wasn't in it

Just a phone call away

Now there's nothing to say

As the days roll by, disconnected


In the land where the sun is always shining on

Crying alone, palm tress are laughing at me

Another fool playing songs that don't matter

For people who chatter endlessly


Another suicide on the 405

The Black Dahlia she's smiles and smiles

It's the same old town that bled her dry

One more starlet one more time

Bound to make it do or die

Talk a walk to Bonnie Brae

Try to wash these dreams away

They try to tell me L.A is beautiful when it rains
