Oh lie

I thought you were golden

I thought you were wise

Caught you returning

To the house you caught fire

But I know that I was your favorite

And I said Amen


Wise, found favorin' heaven

And I at your side

But I never felt sorry

For those shimmering lies

When I laid down and cried

I was faking

And I said Amen


Last night I dreamt

That I hit a deer with my car

Blood from his heart

Spilled out onto my dress and was warm

He begged me to follow

But legions of sorrow defied me


Oh lie

I thought you were golden

I thought you were wise

When I caught you returning

To the house you caught fire

But I know that I'm your favorite

And I said "Amen"

Oh favorite

And I said Amen
