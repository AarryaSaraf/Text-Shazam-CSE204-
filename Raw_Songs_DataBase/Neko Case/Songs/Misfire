Don't you misfire to fill me up
With the desire to carry on.
Don't you know honey that love's a game.
It's always hit or miss, so take your aim.
Gotta hold on tight,
Shoot me out of sight.
Don't you misfire to fill me up
With the desire to carry on
Your gun is loaded and pointed my way
There's only one bullet so don't delay
Gotta time it right
Fire me through the night
Come on, take your shot
Fire me higher
Don't you miss this time
Please don't misfire.
