There's a smell here that stands my hairs on end 

Dog hair in the heater, gas pumps and cedar 

And jackknifes on the nine 

And seabirds choked on fishing line 


Clouds are a hush but the chainsaws mush on to Custer and Columbia 

Salty tentacles drink in the sun but the red tide is over 

The mollusks they have won 


There's a smell here of gravel and cigarettes lit 

When the match made them sweet 

When the engine turned over and beat up our street 

Oh, that was the day 

To remember 


I remember because of the fires that leapt 

From the caves of the things that have not happened yet 

When I think of it now they smell to me quite sinister 


I want to go back and die at the drive in 

Die before strangers can say 

I hate the rain 

I hate the rain
