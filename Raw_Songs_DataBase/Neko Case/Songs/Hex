When you hear me calling your name in the night

Do you run to your window thinking a coyote might

Be howling

When you hear me knocking at your door again

Do you tell yourself it's only the wind

That's blowing

When you watch the sun sink down in the west

Do you tell yourself that the heart in your chest

Is still beating


Will you know or must I tell you

This is my lover's spell you have fallen into

My dear

My voice is all you'll hear

Only the sound of my heart pounding, darling

You took my heart

Cast it aside

Laughed when I cried

Like it was just no big deal

And here all alone in the dark

I know just how you feel


When you feel my fingers touch your skin again

Do you tell yourself there's just no use

In crying

When the stars in the sky begin to fade

Do you tell yourself, don't be afraid

It's just the night

That's dying


Will you know or must I tell you

This is my lover's spell you have fallen into, my dear

My voice is all you'll hear

Only the sound of my heart pounding, darling
