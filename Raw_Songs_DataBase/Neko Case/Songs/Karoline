Oh, the path you walk is on fire,

So wild and unashamed

With a passion you inspire

I'm gonna keep those men at bay


Cowgirl you've got that something

Of what all my dreams are made

So come on baby, just say the word,

I wanna be your slave


Yooooooo-ooooo-ooooo-oooo-ooooo.....


Oh the web you weave is so tender

I'm tangled by your gaze

And you know I need surrender

I never locked you in a cage


Cowgirl I've got that loving that puts all those men to shame

So come on baby, just say you will

Don't lay me in my grave


Yooooooo-ooooo-ooooo-oooo-ooooo.....


Oh, the path you walk is on fire,

So wild and unashamed

With a passion you inspire

I'm gonna keep those men at bay


Cowgirl you've got that something

Of what all my dreams are made

So come on baby, just say the word,

I wanna be your slave


Yooooooooooooooooooooooo

Oh, miss Karoline
