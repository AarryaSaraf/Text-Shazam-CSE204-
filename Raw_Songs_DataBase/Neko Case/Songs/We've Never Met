Oh my darling, oh my darling

How can you forget?

All the love we had between us

Now it's like we've never met


Oh it kills me, how it kills me

When I think I held you up

You were golden, I was blind

With your poison in my blood


Bittersweet are the memories

That make old lovers pine

But I'll trade all the memories

Just to have your heart in mine


Everybody's talking to me

But they just can't explain

Disappeared from all the pages

And nothing seems the same


Was a time I thought I knew you

When I looked you in the eye

Now the same eyes look right through me

You're too cool to see me cry


Bittersweet are the memories

That make old lovers pine

But I'll trade all the memories

Just to have your heart in mine


Oh my darling, oh my darling

How can you forget

All the love we had between us

Now it's like we've never met


You were golden and I was blind

Now it's like we've never met
