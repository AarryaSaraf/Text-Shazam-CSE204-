It's your bicycle bells
And your Rembrandt swells
You're children like
And still breathing
It's your look of loss
When you're coming across
Makes me feel like a thief
When you're bleeding

Duchess, Duchess
Light up your candles for me
Duchess, Duchess
Put all the love back in me

It's the Persian sea
Running through your veins
You shed your names
With the seasons
Still they all return
With there last remains
As they lay them before you
Like breezes

It's your shimmering dress
It says no
It says yes
It says I've nothing left for concealing
It's your shapeless flesh
And your old girl's grace
It's your young girl's face
That I'm breathing

Duchess, Duchess
Light up your candles for me
Duchess, Duchess
Put all the love back in me

I'm lying
She's crying
