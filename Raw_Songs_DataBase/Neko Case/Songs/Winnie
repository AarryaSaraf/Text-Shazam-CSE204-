I'm here to tell you a story
I'm here to tell you a lie
My poetry's weak and I know it
I was dropped at sad and crazy sometimes
So I fucked off, wayward canon to the sea
On land I was just an appetite
Of it started as a joke, now it ruled me
Sick on chronic mathematics
I just wanted to feel music

Her fever delivered me from the flue
The night hag's hands spread lovingly
Pulling the cape from the sunrise
And revealing a bank of warships called "she"s
Warlike then reckless, I realized
No weapons were drawn that I could see
Save the blazing stare of the captain
Who held lightning captive from her teeth

So I looked off the edge of the world
I saw the girl who changed everything
That's when I met Winnie
I wanted to be her sailor's tattoo
She sang me a song that was too sad for some
Struck up the band and filled up her lungs
Her mouth was sharp as the rib of a star
She told molting truths that would break our own hearts

We were warriors!
We clothed ourselves in the guts of our enemies
Who'd no respect for the wild
Warriors!
Long before hotwire safari park husbandry

And the joy ran through us like the weather's flux
We just wanted to be music
The joy ran through us like the weather's flux
We just wanted to be music

Her gravity pulled up my sad remains
Finger the curve of her cunning bow
I've loved you so long, Winnie
I want to be your sailor's tattoo
I've loved you so long, Winnie
Luring softly into you
