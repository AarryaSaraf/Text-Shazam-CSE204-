Lost love

You're the one that lies in my arms

You're the one that stole all my charms

I let you in


Misery

You took everything young from me

Burned it down right in front of me

My blood runs cold


Nobody said that love was gonna be kind

But they did say that it was pleasurable as it was divine


Lost love

You're the one that lies in my arms

You're the one that stole all my charms

I'm bought and sold


Nobody said that love was gonna be kind

But they did say it was pleasurable as it was divine


Wish I could leave it behind

Lost love
