These memories are bitter in mood
I'd cut them out myself if that were possible
Kind you cry yourself blind about
Kind that choke you out, choke you out

Had an uncle who was not by blood
Liked to scare all the little girls away
And if you're tenderhearted you should stop the tape
Snap the tape

He pulled the heads off of garter snakes
I cried so helpless for those dyin' creatures
You know I cried so hard I pissed myself
Twistin' away from the horror

In the dark at sea
Memories wear thick coats
The kind that pull you down
By refusin' to drown
You're choked under the shape
Of a sailor
A sailor

Deputized by the cruel god of children
No running water in his soul, just a hole
Echoed when he called your name from down the hall
His name was a command that cuts the ears off fightin' dogs
Then wipes the knife on his militia pants

Mercurochrome and merthiolate stains
Mercurochrome and merthiolate stains

And he's braggin' all the while
If I say that black is blue it's blue, black is blue if I say it is
Black is blue, black is blue if I say it is

I never wondered what made him that way
Bullies are not born, they're pressed into a form
And I hated those who gave him access to our days, the ones who did nothin'
I still can't love them

Mercurochrome and merthiolate stains
Mercurochrome and merthiolate stains

In the dark at sea
Memories wear thick coats
The kind that pull you down
By refusin' to drown
You're choked under the shape
Of a sailor
A sailor
A sailor

Mercurochrome and merthiolate stains
Mercurochrome and merthiolate stains
