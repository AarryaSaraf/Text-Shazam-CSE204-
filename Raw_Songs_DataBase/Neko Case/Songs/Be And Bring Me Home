If the way is clear my friend quick
If the way is clear my friend don't kick
Suddenly my fireplace is friendly
Bringing me home

Suddenly I may control
Take little things meaning big so's I'm not alone
Suddenly I'm not sick
Won't you be and bring me home

Be and bring me home
Be and bring me home
We can't roam
Be and bring me home

Her jewelry drops all its grime
Fed up crazy fanatics lose their crazy rhyme
We are ahead of time
All I can hear now is your chime
You find out that you is what is spoken for
You find out that you have no broken door
Nothing is known of where to go back for more
Like the waves are sparkling
Just like the diamond shores

Be and bring me home
Be and bring me home
We can't roam
Be and bring me home

You have your side, it's yours
Except for us if it's your pleasure
You can tap on my mind
You can play the cat jive
Someone was missing love
And now this someone is going home
I knew that you were missing
But I couldn't tell how
And I'm missing you
And me receives that we are not alone

Be and bring me home
We can't roam, no
Be and bring me home

They told me you were dirty
But I don't see no dirt
They told me you were strong
Funny I don't feel hurt
They said you were a criminal
No one sees no crime
They said I might need their dirty prisons
But I love the way you don't give me time

Be and bring me home
Be and bring me home
We can't roam, no
Be and bring me home

I don't care what they tell me
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think
I'll love my family always
Special and magical music
These are feelings from one to another
No foot moves through you trying for to kick
I won't jump on you though we are all rubber

Be and bring me home
Be and bring me home
We can't roam
Be and bring me home
