I'm a whole lot of big little girl
And I know what men like
But got bored 'cause here comes Ana
With a skirt harked up high
When you hold me tight and look into my eyes
I could sucker you into believing all of my lies

That's who I am, 1000% illusion
That's who I am, got you floating on a cloud
That's who I am, cookie cut for you love and reunion
Wanna make them sure you know
What you're getting yourself into now

I can be as nice as pie whenever I need to
But my hand in your front pockets
And tighten up your screw
Make you feel like a big man walking with your Barbie doll
Pull you down when you ain't around
And kick you when you fall

That's who I am, 1000% illusion
That's who I am, got you floating on a cloud
That's who I am, cookie cut for you love and reunion
Wanna make them sure you know
What you're getting yourself into now

I can laugh at all your jokes, particularly when it's you
Had better and I had worse, but I guess that you'll do
Don't try to boss me, you think I really care?
'Cause there's hundreds of boys waiting
Waiting for me out there

That's who I am, 1000% illusion
That's who I am, got you floating on a cloud
That's who I am, cookie cut for you love and reunion
Wanna make them sure you know
What you're getting yourself into now
