When she's on her best behavior

Don't be tempted by her favors

Never turn your back on mother earth


Towns are hurled from A to B

By hands that looked so smooth to me

Never turn your back on mother earth


Grasp at straws that don't want grasping

Gaze at clouds that come down crushing

Never turn your back on mother earth


Three days, two nights away from my friends

Amen to anything that brings quick return

To my friends, to my friends


I'll admit I was unfaithful

From now on I'll be more faithful


Never turn your back on mother

(Never turn your back)

Never turn your back on mother

(Never turn your back)

Never turn your back on mother earth

(Never turn your back)
