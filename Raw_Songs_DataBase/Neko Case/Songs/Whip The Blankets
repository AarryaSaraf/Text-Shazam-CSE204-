Well it's hot in the yard

And it's cool in the bed

And I whip the blankets into cotton thread

And I'll tear all the carpet up over my head

'Til my feet can go right through the basement


Well you play so surprised at what you have found

But I heard you coming from way across town

So let's get to getting to burning it down

And the fire, it's spreading like madness


'Cause I'm steeped in this pleasure

I've snapped from my tether

That the nation may vibrate apart

And you lead me again to the back of the line

And we'll work our way slow to the start


When the dishes are broken and the kitchen's a mess

I'm trapped in the door

Why don't you make me confess

'Cause I'm tastin' delicious

To just keep you guessin'

Whatever it is, that ignites me


'Cause I'm steeped in this pleasure

I've snapped from my tether

That the nation may vibrate apart

And you lead me again to the back of the line

And we'll work our way slow to the start

Yes we'll work our way slow to the start


When instinct is dirty and morality's clean

And we're bound for damnation say those magazines

Well to hell with the sorrow and watered-down scenes

We'll burn us a bridge straight to heaven.


'Cause I'm steeped in this pleasure

I've snapped from my tether

That the nation may vibrate apart

And you lead me again to the back of the line

And we'll work our way slow to the start

Yes we'll work our way slow to the start

Yes we'll work our way slow to the start
