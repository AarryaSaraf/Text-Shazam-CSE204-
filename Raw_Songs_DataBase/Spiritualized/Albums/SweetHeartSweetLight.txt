// Hay Jane //

Hey Jane where you goin' today?
You took a car then you ran all day.
That clock goin' 110. I never said I'd
get back again. Said I ain't got
time to make no mistakes. Ain't got
time to waste my brakes

Hey Jane where you goin' today?
Lit a fire then you fanned the flame.
They say you got a troubled soul.
I say you got it on a roll. You said
ain't got time to change your ways. 
Ain't got time to make no mistakes 
with you.

Show them what you can do. 

Hey Jane where you goin' today?
Ain't got lobe for you anyway. You
get so tired of hanging around. I'll
meet you there when you're comin'
down. Well you got good style and you 
a little taste. Carved your name
right into my face.

Hey Jane where you goin' today?
You broke my heart and you ran
away. Some say you got a rotten 
soul. But I said 'Janey loves rock 'n' 
roll.' Said you ain't got time, you're
a long time dead. Ain't got time to 
mess my head with you.

Hey Jane where you goin' today?
You hit the fast lane right away.
Got no breaks for your rotten life. 
A heart like yours never satisfied.
Said you ain't got time for such
a waste. You run so fast you get
no place.

Hey Jane where you goin' today?
I'll get a car for you right away. That
cop goin' 110. 'Fast lane' Jane said
'fast line, faster' Ain't got no time to 
make no mistake. Ain't got no time to
waste my time with you. 

Hey Jane where you goin' today?
Hey Jane where you goin' today?
Hey Jane where you goin' today?
Hey Jane where you goin' today?

Hey Jane where you gonna die?
Live life like a butterfly. Feel safe
baby by your side. Cheat death on 
another rid. Hey Jane where you
gonna die? You got wings like a 
butterfly. Meet death baby all
alone. 'Sweet Jane' on the radio.

Hey Jane when you gonna die?
That pain goes right inside. Hey 
Jane got a rotten soul. Hey Jane
got it on a roll. Hey Jane where
you going today? Sweet heart
and fade away.

Hey Jane when you gonna die?
Hey Jane when you gonna die?
Hey Jane when you gonna die?
Hey Jane when you gonna die?

Sweet heart, sweet light,
sweet heart and love of my life.

// Little Girl //

Sometimes I wish that I was dead
'Cause only the living can feel the pain
Sometimes I wish that I could fly
You get so grounded that life will pass you by

Hey little girl, we're on our own
Here today and then we're gone
Before we ride into the sun
Get it on

Sometimes your world's so full of pain
You get so hurt inside, but dry your eyes
Sometimes the words you gotta say
They get so trapped inside and fade away

Hey little girl, we're on our own
Here today and then we're gone
Before we ride into the sun
Get it on

// Get What You Deserve //

Gonna take more than I can borrow.
When I get there, won't look back.
Got more riches any man can hold.
Ain't gonna make for what I lack.

Used to care but I took care of that.
Used to slow but now I'm lightning.
Got a car all blue and red and white.
Gonna roll it where I like it.

Gonna shoot you while you're layin' down.
I lost all of my direction.
Gonna shoot you while your layin' still.
I used up all my affection.

Gonna take more, I don't borrow.
One more hit and I'll get high.
Get more twisted every road I take.
Ain't gonna stop until I die.

I used to love but I got love for that.
Used to know but now I'm blinded.
Got a child all full and fed and fat.
Gonna take him where I like it.

Gonna shoot you while you're layin' down.
I lost all of my direction.
Gonna shoot your while you're layin' still.
I used up all my affection.

Gonna take more than I can borrow.
When I get there, won't look back.
Got more riches any man can hold.
Ain't gonna make for what I lack.

Used to care but I took care of that.
Used to slow but now I'm lightning.
Got a car all blue and red and white.
Gonna roll it where I like it.

Gonna shoot you while you're layin' down.
I lost all of my direction.
Gonna shoot you while you're layin' still.
I used up all my affection.

Gonna shoot you while you're layin' down.
I lost all of my devotion.
Gonna shoot you while you're layin' still.
I lost all of my emotion.

Get what you deserve.
Get what you deserve.

// Too Late //

My momma said when she got so concerned
don't play with fire and you'll never get burned
don't touch the flame and you'll never find out
my momma said thats what loves all about

but its too late I've made up made mind 
love always shows when theres eyes that can blind
too late something I've learned
love like the flame

my moma said if you cant find a friend 
don't get to close cause you know it may end
don't get to deep cause you know you'll regret
heart ache and pain in love thats what you get

but its too late I've made up made mind 
love always shows when theres eyes that can blind
too late some thing I've learned
love  lights the flame when theres hearts that get burned

this is dedicated baby
what more can I say
I wont love you more that I love you today
and I wont love you less but I've made my mistakes
stay away from love dear if thats what it takes

but its too late I've made up made mind 
love always shows when theres eyes that can blind
too late something I've learned
love  lights the flame when theres hearts that get burned

too late, too late I've made up made mind 
love always shows when theres hearts that can break

// Headin' For The Top Now //

We should be headin' for the top now
We've have a hundred thousand years
We should've found a little heaven in our soul
That should've washed away the tears
Instead we're wasted all the time
And there's a thousand ways to cry
And in our haste to find a little more from life
We didn't notice that we'd died
And we'll be losin' all the time
We'll be choking back the tears
And we'll be seein' only white light in our mind
And it's been blinding us for years
She got a rhythm in her soul
She got a rainbow in her eyes
She gotta little bit of hurtin' deep inside
And its hurt you're gonna try

And I've been shooting up my time
I've been holdin' down the fear
We should be headin' for the top now little child
But I've been rotting here for years
And we'll be calling the dark
I'll be holding back the shame
We should be headin' for the top now little child
But she'll be dancing on your grave
And I'll be calling for a god
I'll be calling out for more
And I've been given all the riches in my heart
That she'll be selling at the door
She got a heavy duty soul
She got a twinkle in her eye
And she's polluting all the air waves with her song
And it's a song I'm gonna buy

And then she comes into my room
She caught me messin' on the floor
She got a little bit of heaven in her soul
That got me crawlin' back for more
She got a rumour in her heart
She got a twinkle in her eye
She got a little bit of hurtin' deep inside
And it's a hurt I'm gonna try
But her ambition's such a drag
She made a coffin for my dreams
And now I'm losing all I had now
To stay in love by any means
And I'm forgettin' all the time
I should've photographed my mind
She got a little bit of heaven deep inside
And its a heaven I should find

And there's a stagger in our walk
And there's a stutter in our name
And you'll be seeing only white light
And there'll be nothing more to gain

We should be headin' for the top now
We've had a hundred thousand years
Instead we're losing all we got now
To cry a hundred thousand tears

We should be heading for the top now
But we'll be crawling on the floor
Instead we're losing all we got now
To cry a hundred thousand more

Mary, Mary quite contrary
How does your future go?
Backstreet dealin'
Midnight stealin'
Oh does your mother know?

Sadie, Sadie
Quite the lady
How does your fortune grow?
Fixin' hustlin'
Pimpin' cussin'
Don't let the damage show

// Freedom //

Freedom is yours if you want it

// I Am What I Am //

I am the tide that pulls the moon
I am the planet that lights the sun
I am the way that leads the stars
I am the road that drives the cars
I am the rocket ship that blasts the bit that takes you to the stars

I am what I am
Got it in my hand
Hear what I say
See what I am
You understand?

I am the song that writes the mind
I am the man who don't wait for time
I am the heart that feeds your kiss
I am the faith that gets your soul
I am the pound of flesh that signifies the sum of all you're told

I am what I am
Got it in my hand
Hear what I say
See what I am
You understand?

I am the heart that calls you home
I am the grave that marks your stone
I'm misunderstood do you understand?
Like the sea holds back the land
I'm the mishap and coincidence that came out as you planned

I am what I am
Got it in my hand
Hear what I say
See what I am
You understand?

// Mary //

Mary, take your big brown eyes and look away
You're searching in vain
Mary take your big red heart and turn around
They'll make you insane

You know you're getting beat in the morning
Spend the night on the tiles
You know you're only searching for glory
But now you've gone and missed it by miles

Mary, take your healing hands and turn around
There's nothing to save
Mary, take you words of love and tear them out
They're starting to fade

You know you're gonna hurt in the morning
Spend the night all alone
You know you're only searching for glory
But now you gotta face it alone

You know you're getting beat in the morning
Spend the night on the tiles
You know you're only searching for glory
But now you've gone and missed it by miles

Mary, you know this life's so sweet
And filled with stuff that ain't yet dead
Mary, you know we both had dreams
But you're the one who got to live them instead

// Life Is A Problem //

Jesus won't you be my radio
Broadcast direction where I got to go
Send me your signal and I will receive
Jesus please be there to take care of me

Jesus please be my automobile
Won't get to heaven 'less God's at the wheel
Send me your chauffeur and I will get in
Jesus please drive me away from my sin

And I won't get to heaven
I won't be coming home
I will not see my mother again
'cause I'm lost and I'm gone
And this life is too long
And my willpower's never to strong

Jesus please be my aeroplane
Fly me to heaven and ever again
Will I be weak-willed, stoned, or get high
Jesus please meet me the day that i die

Jesus please be my bullet and gun
Shoot all the sinners down, every one
Kill all my demons and that will be fine
But I will be reloading all of the time

And I won't get to heaven 
I won't be coming home
I will not see my mother again
'cause I'm lost and I'm gone
And this life is too long
And my willpower's never too strong

[repeat]

// So Long You Pretty Thing //

If you feel lonely
and the world's against you
take the long way home
past the scary Jesus
and you'll find
my door with your name in diamonds
and you'll feel lonely
no more

Help me lord help me Jesus
'Cause I'm lonely and tired
Help me lord it ain't easy
'Cause I'm living with the blind
I got no reason to believe in anything

Help me lord help Jesus
'Cause I'm hurting inside
Help me lord it ain't easy
'Cause I'm living a lie
and god I'm hoping for a reason to be here

Help me lord help me father
'Cause I'm losing my mind
Help me lord its getting harder
'Cause I'm losing all the time
I got no reason to believe in anymore

Help me lord help me father
'Cause I wasted all my time
Help me lord it's getting harder
'Cause I've made a mess of mine
and god I'm hoping for the reason to be clear

So long you pretty thing
save your little soul
The music that you played so hard
on your radio
All your dreams and diamond rings
and all that rock and roll can bring you
So long, so long
