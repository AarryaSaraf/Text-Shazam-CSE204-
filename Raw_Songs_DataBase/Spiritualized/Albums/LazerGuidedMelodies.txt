// You Know It's True //

You know I've been here before
And I don't like it anymore
You know its true, but what could I do
You know I've felt this before
And I don't need it anymore
You know it's true, I love you
I love you, I love you

// If I Were With Her Now //

You know I'm tired, I got a fevered brow
You know I'd change if I were with her now
You gave me drugs you said 'd cure my ills
They may cure yours but mine are with me still
If I were with her now
If I were with her now
If I were with her now

// I Want You //

I want you to realize it's my life
I want you to realize it ain't paradise
I want you to glide with the air you breathe
I want you to set me free
I'm gonna climb to the highest hill
Gonna take control, I'm gonna free my will
I'm gonna swallow it whole like some giant new pill
Cause I believe it every day
And I believe it wont go away
And I believe it every day
I want you

I want you to realize it's your life
I want you to take my advise

I want you to slide with your soul and see
I want you to set me free

I'm gonna drive to the highest hill
Gonna take control I'm gonna free my will
I'm gonna swallow it whole like some giant new pill
Cause I believe it every day
And I believe it wont go away
And I believe it everyday
I want you

I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you
Slide with your soul and see

// Run //

They call me the breeze
I keep rollin' down the road
They call me the breeze
I keep rollin' then I'm gone

I ain't gotten me nobody
I ain't carryin me no load
You better run run run run run run run run now babe
You better run run run run run run run run now babe

// Smiles //

And when you shine
You know you take
A massive part out of me
And when you smile
You know you blind me
To all the horrors I see

// Step Into The Breeze //

So fine
got everything i need
you got me down on my bended knees
you know to lay me down
when I'm feeling slow
COME ON

so fine
got everything I want
you got me hummin oh that song
you know to lay me back
you know it's true
my baby gives me much more than i can use
you know to lay me back
when I'm feeling slow
COME ON

the river cools
I believe
I wanna step into the breeze
COME ON

// Take Your Time //

Take your time, and back up a little bit
C'mon now people, get yourselves out of it
No chains can hold me, no walls confine me
C'mon now people, c'mon and slide with me
Cos I'm blind, but not as blind as blind as you
I'm sick, there's not a thing I wanna do about it
I'm dumb, but now I wanna mouth off about it
I'm tired of it all, I guess that I am through with it all
Yeah I'm tired of it all, I guess that I am through with it all
Take good care of it babe
You know its goin slow but it's comin your way
You know we keep talking 'bout a revolution
But the air's so thin and you're still polluting it
You know we keep talkin but its so frustrating
Hell you know we keep talkin but theres no mistaking it
Take good care of it babe
Take good care of it babe

// Shine A Light //

When I'm tired and all alone
Lord shine a light on me
And when I'm lonesome as can be
Lord shine a light on me
When I'm tired and all alone
Lord shine a light on me
And when I'm lonesome as can be
Lord shine a light on me
Lord shine a light on me
Lord shine a light on me
Lord shine a light on me

// Angel Sigh //

Girl it's like an angels sigh
When I see you walkin' by
Girl y'know the reason why
Girl y'know the reason why
Girl y' know I've nothin' left
I'm just a feather on your breath
Girl y'know the reason why
Girl y'know the reason why

// 200 Bars //

(Bars 1-100 counted aloud)
I've been abused, and I've been used
I'm gonna lose my thoughts in 200 bars
You know I've tried, but I know I'm tired
I'm losing track of time 200 bars
I get confused, y'know I'm used to it
I'm gonna lose my thoughts in 200 bars
I've had my fix, too much of this
I'm losing all my thoughts in 200 bars
I'm losing track, out on my back
I'm gonna lose it all in 200 bars
Gonna get me blown, all on my own
I'm gonna lose my mind in 200 bars
I'm gonna lose my thoughts in 200 bars
I'm losing track of time in 200 bars
I've been abused, and I've been used
I'm gonna lose my thoughts in 200 bars
Y'know I tried, but now I'm tired
I'm losing track of time in 200 bars
'200'
