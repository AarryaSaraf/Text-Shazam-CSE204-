Hey Jane where you goin' today?
You took a car then you ran all day.
That clock goin' 110. I never said I'd
get back again. Said I ain't got
time to make no mistakes. Ain't got
time to waste my brakes

Hey Jane where you goin' today?
Lit a fire then you fanned the flame.
They say you got a troubled soul.
I say you got it on a roll. You said
ain't got time to change your ways. 
Ain't got time to make no mistakes 
with you.

Show them what you can do. 

Hey Jane where you goin' today?
Ain't got lobe for you anyway. You
get so tired of hanging around. I'll
meet you there when you're comin'
down. Well you got good style and you 
a little taste. Carved your name
right into my face.

Hey Jane where you goin' today?
You broke my heart and you ran
away. Some say you got a rotten 
soul. But I said 'Janey loves rock 'n' 
roll.' Said you ain't got time, you're
a long time dead. Ain't got time to 
mess my head with you.

Hey Jane where you goin' today?
You hit the fast lane right away.
Got no breaks for your rotten life. 
A heart like yours never satisfied.
Said you ain't got time for such
a waste. You run so fast you get
no place.

Hey Jane where you goin' today?
I'll get a car for you right away. That
cop goin' 110. 'Fast lane' Jane said
'fast line, faster' Ain't got no time to 
make no mistake. Ain't got no time to
waste my time with you. 

Hey Jane where you goin' today?
Hey Jane where you goin' today?
Hey Jane where you goin' today?
Hey Jane where you goin' today?

Hey Jane where you gonna die?
Live life like a butterfly. Feel safe
baby by your side. Cheat death on 
another rid. Hey Jane where you
gonna die? You got wings like a 
butterfly. Meet death baby all
alone. 'Sweet Jane' on the radio.

Hey Jane when you gonna die?
That pain goes right inside. Hey 
Jane got a rotten soul. Hey Jane
got it on a roll. Hey Jane where
you going today? Sweet heart
and fade away.

Hey Jane when you gonna die?
Hey Jane when you gonna die?
Hey Jane when you gonna die?
Hey Jane when you gonna die?

Sweet heart, sweet light,
sweet heart and love of my life.
