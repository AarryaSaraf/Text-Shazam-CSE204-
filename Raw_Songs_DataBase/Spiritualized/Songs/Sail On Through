I'll hold on tight I'll hold on
Was the best thing I could do for you
And when we have some kind of luck
Was like the sun send down from way above

I tell no lie, I tell the truth
You know I just don't need to be with you

If I could hold it down
I would sail on through for you
If I weren't loaded down
I would sail on through for you

Say no more, say no less
You know you took it all but you wanted less
I came on down i gave it all
You know best love lies before the fall

If I could hold it down
I would sail on through for you
If I weren't loaded down
I would sail on through for you
