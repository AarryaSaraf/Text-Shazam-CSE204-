Lord I'm feeling so weary
I guess I'm tired of being alone
So give me one more chance
And Lord I will be coming home

I believe I'm damaged
I believe that I'm wrong
I believe my time ain't long

Lord, I'm feeling so lonely
I should have had it while I could
So give me one more chance
And Lord I will be home for good

I believe I'm damaged
I believe that I'm wrong
I believe my time ain't long

Come on babe hold my hand
We should take it while we can
Believe me now you know you're not alone

Come on babe hold my hand
We should take it while we can
Believe me now you know you're not alone

Lord I'm feeling so weary
You'd better call a doctor in
And give me one more chance
I won't get to heaven the state I'm in

I believe I'm damaged
I believe that I'm wrong
I believe my time ain't long



I'm hoping praying Lord I'm saying
I believe my time ain't long
