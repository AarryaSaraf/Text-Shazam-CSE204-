Though my body gets tired
My mind does it no favors at all
And theres so little time
To do something, something, anything more

And theres no use in crying
About the damage that you've done inside
Theres so little time
To do something, something, anything more

And your eyes say it all
Just like the way they did before
Theres so little time
So do something, something, anything more

Don't cry,baby,cry
As long as you and I
Do more than just survive
Don't cry, have a real good life

And you know the things we do
Mean more to me than you
but the rain just came right through
Don't cry, we'll have a real good life

Though my body gets old
My mind does it no favors at all
Theres so little time
To do something, something, anything more

And there's no use in crying
About the damage that you've done inside
Theres so little time
To do something, something, anything more

And your eyes say it all
Just like the way they did before
Theres so little time
So do something, something, anything more

Theres no use in crying
Theres no use in crying
Theres no use in crying
Theres no use in crying
Theres no use in crying
Theres no use in crying
