Well, you take it all so easy
Gonna lay it on my friends
Gonna lay it all on down now baby
Do it all again
I can just hold my time up
lay it against the wall
I can't just hold my tongue
I could for-fuckin'-get it all
I'm gonna lay my soul out
and then I'm gonna lay it all on you

Well you might not crave it all but you can learn from your mistakes
And the little heart of Jesus Christ's gonna lay it all to waste

It's a bitter pill to swallow
But I'll fuckin' neck 'em all
The further you go up now baby
The further you can fall
I'm gonna take my soul out and lay it back, oh babe, again, again

Well you may not be good looking but you haven't got no faith
Sometimes I get a mouthful when I only want a taste
Sometimes you kick the devil out but angels smash your face
You can lay the law out baby but I don't think I'll behave
I'm gonna lay my soul out and then I'm gonna take it out again
I'm gonna lay my soul out and then I'm going down, again, again
(yeah)
