My momma said when she got so concerned
don't play with fire and you'll never get burned
don't touch the flame and you'll never find out
my momma said thats what loves all about

but its too late I've made up made mind 
love always shows when theres eyes that can blind
too late something I've learned
love like the flame

my moma said if you cant find a friend 
don't get to close cause you know it may end
don't get to deep cause you know you'll regret
heart ache and pain in love thats what you get

but its too late I've made up made mind 
love always shows when theres eyes that can blind
too late some thing I've learned
love  lights the flame when theres hearts that get burned

this is dedicated baby
what more can I say
I wont love you more that I love you today
and I wont love you less but I've made my mistakes
stay away from love dear if thats what it takes

but its too late I've made up made mind 
love always shows when theres eyes that can blind
too late something I've learned
love  lights the flame when theres hearts that get burned

too late, too late I've made up made mind 
love always shows when theres hearts that can break
