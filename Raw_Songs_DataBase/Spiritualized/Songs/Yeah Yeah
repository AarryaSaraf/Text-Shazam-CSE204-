Hey babe gonna make you mine
Been mine since the day I arrived
Ain't gonna let it go that way
Gonna make you mine and make my day
I said yeah yeah gonna take it all
Have faith and yet to fall
Gonna gather mine right by my side

Gotta lay it on, alone we die
what a waste of precious time
I swear my mind ain't round oh yeah
I wanna know how long we're here
I don't know but I'll make a guess
'Bout a life away from death
I ain't so over qualified I'm out of here a long time
Yeah get it on
yeah yeah get it on
It's so undignified I'm out of here a long time
Yeah Yeah
