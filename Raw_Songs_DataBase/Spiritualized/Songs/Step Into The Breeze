So fine
got everything i need
you got me down on my bended knees
you know to lay me down
when I'm feeling slow
COME ON

so fine
got everything I want
you got me hummin oh that song
you know to lay me back
you know it's true
my baby gives me much more than i can use
you know to lay me back
when I'm feeling slow
COME ON

the river cools
I believe
I wanna step into the breeze
COME ON
