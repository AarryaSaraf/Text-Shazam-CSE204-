Lord it's so hot and I ain't got a lot
Don't need much but I ain't satisfied right now
I just want water I just want an ocean
An endless river to wash away all of my tears

Lord it's so hot and my heart's bleeding
Ain't been with you but it's you I'm needing right now

I just want water I just want an ocean
An endless river to wash away all of my tears

When your hot and lord how it's steaminh
You gotta go back to the river babe
I just want water I just want an ocean
An endless river to take me back to my shame
