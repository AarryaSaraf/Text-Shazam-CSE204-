Baby I''m just a fool, tearing all my heart out just for you
It gets so hard to do, I''m cold and cored and fried and juiced like you
Oh hey, my mama said "Now, come on let's head it out of here"
Heaven, it ain''t easy, you know I got the scars to say I'm here

So easy to hold your hand, so hard to let it show
You're so fucking self-assured, I'd rather let you down than let you go
There ain''t nowhere you have been that I need to go
There ain''t nothing you can learn that I need to know

Baby I''m just a man, but I''ve got the dreams of gods and kings
Well I can't hold my thoughts, my mind is full of a thousand different things
I get some blood inside and I can't even see the stuff, it's clear
Hell, it should be easy but I''ve got the heart of men of fear

So easy to hold your hand, so hard to let it go
So fucking weird inside, I'd rather let you down than let you go
There ain''t nothing that you can teach me that I need to know
There ain''t nothing you can give me that I need to own

Baby I''m just a fool, tearing all my heart out just for you
It gets so hard to do, I'm cold and cored and fried and juiced like you
Oh hey, my mama said "Now, come on let's head it out of here"
Heaven, it ain''t easy, you know I got the scars to say I'm here

So easy to hold your hand, so hard to let it show
You're so fucking self-assured, I'd rather let you down than let you go
There ain''t nowhere you have been that I need to go
There ain''t nothing you can learn that I need to know
