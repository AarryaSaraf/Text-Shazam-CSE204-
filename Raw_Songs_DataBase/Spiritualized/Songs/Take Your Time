Take your time, and back up a little bit
C'mon now people, get yourselves out of it
No chains can hold me, no walls confine me
C'mon now people, c'mon and slide with me
Cos I'm blind, but not as blind as blind as you
I'm sick, there's not a thing I wanna do about it
I'm dumb, but now I wanna mouth off about it
I'm tired of it all, I guess that I am through with it all
Yeah I'm tired of it all, I guess that I am through with it all
Take good care of it babe
You know its goin slow but it's comin your way
You know we keep talking 'bout a revolution
But the air's so thin and you're still polluting it
You know we keep talkin but its so frustrating
Hell you know we keep talkin but theres no mistaking it
Take good care of it babe
Take good care of it babe
