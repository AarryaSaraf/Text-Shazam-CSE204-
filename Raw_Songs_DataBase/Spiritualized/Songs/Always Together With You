If you want a radio
I would be a radio for you
If you want an aeroplane
I would be an aeroplane for you
If you got a lonely heart
I would be a lonely heart for you
If you want a rocket ship
I would be a rocket ship for you

If you walk the galaxies
I would walk the galaxies for you
If you'll be my lonely girl
I would be a lonely boy for you
If you want a shooting star
I would be a shooting star for you
If you want another world
I would be another world for you
If you want a universe
I would be a universe for you

Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always forgetting with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always forgetting with you (If you have a lonely heart too)

If you want a silver moon
I would be a silver moon for you
If you want a unicorn
I would be a unicorn for you
If you want a satellite

Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always forgetting with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always forgetting with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)

Just when you thought your life came
In a bag of white
Sucked up a silver tube
Changes your attitude
Stay with your valentine
Catie and Constantine
Just when you thought it right
Mercury's out tonight

Just like a dream come true
Catie's in love with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Just when you thought it right
Catie is out of sight (If you have a lonely heart too)
Just when you thought your life
Came in a bag of white (If you have a lonely heart too)
Sucked up a silver tube
Changes your attitude (If you have a lonely heart too)

Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always forgetting with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always forgetting with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
Always together with you (If you have a lonely heart too)
