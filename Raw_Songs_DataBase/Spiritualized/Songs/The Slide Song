Hey you know that I've been searching deep inside
And I'm not certain I will like the things I find
I don't know that you will understand but I have tried

I don't know just why I need to do the things I do
And I'd love to do these things without them hurting you
I don't know that you will understand but that's the truth

I'd give it up for you but let me finish what I got
I'd love to now but lord you know it sure does take a lot
I'll always love you honey but I can't be
What I'm not
