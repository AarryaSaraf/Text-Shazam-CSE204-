You got to hold on baby
to those who hold dear
and have gone to people
you love

cuz death cannot part us
if life already has
hold on to those you hold dear

you got to hold on
baby to those that you love
cuz hell's not below us
or heaven above

and death cannot say
what you're already lost
hold on to those you hold dear

you got a hold on baby
to those you hold dear

you get back the love
that you send

and time makes it harder
where words already failed

hold on to those you hold dear

got to hold on baby
to those who hold dear
and gone to the people
you love

cuz death cannot part us
if life already has

hold on to those you hold dear
