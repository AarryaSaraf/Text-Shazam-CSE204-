Don't hold me close
You're not the one
that I can most
rely upon
But I'll be here
when you are done
and maybe time
will just make a sweetheart of you

Don't touch me there
your fire's too bright
and I don't care
to travel light
But I'll be here
when you are through
and maybe time
will just make a sweetheart of you

And in the night
I'll dream of you
and hope my aim
is straight and true
But I'll be here
when you are through
and maybe time
will just make a sweetheart of you
