Gotta fire inside my soul
Let it burn and let it glow
Gotta fire to call my own
Freedom's mine to hold
Gotta fire and bide my time
Praise the Lord and I'll find out
Hold on and blow my mind
Freedom's one more fight
3000 miles from home
Gotta a gun to call my own
Ain't no religion here
Gotta fire, Lord I got a fire now
Gotta letter from my home
Didn't know my mind was blown
Gotta get the feelin' back
Gotta fire, Lord got a fire now
Gotta light inside my soul
Let it burn and let it glow
Gotta cause to call my own
Gotta fire, Lord got a fire
Freedom's lost its 
Ain't got no love in here
Gotta job 
Gotta fire Lord I got a fire now
Sometimes you know it ain't right
Get the car to get it right
Ain't no religion here
Gotta fire Lord I got a fire now
Gotta fire inside my soul
Let it burn and let it glow
Aint no religon here
Gotta fire Lord i got a fire
