Holly, you don't wake up, you're going out here in a van
Oh, and you're lying straight back
You're going out the way you can
Oh, and your eyes roll back
They roll back to where you been
Oh, and you roll that die, you never get a roll to win

Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had
Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had

Holly, you'd best sit down
You're losing the will to go
How did you blow that mind, you never had a mind to blow?
Oh, and you love that life, you're going out here in a van
Oh, and your eyes roll back, you'd best see it the way you can

Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had
Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had
Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had
Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had

Holly, you laid it down
You're losing the will to go
Oh, and you loved that life, you're too proud to let it show
Honey, your eyes rolled back, the best thing you've ever done
Oh, and your wasted time, you best let the water run
Holly, you best sit down, you're going out here in a van
Oh, and your lesson's learned, you take more the more you can

Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had
Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had
Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had
Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had

Honey, you're laid in doubt, you're never getting anything done
Oh, you're wasting time, you best let the water run
Oh, your eyes light up, the best thing you ever knew
Honey, you best sit down, the good times will come to you
Honey, you lived that life, you're never getting out for free
Honey, you walked that walk, you'll never walk back to me

Gonna be a long ride down
Come on, Holly, we'll take it from here
