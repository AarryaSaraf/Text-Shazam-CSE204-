Jesus Christ,
When your back's against the wall
It's sure hard to be grateful
When you've nothing here at all
You say that Hell's below us, Lord
Heaven can be mine
I don't believe your promises
I don't believe your lies

And, Lord, let it rain on me
Let it all come down
I'll sell my soul to let it roll
And I'm about ready now

Lord, let it rain on me
Now I know I'm goin' down
I've got a little knowledge, Lord
And I'm about ready now

Jesus Christ,
Look at what you've gone and done
2,000 years of lookin' down
The barrel of a gun
You got the fools believin'
That there's something else to gain
Jesus Christ,
When you comin' down again?

And, Lord, let it rain on me
Let it all come down
I'll sell my soul to let it roll
And I'm about ready now

Lord, let it rain on me
Now I know I'm goin' down
I've got a little knowledge, Lord
And I'm about ready now

And, Lord, let it rain on me
Let it all come down
I'll sell my soul to let it roll
And I'm about ready now

Lord, let it rain on me
Now I know I'm goin' down
I've got a little knowledge, Lord
And I'm about ready now

And, Lord, let it rain on me
Let it all come down
I'll sell my soul to let it roll
And I'm about ready now

Lord, let it rain on me
Now I know I'm goin' down
I've got a little knowledge, Lord
And I'm about ready now

And, Lord, let it rain on me
Let it all come down
I'll sell my soul to let it roll
And I'm about ready now

Lord, let it rain on me
Now I know I'm goin' down
I've got a little knowledge, Lord
And I'm about ready now
