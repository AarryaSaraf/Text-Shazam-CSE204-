Feeling
Every day
You ain't got no reason
To walk away
I'm healing
Operate
Help me find the meaning
On the way

What I gotta do?
To start up with you
What I gotta do?
To start something new
What I gotta do?
To start living in the sunshine every day

Let's talk about it
Don't run
Please just talk about it
How you changed my life
Let's talk about it
Don't run
'Cause I knew you when you came along

(Let's talk about it)
(Don't run)

True love
Won't pretend
We don't need no slowdance in the sand
Promise you I'll feel good once again
And I'll be there with you
When it ends

What I gotta do?
To start up with you
What I gotta do?
To start something new
What I gotta do?
To start living in the sunshine every day

Let's talk about it
Don't run
We just talk about it
How you changed my life
Let's talk about it
Don't run
'Cause I knew you when you came along

The highs and lows
I will always be there
The higher you go
I will always be there
The highs and lows
I will always be there
The higher you go
I will always be there
I will always be there
I will always be there

Let's talk about it
Don't run
We just talk about it
How you changed your life
Let's talk about it
Don't run
'Cause I knew you when you came along

(Let's talk about it)
(Let's talk about it)
(Don't run)
