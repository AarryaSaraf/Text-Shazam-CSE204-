I've been dreamin' nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin'

Come back a different day
If you wait
Day, night
Sunshine finds you

Different times
Different lives, yeah
Oh now, now
Did you think you could change it?

I don't know, I was just laughin' away
Hidin' there
Come back a different day

Yes, you wanted to feel that
Only moonlight would get in your way
Day, night
Sunshine finds you

Different times
Different lives, yeah
Oh now, now
Did you think you could change it?

I don't know, I was just laughin' away
Hidin' there
Come back a different day

Anyway
Come back a different day

I've been dreamin' nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin'
Come back a different day
Get in your way
I've been dreamin' nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin'
