My name is Fannie and I like to dance a lot
I'll take you on the floor and make you real hot
Do think that I'm a bad girl because I like to dance a lot
But you'll still be my baby if I didn't like to dance a lot

My name is Fannie and I like to dance a lot
Alot, alot, alot
I'll take you on the floor and make you real hot
Hot Hot Hot
This the kind of dancing I'm talking about
This the kind of dancing that makes me scream
And shout

It seems like seems like a bad curse
Eveery day gets a little worse
I don't know why I want to dance,
Everytime I get a chance

My name is Fannie and I like to dance a lot
Alot, alot, aLot
I'll take you on the floor and make you real hot
Hot hot hot
This the kind of dancing I'm talking about
This the kind of dancing that makes me scream
And shout

My name is Fannie and I like to dance a lot
I'll take you on the floor and make you real hot
