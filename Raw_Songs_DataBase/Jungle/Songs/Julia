It's calling on me
If what I see is true
To me your just a girl
And it's starting baby

Julia
I don't know a thing about you
Soon enough
You'll be all I ever need

Are you mad about me?
Or do you see a fool?
To me your just the girl
Tell me
If it's starting baby
All I ever need

Too easy
All I ever need
Too cold
You'll be all I ever need
Too near me
All I ever need
Too slow
To me you're just the girl
You know that I could be the one
All I ever need
To get through
All I ever need

Julia
I can't do a thing without you
Soon enough
You'll be all I ever need
