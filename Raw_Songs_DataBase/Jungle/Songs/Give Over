Give over
You're not getting closer
It's over
You and I are so much older

And I hold such hope in a song that saved my life
Never gonna chase it now
And you got wrapped up getting on with your life
Never gonna chase it now

Never gonna chase it
Never gonna chase it now

Give over
You're not getting closer
California
And all the times you were out there

And I hold such hope in a song that saved my life
Never gonna chase it now
And you got wrapped up getting on with your life
Never gonna chase it now

Run free
Run free
Run free
Run free

Never gonna chase it
Never gonna chase it now

Give over
You're not getting closer
It's over
You and I are so much older

And I hold such hope in a song that saved my life
Never gonna chase it now
And you got wrapped up getting on with your life
Never gonna chase it now

I said you're feeling nothing
I know you're seeing someone
I said you're feeling nothing
I know you're seeing someone
I said you're feeling nothing
I know you're seeing someone...
I said, said, said...
I know you're seeing someone...
