When you're so high you (Don't think)
When you fall from the sky you (Won't break)

So come down from the clouds 
Come down 
So some down from the clouds 
Come down 

I've been loving you, too long
I've been loving you, for too long. 

So some down from the clouds 
Come down 
So some down from the clouds 
Come down 

When you're so high, you don't think 
When you fall from the sky, you won't break. 
I've been loving you too long. 
I've been loving you for too long.
