When you smile
When you smile the world feels a little better
I just wanna see you smile
When you try, when you try
The world moves over baby
I just wanna see you try

You better know one day
A little closer now to find in your way
Oh let the sons lead, let the sons lead the way

When you smile
When you smile the world feels a little together
This day wanna see you smile
You and I
You and I can take all the world
I just think of you and I

You better know one day
A little closer now to find in your way
So let the sons lead, let the sons lead the way

Won't let you fall, no, oh I
Won't let you fall, no, oh I
Won't let you fall, no, oh I
Won't let you fall, no, no
Won't let you fall, no, oh I
Won't let you fall, no, oh I
Won't let you fall, no, oh I
I won't let you fall, fall, fall, fall, fall, fall, fall, fall, oh, no
I won't let you, I won't let you, I won't let you, I won't let you, I won't let you
