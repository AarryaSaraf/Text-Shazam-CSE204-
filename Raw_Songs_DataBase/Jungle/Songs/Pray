Give me a reason to love you
Every night
'Cos I've seen life without you lately
And it hurts me
I've seen the visions
Of the bad times
In my head
But I won't let them take control of me

Every single night I pray
(I pray...)

Giving you a reason to trust me
Every day
But no one said this would be easy
And it hurts me
That I ever lied to you
In the bad times
It was in my head
But I won't let them take control of me

Every single night I pray (I pray...)
Every single night I can feel it
Passing by

(I pray...)

Tell me you need me
To love you
Anyway
It's not like we'll be here forever
And all of the decisions
You expected
That I never made
Come with the visions and the truth is

Every single night I pray (I pray...)
Every single night I can feel it
Passing by

'Cos I've seen life without you lately
And I wanna know just what the truth is
I've seen life without you lately
And I wanna know, I wanna know just what the truth is

Every single night I pray (I pray...)
Every single night I can feel it
Passing by
I can feel it
Passing by
