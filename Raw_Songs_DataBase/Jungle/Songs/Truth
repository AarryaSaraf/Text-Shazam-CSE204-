Tell you for the first time
When you say you wanted proof
Now you wanna be mine
You're looking for that instant truth

So clear the way
It's early wanna get up
Ah, I wanna get it done
With clarity
I know you'll never get it
But I was just having fun

It's the truth
I only wanna wake up for you
It's the truth
I only wanna wake up for you

I was gonna keep trying
Call you when I knew I could
Always wanna rewind
And play it like I knew you would

Anyway
Could tell you wanna get up
Ah, you wanna get up close
Let it fade away
If you wanna get better
Then you gotta let it go

It's the truth
I only wanna wake up for you
It's the truth
I only wanna wake up for you

I come back to find you
Tell you everything I know
You spend all your time at the beach
But you're telling me you're on your own
I won't start it over again
I won't start it over again

It's the truth
I only wanna wake up for you
It's the truth
I only wanna wake up for you

Anyway
Could tell you wanna get up
Ah, you wanna get up close
Let it fade away
If you wanna get better
Then you gotta let it go
