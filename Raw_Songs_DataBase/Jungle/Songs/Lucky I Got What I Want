I steal living
Tell me I'm wrong
Will I be forgiven
If I wanna walk like you
Swing it back when I want

When I find myself next to the
Don't you forget about me
I won't, won't tell nobody
When I find myself next to the
Don't you, I won't
Don't you forget about me
I won't, won't tell nobody
Don't you forget about me

Inside this killing
Cut if I want
Time to leave
Lucky I got what I want

When I find myself next to the
Don't you forget about me
I won't, won't tell nobody
When I find myself next to the
Don't you, I won't
Don't you forget about me
I won't, won't tell nobody
Don't you forget about me

Slow, carefully
Slow, carefully

When I find myself next to the
Don't you forget about me
I won't, won't tell nobody
When I find myself next to the
Don't you, I won't
Don't you forget about me
I won't, won't tell nobody
Don't you forget about me

Don't you forget about me
Don't you forget about me
Don't you forget about me
Don't you forget about me
Don't you forget about me
Don't you forget about me

Lucky I got what I want
