One love
You had it on your own love
Time up to be there
She said she won't care
And now you have something
Before you had nothing
And I want you care
But you lost real
And it's nothing
I cannot be your whole world
And sit on a fake grass
And I won't believe that
And I never had enough for you
But you said someone
Would come and replace me
How can you replace me?

While it's true, It's all good now
Well it's nothing, nothing, nothing
That's only you and I
And this tears
Falling inside now
Well it's nothing, nothing, nothing
That's only you and I

Please don't stop
The video stop
Please don't stop
The video stop
Please don't stop
The video stop
Please don't stop

I got no time for me, wake up, no time for me
There's no time for me
I got no time for me, wake up, no time for me
There's no time for me
I got no time for me, wake up, no time for me
