Looking through my phone
Messages that I know I shouldn't send, already sent
We used to be a major chord
You were the third, I the fourth
Stuck in dissonance
Our love a punishment

I've got you crying

And I'm wishing that you would stay
Would you love me one more day?
Like yesterday
And I'm looking inside your brain
To see your mind's already made
From yesterday

Shackled up just friends
Stuck in dreams of when we were again
I can't begin
Sifting through the same songs baby
Looking for the one that makes me think of you, the way I used to do back when I was your fool

And now I'm crying

And I'm wishing that you would stay
Would you love me one more day?
Like yesterday
And I'm looking inside your brain
To see your mind's already made
From yesterday

Lost and so alone, writing songs I know that don't make sense, and have no end...
