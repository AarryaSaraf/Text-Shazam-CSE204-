I'm the son of a gun
You got a lot to show
Yeah but nobody's talking now

You're the shock I need
Gotta give me a go
Yeah I heard that you give it out

You made the elephant run
It took him to his knees
So why are you giving up?

You can take it from my hands
I just watch you feed,
Cos I know what you think
About

I can't get you out of my mind
I won't let you down
