All of the time. (Keep telling me)
All of the time. (You needed me)
All of the time. (Keep telling me)
All of the time

You never know
When I'm feeling low
Never talk
You're laying low
Better off
I'm beaming up

(It's all alright up there)

Heaven ain't
Big enough
It's evident
I guess it's true
You never did
What you had to do

(If you want, I'll come back and meet you there)
All of the time. (Keep telling me)
All of the time. (You needed me)
All of the time. (Keep telling me)
It's all alright. It's all alright

Why don't we talk in the morning
Want you to need me my love
Could it be easy for us?

(It's all alright up there)

Heaven ain't
Big enough
It's evident
I guess it's true
You never did
What you had to do

(If you want, I'll come back and meet you there)
All of the time. (Keep telling me)
All of the time. (You needed me)
All of the time. (Keep telling me)
It's all alright. It's all alright

All of the time. (Keep telling me)
All of the time. (You needed me)
All of the time. (Keep telling me)
All of the time

All of the time. (Keep telling me)
All of the time. (You needed me)
All of the time. (Keep telling me)
All of the time
