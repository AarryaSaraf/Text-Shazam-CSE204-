Who do you think you're
Kidding now?
Screaming, lying
It's about enough
And all you're kicking up
Yeah it's covering everyone

There's something tonight
Going on down there
So crawl up me baby
All I ever wanted tonight
It's going on down there
So crawl up me baby

Can't wash it off, Joke
Meaning crumbling'
It's hard enough
Got to quicken up
Cos it's all or never now, again
