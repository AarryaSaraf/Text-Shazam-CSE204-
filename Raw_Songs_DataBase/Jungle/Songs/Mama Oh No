Mama, oh no
Mama, help me
Give me wisdom
That I can't see

Mama, help me
'Cause I wanna know what changes
My body's achin'
See it all
Given, everyday I get stoned, it's alright
You make me so cold

Hell on the way
Help me, I'm afraid
No plan
And I hold my hands out

Givin' you everything this time
With you through everything, my love
Givin' you everything this time
I know, it's in my blood

Mama, oh no
Mama, help me
Give me wisdom
That I can't see

Mama, help me
'Cause I wanna know what changes
My body's achin'
See it all (Help me)
Given, everyday I get stoned, it's alright
You make me so cold

Hell on the way
Help me, I'm afraid
No plan
And I hold my hands out

Givin' you everything this time
With you through everything, my love
Givin' you everything this time
I know, it's in my blood

Givin' you everything this time
With you through everything, my love
Givin' you everything this time
I know, it's in my blood

Mama, oh no
Mama, oh no
Mama, don't go
