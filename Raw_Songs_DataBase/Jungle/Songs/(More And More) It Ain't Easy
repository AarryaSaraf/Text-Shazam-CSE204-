I been deceivin'
No, no, come easy

Easy
Oh, this easy
Pass on the feelin'
All my life

Time to be given
Time for the living
Miles to the giving
Somethin' ain't right

Opposite
More and more
It ain't easy
You know they walk on by

More and more
It ain't easy
You know they walk on

I been deceivin'
No, no, come easy

Easy
Oh, this easy
Pass on the feelin'
All my life

Time to be given
Time for the living
Miles to the giving
Somethin' ain't right

Opposite
More and more
It ain't easy
You know they walk on by

More and more
It ain't easy
You know they walk on

I been deceivin'
No, no, come

Realize that you're given
Easy, time to be livin'
Realize that you're given
Time to be livin'

Opposite
More and more
It ain't easy
You know they walk on by

More and more
It ain't easy
You know they walk on

More and more
It ain't easy
You know they walk on by

More and more
It ain't easy
You know they walk on by

I been deceivin'
No, no, come easy
