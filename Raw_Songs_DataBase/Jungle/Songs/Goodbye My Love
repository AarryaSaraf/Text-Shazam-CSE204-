I got a thing
I got a feeling
I gotta say there's a sun that will shine
I gotta burn
I got up early
Only to tell you my love

Did you think it could be your time?
Did you think we could make it right?
If I can't pretend you're mine
I'll be down

God is my girl
She is my teacher
Morning will rise to us all in this town
I gotta learn all for the spirit
Only if you are my love

Did you think it could be your time?
Did you think we could make it right?
If I can't pretend you're mine
I'll be down
