I'm sick of has-beens coming home
Coming home to the world
And it's madness, who do you think you are?

So can I get the car to just start, please
Can I get the gas to go high speeds
Cause everything just happened at once
And everything just happened at once
You see, please

And it's magic, and it's strong
I am strong in the morn
Yeah in the magic, if you knew who you are

So can I get the car to just start, please
Can I get the gas to go high speeds
Cause everything just happened at once
And everything just happened at once
You see, please

Can I get the car to just start, please
Let me get the gas to go high speeds
Cause everything just happened at once
And everything just happened at once to me
Yeah, me
So please
